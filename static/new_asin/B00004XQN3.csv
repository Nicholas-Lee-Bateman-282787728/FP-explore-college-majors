1369382,2,B00004XQN3,"I found this movie a waste of time.  It really was a long 90 minutes.  I suppose if I had liked or even known the actors I might have found some enjoyment in it, but I only knew the one and she is not one of my favorites.  The music was very nice, with old hymns used in the score and played on period instruments.  This movie really put me to sleep.  I found the script dull and lifeless.  I do love period pieces, but this one was sorely lacking compared to the BBC productions.  I would recommend that you borrow this from your library before buying it (try an inter-library loan if your library doesn't have it).  I would hate to see someone spend over $20 on this and find that it was a waste of time to watch it.",1116374400,12,718,4.042553191489362
1369383,4,B00004XQN3,"When ""the Europeans"" arrive unexpectedly to stay at the New England home of their strait-laced cousins, the Wentworth family, the conflicts between European and American values, so often highlighted in the novels of Henry James, are quickly established in this 1979 Merchant-Ivory film.  Screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala stays close to the tone, themes, and action of the James novel as she brings to life a strict and pious New England family which is suddenly exposed to a whole new way of life.  Felix Young (Tim Woodward), a charming and energetic European artist/actor/traveler, without prospects in Europe, has accompanied his sister Eugenia, Baroness of Munster (Lee Remick), to America while her marriage is being dissolved.  Here, where no one knows them, Eugenia believes that ""natural relations,"" as opposed to the ""artificial relations"" of Europe will prevail.

Young Gertrude Wentworth (Lisa Eichhorn), always the most iconoclastic member of the family, is immediately smitten by Felix, finding him a welcome relief from the earnest but stuffy Rev. Brand (Norman Snow), who has been courting her.  While Felix and Gertrude are discovering each other, Eugenia works her wiles on the Wentworth men, focusing both on Clifford (Tim Choate), the young son and Wentworth heir-to-be, and on neighbor Robert Acton (Robin Ellis), flirting and awakening them to new and exciting possibilities.

The late autumn foliage sets off the Federal Period homes (the exterior being the Barrett House in New Ipswich, NH, and some interiors from the Salem [MA] National Heritage site), all perfectly maintained and appropriately furnished, which serve as the setting for the action, and the cinematography (Larry Pizer), shows off naturally beautiful outdoor scenes (some of which take place in an elegant antique gazebo), along with dreadful rains and mud.  The original score by Richard Robbins is one of the film's highlights--romantic without being cloying, and often haunting. Jill Eichhorn, as Gertrude, is charming as she represses her sense of fun at the beginning and then lets go, under the influence of the captivating Felix.

Well photographed, winningly scored, and beautiful to look at, this early Merchant-Ivory film is a lovely entertainment, but it does have two weaknesses.  The father (as played by Wesley Addy) seems unrealistically puritanical, especially for a man who reads the transcendentalists, lives only seven miles from Boston, and is a Unitarian (not a dogmatic denomination). And Lee Remick, as Eugenia, is too mature for the role.  In her mid-forties when she makes this film, her serious flirting with twenty-ish Clifford does not ring true, nor does her calculating manipulation of the family.  Lacking the depth of the novel, the film is a wry and often humorous look at mid-19th century life.  Mary Whipple",1093392000,14,2835,5.346067415730337
1369384,4,B00004XQN3,"This beautiful adaptation of the Henry James novel of the same name is an early Ivory/Merchant film. It is beautifully shot with shimmering pastoral scenes that bring to mind some wonderful impressionist paintings. The story is likewise somewhat impressionistic and centered around two brother and sister expatriates, Eugenia and Felix Young, who come from Europe to visit their wealthy American half cousins, the Wentworths, in the very bucolic, very Yankee, suburban environs of Boston in the late nineteenth century.
The Wentworths are a rather strait-laced, prim and proper, wealthy family, whose head is the dour and mistrustful old Mr. Wentworth (Wesley Addy). The family welcomes their European cousins with some trepidation and reservation, as they seem positively bohemian to them. The one exception is Gertrude Wentworth (Lisa Eichhorn) who gravitates towards her newly found, sophisticated relatives. As a flower turns to the sun,  Gertrude turns to her cousins to brighten her otherwise dull and narrow world. She is not disappointed.
Eugenia (Lee Remick) proclaims to be the Baroness Munster, an unhappily married woman on the brink of divorce. Her charming brother, Felix (Tim Woodward), is a rather artistic  fellow with no foreseeable prospects. Together they take the Wentworths by storm and turn their previously well ordered, somewhat provincial world, upside down. This is a slow moving film that allows the story to unfold at its own, unhurried pace.
As Eugenia and Felix leisurely weave themselves into the fabric of the Wentworths' lives, changes  ensue.  During their stay, a romance develops between Felix and Gertrude. Her rebuffed suitor, Mr. Brand (Norman Snow), ends up finding solace in the arms of Charlotte, Gertrude's more eminently suited sister. Eugenia, however, who has set about to snare the Wentworths' attractive and wealthy neighbor, Robert Acton (Robin Ellis), is in for a very rude awakening.
Lee Remick, a vastly underrated actress, is delightful as the beautiful and predatory Eugenia. Tim Woodward is boyishly charming as Felix, the cousin who sweeps Gertrude off her feet. Robin Ellis is excellent as the thoughtful Robert Acton, the man who stands on the brink of a major life changing decision. Wesley Addy is very good as the suspicious Wentworth patriarch. Lisa Eichhorn's portrayal of Gertrude, however, is flat, as if she were performing in the throes of a zen like trance. Yet, it does not detract unduly from the overall quality of the film.
This is a film that those who love period pieces will enjoy. If you are not a period piece lover, however, deduct one star from my review and proceed at your own risk.",1022976000,32,2664,5.2172897196261685
1369385,1,B00004XQN3,"This is an early and lesser Merchant/Ivory period piece featuring a visit of Europeans Lee Remick and Tim Woodward to their Bostonian cousins, however the staging is so stiff director James Ivory may have well used mannequins. The soundtrack is very busy, what with the rustling of dresses and singing birds but also features the lovely Richard Robbins score which livens things up a smidgen. Miraculously a little of Henry James' humour survives when delivered by Woodward and the disapproving Bostonian father played by Wesley Addy. Together they have a very funny chat about having a portrait painted. Woodward has the misfortune to fall in love with Lisa Eichhorn, possibly the dullest of all the family, and she scores an unintentional laugh when she tells him how ""dreary"" he must find her. The ageless Lee Remick has a few moments of fun. I particularly liked her panic in the first meeting. Remick isn't believable as a predator - she's rather too light - though she is amusing when bored, but the only thing vaguely European about her is her odd hairdos. One might have a moral objection to the idea of marrying one's cousin, though perhaps this inbreeding shouldn't be judged by contemporary standards. Of note is James' using ""pleased to"" instead of ""would you please"" in requests.",970531200,17,1292,4.931192660550459

1369398,5,B00004XQN3,"One of my Amazon friends recently completed his reading of all things Henry James. (He owns the complete, multi-volumed set of Library of America.) Thus, as I was flipping through channels last night, looking for a movie to watch, I came upon ""The Europeans"" with Lee Remick. A 1979 film based on James's novel by the same name, this version by Ivory/Merchant is a period film (meaning not an action flick!). After the first two minutes, I knew this would be a film not for the action junkie.

Instead, there it is--a film of exceptional beauty, depicting the breathtaking leaves of fall in New England. The opening scene shows a woman, hair tightly screwed up into a fanciful arrangement, walking across a carpeted lawn of golden and bronze leaves to enter a gazebo and there read a romantic novel. You see, this woman, Gertrude, is not of her family in beliefs or attitudes. After she meets her cousin from Europe and learns that people can be free, she tells her sister she wants to scream. Then she goes to her room, muffles her face on the bed and does, indeed, scream. In fact, what she ultimately want is to be ""outed"" as a free thinker. Ah, so Henry James--quiet, delicate, yet deliberate.

A year before this novel ""The Europeans"" was published, James published the reverse version, ""The Americans,"" a story of ""raw, uncultured"" Americans who visit Europe and show that Americans, ummmm, do not know the niceties of discrete behavior of improper acts. When available, rich Robert Acton invites Eugenie to travel to Niagra Falls with him, she is shocked, not at his invitation, but at her disappointment that he has nothing more in mind to unite them. After all, coming to America to find a rich husband was her goal.

After two majorly disappointing films of stories by Nicholas Sparks and their devastatingly sad endings, I fully expected that nothing would go right here either. I don't know my James apparently. Not one, but three successful couplings take place. But, oh, that puritanical Robert Acton cannot let go of his proper beliefs. Even the truly and purely puritanical pastor shifts his love to another when it best suits, not only his interests, but others as well.

""The Europeans"" is a quietly enjoyable film with things ending well that should end well. Good ol' James!",1315526400,3,2294,4.8
1369399,4,B00004XQN3,"Lee Remick was superb in this movie. The photography was also spectacular indicating change of season and
inside characterizations. The old world and the New World with customs and manners was well represented.
It was fun to see this movie.",1297987200,,240,5.025
1369400,5,B00004XQN3,"I saw this movie in a theatre 25 years ago, shortly after having read Henry James' novel, and I remember how impressed I was not only by the movie's accuracy, delicacy, splendour and faithfulness to the novel, but also by the fact that it manages to ""repair"" some shortcomings of Henry James' early novel.

I have been longing to watch it again ever since, so I eventually bought the DVD. Redescovering it, I was surprised by its incredible freshness and newness, after so many years. It is, indeed, a superb adaptation of James' novel, and one of the most interesting Ivory/Merchant film.

The October New England landscapes are breathtaking, costumes have authenticity, dialogues are spontaneous, and the script features without effort or ostentation the differences between the European and the American mentalities and behaviours; the atmosphere is as genuine as it can be rendered in a movie.

Acting is exceptional; the gradual symptoms of love in the main characters (the two young Americans and their European cousins) are incredibly well expressed: we witness their delight, astonishment, fever, torments, doubts, pain. But far from being graphically shown, the feelings are mostly suggested, so we guess, beyond the self-imposed discretion and reserve, the strong dilemmas and the inner fights. The real drama and utter changes in the characters' lives are like whirlpools under the perfectly calm surface of a lake. This contributes to the (false) impression of slowness or stagnation of the movie--and this, in spite of the multitude of events that occur so naturally, ""comme si de rien n'tait"".

The characters' strong individuality is well depicted, the Wentworths naivety and simplicity is touching, Eugenia's (Lee Remick--amazing!) sophistication is truthful. The ending (one marriage and one painful separation, the latter because of the beautiful European woman's ""decadence"") also represents a great achievement in the movie: managing to avoid any moralizing preach (or inference), the filmmakers offer an elusive, smooth, easily-flowing, almost smiling ending.

I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who searches aesthetic pleasure, subtle acting and also loves Henry James.",1260057600,21,2198,5.471976401179941
1369401,3,B00004XQN3,"""The Europeans"" (1979) was the first Merchant-Ivory adaptation of a Henry James novel and was later followed by ""The Bostonians"" (1984) and ""The Golden Bowl"" (2000).  The story concerns a puritan American family, The Wentworths, who live outside Boston in the mid-1800s.  They lead a quiet life filled with temperance and religion, but that all changes when their two European cousins show up for a visit unexpectedly.  Artistic Felix Young (Tim Woodward) arrives first and immediately charms one of the Wentworth daughters, the homely Gertrude (Lisa Eichorn).  When Felix fetches his sister, Eugenia (Lee Remick), who also is the Baroness Eugena-Camilla-Dolores Munster, she makes quite a splash with the simple Americans.  Mr. Wentworth (Wesley Addy) is wary of Felix and Eugenia, but at the urging of Gertrude, he agrees to let them stay at a small house on the family's sprawling estate.  We soon discover the reason for their visit - Eugenia, who plans on divorcing her Prince husband, is seeking a wealthy American to marry, which sets into motion the main plotlines.

In many ways, ""The Europeans"" succeeds and is rather enjoyable.  The film has many outdoor scenes shot in various Massachusetts and New Hampshire locations, and the fall scenery is absolutely stunning.  It's worth watching the movie for that alone.  Merchant and Ivory always show an eye for detail, and the decorations, sets, and costumes are gorgeous - the film's only Oscar nomination was for Judy Moorcroft's costume design.  They also got the tone of this comedy of manners nearly right; some of the scenes are genuinely funny and highlight the differences between the Americans and the Europeans.  I haven't read the James novella, but the plot description of the book suggests that the movie is fairly faithful.

Unfortunately, the film overall often feels stilted, almost as if it were a play.  The major debit is that the actors affect such different styles that they often feel as though they're acting in different movies.  Some of this might be purposeful, to highlight the differences between the rough-hewn but disciplined Wentworths and the almost Bohemian Europeans; however, it also just seems poorly aced.  Lisa Eichorn is particularly wooden and non-emotive.  I actually enjoyed Tim Choate's performance as the immature uncultured Wentworth brother, but his acting doesn't meld with the other more uptight performances around him.  In addition, the sets, while beautiful, feel stuffy and museum-like.  The movie ends up feeling like second-rate ""Masterpiece Theater"" instead of first-rate Merchant Ivory.  I'd rank ""The Europeans"" ahead of ""The Bostonians,"" but far behind their masterpieces ""Howards End,"" ""A Room with a View,"" and ""The Remains of the Day.""",1229126400,3,2752,5.268348623853211
1369402,3,B00004XQN3,"This review was written by my wife, Melanie.

The best about this film is the glorious setting in a New England autumn when the colors of the trees are their most vivid.  Interestingly, as revealed in an interview with Merchant/Ivory included on the DVD, the fall setting was not planned, but fortunately occurred because of production delays. The second best about the film is Lee Remick, who turns in a first-rate performance as the Countess Eugenia.

The script has problems, the main criticism being that some of the characters are not believable, such as the puritanical patriarch of the Wentworth family.  He is the typical filmmaker's depiction of religious persons, especially devout Christians--stuffy, intolerant, anti-intellectual and foolish.  This kind of silly sterotype detracts from the film's merits. Mr. Wentworth is reduced to cardboard caricature, when he could have so easily been a real, flesh-and-blood individual. This character treatment insults viewer intelligence, and is a weakness with some of the period Ivory/Merchant productions. While they are richly creative as far as the visual goes (magnificent locations, sumptuous costumes and great photography), they don't always give the audience the same quality when it comes to screenwriting and fleshing out the characters.",1190073600,25,1302,5.522613065326633

1369404,3,B00004XQN3,"Boston High Society of 1850 was dominated by rigid social standard and custom. Into the encumbered world of the wealthy Wentworth clan marches quite unexpectedly their Europeans cousins Felix and Eugenia. The Europeans are ""Bohemian"" lovers of life and of worldly pleasures which is quite opposite of the reserved Unitarian (Congregationalists decending from Presbyterianism)uppercrust of Massachusetts. This film examines the different reactions that Gertrude Wentworth has towards her cousins in stark contrast to much of the the rest of her family and Boston Society. Gertrude becomes ""excited"" and ""impassioned"" for the first time in life,as she falls for her cousin,the wild and admitedly ""happless"" Felix. Cousin Eugenia on the other hand,""looks down her nose"" at The Bostonians and she plays a game of teasing and enticing potential suitors for what is not  always a clear motive. What is the motive of these Europeans in coming to visit their American cousins?

As we come to expect from any Merchant Ivory film,incredible attention is given to costume,colour,sets and gorgeous cinematography interlaced with appropriate classical music of the Era. On that alone this film earns three stars. However,the story is so unrelentingly dull (frankly the book IMO is as well) and with absolutely uninspired acting from everyone WITH the exception of the brilliant and now deceased Lee Remick as Cousin Eugenia,that this film may be one of the longest 90 minutes you may ever spend watching a film! This is an early work for Merchant Ivory (1979),but the seeds of some of their greatness that was to come is very much present in THE EUROPEANS.The attention to detail is very much a hallmark of Merchant Ivory films,no matter how you may feel about their massive body of works. Some of the finest cinematography and colour ever can be found in the Merchant Ivory films. That alone is a rare treat for some. However,the choice of actors,apart from Lee Remick,was very B-list and lower... and it shows. Also,Henry James' novels have always seemed to be problematic for both the producers and viewers alike. The film is ,I hate to say, boring,but still it is a good representaion of American High Society if that is of interest. Other films that cover similar ground would be THE AGE OF INNOCENCE,THE HOUSE OF MIRTH,and THE BOSTONIANS (which is also a later Merchant Ivory movie

A rebellious girl, Gertrude, is ready to bust out of her staid existence.  Suddenly, her cousins arrive from Europe in somewhat mysterious circumstances, and their conservative, very protestant world is shaken.  As a result, there is some reshuffling of relationships, though what is going on with the older cousin, who is getting a divorce from a supposed Count in Germany, is never very clear, though I couldn't be bothered to try to piece together why.

The first time I saw it, I thought it was very beautiful (with the pristine historic New England houses and vivid autumn foliage, who could not?), but the pace did seem slow.  Dialogue and emotions are dealt with sparingly.  There is a lot of open space, visually and aurally.

After watching it again, and again, I became aware of details, nuances and textures in the writing and the acting that stood out more and more and filled those spaces with meaning and feeling. It is more a book coming to life than an adaptation of a book to another medium. It has become one of our favorites among the Merchant Ivory productions, and has a place on our all time best movie list as well.

All the acting is superb. Even a viewer less than enamored of Henry James would have to love Lee Remick's subtle and endearing portrayal of the beautiful, charming, possibly decadent (in the minds of the New Englanders), European cousin. Lisa Eichhorn as her opposite number, the repressed American cousin full of romantic longings, is equally affecting.",1357603200,2,1219,4.6465116279069765
