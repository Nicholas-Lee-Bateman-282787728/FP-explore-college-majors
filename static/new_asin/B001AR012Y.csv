8278856,3,B001AR012Y,"Forrest Griffin and Quinton Jackson are coming off their stint on coaching The Ultimate Fighter Season 7.  Jackson previously said he would bet his purse that their fight would not go to a decision, while Forrest's new style after being KO'd from Jardine is a stick and move style where he tends to outpoint people.  Whose style is successful?  Purchase to find out.

Ultimately many of the fights on this card were a tad disappointing, but still entertaining if you are an MMA fan.  Definitely a more technical event than electrifying action.  Depending on what type of fan you are and what fighters you like is what you should take in mind in considering this purchase.",1237248000,,671,4.741379310344827
8278857,4,B001AR012Y,"This was a pretty good event, but I gave it 4 stars because almost every other event this year has been better. 4/5 of the main card fights went to the score cards which doesnt make for too many surprises. This is a 2 disc set so it will probably feature the weigh ins/UFC.com featureettes/Behind the Scenes, and either the Countdown show or a behind the scenes look at the main event.

Still a lot of excitement in the main event which features defending world champion Rampage Jackson against Forrest Griffin(coming off his biggest win against Shogun Rua). I don't know why but something just seemed to be missing from this fight. First 2 rounds were exciting but the last 3 seemed like a totally different fight. Still an excellent fight though for Griffin.

Also, Josh Koscheck faces Chris Lytle. Nothing really to gain with this fight for Koscheck who was coming off a win over Dustin Hazelett. This is like a warm up fight for him if he faces George St Pierre again. Really bloody fight though as Koscheck executes some brutal ground and pound. Fight takes a round to get started but its alright from there.

Other fights that were okay but not great include Ricardo Almeida vs Patrick Cote, Tyson Griffin vs Marcus Aurelio, and Joe Stevenson vs Gleison Tibau.

Preliminary fights include:
Lightweight bout:  Jorge Gurgel vs.  Cole Miller
Lightweight bout:  Melvin Guillard vs.  Dennis Siver
Lightweight bout:  Corey Hill vs.  Justin Buchholz
Heavyweight bout:  Gabriel Gonzaga vs.  Justin McCully",1224806400,2,1503,4.874015748031496
8278858,5,B001AR012Y,"Are you kidding me , Overall the event was decent, it wasn't as good as 87 or anything, rampage is my favorite fighter, i jus didn't see him getting screwed, the fight i saw was kinda boring but got very intense at moments, yes forrest caught rampage with a nasty leg kick that hurt, thats about all i say, thank god forrest had a good chin cause he got a haymaker that almost ended this fight, i jus don't think that forrest went out there and beat rampage, i do give forrest respect but i will never agree with the decision,

Like i said some of the other fights were good but nothing amazing, i went to this event specifically for rampage wooping dat @ss,  i left this event unhappy, but it is because rampage is my favorite fighter, idk its up to you to decide",1224720000,3,764,4.226027397260274
