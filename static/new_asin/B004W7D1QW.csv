8444581,2,B004W7D1QW,"An OK DVD but the problem I had with it was the examples weren't very inspiring.  More of rote learning but melodically, not too much.  I was hoping for some cool sweeps to learn from this and it won't happen.  Maybe, you can put together your own or get them elsewhere after learning but if it doesn't appeal to me melodically, I have a terrible time learning and remembering,  I think they could have done much better at putting together examples that sound cool to practice.",1462752000,,477,4.511627906976744
