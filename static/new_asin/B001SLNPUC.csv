8340009,5,B001SLNPUC,"An interesting story about an American journalist who uses familial connections to arrange an interview with Latin America's most successful ""narcotraficante.""  Mistakenly thinking it's the opportunity of a lifetime, this journalist plunges - quite naively - into the belly of a gritty Mexican underworld.

While the story was intriguing, the movie's real standouts are its villains - Angel Santana and his cartel cronies.  As the story unfolds, the film teaches 13 ""principles"" behind this infamous drug lord's success.  The irony is that they also apply to all of us, providing the film's underlying ""moral"" - if you stick to your principles and adhere to your values, things tend to go well (although not always perfectly).  And if you don't?  Well, watch the movie and you'll see.

Kudos are also warranted for the film's cinematography (some of the shots are simply breathtaking).  If only all low-budget indie films had this much thought and production value.",1242864000,8,965,5.220779220779221
