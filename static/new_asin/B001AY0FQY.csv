3473334,5,B001AY0FQY,This is available at Borders for only $4.99. I seen it while waiting in line at checkout. Get it there instantly for cheaper! Funny DVD!,1273881600,2,136,4.48
3473335,5,B001AY0FQY,if your a big fan of game shows even dating back to black & white to the present it's full of laughs & something i would enjoy watching on dvd over & over again,1264982400,,160,3.735294117647059
3473336,5,B001AY0FQY,"This set includes five shows on a single disc, not two discs as stated on the cover. Shows from the 50s are covered as well as more recent shows. Ben Stein talks in a monotone voice, but that's just how he talks. This has to be one of the best game show blooper collections ever put out. A good collection for almost anyone to have, especially game show fans.",1255910400,7,359,4.217391304347826
3473337,5,B001AY0FQY,"I just adore this disc, although the previous reviewer is right -- there's just one, not two.  Amazon, please fix the description.  As to Ben Stein, to me the problem isn't the amount of his talking (some of his parodies of game shows are a riot), but the fact that he mumbles so terribly that you have to wonder whether he's whacked out on something.  That said, anyone who loves the classic game shows will adore this disc, because it really does contain a whole lot of laugh-out-loud moments.  Such as the game show contestant who was asked ""Which 'o' is a growing plant or animal?"" and replied ""Orgasm.""",1234828800,4,607,4.541284403669724
3473338,5,B001AY0FQY,"This DVD includes five episodes of the show.  It's tons of fun.  My only criticism is that there is too much chatter from Ben Stein and not enough funny clips.

The price is excellent for such a great collection of clips.  Note that it is a single DVD, not 2 DVDs as stated in the product description.",1231113600,9,301,4.228070175438597
3473339,5,B001AY0FQY,"That ""Mr. Game Show"" guy is sure funny! Gee, I think we've heard him announce on the game shows before. I know who it is, but I'm not telling. Let's see if those that ""aren't in the loop"" know who it is!

This is a good show, even though I don't own the DVD, I saw it on GSN and VH1 originally.",1219708800,6,294,3.7419354838709675

3473363,2,B001AY0FQY,"Unfortunately, this DVD shows a lot of British game show garbage and very little of American game show bloopers or craziness.  Save your money and borrow it from your local library, if you must watch it.",1390348800,3,203,4.638888888888889
3473364,3,B001AY0FQY,"This collection is fairly good, but at some points they play clips that leave you thinking, ""Why did they think that was funny?""  It's good to see once but I don't know if its worth spending money for.",1382572800,2,201,4.2894736842105265

3473366,3,B001AY0FQY,I love Ben Stein and would watch anything he's be involved in. This sometimes hilarious DVD is pretty silly and gets old fast. Worth watching for the few gems included.,1379116800,,168,4.633333333333334
3473367,5,B001AY0FQY,"This is an absolutely fabulous and funny dvd.  We laughed and laughed the entire way through it.  We loved it so much, that we bought one as a gift for someone else.  I wish that they would make more dvds like this with lots of highlights from the funny moments of game shows.  Please make more dvds like this!!!!!!!

The product was in excellent condition(new).If you love bloopers and flub shows the way I do,this is a must to own. This was on television in the early 00s as a television program shown every so often. I love it then and it is great to be able to look at over and over again which I will.",1361232000,,365,4.013698630136986

3473381,4,B001AY0FQY,"I picked this DVD up last night at a Burlington Coat Factory of all places for $2.99. Today being a chilly, boring day I watched the whole thing back to back. I enjoyed seeing Ben Stein as the host, but some of what he said bordered on mumbling and I couldn't understand him. I did enjoy the games he played with the audience members, but the prizes were pathetic. Preparation H Wipes, really? Who would want that? I'd rather have a lame t-shirt or coffee mug than that. Most of the specials contained clips from the same shows and though I laughed out loud a few times, my favorite clips were from The Match Game, The Price is Right and the different incarnations of Family Feud, featuring everyone from the recently deceased Richard Dawson to Richard Karn as the hosts. It was also fun to spot game show regulars like Betty White, Bert Convy and others, however briefly they were shown. I had seen a few of these clips before, but many of them were ones I hadn't seen before and even the ones I had seen were amusing to me and worth seeing again. For the amount I paid for this set and the clips included, I was impressed with what I saw. I love classic game shows, with all of their crazy contestants, risque answers and horny old hosts (I'm looking at you, Richard Dawson and Gene Rayburn). Good stuff.",1356134400,3,1306,4.400826446280992
3473382,4,B001AY0FQY,This is a video for game show fans that would like to review a few good laughs and have them on the shelf for an occasional nostalgic trip. Cheap enough for a game show fan.,1352419200,,173,3.9714285714285715
3473383,2,B001AY0FQY,"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in this dvd. After the second episode, it became predictable and boring. The episodes just seem to drag on and on. I will not purchase anything similar to this dvd in the near future.",1351382400,,222,4.717948717948718
3473384,5,B001AY0FQY,This is a DVD of five episodes of shows that have bloopers that are very funny. They include Password The Price is Right Family Fued Press Your Luck Match Game Super Password and everything else you can think of. This is an enjoyable watch.,1346889600,2,240,4.4772727272727275
3473385,3,B001AY0FQY,"""Game Show Moments Gone Bananas"" was originally a series of clip shows, featuring odd and unusual moments from game shows, that aired on VH1 in 2005.  It was hosted by Ben Stein in front of a studio audience.  This DVD is a collection of all five of those shows.  I enjoyed the DVD and recommend it, but that having been said, I'd like to point out the parts I didn't like...

1) There's no scene selection.  Your only choices are shows 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  If there's a particularly funny game show moment you want to see again without having to sit through the entire show, you have to go to that show and fast-forward until you get to it.

2) The re-enactments of Beat The Clock, Family Feud and other game shows with members of the audience was a waste of time that could have been used to show more clips.  Besides, I wonder just how legitimate the re-creation of Family Feud with the audience member is, anyway.

3) The biggest pain-in-the-butt on the DVD, by far and away, is the GSN promo at the beginning.  You can't skip it, and you can't fast-forward through it.  It's only about 45 seconds or so, but I don't need to spend that time watching people talk about how much they love GSN every time I want to watch this.  And, adding insult to injury, the last one testimonial is a person saying something to the effect of, ""Don't disturb my GSN time.  That's MY time.""  Well, GSN, YOU'RE disturbing MY time by making me watch that stupid promo!  Again, it's only 45 seconds or so, but that's MY 45 seconds or so.

These three things, particularly #3, are why I'm only giving this three stars.",1327881600,33,1597,4.344594594594595
3473386,1,B001AY0FQY,Worst DVD I've ever bought in my life. Seems that all DVDs about bloopers are just a big horrible joke. This one fits in just right. Dont buy or waste money.,1317168000,,157,4.096774193548387
3473387,3,B001AY0FQY,"Includes several clips of popular game shows, showing funny moments of bloopers, outrageous challenges and incredibly dumb answers. Hosted by Ben Stein.",1303430400,,152,5.954545454545454
3473388,1,B001AY0FQY,"Although I enjoyed this DVD very much, I gave it a low rating because unbeknownst to me it's the exact same one I ordered earlier this year!  I ordered this one because of the 2008 year, mine is 2010. Although I expected a few of the shows to be the same as mine I didn't expect the exact same DVD with a different label.  The only benefit to my wasting my money on something I already have is that I can give this one to my best friend as an additional Christmas gift.",1289433600,3,469,4.032258064516129
3473389,4,B001AY0FQY,"Having seen more than half of these shows when the originally aired and loved the old formats of those classic Game Shows - this 'clip'/'highlight' type show has a lot to offer.

There are 8 segments (episodes) on this DVD and it is a collection of the TV Show that originally aired in syndication with host Ben Stein.

Ben does a great dead pan delivery of the intros for some of the funniest moments on Game Shows. From The Dating Game, Password, The Price Is Right, Family Fued, What's My Line, The Newlywed Game and many more. He also hosts small segments of his own version of games from 'Beat The Clock' that have hysterical prizes for the winners. (And they are REAL prizes too!)

Sprinkled throughout are guest appearances by various celebrities (past and present) with the various TOP TEN lists of funniest bloopers, flubs and show flaws.

For the price this DVD is defiantely worth it. There are no notable special features - but you will find yourself laughing outloud. Take this one home with you!  6-8-10",1275955200,15,1017,4.659217877094972
