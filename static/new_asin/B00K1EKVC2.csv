6398349,2,B00K1EKVC2,"I noticed the word ""erratic"" in an above review.  If you loved IE in The Wire where he was intelligent, thoughtful, loyal, but compassionate and  violent in one carefully packaged performance, you'll get none of that in this ultraperverse, erratic series.  Had this series come first, then The Wire, you'd be amazed; as it is, Luther is several notches below that one.  And IE is cliched as in Marlowe, Sam Spade, Harper, Jake Gittes, etc.  His lumbering John Wayne walk; his inspired, intuitive leaps to fantastically correct conclusions; his erratic outbursts all out of proportion to the moment; his ""meet cute"" blonde girlfriend in L3; and the array of deranged pychos he encounters (definitely not from the London Visitors Bureau) point towards a detective who should be searching for writers, not killers.  However, he's the Associate Producer--so there you go.  Some of the bizarre situations are gripping if not totally implausible; and not since Hannibal Lecter romanced agent Starling, has there been as nutty a Fatal Attraction as between Luther and his literal femme fatale Alice Morgan as played deftly by Ruth Wilson with the oddly-curled upper lip. I watched them all, so I can hardly say don't; but if London was filled with as much disgustingly strange, random violence (even for cable)--and I mean sickeningly violent--it would have the holiday allure of Mogadishu and a population of about 17.  Mr. Elba is still a big handsome hunk, ladies, so curl up and enjoy; but if you're looking for a great lead performance and worthy storylines, this ain't it.  For diehards, yes; for fans of The Wire, The Sopranos, even Dexter, wait til it's $ 1.98.",1419897600,5,1662,4.992753623188406

6398356,5,B00K1EKVC2,"The English really know how to create good theatre. The writing, acting, and directing in this series is second to none. This series is mesmerizing, engrossing, and extremely well acted. The relationship between Luther and Alice Morgan (the hippest, most beautiful psycho killer chick of all time) is so endearing - you have this psychotic cold blooded killer who is in love with a very dysfunctional and yet brilliant cop. Through their interactions and life circumstances, they have come to trust one another implicitly, and act as one another ""Guardian Angel"". If I could give this series 10 out of 5 stars, I would.

Rumored to be on short lists to succeed the current James Bond---Elba has a great big screen presence. Some hard to understand British dialogue until you get used to the flow---and typical good production values and supporting cast. A little depressing to binge-watch as I did---but very worthwhile.

6398370,5,B00K1EKVC2,"Idris Elba, known to many as Stringer Bell from HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire/dp/B00RUTUPYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire</a>, stars as John Luther, an English detective with a huge problem.  Luther is on the verge of a total breakdown.  His world is coming apart at the seams both personally and mentally.  His marriage to his wife, Zoe [(Indira Varma) (Suzie from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchwood/dp/B0050UEVJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchwood</a>)].  Because of this his work suffers.

To say Luther is a dark series would be accurate.  Elba's ability to pull it off without looking as though he's merely trying to convince you he's lost it is a testament to great acting.  Those expecting to see Stringer Bell will be sorely disappointed.  This is Luther plain and simple.",1450483200,,898,6.681034482758621

6398378,5,B00K1EKVC2,"There just has to be more to come. The final episode leaves the door open for continued development of this engaging mini-series. My captivation with ""Luther"" began with the first episode and continued all the way to the series finale. This series has more stories to tell either in continuing the mini-series on BBCA or a feature length movie. ""Luther"" is crime drama at its best the British way. A strong performance by Idris Elba as a detective blurring the lines of legally carrying out his duties. I couldn't help but have flashbacks of him playing a drug kingpin with noble intentions in another mini-series on a well known American premium cable channel. He also commanded your full attention in that role also. However, there is much more to ""Luther"" with a great supporting cast of actors and actresses in meaningful roles with several plot twists and turns.

6398384,5,B00K1EKVC2,"Last month (January 2015), I watched a funny segment of a cable news program after the President's State of the Union address.  Chris Matthews, a 69 year old American political commentator and news anchor for his weeknight talk show HARDBALL on MSNBC, attempted a celebrity interview a la Larry King.  Matthews was interviewing British actress Ruth Wilson, who just received a Golden Globe for best television actress (drama) for her role in Showtime's THE AFFAIR.  Wilson answered some pertinent questions about the role of women in television drama series, but demurred when Matthews asked her to ""talk American.""

Well, Ruth Wilson, I haven't seen Showtime's THE AFFAIR but you were stupendous in the BBC drama serial LUTHER.

  LUTHER may be the first drama serial that I binge-watched by renting the DVDs - two at a time from Netflix. This British psychological crime television series stars Idris Elba as the title character, Detective Chief Inspector John Luther.  The first series of six episodes was initially broadcast on BBC One in May and early June 2010. A second and third season with only four episodes each were broadcast in consecutive summers. The series was broadcast for America viewers on BBC America beginning in October 2010.

  The plots are dramatizations of John Luther's cases for the Serious and Serial Crime Unit in London, England. He is often consumed by the darkness of the crimes with which he deals and is often hampered by his interactions with the women in his life: his ex-wife Zoe, his police superior, and Alice Morgan, his nemesis.  He is unable to arrest Alice Morgan, the murderer in the first episode, and for the rest of the series she becomes his confidante, giving him insight into the motivations of other criminals. British actress Ruth Wilson plays the red-lipped and beautiful red-haired Alice.

  The series has received eight Primetime Emmy Award nominations.  Elba was nominated for a Golden Globe for all three seasons as best actor in a television drama; he won for the second season of LUTHER. He also won the 2014 NAACP Image Award as best television actor (drama).

  In November 2014 BBC announced that it would air a two episode miniseries of LUTHER in 2015.  Hopefully, it will be aired on BBC America.  Meanwhile, I'm trying to squeeze some $$ from my Social Security check to purchase this excellent collection.",1423612800,6,2374,4.989821882951654
6398385,5,B00K1EKVC2,"Excellent show from the folks at BBC.  Idris Elba ('Stringer' Bell from the wire) is magnificent as Luther, a genius detective with a passion of justice and a tendency toward violence.  Definitely worth the watch.",1421712000,,213,5.057142857142857

Each season is made up of an overall story and two or more cases, murder being the crime Luther works.
Season one is six shows, season two and three is four shows each making about 14 hours total time.
The acting is excellent; most of the stories are compelling making for a gritty and realistic drama.
This is BBC TV, they speak English not American, some of the accents are hard to follow and words can have different meanings.
