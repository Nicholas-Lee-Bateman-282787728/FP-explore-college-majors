8378505,5,B0001DCYD2,"This was one of the first anime shows I ever watched (disregarding of course the televised Speed Racer, Rainbow Bright, and the like in the early 80s) and the first I fell in love with.  I was floored when AnimEigo picked it up to distribute and so happy with the result in the subbing and packaging.

However, I do have to say that I am not pleased with the price.  It was 2 years ago that I picked up the entire TV series DVD box set for $50 from a Japanese vendor.  The show is amazing and trend setting for such series as Rumiko Takahashi's ""Ranma Nibun No Ichi"" and Ken's ""Love Hina.""  The story sucks you in so emotionally like in  .  But with only 3 episodes per disc, I feel cheated by the company that brought me so much joy back in the early 90s.

Do not negate this show, it is amazing and breath taking and very emotional.

If you like drama/romance anime, look in to these as well:  Marmalade Boy, Love Love?, To Heart-remember my memories-, Kanon, First Kiss Story, and there are tons more.  Hope you do get to see K.O.R. though, it's extremely memorable.",1103587200,,1069,4.295
