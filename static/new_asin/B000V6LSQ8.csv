  ... thus do we reward the unjust""

This is one of the finest horror films
I have seen in a long time.
It is terrifying and heartbreaking.

The musical score and cinematography are brilliant.
The use of color, and shadow are masterful.
The acting is excellent.

The tension is so great that the quite tame
scary parts are nearly unbearable.

Some of the imagery is horrific.
[spoiler]
(ex: the now 3 year old spirit-girl
dragging a bloody fetus
through a nether-worldly cemetery
and singing a song of how her mother
once loved her, then tossing
the bloody fetus on a pile of dirt!!!)

I know that I am experiencing a great horror film
when I need to take a rest period at some point
and then return to it.
I did that with ""The Exorcist"" and ""Suspiria""
and I had to do that with this film.

Unfortunately, like so many horror films,
the ending seems like an afterthought.
Very disappointing.
I wish the film makers put as much thought
and creativity into the ending as they had
the rest of the film.

This film will get neither the recognition,
nor the distribution it deserves given
the theme and the politics of abortion
in the mainstream film industry.
Too bad.
Thank you to Pathfinder Pictures
for making this film available on DVD.

This is a must-see not-to-be-missed film
for the fan of gothic horror.
