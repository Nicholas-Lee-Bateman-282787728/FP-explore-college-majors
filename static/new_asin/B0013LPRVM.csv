8252218,1,B0013LPRVM,AMAZON advertises that this movie is in BLACK & WHITE as well as COLOR. I purchased it on 02/13/2009 and returned it the same day. It is in FUZZY BLACK & WHITE O N L Y! It DOES come in a display tin [which is in color!]. I think that where they got the idea that it is COLORIZED! Perhaps someone at AMAZON should physically check out the movies that they advertise rather than take the word of new suppliers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1240099200,10,422,4.2875
