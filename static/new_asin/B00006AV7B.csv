7966681,3,B00006AV7B,"It is an American television movie based on real events, starring Kate Jackson, known for his role in Charlie's Angels actress, a TV series popular in the late 70s. The theme of the film is quite interesting (the slow realization of a mother about her son), but also formal screenplay treatment is so clumsy that the main subject is not treated. In the end, the film appears rather as a praise of denunciation. Formerly, in Stalin's USSR, the authorities stood statues children denouncing their parents. In the conformist America today, we actually telefilms. It is true that the son is a lackluster character.",1387324800,,610,4.932038834951456
