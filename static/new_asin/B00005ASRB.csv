7935669,1,B00005ASRB,"This is seemingly a poorly guided tour of a 2nd rate Irish farming museum.  Broken down old implements (like churns and primitive washing machines, often with missing parts, are poorly demonstrated in fairly poor visual quality.  You'll search in vain for lovely Irish thatched roofs or folk art or other interesting things.  If you like looking at cracked china, though, this might be just the film for you.  By the way, it is not even close to the 60 minutes long it claims to be.  I found this to be merciful.",1024099200,2,512,4.582417582417582
7935670,2,B00005ASRB,"I knew that this wasn't going to be an 'edge of your seat' type of video, but even I was surprised at the slow pace and dubious production values. You REALLY have to love Ireland to appreciate this video and for most, the glimpses of the lovely Irish countryside and the soft Irish accents won't be enough to counter the 'watching paint dry' affect. If you're interested in agricultural machinery/rural existence this video MAY be for you.
It might give you some ideas, even! But it is plodding, and is not a sophisticated production by any means. I don't feel cheated, and it is educational in its way. But I probably would not have purchased if I had had a preview. Recommended to farmers and wool-spinners.",1019520000,,709,4.634920634920635
