8055176,2,B00080Z76E,"This anime is mediocre. Animation is poorly drawn. Adaptation from manga to anime poor. Anime is totally watered down and ""Kiddiefied"". The way the story ends is lame.

I own the Manga and the live action television series of Boys Over Flowers. They are SUPERIOR to this Anime adaptation. I LOVE the Manga, the storytelling is touching and humorous. The live action series of Boys Over Flowers is equally spellbinding.",1169510400,,418,4.9714285714285715
8055177,4,B00080Z76E,"This was the most exciting anime ever when i saw the first one i was wanting more. I only gave this a four star because the ending was too easy to guess and i wanted more than just that. It was just all sooooo funny and i was just so into the movie. I had to replay some scenes and re-laugh at them, but i really wish there were more to this anime...",1150156800,2,350,3.808219178082192

The ending was different than the manga, but that happens in anime. A lot of factors determine how long a series runs on TV. How the series ended in print format isn't a huge concern to TV.

Movies change books we love, all the time. At least after all the trials and tribulations, true love won in this one. You're not sure what happens in the manga.

Overall, this DVD provided a wrap-up for a series that was so wonderful I can't find another anime to compare to it. I love it that much. The final episode took us back to the first, with many of the same themes replaying...but making clear what all had changed since then.

Pet peeves: I saw the entire series in fan-sub, then saw the DVD version. It bothers me how the subtitlers on the DVDs have the characters referring to each other with their first names all the time, when the audio clearly demonstrates that they do NOT. It jarred me, every single time to hear ""Makino!"" and see ""Tsukushi!""

When I first saw this anime (vol. 1...ah, memories!), I thought the animation was kinda boring. Now I realize how bright and crisp it is.

And the humor--! Very few of the episodes don't have a rib-clutching scene in it: Makino putting her shoe to Doumyoji's face to open (and close!) the series, Makino blowing on her fist to warm it up for Doumyoji's face, the F4 pretending Doumyoji had died, as a practical joke on Makino...who promptly starts strangling him for scaring her that way! I don't advocate that kind of behavior in real life, but it's amazingly funny here. Just like Road Runner cartoons are funny (to me, anyway).

As for the rest of the series...

This is one of the most wonderful stories ever, about friendship, loyalty, betrayal, forgiveness, being true to yourself, looking past exteriors to the person within, and the real meaning of love--all the important things in this life. It addresses serious issues like hazing and class differences with sensitivity.

Every character in Hana Yori Dango is real, someone you know or have known or met or loved or hated. It has one of the greatest female characters ever created. Makino Tsukushi isn't perfect. But I wouldn't want her to be.

I cannot recommend this series highly enough.",1144454400,9,2225,4.653061224489796
8055179,3,B00080Z76E,"I can only give this disk 3 stars.  The series, which became my guilty addiction, ended so abruptly, and so unconvincingly.  And is it really over?  What about all the characters I have come to know and love?  (Where is the movie?  They made one in Japan...although I heard it wasn't too good)

I don't really want to say too much, to give out any spoilers.  But what I guess it comes down to is this...if you are a Boys over Flowers fan, you will definitely want to watch the anime conclusion.  And if you haven't started reading the manga yet, this disc may just give you the jump start you needed...so the ending won't be so abrupt (I'm assuming...as of now, they have only released 15 volumes out of the 36 Japanese volume series)",1136419200,2,734,4.385185185185185
8055180,3,B00080Z76E,"Although the last episodes of the anime are very good, it seems to abrupt and I never thought it would end this way. In the manga, the ending is just around volume 18 of the manga and there are a complete of 36 volumes. So, the ending is very different from the manga and I think that the ending left you in question of ""is that it?"" while the manga, gives the time you need to see how the two main characters fell in love and the ending is so much more better. Its so much more wholesome and didn't leave you hanging. Of course, the animation is lovely although the storyline turned from the manga and seems a bit weird. But it's good never the less, just read the manga though if your a big fan of HYD.",1124323200,2,704,4.071942446043166
8055181,5,B00080Z76E,I received my dvd in 2 days.  It was the final dvd of an anime series and I bought it right away from amazon.  It was cheaper than the vendors on amazon marketplace and came in swiftly.  I was happy and have to thank amazon for being able to see the last episodes of this series so soon after it came out.  I would give them more than five stars if I could.,1123459200,,357,3.8493150684931505
8055182,4,B00080Z76E,"It is a pity, that the Ending story is not romantic for hana yori dango fan(otaku).Everything are overturming....It is the total opposite of the amazing with the Beginning .

My feeling is lacking something...tears?",1116806400,2,215,5.323529411764706
