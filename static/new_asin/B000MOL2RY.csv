8211702,5,B000MOL2RY,i found this vhs tape in the late 1980's at a pharmacy department store and i still have it. i was a happy camper because i do have this steve roach cd based on this tape. incredible photography and music. it's like hand and glove. it is worth buying on vhs or dvd.,1247443200,,265,4.018867924528302
