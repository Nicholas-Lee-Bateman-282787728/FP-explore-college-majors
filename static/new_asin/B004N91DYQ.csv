Special effects are excellent!

I thought I would be disappointed when Nick Cutter was no longer apart of ARC (Series 3), but the storylines kept the pace and drama of the Series 1 & 2. It continues in this Series (4). If you enjoyed the previous episodes, you will enjoy this.",1301443200,5,356,4.546875

8436529,1,B004N91DYQ,"I did not notice that the format was for UK-- never heard of that before so when it came in , I opened it to use it and it wouldn't play.  Then I noted it was the wrong format but because it was opened I was unable to return it.  It came timely but I think the add should have been more obvious that it was for UK and would not work in the US",1390089600,,342,3.546666666666667

8436532,4,B004N91DYQ,"Score another one for my region-free DVD player. I get to keep on watching one of the best sci-fi shows currently on television, that good PRIMEVAL from across the pond. I couldn't wait until Series 4 came out on Region 1, what with Series 3 having left the audience in a lurch and rumors floating about that the show had been axed. If you recall, the curtain dropped on Series 3 with three of the core characters marooned in the distant prehistoric past, seemingly with no hope of escape. I was pretty gutted, desolate that the show was over and with no resolution. And then word came down the pipe that there would be a series 4 afer all, to the tune of seven eps. Boisterous was the rejoicing in my household, much pizza digested, Diet Coke ingested, tons of Tums doled out. Good times.

For Abby and Connor, one harrowing year would elapse in the Cretaceous period before they manage to find their way back to present-day England, and I have to dis Connor's game for his not having made much headway in the ""romancing Abby"" department during that span of togetherness, although it does confirm his creds as a hapless nerd. Things have moved on whilst Abby and Connor were away, the ARC team having at last given them up for dead after futile multiple rescue attempts. A new Anomaly Research Centre has been erected, now funded by conniving billionaire entrepreneur Philip Burton (Alexander Siddig). Part of the fun of Series 4 lies in watching Burton and the ARC's supercilious director, James Lester (the awesome Ben Miller), engage in those politely venomous power plays. But it's clear that Burton is up to something rather nefarious, especially when he hints to Connor - whom he's taken under his wing - of a special project called New Dawn. A recurring annoyance surfaces in that, throughout the series, Connor seems blind to Burton's shadiness.

Abby and Connor are introduced to new field team leader, the Scotsman Matt Anderson (Ciarn McMenamin) and to Jess Parker (Ruth Kearney), who operates the Hub, the hi-tech information center from which she interprets and passes on data to the field operatives. Captain Becker (Ben Mansfield) is still around and the writers must've finally warmed up to him because his character gets developed some.

It'll take a villain with major chops to fill in the void vacated by the insane Helen Cutter, who finally got her just desserts in the Series 3 finale. We meet 19th century time travelers, Ethan and Emily, in episode 3. It's a story that opens with a closed opera theater being haunted by a creepy reptilian presence only, this time, it isn't a critic but a Tree Creeper, this frightening arboreal raptor. The ARC team learns that one of these two displaced persons is a murderer. As the series goes on, the team also learns that this person seems exceedingly familiar with the 21st century.

Are you surprised that several characters are nursing hidden agendas? No? One of these sneaky cats is the ARC's field leader, Matt Anderson. Others are the 19th century transplants, and, of course, Philip Burton. The biggest disappointment in all this secret-keeping is that it turns out that the projected Big Bad's ulterior motivation turns out to be fairly ridiculous, and this undermines the episodes this character is in. To make up for it, the real threat, when it does surface, is indeed very daunting. It even ties into Matt's reveal.

Temporal anomalies acknowledge no boundaries. The ARC team is deployed to diverse locales, ranging from that opera theater to an abandoned penitentiary to the docks to a high school. The prehistoric creatures emerging from the time anomalies are as equally motley in nature and they look so good, thanks to some stunning CG work. A giant dinosaur Spinosaurus, a boar crocodile, the watery Labyrinthodont, a pack of lupine Hyaenodons, the Terror Birds... one wonders why Abby is so adamant about saving these predators that are so savage even Rubeus Hagrid wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet in them. Just once, couldn't a cute koala bear wander thru an anomaly?

For those into reunions, episode 6 features the ARC team investigating an anomaly in a stately manor in which Jenny Lewis (lovely Lucy Brown) is about to get married. And if you thought they'd forgotten about Danny Quinn...

Series 4 is very good, although it suffers from a rather nondescript performance by Ciarn McMenamin whose ""Matt Anderson"" is subdued as tofu. This is never more obvious as when the lively Danny Quinn finally does turn up. I do wish the episodes had focused even more on Abby and Connor's interactions, as they are my two favorite characters in the show. Again, I'm questioning Connor's game. Progress with his Abby project is moving at a glacial pace. But I guess it's cool. Hannah Spearritt and Andrew-Lee Potts still demonstrate that good chemistry. The ARC team is still fighting the good fight. PRIMEVAL still lives.

Bonus stuff consists of the featurette ""New Dawn: Making the new PRIMEVAL"" (00:21:18 minutes long).",1312675200,,5001,4.875294117647059
8436533,5,B004N91DYQ,"Come on, why is this last series not formatted for the U.S. and Canada? I've watched this show from day one, suffered through Cutter's death and cliffhangers and then the show going off the air, but now it's back and I want this fourth season. All I can say is, keep on bringing it on. Love, love, love Abby and Conner and the whole cast. Top notch actors, especially, Hannah and Andrew, but honestly, the entire cast is superb, as well as the creatures. I'm tapping my fingers waiting for season five and this fourth season to be available to us poor Americans! Bring on more Primeval!",1307836800,2,586,4.485981308411215
8436534,5,B004N91DYQ,This is a really fun series from Great Britain.  Found it just by accident and am totally addicted.  Love the characters and the theme.  Just be aware if you continue with the series you get the dvd's compatible with American machines.  Some are only formatted for British DVD players.,1307059200,,285,4.755102040816326
