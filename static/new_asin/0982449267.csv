174377,5,0982449267,"Like his other videos, Jeff Primack's new Strength Training DVD translates the Eastern wisdom of Qigong into a modern context. Immediately noteworthy is the fact that the unique Qigong breathing techniques he reveals make it possible to achieve 100 (or more) pushups in a workout almost from the beginning. (It worked for me yesterday at one of his workshops, and I'm 63 years old!) A number of simple exercises on the DVD show you how to generate a deep sweat and enable a full-body workout with no equipment other than a yoga mat.",1348444800,,532,4.731182795698925

Glad I attended his seminar before, so that I was able to press on the chi, which is what I believed helped me through.  That, and Jeff's encouraging, slightly comical comments along the way.  I have a long journey ahead to 100 pushups, but when I make it, I'm sure it will have all been worth it!",1403481600,,428,4.182926829268292

I enJoy this different method of workout compaired to other types of work out videos, switching from intense motion to resting postures helps muscles recover in between.  The ""Journey to 100 pushups"" is invigorating to say the least...  Good quality animation. Easy to follow. Will see results quickly. :)",1382832000,,369,5.43859649122807

7795092,2,0982449267,"There is no qigong secret here to build strength.  In fact, this DVD has very little to do with qigong.  It is mostly calisthenics.  You'd have to be extremely strong to keep up with this guy, in which case, you'd already know how to do pushups.

I did like the warriors nine breaths, but that doesn't make this video worth the $45.",1352332800,3,332,4.306451612903226
