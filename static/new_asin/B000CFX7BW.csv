He went on to take the world by storm and this wonderful DVD allowed me to catch up with what those old seeds had sewn... I would have given the DVD's 6 stars if it had come with a coupon for a bottle of Bile Beer...",1355097600,3,381,3.8974358974358974

8098836,5,B000CFX7BW,"Ok if your a fan of any sort of Freak Show this is for you. You get to hop aboard the Jim Rose Circus as they travel and actually get to know the people as they are aside from performing. You have Lefto thats all around nice. Jim as an overly nice person yet if need be can be a dick.

Check it out it was very good. I loved it. Its got alot of rewatchablility",1175299200,9,360,3.736842105263158
