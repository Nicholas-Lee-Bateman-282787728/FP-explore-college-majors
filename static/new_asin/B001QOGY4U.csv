3768065,3,B001QOGY4U,"""If I were your wedding, I'd be sleeping with one eye open...""

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. BFFs Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson) dream of their dream weddings at the Plaza Hotel
2. This is the one thing that Emma has ever wanted
3. Liv always gets everything she wants
4. Oops! Both weddings get booked for the same day
5. Open warfare commences
6. For most of the movie
7. Bit over the top if you ask me
8. ... but funny anyway

This is a straight up chick flick, made watchable by Hathaway and Hudson.  If I lost you at ""chick flick"", I apologize, but this is exactly what this is.

The sabotage scenarios are mostly funny, albeit highly improbable, but this is a good movie to rent for an afternoon giggle with the girls, over wine, cheese and chocolate.

Warning: Forcing menfolk to watch this may constitute grounds for divorce in some countries.

3.5 stars

3768066,5,B001QOGY4U,I loved this movie I seen it twice. I have been waiting for it to come out I am glad that it is almost time how exciting me and one of my friends were just talking about it the other day.........,1237248000,,195,3.7804878048780486
3768067,1,B001QOGY4U,"What I am trying to say is that Anne Hathaway is a likeable actress. She does not compare with Meryl Streep or Kate Winslet, Emma Thomson, Sean Penn, Robert Denero, Kristen Scott Thomas, Anthony Hopkins, Kevin Kline, Loura Linney, Ingrid Bergman, Daniel Day Lewis, Judi Dench, Ralf Fiens, Alan Arkin etc. I'm not saying she's the worst actress in the world, but she is decent and likable.

HOLLYWOOD TODAY:  READ It's important that Americans need to be AWARE of these notes.

 I'm just saying that Hollywood is getting these good looking people to star in their movies. The next generation of people coming up are going to ruin the acting business because look at all these model actresses. They can't act worth a penny!!! It's the truth. Look at the comedies being made now a days and all these action thrillers that don`t show one`s acting ability. The comedies are being made for idiots like the movies, Clueless, He's just not in to you, confessions of a Shopahollic, Bridewars, fired up, etc. Now older movies like 70's and 80's were good. EXCELLENT. You know why? There actors were awesome and they all had a GOOD STORY, but today it is rare to find a good story in the Cinemas. They didn't worry about what you looked like back then. To tell you the truth, European movies are much better than American movies today. There child actors and adult actors are better and there are more of them over seas. They get better acting TRAINING. They have good stories. There comedies are better. Though Angelina Jolie is a superb actress and has good looks. Films are being filmed how society is like. Technology is advancing and treatments to look good is posted everywhere.

BACK TO ANNE HATHAWAY

 Now Meryl Streep, Helen Mirren, Cate Blanchett, Glen Close, Holy Hunter all have a qwurky look. They are not necassarily the model type. Anne Hathaway has a gorgeous look, but is not an outstanding actress. Sure, she cried in a few scenes, but it wasn't the real emotion, it was fake. Anne Hathaway is a likable PERSON AND ACTRESS like Drew Barrymore, Jennafer Anderson, Kristen Stewart, etc. She doesn't have the realness in her eyes. She doesn't have any qwarkes that make her stand out which is something like PRESENCE an actor should always have. You either have it or you don't. Like singing too. You have to stand out, its being Believable and you have to be interesting and of course great! She is also a monatone actress. I am 14 years old and I know what I am talking about. Please respond to this paragraph because I would like to know what you think.

Thank you for reading. I do have to say the director is very good. That's a plus. : )",1236902400,3,2647,4.6050955414012735
3768068,5,B001QOGY4U,"As I've said before, I rarely watch chick flicks, I'm a guy that's more into horror and comedy, but on some occasions, I watch movies like these. I thought the plot was very good, and very funny! Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson were awesome together, and they are both extremely sexy! Liv and Emma have been best friends for 20 years, and they soon become engaged. They were going to be each other Maid of Honor, but there was an accident and there weddings are going to be on the same day and neither of them won't move their wedding to a different date. Soon, they start fighting with each other, including blue hair, dark tans, and weight gain. I highly recommend BRIDE WARS!!!",1236211200,3,678,4.475806451612903
3768069,4,B001QOGY4U,"Chick-flick entertainment served up in multi-tiered wedding cake with extra frosting.

Those of you who loved The Wedding Planner, girlfriend adventure flicks, revenge films, 27 Dresses and the whole idea of weddings should love every second of this mostly clean, mostly entertaining movie. Emma and Liv are best friends until a wedding date at THE Plaza interferes. Then it's gloves off, head gear on, underground cat fight. Several laugh out loud moments and a few teary ones are included for your overall viewing pleasure.

The non-family friendly aspects...both couples live together and are shown in bed, though clothed and talking. A male dance club is the scene of a dance off that is risque but not gross. Drinking happens. One character spews a substitute for the F-bomb, and innuendo and a few colorful words are dropped into the dialog and plot.

Positive messages... people change and grow. True friends are hard to come by and are worth more than a sugar and spice dream.
Communication is a great way to handle disagreements. Revenge doesn't feel as good as it seems like it might.

Annoying elements....few plot lines are predictable, another one is not developed. Some character changes aren't believable.

Overall, I'm giving it 4 stars because it is charming and delivers exactly what it promises.",1232236800,2,1314,5.093023255813954
3768070,3,B001QOGY4U,"We ended up seeing ""Bride Wars"" because we ended up at the wrong theater (hey, it is a 50/50 shot in the Zenith City) and it was the next movie starting (we had already paid for parking and popcorn by the time we discovered our--okay MY--mistake).  It seemed a good proposition given the likeability of the two stars,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kate-Hudson/dp/B00003CXMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kate Hudson</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-Hathaway/dp/B000J103PC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne Hathaway</a>.  Hudson is Liv, an up and coming cut-throat lawyer, and Hathaway is Emma, a most compliant middle school teacher.  Since they were little girls they have dreamed of having June weddings at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.  Then the stars align and both become engaged, at which point they immediately book a joint appointment Marion St. Claire (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candice-Bergen/dp/B0006N2EZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candice Bergen</a>), the queen of wedding planners.  Then the stars look down and laugh, and suddenly it looks like only one of them is going to get the wedding of her dreams.  Or maybe both of them will end up with wedding nightmares.

I would say that the situation in ""Bride Wars"" is contrived, but having also watched ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swing-Vote/dp/B001ILFUBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swing Vote</a>"" this week, it seems a gross injustice to lump the two films together in that particular pile.  But the problem here is not with the premise, but rather with its execution.  The screenplay by Greg DePaul, Casey Wilson and June Diane Raphael comes up with enough comic elements off of the situation, but the movie never evinces any ambition beyond being something to be played at bachelorette parties for the next couple of years.  There should be more of a balance for our sympathies in this movie between Liv and Emma, but there simply is not and even after setting up the idea of an earnest and heartfelt reconciliation between the two best friends, the script says, no, we are going ahead with the two brides wrestling in their wedding gowns because, hey, we already put it in the trailer.

The script also requires the friends and families of these two to get out of the way, and while I might be able to accept this on the part of the pair's few gal pals who appear in the film, I find it impossible to believe with regards to Liv's brother (Bryan Greenberg) and Emma's father (John Pankow).  They would both want to attend both weddings and either one of them should have shown up and locked the two women in a room together until they came to their senses.  Then again, you know going into this one that it is a chick flick and therefore should not be surprised that the male characters are ultimately inconsequential.  Even an appropriately romantic proposal is assurance of nothing in this movie. Finally, when we get to the big lesson at the end you have to be skeptical because it is something these two women should have figured out a long time ago if they really were best friends.  But the only thing in the movie that makes you think that they are is the fact the script makes them say the words from time to time, without ever backing it up with heartfelt actions.  I do not want a movie to act like it has heart; I want it to actually have one.

""Bride Wars"" is certainly true to its title, because it is predominantly about the efforts of these two best friends to sabotage the other one's wedding (or, more specifically, their preparations for that supposedly happiest of days).  You would think that if Liv and Emma had been planning their weddings since they were little girls that the end products would be more interesting.  But then if realism were any sort of concern here then we would be wondering how poor little Emma can afford a June wedding at the Plaza.  Beyond that, it must be said that all of the best scenes in the film are Hathaway's, and she is so good that even with the grossest of manipulations the look in her big eyes and the quaver in her voice will still bring a tear or two to your eyes.  Just as there is no question as to which of the two characters is the most sympathetic, neither is that any doubt as to which of these two actresses is going to be the bigger&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/star/dp/B0013BV1XA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">star</a>, despite this middling little misstep.",1232064000,16,4630,5.263586956521739
3768071,4,B001QOGY4U,"Bride Wars hit theatres January 9 but already it proves to be a cute, well written film with potential to grace chick-flick must have lists. The brides: Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson). Everyone knows an Emma, the girl who is easily walked on and is always aiming to please everyone, even at her own expense. And of course everyone knows a Liv, the no nonsense girl who gets what she wants. The two naturally click as polar oppossites. And this chemistry doesn't end in the script. Hudson and Hathaway not only portray perfect examples of there characters personalities but also mesh perfectly when they are sharing the screen. Emma and Liv are lifetime best buds, who both become engaged within days of each other. They schedule to meet with a wedding planner played by Candice Bergen to plan their respective weddings since both want a June wedding at an exclusive New York hotel. But when the weddings get booked on the same day, the brides to be take off the gloves and with the help of some orange spray tan, blue hair dye, and a spring break video they began the hilarious road to sabotage and ultimately testing the strength of their friendship.",1231718400,3,1163,4.678048780487805
3768072,5,B001QOGY4U,"Whoever said blood was thicker than water? Liv and Emma truely prove this with their bond that is established, tested and strengthened throughout a funny, real, and heartfelt movie. The nice part is that the trailers give away some of the funny parts but the heart of the movie is seen in the flipped-upside-down ending that will leave you teary-eyed but give you that feeling of rightness. This is the way it should be. The other nice thing is that the focus is on the two friends- not necessary cluttered with confusing and bland subplots. *Girls- make it a movie-night tonight with your best friends and go see this movie!",1231459200,3,625,4.6909090909090905
3768073,2,B001QOGY4U,"If you're looking for a comedy with weird plot twists and a sprinkling of humor, then you'll still be searching - Bride Wars excels at the former and sadly fails at the latter. It's not entirely silly sabotage and witless laughs as a few scenes and characters do stand out of the clich wedding comedy crowd, but ultimately the tragic outcomes and easy clean-up of a far too messy situation will leave viewers wishing for a more comfortably predictable plotline.

Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since childhood and both have always dreamed of a gorgeous June wedding at the luxurious Plaza Hotel. When both girls' boyfriends ask for their hands in marriage, Liv and Emma enlist the highly reputable wedding planner Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen) to acquire their dream locale. Unfortunately a clerical error has their weddings set on the same day and thus begins a rivalry of increasingly ruthless sabotage as both girls refuse to reschedule their most important day.

No experimentation or originality can be seen in Bride Wars. Everything is terribly formulaic, from the music-narrated montages to the carefully patterned dialogue to the high points and low points for each of the heroines. When a half-expected love triangle forms, it is completely unnecessary and sorely mislaid - this is the kind of film where each event is better off contributing solely to comedy and every sad moment is best coated with ridiculous gags and off-the-wall mood-shifting resolutions. Touches of seriousness have no place in Bride Wars, which struggles so greatly with its adult dilemmas that the moments of humor feel forced - shoved into the cracks to even out the heartbreak most won't be feeling for these cookie-cutter characters.

If it wasn't bad enough that no individuality finds its way through all the girl-oriented giggling, hormonal wedding craze and subdued cat-fighting, the humor itself is oftentimes indecipherable from the drama. Sometimes it's funny to see these girls bitterly attack one another even if we're meant to sympathize, and other times it's disheartening when we're supposed to be laughing. Either way, so little of the film sparks interest or concern over two hopelessly contrived, generic best friends that it would be as wasteful to debate over them as it was to spoil two hours of valuable time watching the film. Hopefully even the target audience will realize the recycled, uninspired nature of Bride Wars.

3768877,2,B001QOGY4U,"Liv and Emma are best friends who since childhood have planned every detail of their respective weddings. But a clerical error led to them to complicated events in this romantic comedy that stars Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway entitled,Bride Wars.

Liv and Emma have planned everything for their respective weddings from their ""must have"" list that includes like the New York's ultimate bridal destination and the Plaza Hotel. They are both 26 years old and are scheduled to get married to live happily ever after. But a clerical error causes a clash in wedding dates instead as both are to be married in the same date. Liv, a successful lawyer who is used to getting what she wants, including the perfect job and the perfect man, won't settle for anything less than the perfect wedding she has dreamed of for years. As for Emma, a schoolteacher who has always been good at taking care of others, but not so much in looking after herself, discovers her inner ""Bridezilla"" and comes out swinging when her own dream wedding is imperiled. Now, the two best friends who'd do anything for each other, find themselves in a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners struggle that threatens to erupt into all-out wedding war.

Too bad that both Hudson and Hathaway does not provide anything worthwhile nor memorable in this vehicle except catfights that barely elicits any laughter nor humor. It was basically bland,unimaginative and lacks creativity. But anyone who loves a chic flick will surely enjoy this movie especially fans of the lead actresses and those who love bridal gowns and wedding dresses.",1425254400,,1589,4.992452830188679

A story of friendship, self doubt, dreams that do and don't come true, priorities, relationships. I don't cry over movies. This one made me cry. It reminded me that under all the stereotypes in life, there are real people, with feelings and depth and insecurities and surprising strengths.

It was sort of saddening to see this very comical yet true portrayal of what marriage has become today.  I wouldn't want my daughters picking up this idea, so it won't be a movie my children ever watch, nor will I be giving much of a second-go.

For those who don't share my sentiments, there is only mild vulgarity and innuendo.  I wouldn't consider the actresses to be impeccably modest, but they aren't as bad as usual in most modern movies.",1353715200,,551,4.372549019607843

3769198,2,B001QOGY4U,"Anyone with half a brain knows that all the wedding planner had to do was call the last woman she'd scheduled and told her that she'd penciled her down for the wrong date, switched it, and the Emma and Liv didn't have to even be bothered by the mistake that hadn't been their fault at all. If you're paying someone thousands of dollars (we'll assume that's what they paid Bergman's character) to plan your wedding and they can't even get the date right and they're haggling you over it, then you need to go somewhere else. Furthermore, if I'm working for someone and I accidentally put in the wrong dates, why wouldn't I simply go back into the computer once I've figured out the mistake and just correct it?!  That's all any of them had to friggin do!!!

This is just supposed to be a cute brainless movie about friendship and love with a pretty backdrop, but I thought the premise would've made a lot more sense than it did. It's like the writers just didn't bother to figure out anything more creative other than that and it sucks. The rest of the movie is entertaining at least, but I just couldn't get that little fact out of my head the entire time that there's no way something like that would happen in real life.",1336176000,2,1221,4.4222222222222225
3769199,3,B001QOGY4U,"There was such a mistake in the beginning of the movie. The wedding planner saw Emma and Liv before she saw the third girl. When she found out about the unavailability of dates, she should have gone to the third girl to make HER change her date. The whole controversy never should have happened.

But anyway, then we wouldn't have had a movie. And they needed the third girl so Emma and Liv could chase her through the department store and make a ruckus. It's just that it would have made a lot more sense if that girl hadn't been THIRD!

I enjoyed this movie; I did. It was pretty funny. It's just that I found it disturbing too. It's hard to imagine ""best friends"" being so cruel to each other. Anne Hathaway's character in particular went overboard with her practical jokes. One can easily understand the frustration her fiance had for her as well... and not feel much sympathy when he gets angry with her! It just seemed lame when she accused him of being in love with the person she was 10 years ago, not the person she is now. Well, the person she is now is mean!",1332806400,,1069,4.34

I do agree it is an original idea and does give esp the males out there the sheer intensity of how important this occasion is for women, and also to a certain extent why women may make good friends but the worst of enemies.

Overall I give it a 3 on 5 due to a lot of predictability and clichs but I did like the chemistry of the 2 leads stars, the others characters seemed rather bland in fact entirely devoid of personality.

One day Liv and Emma both get engaged (almost simultaneously), so they both rush to the city's most famous wedding planner Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen). Marion accepts the job; their weddings are booked; it is their childhood dream come true.

But the dream turns a nightmare when they discover that the receptionist at Marion's office made a mistake. This means both weddings are booked on the same day. Liv and Emma fall out over the conflicting schedule, and (I don't know why, but) instead of having a double wedding, the girls start doing outrageous antics to ruin the other's wedding plans.

Probably whether or not there are really such people who attempt to sabotage their lifelong friend's wedding ceremony is not relevant. The story doesn't convince me anyway and I still don't understand why the two unmemorable grooms are attracted to the annoying girls in the first place. These weaknesses, however, could have been forgotten had the film been fun to watch. Sorry, it is not.

""Bride Wars"" is directed by Gary Winick, who did a much better job in ""13 Going on 30"" and ""Charlotte's Web."" Here he is determined to play it safe, never going for any hard-hitting jokes or originality when he has a chance. I know this is not a dark comedy like ""The War of the Roses."" Still, what those bickering girls do to each other simply do not deserve the name of ""war"" as they are just clich&eacute;d, recycled jokes seen somewhere else.

Their jealousy and drama about the Plaza, the dresses, the parties, etc. was so far-fetched that I couldn't relate.

No matter what else was going on in their lives, no other accomplishments matter because they were still single.

It's an unfortunately true stereotype of a lot of women, and the wedding industry seeks to reinforce it at every turn.  And yes, the movie does sort of poke fun at it, but not enough.  In the end it wasn't enough to shake the foul taste of 'you must be married to be worthy' out of my mouth (which, yes, is odd, since I am married and have been for 12 years, so I'm a 'complete women' in their eyes...).

In the end it just wasn't funny enough, wasn't zany enough, wasn't original enough to be great.

The by-the-numbers screenplay by Greg DePaul, June Diane Raphael, and former SNL regular Casey Wilson could have been a sharp satire on the excesses of wedding-related commerce or a black comedy about competitiveness among the superficially entitled, either approach of which I would have praised. Sadly, it's neither, and as limply directed by Gary Winick (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/13-Going-on-30/dp/B000CEV3KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">13 Going on 30</a>), it seems targeted squarely to privileged pre-adolescent girls because the two principals reflect the obsessive, childish mindset of that age. Their emotional immaturity and sitcom-level behavior become draining.

This contemporary parable focuses on childhood best pals Liv and Emma, which of course in this movie's simplistic terms, means they are opposites in every possible way. Liv is the wealthy, ber-ambitious lawyer and naturally the less sympathetic one, while Emma is a doormat struggling to make ends meet as a middle-school teacher. To meet the plot's dimensions, it is Liv who has the perfect boyfriend, all understanding and patience, while Emma has a live-in boyfriend who apparently has issues with her budding emancipation. Waiting in the wings is Liv's brother who is made to look so ideal that the screenplay might as well telegraph the resolution. The plot turns on a consultation with Manhattan's leading wedding planner Marion St. Clare, whose administrative assistant erroneously double-booked Liv's and Emma's wedding on the same June day at the Plaza Hotel. The rest of the movie is about how they one-up each other with fraternity-level pranks until the inevitable conclusion.

Kate Hudson (who also co-executive produced) seems to becoming a worse actress with every movie, as she plays almost every scene as Liv with the subtlety of a mime artist. I don't recognize any of the talent she showcased as free-spirit groupie Penny Lane in Cameron Crowe's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Almost-Famous/dp/B00005OM4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Almost Famous</a>&nbsp;nearly a decade ago.

Emma and Liv are shallow and mean and I found it difficult to like either of them.  The acting in this film was nothing special, but then the script was so weak, I could not see how anyone could produce a really 'good' performance.  This movie was torturous to watch with no laughs and a predictable ending that I saw coming very early in the film.

I actually loved this movie. It has a ""once apoun a time"" element that frames the story, and its light and funny.  The story is silly but still relatable. I noticed some of the reviews critique the movie because the women seem ""dumb"" for how they react to potentially sharing a wedding date. It's a comedy! The movie isn't set up to be all about bride-zillas, its about two friends who have shared everything for 20 years and then... this happens... and an innocous mistake snowballs into... well, that's the movie!

It also has TERRIBLE supporting actors, an average script and really poor characterization. Unlike the 4 dimensional characters in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" ""27 Dresses"" or ""The Holiday"" these characters are flat, predictable and unnatural. Even Anne Hathaway (who I love in most films) seemed flat out awkward and strange portraying her character (Watch the school hall scene towards the beginning and tell me she is not TOTALLY uncomfortable.)

So, all in all, this film has several sweet moments and a few great laughs... it's far from perfect (or even above average) but I recommend one viewing. That should be enough.",1245974400,2,721,5.008333333333334

But that isn't the audience this must have wanted.  It wanted the vacuous girl who has decided a wedding is more important then anything else she might enjoy in her life.  That graduating college, having a baby (oh could this be the sequel) was the pinnacle of it all.

When there is a mix up with their wedding planner and the weddings are booked on the same day instead of coming up with a solution of a duel ceremony, or even some slight staggering it is better to destroy the other's wedding with not so funny hi jinx.  I would tell you the ending but you can guess it unless you have never seen an American film and were hoping for a Hamlet like conclusion.

The reason for the stars I did give it is at least the humor is clean.  It at least decided not to resort to bathroom humor in an effort for a few nervous giggles.  Anne Hathaway does ""act"" and can't be all bad in anything she does.  Kate Hudson is not as good, but not dreadful.

They needed a lot more character development of the supporting rolls. Especially since I really like most of the supporting actors (like Candice Bergen and the gal from 3rd rock) and I was looking forward to seeing them in this flick. We barely see any of the fianc&eacute;s in the movie, only enough to get that one is supportive and loving and the other is a controlling selfish jerk.
There wasn't nearly enough wedding shopping. Like they only tried on one dress and bought it. I would have liked to see a bunch of dresses. Not to mention both dresses were UGLY.
During the whole movie I really didn't understand what all the fighting was about and it wasn't explained well at all. They both got to have their weddings at the Plaza but in different rooms at the same time. I would of said ""no big deal"" and chosen another maid of honor, so I don't understand why they made such a fuss.

3769466,4,B001QOGY4U,"Simply said, Bride Wars is not a movie in contention for academy awards.  It isn't a movie that goes to extreme attempts to be realistic or especially on the ending note, plausible.  However, I found it to be a funny movie that gave me atleast four to five burst out laughing moments and I give this movie credit for that.
When Marilyn St. Clair, portrayed endearingly by Candice Bergan, revealed to Hudson's and Hathaway's characters that there was an error and both women's wedddings were scheduled on the same day, at that point one has to make the decision look at the movie critically or accept it as the comedy it is.  I see why some women would be upset given the feminist viewpoint, but bottom line, two women are friends, have a falling out and go to outrageous lengths to make each other suffer, but make up at the end. Is that so bad??
What I found most intriguing was the chemistry between Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway.  They seemed as actresses very comfortable with each other and that came across in their characters, especially in the first third where their long term friendship was portrayed.
I didn't find the women's feud that unrealistic to be honest.  I've had many female friends all of my life and I've seen situations set the feuds and rivalries going.  Luckily, I witnessed the apologies and hugs as comes not unexpectedly at the end of this movie.
My only complaint is the very ending note was a bit contrived and it's like, ok, this REALLY stretches reality, but I see they had to end it somehow. I'm liable to watch the friendship reignited towards the very end, then hit the DVD remote chapter button to the end credits to skip the ending note.
Otherwise, I saw this movie on Cable On Demand and I plan to purchase the DVD as soon as I can.  I'm glad others enjoyed the movie too. :)",1241913600,,1814,4.495440729483283

The movie could've been better had it:
-More thoroughly offered insight into Anne Hathaway's relationship as well as Kate Hudson's brother's character--and their rapport
-Created more drama and suspense with pranks between the girls (more stunts that weren't immediately destructive)
-Offered more in terms of character development for all those included in the cast

The film needed more comedy and less cut-throat. But Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway are still charming, adorable and fun to watch but the film lacked the true depth. All and all it reminded me of Miss Congeniality with Sandra Bullock--lovely leading ladie(s) but not much to work with and lots of pointless pratfalls.",1241913600,,888,5.427536231884058

3769484,3,B001QOGY4U,"I'll admit it; I actually really wanted to see this movie.  Sure, it wasn't at the top of my `must see' list, but I have this inhuman infatuation with Anne Hathaway and I've always found Kate Hudson to be as dreamy (and as funny) as her mother Goldie and so I was going to see this movie regardless of how `mixed' the reviews were.

So, after seeing it I can say this; while the film is nothing new and completely predictable it is still fun and entertaining.

The film revolves around `best friends since childhood' Liv and Emma.  When they were little they attended a wedding with their mothers at the Plaza Hotel and were so awestruck they made it their lifelong dream to be married (in June) at the Plaza.  When Liv and Emma wind up getting engaged in the same week with a little over three months until June they both make appointments with wedding planner Marion St. Claire and book their June weddings; Liv's on June 6th and Emma's on June 27th.  When a mix up in the scheduling department gives another bride Emma's date and moves her to the same date as Liv their presents itself a dilemma.  Unless they want a double wedding (which is not an option) one of them will have to change dates, which means changing venues, thus crushing the lifelong dream of a Plaza wedding.

Neither girl wants to budge; thus we experience `Bride Wars'.

The pairing of Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway seems inspired, and for the most part it is.  They both have a good chemistry with one another (they make believable friends) and they both have very good comedic timing (Hathaway's is slightly more polished).  Oh yeah, and they are both above and beyond gorgeous.  Here's the thing though, both of these actresses are better than what is asked of them here.  They have both been in `throw away' comedies before, but the material here is almost less than that.  Look at what Hudson did with `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' or what Hathaway did with both the `Princess Diary' movies and even last years `Get Smart'.  They are both better that this.  I would have loves to see these two Oscar nominated actresses really sink their teeth into a smart comedy (ala `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or even something like `Juno') or better yet, have them work together on an intense dramady.  `Bride Wars' is generic at best and feels very recycled from just about every other generic `chick flick' comedy out there.

There is nothing inspiring here.

The `war' here is mild really, nothing truly outrageous (and it is true that what you see in the trailer is basically what you get in the film).  The ending is something you can see from a mile away and the character development is pretty standard.  I also was NOT a fan of the narrative that ran through (it was far too sappy for the film).  The acting is all good though, no complaints there.  Even when the characters are as clichd as they come they are still funny.  Hudson and Hathaway are both very good here (again, Hathaway is slightly better), and the supporting cast, especially Candice Bergen and Kristen Johnston, are funny and engaging.  So in the end I can't say I'd recommend this movie or see it again, but I'm glad I did see it once and if it comes on TV or whatnot go ahead and watch it.  It's entertaining, even if it is generic.",1241136000,,3290,4.487394957983193

I never thought I would see the day I did not like Kate Hudson in a film. Her acting was ridiculous. I think she raided her mom's fashion closet for the stupid 1960's Laugh In hair style and the racoon eye make up. She looked like a clown and the movie matched.",1240876800,5,552,4.349514563106796

8336141,4,B001QOGY4U,"This film surprised me with Kate Hudson (Liv) and Anne Hathaway (Emma) as best friends throughout their entire lives who become bitter rivals when it comes to a wedding mixup. It's not just any snafu, but one they cannot bend on as each young woman has an equal stake in it. The hijinx, shenanigans, and vitriol begin, and it gets very polarized and vicious, as it goes from bad to worse before their weddings are ready for the march down the aisle.

What came as such a surprise is the way they were able to smooth over some of the rough edges of a love they ultimately had through time. They had been dear to each other since they were very young children and that trips them up as adversaries while turning the film from altogether ruthlessness to an understanding of how much each position hurt the other and how much it triggered them further into the mud. Needless to say, it was difficult to take a side and not just the viewer, but, their friends too. They each feel justified as the other gets more vicious but are they more hurt by the behavior or seriously wishing the other harm?

I found this film a truthful look into best friends - and all that entails - along with just how willing (or not entirely) they will go to thwart the other's wedding along with all of the festive things ahead of that day and all that leads up to it. All in all, a fun, but not too deep, film that you may like for these best friends who never leave the other in their logic nor will not stop keeping their best interests in mind...even if you may not see it at first.",1527897600,,1560,4.284745762711864
