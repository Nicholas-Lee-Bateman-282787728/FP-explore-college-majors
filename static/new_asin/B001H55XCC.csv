8307841,5,B001H55XCC,"This is the most romantic, friendship story I have ever watched in years.
The only thing is, I bought the Korean virsion of the dvd and they again censored the whore movie and put the mozaic on the picture like boy's shower scene, when the boy showing a naked woman's photo, they put the mosaic again in her hair to block showing her hair.
It was so anoying and I was so angry about it, I had to just buy this dvd again from Amazon Uk right away after watching this movie. The movie was that good. I wanted to have a perfect movie.

The story is about this Jewish boy who falls in love with a famous pianist who is also Jew.
She was so famous that he couldn't go closer.
But in somehow he did.
But she was married to a wealthy man already although she was not all happy it seems.

Then it becomes that Nazi came to the land and it becomes caos.

But the boy worked so hard to be a violinist and he made it to the top.
There is his wealthy friend who is also a violinist and it happens to be that there is a competition going on and there are two boys left at the end that are him and his wealthy friend. What a tregidy.
But knowing all that, his friend secretly give up by stop playing the tune in the middle of the competition.

He finally had a chance to play with the lady he have been yearning for years.
Find out everything, his effort, love toward her, done everyting to play instrument with her, they finally make brief love right before the concert at the waiting room.
That might have been in heaven to this man.
It was such a brief moment for us too but ENNIO MORRICONE'S great music and all, the shot was superb to watch.
I am not talking about eroticism. It was true art iteslf. The love scene.

Then the play.
What they play. They played as if it is the end of the world.
It sure was. The Nazi were there to capture them all to put them all in the camp all right.
They played to the end.
Nothing mattered.
The world, the water, the audiences, the nature, the air, the money, the evrything they suffered to come here, the everything they will face from now on, the everything they have been through, they all won't be matter just for this moment.

Then the moment.

There is this girl meets this man at the auction to buy this violin.
The old man happens to win the auction and buys the violin and the girl is not all pleased. It seems that this particular violin seems a lot to her. It is priceless.
This girl happens to be the daughter of the man who is the violin player and we can see that the mother was the pianist who also was in the camp and died there.
So who is the old man who actually bought the violin winning the auction?
We found out that this man is the friend of the violin player.
When it was a rainny day, and another soldiers came to the land which is Russian this time, the man gave the violin to this girl at last.
The girl was so much sturred.
Later she meets this man again and he grabs her hand. He was like a father to her although initially she thought that he is her father for a short time after meeting this man who knew both her father and her father's friend.

This movie is so touching because it is a story about a man who is dedicated to a woman all his life, and a story of a man and his friend's friendship all their life, and a great music by Ennio Morricone a great artist of our life.

We are blessed that we can be able to watch this kind of movie and it is sad that this kind of movie is not that popular after all.",1464998400,,3469,4.045189504373178
