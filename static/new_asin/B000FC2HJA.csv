8120718,3,B000FC2HJA,"I had no idea Munch was Norwegian.  I guess I can now mention his name alongside that of Ibsen.  The U in his name is pronounced like the ""oo"" in ""cool.""  Further, his name ends with an ""-nk"" sound, rather than an English ""-ch"" sound.

The work says Munch spent time in France, Germany, and Denmark, but it never says if Munch could speak anything besides Norwegian.  When you see Russian art, you see lots of heavy coats and fur hats.  Supposedly, Norway is really cold and often dark, but that doesn't seem to get portrayed in Munch's work.  It said he and other family members dealt with depression.  Again, I wonder if the cold, dark Norwegian environment gave him seasonal depression disorder.

The work says as Munch's life became happier, so did his art, and people then championed it less.  I would hate for modern artists to take that info and say, ""See this is why I should stay drunk or high, or not get therapy:  it improves my art.""  Though Munch had girlfriends, he never married.  The work said he had a ""complicated"" view of women, but I wonder if some of his views were just plain-old misogyny.

The work doesn't have any Norwegian interviewees or foreign language subtitles.  They blur reenactments and this helps to make them look less cheesy.",1194652800,2,1262,4.596412556053812
