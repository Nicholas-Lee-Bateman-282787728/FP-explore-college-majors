8657852,4,B000I0QMW2,"This is an outstanding film! I learned about the history of the Montauk Lighthouse, the years preceding its erection, and those following. The film chronicles the impact of the lighthouse on the waterways near Long Island and the people who depend on the sea for their livelihoods. I most enjoyed the portrayal of those individuals. As an educator, I value the depth of historical significance, and the simplicity of the filmaker's message. I highly recommend this film!",1192579200,2,470,5.116883116883117
