It begins with a woman attacking a man! Her wig falls off. She takes the $75 coming to her, and her wig. She applies her make-up and leaves. The year is 1961. Next its 1963, people wait at a bus station. A woman steps off the bus, men watch her. She sells champagne, $10 a bottle. She hooks up with the cop. He tells her to get out of town; go across the river to Candys salon. I never make change she says. Kelly stares at the mirror. She finds a pleasant room for rent. Griff stops at Candys Salon. Kelly learns about this towns founder and benefactor. Kelly works at the hospital with crippled children. Griff argues with her about her new job; she is trying to change. Grant meets Miss Kelly and gives her an antique glass bottle from Venice. He shows her movies of Venice, taken from a gondola. Another nurse wants a new job.

Kelly offers a gown to Buff. Later Buff tells Kelly she got $25 from Candys Salon. Kelly warns her about that life. Kelly visits Candys Salon to talk to her and tell her to stay away from Buff. Kelly tells Grant about her past. But he wants to marry her. [Is this credible?] She agrees. Kelly offer help and advice to Dusty. Griff meets Kelly, they talk in private. He gives her 30 minutes to get out of town, but Kelly calls Grant. Later Grant has a confession for Kelly. She reacts by hitting him! [This may explain his actions.] There is shocking news. Griff questions Kelly about her actions. Griff brings in Kellys former procurer and Kelly explains what happened then. Later Dusty talks to Griff about Kellys help. Finally that young girl Dusty is found. Will she talk to Kelly? Yes. A court can dismiss an action, and does for Kelly. So Kelly leaves town on the bus.

This is a lower budget exploitation movie that must have been shocking for its time. Is the story believable? Could such a situation exist in a small city? Could a strange woman get a job as a nurse in a hospital? I don't think so. Religion is a big factor in small town life but is missing here.",1488844800,,2030,4.322834645669292
