7921002,3,B00004RFGK,"The original Sol Bianca was an arguably entertaining story about a smugglers ship crewed entirely by women, and a stowaway with issues. Now it seems the ship has been rediscovered by antique enthusiasts with a passion for Spanish. Fans of Armitage will find Hiroyuki Ochi's style familiar. The ambitious all CG animation is unique but not fully matured. Pans in particular are jarring and you just can't get over the feeling that it looks wrong some how. Some unique effects don't really outweigh the sense of unease created by the animation. The story might get better later but I don't think I can sit through the next 2 DVDs to find out.",1015200000,2,640,4.723214285714286
7921003,5,B00004RFGK,"This series is da bomb!  Unfortunently the bomb's about as big as a cherry bomb.  Talk about short!  3 whole volumns with 2 episodes each.  sheesh.  Why did they even bother.  I love the show.  Terrific story, great graphics.  It left me wanting more!  Just when you think after watching this first episode that you're in for a long ride of swashbuckling adventure, think again.",1013126400,,378,4.6923076923076925
7921004,4,B00004RFGK,"Sol Bianca originally came to us from two OVAs (Original Video Animations) in the early 90s.  These two stories told of a Sol Bianca much further along in its history than is depicted in the current video releases, which pick up the story at least one and possibly many years earlier, when May was not yet a part of the crew (she joins in episode 1).  Yet, as fans of some of the best OVA series of a decade ago are discovering as these stories are remade into new modern OVA series, there are often many points of story and character redesign, in many ways a retelling of the story in a different way.  Whether the new Sol Bianca OVA series ever converges back with its original OVA heritage is a matter that may only be resolved as time goes by.

I'm quite surprised by the depths of storytelling in the new OVA series.  It is also very Japanese in that from the beginning of episode 1, it is clear that the whole story will not be revealed until many episodes have passed, if not until the end of the set.  One must watch, wait, absorb, and above all, think, in order to appreciate this series.

Episode 1: We are swept back into Sol Binaca's past (in comparison to the original OVAs) where the new OVA begins on a backwater left-behind former frontier world.  In the first three minutes a stiring montage of scenes from April's history roll out, setting the stage and placing the foundation for all the storylines.  This continues for all of them, in bits and pieces, hints and possibilities, droppped here and there.  The main plot is set up to introduce us to those who will obviously be the recurring villains of the series.  We are also introduced to some important world-building information not previously available that begins to explain a great many things.

Episode 2: The crew is off to a planet where treasure might be found, but the Blue Comets are hot on their heels.  We learn important new background information about the history of the setting and about June and about the history of the setting.

I felt my money was well spent here.",982454400,2,2055,4.504043126684636

7921006,4,B00004RFGK,"I bought this title without any knowledge of it, just because I trust Pioneer and AnimeonDVD.com. It's a fine film with great music and a promising story background (not much story happens on this first disc), you  must only look away from the sometimes very disturbing 3D effects and  Sancho.",958953600,,293,4.84
7921007,2,B00004RFGK,"Sol Bianca is a watchable little series about a crew of women and a stow-away young boy on a super-ship called the Sol Bianca.  The characters lack development, and what little their is becomes very cliche' .  The  hardcore, kill-em-all, short haired male hating woman was once a model that  got screwed over for some reason or other. The captain is a drunk, the  computer geek is a cyborg in secret and the stow-away is son to a rebel  leader.  As cookie-cutter as this movie may be, its worth a rent but not a  purchase.",957139200,,522,4.421052631578948
7921008,5,B00004RFGK,"Very good animation with just the right amount of CGI to make it look cool. Everything in this series seems to be stylish: characters, ships, backgrounds and technology. The plot lacks a bit in depth, but does not  hamper the enjoyment. Definitely worth to buy!",957052800,,261,4.8
