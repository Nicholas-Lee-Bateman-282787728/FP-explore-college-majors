My Spanish isn't that good, so I'm not sure if this movie is supposed to have anything to do with Johnston McCulley's original stories, which were the basis for the Zorro movies of Tyrone Power, Guy Williams and Antonio Banderas fame. I *think* this movie may be some kind of unauthorized knock-off, based on the fact that the hero wears a mask (although it's not the standard Domino-style one, like Robin wears, but a full-head bandana with eyeholes and markings), that he's a vigilante, etc. But I could be wrong about that. Still, the translated title of the film is, after all, ""Zorro the Avenger.""

Anyway, as was popular 10-20 years prior to this in Hollywood oaters starring the likes of Roy Rogers, this is a western with a singing cowboy hero, here portrayed by the 'Wild Rooster' himself, Luis Aguilar. Assuming that's him on the soundtrack (and I see no reason not to), he has quite a good voice, for sure. It's just that, well...having been brought up on a steady diet of the westerns of John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and their kin, singing cowboys have always seemed rather anomalous to me - like garlic-flavored ice cream. It's an acquired taste. Still, it does definitely add to the film's weirdness quotient.

Anyway, there's a group of baddies called 'La Hermandad del Escorpion,' who use bows and arrows (more weirdness!) to knock off their enemies. They also hang the hero's best buddy and kidnap his hot fiancee (played by the muy caliente Maria Eugenia San Martin). And, to add insult to injury, they impersonate Zorro with a 'bad' Zorro, who does crimes and gets the real Zorro blamed for them. Awww, bit*hes, it is on now!

Of course, all is resolved satisfactorily by the end of the film's brisk 79 minute running time, with the hero's fiancee lending an able hand, too. Of course the good guys win! Yayyyy!",1376092800,,1887,4.691842900302115
