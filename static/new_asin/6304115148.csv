7863027,5,6304115148,"At last I have a copy of this video ... and it is a good one! I taped this program originally when it aired on A & E back in 1996 and always said I wanted to get the ""real deal"". I found a slightly used one (4 tape VHS set) and it is almost like watching a DVD; the sound and picture quality are magnificent. I have always been an ocean liner fan from the time I was a little kid and, after twenty years of procrastinating, the little boy in me has been fulfilled.",1485820800,,464,3.84375
7863028,5,6304115148,I agree...this is the finest and most impeccable look at the glorious ocean liners to the films date.  Absolute fabulous job.  Fritz Weaver makes this a special and personal engagement!  Even more than 15 years after it's release I still enjoy watching.,1419465600,,253,4.976190476190476

7863030,5,6304115148,"This is one of the most comprehensive, entertaining and factual shows about ocean liners I have ever watched. I actually own this series, but one of my VHS tapes was eaten by an old VCR, so I had to purchase the series again. Well worth the price.",1368576000,,247,4.276595744680851

7863032,5,6304115148,I video taped this series in 1998 when it came out and watched it several times. The best ocean liner documentary ever.  I keep hoping it will some day be re-released on DVD since I no longer own a VCR. No other ship documentary can stand up to this one.,1302307200,,254,4.08
7863033,5,6304115148,"This programme was made during a time when A&E was still entertaining.  I won't waste time going into how A&E has turned, but I will simply hold ""Floating Palaces"" close to my heart as a memory of when A&E was truly about Arts and Entertainment.

The narrator, Fritz Weaver, was perfect for this 4 part series.  Parts 1&2 begin with a four day westbound crossing from Southampton on QE2, interspersed throughout with historical bits on the earliest paddle steamers, Titanic, and leading into WWI with Lusitania.  Parts 3&4 continue with an eastbound crossing from New York interspersed with WWII history on Queens Mary and Elizabeth, Normandie, and into the 50's with United States, then to the present with modern cruise ships.  Historians interviewed include William H. Miller, John Maxtone-Graham, Frank Braynard, along with various QE2 passengers and crew.

This is my favourite documentary ever.  The package design alone is beautiful, clever, and looks great on my shelf.  My second favourite now being ""The Liners"" only available in UK in PAL format region 2 DVD (positively criminal that it isn't in region 1 NTSC).  They are both great, but with marked differences and separate advantages/disadvantages.  The disadvantage of ""Floating Palaces"" is that it isn't on Blu-ray (another crime).

If you can get a very good copy of this on VHS, it's worth the trouble.  I had taped it from cable in '97, but had to have the best copy still available and was lucky enough to find one. I wish anyone ordering this as great a luck as I had.",1287446400,2,1539,4.899613899613899
7863034,5,6304115148,"My husband and I inherited this four tape video set and just now took time to view it. How glad we are that we did! The magnificence of these major ships which made crossings of the Atlantic is hard to believe. As far as documentary film making goes, this series makes one appreciate the times in which we live, seemingly so far removed from the days of major ocean liners of great luxury which came to be used as more than luxury transportation. They actually delivered the goods in immigrants and later troops for both WWI and WWII. The actual footage of work underway on the construction of the ships, of simple man power used to load them with coal and all the other necessaries for their consumption are absolutely fascinating. The miracle of their existence and how they were a vital part of warfare, both as carriers and as strategic devices for damaging one the foes of either Kaiser Wilhelm, Mussolini, or Hitler. In a world of modern cruise ships for a taste of the luxurious life, there can be no comparison with what was experienced by the rich and famous, the steerage and later tourist classes, or the military and later their war brides. We recommend this trip into history. You will be amazed and delighted with what you will learn.",1095465600,4,1248,4.6008968609865475
