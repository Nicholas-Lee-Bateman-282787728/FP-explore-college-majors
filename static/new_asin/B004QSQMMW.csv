4455374,5,B004QSQMMW,I sure love watching these videos.. and so does my grandson.  Once he starts watching . .he watches. and forgets about the games he was playing..,1356739200,,145,4.576923076923077
4455375,3,B004QSQMMW,"I liked the film okay; but, most of the creatures shown I've seen before and knew a bit about them. I guess I'm trying to say there wasn't a lot of new knowledge presented to me as I've seen other films I have which showed about the same in a little different presentation. Still, If you like watching informative films about the dinosaurs you probably would like this film a little better than I did.",1353369600,,401,4.36
4455376,4,B004QSQMMW,"I purchased this as a Father's Day gift.  Dad was delighted just to see the cover photo and very much enjoyed watching the CD.  He gives it a 4-star dinosaur rating.  Btw, I received it within 3 days of ordering, so I thank the seller for his immediate fulfillment!",1341964800,,265,4.36734693877551
4455377,5,B004QSQMMW,Great doc. 3 hours of Dinosaurs. Kids loved it!! CGI is nice. Describes how they lived. Hours of entertainment for any Dino fan!!!,1325462400,,130,4.695652173913044
4455378,5,B004QSQMMW,"This dvd has 3 shows in one. The first show has great UPDATED info on a couple dinos. Its great because the show is relatively new so the info is up to date.

Shows 3 and 4 are about carnivores that may not be known as much as tyrannosaurus rex, which is really cool and gives you insight on new dinosaurs that you may or may not know",1313107200,5,334,3.911764705882353
4455379,5,B004QSQMMW,"I've got most all of the better Dinosaur and fossil DVDs, including Walking with Dinosaurs and Jurassic Fight Club.  This one is right up there with the very best; they did a marvelous job with regard to making this one! The simulated dinosaurs are simply stunning; they are, often throughout the first of the three separate episodes of this DVD, breathtaking!  A lot of pertinent and interesting information is provided, with graphic images supporting the information given.  The first long episode is worth the price of the DVD, in and of itself.

  The first (and main) episode, which has the same title as the DVD itself, involves predators such as T-Rex and Deinonycus.  A lot of very interesting information is given on both of these dinosaurs; this episode is superb and is probably the best dinosaur-oriented film that I have ever seen thus far. T-rex and Deinonycus were both super-predators with large brains and with sensory systems that often surpassed our own. Various paleontologists give remarks throughout this episode, and their insights are interesting and fluid.  I like how Pete Larson, of the Black Hills Institute, while stating about how T-rex had expandable jaws (i.e., similar to that of snakes)... then mentions something like: ""There is not a lawyer around that would be too fat for a T-rex to swallow (whole)."" Pete, you got that right, alright!

  The second episode, entitled ""Monsters Resurrected: Great American Predator"", is about Acrocanthosaurus. Acrocanthosaurus is an awesome carnivore that left tracks, while going after a sauropod, in Texas; these tracks are analysed and explained as part of this segment.  The forearms of this predator were reconstructed in a real-life simulation experiment; what they do to the simulated prey material certainly leaves an impression!

  The third episode, entitled ""Beyond T-Rex"", is about Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus, two very cool carnivorous dinosaurs that surpassed T-Rex in size; very interesting information was provided here.  These two dinosaurs are closely related, due to the occurrence of land bridges that connected Africa and South America, after they split, millions of years ago.

  So, to sum it all up, if you don't like dinosaurs, be sure not to get this excellent DVD!",1309737600,35,2274,5.249307479224377

4455417,4,B004QSQMMW,My almost 4 year old loves Dinosaurs and really liked this movie!,1429401600,,65,4.5
4455418,4,B004QSQMMW,"This is a good documentary but as so many of them are, slightly too repetitive. Also I don't understand why Spinosaurus was not even considered nor any of these related dinosaurs. By general consensus of opinion this genus unquestionably produced larger predatory dinosaurs than any one mentioned in this documentary and surely by the time this video was made this genus was well known. Also Quetzalcoatlus is no longer considered to be the largest pterodactyl which ever lived and the estimated weights of the various animals mentioned need never to be taken very seriously as one paleontologist says one thing and another will give a different figure. One also can never take what paleontologists say about a dinosaur as gospel truth as one will say one thing and another will say something different but all in all I'd say this documentary is very entertaining as well as educational.",1426809600,,887,5.0

4455423,4,B004QSQMMW,"Very well done; graphics are great. Good information on dinosaurs. The only thing that keeps these documentaries from getting a five-star rating is their habit of recounting information. This might be a good thing when your broadcast is continually interrupted for long strings of commercials, but in a commercial-less DVD it is merely an irritating, boring, interruption.",1391644800,,372,5.543859649122807
4455424,4,B004QSQMMW,"I bought this as a Christmas present because my grandson's, aged 2 and 4, love dinosaurs.
