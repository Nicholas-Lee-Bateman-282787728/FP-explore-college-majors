Well this unique group of women brings comedy as can only happen by women. Sorry fellows you just need to be a woman willing to share as only women do in order to make this series flow,. It is difficult to maintain respect when acting how women manage life's struggles. The range in age is well chosen in order to turn up the chuckles. A great surprise. I took a chance when deciding to purchase this series, my good fortune. Buy it, you can only like it. JAM & JERUSALEM; get it and enjoy. P.J.Today",1263600000,,621,4.271186440677966
