4582495,3,B00561BNFY,"A very slight but enjoyable British romp from the 60's that cashes in on the then current James Bond mania. It stars the always excellent Dirk Bogarde and Robert Morley and  is a pleasent way to while away an 1 hour  and 30 mins even though I can barely remember any of the so-called plot. A pleasent time waster - nice to look at, with good locations and a good quality print too. No extras on the DVD  -but they are really  not needed!",1318204800,4,437,4.166666666666667

4582497,4,B00561BNFY,"VCI Entertainment and The Rank Collection presents ""AGENT 8 3/4"" (aka: Hot Enough For June) (1964) (97 min/Color) -- Starring: Dirk Bogarde, Sylva Koscina, Robert Morley, Leo McKern, Roger Delgado, John LeMesurier, Derek Fowlds, Amanda Grinling, Noel Harrison, Philo Hauser, John Junkin, Gertan Klauber

Directed by: Ralph Thomas

VCI has restored and brought from their vaults another great film from the British Invasion.

A nice combination of suspense adventure and romantic comedy.  A light comedic film that turned into a good suspense thriller by the end, there are many amusing moments to be had along the way.

Unemployed Czech-speaking writer Nicholas Whistler (Dirk Bogarde) thinks he's got a job visiting Prague for a bit of industrial espionage. In fact he is now in the employ of British Intelligence. His pretty chauffeurs on arrival behind the Iron Curtain, Comrade Vlasta Simonova (Sylva Koscina), is herself a Czech agent, the film is a combination between James Bond and 'North by Northwest'.

Well directed by Ralph Thomas, the film is carried by the superb and delicately delivered performances of those three old pros, Robert Morley, Leo McKern, and Dirk Bogarde.

And there is a wonderful 'in-joke'. At one point Bogarde is looking at a newspaper, and a secondary story which most people would not notice is headed: '""I'm not a spy!' says Ralph Thomas', Ralph Thomas of course being the film's director.

4582498,5,B00561BNFY,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agent-8-3-4/dp/B00561BNFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agent 8 3/4</a>&nbsp;I'm psyched about this comedy/thriller from 1964 finally being released on DVD. Dirk Bogarde plays an unemployed writer who inadvertantly gets caught up in international espionage. Released in Britain as HOT ENOUGH FOR JUNE, this delightful adventure has rarely played on TV ( I only saw it once on a PBS station back in the '70's) and I've been looking for it ever since. Hopefully we'll get a good widescreen transfer on the upcoming release!

Just as a postscript to this review, I recieved the DVD yesterday and watched it this evening. Let me tell you, this WIDESCREEN TRANSFER IS FLAWLESS ! Both in visual and audio, this print looks like it's BRAND NEW!!! The colors are GORGEOUS, the sound is CRYSTAL CLEAR and LOUD, so you don't have to crank up your audio. Frankly, I was floored - just amazed as the quality restoration they did on this film. And mind you, this is the regular DVD, so I imagine the BLU-RAY is astounding as well!",1311379200,13,1084,5.3023255813953485
8459001,4,B00561BNFY,"Could it have been better? Of course. But for something that was probably shot on a shoestring in the mid-60s when they were pumping out spy movies by the score, it's pretty darn good. Bonus: Rumpole of the Bailey stars as a very likeable bad guy! Horribly dated now, but if you can think back to a time when Q was still trying to come up with his first gadget for Bond, it's all charmingly low-tech.",1470787200,,400,4.276315789473684

8459004,5,B00561BNFY,Brilliant thank you,1421884800,,19,5.666666666666667
8459005,3,B00561BNFY,I really wanted to totally love this but alas...I thought it was okay. Dirk Bogarde is good as someone applying for a job in England and goes to a glass company and is hired but what he doesn't know is he will be a spy. Sylvia Koscina is assigned to spy on him and well you get it....just a little dull at times. for old film buffs and for those who like movies that take a poke at James Bond....you will maybe smile but that will be about it. Fun but not something you should go out of your way to see.,1409011200,,503,3.9411764705882355
8459006,5,B00561BNFY,"Very fun film for those who remember Dirk Bogarde and like a mild parody film.  It's supposed to be a parody of a 007 film, but it doesn't go nearly far enough in the humor to really qualify for that.  A little to subtle there.",1373760000,3,227,4.022222222222222
8459007,1,B00561BNFY,"Don't buy this movie.  Stop, stop stop stop.  Don't try to justify the low price in your head as qualifying it for a purchase.  This is a Blu-ray title where the transfer wasn't done well at all.  The video quality drops noticably multiple times.  The story isn't really a comedy, as the advertisements try to sell it.  This is an occassionally interesting peek into the attitudes and mindsets of Hollywood towards Cold War era espionage, and as such it's amazing to see how much the writer and director try to sugar over the obvious danger and tension of the times.  The acting was okay, but the script and everything else struck me as lame.  There's no passion to this movie.  I don't plan on watching it again anytime soon.  Like the misguided Hollywood mindset of that era, I'd prefer to let this movie become a thing of the past.  Once again, it's technically flawed and thematically underwhelming.  Don't buy this.",1359072000,3,920,4.68125
8459008,4,B00561BNFY,"""Agent 8-3/4"" or (AKA: ""Hot Enough for June"") was a bit of a diversion for its director Ralph Thomas who also brought us the Eurospy films that brought a definite threat to James Bond in the line of a Bulldog Drummond series starring Richard Johnson as the insurance investigator in ""Deadlier Than the Male"" (also starring Elke Sommer and Sylva Koscina) and its lesser sequel ""Some Girls Do"" (with Daliah Lavi) and also rather stodgy affair, ""Nobody Runs Forever"" with Christopher Plummer and Rod Taylor. In ""Agent 8-3/4"" he was wise to cast Dirk Bogarde opposite Sylva Koscina as Bogarde is quite at home in droll British comedy and what it develops into, romantic suspense in Communist Czechoslovakia.  It is quite handsomely done in a rather low-key fashion.  Robert Morley and Leo McKern are also in the cast, with Morley trying to steal every scene he is in.  Noel Harrison has a bit speaking part.  VCI Entertainment has brought it to us in a beautiful Blu-ray and also in DVD format from the Rank Organization.  The original novel is by Lionel Davidson and the screenplay by Lukas Heller.  In beautiful Eastmancolor.",1345248000,12,1123,4.853403141361256
8459009,5,B00561BNFY,"I had never heard of this film despite being quite a Bogarde fan in my youth and still living in the UK when it came out.  However, after reading the reviews on Amazon I ordered it and we watched it recently.  For a film that is coming up to fifty years old it holds up amazingly well. The humour is quite remarkably current, particularly the sublety of Robert Morley's performance hinting at all sorts of things that never really come out.  I particularly enjoyed seeing a lot of my favourite British actors of the latter part of the last century, often in very small roles.  I really was not able to recognise several of the actors listed at the beginning of the film and one irritation is that there is no list of who played whom at the end.  I did recognise John Standing, though, the acting baronet!",1337472000,5,804,4.405405405405405
8459010,4,B00561BNFY,"When James Bond came along in 1962's DOCTOR NO, he changed the way audiences enjoyed spy movies and the way that filmmakers made them. The success of the franchise also inspired a slew of imitators and spoofs, and one of the earliest - and best - has just come to Blu-ray disc courtesy of VCI Entertainment: 1964's AGENT 8 3/4 (a/k/a HOT ENOUGH FOR JUNE), starring Dirk Bogarde and Sylva Koscina.

Nicholas Whistler (Bogarde, MODESTY BLAISE) is an unemployed, Czech-fluent writer living in England, when he is - completely unbeknownst to him - recruited by British Intelligence for a mission to Prague. He thinks he's on a goodwill visit from a London glass manufacturer, but the Czechoslovakian Secret Police - and everyone else - knows he's a spy. A female Czech operative, the comely Comrade Simonova (Koscina, DEADLIER THAN THE MALE) is assigned to be his driver and keep an eye on him, but before long, she falls for the handsome, hapless writer. By the time that Whistler finally realizes that he is, indeed a spy, he's trapped in Prague, hunted and pursued by the Secret Police, and only the lovely, conflicted Comrade Simonova can possibly help him.

Deftly directed by Ralph Thomas, AGENT 8 3/4 is a breezy, Cold War-era satire that evokes not only 007, but Hitchcock's espionage thrillers, as well. It's suspenseful and even thrilling at times, but also witty and occasionally farcical - which is why a lot of modern viewers might not be able to get a handle on it. The script is clever and sharp, and the cast, which also includes Leo McKern and Robert Morley, is exceptional across the board. Bogarde is amusing and convincing as the somewhat clueless unintentional agent who must rise to the occasion when his support system falls apart, and Koscina is just stunningly gorgeous. The cinematography is beautiful, even when portraying the drab, behind-the-Iron Curtain world of Communist Czechoslovakia. Overall, it's a slick, early-Sixties spy-fi spoof and highly entertaining, if you're in the right mindset.

VCI's new Blu-ray disc appears to be the same high-def transfer used by the UK company, Network, presented in 1.78:1 widescreen 1080p HD. Picture quality is astoundingly good - with the exception of one or two brief shots, detail and colors appear to be perfect. VCI offers two audio options: Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono and an enhanced 5.1 remix. The only extras are a theatrical trailer (under the original British title of HOT ENOUGH FOR JUNE) and a still photo gallery. The title is also available in standard-def DVD.

AGENT 8 3/4 (I have to say, I like the British title much better) is a great slice of sly Cold War pop culture, and a must-see for fans of 60s spy flicks.",1328659200,6,2696,4.867102396514161
