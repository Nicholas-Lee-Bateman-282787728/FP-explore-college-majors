6647841,4,B00NF6P80I,"First of all, I am an Ancient Alien junkie. I stumbled upon this show on cable one day and was lifted into the Mother Ship and like Richard Dryfuss and I think I go for the ride until the end.

Please note that I always look for the best deal. I actually bought this set at Walmart for $39.99+tax. I have seen it at that price on Amazon before with 2 day Prime shipping, just not when I was in the market to buy it. At the time of this review, it was selling for a whopping $77.99. Too much in my opinion. $40 is the max I would personally pay for this, especially they have listed it at that market price in the past. Also, look at your local Walmart, they seem to always have it between $39.00 and $44.99.

This introductory package give you seasons 1-6 in a clear clam-shell type case. The disks are arranged on each other on plastic inserts (see picture). They can be hard to get out, so take care and be patient. You will need to do some rearranging to find the one you want to get to. The disks are DVD and I have yet to find a glitch in one of them. They do take some time and manipulation to find the one you want. There is no episode guide other than some seasons are marked with episode contents on the disk itself. So, let's get this out of the way. I did the legwork for you:

This is a great 6 season set  (released from the History channel from 2010-2014) which contains 82 episodes (68 hours and 58 mins. of show!). The case also touts that it contains 12 never before released episodes.

I love watching these show and I'm glad I picked this up at a great price.

4 Stars for less than perfect packaging (some disks get loose from the holder) and it did not come with an episode guide. All disks worked though and episodes played flawlessly.",1514505600,3,4152,4.489389920424403

6647851,5,B00NF6P80I,"Some may call Ancient Aliens far-fetched but no one can accuse it of not being well thought out and entertaining. I find it interesting how the show can take pretty much any subject and somehow tie it in to the ""Ancient Alien Theory"".

Here we have seasons 1-6 all in one place. Twenty-three dvds. Eighty-two episodes. Sixty-nine hours.

If you already own the individual season sets, there really is no need to buy this. It is the same discs from the season sets packaged together on spindles in a sturdy box. The packaging says it contains 12 episodes new to dvd. Technically this is true as this boxset was released in November 2014 and the 12 new episodes are from the Ancient Aliens Season 6 vol. 2 set which wasn't release until January 2015.

I highly recommend this for anybody new to the show that doesnt already own the individual season sets.

The ""pages"" are cheap plastic and the snaps are really hard to get off without bending the disc slightly. Additionally, the discs are layered on  top of each other so you have to take multiple discs out to get to the other ones. However, I love the show!

Seasons 1 and 2 are just exactly like the originals so you still have to play each episode separately and hit play 2x to play the episode.  The digital quality of seasons 1 and 2 seems a bit diminished.  Seasons 3 to 5 are also just copied from the original and have the same irritating Comercials that were on the originals.  Season 5 and 6 appear remastered. Have had episodes added that were left off the originals.  Season 6 digital quality seems outstanding.  Some of the episodes of seasons 5 and 6 may also be remastered.  The content and themes are unchanging and if this is the sort of thing you like, you will really like this set.",1485302400,,777,4.415492957746479

6647907,5,B00NF6P80I,"I bought the ancient aliens mega box set which included Giorgios searching for ancient aliens. The information presented in these documentaries is good.
Some of it is historical fact, historical interpretation, scriptural interpretation, physical fact and physical interpretation. So there is a lot of so called truth with in this and there is also a lot fo guess work. I particularly found the episode on crop circles fascination.
This doco does contradict modern science so if you have a bias with that then this will be nuts, to you.
Personally I believe in a God called Jehovah and the interesting thing I found with ancient alien's is this. We disregard the existence of God. That was in the first season. So they made that loud and clear from the word go.
All of the people in this doco misinterpret the bible. I am very familiar with it and interpretations are manipulated to correlate with the ancient astronaut theory.

The rest of ancient aliens is all strictly non god belief.
Often they simply deny the current historical record of science or they pick up where science finished.
They believe someone like lucy was genetically altered by aliens.
Most of the time they refer to aliens as spirits and not physical beings but Giorgio like the idea that the aliens were flesh and blood.
So they continually jump the gun on that one.
I enjoy learning about ancient and modern cultures that the west has nothing to say about.
The theory often overlaps itself with new interpretation over the old and back again.
I found it interesting that Christians will bash this theory because apparently it is blasphemous but at the same time, Christians and Ancient Alienists share the same belief.
The sons of God theory, that is the theory that angels mated with humans to create hybrids.
I find that ironic and amusing especially when Christians get their self righteous hats on.
There is a lot to learn from these documentaries but I also believe its a risk to watch this.
Well no more of a risk then believing in evolution.
I guess what I am trying to say is this.
Don't believe everything you are told.",1483315200,,2103,4.745901639344262

If you really get into this stuff, you should read one or more of the books by Zecharia Sitchin, such as ""The 12th Planet"",  or  ""The Annunaki Chronicles""  by Sitchen's niece,  which is sort of a Cliff's Notes to Sitchin's books.

It is a little inconvenient, yes, but there are 23 discs in this case.  And it could be a lot bulkier and have a lot more waste but it does not due to how they decided to package this.

Pro(s): Um, hello - SIX full seasons of Ancient Aliens on DVD for our binging pleasure?  Also, we can stop freaking out H2 is gone (a moment of silence please.  Thank you).  This product is streamlined, however, I don't feel it's overly streamlined which keeps it compact as possible. Quality in general is really nice, the picture is fantastic.  Sound is great - that's a huge one for me because sometimes you get television shows on DVD and it's a constant UP and DOWN with the volume, not on this set.  That alone is worth a whole star.

Con(s): Getting the discs in and out can be troublesome, take your time and be gentle (the case feels fragile) and it will love you back.  (Or, transfer to another type of case, which I did.) ... that's it for me, folks.",1465603200,,1095,4.216346153846154

The DVD holding compartments do not have the push button holder witch is another reason I feel like this happened. Fortunately none of the DVDs were scratched. I'd also like to note that the DVD case feels extremely compact, there are 23 discs in this tiny case, with 2 DVDs on top of each other in many spots.

6648082,5,B00NF6P80I,"Some may call Ancient Aliens far-fetched but no one can accuse it of not being well thought out and entertaining. I find it interesting how the show can take pretty much any subject and somehow tie it in to the ""Ancient Alien Theory"".

Here we have seasons 1-6 all in one place. Twenty-three dvds. Eighty-two episodes. Sixty-nine hours.

If you already own the individual season sets, there really is no need to buy this. It is the same discs from the season sets packaged together on spindles in a sturdy box. I personally hate this type of packaging and will be putting the dvds in different packaging. The packaging says it contains 12 episodes new to dvd. Technically this is true as this boxset was released in November 2014 and the 12 new episodes are from the Ancient Aliens Season 6 vol. 2 set which wasn't release until January 2015.

I highly recommend this for anybody new to the show that doesnt already own the individual season sets.

1-5 is Correct,  then 5 vol 2 and Season 6 Volume 1 and 2 are actually Season 7 and 8,  then the individual season after that are wrong in their boxes too.
Selling as Season 7, is actually Season 9,  Season 8 is actually Season 10.
So if you buy all Seasons 1-10 you actually have all Season 1-12 as they aired and are listed on IMDB and History Channel.
I am not sure how all this happened and then continued to happen.

Think of it this way,  there is actually No Volume 1 and 2 for seasons 5 and 6.  Its actually Season 5-8.
Seems like someone else would have caught this prior and made changes.  But no,  they just keep selling them all listed WRONG>",1530921600,,785,4.105263157894737

Where did it all start\?  No one really knows for sure. How were the early cities and monuments built?  By who?  Anyone who does not think we were visited by aliens from another space location, probably still believes in Easter Bunny and Santa Clause. How were those heavy 50 to 200 ton perfectly cut stones moved and placed for the walls and buildings.  A book titled ""Chariots of the gods"" was written almost 50 years ago around 1970 which I bought it and could not put it down.  Too many unexplained mysteries of events that happened thousands of years ago. Egypt, Mexico, Peru,  Easter Island and other places around this planet that remain unexplained.
