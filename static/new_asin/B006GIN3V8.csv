8497641,4,B006GIN3V8,"I loved this film (especially the silent version)! It had a great storyline as a narrative, and I was deeply interested and loved the film! However, it's aspect ratio is Standard, and the menu selections were misplaced a bit, which is the reason why you don't want to watch it on a Widescreen TV (it was okay on my Windows 8 laptop). That's okay, because it is still amazing; a must-buy!",1412640000,,387,4.464788732394366
