8274481,4,B0019M6QL0,"This is a good video if all you want is an overview of chemistry, its history and some of the major advances.  I was looking for something more specific for a high school chemistry class.  Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.  It moves a little slow in places so I stopped it several times to expand upon the information presented.  It can be a useful teaching tool is applied correctly along with the regular curriculum.
Overall, not bad depending upon your use.",1361664000,,468,4.535714285714286
