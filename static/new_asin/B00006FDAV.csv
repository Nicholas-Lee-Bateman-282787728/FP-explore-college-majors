1745214,3,B00006FDAV,"The Hoodlum Priest is based on the life and work of an actual Jesuit priest ,Father Clark, who was heavily involved in the provision of support to newly released former convicts in St Louis. The movie was co-scripted by its star Don Murray under the pseudonym Don Deer. The other scriptwriter was Joseph Landon .
The movie focuses on Father Clark's relationship with one particular man ,Billy (Keir Dullea-giving a striking and memorable performance on his movie debut).Billy is released from prison and with the help of the priest begins his adjustment to life on the outside very well .He secures a place to live ,gets a job and acquires a steady ,respectable girlfriend (Cindi Wood).Then things begin to go wrong -he is unjustly fired from his job ,decides to exact revenge by burglarising the place and ,when the robbery is interrupted, kills a man .Billy is put on trial for murder and his life hangs in the balance.
The movie was shot in 1961 but feels like an older movie in some ways ;it is easy to imagine the movie being made 2 decades earlier with Pat O'Brien as the priest and somebody like John Garfield in the Dullea role .The movie is well shot in crisp monochrome and the direction by Irvin Kerschner is restrained and semi-documentary in feel. The peformances are sincere and earnest .The one big bugbear I have with the movie is its script which is an odd mixture of the pious and the profane and inclined to moralise .It is a ""message movie""about the need for aftercare for ex-convicts in order to make it easier for them to readjust to life in ""normal society"" .A worthy sentiment but here the story  stops and starts too much as the script keeps making the point in a preachy way.

The movie is sincere and well intentioned and is not to be lightly brushed aside but it needed a sharper script to make its point without sermonising .",1195776000,9,1854,4.598187311178248
1745235,5,B00006FDAV,"If you like social issues docudramas, this film is a fascinating slice of cinema history. Filmed on the cheap in 1961 by a young Irvin Kershner long before ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Never Say Never Again,"" this 90ish-minute B&W film tells the story of Fr. Charles Dismas Clark SJ, who founded ""Dismas House"" in St. Louis to help ex-cons find gainful employment. Played by Hollywood lightweight Don Murray, the good Jesuit Father comes across as a bit inauthentic, but the surrounding atmosphere is appropriately gritty. A pre-""2001"" Keir Dullea plays an ex-con on the mend whom Father Clark attempts to help, leading to a climactic showdown. Overall, the film feels like a downbeat indie version of ""Boys Town"" or ""Going My Way,"" offering a rather bleak and realistic assessment of social justice work.

The DVD itself is a bare-bones affair with only ""play"" and chapter stop features, plus the theatrical trailer.

According to interviews, Murray spearheaded the effort to make this film after meeting the real Father Clark, a roughneck type who lived to see this film. The movie itself apparently exists to offer a semi-fictionalized account of Clark's uphill battle to found the first halfway houses in America, but the low budget limits its scope considerably. Nevertheless, footage of St. Louis's seedier elements and the film's general verisimilitude help offset the miscast Murray quite a bit, in addition to the fact that the movie is surprisingly watchable. Some of the political and religious tensions in the film are fascinating, particularly the media backlash against coddling the homeless and the ""St. Dismas"" crucifix featured in Father Clark's home. As an indie film before indie films became self-conscious, I recommend it.",1396137600,5,1745,5.2064056939501775
1745236,5,B00006FDAV,"This movie is kinda dated and corny, but the acting is so superb that it transcends the plot. I saw it in the 60s on TV and it always stuck with me. Bought it to own.",1391990400,,166,3.638888888888889
1745237,4,B00006FDAV,"Its hard to say anything bad about Don Murray since I've had a crush on him since the bath tub scene in Bus Stop (1956).  The opening scene of the Missouri Pacific train arriving at the Jefferson City, Missouri depot was perfect. Murray is the charming Hoodlum Priest in this gritty tale based on a true story.",1384560000,,310,4.43859649122807
1745238,4,B00006FDAV,"Catholic  Father Charles Clark was the real hoodlum priest who started a halfway house for ex-convicts in St. Louis. He approached actor Don Murray, told him of his work, and so inspired him that Murray lobbied to get the film made, eventually taking the title role, writing the screenplay, and producing it. The movie centers on Clark's involvement with one desperate youth, played by Keir Dullea in his first film.
The role pigeonholed Dullea as a troubled man in his next roles. He finally fully broke free from the typecasting when he became the only surviving astronaut in  2001: A Space Odyssey.
The Hoodlum Priest proved to be a blessing or curse for all involved. United Artists subsequently offered Murray and his production partner a 10-film deal but that agreement fizzled. Initially receiving rave reviews, the movie faded away as a St. Louis newspaper and one involved with the production bad mouthed it. United Artists sold the television rights to it before it had any viable run in theaters.
Nevertheless, it is still recognized for a unique method of storytelling, in which more emphasis was placed on setting and scenes than dialog.",1375315200,,1150,4.984375

1745241,5,B00006FDAV,"The Hoodlum Priest, 1961 film

This is based on the real life of Father Charles Dismas Clark SJ, a priest in St. Louis Missouri who tried to help paroled criminals as a domestic missionary. He tried to help offenders with advice and job offers. We see a dice game; the winner was found with loaded dice and is punished. Fr. Clark asks for help from Louis Rosen, the best criminal lawyer in town for Billy Lee Jackson. Mr. Stern tells a different story about the attack so Jackson is freed. Can he get a job? [You see scenes of the city in 1961.] Fr. Clark wants a place where offenders can live while working. Lawyer Rosen invests in a building. Released prisoners need a job and a place to live else they go back to prison. [Do you know what it costs to house a prisoner for a year?] A reporter asks an embarrassing question at a party.

A judge hears the conflicting testimony between an assistant prosecutor and Fr. Clark, who wants a ""halfway house"" for recently released prisoners. This goes against the rules for parole at that time. Clark grew up in a coal town in Pennsylvania where the mine owners oppressed workers. The media exploits crime and violence but does nothing to aid criminals before and after. [Economics drives crime as it does politics.] We hear a cynical news reporter speak. The Society of Jesus will allow Fr. Clark to work full-time with ex-convicts (saving sinners?). The police investigate the loss of ten cases of meat from the cold room where Billy works. Billy won't give up the name of the girl he was with as his alibi. Billy is fired. Later he and a pal burglarize a business to crack the safe. One of the managers comes by and hears the noise of drilling. He calls the police and then goes to investigate. There is a shot! The police chase Billy. We see the ""slum clearance area"". There is another shot by Billy, a policeman is hit. [Note those railroad yards.]

A crowd gathers to watch the action. [No thought of a stray shot?] Fr. Clark arrives to help and runs into that abandoned building. The police have a tear gas gun and a police dog. Billy's pistol has only three bullets left. Fr. Clark tells what will happen. The jury convicts Jackson of first degree murder and he is sentenced to death. Lawyer Rosen and Fr. Clark plead with the Governor for clemency, but the Governor sticks with the law. That young woman visits Billy, so does Fr. Clark. Prayers are offered. Its time to walk the last mile. You can see the terror on Billy's face as he is seated in the gas chamber. The warden throws the switch. There is a heavy rain, water flows down a gutter. Another ex-convict drinks that night, from mourning or some emotion?

This is an interesting and educational story about ""Dismas House"", the pioneering halfway house begun in St. Louis Missouri. These halfway houses are now very common. They were started in spite of the parole rules of that time. This movie echoes ""I Want to Live"", a somewhat better story taken from a true crime. It did not have a big budget and big stars of that era.",1343692800,,3037,4.496376811594203
1745242,5,B00006FDAV,This movie is  very worthwhile even if dated. The message is positive and we don't get many movies with positive messages in this day and age.,1319328000,2,142,4.461538461538462
1745243,4,B00006FDAV,"The Hoodlum Priest is a better than average crime drama, tame by today's standards, but still a good black and white film that has some merit. Don Murray appears in a symphathetic role of a kind priest dedicated to helping ex-cons adjust to life on the outside after their release from prison. Unfortunately, his efforts to assist parolee Billy, played by Keir Dullea in his first screen role, end tragically. Dullea is excellent as a young irresponsible thug who initially follows the guidance of Father Dismas Clark, but then carelessly murders his employer during a robbery. Dullea really gets into the role as a tense, scared, doomed man in his final moments before breathing in the deadly fumes of the gas chamber.

Dullea of course, went on to star in Kubrick's 1968 hit 2001: A Space Odyssey, and recently played a minor role as Senator Russell in 2006's The Good Shepard. If you like this early 60's drama, you might also enjoy The Young Savages, also from 1961, starring Burt Lancaster, Shelly Winters, Dina Merrill, and a young Telly Savalas.",1258588800,3,1052,4.844444444444444
