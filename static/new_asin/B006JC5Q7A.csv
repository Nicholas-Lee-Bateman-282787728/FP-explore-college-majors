4992955,5,B006JC5Q7A,This video footage is beautiful and there is something timeless about looking at it all from gliding up above. Watch this at the end of the day to unwind...it will put you to sleep (in a good way).,1341878400,,197,4.2105263157894735
4992956,4,B006JC5Q7A,This is a great video and is now even better in Blu-ray. This was produced by Maryland Public Television so it covers only the Northern portion of the bay. I would have given it 5 stars had it showed more. Still worth it though.,1334793600,3,228,4.204545454545454

4992964,5,B006JC5Q7A,"I grew up a few miles west of the Chesapeake and recently tried to move, only to find myself wanting to come home.  This DVD captures the true beauty of the bay, and is a nice change over hearing the C and D grades the bay has been receiving.  I picked up a few to send to friends so they would start to understand why I love this area so much. Great to have on mute in the background as well, a moving TV wallpaper of the bay.

Worth the money!",1362614400,,445,3.868131868131868
4992965,5,B006JC5Q7A,"I have been seeing this program on MPT for some time now, and I was disappointed to find that I had to make a very sizable donation in order to own the program outright.

8499345,4,B006JC5Q7A,"We bought this after seeing most of it on TV.  We were impressed!  After moving in the area two years ago, we have been exploring the historical sights.  My family came to america on the Swan in the early Jamestown so the connection is in my mind.
