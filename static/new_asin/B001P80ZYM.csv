3741552,4,B001P80ZYM,"Yup, soundtrack is sometimes out of synch, but considering the quality of the filming from that era (in still shots of a skyline, one building starts to move like it's animated)... it's not really a distraction. Altogether a very pleasant romp from the past, when audiences would arrive for the show in canoes and little boys were left to run around on their own at camp.",1358812800,,371,4.636363636363637
3741553,5,B001P80ZYM,"Basil Rathbone and Bobby Breen are too delightful in this movie about a boy (Bobby Breen) who meets a a talented and ever so handsome composer(Basil Rathbone), during his summer vacation. I give this movie 5 stars because it is made just right. Good acting, good songs, sweet story without being soppy, overall, a fun movie. Rent it from Netflix though, because the audio is out of sync on amazon instant view, and I found the overall sound and picture better with the rented disc from Netflix.
 Give ""Make A Wish"" a try, because you will be glad you did!",1342742400,4,555,4.55
3741554,2,B001P80ZYM,"If you don't really watch the movie and just listen to the music, it's fine.  Unfortunately, the film and the voices are not in
sync.  If I were to ""make a wish"" on this one, it would be for a better quality DVD.",1296345600,5,212,3.9069767441860463
8332438,4,B001P80ZYM,"A 1937 black and white so the film quality is poor as is typical for a movie so old. The voice was slightly out of sync but I actually only noticed that a couple of times so not an issue for me.  I gave it a 4 stars because it's just a sweet film. The kids are polite and everyone dressed up.  Reminded me so much of my Dad who grew up in that era and all his old pics, everyone was always dressed up.  Of course not a nasty word in the whole thing, not so much as even a kiss between the love interests.  It's refreshing to watch a movie and not come away feeling all dirty and guilty like in todays shows.  These were simpler days and it is refreshing. One of the things I like about old movies is looking up the stars and reading about them.  I was shocked to see that the star, Billy Breen, was alive until just 4 short months ago (passed in Sept 2016).  Again, that is part of the allure of old movies, seeing what else they did, how their careers panned out, etc.",1485820800,,969,3.963917525773196
8332439,2,B001P80ZYM,"Cliched movie. Interesting only to see Breen, and that the story and screenplay were written by Gertrude Berg (not that you'd know it)",1484179200,,134,4.869565217391305
8332440,5,B001P80ZYM,"In spite of the present-day movies, this kind of ""old fashioned"" movie still is very satisfying.  I recommend it to all, especially todays young people so they can get a glimpse into a more gentle time.",1481846400,,202,4.611111111111111
8332441,5,B001P80ZYM,"The music and lyrics are wonderful.  Yes, the film is old, and the script might be somewhat sophomoric, but  the sound is pretty good and all players have extraordinary voices.",1456531200,,176,4.833333333333333
8332442,1,B001P80ZYM,"Very much a product of its time...characters were sterotypical, plot routine, outcome predictable.",1439078400,,98,6.615384615384615
8332443,4,B001P80ZYM,"Hadn't seen this movie for many years. Breen & Claire had wonderful voices. Good enough story. Maybe the Baz wasn't ideal for musicals,but he sure looked like he was playing piano,and I would've picked him over Ralph any day of the week.",1434499200,,237,4.666666666666667
8332444,2,B001P80ZYM,Only watched about 15 minutes. Didn't like it as much as another Bobby Breen movie I had seen.,1430265600,,94,4.277777777777778
8332445,4,B001P80ZYM,"This movie is a treat.  It's 1937, Basil Rathbone and musical should not go together.  Bobby Breen had an amazing voice as a child star. And Marion Claire who did only 1 movie in her career begs the question what did she do with the rest of her life of 85 years - she had also a wonderful voice.  The cover is misleading. The film is in black and white.",1425081600,,353,4.014285714285714
8332446,4,B001P80ZYM,Enjoyed it. Just wish the captioning included the words to the songs. Couldn't always follow.,1418515200,,93,5.266666666666667
8332447,5,B001P80ZYM,"Just another nice little story.  Cute boy, I'll have to watch more of his films. Bobby Breen, I don't know anything about him, but, it looks like he produced this film.  True the sound and video were not in sync, but, this was still 1937, and this film was not made or released by one of the Major studios of that time. Maybe in the future this little gem will be fixed up, refurbished, but, it is still a good little film.",1363392000,,423,4.146341463414634
