8482959,3,B005Q6WX62,"I am so so so so disappointed with Tooni however, jealous she got investors to fund this boring film. I am so mad too or I just didn't get it, why was it so long and yes I know there was no dancing it.  That may have been the problem for me. I am a still a fan of Tooni though.....I hope and wish to meet her some day....If you want a non bhangra style bollywood story here it is....it does exist. Its a normal movie, not over the top, story drags though.",1343779200,,455,3.89247311827957
