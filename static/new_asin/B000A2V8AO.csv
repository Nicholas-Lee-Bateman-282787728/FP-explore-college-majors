2353744,5,B000A2V8AO,"This is a ripping adventure, there's humor, cuteness and guns. Lots of guns.
A messenger from the future comes to the past in a last-ditch effort to save Earth from angry and superior attacking Aliens by stopping the war before it has a chance to start. She gets help from a gangster-type after convincing him she's telling the truth, and they cross paths with the man he wants to kill who is completely evil without inhibitions, who only wants to rule from the top of the world. When they find out there's an Alien who crash-landed and all the advanced technology of the sentient ship there's a race on to see who will grab it all for profit or who will return the Alien and avert the war. There's sort of a convoluted timeline that might have you thinking, ""Exactly how did that happen?"" An excellent Science-fiction film that doesn't go off-course. Well-made and believable with just enough technology, decent plot, likeable characters and feel-good message!",1428969600,,961,4.795180722891566
2353745,4,B000A2V8AO,Entertaining and interesting twist.  Kind of a cute movie.  The acting is ok.  I've seen Takeshi in better films.  But he's so good looking I like to watch any film with him in it.  LOL!  My favorite of his will always be House of Flying Daggers.,1427846400,,246,4.239130434782608

2353748,5,B000A2V8AO,"Saw bits of this on TV and had to track down the movie to see the whole thing.  I wasn't disappointed.  This is how they should do real life anime/sci fi.  This is sci fi adventure done first class.  Great script, fine acting (even the over the top villains are ok since it's dubbed and that softens the bad dubbing acting, and the not quite believable villain acting).",1416355200,,369,4.382352941176471
2353759,5,B000A2V8AO,I first saw this movie on cable years ago and just loved it. That's my personal opinion. You might not feel the same way. Action sequences are good and story is good but the main characters I just love.,1414454400,,202,4.205128205128205
2353760,5,B000A2V8AO,I love it.  Takeshi is a great actor in this movie.  It has a great story line that you will enjoy.  I love the marital arts display and the actors are great as well.  If you are a true marital arts fan you will add this to your collection.,1414454400,,240,3.836734693877551

2353762,5,B000A2V8AO,English subtitles.  This film has good acting and very good action.  The story line is what ET. should have been.  Cool flick.,1400198400,,126,4.636363636363637
2353763,5,B000A2V8AO,I've loved this movie and finally had the chance to buy it. Good special effects and great story line. Awesommmme!,1395964800,,114,4.75

2353767,4,B000A2V8AO,"With unabashed flare, director Takashi Yamazaki borrows nearly every sci-fi plot there is and concocts a neat story that follows an unlikely pair's efforts to rescue an alien from mobsters.  Unfortunately, the duo must face a psychotic henchman along the way.  Now then, this feature does have an uneven script with its occasional digressions.  No surprise when there are so many ideas flying all about.  While the movie is content to be simply lively and stylish for two acts, the third act is a completely different ballgame.  The final thirty minutes is unforgettable with its satisfying shootout on an oil rig and a promise kept by one of the heroes.  Also, the chemistry between actors Anne Suzuki and Takeshi Kaneshiro is the real highlight of this picture - not the visual effects.  ""Returner"" is irresistible fun and is an amazing adventure overall.
  COMMENTS:  {SPOILER ALERT}  Every once in a while a good film contains a great scene.  There is no doubt one of my favorite cinematic moments is the fading Milly saying goodbye to Miyamoto who realizes at last how much their friendship means to him.  It is an incredibly moving scene that brings me to tears every time I watch it.  There is something heart aching about that moment that I cannot bring to words.  {By the way, I wish some studio would put this on blu-ray.}",1378080000,,1332,4.780701754385965
2353768,2,B000A2V8AO,"For acting, the plot, or the point of this movie.  I don't know if the world was  waiting for ET to meet the Matrix and the Terminator.  Time travel, aliens, and crazy action scenes.  What more could anyone want?  Well decent acting, scripting, and logic would help.  Really a dissappointment.",1373241600,,293,4.76
2353789,4,B000A2V8AO,"This film is like a combination of ""E.T."", ""The Terminator"", and maybe ""Transformers"" all in one film.

I knew if you're reading this it's because you already seen the film. So, with all the cool special effects, and dark scenery, this film would be really cool to have this film mastered better in High Definition and then released on Blu-Ray.

2353790,4,B000A2V8AO,"I tuned into this Japanese film on one of the cable channels late last night. I had no expectations as the description made it sound like a cheap knock-off from Japan. I ended up getting caught up in it and enjoying the ride. The copy I saw was in English at first, before switching to a little Chinese and a lot of Japanese (with English subtitles for the latter two, of course). I'd never heard of any of the actors, but I loved the hero, the heroine and the shady, elderly Japanese woman who helped them; all three parts were very well acted. The special effects were quite good and not at all cheap looking. I enjoyed the unexpected plot twist that came shortly after the middle of the movie; it made it a lot more interesting. The only thing that made me laugh aloud was when they showed the alien ""Dragga"" without its huge robotic suit; it looked like a small but faithful version of E.T., and it actually was trying to get home, though not trying to phone home. I decided this one error in judgment on the part of the filmmaker was not going to ruin the movie for me and, once that was accomplished, I really liked the film. It's fun and action filled, plus the characters are really believable. Check it out!",1346803200,,1216,4.361233480176211
2353791,4,B000A2V8AO,"""Returner"" is a Japanese over-the-top sci-fier that aims to please and succeeds by far.  It is a mash-up of a variety of sci-fi (and other) movies that you know and love:

""Independence Day"" (big giant spaceships that hover over earth and small alien craft that are extremely fast and powerful)
""Transformers"" (large jumbo jets and jet fighters that transform into alien spaceships)
""E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial"" (lost and dying single alien just wants to return home)
""The Matrix"" (slo-mo gun battles & flowing, black trenchcoats elegantly worn by lead Takeshi Kaneshiro as Miyamoto)
""The Terminator"" (a girl, Milly, goes back in time to stop the alien invasion from wiping out mankind and creating a dystopian future)
""Back To the Future"" (time travel plotline gets a little love when we see that our heroine has traveled back into the past more than once...)
""King Kong Escapes"" (Mizoguchi the villain, a kooky gonzo gangster that you'll love to hate, is played with incredulous verve by Goro Kishitani, an actor with facial features and white hair make-up that channels KKE's villainous Dr. Who in both looks and maniacism)
""The Godfather"" (internal strife within a triad/ mobster's holdings leads to death)
""Pretty Woman"" (Milly, all slovenly dressed and streaked with dirt and sans makeup, is ecstatic to get a makeover)
""Mission Impossible 2"" (John Woo style slo-mo gun ballets with a scene of a backward-flipped motorcycle drawing a gun on its pursuers)
""The Replacements Killers"" (Miyamoto is an assassin who takes on, begrudingly, Milly as his client)

And more!  There are so many movie tropes from so many different types of movies (say, Hong Kong gangster flicks or karate revenge yarns) that the ""Returner"" is just fun to watch and try to figure out what movie they stole a particular scene or idea from.  That being said it works surprisingly well on its own merits and storyline.  A fun movie to watch and one you'll want to revisit, with friends, from time to tme.  Let me know what movie you spot in this one!  Have fun.",1343088000,,2038,4.956011730205279
2353792,5,B000A2V8AO,"This is a rare movie now a days. It is true science fiction like it should be. Suspense, action, great characters and a great plot. Minimal  special effects because the story is compelling. It is real science fiction because for the most part you could almost believe it could happen.",1340928000,,284,4.68
2353793,5,B000A2V8AO,"I was suprised.  This movie is good.  Awesome actions scenes, special effects and....wait for it.... a good story!  Of the modern Japanese action movies(and for some reason there are not enough)this is one to watch.",1337644800,,215,5.085714285714285

2353795,5,B000A2V8AO,"Love this video. The acting and the action are stubbornly unique. The Actors are so much more believable because they are unknowns and the storyline is fascinating.
Have to watch it over, regularly. And nobody gets pregnant, despite all the violent action, guns and aliens!
I just love it! I cried!
If you like Sci-Fi with genuine emotion and slabs of Asian violence, THIS IS YOUR MOVIE.",1303084800,,387,4.791044776119403
2353796,4,B000A2V8AO,"I was surprised at how good it was. I honestly didn't mind spending all that time reading subtitles. If that's your reason for rating it low, you need to grow up as a cinema fan. The story is great, the acting superb and the film as a whole is great.",1278720000,,250,4.02
2353797,3,B000A2V8AO,"'Returner' is a real find - a vividly imagined time-travel thriller with not-cheesy FX and a cool visual style. It's a live action movie, but the swagger and sense of humor in 'Returner' come straight from Japanese anime and Manga. It's also a buddy flick whose two leads - a male hitman and a female time-traveler - make a combative, likeable odd couple. Check it out, especially if you're into the 'Terminator' and 'Ghost in the Shell' franchises.",1275177600,,449,4.769230769230769
2353798,1,B000A2V8AO,"I try this flick because of main character from ""Sleepless town"" and should state I look in disbelief at previous 70 positive reviews. All this shooting and special effects go on mainstream TV every day so why we need more? Aliens invaded? We couldn't handle our problems without aliens why we need more? After all this is movie where I expect entertainment, imagination and maybe a lesson but not propaganda and brainwashing.",1266019200,,426,4.930555555555555
2353809,5,B000A2V8AO,"So, while we all love the way that the leading man moves in this movie, waving his guns, we can't deny that, accept for the random American actors playing the scenes from the past, this movie was actually really well acted.  Perhaps, a great humor in this Japanese film is the fact that our male hero, while packing fire power for perhaps a small army, gets suckered into something he, at first, really doesn't want to do.  In fact, I believe this is one of the first Japanese movies that I've ever seen a woman have the upper hand, and one of the only movies period I've seen a woman seduce a man without using active violence or sex.  So, kudos to a movie well directed, a script that works, and an ending that is also less traditional in Japanese society... even, almost happy... :)  So, all in all, glad I watched it, and reading all those subtitles, so worth it... :D",1253404800,,872,4.364197530864198
2353810,4,B000A2V8AO,"The Japanese audio track and English subtitles actually play out a shade better than the English dubbed version, but the English dubbed version is still very good==  this combines elements of time travel, alternate reality, and Alien Invaders with shape shifting mechanical fighting devices, something like taking elements of several science-fiction and fantasy stories to blend it into one pretty good ""a whole lot less money spent than it looks like on the screen"" action movie.

The spoilers would include the advertised fact it is science-fiction, time travel, and Aliens Attacking Earth (all in caps) with a totally unprepared young woman as the ultimate hero of a battle to save our world.

The actors are well chosen, and when you watch the DVD extras it only makes you realize how good they are-- there was almost no wire work, and the impossible leaps are shown in the practice sessions so you can see how they did them.

Okay, it may not be the best movie of this kind ever made, but even if the movie isn't a world beater, the DVD extras are worth the cost as you get to see how they made X yen look like X time ten yen on the screen.

2353811,4,B000A2V8AO,"This is an excellent sci-fi flick. There are some weak moments of acting and the special effect, while awesome when new, are showing there age a little.

2353812,4,B000A2V8AO,"It's nothing earth-shatteringly new, actually, it's a lot of scifi cliches...but cliches happen because everyone loves them, so I see no problem there.  With aliens, matrix inspired gunfights, and time travel, what more do you need?  It was a little gross in a few parts, hence the R rating, and the parts with English dialogue and acting are a little sad, but I think it adds to its charm.  Overall, it was fun and entertaining, and if your a fan of all things Japanese, you will especially enjoy it.",1248134400,,501,4.606741573033708

2353815,4,B000A2V8AO,I had seen this movie before and so wanted to own it ever since. This is a great movie. The real story of `ET'; at least this is the most probable scenario of should this really happen on earth. And `yes' a visit from the future would be necessary to undo the hate that fear has wrought. Excellent movie. Check it out.  MLJohnson,1225411200,,329,4.222222222222222
2353816,4,B000A2V8AO,"Let me start by saying, that I am not a person who seeks out obscure asian films and hordes them.  Nor am I a fan of anime or asian horror.  As a matter of fact I dislike most foreign films with rare exception.  I like good ole wholesome born in the USA films.  Now that my disclaimer is out there, this movie is awesome!  I caught this on TV one day while hanging around the barracks in Okinawa and loved it.  I've spent years since, trying to track down what the title of this movie even is.  It is a rip off of several other American Movies, this is true but it ties them together in such a fun way that it's hard to care.  It may not have the big budget of hollywood but it has twice the heart.",1210118400,,698,3.9357142857142855

It's not something that I would go out and buy right away, but if you have a little scratch in your pocket, and the movie you wanted to buy is sold out, then try Returner. Some cool matrix-like effects, but after watching it, I didn't remember nothing that I'd seen. Not the worst I've seen, but far from the best.",1188345600,,399,4.333333333333333
2353818,4,B000A2V8AO,"I Bought this movie based on a trailer I saw from another DVD. When I first saw the movie I thought  it was okay but not great, but at the same time I wasn't dissappointed at my purchase. The second time I saw the movie I loved it.  The action isn't spectacular but the story is innovative and the visual effects are awesome (keep in mind the movie came out in 2002), and it is clear to see that this movie was a major influence on the visual effects on the 2007 release of Transformers.
This is a great film for any fan of the sci-fi genre",1186531200,,540,4.037383177570093

This one was no different - I really expected a cheesy flick with bad effects. this has a slow start and it's a little hard to follow - then they how scenes from the future and it's like you're sucked into another movie with a REAL budget! It was well acted and well made - I could have seen this being good anime, but they chose to use live action instead - and it actually works!

Not much!  the plot is very clever, well thought out, and well acted.  I also love that the ""heroes"" of the story aren't ""typical"".  I watch it all the time!",1173398400,,319,4.607142857142857
2353832,4,B000A2V8AO,"Returner will no doubt remind you of some other films especially it's actions scenes which remind you a lot of the Matrix but somehow it is still a powerful movie. The thing about it is that the story may be lacking a bit or the plot but when all the elements are put together this film can't be stopped. Returner is about a young teen named Milly (Anne Suzuki) from the future that is in the middle of a war between aliens and humans. In the future they finally got time travel figured out so she is quickly sent back from 2084 to 2002 to stop the war from ever happening. She runs into a loner named Miyamoto who has a couple of secrets and a lot of skills that can come in handy. The movie from there is like a dream and by the end it seems like it never happened.

The stunts and special effects in the Returner is amazing, the fight choreography is sick and the gunplay will remind you of a video game or the anime Mezzo. I think that the only problem with Returner is that it is a little too long; it feels like 3 hours long when you're done watching it. After a while you might start to forget some of the keys to the story. On the acting side this movie was executed near perfect and the characters are interesting enough for fans to desire a sequel but that's unlikely. Returner is a good movie and almost perfect one but it could use some polishing, hopefully a sequel might come up soon.",1162771200,,1398,4.177777777777778
2353833,5,B000A2V8AO,"This movie borrows heavily from other great action flicks. I spotted nods to ""The Matrix"", ""ID4"", ""Batman"" (maybe), even a motorcycle stunt ripped straight out of ""Mission Impossible:2"". Actually, M. Knight Shymalan was probably an influence too. All these influences wrapped into one? You got it; this movie is fun!!! I see these things as respectful nods to great works, so I wasn't at all irritated by the copy-catting. I was well entertained.

The story involves aliens and it gets kinda silly, but the fun keeps you captivated. There's even a surprise twist at the end. Straight outta the M. Knight bag of tricks.

The action is fun. We get a few scenes showcasing the phenomenal revolution known as ""bullet time"". We have fist fights, gun fights, gun fights with aliens... yeah, this movie was REALLY entertaining.

Check it out!!! It's gon' be fun!!!",1161561600,,857,4.9375
2353834,4,B000A2V8AO,"This is not a very deep movie, but if you want to see a fun sci-fi adventure, this would be a good choice. The movie's treatment of time travel (especially the little flashback at the end that explained some subtleties) was more rewarding than its treatment of the aliens. Questions about who the aliens were or why they came in the first place were not even addressed. There was considerable violence, including against kids, so this is not a family movie. But for adults, I would definitely recommend a rental, and if you're a real sci-fi fan, go ahead and buy with confidence. You won't regret it.",1158624000,,600,4.616822429906542
2353835,5,B000A2V8AO,"I liked this movie. If you don't want to buy it, then rent it and see if it is your taste. Several past sci-fi/fantasy elements are used in this film, so you won't get anything new in the way of story-telling, however, what you do get is a very unique and entertaining film. A young girl named Milly (Anne Suzuki) uses a time portal in the year 2084, and arrives in 2002. Her mission is to prevent the aliens from her future from beginning the war with earth in the first place: by averting the cause of the war in the past.

Milly encounters Miyamoto (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and forces him to help her prevent the alien attack that will occur in the near future. Takeshi Kaneshiro does an excellent role as Miyamoto. However, Miyamoto has problems of his own with the psychotic Japanese mob boss Mizoguchi (Goro Kishitani) And it is Mizoguchi that has much to blame for the earth's predictament in the future. He was the one responsible for keeping the alien that lands on earth captive. Which in turn, precipitated the war. You name any sci/fi fantasy in the last 20 years, odds are that it was thrown in the movie.

I really enjoyed watching this movie and was surprised to find that it was not as overly cheesy as I thought it would be.  The characters are likeable, the plot is still interesting albeit copied from elsewhere, and action sequences are not too over-the-top.  If you enjoy pure entertainment, then you'll enjoy this film.

Although I have to admit, there seem to be a lot of ""homages"" ranging from Matrix, Men in Black to Fifth Element, X-Files and so on. Still, it's an action packed with cool style to boot.

She runs into Kaneshiro. She forces him to help her. The action is nonstop. I thought that the characters were likable and the ending was happy. This film is geared to science fiction lovers. It has the typical Matrix like action that most films are sporting these days. If you like action and sci fi this is for you.

But what hasn't been focused upon by many reviewers is the fact that the STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS TAKESHI KANESHIRO IS THE LEAD ACTOR in this movie!!! This movie works because Takeshi Kaneshiro molds this seemingly generic outlaw-character into an original one--one with heart, feeling, and depth. Kaneshiro is a powerful actor--with a versatility unsurpassed by any other actor in the world. He has played richly diverse roles in a wide range of movies, such ""Chungking Express"" (yes, he is pineapple eating dude), ""Sleepless Town,"" ""Lost and Found,"" and ""Odd One Dies."" So it is a GIVEN that this man is a respected actor--and well deservingly so. SO, what I want to focus on is the fact that in this movie KANESHIRO is NOT ONLY in LEATHER PANTS throughout--looking exquisite in every scene--but he is also in a scene making dinner for Suzuki--(women, you should be swooning right about now). Listen, if you thought that Kaneshiro could not look any more beautiful than he does in the Peony Pavilion scene in ""The House of Flying Daggers"", then you are mistaken. Yup. You heard me right.

2353866,5,B000A2V8AO,"I am in awe of ""Returner"".  This has got to be one of the best guilty pleasures of b-movie dom I've seen in a while and I see plenty of b-movies.  This is a movie that blends aliens, the Yakuza, martial arts and time travel into one hodge-podge of action & adventure.  What's not to like?

The film opens up with central character Miyamoto (or the Asian Neo as I like to call him) busting up a Yakuza operation of child kidnapping.  Gunplay ensues and at some point through thin air appears a teenaged girl who helps Miyamoto finish the job.  Later on we find out that the girl, named Milly, is actually a time traveler from the year 2082, a time where nuclear war has wiped out most of civilization.  Her mission is to kill an alien whose spaceship crash lands in a nearby mountain.  Reluctant at first, Miyamoto eventually joins her on her quest, which will also involve warding off the sadistic Yakuza gang who are also after the alien for their own selfish reasons.

As noted by previous reviewers, this film borrows heavily from other science-fiction films, namely Terminator and The Matrix.  Some people will call it a rip-off but I wholeheartedly disagree.  What ""Returner"" does is borrow in a very obvious way some of the best elements of those movies and gives it its own unique spin.  It does not try to conceal that it borrows elements of those films but instead pays tribute to its sources of inspiration. The main reason I loved this film was because of how bloody fun it is.  The action is non-stop, the effects are cheesy yet imaginative, the chemistry between the two leads is great and in good ol' cyberpunk fashion the whole movie is played out to a killer techno soundtrack.

One need not necessarily like Asian films to enjoy this.  As its influences are from American films it often feels more American.  It even manages to entertain in between action sequences, with witty dialogue and a sharp sense of humour.  I never found myself bored during this movie, not even once.  The ending was so over-the-top and visually stunning I had to rub my eyes to make sure I was really seeing what I was seeing.  If you love cyberpunk, sci-fi or action films in general I don't recommend you watch this movie, I order you to do so.

2353867,3,B000A2V8AO,"I first saw parts of this movie on TV several months ago and thought it looked pretty good. The plot is an old one, one lone time-traveler in a desparate last ditch effort to save the future by altering the past, but is done better than many American movies I've seen.

The most confusing thing I saw was the fact that for what is apparently a Japanese film there's so much China/ Tibet(where much of the future part is set) to it.

The characterizations were mostly good, that Yakuza guy was too comic book for me- watch your back around Miyamoto's boss -she'll get you, and I actually understood most of the story- would have even in the original Japanese (which I don't speak at all).

The fight/ action scenes were very interesting visually, not as badly overacted as some Asian stuff I've seen. The FX were good too, although I had never seen bullets zinging by a person before. The corniest thing I saw was the way the Deegra fighting gear looked- about all I could think of were the Transformers toys/ cartoons, which are also Japanese. Interesting how when a car blows up in this movie it doesn't just go BOOM!,it also jumps straight up many feet.

It's an Asian movie so you see very few non-Asians, all in the future Tibet sequence. I think there were 12 or 18(?) cast names listed, in English, in the closing credits, with a very few other names in other capacities.

At one point Milly promises to come back and help/save Miyamoto, interesting the way that is shown.

I found the dubbing to look unusually good for a dubbed movie, it worked better that the subtitling- who ever did that evidently did not do the dubbing. The music seemed very western to me, even in the closing credits, but I noticed that a Lenny Kravitz piece was listed, in English, so maybe it's all original.

I was happier with this one than most of the Asian movies I've seen, a lot better than some of the dubbed Jackie Chan stuff.",1105660800,,1917,4.4756446991404015

Nothing in it seemed like any other movie I have ever seen, at least not noticably. The story behind it is great, and the actors have great talent. It does remind me of an anime, but if it were an anime, I doubt that it would be as good. With anime, you can make anything happen, but with live action your limited to what you can make the actors, and computers do. This movie had awesome special effects, and if you watch the extras about the sfx in the special features, you will be amazed by how they transformed, nothing into aliens, and spaceships.

I liked this movie.  The effects were nice, not too in your face like Matrix and the ""action"" scenes were much better.

I phrase it as ""action"" because they stress it as just that in the movie.  Takeshi Kaneshiro's character does a flip kick in the movie and it looks believable.  I never compared this movie to that other one I mentioned until writing this review just now, how odd, hehe.  Of all the things that make this movie better, it's plot is even better...in that same believability vein.  This one doesn't stink ""silly"" like the other ;p.

It has a nice touch of everything.  In a cold world of machines and gangs there are still those that will give of themselves for others.  To me there was also this element of trust, from both main characters.  Watch it and you'll see what I mean.  That part I liked.

But the hideout is discovered and all is almost lost when a young, and untrained, woman jumps through the time gate to our present.

Although untrained as a soldier, she does know the basics of the mission.  An alien ship will crash and the occupant needs to be killed before it can start the invasion.  It seems simple enough except that future knowledge is not completely accurate.  The ship has already crashed and the occupant has been taken away.  Now with the help of a local criminal trying to go straight, she must fight harder than she knows to give humanity a future.

Good action, some nice plot twists, and a time paradox or two all combine to make an old plot seem fresh.  I bought this one based on a trailer on another DVD and I was not disappointed.  The film is fairly intelligent and the hero is wonderfully resourceful, desperate, and caring.  Her character does not fall apart as she unravels what is going on and what she must do to stop it.

2353886,5,B000A2V8AO,"Ok, i'll start off like this...if your reading the other reviews, hopefully you checked mine out at some point so you can get a better concept of this movie.

  FIRST: The common statement is ""this"" movie copies such movies as Matrix, Terminator etc. Not true, a movie isn't ever usually COPYING a movie in the first place...they just get ideas from one thing or another. With that said, Matrix and such movies get there ideas from Anime and such...not the other way around.  So when you read the smart reviews by others which say this is one of the best all around asian movies (yes it actually has an interesting story and plot to it) they're right!

  SECOND: If your into heroic movies, if you enjoy watching the characters who are what you wish you can be and are into...this is the movie for you.

  THIRD:  This movie really is great all around. The actors are as good as it gets. When you see them, you feel for them and pretty much like them instantly. They play there characters perfectly.  I know as everyone mentions, the idea of going back in time isn't original and a couple of other things...but the ideas in the movie are perfect and what should be used. When i compare it to something, i think of Dragon Ball Z (when Trunks comes back in time to help Prevent a future problem) If you know what im talking about, its that concept. Which i think is great to see in a movie like this one.

Im into Martial Arts myself, at first i thought it was gonna be just a cool action fighting movie...it really isn't that. Its an awesome movie that involves the look and feel from Anime (sense of humor, the heart of hero's, the looks) The movie has very impressive special effects (not the types you see in many asian movies) When there are battles, it involves Martial Arts...but it isn't a fight'em up movie.  I did watch it in english and i thought it was really good, but it is true that sometimes movies can look and be abit cheesy when dubbed in english..i didn't think so with this,  but either way you can change it to whatever you want on DVD.
  All in all, if you like Anime, Sci Fi, asian movies or anything thats really good...check this movie out!!!",1103068800,,2166,4.388471177944862
2353887,4,B000A2V8AO,"I admit that the majority of Japanese action movies I've seen have been a confusing mix of fight scenes without a lot of plot. Thankfully this movie defies the trend and though it has a fluffy plot, still remains enjoyable and is well made.

Anne Suzuki is Milly, sent from the future to prevent an apocalypse from aliens. She is paired up with Miyimoto, a handsome young gunman who has a sweet side in addition to being dangerous with a weapon. Together they attempt to keep a crime lord from killing an alien and return it to its family.

This movie is really a send up of just about every famous sci-fi movie in the past few decades, yet it still remains fresh and enjoyable. Miyimoto, played by the stunning Takeshi Kaneshiro, is really a live action anime character, tough attitude hiding a sweet heart, brightly colored hair streaks, and volatile temper included. He even has the perfect good looks of an anime male. Anne Suzuki is adorable and sweet as Milly. The CGI actually is pretty advanced and the aliens echo back to E.T.

Each character's voice matches his/her character nicely. Millie is young yet hardened by a life of war. Myamoto is tough and macho yet hides a sensetive side. The villain Mizoguchi is someone you'll love to hate. And the old woman, Shaw, is alot of fun. And finally, the story makes sense. It's not like some Asian action films I've seen that seem to be mostly just a bunch of action scenes thrown together, and for a movie about time travel it makes alot more sense than most of the ones I've seen.

2353889,5,B000A2V8AO,"People say Returner copies ideas from other movies, but in this age of unoriginality (which movies is Hollywood remaking or making crappy sequels to this year?), the least that can be said is that it does a fine job of representing ideas from other movies.

The title is original, though, it's one of those Japanese-made-up English words:  RI-TAA-NAA.  I think it's derived from the idea that Milly (Suzuki An) ""returns"" to the past, and is therefore The Returner (even though the posters make it look like Kaneshiro Takeshi's character is The Returner).

I used to be one of those people who hates watching subtitles, but after watching dozens of Hong Kong films, I've gotten used to it, so I watched Returner first in the original Japanese, then in dubbed English.  I must say that the English dub sucks.  They tried TOO HARD to stretch English dialog over slow moments of Japanese lip movement, and the English voice acters didn't sound like they cared at all about the characters they played.  (The leads sounded goofy and the old woman always sounded like she was on her death bed.)

What this movie lacks in originality it makes up for in music, production, special effects and acting. (Yes I said acting!) There is a very strange pace to the whole movie, as any westerner that has ever watched a japanese film will notice, but it makes it all the more interesting. Overall a great movie that will give any hollywood production a run for it's money! Oh, and do yourself a favor and watch this movie in it's original japanese language with english subtitles on... it makes a BIG difference in the overall feel of the movie.

2353891,4,B000A2V8AO,"This is one cheesy sci-fi movie that is uncanny interesting and entertaining.  My mind went numb and became observant when I watched such unorthodox screenwriting.  Many other reviewers are comparing the ""Returner"" to the like of Americans' movies of the ""Matrix"" or ""Terminator"" which is somewhat only proportional true.  Maybe the plot wasn't too original, time-traveling to save the past, but the style and flow fair more favorable to an Anime style.  Japanese's' acting and culture is somewhat profoundly different from Western's culture.

The acting in this movie even with the goofy storyline and characters' role was actually good and believable.  You got the prototypical Japanese female star character, Anne in this case, that is reservedly spoken, seamlessly helplessly defenseless, but featuring some unique superpower. She possesses a time forcing mechanism.  The typical male character, Takeshi, is a gung ho cowboy-like loner with mad combat skill.  The Villains providing most of the cheesy factor were comically evil.

The industrial and science lab scenes were fairly detail and enticing.  The CG was pretty cool with a mechanical dragon alien that look like Sky Lynx.  Even though the movie has a tint to it; the film quality was not great, a little grainy.

Without analyzing too much and overlooking cultural acting style, the ""Returner"" is an entertaining movie for the open-minded.  I would not mine buying this movie when the price drops some, because it was interestingly different.",1091923200,,1506,5.330508474576271

But if you're looking at Returner, you're already probably thinking ""Hong Kong action flick"" (or something close to it), saying Returner is a Rip-off is like saying Bruce Lee was ""just another martial artist"". Now on to the review.

This is a great, funny, cool action flick. Only a few points really need to be addressed...

-The main characters are lovable, and heroic but flawed, perfect for this movie.

-The enemies are super-ultra-chique and mega-cool. Yes, there's a lot of cheese in there, and it's the same in the movie. But again, it's perfect for the film.

-All of the action is superbly done, with a few technology-driven scenes that will really blow your mind. These special effects put most of Hollywood to shame. One bit toward the end truly becomes on of those ""wow"" moments, when you wonder why movies like this aren't destroying American cinema.

-The story is convoluted, but not so much that it takes away from the story. Follow just enough to know what's going on, and this will be a blast.

-The few scenes with ""downtime"" often involve a tiny bit of romance between the male and female lead. It's defnately nothing that's going to annoy the action buffs, but it would be just enough to score points with the opposite sex. An action flick with an iota of romance? Bonus.

To sum up Returner: Fun, fun, fun. Get some snacks, and maybe grab your signifigant other, and enjoy it. Definately worth a second viewing.",1091836800,,1542,4.667896678966789
2353907,5,B000A2V8AO,"The review on this title says that it is unoriginal.  In defense of this there is a long list of movies such as Matrix and Terminator to which it is supposedly similar.

  First, that is completely backwards.  American movies, PARTICULARLY The Matrix, have been ruining a genre perfected by the Japanese and Chinese, by poorly copying it's style and paying tons of money to get Asian stars and then writing crumby movies for them.  Most of the movies on that list wouldn't exist if it weren't for Asian Sci-Fi/Action and Anime.

  Second, this film is derivative in the same way The Maltese Falcon was derivative.

  Third, if you don't love Sci-Fi and/or Asian films, you are watching the wrong movie.  But don't worry, Legally Blonde is finally available in widescreen.",1090886400,,771,4.838461538461538
2353908,3,B000A2V8AO,"Go ahead and judge this movie by its cover.  Looks like a lot of other recent sci-fi/action flicks, doesn't it?  Guy in a trenchcoat, posing with a gun, lesser female character in the background, numbers rolling down behind them...  Looks like the Matrix.  Looks like Equlibrium.  It isn't too far off.
  Actually, ""The Returner"" borrows more from ""The Terminator"" trilogy than anything else.  It actually borrows too much.  The story is exactly the same.  In ""The Returner"" a war is being waged in the future against a race of aliens, and a girl must travel back to the present time to stop the war from ever beginning.  Sounds a lot like a certain series starring Arnold Schwarzenneger, does it not?
  The girl even brings back a gadget from the future - a wristband - that allows a charcater wearing it to travel twenty times faster than everyone else for a brief period of time.  This, as you might expect, allows for a few ""Bullet-time"" scenes, with enemies and bullets traveling in super slowmotion, while our heroes dodge the bullets with fancy acrobatic techniques.  Seen it before, but it still looks cool.
  ""The Returner"" is a special effects filled sci-fi/action flick, that gives viewers exactly what they'll expect.  It has likable characters, an interesting ending, and is only slightly hurt by its lack of real originality.

The movie is a blender of the E.T., Matrix, ID4, Terminator and Back to the Future.  Nothing original, everything is exactly mediocre and rehashed. The wire work is OK, the gunplay pretty good, the acting bad to mediocre. The bad part is the dubbed English or were they real American actors?

SOUND: It made good use of 5.1 DD sound. The voices and effects were clear and traveled among the speakers without any breaks.
EXTRAS: This is the best part of the DVD. They show a split screen of before and after shots of special effects.

It's a good one to watch when you're already committed to wasting time. There are lots worse out there - but lots better, too.",1079395200,,590,4.737864077669903
2353937,3,B000A2V8AO,"Returner had great special effects and some pretty cool action sequences, albeit some were so obviously stolen from other movies.
I mean, c'mon, if you can't notice that so blatantly, you are blind.  But it also had a great look to it, with very different and interesting special effects.  That's what made this movie!!
The plot has been done, and this one still has some great ideas and unexpected twists and turns - all the way to the very end!
And that's a plus.  It showed me that this director stretched to at least make an above-average B-movie.  And he did.
The acting was not as bad as a lot of other Asian movies I've seen, but still was not as greatly acted as movies such as - Hero with Jet Li, Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon, ALIVE, directed by Ryhuei Kitamura, who also did the Azumi 3-hour epic and the somewhat lame VERSUS.  Alive was a much better film by far.  Good luck finding it.
But RETURNER, though worth watching for it's special effects, comes up short in some facets.  (the slow-time action sequences are done the best!)  The acting is Ok, but some of the dialogue and storyline lack far behind other Asian films.  But it is a step above the many I've seen thus far.
But MUSA, THE WARRIOR, is by far the best acted and action Hong Kong movie ever!  Hands down.  See it, you'll see what I mean.
It's like the Asian story of their own The ALAMO.  Awesome setting, acting, and action of such film giants as BRAVEHEART.
But Returner had some very uniqueness about it, thus saving it from mediocor film making.",1079136000,,1529,4.48014440433213
2353938,4,B000A2V8AO,"This movie is so interesting and varied, playing kind of like live action anime almost.  I have no idea why, but I was sucked into it about 10 minutes after it started.  Unlike some other recent live action movies from Japan, this one has a decent storyline and great special effects, with the telltale humor at the right spots.  Watching it in English is actually not that bad, as the dub job is really good.  Watching it in original Japanese with English subs is, of course, much better.",1078099200,,489,4.5227272727272725
2353939,3,B000A2V8AO,"Despite all of the references to other movies.  This is a really good film.  It lacked alot of action, but the cinematagrophy and the villian made up for that.  The bad guy in this movie has a sort of Joker from Batman appeal.",1078099200,,226,4.209302325581396
2353940,3,B000A2V8AO,"I was expecting an action film from what I had gathered from other reviews saying it was like Terminator and Matrix, but that's pretty far off. The story has elements taken from those films but what disappointed me in Returner was the lack of action. There are some action scenes but they are far and in between most of the film which is talkie. I think there is probably less than 10 minutes of actual action in the entire 2 hours. The effects are pretty good for the most part, some are a little flawed though and some of the dialouge is cartoony and overstated. Overall, I enjoyed the film but just barely. I expected to be entertained by action and hardly found any. The lead characters are enjoyable and that is probably what makes this film only slightly above average. I'd advise you to rent this one before you buy. Just keep in mind that your main reason for watching this film will be for the story that kind of takes parts from a bunch of other blockbusters but doesn't transfer the action along with them.",1077926400,,1017,4.44385026737968
2353941,4,B000A2V8AO,"I first saw previews for this film while watching the Sci-Fi channel, and needless to say, I was interested. The user reviews on this website are much more true to the film than the critic's reviews.
  I found this film to be very exciting to watch. It combined a well-thought plot, superb acting (minus most of the english speaking characters from the future), creative cinematography, smooth special effects, and fun all into a nice package.
  I also agree with the reviews here: Who cares if it takes elements from other movies? Lot's of movies do that. The first Charlie's Angels (a horrid film) completely ripped from The Matrix and M:I 2. So much that it was worthless to even watch, mainly because it was ripped so poorly. Furthermore, while most people consider The Matrix the proprietor of showing the bullets, one should recall Face/Off. John Woo showed bullets coming out of the guns during a showdown scene near the end of the feature. And yet, Matrix gets the credit for it.
  This movie does combine elements of other films, but it does so without losing it's own identity. This is an excellent Japanese film and should be viewed by any fan of action, import, anime, or just plain fun.
  Also check out ""Versus"" directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Do yourself a favor and watch the Director's Cut version rather than the completely dumbed down R version. It's a whole different beast!",1077753600,,1391,4.766666666666667
2353942,4,B000A2V8AO,"As anyone can see, this is the Terminator, the Matrix, Back to the Future, Independence Day, and a bit of Miyazaki Hayao all rolled into one, and none the worse for that. Some of the lines are bit saccharine to my taste, and to be sure, there is nothing arty about the film. But faced with a film of this nature, it is not a good idea to set up a counil of perfection. It is a hugely entertainintg work in its own right. I even think it is better than Independence Day or Armageddon.",1077580800,,483,4.094736842105263
2353943,4,B000A2V8AO,"I purchased this movie expecting a cheesy film with bad acting like most recent Japanese live-action movies. I also expected a movie that borrowed heavily from other movies. But this really wasn't either one of those movies, at least not more than any other movie out of Hollywood.
Others have already reviewed this movie (girl goes back in time to save the human race), so I won't spend any more time on it.
The acting wasn't bad at all, especially Ann Suzuki's sometimes-serious, sometimes-rebellious character, Milly. The dubbing was also done well -- it was actually worth listening to.  The CG and special effects were very good and imaginative, contributing to the plot. The soundtrack was a little inconsistent, and some of the camerawork was kind of strange, but nothing too distracting.
All in all, this movie stands on its own as a good sci-fi movie. It won't compare to older movies by Kurosawa, and it isn't as refined as many recent science fiction movies from the U.S. (although much better than Roland Emmerich's Godzilla), but it's still not bad by any stretch.",1077062400,,1077,4.885245901639344
2353944,4,B000A2V8AO,"I really, really love this film!  The plot was complex, as were the characters. there wre twists and grey areas not normally seen in kung fu films.  Both the lead actors did a superb job, as did the supporting characters.  It was interesting, absorbing, and entertaining.  A must buy.",1076976000,,284,4.73469387755102
2353945,4,B000A2V8AO,"Returner is a pleasent diversion, a little brainless at times, but overall it is very well done. The special effects are pretty good and there are some great wild action scenes in this film. This is essentially a John Woo film with a few Sci-Fi elements thrown in, but it all works out.",1076803200,,286,4.415094339622642
2353946,3,B000A2V8AO,"This is one of those movies that looks great in the trailer but after viewing in its entirety leaves your expectations unfulfilled.
The story involves a young girl from an alien invaded Earth of the future who travels back in time to destroy the first of those aliens in an attempt to save humanity.  Once in the past she meets an expert fighter whose out to avenge the murder of a childhood friend who was kidnapped in front of him by a vile gangster who apart from kidnapping, killing, and selling human organs wants to rule mankind using the powers of the same alien that the girl is after.  Can she convince the expert fighter she's really from the future and that if she fails her mission Earth is doomed?  Will destroying the alien save humanity or will it cause more death and destruction?  Can the two heroes team up to stop the murderous kidnapper from using extra-terrestial powers he doesn't understand?  You'll find out the answers to all this (and not much more) if you watch RETURNER.
Unfortunately after seeing a promising trailer, RETURNER turns out to be just another average post mid-90s Hong Kong style action flick (even though it's a Japanese production).  The computer-generated special effects are adequate enough (though they LOOK computer-generated, but that seems the norm for most special effects movies these days), but the science fiction elements never develop into anything more than creating a nonstandard background for a standard action story to take place upon.  The actors never display a real sense of awe or surprise at all the incredible alien events that are taking place around them.  They simply take things as they come, as if such events are just normal everyday occurances.  The head villain even makes ludicrous demands to an alien baby while holding it at gun point as if it's convenience store cashier.
The film is best described as a below average crime caper made a little more interesting by mixing in some basic sci-fi, some average action sequences, and some on par special effects.
Now for the film's most significant rip-offs.  The alien looks exactly like a baby E.T. and like E.T. he is left behind on Earth and starts to get sick.  There's THE TERMINATOR storyline where someone goes back in time to change history and stop an invasion.  They even steal a scene from BACK TO THE FUTURE 3 where the hero survives a bullet due to a little help and foresight gained from a future newspaper clipping.  THE MATRIX is in evidence throughout with the flowing jackets and the supernormal speed tricks of the camera.  And in true GI JOE cartoon style, the bad guys can't hit the broadside of a barn (though they CAN hit something as small as a little metal protective plate when worn by the hero, and their boss does have great aim shooting his own people when they get on his nerves!)
What works best in this picture is the chemistry of the male and female protagonists.  The actors really give off a sense that they care about eachother.  The alien special effects, again while obviously computer generated, are sufficiently competent and do at least provide something out of the ordinary to look at in an otherwise by the numbers action flick.
Overall, this is just an average action picture made to look like more than it is, and as such is not recommended for those
expecting any type of groundbreaking science fiction.  It is, however, still of slight recommendation due to the fact that it's an okay action movie with nice special effects.  On that note, you might want to give it a try.",1076630400,,3543,4.733333333333333
2353957,5,B000A2V8AO,"I just finished watching this movie and let me tell you I am quite impressed.  Especially after reading all the so called ""movie critic"" reviews of this movie.  You know, I have had enough with the stupidity and hypocrisy of your average critic and I am not going to even bother anymore with reading what they have to say about a given movie.  It has become obvious to me that a good majority of them are so concerned about what it is fashionable to say or what they think other critics think they should say that any chance of them giving a sincere and open minded look at a movie seems completely impossible.  And you know what is the fashionable thing to say about this movie?  That it is derivative, that it is only an amalgam of ripped-off ideas from other movies.
Take for example the Amazon.com editorial review above which says that ""there's not a single original idea in Returner...combining elements of The Matrix, E.T., The Terminator and Independence Day, plus a dash of Back to the Future"".  This is basically a carbon copy of what nearly every wanna-feel-important movie critic on the net is writing about this movie (so who is being derivative here?). But I ask them, how is it any more derivative than the movies that they list as being ripped-off? Or any other movie for that matter.  By the impossibly high standards with which they have obviously judged this movie ALL MOVIES would have to be considered derivative.  'Independence Day' becomes no more than a rehash of 'War of the Worlds' and 'Back to the Future' a rehash of 'The Time Machine' and so on and so forth.  This is ridiculous.  They are obviously being unfair to this movie.  Yes it does contain elements from the movies mentioned, as well as elements from a thousand other movies, but so what?  The same is true of every movie that has ever been made.  But this movie is far from being a blatant rip-off, it presents many new ideas as well as some fresh perspectives on some old ones.  Overall I found Returner to be a nicely balanced and enjoyable film.  It has loads of style, amazing action sequences, an interesting plot, characters you care about and some very amazing special effects.  I recommend that you don't listen to what the ""critics"" have to say (ever) and watch this movie with a fresh and unbiased mind.  I am sure most of you will enjoy it.",1076371200,,2340,4.559808612440191

2353959,5,B000A2V8AO,"Honestly, I never expected this movie to turn out so good. It enraptures you from the start and has a well written and even better acted out story. Even though it has been said that this movie is Matrix-esque, the feeling will pass as soon as you notice that these characters and story stand on their own feet well enough, and with a solid ending, no extremely obvious loose ends or loop-holes, and best of all, no sprinkle-in-a-sex-scene rubbish this is THE movie to see next friday night.

2353960,5,B000A2V8AO,"Takeshi Kaneshiro, a Japanese and Hong Kong action star does a great job as a mysterious assassin of mobsters.  This is a cool movie with great special effects, and good gun fighting sequences.  It does borrow from the ""Matrix"" look with the black outfit and the black coat... but it doesn't take away from the movie's unique take on the genre.  This movie is made in Japan, and mostly presented in the Japanese language (with some Mandarin and English), so hopefully the integrity of the soundtrack would be preserved when shown in the United States.  This has a ship load of special effects.  It has space ships, commercial airplanes transforming into giant robotic beings, air planes, and it has space aliens.  This movie deals with time travel, war with invading race of space aliens, Japanese triads, government cover-ups, and guns.  Overall the movie works for me in many levels, and I recommend action fans to check it out.",1068076800,,930,4.848101265822785
