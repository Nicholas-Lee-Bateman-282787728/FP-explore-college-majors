8674435,3,B00MS8ZRP0,"Honestly, I was a bit disappointed.  Knowing very little about probiotics and wanting to learn a lot more, I found this to basically leave me where I started, a beginner.  If you know nothing about probiotics and want to be encouraged, this may be a good place to start.  They seem to have left out the basics of why? how? how much? what kind? It is VERY repetitive.  Best part was hearing Nimoys voice.  Good Luck.",1413417600,,415,4.407894736842105

health plus all the special bonus features makes ""MicroWarriors"" a winner! I would definitely recommend
this film to anyone who has an interest in beneficial bacteria.",1408320000,,253,5.512820512820513
