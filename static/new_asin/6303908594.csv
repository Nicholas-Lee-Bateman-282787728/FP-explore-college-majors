7855692,4,6303908594,"Okay, I'm coming from a different angle.  Of course I loved this film, Yamato junkie that I am.  The only thing is that Kodai's character nagged at me through the entire thing.  If I were Yuki, I would have dumped his space ace butt a while before this film takes place.  His mind doesn't seem to be in one place for any of it, which is good in a sense as it enables him to connect Teresa's message with the Comet Empire.  He can command a cargo ship but forgets he's getting married in three days?  He conveniently forgets that, uh, Yuki is a member of Yamato's crew as well?  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say it's a little over the top as far as melodrama goes.  Kodai aside, this film showcases how the characters have matured since the first film.  Naturally, the animation is top notch, especially those launch sequences at which Matsumoto excelled.  This is a must for Yamato fans, and highly recommended for anime lovers.",1052438400,,936,4.421052631578948
7855693,4,6303908594,"`Farewell to S.B. Yamato', the second `Yamato' movie (and the introduction of the Comet Empire) was originally intended to be the conclusion of the saga, and featured the killing off of most of the beloved characters, as well as a few of the ones we love to hate (none of whom I'll disclose). Fortunately, the popularity of this film eventually led to its adaptation and expansion on the small screen as the second `Yamato' series. In fact, there are a few moments from `Farewell...' that were shown in the original Japanese `Comet Empire' TV series, but were ultimately cut from the American `Star Blazers' adaptation. This includes Saito (Sgt. Knox) shooting & killing a Comet Empire tank commander at point-blank range, the deaths (for the second time) of a few of our beloved stalwarts, and a few other things that were covered up stateside.
I've found the `Yamato/Star Blazers' series & flicks remarkably slow-paced compared to latter-day anime fare, and `Farewell...' is a good example of this. Much like the overly-long special-fx sequences in `Star Trek: The Motion Picture', this particular entry has a few maddeningly-long visuals. The approaching comet at the movie's opening is a good example of my need to hit the fast-forward button. But aside from this little nit, I find it refreshing to watch an anime feature that doesn't have the action-laden moments just whiz by, or feature those dizzying blur-line backdrops. Mellow anime... who'da thunk it?
Fair warning: be sure to grab the subtitled rendition of this movie. The dubbed release is a half-hour shorter, and the dub's not all that great.
