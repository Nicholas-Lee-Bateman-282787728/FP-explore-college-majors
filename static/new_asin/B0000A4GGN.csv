8249798,3,B0000A4GGN,"Ordered the PAL DVD for use in Australia. Unfortunately was sent an NTSC 1 (USA) region DVD. Apparently incorrect details on the website. However, the response to this mistake has been very prompt and fair.
Feedback is no PAL region DVD's are available.",1322956800,,253,4.906976744186046
8249799,4,B0000A4GGN,"If you really like house music. Buy this now!! The Hifi- 2 channel stereo mix is superb with headphones. If you like the Bargrooves cds or Cafe Del Mar Chillhouse CDs you should like this. This is the true apartment dwellers escape to house music with video. Also check out Cream The DVD.

Happy listening",1161043200,,305,4.545454545454546
8249800,1,B0000A4GGN,"I expected to see the music videos from the Ministry of Sound annual, but it's just a long mix with a bunch of computer images going across the screen. You can also choose watching a bunch of people at Ibiza dancing to the music. If you're into this then it's cool.",1111968000,2,265,4.215686274509804
8249801,1,B0000A4GGN,"WOW ! I can`t believe I actually dropped $33.00 on this DVD. I should have known because most of Ministry`s products are commercial and chessy. I just ordered 6 DVD`s from Amazon and this is by far the worst. Total rip-off. If you want to see a great DVD, pick up the ATB or the Tiesto. This is the last time i`m buying anything with the Ministry logo on it.",1065139200,5,358,4.128571428571429
