7920000,5,6303998577,"Guyver is an EXCELLENT anime series. After viewing the live movies a few years ago I became hooked. I have watched vol. 2 and I can't wait to get the whole series!! The animation is pretty good considering it was done in 1989. I mean would you go to a video store and rent a black/white sci-fi movie from the 60s and expect it to look like the prequel to ""The Matrix""? I think not! Anyway, in this vol. Guyver 2 makes his first appearance and boy does he look down right awesome! The action scene is incredible as Guyver 1 (the hero) and Guyver 2 go at it! And for those that are new to this series there are 3 Guyver units. I'm not going to spoil it for ya but you won't regret it if you get this video.
One thing that I really hate is that there are only 30 min episodes on each tape. Once you really get hooked on the episode the next thing you know it's over. So I think it's best to just get the whole series since there's only 12. I suggest this video for ages 16 and over. There is a lot of violence and blood in this anime. For example it's not unusual for Guyver to tear off an arm and crush a skull or two (very bloody). But for the mature audience this anime rocks. Get the whole series I know I will!",1003104000,3,1212,3.971311475409836
7920001,5,6303998577,If you're a fan of the series up till now this is a great continuation.  In this Sho learns that Chronos Japan was just the tip of the iceberg and  that the ruthlessness of Commander Rehote Guyo is nothing compared to that  of Professor Hameril Valcus the new leader.  Great fight sceens and new  allies show up in the last episodes of the series.  Buy this if you don't  have it.  Its worth the $11.99.,965174400,2,403,4.28
7920002,4,6303998577,The Guyver series is quite possibly one of the best animes every written.  The complete story line is so originial that no one has even come up with a worthy substitute.  I would recommend this series to anyone.,944352000,5,211,4.526315789473684
