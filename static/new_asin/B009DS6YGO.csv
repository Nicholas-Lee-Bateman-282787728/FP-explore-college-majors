5320947,5,B009DS6YGO,"I have been informed the new, pre order is for 3 new titles which will come out mid to late 2013.  The titles in the description are incorrect as I already have them.  Giving Foyle's War 5 stars as it is one of my favorite series and happy to know it is continuing, at least for 3 more episodes.",1352937600,19,295,3.983050847457627
5320948,5,B009DS6YGO,This series has been available for at least a year in DVD and Blu-ray formats being for sale in the ABC shop and discount stores. At the time I did check on amazon.com and amazon.co.uk and it was not available. Given the UK and Australia are region B for Blu ray distribution it should have been available in the UK at least. The show its self is well worth watching as it deals with the end of WW2 finishes with a cliffhanger as Foyle departs for the US.,1352764800,6,455,4.181818181818182

5320950,5,B009DS6YGO,The series stands for itself in British Television quality in acting and production of this World War II Mystery series. It would be nice for Amazon or Acorn to let prospective buyers know how many episodes are included and perhaps total running time ? It might be helpful in selling it.,1352505600,208,287,4.647058823529412
5320951,5,B009DS6YGO,My wife and I watch Masterpiece Theater Movies often and BBC productions too.

5320955,5,B009DS6YGO,"An excellent show.  When the Brits are good, they are very, very good!  Excellent performances by the actors.  The show is also interesting for American audiences because of its up-close-and-personal view of the war.",1507161600,,216,5.294117647058823

5320972,5,B009DS6YGO,The Foyle's War series is among our favorites and we've enjoyed watching the episodes over again several times over the years.  Very well written and acting is superb. Set 7 and Set 8 after the war are not quite as well put together as series 6 was though.  But we still enjoyed them all.,1484092800,,288,4.314814814814815

5320983,3,B009DS6YGO,"With this set, Christopher Foyle transitions from police work to working for the Intelligence Services.

If you want to know more about what happens with Sam and her husband, then, by all means get the final three sets (7-9).  It is also interesting to learn more about Mildred Pierce over the final three sets.

But, having said that, I just didn't find this quite as interesting as seasons 1-5. I've been thinking about why this is, and offer the following:

1) Without Milner in the mix, the the chemistry just isn't what it used to be.
2) The clarity of justice is far more muddied; working for the Intelligence Services, it is harder to tell who is right and who is wrong. This reason is probably the major ones. The new shows are more depressing than getting a feeling of justice done.  It was satisfying to see Foyle arrest the wrongdoer. It was satisfying to see the ""bad guy"" caught... but I get no such satisfaction from any of the shows in the sets 7-9.
3) I didn't care for the new opening as much

Let me add that there were still some fun and good moments throughout; it's not all bad -- thus, the three-star rating instead of one. But none of the new shows holds a candle to my all-time favorite, The While Feather (season 1, #2) - the show dealing with Dunkirk was excellent.

Another minor point: I was very shocked and unhappy when the character of Sam first appeared in the first show... the bubbly, happy person was withdrawn and sour... it turns out that there was a reason for this and it turns around, but for a re-introduction, I remember thinking ""If this is how Sam will be as a married woman, I don't think I want to watch this"".

I'm a huge fan of Foyle's War, seasons (or sets) 1-5, but once was enough for this set.  I didn't even bother to purchase season 8 or 9 - I watched them on streaming to know what would happen, but I really wasn't motivated to purchase them.",1471824000,3,1898,4.369318181818182

5320988,5,B009DS6YGO,"Hands down, Foyle's War is my most favorite British TV show, and I have now watched quite a few. I was very sad when we got to the end of the series.  The last two seasons, I think season 7 and 8, were set just after WWII. They were my least favorite seasons.  However, the rapport between the characters and the stories that were done were so interesting. The characters are so human and funny and caring for each other. If this is your only British show to watch, you will enjoy it.",1464825600,,484,4.193548387096774
5320989,5,B009DS6YGO,"Great having Foyle back, although I don't think Horowitz should be so obsessed with keeping things in strict chronological order.  I would have been happy to see more mysteries set in the World War II time frame.  Also, they should have brought Milner back.  The three were a team.",1464220800,,281,4.6938775510204085

5321039,5,B009DS6YGO,"We are currently revisiting the first seven seasons in preparation of the release of Season Eight. One indication of a work's greatness is that however often you visit it, it strikes you with new colors and insights. Imagine watching a mystery you've watched four times before and forgetting you know how it comes out. Actually, not paying attention to the fact of the mystery in favor of enjoying the characters and how they grow. Sam grows up right before our eyes. It's intriguing to watch Mickael Kitchen act with the mere flick of an eyebrow or cheek that is more eloquent than Olivier in full stride. I marvel at how well Anthony Horowitz can pack so much into an hour and a half. Can he really make time stop? He must have apprenticed in a sardine cannery.",1440460800,,763,4.576642335766423

5321128,5,B009DS6YGO,"Growing up, I had World War 2 for breakfast.  The easiest way to get out of Saturday morning chores was to ask my English war bride mother resettled in America to tell us stories about her younger years. These story mornings affected me profoundly and nurtured a life long appreciation of the struggles involved. The historical elements I see inFoyles War certainly parallel what  I saw and heard first and second hand. Visits to my English family in the '50s in Great Yarmouth, another coastal town, saw bombing debris not yet cleared
away, the horrors of the war lingering then when an uncle was blown up helping to clear mines from the beaches of Caister, and the
food parcels I recall my mother sending to her own mother as the food shortages continued. This series brought it all back to me. I find
Michael Kitchens to be a master of the micro expressions about which I taught my psychology students, While I might have wished for
the thematic war years to have been more thoroughly explored,still life goes on, and these characters do too. I did not have as much
difficulty making the transition to the MI5/6 genre as I might have anticipated. These characters have been allowed to mature, and
while their personalities remain constant, their perspectives do change,

5321209,2,B009DS6YGO,"4 words...""He talks too much..."" Ok, I have seen and reviewed previous seasons so I really have enjoyed this series....until now...After waiting an eternity to get this on DVD, all I can say is...meh!  The 3 characters that originally made this series what it was are either not here, are changed to the point of being unrecognizable or as is the case with Foyle, totally different.  No I didn't expect Foyle to be unchanged by the War, but like I opened up this review with the words ""he talks too much"" is a true assessment...Previously you could just look at Foyle and see his mind working and know when he ""got it"".....Now, that wonderful way he was has been replaced by something that is a mix of old X-files music; Midsommer Murders perverted people (why does that one guy HAVE to be interested in men who dress up as women????) and Samantha's character is a brooding housewife who does a very bad ""I Love Lucy""-ish portrayal of ""helping"" her husband in politics...Not to mention they replaced her original hubby with an even more dull and seemingly ancient character.....I wish somebody would please learn how to light that woman---she has looked terrible since the last couple of episodes!!!! I haven't seen such bad lighting on a woman since Donna Reed took over the role of JRs mother on Dallas!  I don't think most Foyle fans care whether the series takes place in a place with gorgeous scenery since that is not why we watched it to begin with; but for some reason that was a ""big deal"" with this production.  I also really missed ""Milner""---his character (IMHO) was an integral part of the team and a good writer could have incorporated it.  Mr. Horowitz, you missed big time on this and I think you just need to retire Foyle if you are going to do more productions like this.....I enjoy watching Mr. Kitchen in many things; but even this was just not ""Foyle"" to me....",1422921600,,1882,4.622754491017964

5321251,3,B009DS6YGO,"We really enjoy this British series in our US home.  A major drawback is there have been no included captions built-in - up to season 5 - you are required to use the caption option that comes with your TV, and we're finding that most US tv's these days, are requiring you to use the captions provided by your DVD or cable service.  Major FAIL!  Seasons 6 & 7 say SDH on the back, will have to see if that really works or choosing that option says ""use your TV subtitle option"".

But the REAL reason this exceptional series is getting only a 3-star review is that for an average of $30 per season - you get ONLY three episodes.  If they can create 12 Downton Abbey in the same time for about the same price, what's up with that?  This review will be essentially copy/paste into Foyle Season 6, too.  Same exact thing.

Foyle is a Detective Chief Superintendent (British ""Chief of Police"") in a town outside London during WWII.  The plots involve a death or murder, but besides the mystery the insight into wartime life in Great Britain is wonderful - I thought I knew most of the history, but I learn more more in every episode.  I have every episode and enjoy watching them periodically as I note another insight or plot twist that I failed to notice.  If you don't buy the DVDs, make sure to watch the series on BBC TV when it occ. shows.",1414886400,,599,4.36936936936937

5321353,5,B009DS6YGO,"Good drama, and has good factual history for the time it is set (around world war II and shortly thereafter).  We wish Sgt. Melner, and Folye's son Andrew would have lasted longer in the series, but it is good none-the-less. Sam's husband is a different character in series set 7, than is set 6. The former seems a more believable person that Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks) would fall in love with, but the later is a more believable character to run for parliament.  The first seasons are the best. Slowly going slightly down hill from there, but they are all well done and intriguing. Also Sgt. Melner's second wife changes actresses between 2 of the seasons (can't remember which). There is a season 8 being filmed now, so this is not the end of Foyle's War.",1413417600,,754,4.5777777777777775

As a retired history teacher and historian (well maybe we never really retire) I found the treatment of the attitudes of embattled Brits to be nicely done and accurate.  So it was with some curiosity I ordered the post-war season 7.  Mr. Kitchen continues with his subtly understated character as he begins to wend his way through Britain's post-war intelligence service.  Having grown up during this era in the US, I found the paranoia regarding Russian espionage to be accurately reflected and while some may criticize other characters as cardboard cutouts, they reflect many of the people of the times.  As I have come to expect from the first 6 sets, each story is masterfully written and keeps the viewer engaged throughout.

Mr. Kitchen plays a very intuitive sleuth whose penetrating insights border on the supernatural; but then how fun would it be to watch a defective detective befuddled and left scratching his head?  If they keep it up I'll keep watching.  I wish they had slowed the series down though.

With authenticity, great stories, full of suspense, drama, the human suffering of those in war and so affected at home. Foyles war takes you to the stories nobody thinks about.  Crimes, murder, the black market in a war torn country;they all fall to those entrusted police who, while not directly involved in the war can not properly investigate their crimes without stepping on the many toes of thosr with a lot of power to turn your investigation into a sham..Foyle has a patient, quiet way of bulldozing right to the very top, irritating many, he discovers it is not safe to.  For those of us in america it is amazing to see what war is like when it comes right down to your door step.

Sam (Samantha Stewart) is now married to a young man who is a rising star in politics but finds herself helping Foyle again. It's a whole different world for the former Detective Chief Inspector in a rapidly changing MI5 establishment where internal politics may be more important than the facts and have to be taken into account as Foyle tries to solve new types of cases.

And the way in which these stories have been constructed is absolutely beautiful, with surprises coming from around each corner.  I will admit that I liked the earler sets best, set during and just after WW11.  I miss Milner in these set set but so glad that Samantha is back.  It is my understanding that there will be more Foyle's War  episodes and that they are currently being filmed.  I hope he goes back to Hastings; a much lovelier setting than London.  The way is which a story of espionage is offset with a murder mystery (not necessarily, but sometimes often connected to each other) is absolutely brilliant and keeps you on your toes as you keep track of who is doing what and what their interests are and who would gain from certain actions or demises.  The truth is, I would watch anything with Michael Kitchen in it, but Foyle's War is one I have watched repeatedly over and over and will continue to do so.

Each program takes a particular true occurrence and uses it as the basis for a detective story.  The extras - background info and actor bios - show how much care the author took to keep as much authentic as possible.  It's wonderful how the actors grew in their parts and became that sergeant, driver, shopkeeper, government official.

5321607,4,B009DS6YGO,"I think my favorite things about Foyle, aside from his ethics, are that he is an able lawman, willing to actually do his job, which he does to the best of his ability. he is not lazy and so won't reach a conclusion out of convenience, but will actually work a case. He will investigate a crime to resolution no matter how high a status the perp has. the combination of high, but not preachy, moral standards and solid work ethic make him a very appealing character, one of my favorite fictitious police officers. It is true the 2 episodes I've so far seen are darker than earlier episodes, but the series is now set in a time of counter-intelligence and he now has several more layers of bureaucracy to navigate through, which doesn't appear to slow him down. great series. great actors.",1400025600,,787,4.510489510489511

Anything by Michael Kitchens but especially Det. Foyle is perfection in my book.  Sad that we in America have NOTHING that even comes close to good TV like this.  Between Downton Abbey, Foyle's War and Sherlock, the Brits have a lock on great TV.  The only complaint about this set and season is that there are only three episodes.

Foyle is a typically stoic Brit, but highly principled and extremely good at his job.  I find the characterizations to be well developed and the plots to be highly interesting and engaging.  On the negative side my need to see what was going to happen next calmed during the second season, primarily I think because some of the plots seemed to me to lack the level of authenticity to which I had become accustomed throughout the first season.

The writing, acting, and direction are of such high quality that after watching Season Seven (7) in its entirety, I immediately HAD to watch it again.  It's so simply good with three (3) ""nail-biting"" 90 minute espionage stories that had me ""on the edge of my chair"".

Season Seven (7) is set in London after world War two (2) has ended and the so-called ""Free World"" is about to enter the ""Cold War"" with its threat of everyone being ""blown to bits"" by a Nuclear bomb.  Series Seven (7) finds retired detective Foyle in retirement ready to go fishing when he is dragged back to work by the MI 5 counterintelligence gang to solve some espionage and counterintelligence mysteries.  Of course, Foyle, (superbly acted by Michael Kitchen) with his keen senses, solve greatly--he is so observant never missing a subtle clue. He recruits Sam (wonderfully acted by Honeysuckle Weeks) as his ""side kick"".  She is married to an up and coming politician.  Together they solve dastardly mysteries involving battles with Russian Spies willing to kill for ""secrets"" of the bomb, Nazis, lost and very irritable solders coming back to the ""home front"", double agents, team members with secrets, etc.

We are probably on the 12th run through of the magnificent series. It is excellent for young adults and high school age students to learn what went on in England during World War II. The writing is excellent, the casting is excellent, the music is excellent (notice especially the clarinet and the flute.)

5321763,5,B009DS6YGO,This has been one of the most enjoyable British series we have ever watched. Michael Kitchen's performance as Foyle has been outstanding from the first episode and it is just as good in the last. His ability to convey a thousand words with just one look is incredible. The story lines by Anthony Horowitz are terrific and it is a wonder he has not produced a series of Foyle books as well as his children and young adult books. This series can be stand alone but it is even more enjoyable with the benefits of the back stories. I hope honeysuckle weekes is ok as she did not look well in this series although it did not affect her acting but she is rather an accessory in all of the series. The ay the stories are weaned together is also a highlight please do another couple of series with Foyle continuing his role in post war intelligence - an intelligence office with decency and a conscience,1390348800,,895,4.397590361445783

Nonetheless, I was pretty unimpressed with the screenwriting (seemingly done by a recent film school grad) and direction. It was difficult to keep all the characters straight, and their motivations were pretty implausible. The ""who done it"" revelation at the end of at least one episode was cobbled together and silly. Also, you might want to skip the obligatory PC episodes.

5321788,5,B009DS6YGO,The British shows are far superior to any of American shows.  Foyle's war is one of the very best.  A calm and thoughtful character is refreshing.  The supporting cast is great also.,1388707200,,182,4.625

5321794,5,B009DS6YGO,"Foyle's  War is the most consistently excellent TV series to come out of Britain. The acting is superb, the historical context of each episode is carefully researched and documented (Making each episode a highly entertaining history lesson), the locations are knock outs, and the script writing is some of the best on TV. Michael Kitchen is astonishing. Just watch his face. The stories are often told in the subtle movements of his eyes and the barely visible shifts of emotion that cross his brow. The melodrama of Downton Abbey is still a favorite indulgence for me, but when I want to see taught, thought provoking drama and mystery, give me Foyle anytime.",1388448000,,660,4.892857142857143

5321800,1,B009DS6YGO,"Here's how you take an excellent show and ruin it.

1. Take Foyle away from the charming English town he lives in, remove him from his elegant house on a lovely street, and put him in the mean streets of London with litle to do except walk around in his long raincoat and interview people. (Just imagine Doc Martin without Port Isaac.)

2. Remove the recurring and very likeable characters who formerly surrounded him and replace them with a bunch of unappealing blowhards.

3. Keep one of the important characters, (Samantha), but make her little more than a paper shuffler and wife of an MP. Make all scenes with her and her husband unspeakably dull and pointless.

4. Forget the lovely theme music that added character and texture to previous episodes and replace it with some weird music that's right out of a B movie.

5. Film as many scenes as you can in grey, light grey, brown, and dark grey.

6. Make the story lines so confusing and convoluted that even Foyle could not solve them without help. Make the stories go on forever with more talk than action in order to bore your audience as much as you can.

7. Make sure almost everyone overacts as much as humanly feasible and see if you can get Michael Kitchen to sleepwalk through everything but the explanation at the end.

I loved Foyle's War and watched every minute of previous seasons. This season does not resemble it in any way.",1387756800,21,1395,4.552

If you didn't watch the first six seasons you will probably enjoy Season 7. As for me, having been spoiled by the stellar quality of the earlier seasons, I am bereft. They didn't even have the good grace to include the implied reason for his traveling to America. That of justice for the man the American magnate ruined and then the American took the poor man's life, thereby finishing the ruin of his wife and son. To find out more on this you'll have to view the episode entitled ""Fifty Ships"", season 2.

I'm not as much of a fan of these latest stories, as they are no longer set in Foyle's quaint home town with all the interesting side stories and people. It is post war and a little bleak, but Foyle remains the clever, calm detective, and it is good to have him paired up again with some of the folks we like to see again. Michael Kitchen manages to convey so much with the merest hint of an expression. This latest series is hard to get on PBS, Amazon streaming works much better.",1384819200,,518,4.19

5321834,5,B009DS6YGO,"I, being a WWII buff, loved the grand depiction of England during the difficult days leading up to and following the war. The series did two things. It combined the historic facts of WWII, the blitz, Nazi sympathizers, spies, sons and husbands dying and/or coming home crippled, with a compelling murder mystery. And, it also presented us with amazingly good characters. Who could not love Sam Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) and Christopher Foyle (Mike Kitchen)? Set Seven is all about the cold war that followed VE Day. Now, Foyle is no longer a detective in Hastings, but is working for MI5 in London, and his prey are generally Soviet spies. But, of course, there's always another murder or two to be solved, and super sleuth Foyle does just that.",1384387200,,747,4.84375

5321837,5,B009DS6YGO,"Having been very disappointed with Season 6; Season 7 is a redemption.  The Series has come back to depths in character and plot that Season 6 seriously lacked in its ""quick telling"" and 'leaps"" to the furtherance of it's childish political undertones.

The political propaganda surrounding Sam and her new life were further enhanced with the replacement of the unwitty character development of her love interest in Season 6 with someone and something more plausible; whether the political messaging was honest or not; it is based on some versions and tellings of history that were welcomed to the the plot in order to support the story and added some depth to the telling. Of course every antagonist is the Big Bad Wolf.

As always the characters of Foyle and Sam are loveable together and the plots take on a special depth, with the addition of new cold war intrique and the new environments in which they are allowed to take the characters.  Twisted a bit; perhaps; over simplified to produce drama; of course; an accurate telling?  Well, more the fairy tale politics and not the pragmatic history of political significance...  Its a mystery and they are well written in Season 7; making these episodes very fun to watch.  They are very good.",1384300800,,1245,4.84433962264151

If not, then start there not here with set seven!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-The-Home-Front-Files-Sets-1-6/dp/B00ANGICCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: The Home Front Files Sets 1-6</a>&nbsp;Of course, this review is influenced by how I feel about sets 1-6!  So, I won't go into who Foyle is or where and when this drama takes place. :-)  After seeing sets 1-6, I'm betting you'll want to see set seven!

I love Michael Kitchen as Christopher Foyle.  Plain and simply, Foyle is my favorite character of this genre.  So, I was anxious to receive the latest offering of Foyle.  Kitchen is still marvelous as Foyle.  In this installment, Foyle remains brilliantly astute, keeping his head while others are losing theirs, shrewd, logical, loyal (to his ""driver"" Sam and to his country) and overall the man of morality/character that drew me to him. (He also continues to have a great BS detector which I must say is much needed in his new position! Indeed!)

How I came to rate this feature with four stars is by averaging between the five stars I give Michael Kitchen for his remarkable portrayal of Foyle given the script he had to work with and three stars for the story line. Bottom line, I will purchase Set Eight if there is one.

I just didn't like the format of finding Foyle in MI-5.  He was practically shanghaied getting off of the ship from America by little more than emotional blackmail to assist MI-5 because Sam (played by Honeysuckle Weeks, his driver from previous episodes) was implicated as a spy.  In order to prove Sam innocent, Foyle felt he could not say no even though he clearly wanted to refuse.  I liked his loyalty and belief in his former colleague by coming to her rescue (so to speak). That is pretty much the plot of episode one in this series.  Of course Sam wasn't a spy (no spoiler there, that's a given) and after proving she wasn't, why Foyle then agreed to continue at MI-5 baffled me.  I really thought that he should have told them, NO! and then gone fishing and waited until he received a better offer from another avenue that appreciated his keen mind. :-) I also didn't get why MI-5 wanted him so badly when throughout the entire three episodes he was undermined, underused, and pretty much mistreated. It seemed as if he wasn't needed, wanted or valued in any way. I just didn't like Foyle being relegated to a position of little standing; I preferred him as Chief Superintendent. The political intrigue was too excessive and disturbing for me. This new set is a type of drama, heavily political, that I don't care for. I like crime solving as the main component with respect shown toward those characters who deserve it.  I would have liked to have seen Foyle return in a role of Superintendent solving crimes.  In the previous six sets there were always instances where Foyle was underestimated but by the end of the episode he came out on top. If you've seen the previous episodes I hope you understand what I mean. Even though the war had ended, war-torn England and all the country was suffering could still have been portrayed with occasional instances of political intrigue (which was effectively shown in the previous six sets of this series.)

Also, while I am glad that Honeysuckle Weeks returned I was not bowled over by her story line and the sub-plots she and her husband brought to the overall tale. I haven't decided if she married well.  I'll have to go back and watch the previous episodes, from set six, and see if that helps me decide.

All in all, I love Christopher Foyle.  He's a man I would want for a friend...definitely for me and not against me.",1382486400,5,3749,4.7993779160186625

5321894,5,B009DS6YGO,"This is a wonderful series from England.  Inspector Foyle is a Police Inspector in a town near the coast of England.  The series Sets 1-6 take place during World War II.  The stories deal with mysteries, murders, and spies.  Germany had numerous spies throughout England during this time and they caused a lot of havoc.  Set 7 takes place just after World War II ends.  He has retired from his role of Police Inspector, but is offered a job in MI5.  This intelligence agency is similar to the CIA in this country.  Some of the characters have played a role throughout the majority of the sets.  The characters are interesting, appealing, but in some cases evil.  This series gives a snapshot of a country who struggled to maintain some kind of life with food shortages, frequent bombing raids, destruction of homes, and the loss of family members. It certainly gives an understanding of the terms ""stiff upper lip"".  Each set is a stand alone set, but it is best to start with the beginning set.

They are set sometime after WWII ends and Foyle is recruited by MI-5 but he (as he never did) does not follow procedure or necessarily the wishes of those running MI-5.

Where are the people you would care about what happened to them.  I can't care about any of these genuinely ugly people nor do I think all the violence is entertainment.

The plots however are much more somber and the history much less engaging. Also in every episode, while the Russians are the problem, the real evil always lies in the government organization Foyle now works for. One longs for a straight forwared spy story without knowing that his own people are the problem. Also Samantha was a real delight in the earlier series as Foyle's niave but dedicated driver.

When does morality take a second seat to the good of the country?

These have been consistently good stories, rich in complex, multifaceted and interwoven plots.  The conclusions not always as expected always make sense.  If you start at the beginning you will start to understand Foyle's thinking, look for clues as they are presented and become a participating detective all the way through.

The plot lines are amazing in this series and the tension each story produces is palpable.  Even though World War II is over, you learn almost immediately that there's a new war on - the Cold War.  The episodes are darker; the acting a bit angrier, as if disillusionment has seeped into every business, every home, every character.  If you lived through the Cold War, as I have, you will recognize the powerful thread of truth about the free world and the insidious threat posed by a fast growing Communist Russia.  Different but every bit as good as the first 6 seasons, I offer just one bit of advice.

5321934,3,B009DS6YGO,"I purchased the newest season without a second thought as soon as I noticed it was available, while the price is a bit steep for a three show season I've enjoyed the previous shows so much that I couldn't do anything but pick it up.

Within moments of the start of the first episode you can tell this is not the same show that debuted in 2002, it is much more somber, darker, than the previous episodes have been, and considering they were set in the middle of WWII that is more than odd.  There is a lack of life, or spark if you will in Mr Foyle, and Sam seems downright ill.  Her depiction was so unlike the previous seasons that I was waiting for her to be diagnosed with a long lingering illness to justify the difference in her character, though don't take that as a plot spoiler please.

The episodes are beautifully filmed, settings evocative of just what the creators were shooting for with the period piece. However, the stories themselves were very simplistic.  I was never on edge over who the bad guys were, there was no building of suspense, no tension other than regretting the loss of the quality and life that the series is now sadly missing. The plot of the third episode was so telegraphed and clich&eacute; that it wasn't a matter of what was going to happen, but when.

I will continue to keep up with the series if there are any more seasons produced, but I can't see it lasting much longer at this rate.",1380672000,3,1426,4.382575757575758
5321935,5,B009DS6YGO,"After the last couple of season's of ""Foyle's War"", I didn't have high expectations for a new post-War series. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that Series 7 (Series 8 in the UK) has much better writing than Series 5 and 6, during which characters seemed to devolve into superficial collections of mannerisms, behavior was sometimes far-fetched, and plots often weak. ""Foyle's War"" is now the Cold War, and the series has moved from the south coast of England to London. Great Britain still needs Christopher Foyle's talents of detection, now in the interest of Cold War counterespionage. Miss Pierce (Ellie Haddington), formerly of the Special Operations Executive, is now highly placed in MI5, where she's joined by Arthur Valentine (Tim McMullen), an underling who doesn't quite trust Foyle. Samantha Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), now Wainwright, has moved to London with her husband Adam (Daniel Weyman), who is pursuing a career in politics.

Sam's domestic situation highlights some of the social issues prominent in Great Britain after the War: food shortages, high crime, unemployment. But there is a sense of optimism for the future, which Adam Wainwright deeply believes, as he campaigns for a national health service. The series is critical of Cold War intelligence agencies, though this may be intended to reflect dissatisfaction with the current and recent behavior of those agencies rather than as historical commentary. Secrets are a common theme, as spy agencies seem to spend as much time keeping secrets from each other and from other agencies as they do collecting intelligence. Foyle tends to expend a lot of energy trying to figure out what is going on within his own department. MI5's methods, including torture, and the many moles in British government agencies are also at issue.

The first two episodes of Series 7, ""The Eternity Ring"" and ""Cage"", are terrific espionage thrillers with complex plots that keep the audience guessing. ""Sunflower"" is not quite as good and focuses more on the politics of alleged Nazi war criminals and moral compromise in the face of a perceived Soviet threat. Before this new series, I thought that Foyle was a character that we didn't need to see any more of, but the writers have risen to the occasion and given us a good Cold War detective series. I hope they can keep it up. ""The Eternity Ring"" and ""Sunflower"" were written by series creator Anthony Horowitz; ""The Cage"" was written by David Kane. The episodes are:

Upon returning from his trip to the United States, Foyle is intercepted by MI5 agents who insist that he accompany them to London in ""The Eternity Ring"". Special Operations Executive has been ""wound down"" since the war and transformed into a new counterintelligence agency. Sir William Chambers (Nicholas Jones), at its head, requests, against the advice of Miss Pierce (Ellie Haddington), that Foyle assist in investigating an alleged ring of spies who are passing nuclear secrets to the Soviets. Foyle is believed to have a connection to the case, in that his former driver Sam Stewart -now Samantha Wainwright, now employed as the secretary of nuclear scientist Michael Fraser (Stephen Boxer), has been photographed passing something to a known Soviet agent. Hoping he can help, Foyle learns that his employers are keeping as many secrets as their enemies.

Foyle is officially on the MI5 payroll in ""The Cage"", and his first case is to find out who is responsible for betraying information about safehouses in which 3 Soviet defectors have been murdered. Sam starts work at the agency and tries her best to do whatever research Foyle requires, while her husband campaigns for the upcoming election in which he hopes to be made a Labour MP. A Russian man (Rad Kaim) has recently stumbled into a hospital bleeding to death and only able to utter one phrase to the doctor on duty: ""ten eye."" Meanwhile, a suspected Soviet agent has successfully fled to East Berlin, and Arthur Valentine will probably be blamed. And Sam's husband is trying to help a woman in his district whose daughter has gone missing. For Foyle, all roads seem to lead to a military base called Barton Hall, whose post-War mission is not entirely clear.

In ""Sunflower"", Sir Alec (Rupert Vansittart), head of MI5, asks Foyle to assess the risk to former Nazi SS officer Karl Strasser (Lars Eidinger), who is living in London under the guise of a Dutch art expert, while he provides MI5 with valuable intelligence on Soviet spy networks. Strasser believes that his life is in danger, because a man is following him, and someone is leaving ominous objects at his home. Meanwhile, Sam's husband Adam has to deal with a constituent who believes that the land he sold to the government before the War has been deliberately over-valued in order to prevent him from buying it back. This episode is less a detective story than a rumination on the moral compromises made in the name of the ""greater good"", as persons of power in Parliament and MI5 break the law to advance agendas based on their own value judgments.",1380585600,,5061,4.956419316843345
5321936,5,B009DS6YGO,"I purchased Series 1-5 of Foyle's War and have thoroughly enjoyed them.  I have watched them many, many times.  I then purchased Series 6 and was very disappointed in it because it was awful.  It was my belief that the creator of Foyle's War had lost his touch and therefore I had no interest in seeing the newest series.  But on an impulse, I bought the newest series.  When I started watching, I thought I had made a huge mistake in buying this.  The music was different, cinematography was different, and the stories seemed different.  But the more I watched it, I realized that the creator had done a wonderful job of incorporating Foyle and Samantha into the Cold War era.  The music and cinematography reflected that change so beautifully and helped me to put the stories into the right context - England starting its recovery from the war.  One reviewer said that they wanted Foyle to go back to Hastings.  But it became clear to me that the writers were showing how things had changed, even in Hastings.  One of the soldiers who arrived in London after the war was from Hastings and he told Foyle that his home at been ""bombed out"" and his family had relocated to London.  This is one clue to the viewer that Hastings was no longer the beautiful seaside city and had also been changed by the war.

Christopher Foyle brought all his skills and talents to an agency that did not operate the same way as his Hasting police force.  It was interesting to watch both Foyle and the MI5 agents adjusting to each other.  Each of the three episodes were like full length movies.  I enjoyed the twists and turns in the plots during all the episodes. I highly recommend this series.  It's the best I have seen in a long, long time.",1380499200,,1727,4.483974358974359
5321937,1,B009DS6YGO,"So far I've seen 2 episodes of what is Season 7 in the U.S. I'm seriously disappointed. The previous seasons had charm as well as realism, and thought and feeling as well as the portrayal of behavior under stress. Now the series seems intent on showing us only the ugliness of the postwar period, and that element seems far overdone. I've seen more than enough spy and gangster stories in my lifetime and more than enough graphic violence. Why couldn't the creators at least have seen the series through to the end of the war, the beginning of rebuilding as troops began arriving home and the wonder and confusion of people as they began to anticipate and look forward to peace and change. It would have been edifying just watching them, magnificent and not so wonderful both, as they recognized that the end of the war was coming and began to think of rebuilding while still going on with the fighting but yet facing the already overwhelming aftermath of coping with lives lost, damaged people and society and infrastructure, and recognizing the changes that must be dealt with -- all the things that must be put right after such a war -- without going into all the American-style gangsterism this new postwar series seems bent upon focusing.  The show seems to have gone American (says this American) in terms of its too vivid violence and hectic action, and it has left England and her charms, unique grit, reality, and the portrayal of her strengths and sheer doggedness and courage of her people behind. I may hang in another episode or so, but so far this new series seems like Americanized violence with a British accent. How very sad and what a great loss.",1380412800,10,1664,4.679180887372014
5321938,5,B009DS6YGO,"It is important to note that this is no longer the charming police mystery series set in a picturesque English village on a lovely coastline, filled with camaraderie between diverse characters.  Rather it is now become an espionage drama.  That said, it is still top-notch.  We loved it and will continue to order new sets if and when they become available.  The tone is much darker.  While WWII was obviously a terrible time for the Brits (and the rest of the world), there was more of a sense of getting through it together, which seemed to make everyone stronger.  This is a new, secret war, being fought outside of common knowledge.  It wasn't a shared effort, in fact, there was quite a bit of doubt about who was an enemy and who was not.  Suspicion is an attitude that darkens our hearts and lives.  Still, the adventure continues as good fights evil and we look for little triumphs along the way to the end of the war, which will not happen in Foyle's lifetime or perhaps, mine.  I still recommend this to anyone interested in good history-oriented entertainment.",1380412800,,1071,4.648936170212766

5321940,5,B009DS6YGO,"While only offering three new episodes, Jill Green and Anthony Horowitz have crafted a smooth transition for former Chief Inspector Foyle and Samantha Wainwright (nee Stewart) into post war England.  There will no doubt be some who were anticipating an American chapter where Foyle hunts down Howard Paige from ""50 Ships"" but the first episode, ""The Eternity Ring"", begins with Foyle's return from America.  He's immediately approached by MI5 to join the murky world of spy rings and double agents.  Reluctant, he tries to resist but Sam is implicated in the story's plot and Foyle must intervene in order to save her from prosecution.  As a result Sam winds up working for the organization as Foyle's assistant.  With DI Milner presumably at the police constabulary in Brighton, Sam's husband, Adam becomes a secondary lead as he wins his seat in Parliament and figures prominently in the third episode, ""Sunflower"".

These have a  darker, more sinister feel than the war time episodes and some might miss the Hastings seascapes, but I found the transition to be very well done and offering the potential for more dramatic diversity as the series plays out.  While much of the WW2 story lines included depictions of the sacrifices and hardships Britain suffered, it also showed a public largely pulling together for the patriotic cause.  By comparison the post war ushers in a more byzantine era where trust and patriotism can no longer be taken for granted.  The final episode ends with an uncharacteristically somber Foyle questioning the future.  And though Sam is pleasantly surprised to discover she's pregnant, it's still an uncertain future for her as husband Adam finds that doing the right thing as a Member of Parliament doesn't always work out for the best.  There were few glorious moments in the Cold War and no battlefield victories by which to gauge who was winning.  Horowitz has crafted near perfect dramas that convey the uncertainty the late 1940's brought to a nation already exhausted by years of war.  The development of the Adam Wainwright character brings the element of social justice and politics into the mix and illustrates just how difficult it can be to recover from a major war even when you win.

As usual there's ancillary information in the bonus feature conveying how the stories follow, or differ, from the actual events they're based on.  Additionally, Tony Horowitz has a video prelude to each episode in which he sets up the circumstances and background while noting areas of dramatic license and why it was taken.  The episodes were largely shot in Dublin, a stand in for post war London, as the smaller city offered a more authentic backdrop with period Georgian architecture and narrow streets.  Cost over-runs stemming from a quest for authenticity were largely responsible for ITV's original cancelation and rushed completion of series 4 & 5.  It's hopeful the Dublin location will reduce production costs to a more manageable level, possibly allowing for a four episode Series 8.  As has been the case since the end of Series 5 there's always some doubt as to whether additional episodes will be forthcoming.  The final scene in ""Sunflower"" was ambiguous at best, but both Green and Horowitz sounded positive about their desire to move forward.  Additionally, Acorn has indicated in press releases ""there are more episodes scheduled for next year"" and they ""hope for many more seasons"". It should be noted however that Michael Kitchen is now 65, an age when Brit TV detectives start heading for their vegetable gardens and Cornish cottages. He once famously said that he refused to end his career as a doddering TV detective pondering retirement, so savor the episodes we have, but pray for more.",1380326400,,3742,5.011308562197092

In my opinion, the producers unwisely discounted the value of the Hastings locale and time period in the success of the series. Too bad, because my friends and I think Foyle's War prior seasons represent all the very best of British television.  Nevertheless, Season 7 appears to me to be clutching at straws.

5321944,2,B009DS6YGO,"I know I'm going against the highly favorable reviews the latest instalment of Foyle's War is getting here, but I can't really join along with the enthusiastic praise.  Don't get me wrong.  The series is still eminently watchable thanks to Michael Kitchen and the endearing Honeysuckle Weeks and the scenes and settings are well done and give a good idea of the drab and cheerless place post-WWII ""austerity Britain"" was.

<spoilers>

It's just that switching Foyle from being a policeman to being an MI5 security agent seems to have resulted in plot events that don't strike me as terribly realistic.  In two of the episodes, Foyle deals with cases where the Soviet intelligence service murders British nationals and Soviet defectors.  Granted, Russian ""diplomats"" acted very thuggishly at times, but I don't believe for a moment that in that time frame, they would have dared to act that way on British soil.

Another thing that bothered me was an episode where Foyle commissioned a former Special Operations Executive operative to break into a covert British military intelligence base and rescue a British citizen who was mistakenly abducted after being confused with another woman by the same name.  I really, REALLY doubt that something like that could have happened.

I was also disappointed by the way that the dangling plot thread from the great Foyle's War episode ""50 Ships"" was resolved.  When we last saw Foyle before this season, he was embarking on a ship to America to catch up with a murderer who had escaped justice due to pressing national security interests.  I thought this would have made an ideal episode for the series...""Foyle in America.""  But instead, that plot thread is resolved by saying that the murderer killed himself apparently in response to a threat of arrest or exposure instigated by Foyle.

<spoilers end>

I can't help but contrast improbable plot developments like those cited above with the stories that took place in World War II. I felt that those had a ring of authenticity to them and what made them interesting was the fact that WWII in the Home Islands created some pretty unique and fascinating criminal cases for Foyle to solve that wouldn't have happened at any other time.

So to sum up, I'm not sorry I bought the DVD of this collection, but I'm going to watch the next set of episodes if there are any before buying that DVD set.

***

Coda after watching the third episode of the season:

<spoilers>

I found myself lowering my initial three star rating of this set to two stars after watching ""Sunflower.""  It was good up until the very end.  The premise was okay and based on some historical fact...that allies made use of German intelligence operatives who had blood on their hands in the aftermath of WWII.  Where it ran off the rails was the resolution.  Foyle had figured out that MI5 had faked the death of one such German it was making use of.  Foyle had confronted the German at an airfield but seemed resigned to the fact that the man was going to slip through his fingers.

Then in a truly implausible deus ex machina, a couple of American military officers come up and apprehend the German to face trial for ordering the shooting of American prisoners in 1944 in France.  Foyle did not tip the Americans off but another disaffected MI5 operative did.  The Americans take the German into custody and the credits roll.

C'mon.  Britain was a sovereign nation back in the aftermath of WWII.  The idea that two American military officers could detain someone who was under the protection of the British Government gives new meaning to the term absurd.

And it's worth pointing out that the United States did not exactly have an immaculate record in terms of Germans it used for intelligence activities.  One such individual was Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyon.""  We made use of this Nazi thug despite the French demanding that we hand him over to them and helped him flee to South America.

The truth is that boatloads of Germans and their collaborators escaped consequences for hideous crimes they committed during WWII.  Most of them did so without assistance of Western intelligence services.  But the ones who were lucky enough to have ""friends"" were particularly likely to evade justice...which Barbie did until decades later.",1380067200,21,4297,4.854395604395604

5321946,4,B009DS6YGO,"I am such a fan of Christopher Foyle. I saw all of the previous episodes, and now we have three new ones.

The Second World War is over and the Cold War is upon us. The time of spies, and sleuths. Foyle has returned from the US, and due to some interesting circumstances he is asked to work for MI5. As fate would have it, he happens upon his driver from the War, Sam Weeks. She is in a boring job and the chance to work with Foyle again is superb. She is also married, and her husband, Adam, is running for the Labour MP.  Adam is an idealistic you g man wanting to do Goid work for his constituents and his country. Interestingly enough, the issues facing Adam are also part of the cases Foyle is facing.

Foyle is also idealistic and in the second episode he is asked to investigate the death of a Russian informant. Thus investigation takes him to some interesting areas, one is a secret house that is using some untoward acts to interrogate prisoners. At the same time, Adam's campaign manager wants to use some nefarious means to publicize the negatives of his opponent. Adam does not want anything to do with kind of campaigning, but can he shop it and still be elected.

As always, Sam is the colleague who knows, sees and does a great deal to help Foyle. Her job as driver is a ruse of sorts. She should really share billing. She is not so subtle at times, just like Foyle. Foyle also likes to accomplish good works, and he does this as often as he can. He is sometimes not looked at as someone with authority, but he has no problem earning that title very quickly. The MI5 team recognizes this and recognize how important he is to their organization.

PBS's Masterpiece Theatre has shown two of the episodes, with the third episode to be shown this week. This is a series without too much violence, more intellectual and footwork are part of the practice. I look forwRd to many more episodes.

It is 1946, and George Orwell's prediction of ""a cold war"" is coming to pass, with former allies engaging in a race for power and information that may lead to ultimate destruction.
In ""The Eternity Ring"" Foyle, upon returning from America is picked up literally dockside by MI5 agents and coerced into investigating an alleged Russian spy ring.  ""The Cage"" is about a secret military facility that comes to light as Foyle investigates the deaths of several Russian defectors.  ""The Sunflower"" brings together the old war and the new as Foyle looks into the assassination attempts on a former Nazi, a defector who is now under the protection of MI5.
  Each of these riveting episodes is based on an historical event or person, be sure to watch Anthony Horowitz's introduction before viewing the episode.  This adds even more richness of detail to a series that has flawlessly portrayed the war years, and is now giving viewers an excellent rendition of life in Britain during the post war time period.  Not only do we have the accurate and gripping mysteries, but also slice of life story elements that highlight how much the world has changed in the aftermath of the great conflict.
If you are a fan of Foyle's War, you will definitely want to own this DVD.  The stories are exciting and accurate, the bonus features include 86 minutes (four featurettes) of special material as well as the above mentioned introductions.  And while DCS Foyle is superb, we get to see ""Sam"" Samantha Wainwright (Honeysuckle Weeks) newly married and helping her politician husband with his career.

5321951,5,B009DS6YGO,"It will be interesting to see how fans of FOYLE'S WAR take to its new setting and time period: cosmopolitan London in 1945 after the war is over and when what George Orwell terms the ""Cold War"" is commencing. In the first episode, Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle is drafted by MI5 to help investigate a spy case involving the Soviets and a possible Eternity spy circle.  This new series opens with a bang - literally - as the A-Bomb is detonated in New Mexico.  The Soviets want the A-Bomb and Foyle's smarts are enlisted to help prevent a spy ring from obtaining information or materials regarding it.

Foyle's former driver, Samantha, is encountered by Foyle and she helps in the investigation. Her husband is running for a Parliament seat.  It appears that MI5 will make good use of Foyle this season and Samantha will go along for the ride.  Speaking of ride, love the autos, fashion, and architecture of this time period.  I prefer the Cold War actually as a setting for a mystery so am delighted with the new direction and possibilities of this series this season - it will be interesting to see what other reviewers think.

In the second episode, a young woman is missing, a dead body turns up and a scientist is murdered in his home.  Are these incidents connected?  Foyle seems to be about the only competent one at MI5.  Sam gets a job working there as a typist, simultaneously helping her husband run for Parliament.

5321953,5,B009DS6YGO,"SET 7 ---Cold War Foyle's War keeps fans mesmerized in entertainment. 3 NEW EPISODES set in 1946-47. As excellent as the British home-front WWII series. Perfection in period dramatizing history, with action, romance, mystery, and suspense. Communism and traitors are new issues. Storylines are based on real people/events, confirms Anthony Horowitz (creator & writer of 2 episodes).

Foyle's War is a modern classic, indisputably the FINEST war and now post-war drama and crime mystery combo ever produced. Foyle reigns.

Michael Kitchen continues playing Foyle, driving himself. Kitchen is a master at facial expression and line delivery timing. He says much without voice. What joy! 'Sam' (Honeysuckle Weeks) returns in all 3, now married, but these 2 reconnect in odd ways. The tradition of perfection in detail continues in sets, locals (filmed in period-rich Ireland), costumes, and props. Each episode retains the fact that there are subplots, thus multiple stories all at once, intricately woven in precision. Hastings local crime has changed to London and MI5 (Brit homeland security started even before WWI or II).

SUBTITLES for three 90+ min episodes plus the entire bonus (longer than an episode).
THE ETERNITY RING--1945-46
Foyle returns from America only to be drawn under MI5 threat into a Russian spy adventure. Sam's married Adam Wainwright (Daniel Weyman, all 3 eps) a politician, they involved in plot and subplot. She works with a nuclear scientist and lives in a post-war prefab. Eternity ring is code for a Soviet spy ring. Nicholas Jones is Sir Wm chambers; Ellie Haddington returns as Hilda Pierce (in all 3 eps) a top MI5 position; and Glenvil Harris is Jeremy Swift in all 3 eps.

THE CAGE--June, 1946
Another true story inspired this spy segment where Lt Col Galt (Jonothan Hide) is held in the cage. Rationing and food shortage remains causing many to ask ""What was the war for?"" NKDV adds mystery when again Foyle deals with murder. Tim McMullen (played in all 3 eps) is agent Valentine, in charge of safehouses gone wrong. MI5 gets a new head, Rupert Vansittart fills the role in this and the next episode.

SUNFLOWER--1947 with 1944 war back story
Will a stalked ex-Nazi (Lars Eidinger) be assassinated before Foyle can help him? MP Wainwright has his own story in politics and helping constituents. Teacher Thomas's (Charles Aitken) story is about his return from the front with shock, now PTSD. 1944 ""Sunflower"" operation was a real Nazi war crime event now dramatized.

If you watched ""Foyle's War: Series 1-5 -From Dunkirk to VE-Day"", then Set 6, you'll want these 3 feature-length episodes too. 6-STAR ENTERTAINMENT. Foyle's War is one of the best programs I've seen on TV.
As always, the question is, will Foyle's War return? Rumor says Series 8. Others say Kitchen is done, but he said that before. Horowitz says there is historic material enough for many more.

5321956,5,B009DS6YGO,"There is a set of series 1-7 on an all region Blu-ray box out in Australia. The technical quality of these discs is excellent with clear sound and very nice picture quality. The subtitles are for the hearing impaired and hop about a bit with different colours but are otherwise very good. There are no extras on the discs but a very nice booklet is enclosed with details on each case.
The series itself is a little slow by todays standards but it never drags and the cases are full of clever and well thought out twists. There is none of the gratuitous sex and excessive violence that almost all TV dramas heap on us these days and this series is so much the better for that. The set is a mixture of 10801 and 1080p that might be a problem with older TVs and players in the US but otherwise all discs are ABC. The box is oversize and my set arrived cracked requiring a repack into two 6 disc blank Blu-ray boxes (and scans of the insert) and it is actually the better for the repack as it now fits perfectly with my other Blu-ray discs. This is an outstanding set and at some $7 per 3 hour disc it is a bargain! Go for it as a prelude to this new series 8",1374105600,,1155,4.115044247787611

5321958,4,B009DS6YGO,"Outcry and popular demand brought about additional installments of the wildly popular crime drama Foyle's War chronicling the cases of a keen British detective protecting the home front while a world is at war. Penned by Anthony Horowitz, the most recent installments may honor the end of one war but begins the start of a new, equally threatening one.

England is not the same place it once was. The horrors of a second world war are still raw in the minds of the people and upon his return to his homeland Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is reminded of the stark remnants. Just back from America, two things consecutively happen soon as he sets foot on British soil. He meets again with a former policeman he once worked with in Hastings just released from spending years as a POW and his services are requisitioned by MI5 leading him again into the acquaintance of the formidable Miss Pierce (Ellie Haddington). Disinterested in working for the government spooks, Foyle is compelled to help them uncover a Russian spy ring known as ""The Eternity Circle"" until he learns they are looking at Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks) as a suspect when presented with photographic evidence. Not believing that his former driver could in any way be involved, Foyle agrees to help MI5 in order to make sure no harm comes to Sam and her politically minded husband, Adam (Daniel Weyman).

Pushing forward in his investigation, Foyle learns that working among his colleagues involves learning the ins and out of politics - and that protecting the wrong people is MI5's business. He soon discovers there are more shady dealings going on inside the walls of the MI5 offices rather than out, and it becomes a question of figuring out who is trustworthy and who is not.

Nothing ever stays the same. This is something we know, but golly, it's hard when we have to wave good-bye to such a beautiful piece of nostalgia. And if we were honest, this series is just that. Not in the traditional sense, this series experienced a gripping identity to its stories and more poignant moments than any unsuspecting viewer would ever expect, we are now given a duller, less shiny version of that. Where it once managed to be quaint and terribly brilliant, it feels as if there's a weight on the shoulders of everyone. Seeing this come to a close was the end of an era and seeing it return (in 2011) was a joyous occasion, one that seemed unable be matched and upped. Now, a new year brought us three all new installments and people, oh my stars are you in for unexpected and sometimes, sad changes.

Instead of moving viewers with the things that easily humanized the stories - like the needless, tragic deaths of those on the home front - missing in these new installments is the same focus on people, now the angles zero in on political schemes and governments protecting former war enemies. It's a new mine field for everyone to navigate, leaving us and oftentimes Foyle more exasperated than satisfied justice is being served. The first few minutes of `Eternity Circle' starts out well presenting a group of people who possess a very dangerous, terrifying knowledge before it kind of fizzles out. The character's seemed only half-hearted, the mystery written poorly and not at all as intelligent as some of the prior chapters. Part of me understands the emotions of this series - a long and hard fought war is still fresh in the mind of these people, and another part misses all the spunk, humor and cleverness of what this series built itself on. Fortunately, the final episode is the best of the group (more on this later) and also has a wonderful conclusion to what seemed an untouchable situation.

Those who are unfamiliar with this series may suffer in places from a lack of knowledge as the show references an American entrepreneur who once escaped Foyle's reach or the history there is between Samantha Stewart (now Wainwright) and Foyle, and has undergone some (glaringly) obvious shortcomings and changes from what was once a more ""solid,"" character relationship. Sam is no longer the same plucky girl we laughed with and ended up loving; now she seems weary and less up for a bit of sleuthing whereas before she was eager and willing to do nearly anything. There is one scene involving her husband's political run that was typical Sam and for a moment, we were again reminded of who the old Sam was and it was a ray of sunshine. She and Adam are cute together (in rare moments of spontaneity) but if memory serves correct, I preferred the actor who portrayed this character in the last series better.

Where the first two installments aren't the best of the bunch (humbly, this is just my opinion and as with any form of entertainment, fans may disagree with that), 'Sunflower' is brilliant! Saving it for last was a great strategy as it whets our anticipation, wanting more and it's all the harder to say good-bye when the screen goes black. (Plus Foyle gets an epically good moment at the end!) It is dark as it covers a frightening period of the war and counteracts these tendencies by offering the human side of the story through Foyle's eyes and his determination to always look for truth and justice in those investigations. Avid fans will pick up on the little changes. They add up and offer new perspectives, sometimes for the better, oftentimes they leave the show worse for the wear as if the war took its toll behind the lens of this history piece of cinematic entertainment - there is a dullness where once this was a bright copper penny; the creativity seems ""zapped."" That being said, don't let my cynical ramblings ruin anything, any fan of this ITV series (myself included!) will enjoy set seven - it's really the bees knees; Horowitz puts out another solid edition of mystery, mayhem and of course, the keen investigative eye of Christopher Foyle is on the case. That's worth any flaws.

These latest episodes have, as the review title indicates, seriously raised the bar, and my attention was caught from the start.  The older episodes were great in their own right, but these have eclipsed them, and I cannot wait to see what happens next.

'Sunflower', in particular, was my favorite here - deliciously horrifying.",1372291200,7,595,4.5327102803738315

Character development is well scripted and acted making the viewer waiting for the next installment of a period piece of history that has shaped much of the modern day world. Anthony Horowitz has done a superb job of reconstructing history and Michael Kitchen has done an equally superb job of portraying it out on screen, topcoat and fedora etc.

5321961,4,B009DS6YGO,"The UK DVD's have the proper series numbers. Series 7 just came out last week in the UK, and I got mine and watched it already

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Foyles-War-Series-7-DVD/dp/B00BCRZCA8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1369259595&sr=8-1&keywords=foyles+war+7

To correct some of the bad misinformation that's going on here, both the UK ""series 7"" and the US ""set 7"" are the same. I buy the UK versions (a region-free DVD player is needed) because they come out months sooner than the US versions. And many times, the US versions are edited. If the series was shown here on PBS, and there is a PBS logo on the front of the DVD (ie, Downton Abbey DVD's) they are edited usually. FYI, the episode titles for series 7 AND set 7 are: The Eternity Ring, The Cage, and Sunflower. Only 3 episodes. And longtime fans of the series will probably miss the Paul Milner character, played by Anthony Howell - he's not in this series. Honeysuckle Weeks returns as Sam, but no Milner.

It was nice to see Foyle again, but it's strange that he's taking orders from others, as he's working for the government instead of the police. The ""old"" Foyle that I know and love would have told them to bugger off instead of letting them recruit him so easily - literally after he just gets off the ship, returning from his trip to America. Buy Foyle does get to quietly correct and politely admonish his superiors, something he's very good at. He has a quiet strength about him. If you've seen Michael Kitchen in other roles, this role is not really a stretch for him, he really does speak and act that way.

This series deals more with the post war ""cold war"" that was also going on in England. It's a tad darker than the first 6 series I think. Even Sam has lost some of her youthful good nature, maybe that's down to struggling through the war and it's aftermath, I don't know, but she's not as cheerful this time out.

This series may not 100% up to par with the middle series of Foyle's War, but it's still a great show. The acting is great, and if you watch a lot of British TV shows, you'll know many of the actors by sight.

So again, in England, there are and have only been 7 SERIES of this show, no matter what US TV or Acorn US has done with the numbers. They are not ""seasons"" in the UK, they are series. Partly because they're very short series, and they can come and go at any time, not in the autumn like here in America (I lived in London for two years).

1 (23) ""The Eternity Ring"" (Episode 1 in the series, Episode 23 in total.)
2 (24) ""The Cage""
3 (25) ""Sunflower""

The story line continues to impress and the actors are wonderful - I would love to know that Michael Kitchen knows he has a die-hard fan in the U.S.!!!  And Honeysuckle Weeks is charming.  Anthony Horowitz does his homework and the historic value of this series is amazing - besides being gripping, it is nice to know that there is a real life connection.  I love this series and recommend it to everyone I know!",1524009600,,466,4.578313253012048
