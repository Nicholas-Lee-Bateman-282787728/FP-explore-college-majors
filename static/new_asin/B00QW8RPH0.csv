8693167,2,B00QW8RPH0,"This is an awesome blu-ray, great music, wonderful performance, BUT with a fatal flaw!  I bought Symphony No. 6 in this series and loved it!
Loved it so much I ordered Nos. 5, 7, 8, and 9 to get all the Mature Bruckner Symphonies.  No. 5 is great like No. 6.  BUT Nos. 7,8 and 9 have a miserable video fault that is intermittent.  It looks like the picture goes all herringbone, checked, overlaying the whole screen sometimes or just the background behind conductor Barenboim.  Sometimes it is there, then a great picture quality for a while (a min. or 3) then it will come back for a few seconds or a min.  I thought for a while it might be my equipment, but it is repeatable every time, the video messes up at the same places every time and often.
The audio quality is AWESOME and just makes you love having these performances.  AND the picture quality is OFTEN so great you can see everything, Mr. Barenboim, comb your hair!!!  Sorry, joking, he is a MASTER!!!!!  Conducts each and every symphony from start to finish by memory!!!!!  No sheet music for this genius conductor.
These blu-rays are ruined for me, so I tried to return them, but I am an overseas customer, half-way around the world, and Amazon's return policy from overseas REALLY SUCKS now, so I am stuck with them.  AND I figure even a replacement disc will be defective too.  Only you will know, I will not find out.
I hope this helps somebody out there.
One more point about Sym. No. 9, this is the original score, there is NO 4th movement as Bruckner never got it completed.  I would like to have a version that others have finished on his behalf, just for the sake of getting closure at the end of this emotional symphony.  YMMV.

8693169,5,B00QW8RPH0,"Great Barenboim Bruckner again.  He has reccorded this work at least 3-4 times, and I'm not sure that his first CSO recording isn't his best, but still, he knows the 9th, particularly the finale, and this is a pleasurable video endeavor.  It probably is identical to any future CDs of the Bruckner Cycle with the Staatskapelle Berlin (the 7th is already out on DG).",1429833600,,365,4.6875
