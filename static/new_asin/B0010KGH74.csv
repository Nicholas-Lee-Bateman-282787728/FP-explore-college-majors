8238012,4,B0010KGH74,"Triumph of Hercules has always been one of my favorite films from the sword and sandal genre. It stars Dan Vadis as the demi-god Hercules and he plays the character in a much different manner than Steve Reeves or Reg Park. Vadis brings a bit of humour to the role. Though not a bully you can see he enjoys being the son of a""god"".He uses his great strength only in the cause of justice and he has a great deal of fun doing it. In a scene that will be familiar to readers of Marvel Comics'the Mighty Thor,Hercules has his godly power removed by Jove ,his father. Luckily it's returned in the movie's climax just in time for him to vanquish the bad guys. The other featured film on this disc is Medusa vs. The Son of Hercules a.k.a Perseus the Invincible. It stars Richard Harrison as the Greek hero Perseus. Not as muscular as some of the other ""actors"" who appear in these type of films Harrison is reasonbly athletic and makes for a good hero. When I first saw this film as a kid I was disappointed that the Medusa in this film wasn't portrayed as a beautiful woman with snakes for hair as I had read about in mythology. Instead it was portrayed as being some sort of tree/snake hybrid. It still however possesed the power to turn whoever looked at it into stone. This is still a good little adventure film and I recommend it to fans of the genre.",1243296000,,1348,4.311023622047244
