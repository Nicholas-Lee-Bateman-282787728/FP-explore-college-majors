2306518,5,B0009NZ6N4,I was pleased to see this DVD on amazon's website.  I am a high school English teacher and this DVD supplements my Tuesdays with Morrie unit perfectly.  We just watched it as a class the other day and the students loved being able to connect with Morrie as a real human being not just a character in the book.  Morrie's warmth transcends through the screen and he really is the person everyone wants to be friends with.  The interviews show Morrie's deteriorating condition and just what this disease does.  Also the extras are excelllent with great features like an interview between Ted and Mitch Albom.,1178668800,7,605,4.723809523809524
2306519,5,B0009NZ6N4,"This documentary pairs well with the novel, ""Tuesdays with Morrie"".  Morrie Schwartz seems to be such a lovable, intelligent, insightful, brave man.  I was truly touched.",1169337600,5,170,5.5
2306520,5,B0009NZ6N4,"My husband and I enjoyed this DVD so much as we dealt with his own terminal illness. It helped us talk about tough things and gave us hope that the last part of his life needn't be spent in fear or desperation.  Absolutely tender, honest and very inspiring.",1167350400,13,257,4.354166666666667
2306521,5,B0009NZ6N4,"A great companion to book, ""Tuesdays with Morrie."" Ted Koppel does a sensitive and no nonsense interview of Morrie Schwartz. DVD was in new condition as advertised. I purchased it as a gift.",1163030400,5,190,4.787878787878788
2306522,5,B0009NZ6N4,"In these interviews Morrie Schwartz shares with his audience what it means to live with meaning.  All too often all of us get caught up in the day to day grind and do not take time to be aware of the things that are important until it is too late as they say.  We can learn from Morrie what we can do to live now, each and every day with purpose, kindness, and certitude that we have a purpose.  Morrie Schwartz left his mark via these interviews. In addition, I believe Ted Koppel did some of his most important journalist work when interviewing Morrie Schwartz.

I have used this material with college students, and they have walked away from class different people as a result of their encounter with the now posthumous Morrie Schwartz. He has truly been given the gift of eternal life!",1163030400,16,789,4.458333333333333
2306523,5,B0009NZ6N4,"For everyone who loved 'Tuesdays with Morrie', this is a must-have addition to the library. It gives even further insight into the extraordinary story and life lessons taught by Morrie Schwartz and in a gloomy and hazy world, provides a true example of spirit and courage.",1151712000,15,272,4.934782608695652
8063986,5,B0009NZ6N4,"This is three Nightline episodes Ted Koppel did interviewing Morrie Schwartz with addition commentary and bonus material. WHO?!?! you ask. Morrie of ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" that is who. And if you still ask WHO?!?! Then 1) order this DVD and 2) either order the book ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" by Mitch Albom from Amazon (new or used) or, better yet, go to your library and check it out and read it while waiting for the DVD to arrive. It is a quick read but it will hit you in the gut. Then when the DVD comes in watch it. You will want to rewatch it with captions on to write down several of Morrie's views on death, life at the end and how you should treat your fellow human beings. Morrie had ALS and died three weeks after the third Nightline program aired. This DVD is worth the money to accompany ""Tuesdays with Morrie.""  With some of the things Morrie shares about death and the end of life, I believe you can actually help people who are dying and in despair or fighting it every inch of the way even though death is inevitable.  Sorry Amazon, I am not selling this back to you. I intend to share it with friends instead (along with the book which I will be buying from you).",1393718400,,1179,4.306306306306307
8063987,5,B0009NZ6N4,The Lessons on Living DVD is of great quality.  The picture and sound are clear.  The product met my expectations.,1334966400,,114,4.65
8063988,4,B0009NZ6N4,This is a great dvd to use as a companion with the book. I taught it in 11th grade and showed part of each interview with the corresponding chapter from the book. I recommend this dvd.,1256515200,,184,4.138888888888889
8063989,5,B0009NZ6N4,"Like many of you, I stayed up late to watch these interviews with Ted Koppel and Morrie Schwartz.

Tonight, I ""just happened to"" see this DVD listed in Documentary Films...WOW!  I absolutely couldn't believe my eyes!  Thank you God and Everybody for making this long lost programming available for our home libraries.  I am grateful.

The tender expertise of Koppel's questions to Morrie about his daily dealings with death, and the absolutely honest, insightful and extremely private feelings Morrie so generously shared with all of us (his loving friends), makes this film an unparalled look into the closing chapter of life.

I am a better human being, having seen ""Lessons on Living.""

8063990,5,B0009NZ6N4,"Although a lot of people I spoke with have heard of Tuesdays with Morrie, no one had seen it on television. After watching the interview with Ted Koppel it brought out a lot of insight into how one thinks at the end of life knowing we all would like more time with our loved ones and those close to us. Living day by day wondering if the choices we make to extend that time are the best ones for us and those around us.",1228089600,,419,4.0
8063991,5,B0009NZ6N4,An excellent teacher and role model for facing death in such a difficult circumstances with unbelievable grace and dignity.,1217376000,,123,5.526315789473684
8063992,5,B0009NZ6N4,"Lessons in living is what life is all about. Ted's interviews with Morrie bring life to the forefront. My only wish is that I never met with Morrie Schwartz. What two wonderful men

8063993,4,B0009NZ6N4,"Absolutely a priceless documentary which we all will be able to relate to since we all must someday face our own death and/or that of those we love.  These interviews by Ted Koppel with Morrie give a wonderful view of a wonderful older man's experience of the downhill slope of ALS and his impending death.  His expression of his thoughts with such great honesty and insight are priceless and life-changing.  Since my daughters' father at age 57 was just diagnosed with ALS and is already using a wheel chair, I got the DVD for them to see. They really felt appreciative and comforted in a bittersweet way from seeing this one of a kind documentary of Morrie.  They both also read the book ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" which is also a ""must read""!!",1212969600,,742,4.598484848484849
8063994,5,B0009NZ6N4,"I read ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" and was very curious to see what Morrie looked like, as well as seeing the ""real"" Morrie.  What a special man!!  Ted Koppel was one of my favorite interviewers.  It was nice to see the soft spot Ted had for Morrie.  This DVD gives you the opportunity to see Morrie in all his modest greatness.  He must have been an exceptional teacher/professor.",1211673600,,376,4.552238805970149
8063995,5,B0009NZ6N4,I am very happy with my purchases. This addition reinforces all the positive points of the movie. I believe this dvd along with the movie Tuesdays with Morrie should be in every families movie collection. I first saw the movie when first presented by Oprah years ago. It definitely helped me to look at life with a new pair of eyes.,1184976000,2,332,4.459016393442623
