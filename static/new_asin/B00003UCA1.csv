1332776,3,B00003UCA1,"I purchased two Pilates videos last January and began using them on regular basis. The Denise Austin video is better at strength building.  Occasionally I use Dynamic Firming and Flexing to vary the muscle groups, but I never feel as if I have received the full benefit from the time spent.",999216000,6,290,4.686274509803922
1332777,3,B00003UCA1,"Many of the ""Method"" workout tapes have Pilates but in this case only a small portion is dedicated to the Pilates, it is mostly stretching.  That's right stretching.  This whole tape is stretching and not like the ""Precision Toning"" tape where Pilates is used but like before you get moving, painfully slow and repetitive stretching.  I wasn't expecting this to be so basic, I was expecting just Pilates.",997056000,6,404,4.911764705882353
1332778,5,B00003UCA1,"Each of the workouts on this tape (each about 15-20 minutes) is a great way to wake up my stiff lower back each morning.  I have found that since I started doing at least one of the segments daily, I feel less stiff and definitely more flexible. The segments incorporate some basic Yoga and other stretching positions that are easy and effective.  The instructor, Lakey, is very thorough in her explanations on how to execute the moves.  This video is also part of a 3-part set of the The Method's ""Dynamic"" series, which I am also using to get this body moving.  Anyone familiar with The Method's other videos and have found them a bit advanced, would do well to start with this series first.  I would recommend this to anyone who thinks that because they have aches and pains they cannot exercise.  This is a great way to get started.",970704000,40,836,4.503311258278146
7919374,1,B00003UCA1,The picture is so misleading.  The person on the cover isn't seen talking or in the group of men and women doing the stretching.  No real music.  A harp is being played.  So boring and slow moving.  I am stuck with it. Waste of money.  Doesn't even deserve one star.,1474934400,,266,4.22
7919375,3,B00003UCA1,I like all of the videos that are instructed by Jenifer.,1472774400,,56,4.181818181818182
7919376,3,B00003UCA1,The exercises are well illustrated and very helpful.  The drum beats in the background are VERY distracting.,1421625600,,108,5.352941176470588
7919377,5,B00003UCA1,"This is my favorite, go to stretching tape.  As long as I use it, I'm more flexible and comfortable.  Less body pain.",1408752000,,117,4.2727272727272725
7919378,4,B00003UCA1,"We were looking for a stretching exercise regimen.  This is fine, working upper and lower body parts, and illustrating modifications for the less flexible.  We discovered that we needed more floor space to avoid bumping into each other while we tried this in our family room at home.",1397433600,,283,4.875
7919379,1,B00003UCA1,"This is not worth the money. It is not put together well,at all. There are a lot more stretching dvds that are really good.",1368057600,,123,4.166666666666667
7919380,4,B00003UCA1,"Luckily, I'm familiar with yoga moves (at this point!). I was surprised that the blonde woman on the cover of the DVD is NOT the dark-haired woman who instructs on the DVD! (Lakey Evans) This is the first The Method DVD I've tried. I was pleasantly surprised when I went through the entire DVD a couple mornings ago, and realized an entire hour had passed. Wow! The moves on the DVD weren't difficult at all (I do AM PM Stretching with Madeleine Lewis frequently) and I ended up doing many of the stretches at a more advanced level than the demonstrators for the less flexible.

Evans was slightly annoying in the second stretch routing with a verbal tic ""yah?"" every stretch movement. But other than that, I liked following her movements, her directions were good, and the stretches lasted a good 30 seconds or more, giving muscles time to catch up to the moves.

I couldn't quite get over the live drum band behind the exercise crew! At some points, the sound made it hard to hear Lakey clearly (the sound editor goofed) but that was corrected in the rest of the DVD.

I like the variety for stretching this DVD gives me, but overall, I still prefer AM PM Stretching with Madeleine Lewis--her routines are 30 to 20 minutes and efficiently get you all stretched out without rushing the stretches.",1350086400,,1297,4.606060606060606

Just delightful!  Makes Pilates much easier to do.",1276646400,,79,5.0
7919382,5,B00003UCA1,"""The Method Dynamic Firming & Flexing"" workout is a peaceful escape from your daily challenges. Lakey Evans guides you through three target specific workouts. You can do all the workouts in one day and spend one full hour or you can choose from a Total Body Workout, Upper Body Workout or Lower Body Workout.

Total Body Flexibility (16 minutes) - A head-to-toe conditioning workout that will give your entire body a boost of energy. In this segment, your body will warm nicely and your arms and legs will tingle with all the new blood flow. You will do some side stretches, lots of forward bending.

Upper Body Flexibility (23 minutes) - Helps to tone the muscles of the neck, shoulder girdle and upper back. Dissolves stress and tension. As you continue into this segment, you will feel invigorated. Still, you are moving slowly. There are lots of creative transitions and you stretch and tone more than just your upper body. You get down on the floor and enjoy lots of deep stretching now that your muscles are warmed up. You will need an exercise band here for the floor workout.

Lower Body Flexibility (21 minutes) - Release stress in the lower back, hip, knee and ankle joints. You start with standing and then move into downward dog, cobra and cat pose. Lots of creative stretching for areas you really need to work on. You will also need an exercise band here.

This DVD workout is a combination of Yoga, Pilates and Precision Firming with live percussion and harp. If you are familiar with yoga, you will recognize the sun salutations, plank position, cobra, cat pose. The vinyasa style yoga with postures flowing spontaneously in a smooth sequence makes this an enjoyable and relaxing routine.

If you want to move lymph around in your body, this Firming and Flexing workout should do it. The exercises have a nice full range of motion.

""You have more lymphatic fluid in your body than blood. Lymph bathes every cell, playing an important role in immunity and detoxification. ...yoga is great for improving lymphatic circulation."" ~pg. 156, The Metabolic Plan by Stephen Cherniske

Portions of this workout reminded me of some of the movements in ""The Method All In One Workout."" The difference is that all the exercises in this DVD are slow and controlled. If there are any dance movements, they are done while standing in one place. There is no fancy footwork here! Thankfully.

Lakey Evans gives excellent instruction and educates you in many things, like listening to your body to know how far you should go in a stretch. This perhaps one of the best ""All-Over-Body Stretches"" you will ever experience. I like using this workout in the evenings.

You will need: Yoga Mat, Exercise band (better than a towel)

Results: You will feel taller, stronger and move like a dancer.

Alternate this DVD with any workout or for a total body makeover, use this DVD in combination with the Method Dynamic Toning and Method Dynamic Cardio workouts.
