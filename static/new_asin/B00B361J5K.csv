8562080,3,B00B361J5K,"I really enjoyed the card and I felt it was appropriate given the time the event actually took place.  They did a really good job of putting a patriotic feel on things but the most important part of the card (or at least the main event between Sgt. Slaughter and Hulk Hogan) wasn't even included on the disc.  The buildup to the match was shown and there was even an interview with Sgt. Slaughter promoting the match.  How can you put all the hype on a DVD but not deliver with the payoff?  I'm not sure who actually made the call to not show the Iraq vs. America main event but this card and even the design of the Wrestlemania logo with the stars and stripes were all centered around it so I'm not sure how they would justify (or the sense behind) leaving it out.  If you still plan to order, I will say that the match between Randy Savage and Ultimate Warrior is a great piece of history.  I also enjoyed the Hart Foundation vs. the Nasty Boys and it was a trip down memory lane to see The ""Texas Tornado"" Kerry Von Erich on a WWE card but there just wasn't any chemistry or buildup in his match.  I also enjoyed the Intercontinental Championship match between Mr. Perfect and Big Bossman.  Many of the matches didn't seem to have much of a buildup (or last that long) but it was still a decent card.  My guess is they were simply placed there in between the bigger and more meaningful matches.  The DVD is, eh OK, but they need to deliver the main event or at least let people know it isn't included beforehand.  Picture quality was nothing to write home about but was fair enough.  I just wouldn't advise buying this DVD and getting a conversion over to HD or anything like that.  If you ordered this on PPV back in 1991 I would say the picture is about identical to what you would have seen then.  I believe it was pretty much just dubbed over to DVD from the original footage with no bells or whistles.  It was also nice that they split everything up into chapters.  There are a few matches that I will probably watch again at some point and it is going to be nice to not have to sit through the whole card.",1364860800,,2114,4.234413965087282
8562081,4,B00B361J5K,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

I'll go on record saying this is the most controversial WrestleMania of all time that had a ""Superstars & Stripes Forever"" theme complete with the Mania logo in red & white & blue colors with American flags hung around the arena but originally set to take place in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum only to be moved to the L.A. Sports Arena as WWE decided to do an angle playing off the current Gulf War that turned off & offended viewers to the point where they claim the move was due to death threats made towards the company while the other story was that it was moved due to lack of ticket sales due of the storyline.  Various celebrities involved include Regis Philbin, Alex Trebek, and Marla Maples while various celebrities were in the crowd as well with Willie Nelson singing ""America The Beautiful.""  This event also featured the WrestleMania debuts of various superstars & legends like Sgt. Slaughter, Kerry Von Erich, Nasty Boys, japanese superstars Tenryu & Kitao, and one other superstar who I'll get to later.

The WWE Championship was defended by Sgt. Slaughter with General Adnan against Hulk Hogan in the controversial angle where former patriot Slaughter denounced America in favor of being an Iraq sympathizer causing Hogan to take the role of the American hero while Slaughter made it clear that he was playing under a new set of rules where he admitted that he had no problems getting disqualified or counted out because that meant that he still remained champion.  The other attraction match on this card was Randy Savage vs. Ultimate Warrior in a Retirement Match that has gone down as one of the greatest matches in their careers but also very memorable for the aftermath that made this not only my favorite WrestleMania moment of all night to this day but was so emotional that you saw audience members in the crowd crying tears of joy.  Another match that wasn't memorable at that time but is now looking back in time was not only the WrestleMania debut of The Undertaker vs. Jimmy Snuka but also the beginning of what has gone down in history as ""The Streak"".  Other matches include Tag Team Champions Hart Foundation vs. Nasty Boys, Intercontinental Champion Mr. Perfect vs. Big Boss Man, Ted Dibiase vs. his former bodyguard in Virgil who had Roddy Piper in his corner, Jake Roberts vs. Rick Martel in a Blindfold Match, Tito Santana vs. Mountie, Legion Of Doom vs. Power & Glory, Greg Valentine vs. Earthquake, British Bulldog vs. Warlord, Texas Tornado vs. Dino Bravo, Rockers vs. Haku & Barbarian, and Demolition vs. Genichiro Tenryu & Koji Kitao in what was a crossover appearance for an upcoming tour of Japan was being co-promoted with WWE.

This was the first WrestleMania I can recall where a majority of the matches from the main events to the undercard had a buildup to it as all the matches were solid while others did their job along with giving us some WrestleMania moments that still stand out to this day.  In the end, this is one Mania that if you can get past the entire Gulf War angle & controversy surrounding this event that I would definitely add to the collection.",1364601600,2,3425,4.704507512520868
