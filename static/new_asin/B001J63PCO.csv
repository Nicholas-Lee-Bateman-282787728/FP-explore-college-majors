3652117,5,B001J63PCO,"This beautiful film offers an insight into the artistic passion that set Maynard Dixon apart from the American painters who merely trailed along under the influence of the European Impressionists.

As an artist, I've long admired Maynard Dixon's masterful ability to paint both luminous skies, and the play of shadows across broad landscapes. Dixon captured a tangible essence of the American West, but his appeal goes far beyond that of the regional painter. Maynard Dixon Art and Spirit offers the audience the opportunity to see a sumptuous number of master works from private and museum collections.

Just as priceless are the interviews with Maynard Dixon's family. Dixon was Dorothea Lange's first husband. In filmed interviews, their two sons and Dixon's granddaughter from his first marriage recount their memories. Jayne McKay's biographical script weaves Dixon's complicated life together into a fascinating story. The Western Writers of American awarded the film Best Documentary of 2008.

I love the soundtrack. The talented John McEuen performs his evocative score on a variety of traditional instruments. McEuen brings life to this fascinating documentary about an artist who, during the first half of the 20th century, made himself at home both in the sophisticated Bohemian world of San Francisco, and whenever possible, painted his canvases while he lived with traditional Native Americans.

This film captures the essence of Maynard Dixon's life in a way that no book can.",1225065600,7,1490,5.4094827586206895
3652118,5,B001J63PCO,"This Spur Award-winning documentary is simply outstanding, a vivid look at one of the West's great painters. Even if you're not familiar with the work of Maynard Dixon, this documentary is worth watching. The narrative is superb, and the subject is an artist whose story had to be told. A first-rate film!",1224892800,4,305,4.884615384615385
3652139,4,B001J63PCO,"I feel that this narrative of the life of Maynard Dixon was very nicely put together.
I have done a fair amount of research on Maynard Dixon and was impressed with the quality

Creator Jayne McKay and her team take viewers on a detailed journey of a great artist's life and artistic manifestations.  I've watched it twice all the way through and could do it over and over again.  It's a superb film for entertainment, history and visceral satisfaction.",1321056000,,344,4.896551724137931
3652141,5,B001J63PCO,"I was recently quite lucky to get my hands on this wonderful documentary about Maynard Dixon.  I have always admired his work but I honestly didn't know the breadth and range of his amazing contribution to the art world.  This film offers an incredible retrospective of the various stages of Dixon's drawings, watercolors, oils and murals.  Jayne McCay has created a film that not only gives one an in depth look at Dixon's work but she also very capably interweaves that with the story of Dixon's life.  He was a complicated and intense man and this film shows that through revealing historical photos of Dixon, the time period he lived in and interviews with friends and family.  I loved that his children participated in this film.  It gives the film a richness and insightfulness that is often missing in bio documentaries.  I feel very fortunate that this film gave me the opportunity to have a better appreciation for Maynard Dixon and his amazing work.",1315872000,,959,4.810975609756097
3652142,5,B001J63PCO,"Jayne McKay's documentary is a thoughtful, careful crafting of the life, career, and of course, magnificent artwork of one of the foremost icons of art in the American West.  Perhaps Maynard Dixon's most important works are those he produced in a highly personalized and subtly stylized form of modernism - where forms are distilled to their flattened essence and color is intensified and saturated to convey his response to the Western landscape he loved so much.  In much the same way, McKay paints a visually compelling story that presents the essential details and impressions of Dixon's life and works in a manner that allows the viewer to become immediately drawn into, and held by, the narrative.  In spite of the exhaustive number and complexity of resources utilized in the making of this film (including rare archival footage, extensive photographs, interviews with family, researchers, collectors and dealers, etc.) all are woven into a unified tapestry that allows the viewer to absorb a considerable amount of material in a relaxed, straightforward, and enjoyable manner.  The visual anchor of the film is of course Dixon's art, presented mostly chronologically, lavishly, and unhurriedly.  As biographer for artist Ray Strong, one of Dixon's close friends and students over the last decade plus of his life, I was especially delighted to see Strong's insightful commentary (delivered in grand style) blended into the film.  Strong's direct experience with Dixon as a fellow artist of the 30s and 40s offers insights no others can provide: that from the artist's point of view.  John McEuen's musical score seems to richly and appropriately capture the spirit and Western feel of the film, adding to it without intruding upon the story.  The selection of Diane Keaton as narrator is a surprising, but effective choice - perhaps highlighting the importance of the various feminine muses in Dixon's life.",1309737600,3,1915,5.235294117647059
3652143,5,B001J63PCO,"This is a great documentary that told the story of a fascinating artist.  I has seen some Maynard Dixon paintings in museums over the years, but never got the full impact of his talent until seeing so many of his great paintings together.

3652145,5,B001J63PCO,"i was not all that familiar with maynard dixon's work. i was familiar, however, with daniel dixon and the creator of this film, jayne mckay. i worked for many years with daniel at ogilvy & mather and we spoke more to his mother's photography because this was my hobby & passion. jayne is the sister of one of my best friends in high school. she lived right across the street for many years.

i start out my review with these facts because i felt it was necessary to state the extent of knowledge...or lack thereof...for the subject of jayne's film.

this is an extraordinary piece of work -- enlightening, informative, thought-provoking, and totally inspiring. jayne has managed to take still photos and bring them alive to the viewer. her factual ""storytelling"" rivals that of ken burns and certainly kept me engaged to the very end. the interviews with family members were excellent...what each had to say only further enhanced the story of this incredible artist.

the film will draw you in and take you on a fascinating journey that you won't want to end. thanks to jayne, whether you know about maynard dixon or not, the film is a delightful education of the man's ""art and spirit"".",1298678400,,1187,4.72463768115942

3652147,5,B001J63PCO,"Jayne MacKay's ""Maynard Dixon: Art and Spirt"" is an extraordinary documentary. This film is a lush portrait of artist Maynard Dixon's work and the landscape that inspired him. Diane Keaton's soothing voice over along with the visuals of majestic southwestern landscape makes viewing this film an educational, delightful and relaxing treat.",1278288000,,339,5.666666666666667
3652148,5,B001J63PCO,"Eat your heart out Ken Burns. Jayne McKay shows us how it's done. You'll be swept along, blown away and come away filled with new knowledge of a genius artist moving through extraordinary times and unseen places, capturing it all like a Leonardo on horseback. Leonardo because Maynard Dixon was as revolutionary an artist for his time. And because Dixon drew endlessly, leaving thousands of sketches, each a miniature masterwork. And when he painted, the Great Mystery reveals itself in light fantastic.

If you don't know Maynard Dixon, see this film. In minutes, McKay captures an entire life, the sort we all aspire to live: bold, adventurous, and productive beyond belief. See it for the art because genius is a wonder to behold.

This film is such a surprise with it's eye popping, mind bending art, with it's prehistoric landscapes and Earth's native children, with it's `You Are There' quality as our country transforms from the Wild West (the unseen real one Dixon captured and the fantasy one that he regretted helping create - such juicy irony) into the tamer but still awesome South West that we know today.

You get all this and Diane Keaton too, though you wouldn't know it because she does exactly what a great actress must do when narrating, she finds the perfect pitch of personality to engage us in the matter at hand but not in herself. Of course, once you know it's her, you can't help but thinking, `cool, yeah, that's Diane Keaton.'

Be entertained! Be very entertained! Be enriched and wiser too. Treat yourself to this film, this art, this rip-roaring slice of history, this giant of man, his art, life and times.",1259020800,2,1636,4.8113879003558715
3652169,5,B001J63PCO,"I will enjoy watching this film over and over again.  Maynard Dixon was the master of shadow and light, and so completely captured the awesome beauty of the all too often underappreciated arid West.  The musical score and narration are the perfect compliments to the stunning imagery created by Maynard Dixon. For anyone who appreciates the best in Western Art, this film is a must watch.",1240704000,2,388,4.863636363636363
3652170,5,B001J63PCO,"If this is a first introduction to this brilliant artist, how lucky is the viewer to meet Dixon this way. The film rolls out like a dream revealing the breadth of a man's life, his range of vision and depth of soul,as well as his passion for place.

McKay has exceeded the biographical film format. Somehow,this production raises the bar above any similar effort, in part due to the soundtrack,
narration, script and sheer power of the sequence of images and intensity of the editing. A wonderful film to see, to own and to give.",1237852800,2,529,4.568421052631579
3652171,5,B001J63PCO,"At the Western Writers of America Convention in Scottsdale, AZ last June 2008, I sat at the table with Jayne McKay.  Since I am an artist, we got into a discussion in which Jayne told me about this wonderful film that she made and Diane Keaton narrated.  Finally, I made time yesterday to watch it.  It is absolutely excellent.  I knew of Maynard Dixon, but not much about his life and work, even that he had lived in Tucson, where I lived for several years.

Watching the film and listening to all the people admire his clouds, makes me excited because I, too, like the life and soul in clouds.  People tell me they like the way I paint clouds.  Often I wonder if I should put more stuff in my landscapes.  BUT, after watching Maynard Dixon: Art and Spirit, I jump with joy knowing I can be true to myself and KISS (Keep it Simple Sweetie).  Thank you.

Now, I will stop and get back to drawing and painting.",1231113600,2,909,4.294117647058823
3652172,5,B001J63PCO,"I discovered Maynard Dixon while visiting the gallery district in Scottsdale, AZ while on vacation in 2001.  There was a book, Desert Dreams, that opened my eyes to the work of a master. How he missed my notice before then is beyond me. I'm an Atlanta artist and I'm in love with the Southwest. This documentary was beautifully done, so much so that on my recent return to Arizona this fall, I visited some of the places that were mentioned. I've shown it to my local artists group. Whether you're an artist or not, experiencing Dixon and his work through this beautifully created documentary is like a short trip to that vast, spiritually stimulating part of our country. Of all of the artists I've seen, Dixon captures the cultural richness, spirit and magnificence like nobody else. And Jayne McKay has showcased it all perfectly. No wonder it's an award winner.",1228348800,2,865,4.766666666666667
3652173,5,B001J63PCO,"Maynard Dixon: Art and Spirit is an exquisitely beautiful documentary. It is hard to imagine that any other introduction to Maynard Dixon's life and art could be as graceful, insightful, or respectful as is this film.  It also inspires the viewer to learn more about Western art and the unique breed of artists of Dixon's time and place.",1228003200,2,337,4.810344827586207
3652174,5,B001J63PCO,"In 2008, the Western Writers of America awarded this video, MAYNARD DIXON: ART AND SPIRIT, a Spur Award for ""Best Western Documentary.""  This video also won an ""Artistic Excellence Award"" at the 2008 Paso Robles Digital Film Festival.  In viewing MAYNARD DIXON: ART AND SPIRIT it is immediately apparent that this video deserves both these awards--and hopefully more.

This is an extraordinary video documentary about an extraordinary American artist.  Jayne McKay's presentation is especially effective for several reasons.  First, the video is remarkably rich in presenting visual material.  Dixon's art--his oils, his watercolors, his sketches, and his murals--have a distinctive and powerful aesthetic appeal.  McKay's inclusion of historical photographs, contemporary photographs, historical video footage, and contemporary video footage all help the viewer better understand the world in which Dixon lived.  Second, Diane Keaton and cowboy singer Don Edwards provide professional and compelling narration.  Third, Grammy-winner John McEuen of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band wrote the accompanying soundtrack--one that is both soothing and sublime.  Fourth, the documentary includes video interviews with Maynard Dixon's two sons and a granddaughter; these interviews give ART AND SPIRIT an added intimacy and bring the viewer closer to Maynard Dixon himself.  Finally, an perhaps most important, MAYNARD DIXON: ART AND SPIRIT is wonderfully successful in presenting not only Maynard Dixon's art, but also in presenting Maynard Dixon the artist, Maynard Dixon the man, and the world--or worlds--in which Maynard Dixon lived.

Although we will never be able to fully understand the Maynard Dixon, this documentary--wonderfully written, visually rich, and emotionally intimate--probably brings us as close as we can hope to get to understanding, in a sublime and romantic sense, his art and spirit.

3652175,5,B001J63PCO,"Jayne Mc Kay's  "" Maynard Dixon: Art and Spirit ""  is a beautiful and entertaining film, but more important it is a truthful and informative look at a pivotal individual, not only in the area of Western Art but as an important American artist in general.

 Jayne approaches Maynard as a complete person, not just through his art works.  The creations ( paintings, sketches, drawings, prints, etc. ) are shown in the context in which he lived and worked combined with a wonderful collection of personal period photography from childhood to his death. You don't just look at his life, you experience it with him.

 The combination of powerful imagery, saturated with color, and a stimulating sound track helps to give a greater understanding of this sometimes flamboyant, moody, complex personality: Maynard Dixon, one of America's more inspirational masters.  This film goes beyond the world of art; it is an important ""must"" for anyone with any interest in early 20th century American history.",1226275200,2,993,5.049079754601227
3652176,5,B001J63PCO,"Maynard Dixon: Art and Spirit invited me to see the West through Dixon's eyes and gain a new appreciation for his art, the sere landscape, and the times in which he lived. As Dixon imbued his paintings with meaning, this fascinating film made me feel what it must have been like for him to travel to where ""even the buckboards couldn't go"" and to wring beauty from hardship.

The film presents a treasure trove of Dixon's art that contrasts with  modern-day footage of many areas where he painted. This technique allowed me to understand how his art made the West his own and even helped me to look at clouds differently after the movie ended and I stepped outside.

A great story, a gorgeous score by John McEuen, Diane Keaton's warm and sensitive narration, lively interviews with Dixon family members, and renowned photographer Dorothea Lange's recollections of her marriage to Dixon are a few of the additional elements that make this film an unforgettable must-see.",1226188800,,970,4.866666666666666
3652177,5,B001J63PCO,"This is an interesting and rich film about art and the west. It offers a rare insight into what inspired the artist, Maynard Dixon, and kept inspiring him for a lifetime. This documentary shows the evolution of Dixon's style in an evocative and comprehensive way. The combination of the sumptuous paintings, period photographs, voice-over narrative and music make the film a satisfying and engrossing experience. Dixon's perception of the west is not dry, desolate and monochromatic but he shows it to be a place alive with color, light, and texture-- and those skies!",1225670400,,568,5.118279569892473
3652178,5,B001J63PCO,"I had the Maynard Dixon imprint in my head long before I actually knew who he was. Who could not look at the sky on a sunny day in the American Southwest and see those cloud patterns without wondering the name of the artist who captured them so uniquely. I made the connection at first with the gorgeous Dixon prints on some of the dust covers of Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove saga. Then I viewed ""Maynard Dixon: Art and Spirt"" and got the rest of the story. Jayne McKay's superb documentary is a dreamy voyage through not only the history of Dixon's life and work, but also a reverie of an American era that produced some really great art. This DVD should be in the collection of all Dixon fans as well as lovers of the solitude and majesty of the lower left corner of our beautiful country. Diane Keaton's narration sounds like a labor of love, which I suspect it is. Buy it!",1225324800,2,878,4.359756097560975
8311992,5,B001J63PCO,"WONDERFUL!  The day we got this film, we watched it twice in a row - what a pleasure!  The visuals enabled us to see Dixon's work in surprising clarity and it was incredible being able to gaze into his paintings. The depth and color are stunning!  I ended up with a much better understanding of Maynard Dixon himself, and also his surroundings.  I like the way this film presents the facts and their sources and especially enjoyed the interviews with his family.  There were even photographs of drawings he did as a child,  The painstaking research in this documentary is so informative and transports the viewer back into a different era, into various pockets of the west, each with its own unique culture and group of people.  There are also rare photographs from the Dixon family along with Maynard's written observations of the places he went and the people he met.  Highly recommend to anyone who likes history, the west, art, or just an entertaining account of a mysterious character who influenced the way our nation perceived the west.",1499472000,,1043,4.787709497206704
8311993,5,B001J63PCO,"As a Scenic Artist, I have often been asked to recreate existing artworks of all styles, periods, sizes and types, to a varying degree of exactitude. Whenever a ""western"" style of  of easel art was required for a project, the direction was not towards Remington or O'Keefe, but Dixon, who style perfectly embodies not only the color and expanse of the West, but of greater value, the spirituality, both in the intimate portraits of its inhabitants and the broad views of the landscapes. This documentary captures all these facets of Dixons work as well as the deeply personal motivations that prompted his fascination and love of this part of the country. While many documentaries tend to lose their focus on the artists work, this one does not. There is an incredible amount of his work illustrated, beginning with drawings of his youth and then progressing chronologically throughout his life, clearly depicting how events in his life influenced his painting, both in style and subject. Its all about the work, and the seamless progression of an artists life, beautifully photographed, narrated and scored.",1454630400,,1108,5.087912087912088

8311997,5,B001J63PCO,"Something in the end credits says a lot of Art and Spirit: the section acknowledging the sources of the films images rolls on and on and on. I actually waited for it to finish out of curiosity and was blown away by how many institutions and people (including Steve Martin, who knew?) the filmmakers approached to access Dixon's artwork.

They needed all these paintings, drawings and sketches because Art and Spirit is grounded in the artist's own work. This is great because Dixon's paintings are breathtaking, yet peaceful at the same time, so watching a parade of his art across the screen is a pleasure and takes you on a trip to these places.

Starting from the artist's childhood in central California, when famous Western painter Frederic Remington advised a 16-year-old Dixon to ""Draw, draw, draw,"" the film present's his life and career at a nimble pace.

I have admired Dixon from afar, buying a poster in a museum gift shop here, perusing an online gallery there, but I'm glad I took this deeper dive into his work. Dixon has a style, but there is also a lot of variety in his paintings, and watching the film I was surprised to see how much he evolved over his career. The film also shows you his Depression-era street scenes, a departure for the artist, which I had no idea of.

For me some of the most thrilling parts of the film touch on Dixons experiences wandering in Indian country. One of his sons, thinking back to the times when his dad would take a trip and ramble around the Southwest, wonders amusedly, ""Where the hell was he? What was he doing?"" Dixon fell in love with the region and it's native cultures, and the filmmakers do a good job of showing you that passion and enthusiasm. Dixon is quoted in the film saying of the Hopi, a favorite subject, ""They are here in the midst of this age of steel and electricity; a little remnant of the stone age."" The film will inspire you to explore the West yourself.

One of my quibbles with the film is the inconsistency in the shooting of the interviews. Also, I would have liked if the film allowed itself to examine more critics or personal struggles in the artistnot that I know of any specifically associated with Dixon, but nobody is perfect and everybody has issues, even great men and women.

Ultimately, this film will inspire because, as it presents, Dixon was a man who followed his passion, as when he left his cozy commercial work in New York City and moved back West, or when he moved his family to Taos, New Mexico for a year during the Depression. Art and Spirit is a visual feast and satisfying introduction to Maynard Dixon.",1408233600,,2611,4.568376068376068

It proved to be a thrilling introduction to the work of a master previously unknown to me. This film is a wonderfully balanced survey of the man's life and artistic work. It is a work of art in itself and the balance of writing, visual presentation of Dixon's work and John McKuen's evocative but never intrusive music are well worth your time and expense to experience.",1398816000,,537,4.78494623655914

The film was more than well received each time. It offers a visual and musical pacing of the life of Dixon; it is not just endearing but enduring and a tribute to Dixons genius, as well as to Jayne McKay and her crew for delivering it to us. Seeing it multiple times reveals just how layered it is with information, details, emotion. It offers a great sense of the west and the man who attempted to captured for us it in paint and in perpetuity. Dixon didn't just paint clouds, but gave the viewer all that was necessary for contrast below and beyond the clouds. This film is like a canvas that has been painted by Dixon himself.
