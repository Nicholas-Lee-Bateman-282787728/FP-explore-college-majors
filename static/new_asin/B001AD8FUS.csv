8277035,1,B001AD8FUS,"I purchased this DVD and failed to pay close attention to the previous reviewer (DrNoRush). The DVD jacket claims that this Movie stars Bella Cortez (the Cuban beauty of Sword and Sandal fame), and Ken Clark. This is deceptive advertising - she is not in this movie, and neither is he! Don't be fooled.",1283212800,,302,4.611111111111111
8277036,2,B001AD8FUS,"The title of this DVD is correct:  ""None But The Lonely Spy"".  However, it is a B/W film that does NOT feature Ken Clark and Bella Cortez, and it is not  ""FBI Appelle Istamboul"".  I don't know where Sinister Cinema pulled this cover image from, but it is not associated with ""None But The Loney Spy"" - which is film that you will receive.",1274486400,2,338,4.234375
