4062767,5,B0033240BC,I was very impressed with the people of the town and the fact that stepahnie meyer went there and did her research. and this book was just not based on fiction it was based on the stories from the town and their beliefs. That alot of this truley could be real.  I was watching something on history channel and they say that Vampires truly could be among us!,1271203200,,357,4.25
4062768,5,B0033240BC,"I enjoyed this even though I would not call myself a ""Twi-hard"". It documents the rise of a phenomenon that is fascinating on so many levels, fan or not. The natural scenery is beautiful and a part that really stuck with me was a woman from the Forks Chamber of Commerce saying ""They [the fans] come here for Twilight, but they return for Forks"".",1271030400,,346,4.421875
4062769,1,B0033240BC,I loved the movies and the books. However this DVD was nothing but boring to me.,1270166400,2,80,4.0625
4062770,5,B0033240BC,"This documentary did a fantastic job of showing us the ""real"" Forks Washington.  The one Stephanie wrote about and the one I envision while reading this Saga.  If you can put the movies out of your mind for the time it takes to watch this I think you will be pleasantly surprised. (You must stop comparing the movies to this DVD, the books, my friends, it is about the books). Stephanie clearly did her homework!  Any true ""Twi-hard"" will not only buy this DVD, but will appreciate the significance of it, especially if you do not live in the Pacific Northwest and may never have the opportunity to visit. Thanks to those who made it possible to see the Forks Washington that Stephanie Meyer so elegantly depicted in her story.",1269820800,35,727,4.576923076923077
4062771,2,B0033240BC,"This DVD was much too long. I love the Twilight books and movies! Although,I don't understand the hype over a place that was just a location for a fictional story.??  The places in the town labeled The Cullen House or The Swan House were not used in the movie. They are just houses the sound like the description in the book. It sounds like the town has gone a little crazy.  It is wonderful that the economy is taking off with all the tourists visiting and spending money there. I just am surprised that people will travel all the way there when Edward, Bella, and Jacob actually live in Hollywood!

If you are a die hard Twilight fan, you will probably enjoy this film. If you are on a budget, I would pass and get something else.

The local people in the interviews were really kind, warm people and that is probably why Forks is doing so well.  Twilight may have drawn the fans there, but i think that the people that return are there for the beautiful scenery and the friendly folks that live and work there. My favorite local?  Ray Black, Jr...""Jacob's"" grandfather-that is his real name and he has the most twinkly eyes I have ever seen. Loved him!!!  And check out the ""Alice"" look alike...she comes pretty close!",1269388800,6,1221,4.472972972972973
4062772,4,B0033240BC,"Four hours away from Seattle, Washington lies the town of Forks--once a logging town, now revitalized by author Stephanie Meyers' series of young adult books--<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-The-Twilight-Saga-Book-1/dp/0316015849/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Saga-New-Moon/dp/0316075639/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Saga: New Moon</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eclipse-The-Twilight-Saga/dp/0316027650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eclipse (The Twilight Saga)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Dawn-The-Twilight-Saga-Book-4/dp/031606792X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4)</a>&nbsp;starring vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen and the love of his long life, human teenager Bella Swan.

Approximately 90 minutes, this documentary explores Forks from the perspective of the town's lifeblood--its people.  Sumptuously beautiful with a full spectrum of natural attractions: amazing timberland, the Olympic Natural Park, the windswept beaches of La Push, Rialto and Kalaloch, the Hoh Rain Forest, the Sol Duc Falls, Quileute Indian Reservation land and the intimate setting of a small American town, Forks boasts of a major tourist influx in the last few years since the Twilight books and films have rekindled the romantic imagination of the nation and the world.

For the most part this presentation is geared towards Twilight fans only.  I don't believe anyone other than a die-hard fan would be willing to devote 90 minutes of their time to watch what is basically a travel log outlining the phenomenal growth of an otherwise declining town in desperate need of revitalization from a once booming timber industry.

Along came Stephanie Meyers and her cast of centuries old vampires and the Quileute werewolves to infuse the dying area with new blood in the form of tourists and business.

Mainly a compendium of various local interviews, ""Twilight in Forks"" acts as a huge thank you card to all the Twilight fans from grateful townspeople who so enjoy sharing their lives and the place they live with Twi-heads all around the United States and the world.  Highlighted is the Twilight tour which escorts a mini-busload of the books' lovers to noted points of interest--the Swan residence, the Cullen House, the Forks High School, Jacob Black's house and La Push beach and interviews with two Quileute elders who explain the tribe's actual relationship with shape shifting wolves that are featured so prominently in the books.

Of course, there is a concentration on the fans who have arrived in droves and have actually moved to Forks as well as teachers, website bloggers and the MTV Twilight Tuesday segment host who attempt to explain the love affair between the books, characters and the people who cannot get enough of the whole series and their associated films.

Bottom line?  If you love Twilight and are curious about the town of Forks in Washington State, you will probably enjoy this 90 minute presentation that affords you a townsfolk view of just what its like to live in the Twilight Zone and experience what the popularity of the books and the films have done to revitalize a town once on the decline.  If you are expecting guest appearances from the cast from the films, skip this one as it concentrates on the business men and women who cannot believe their good fortune and the fans who have made an economic bonanza possible and encouragingly sustainable. Recommended and rated only for the die hard Twilight fan.  For those who haven't a clue about this fan phenomenon, find something else to watch.

4062773,4,B0033240BC,"Kind of felt longer than it should have been, but it was neat to see what the real Forks looks like. The movie follows the Twilight Tour and shows all the spots from the book. They spend a lot of time talking to people about the effect the books/movies have had on the town. They talk to some visiting fans as well. It was cool to see interviews with Larry Carroll and Kaleb Nation. They talked to a couple of Quiliute people about their culture as well. Not the best thing I've ever watched, but cool for people like me who will probably never get to Forks, or even for people who've been who want to relive their visit.",1269129600,23,621,4.226890756302521

4062790,4,B0033240BC,Liked the video because it is very informative.  Great for Twilight fans.  It makes me want to go and visit.,1398384000,,108,4.35

4062792,3,B0033240BC,"I was about halfway through it, feeling like a dork, when one of the men interviewed stated that he and his wife actually went so far as to MOVE to Forks. Jigga what? Living the dream? He seemed happy enough to have made the change but...extreme? If they have a daughter you already know what her name is going to be. Blech.
On the plus side it's nice to see this small town flourishing money wise thanks to Meyer.",1392249600,,414,4.253164556962025

4062794,3,B0033240BC,"Loved the Twilight series; this fan movie, not so much. The giggling fangirls had too much screen time. The best was hearing from the local Native Americans who not only spoke eloquently, but were a delight to listen to. The gal at the Chamber of Commerce was also interesting as was the lit professor and his interpretations (read the info on the whiteboard behind him, too). I could have easily sat through a movie on literary interpretations on the series and the psychological insights of this particular fandom. Was very happy to hear that the movies helped this economically hurting town, and they now have a new revenue stream. Their appreciation of Ms. Myer is genuine.",1385164800,,677,4.844827586206897

4062809,3,B0033240BC,"At 84 minutes, this isn't a great Forks video but I think it's better than ""Destination Forks"". You'll get some town history, some dialog from various citizens ( I remember several including business people, teachers, a couple of HS graduates- he was a waste of breath ""yeah, whatever"" sort of stuff, she really seemed to care. There was even a man, a shingle maker, who wasn't a fan himself but OK with Twilight if it helps the town.) you even get some talk from a few visiting fans. Not enough to plan a trip with, and most people won't want to watch it often but worthwhile for a fan collection.",1354492800,,598,4.445454545454545
4062810,3,B0033240BC,I paid next to nothing for this movie so it wasn't wasted. I found the movie sort of dull. As a twilight fan it droned on and on. I gave it to a friend who enjoyed it. Enough said.,1338768000,,180,3.641025641025641

4062813,4,B0033240BC,"Having been a TWILIGHT fan from the beginning  reading all the books  seeing all the films  I ordered the Twilight in Forks video documentary.  There were many interviews by local ""folk"" who ran the different stores etc in Forks.  Althou it could be repetitive at times the information was very interesting.  Of course, my favorite part was showing the areas where a lot of the movie was filmed.  It was worth the price which was very reasonable.",1329868800,,446,4.714285714285714
4062814,2,B0033240BC,"I guess this documentary was sort of informative, but painfully boring.

I had hoped there would be more footage of the town of Forks, but instead this was mostly a bunch of fans talking about how much they love the books and the movies.

4062818,1,B0033240BC,"Since 2007 I have claimed that Fantastic Four Part 2 is the worst movie ever made.  But after seeing this (which is arguably not a movie) I have changed my mind.  It is basically a series of interviews with people who have nothing to say.  They are just basking in their five minutes of fame and making fools of themselves.

I suppose ... that if you are indeed such an adamant twilight fan that four books and 3-5 movies are not enough to satiate you, then you need to take the next step and watch this trash, but really I think you need an intervention.",1300060800,,555,4.257142857142857

It was nice to see how warmly the people of Forks have embraced this story and how it has blessed their little town.  The fact that Stephanie Meyer has placed her story in a real setting, makes her fans want to visit there.  This video satisfies that desire.  You feel like you have visited and talked with people who love the story as much as you do and to know what it is like to live there.  I loved the music to the video as well as I felt it added to that special fairy-tale atmosphere to the area.  I bought this video for myself and then after watching it, ordered it as a gift to other fans I know.

I get the impression that prior to Stephenie Meyer's visit, they may have been in a condition of economic devastation due to a bleak economy with the logging industry, etc., but then came Edward and Bella!  It's heart-warming to know the success of a teenage work of fiction has set the town back in the right direction.
