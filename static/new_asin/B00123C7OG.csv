8243664,5,B00123C7OG,Excellent creation! I could not stop watching episode after episode. Actors are incredible and you can see everyday life in Argentina with all its authentic modern traditions. I LOVED IT!!!!! and would watch it all over again. There is one episode including Paul Mc Cartney (as a character) and it was hilarious! Another one with a president's erotic fantasies and how his wife finally pleased him. Those were my favorite ones.,1268352000,4,427,5.028169014084507
