2883087,5,B000S6TNLI,"This DVD focuses on hand technique.  It focuses not at all on drum set coordination, foot technique, beats, or ""licks"".  Of course, if you master just some of the techniques he explains, particularly the Moeller technique and its variations, your ability to play beats (particularly jazz) and licks (particularly at breakneck speeds) will be greatly enhanced.

I think this is a great instructional video.  The only competition of which I am aware in this particular niche are the Joe Morello technique DVDS.  Morello's DVDs are wonderful and I recommend them, not the least because they have some of Morello's fantastic playing.  But Mayer's DVD is even better than the Morello DVDs.  The principal reason is that Mayer covers a broader range of techniques, ranging from the ""free"" or Gladstone stroke to the Moeller techniques and its variations to the one stroke roll.  In addition, Mayer's explanations of each are as clear, detailed, and understandable as one could possibly want.  Each technique is broken down into constituent elements, explained in depth, depicted both slowly and up to speed, and accompanied by recommended exercises for developing facility with the technique.  There is enough practice material for years.

Mayer is a good person to present the material.  He is not annoying or self-absorbed.  He comes across as sincere, intelligent, knowledgeable, and concerned.

I was not familiar with Mayer before this DVD but am now a real fan.  The segments in which he does some playing are a real treat.  He is versatile, musical, and *incredibly* fast.",1186876800,85,1573,5.158102766798419
2883088,5,B000S6TNLI,"Every drummer should own a copy, regardless of your skill level. Beginners will learn to practice the fundamentals of hand technique properly and efficiently, and more advanced players will benefit from the clear explanations of Jojo's amazing tricks. Gladstone, Moeller, push-pull, one-handed rolls and more are all described very clearly. A great resource to have on your shelf.",1186617600,2,380,5.568965517241379

2883090,5,B000S6TNLI,"What Jojo does with only one hand using his special technique is amazing (""one-hand-roll""). He gives a very detailed introduction to several hand-techniques (especially the ""Moeller""-technique) and explains it in a very  understandable and entertaining way.

You will find a lot of additional information and tips. This is also helpful to understand the background for efficient/economic drumming.

In form, content and concept it is an absolute highlight.",1186099200,,456,5.776119402985074
2883091,5,B000S6TNLI,"This is it! The definitive DVD on stick control, Jojo covers everything I ever wanted to know about finger control, Moeller strokes, and shows us the techniques that will open up our drumming to unlimited possibilities.

He's funny too and explains everything clearly and uses good camera angles and great interludes to keep it fun and groovy.

This is a must have top 10 DVD for drummers and will help anyone at any level, If I only had this 18 years ago when I started playing........",1186099200,2,486,4.6395348837209305
2883092,5,B000S6TNLI,"After a 10 plus year hiatus from playing drums, when I came back I found the web was full or instructional videos and information. First thing I wanted to do was install a fresh set of chops! Google introduced me to Moeller Method, YouTube was where I first saw and heard JoJo Mayer. I did waste money on another Moeller Method video that you should avoid but the purchase of Weapons for the Modern Drummer is money well spent. JoJo is not only a drummer of the high caliber but an excellent teacher as well. There is a wealth of information on this DVD. All of it is well presented with great camera angles and well thought out examples. He shows all the different grips, and goes into detail on Moeller and Gladstone and finger control. His presentation is fresh, humorous and addresses not only the physical aspects of technique but the mental part also. It is all there! He has a great respect for the instrument and it shows. A previous review says this is not for beginners but I'm not sure I agree. I would have loved to had this information when I first started many many years ago. It would have solved many questions I had at the time.",1185494400,53,1145,4.40566037735849
2883093,5,B000S6TNLI,"I've been playing for almost 20 years and seen a lot of instructional videos but I have never gathered as much info on hands as there is in this one. Jojo goes into great detail on the various techniques. His approach is very ""scientific"", breaking stuff down to the smalest nuances, explaining the physics behind it. You can finally start seeing what you've been doing wrong and how to improve it.
I hope he will do more DVDs, on feet etc. Highly recommended.",1184976000,34,460,4.554216867469879
2883094,4,B000S6TNLI,"Jojo Mayer has put together the most detailed video for hand technique. I've spent years asking questions during clinics and to various teachers, regarding variations in hand technique and this is the only video that has been able to answer them.

It may not be good for newer drummers. The basics presented in this video are brief. I also found the level of description for the fundamentals may be above comprehension for a beginner.

This video will provide me with years of hand techniques I can develop.  I recommend it for advancing players and adults.",1184544000,3,557,4.842105263157895

The video actually shows you from different angles, and jojo goes through the motions slowly and thoroughly so you can actually learn, without having to rewind over and over just to get a glimpse of what he's doing (like most drum videos).

This really has helped raise my level of playing. By applying the techniques from this video, playing drums for me has become more fun and exciting, and I can feel the improvement. More importantly, I'm playing more efficiently without straining and pain.",1434153600,,716,4.813008130081301

2883123,5,B000S6TNLI,"When you see reviews that are almost all 5 stars, there is a reason for that. I got this DVD because of the reviews and I wasn't disappointed.

Throughout the DVD, Jojo presents material in an enjoyable and easy-to-understand way. He gives the most thorough explanation of the Moeller technique that I've ever seen. He also demonstrates techniques to improve single and double strokes. He even demonstrates a cool way to quickly switch between match and traditional grip without stopping his playing. It looks like a stick trick, which I guess is kind of cool on its own, but the move actually serves a functional purpose.

Jojo can play faster with one hand than I can with two. But since his explanations are so clear, I'm expecting to improve quite a bit simply because of this DVD.",1402790400,,785,4.7226277372262775

2883125,5,B000S6TNLI,"This production is masterful and a true inspiration. JoJo Mayer presents the subject matter exceptionally well and his technique demonstrations are enhanced by the use of slow motion video, so you can really see what is happening with the hands and fingers.

2883131,5,B000S6TNLI,"Jojo really gets every angle on how to control bounces. I have studied from many books and videos but this title was an eye opener to say the least. The great mystery surrounding the Moeller technique is also unveiled. I will always remember a scene where Jojo whips a long chain across the ground in slow motion. This single demonstration really enabled me to visualize the stroke when learning. He also emphasized that the Moeller stroke be first practiced as 4 hits, not three. I also enjoyed the little solos between each chapter. Every drummer should have this Disc!",1389571200,,571,4.777777777777778

2883135,5,B000S6TNLI,"Not too many people can explain what they do... What I mean by that is this... When it comes to teaching something, whatever that may be, you have folks that are great at their particular craft but are not great at explaing what they do... And vice versa!

Jojo Mayer is NOT that type of individual! When it comes to playing drums, Jojo is the best at explaining and demonstrating what it is that he does. He's the best teacher/clinician that I have ever seen! And, I've seen him twice... Drumming is an art form... Nothing more, nothing less. And, if you want to learn this art form... Learn from Jojo Mayer!",1382918400,,609,4.4375

His explanation and demonstration of the Gladstone (Free Stroke) and Moeller (Whip Stroke) techniques are well thought out and executed. The ""Street Scenes"" clip of Mayer playing a variety of grooves, by itself, is worth checking out and studying. This DVD is focused mainly on stick control technique not on drumset. Unfortunately, the DVD does not cover foot technique for the bass drum and hi hat.",1377216000,,527,5.1395348837209305
2883139,5,B000S6TNLI,"I bought this video based on the video samples on Youtube. If you are wondering whether to buy this video or not, don't, just buy it. It goes from beginner to Jojo's skill. Keep in mind, this is a stick technique video. To find foot tecnique, fills etc... Watch Jojo's drum clinics on Youtube (the one from Sofia is good)... Jojo needs to sit down abd make a Jojo Foot Technique, Fills and Improv and Hi-Hat/Cymbal video. But if you use drumsticks when you play, you need this video. Even if you watch part of the video, it will explain all the physics of drum sticks and grips etc... I wish Jojo had joined a thrash metal or hard rock band back in the day, so everyone would know his name. I love Dave Lombardo (Slayer), Old Metallica, and all the rock drummers you like... But Jojo is truly from another planet. This video helps to explain why... Like a magician revealing the mechanics of his tricks. Please make a bass drum etc etc DVD to go with this Jojo!",1363478400,,961,4.344444444444444
2883140,5,B000S6TNLI,"Jojo has distilled the mechanics of drumming perfectly and scientifically.  Although music is much more than technique, without technique, our vocabulary with which we can express our musical ideas is stunted. As musical as Buddy Rich was, we'd never have enjoyed his playing if not for the fact that his awesome technique gave him unlimited expression. That spark and excitement we all hope for simply cannot be achieved with sloppy, energy depleting technique.  Jojo created a masterpiece of drumming technique here.  He's a great drummer and a master teacher.  Hard to find such a combination!",1362355200,,596,5.242105263157895

2883146,4,B000S6TNLI,"Problem is that the techniques are crazy advanced.  Definitely not a beginners, not even an intermediate dvd.  Maybe not even advanced; probably few drummers will ever master these techniques.
So it comes across more like a talent show.
That said, these are cool techniques and I will practice them.  But they will not be the bread and butter of my routine.  For that
I defer to the much simpler (yet powerful) approach of the Tommy Igoe lifetime hands video.
Time will tell whether these 'super techniques' provide any value to my playing... they may.  But I am not going to let myself be intimidated
by their complexity in the meantime....

2883149,5,B000S6TNLI,"Until a few months ago I had never really heard of Jojo Mayer. I'd seen his name mentioned in comments when I would view some of my favorite drummers on You Tube (Dave Weckl, Steve Smith, Neil Peart, Buddy Rich...) So one day I decided to check out some of his solos. Wow! To say I was blown away was an understatement. Needless to say, when I saw he had a dvd called ""Secret Weapons For The Modern Drummer"" I had to get it. This dvd is incredible. It is an essential tool for drummers of all levels. In the dvd Jojo goes through such things as traditional vs. matched grip, the Moeller technique, the one handed roll, how to warm up, volume & overplaying ... The list goes on and on. I never realized how much there was to just hand technique alone.
Another cool thing in the dvd is Jojo's ""mini solos"" he performs at the end of each segment. Jojo is not only a great drummer, he is a great teacher as well. He comes across in the video as someone who is humble, caring and funny. You can tell he loves what he does. There is so much information in the video you can watch it over and over again and always be learning. I highly recommend this video!",1304208000,,1151,4.165919282511211

2883151,5,B000S6TNLI,"This is an indispensable resource for the aspiring drummer. Jojo goes through the rudiments of basic drumming - the different grips and their advantages, why he uses traditional, strokes, double strokes, controlling bounce, moeller technique, the Mayer stroke, etc. in a clear and engaging manner. In between short sessions are little vignettes of him drumming, which is both amazing and inspiring, as this guy is *fast*. He has clearly studied drumming in great detail, as evidenced from the vocabulary he uses - rotors, axes, etc. - but all is explained nicely.

It'll take a while to master many of the exercises from the Moeller technique onwards, but if you do, you'll be way ahead as a drummer. Looks like it could take years, though :)

The video doesn't look all that hi-def, although it's more than sufficient to follow his tutorials.",1288915200,,843,4.971631205673759

Having many drum dvds in my collection, I must say Jojo's explanation of the various hand techniques, especially the Moeller strokes. This dvd has the most detailed explanation and breakdown of each technique I have seen so far. Slow motion sequences of each technique make it crystal clear exactly what the mechanics of executing each stroke involve. Even a real life teacher might not be able to show you with such clarity how the stroekd are actually executed, step by step, and with tips for mistakes to watch out for. I was able to understand clearly exactly how the various strokes and hand techniques and able to start to review my playing and start to make changes where needed.
This is also an excellent primer for the beginning drummer, as the clear explanations will save them time is groping around for the right way to hold and strike the drums, as many of us have experienced.
Finally, I thought it might be kinda dull - a whole DVD of just hand techniques, but actually I found it really interesting to watch. This will be true for anyone who wants to analyse and improve on their hand techniques, rather than watch some boggling drum solo or independence display. So I have to concur with the readers of Modern Drummer and DRUM magazines, in adding my vote to this DVD as the outstanding one for the year, and perhaps for the last few years. But be warned - it is an extremely focused teaching tool, not a DVD that is meant to entertain, but certainly a must have especially for those drummers at an intermediate and beginner stages. Hey, if you are Dave Weckl, you may not need this DVD, but most drummers will benefit greatly from the lessons within.",1282262400,2,1764,4.5854430379746836

But alas, I'm back to practicing 1/4 notes at 60bpm to ensure I'm swinging the sticks properly.

Incredibly informative DVD, but very talky.
IF you're not totally dedicated to learning the drums, this might not be for you as it's mostly JoJo talking to camera and swinging his sticks in slow motion.

Don't buy it if you're looking for a performance DVD.
Just buy it if you want lessons from the best.

I bought the Thomas Lang DVD and it was like watching a magician.
The Secret Weapons DVD is like a magician giving away his secrets.
Basically this is a true legend of the instrument giving you the most detail he possibly can about efficiency, economy, and clean playing.

2883159,5,B000S6TNLI,This DVD is pretty much a must for anyone who plays drums. I have been playing for a very long time and have had a great deal of professional training but there is always more to learn. As many others have stated this is a hand technique disc...not a showcase of playing or styles or soloing -although in it's own way it is also a showcase ...of hands. For me this has helped refine what skills I already had as well as explore new options (push pull for example) I have had this disc for around 5 months now and my hands already have improved greatly from experimenting with these techniques. They also help you to play easier which is really the key to developing speed. There is always more to learn.,1264032000,,703,4.333333333333333

(The production quality is top-notch, too.)  Note that these two DVDs address hand technique only - nothing other than that - but I'm very glad I spent the money on it; it's more than worth it.  Mayer very clearly explains the German vs. French vs. Traditional grips and shows the incredible power of simple techniques vs. what you might be doing if you didn't know them.  Five stars without a doubt.",1259020800,,545,4.827956989247312
2883162,5,B000S6TNLI,"Jojo Mayer is like Jesus of hand technique, and this is one of the most important DVDs a drummer could ever purchase. BUY IT!.
  While this is a must for beginning and intermediate players, even very advanced players could learn a thing or two from Jojo's instruction, and I would suggest that they at the very least they check it out on Netflix.  Jojo basically aims to exploit physics as much as possible in order to obtain impossibly fast hand speed.  This DVD does not cover coordination technique- it only covers hand/stick technique ...for three hours.  A lot of Moeller and Gladstone type stuff.  Jojo's instruction is very clear and somewhat humorous, and the video production is not distracting.  Considering the computer-generated visual aides, (I can't believe I'm saying this about a drum DVD) I would even say the video production is helpful.
  This DVD could have been formatted a little better if it had been split into ""comprehension"" and ""practice exercises"" sections.  That way the viewer could watch the comprehension sections a couple times, and then play through the practice exercises without having to skip through the talking each time.

On a separate note, I really REALLY wish Jojo would produce a video covering (or expand this video to include) his foot technique.  It's basically the same physics-based principals he uses for his stick technique, only applied to his feet in order to get mindblowing super-fast double-kicks.",1256342400,2,1453,5.0588235294117645
2883163,5,B000S6TNLI,"I have never seen someone who knew so much about the minor details of playing drums. This dvd has really forced me to consider many aspects of my playing without forcing me to ""forget everything"". I have watched it several times now and have learned things everytime. If you don't own this dvd, and you want to improve your drumming, don't hesitate to pick this one over most of the ""hey, look what I can do"" dvd's out there.",1254096000,,425,4.3924050632911396
2883164,5,B000S6TNLI,"What a tremedous DVD. My drum instructor uses the same methods covered by Jojo Mayer. It is most helpful to have a video and audio record of the technique and the basis for it.  It makes so much sense to make use of the limbs the way described here.  All involved body parts function together making for a very smooth, flowing, and musical presentation of drumming.  A most excellent production.",1245974400,,395,4.614285714285714
2883165,5,B000S6TNLI,"In over 27 years behind the drum kit, this is the video/resource I've missed all those years. Some of techniques taught I have already used. However, not like Jojo. I've used the finger bounce technique for years and it worked for various playing requirements. Jojo's explanation covered every aspect of the technique and allowed me to refine my version to address issues that kept me from achieving speed and control. The video inspired me to get it up to speed which I did over a few solid months of focused practice.

This video is strictly for ""how"" to play, not ""what"" to play. That said, you can think of it as the ""tools in the toolbox"". Once you have the set of tools, you can build something!

Truly, ALL the secrets are revealed! The Moeller technique, the push-pull technique (used by Buddy Rich and other legends), etc with variations and applications for each. What I really liked about the DVD is each technique implemented lots of slow motion playbacks, CGI imaging to really isolate key concepts, and other methods. This, to me, was ESSENTIAL to properly learn the techniques. Too many drum videos out there simply run through the material quickly with no chance to get up close or to view a technique in a ""motion study"" setting. This DVD truly stands out for that aspect.

Finally, Jojo discusses his philosophies for practicing, learning new techniques, and performance. This information alone has a value equal to the techniques demonstrated. My favorite was his assertion that he never practices, the ""performs"". Pure gold!

The only thing missing that would have been the icing on the cake would be some information about his bass drum technique. Jojo plays really fast sixteenth notes on the bass drum with one foot by implementing a variation of the ""push pull"" technique using leg and ankle motions. It would have been nice to see that in this learning mode. This technique is demonstrated on Youtube and other sites, but it would have been WONDERFUL in this DVD.

That aside, buy this DVD. Hands down, it's the best learning tool for beginning, intermediate, and advanced drummers out there.",1245369600,3,2117,4.853185595567867
2883166,5,B000S6TNLI,"Honestly, I don't understand how anyone could rate this DVD under 5 stars. It is that thorough, that helpful, and that good! Compare the DVD's price with the price of private drum lessons, and the DVD's price is more than worth it. The purpose of my review is to insist that this product is nothing less than 5 stars.

The only thing Jojo Mayer could have done better with this DVD, is offer a full refund to unsatisfied customers. That would help with buyer confidence. Buy it!",1242604800,,478,4.494252873563219
2883167,5,B000S6TNLI,"I might be on my own here, but I think there are some drummers like myself who, although we have been playing for years (20 years plus for me), have not had lessons or cannot afford them. Nevertheless, we are still hungry for information and inspiration. One can only listen to records for so long without wanting to see someone actually playing.
These type of instructional DVD's are shortcuts, but are the next best thing to lessons, I feel.

This DVD fulfils that educational need for me - I find I can go back to it every so often. Anything that shows drummers that they do not need to hurt themselves by playing too hard by showing that natural physics should be made to work for us is very welcome. I think that in itself is a secret weapon - it's also VERY obvious, but there must be a few drummers out there who think they've got to look like they are in pain whilst playing and confuse that with making an effort.

Hopefully this DVD shows them that they need to think about how they move and why some techniques may not be good for the arm, wrist or hand.

If an instrumentalist wishes to perform (and be paid to perform) well into their 60's or beyond, they will need good technique - that probably holds true for any instrument. What Jojo does on this DVD in a lighthearted but fully accurate manner is show that the modern drummer has quite a few options available - in the way of using different strokes and grips.

It is likely he will enlighten you to some extent, depending on how much you already know, of course.

I won't use all of the techniques he describes, but the DVD did (and continues to) show me that I need to be aware of how my hands move and whether they are hurting whilst I'm playing at a gig. If they are, then I change what I'm doing. I can't do that if I don't have options - this DVD equips you well.
It will depend on the style of music you like to play and you may find some of the ideas to be a bit like 'tricks', like the one-handed roll.

Those who like to play full out rock may see that Jojo can play in a jazzy way and may follow that interest - in that case, may I also recommend Steve Smith's DVD, 'Standing on the Shoulders of Giants'.",1234656000,6,2183,4.198090692124105

2883169,4,B000S6TNLI,"I am a novice drummer, but been playing other instruments on/off forever. I found his bottoms up review on how to hold the stick, how to strike the surface, how the various arm/wrist motions are to be done, very very useful. I take weekly lessons in which I don't have patience to do this stuff, so I bought this DVD so as to catch up on the basics on my own cheap time. I learned a ton just from side 1 of the DVD.... he teaches this stuff with nice slow-mo closeups so that a novice like me could actually replicate his moves and stroke sounds.

Jojo--- excellent job and you've done a great service for drummers everywhere. Not a cheap DVD, but worth it... I'd say this DVD is the same as about 10 one hour private lessons from someone of Jojo's calibre... do you think you could get that for $39? Nah.

2883174,5,B000S6TNLI,"Wow. WOW! I apologize but I'm still blown away by the content in this video. There has been a lot covered in other reviews so I'll just give you my experience with this video and how it's help me. I'll also restate the best aspects of this video.

I did my share of research before purchasing this video and just about everyone exclaimed how amazing it is. Well, look at the reviews here on Amazon. During the time of this review there are 48 reviews written and only a handful (5) are 4-star reviews, nothing lower. Everyone loves this video and for good reason. If you're looking to improve your hand technique (and who isn't) then this is the only video you will need to master.

I'm a bit of a late bloomer with the drums. I've always appreciated the drums very much but for some reason I grew up a bass player. Well I'm 27 now and it's about time to go ahead and hang up the bass. It's going to be impossible to cover 20 years worth of ground in the next few years, so instead I figured I would just become the best drummer I can become in the shortest amount of time possible. I noticed many drummers that have been playing for years that aren't very proficient have poor hand technique. I wanted to nip this one in the bud right away because I believe that will help me gain some time back. A lot of drummers focus on speed from the get-go and forget about technique and control - which in my opinion is much more important.

No amount of YouTube how-to videos can train you like Jojo can. I have learned much more during one viewing of this video then I've learned with all other YouTube videos I've watched combined. As stated in other reviews - Jojo not only has absolutely perfect technique, he also teaches these techniques very well.

Jojo is a great teacher. He comes across as a very down to earth, very professional and intelligent drummer. You can see his fluidity with every movement he makes, not just with the drums. Jojo guides you through each technique very thoroughly. He provides troubleshooting tips for the most common problems, I found these especially helpful. Jojo also does a great job of injecting little comedy bits throughout the video. The bit towards the end of the movie where he shows a hand clapping exercise is especially funny.

The most desired techniques are discussed, included the ever-so-sought-after Moeller technique. Actually the Moeller technique is discussed in great detail. You will also learn finger, wrist, forearm and shoulder techniques, the free stroke (or Gladstone method), French grip, German grip, Matched and Traditional grip and much more.

Jojo really showed me how to look at drums in a whole different light. I'm more pumped then ever!

One of the complaints I keep reading about is that he doesn't show a whole lot of him playing crazy beats behind the kit. Well, this is good and bad. It's bad because he's such a joy to watch, but it's good because that means you have 3 hours of good solid training content. I prefer the training because I can always check out YouTube and watch many Jojo videos.

Just get this. If you want to really go to the next level with your hand technique then you have no reason for not buying this. This is one of those videos I would pay hundreds of dollars for if I had to. I've stopped taking drum lessons because this video is elevating my skills much faster then my drum teacher ever could. Remember he makes it look so easy because it will become so easy, just keep practicing. Productive practice makes perfect.",1216771200,17,3516,4.5434439178515005

Being that it is not exactly like riding a bike (the fundamentals come back but overall I feel like a spaz), I decided to relearn everything the right way by getting some drum DVD's and books.  Of the several training items I purchased, this one is the best. JoJo is entertaining, extremely talented, and does an excellent job demonstrating what he is trying to teach you.  He doesn't zip through anything during the lessons.  Plus he has a good sense of humor and is easy to listen to. This is one great instructional DVD and highly recommended.

Jojo Mayer breaks steps down into the simplest forms and shows you clear explanations of every technique.  The video work is awesome on this instructional video and just enhances the excellent materal within.

2883179,5,B000S6TNLI,"JoJo Mayer takes the time to explain concepts properly and thoroughly with multiple demonstrations.  This is invaluable to me since I don't automagically understand a concept just by having it demonstrated to me.  All of the mechanics of the free stroke, moeller, and other techniques are broken down in detail with even some slow motion capture of the demonstrations.

Beginners should still have a reliable teacher who knows these techniques to correct any minor mistakes.  Moeller technique, especially, can be detrimental if not practiced properly and can create more strain instead of relieving it.  Check to see if your teacher has studied with any players who focus on hand technique (Joe Morello, Jim Chapin, Dom Famularo, Danny Gottlieb, etc.)

The only point in the video that I did not agree with was using the middle finger and thumb as the fulcrum for german grip as opposed to the index and thumb.  It's a personal preference, but I have never felt comfortable playing that way.  If the grip is used improperly, that can be another source of strain and impede your development as a player.",1208736000,3,1103,4.956521739130435

The technical production is superb and the animations really bring out the lessons clearly. If you find you are sore, experience pain, break sticks, drum heads or any of the many aliments that plague drummers then you need to have this video.

Jojo's playing is also great. The streetbeats section is my favorite.

The longer solo's are good too, but don't do much for me. I mean, I understand that the point is, ""hey, look how I use my technique on the kit."" But I just found them a little boring. I was also hoping that he would do more of his drum and bass thing that he is so good at.

Jojo's DVD is such an extraordinary model of clarity, simplicity, and painstaking detail that I really feel there is nothing left to explain. It's all right there. Now if I can't do a one-handed roll at buzz-roll speed, it's only because I haven't practiced it enough, not because I don't know how. I guess I'll just have to practice more--much more.

It uses multiple camera angles, animation, slow-motion, repetition at various speeds, and, perhaps most useful from my point of view, he demonstrates a technique using all those tools, then shows you the same technique with no stick in his hand, so you can clearly see the finger, hand, and wrist motions and all the muscle contractions. If surgeons had an instructional video like this, there would never be another malpractice suit.",1198108800,8,1172,4.717073170731707

These details are not only shown, but explained precisely and concisely.  You also get to seem them demonstrated by a master.  If I could recommend only one instructional DVD (and there are many excellent choices), this would be the one.  I consider it a must have for any beginning drummer, regardless of playing style.  I rate very few products with 5 stars, but this one clearly earned it.",1195430400,16,551,4.747368421052632

Ever notice how great drummers' hands just flow effortlessly? It's because they know the sweet spot on a drumstick, how the hands, fingers and wrist work, how to allow the stick to rebound off the drumhead (as opposed to digging it into the head), etc.

As an added bonus, he does a couple of solo demonstrations that completely kicks MAJOR A$$. He is definitely one of my favorite drummers of all time.",1194998400,9,554,4.711340206185567

2883201,5,B000S6TNLI,"Drummers: If you want to learn some skills that will make your playing faster, and less strenuous than ever before, then check this DVD out!

I've been drumming now for about 4-5 years, and had little to no training/lessons. I had to learn everything I know pretty much by guessing, and trial and error methods... Trust me, it's been quite an expensive, and sometimes frustrating ride..... During that time, I've broken a lot of sticks and heads, and now I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING WRONG THE WHOLE TIME!!! I've only been practicing the skills and tips explained on this DVD for about 5 days now, and have already noticed drastic improvement in my playing speed and endurance... I can already tell that my current set of sticks and heads will last me at least twice as long as they ever have!!!

Jojo's scientific approach to drumming saves your energy, and helps prevent strain on muscle groups and joints. If you're like me, and frequently break heads/sticks, or your wrists/fingers/any other part of your upper body hurt from drumming, do yourself a favor, and buy this DVD NOW!!!

2883204,5,B000S6TNLI,"I've viewed many drum instructional videos during my 25 yrs of playing, but I must say, this DVD by JoJo Mayer is by far the most comprehensive and insightful presentation on hand technique I've seen.  The material is presented in an easy-to-understand format, is well produced with great graphics and camera angles, and JoJo shares his insights with a wonderful, engaging sense of humor.  What makes this unlike any other I've seen is that his approach is based on the physics of how the human body moves most naturally, with the goal being maximum effect with minimum effort.

He covers the basic grips, the fulcrum, finger exercises, the ""free stroke"", the Moeller Stroke, the ""push-pull"" technique,  and sooooo much more.  Illustrations of JoJo's eye-popping hand technique indicate what's truly do-able & possible if one puts in concerted effort at the drums.  The video contains no patterns or `licks', rudimental exercises, independence exercises or foot technique  - there are tons of other DVDs and books for that.  JoJo focuses strictly on hand technique.

This DVD has sent me scurrying to the practice room, and has reignited my quest to gain greater control of my hands, with the ultimate goal of being able to play whatever I hear in my head.  Highly recommended!",1189728000,5,1277,5.009478672985782

It leaves no ""mysteries"" (so to speak) about many techniques and concepts that were previously covered ambiguously in other videos or by other drummers. If you want amazing hands, this is it. Period. It has benefited me immensely. I recommend it to any player, beginner to pro.
