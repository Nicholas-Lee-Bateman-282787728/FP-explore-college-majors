6403554,2,B00K6J7SUU,"I bought the Blu ray for the unedited version of this film entitled The North Star... what a wierd film, before we knew Stallin was as bad as or worse than Hitler. very strange film - almost feels like alternate reality.... ultimately not enjoyable for me - I just felt it was too contrary to what I grew up knowing... odd all around. I will watch Armored Attack at some later point  - perhaps the excised content and new edit help the film but until then this is intersting and of value from a hiostoricalperspective - both film and actual history... people tend to forget that without the Russians we may not have won the European conflict.... and the Germany was fascist not communist - we grew to hate the commies in the  aftermath of WW2...",1408233600,3,745,4.470588235294118
6403555,5,B00K6J7SUU,"What a joy it is to see this multi Oscar-nominated film finally presented in a video format that compliments its visual style and beauty rather than works against it.  Prior public domain offerings were torturous to watch.  And to have both the original release (""The North Star"") as well as the repurposed rerelease, with heavy editing to change the focus and intent of the film -- well, that's almost too much to hope for.  Also included is the original radio broadcast of the story.  In all, I could not have asked for more.  Thoroughly delighted! (Although captioning for the hearing impaired would be nice -- com'on Olive Films.)",1406937600,19,634,4.833333333333333
6403556,5,B00K6J7SUU,"Great WWII propaganda film!  All star cast with hilarious opening scene of villagers of the Ukraine having dancing feast day.  These were the people the Russians were starving to death so harshly that the Germans got a division of Ukraine volunteers to fight the soviets!  The action sequences are great and the young leads, an older Jane Withers (former child star) and Farley Granger do good service as patriotic anti-Nazis.  Great film and Blue Ray has to do a better job of it than the previous release which was barely watchable.  The shortened version ""Armored Attack"" has all the pro-Soviet emphasis cut out.",1405900800,11,615,4.932038834951456

6403558,5,B00K6J7SUU,"This single disc classic World War 2 movie on Blu-Ray, arrived on time and intact, with no damage to either the disc or the case, which the disc came in. Picture sound and features playback is superb. A stirriing movie, full of love, determination, pain and suffering revolving around the inhabitants of a Russian farming community on the Russian/Polish border, during the Germans opening invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. With stirring performances by Anne Baxter and Dana Andrews and shown in its original black and white 4 x 3 picture release and not widescreen, including both the original fully restored version, with an additional 30 minutes put back into the film and its edited 1957 version. I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray movie to anyone who purchases it online from amazon.com.",1436054400,3,803,5.0
6403559,5,B00K6J7SUU,"This film (The North Star) got a seriously bad rap.  No way it's near ""Mission to Moscow"" levels of propaganda.  If we were never told this took place in the Ukraine, it could be any other place in Eastern Europe caught in the wake of the Nazi march eastward.  The USSR element of the story is essentially a non-issue aside from brief mentions of the Russian Army.

In a nutshell, ""somewhere in Eastern Europe,"" a small village is having a festival while the war seems very far away.  All of a sudden, the German blitz hits the village with bombs with troops soon to follow.  The villagers start to panic until the mayor rallies them together into a sort of guerilla fighting force to help defend their homeland.

This is such a universally accessible plot that Lewis Milestone essentially told the same story again set in Norway in the film ""Edge of Darkness"" starring Errol Flynn where Norwegian peasants rise up against the German invader in a guerilla-like fashion.  You can find dozens of films with similar plots about locals fighting against a Nazi or Japanese invasion.  There's very little politics in this movie, just humble innocents defending their homes from a ruthless invader.  The presence of the Russian army itself is rather minute, and no one sings the Soviet national anthem or that sort of thing.

What sets this film apart is some great special effects for its era.  This was shot entirely on a sound stage, yet the bombing and aerial sequences use impressive analog effects and the action has a necessary visceral look to it.  Easily some of the best in Hollywood circa 1943, and years before copious use of stock footage became the norm.

The one oddball thing about it was the musical elements in the first 30 minutes.  Fans of Hollywood musicals would no doubt appreciate it, but considering there are no musical numbers (not even somber ones) once the combat starts it feels a bit out of place.  Though personally, I believe that was the artistic intent, the lampshade how idyllic peacetime was to the grip realities of being caught on the battlefront of wartime

The propaganda element sets because this was made during the height of WWII, so the Allies were always good and the Axis was always bad.  Very rarely was there any blurring the line between the two.  In this case we have an extreme example of Nazi evilness in which they not only loot from the village, but steal their children in order to use them as walking blood banks.  I have doubts that even the Nazis used such a method in an organized fashion, in addition to how such a practice clash with the Nazi of racial superiority and the keeping the Aryan bloodline pure.

Though, really, does anyone expect that Hollywood would even be allowed to criticize the USSR after its invasion by the Nazis up until the end of the war?  It was keeping the entire Eastern front in check, and Washington no doubt felt it was too valuable an ally at the time to risk offending.  As such, the War Department's job was to assure the public that every ally, even the USSR, was ""fighting the good fight.""  Sure, the free press razzed the pro-Ruskie stuff at the time, but that was generally focused on keeping the foreign communist element in check.

It's also important to note that the USSR wasn't really perceived as ""evil"" in those days and the more horrific facts such as gulags and mass starvation were largely unknown to the general public due to the highly secretive nature of how the USSR operated.  Throughout the 30s, Soviet relations with the USA were warmer than most other European nations.  To the general public, the USSR was nothing but a curio of a nation, the result of a flawed political experiment but more comical than fearsome (especially compared to Fascist Europe).  Hitler went so far as to believe the USSR was weak enough to be conquered in a matter of months.  The only men that feared the USSR in those days were the big businessmen who bucked against ""bolshevik"" unionizing and organized laborers becoming devotedly Marxist.

Obviously, the twilight years of WWII changed this perception in a major way.  This films is an invaluable time capsule of a different, more innocent viewpoint.  And is a pretty fun movie to boot.",1433548800,5,4228,4.702445652173913

6403564,5,B00K6J7SUU,"Those are the final words in Armored Attack!"".

This is interesting considering the significant percentage of discretionary income Americans send to a Communist country.  That communist country then takes your money and builds nuclear weapons with your zip code on it.

This is not your typical war movie.  The photography is shot in a more artful form.  Also, the storyline revolves around the civilian tragedies created by German and Russian dictators.

One truly must take pity on the civilians of Eastern Europe who know war all too well.

Exquisite photography and excellent acting.  Picture and sound were also excellent.  This movie belongs in your DVD/Blu-ray collection.",1416096000,7,679,5.330188679245283

8656285,5,B00K6J7SUU,"The original movie, North Star, was made when the Soviet Union was our ally during WWII.  It is filled with all sorts of pro-Soviet and anti-Nazi propaganda.  The setting is a quiet rural village invaded by the Nazis, the women and children are tortured and killed, and the men form a resistance to fight back.  Use the same setting in a quiet town in Iowa and the meaning becomes clear.  Armored Attack is the movie North Star reedited to remove any pro-Soviet propaganda and have the people fighting an invading army.  It was re-released after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956.  Powerful movie.",1494806400,,602,4.740384615384615
