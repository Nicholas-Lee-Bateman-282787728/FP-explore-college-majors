8180050,1,B000NOKF80,"Again - old hippies sitting around and ""discussing"" Mott The Hoople.  Save your money, folks, it's too hard to come by right now.  Listening to someone ""discuss"" Mott The Hopple, SUPURB band that they were, is like looking at a Polaroid of the Mona Lisa.",1254700800,4,254,4.622222222222222
8180051,2,B000NOKF80,"I generally find these ""unauthorized"" DVD's about bands to be pretty weak affairs, heavy on talk from journalists and ""insiders"" and lacking any real musical substance or actual film footage of the artists in question. This DVD release on Mott The Hoople is no exception to that rule and pretty much what I expected. There is very little actual film footage of the band and what songs you do see performed are incomplete. With that said however there is really nothing else available on DVD of Mott The Hoople, so I ordered it anyway realizing it would likely not be particularly great. Probably the best part of the entire disk is Morgan Fisher's silent home movies that he took of his bandmates while on tour. The boys are seen climbing (and literally falling) out of cars and generally larking about having fun. He does a voice commentary while the film plays and it is this segment that is actually the most interesting and enlightening part of the entire DVD.",1200268800,8,964,4.710059171597633
8180052,3,B000NOKF80,"Being a serious Mott the Hoople fan for many years, I very much looked forward to this DVD. It has taken far too long for a history of this band to be made for posterity. I have to say though, I was slightly disappointed. The delivery is rather dry. There is little in the way of band interviews [either from the past, or recently] and not much of their music either. The DVD relies heavily on the commentary of a number of people; Mick Jones [The Clash], a few music journalists/critics, and studio engineer Mick Glossip, as well as Kris Needs who ran the Mott fan club. There are a lot of facts, and many opinions, but there is a lack of color and depth to the production. On the plus side, there is an emphasis put on the bands early years [Island Records]. Since many casual fans of Mott believe the bands first album was All the Young Dudes, it is good that this DVD sets the record straight. Mott did have a very nice career before All the Young Dudes! And maybe some people will be inspired to go out and purchase some of those recordings. It will be worth it! One thing I found conspicuously absent from the DVD was any controversial statements about anything having to do with the departure of various band members, or the bands final demise. As Mott fans know, there was much rancor at different times during the bands existence, and there has been some hard feelings. But regardless of this DVDs shortcomings, it is a must buy for any Mott fan.",1187049600,18,1455,4.392592592592592
