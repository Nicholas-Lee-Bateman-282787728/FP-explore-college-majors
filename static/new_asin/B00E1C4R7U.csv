8599958,5,B00E1C4R7U,"All three ballets are wonderfully done with great dancing, good audio sounds and good visual presentation. These have the quality of audio/visual that I had hoped for. Highly recommended for your ballet collection.",1421366400,3,214,5.515151515151516
8599959,3,B00E1C4R7U,"I don't know if I can recommend this entire package. The Sleeping Beauty, featuring Alina Cojocaru, is probably the only one that is a truly top-notch performance. Although both Swan Lake and Nutcracker have amazing qualities to them, I feel like there are better options out there for both in the DVD world.

For example, I feel like Royal Ballet's Nutcracker does not match up very well with the SF Ballet production.

Unless you know for a fact that you actually love ALL three of the productions in this package, I think you are better off just getting DVDs for each of these ballets separately, so you can get the productions you really love.

The DVD extras are very weak, and I don't feel they add very much to the package's value.",1416441600,10,738,4.575757575757576
8599960,5,B00E1C4R7U,"This is a real ""Oh my gosh!"" selection.  I think these are the best productions and performances of Sleeping Beauty and Swan Lake that I've ever seen - and I think I own almost every one that's out on DVD.  They have stayed very close to the classic choreography, which I particularly appreciate.  No ungainly surprises or favorite sections missing or changed.  A really great collection to have in your library. You'll go back to them again and again.",1385683200,17,452,4.6835443037974684
