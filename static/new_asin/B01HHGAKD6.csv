7787418,5,B01HHGAKD6,"If youve read my other reviews of DVDs on Amazon, you will know that I hate spoilers  especially when it comes to mystery series, which I love. Way too many reviewers spoil the enjoyment by providing way too much info after THEY, themselves have enjoyed being surprised. You won't find those in my reviews. At least I try.

The DVD will not be released until September 2t, 2016 . I was provided with an advance screener in exchange for an objective review.
This mystery is not a repeating series  at least its not planned to be. It is, however, divided into 8 episodes which run from 42 to 55 minutes each. It was made for French/Belgian  TV where the need to fill 20 minutes of commercials in each hour is not required. It is one long police case of the search for a pretty teenage girl who goes missing in a small town in France. Its the kind of story where EVERY character has something to hide. No Im not going to even tell you of the police (led by a new male detective and his female partner) find the girl. Even that info would affect how you experience the story.

If youve seen the British series, Broadchurch (which has been released in 2 seasons), you have an idea of the TYPE of story this is. I actually think its better. It is, however, in French but has easy to read English subtitles. The story moves slowly but for the better. There is a scene in Episode 5 where the characters are emotional but they don't reveal the emotion in words, just in body language, breathing and the looks on their faces.
None of the actors were folks Ive seen before and this made it even better.

The DVD has just one bonus feature: A Photo Gallery (a bonus I never quite understand why its there).

There is ONCE occurance of an expletive (the ""S"" word) in Frenbch and one brief (30 second) scene with a female topless and a shot of a male's naked ""butt"". There are grapgic violent images too.

So thats all Im telling you about the show. As I said, if you like the other multi-episode mysteries from Acorn or on PBS Mystery, I think youll enjoy this one. I certainly did!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7787419,5,B01HHGAKD6,"Top notch show, fr excellent writing, to stellar cast/acting. The anguish the parents feel once they realized their daughter is missing, is palpable. As a childfree by choicer, i can only imagine how a parent would feel, and  this portrayal was gut wrenching to watch.  The only thing i felt that could have been improved is that it took a tad to long to get to the conclusion, since i had long figured it out.  This is good stuff, on par with another of my french favorites, Spiral",1490572800,,482,4.454545454545454
7787420,5,B01HHGAKD6,"This is a great story even though it is in French. It does have English subtitles so once you get used to that it is easy to follow. You don't know who the villain is until the very end but there are many ""red herrings"" along the way. Worth a look.",1484092800,2,248,3.8823529411764706

7787426,5,B01HHGAKD6,"Completely engrossing and worth a ""binge watch"". It is true that the reviewer said that you forget about the French language and read the subtitles because it is so entertaining. Everyone is suspect. Although we are smack in the Midwest, our entertainment preferences are Acorn and BBC productions. This is comparable to Broadchurch and better than The Missing. Be prepared to be hooked and let the chores go by the wayside.",1482105600,9,424,4.985915492957746

7787429,5,B01HHGAKD6,If you liked Broadchurch (and you should) you will like this.  Very well acted with many twists and turns (perhaps one or two too many).  A good look at what a disappearance does to a family and friends.,1479859200,4,203,4.315789473684211
7787430,5,B01HHGAKD6,"Truly a stunning mystery. There were times when the video seemed to go too far into the character, but at the end it all worked out, Each character is developed very well and the story-line carries us to some unusual suspects.",1478822400,7,226,4.536585365853658

7787434,5,B01HHGAKD6,"wonderfully suspenseful!
English sub titles and after awhile , I didn't notice no English language.
Story is not convoluted , but the guilt for the crime goes from one to another cast member.
Loved the story plot and acting. Once I started , I binged all day on the entire DVD
Recommended for appropriate audienceI loved it !",1476921600,7,325,4.620689655172414
7787435,1,B01HHGAKD6,"In the product description, the language of this show is listed as ""English"". It is, however, in French with English subtitles; completely misleading, incorrect and deceitful. I'll be sending this back.",1476489600,2,202,5.548387096774194
7787436,5,B01HHGAKD6,"The Disappearance. This intense, universally acclaimed  French television answer to Broadchurch, a psychological crime drama, introduces us to the Morels, a three offspring, seemingly typical, although unusually handsome family.  Their ethereally beautiful 17-year old daughter Lea (Camille Razat) does not return home after a late night out celebrating her birthday. The Morels, residents of the Rhone River-hugging red-roofed city of Lyon, are unexpectedly thrown into their worst nightmare. (Although, let me say here, Ive known of no typical family that would allow a schoolgirl, never mind its being her birthday, and her going out with her brother, to stay out until 3 A.M. on a school night!) However.  Mother Florence (Alix Poisson, THE RETURNED) tries to remain strong for her other children, hopeful that her daughter will return home safely, while father Julien (Pierre Franois Martin-Laval) begins an investigation of his own. The policeled by Commander Bertrand Molina (Franois-Xavier Demaison) and his lieutenant, Camille Guerin (Alice Pol)desperately search to find the missing teen; shocking truths soon begin to leak out, revealing secrets hidden by L&eacute;a and those closest to her.

The French language series with English subtitles was made for French/Belgian TV; it was a huge ratings hit when it premiered in France.  It recently debuted in the United Kingdom in June 2016 on BBC Four, is based on the award-winning Spanish series DESAPARECIDA. And, by the way, the French title, DISPARU, means DISAPPEARED, not the more passive THE DISAPPEARANCE.

The acting was universally excellent, even more convincing to those in this house because we both believe weve never seen any of these actors before, not even in the odd French movie that we catch. The seldom seen on screen city of Lyon looked lovely, bathed in its river, with leafy Tte-dOr, a gigantic park, home to a huge lake, in which park a lot of the action occurs.  The plot, although familiar in its basic outlines, is gripping, tight, taut. Even though the series comes to us in eight episodes, might be considered slow by American TV standards.  But  the noir-outlook  police procedural is exhaustively suspenseful to the  end, full of twists and turns, new information, red herrings, false leads.  It grew in power, kept us glued to the screen, binge-watching as quick as  the hardware, human and otherwise, would allow.

The box set, which I received as an advance screener for objective review, consists of eight episodes, 42 to 55 minutes in length.  The production runs approximately 417 minutes, has subtitles; one bonus, a photo gallery.  And beware, sensitive souls, it contains coarse language, violence, sexual situations, nudity: not for family viewing. And by the way, in this house, we didn't find the subtitles difficult; then again, were both getting a little hard of hearing and thus always use any available subtitles. We have rarely seen such an addictive production,  wouldnt have missed it for the world.",1476489600,12,3009,5.248434237995824
7787437,5,B01HHGAKD6,"Really compelling, a little soap-operish thriller that doesn;t fail.  A solid Scandi-style noir from France.",1475193600,,108,6.2

8765484,3,B01HHGAKD6,"The plot keeps my interest and scenes are well set.  My problem is the emotional overplay of the characters, constantly lying and blowing up. I have had extreme events in my family and never ever seeing anyone behave this way. Id say it is the French, except I see this over emoting in brit and American shows as well. Id never give this an award, as I think it received, unless you have only mediocre shows to compare this to.",1517702400,,427,4.3375
8765485,5,B01HHGAKD6,Like many serial dramas there are many cliffhangers at the end of episodes. It has subtitles and I speak a bit of French but I was surprised how much I enjoyed this production and how the acting enhanced the captions . I would certainly buy another series.,1515024000,,256,4.468085106382978

8765487,5,B01HHGAKD6,Excellent series and totally bingeworthy.  The writing and acting are both well done and this plot keeps you interested tot he very end.
