8303128,4,B001FZ998I,"The story unfolds nicely, if you have some knowledge about the Chinese Civil war, which is quite complex, and staggering in it's proportions, if you consider, that almost a Billion people where affected by it. This movie just covers a ""little"" episode of the war.
One of the many hundred that where fought between the National vs the Red Army. The movie (Black & White) shows it's age, if you compare it with ""The Assembly"". Nevertheless thousands of soldiers (from the Red Army), used as extras, stage some spectacular battle scenes, make your CGI spoiled experience forget. The acting is surprisingly deep, it stands up nicely to Hollywood and European contemporary productions.",1365724800,5,680,5.080357142857143
