8152703,5,B000JRPGGC,"Under the most gelid perspective, this project literally was overlooked by unexplainable reasons. As a matter of fact and after having watched the last Sunday I guess this brilliant script was the seminal seed  for Cinema Paradiso; and deals with the epic efforts of a lover of cinema for trying to seduce, involve and entangle a small Italian town along three decades. During the first two, everything seems to be right, but with the early eighties the entertainment's world experiences a sudden change. The great movies are projected in your TV; so apparently you don't have the necessity to displace from your home to the cinema hall; and so the decreasing audiences will lead to dive in multiple debts to his owner with the expected decision to give up and close it forever.

Splendor deals with a bitter reality. The magic of cinema is dying. The great halls are simply vanishing; the VHS by then and DVD now are if I may overlapping and lessening progressively, the number of people who use to weatch movies. During thirty years, the audiences used to go with relative frequency to Splendor theatre, managed by Marcelo Mastroianni, his couple and the charismatic friend, the unforgettable Massimo Troisi who really steals the show with his natural acting.

The great movies are really the big stars; before your eyes Metropolis. Z, Amarcord and It's a wonderful life will make their brief but forceful appearances that will move you. Some stylistic pirouettes here and there, ornamented by sensual photos of the Great goddesses of the cinema.

A refreshing and potent film that will invite you to think and rethink about this pitiful but unavoidable issue.",1199750400,,1662,4.967625899280575
