8154431,5,B000K4WT50,"A masterpiece for those that value uniqueness and deft use of minimalist symbolism. This is enigmatic, somber material to be sure... mysterious. It doesn't offer english subtitles but you can find the dialogue posted on the net, it doesn't matter too much since it's apparently undefined in it's ultimate meaning. The creator Oshii even states, or claims he doesn't even know the meaning of this strange and enchanting visual, musical tone poem. I've read that he had a falling out from Christianity, so I take this as an anti-Zionist work, which I wholeheartedly embrace since I myself have left belief in most religions behind me long ago. To me the symbolism if obviously anti-Zionist as the all seeing eye descends and the crusader steps forth into view on the black and white checkered/Satanic landing pad. The subversive Zionist force sets forth to destroy and enslave another civilization unto it's ruination.",1489276800,,916,5.113333333333333
8154432,4,B000K4WT50,"I stumbled upon this movie thanks to TV Tropes, and it struck me as odd but worthy of checking out.  I've enjoyed quite a bit of anime, from more mainstream releases like ""Fairy Tail"" and ""One Piece"" to slightly more obscure shows like ""Brave Police J-Decker"" and ""Polar Bear Cafe,"" but something like ""Angel's Egg"" looked like a true oddity.  When I saw it being described with such terms as ""mind-screw"" and ""incomprehensible,"" my curiosity was piqued -- after all, just how confusing and weird could it be?  I ended up tracking down and watching a copy... and yes, it's safe to say that this is one of the strangest animated films I have ever seen.  And yet that's not a bad thing, and this film will haunt me for a long time to come.

""Angel's Egg"" is set in a dark, almost gothic-looking city that, for all intents and purposes, looks nearly abandoned.  Walking the streets of this city is a young girl who compulsively fills bottles with water and arranges them around the city... and also carries around the titular egg, which she seems to guard with her life.  She encounters a mysterious, soldier-like man who carries a cross-shaped weapon... and who follows her, either out of curiosity or some sort of pre-determined mission.  At first she's scared of him and tries to flee, but as he tells her stories about how the world came to be in its present state and protects her from a gang of ghostly fishermen, she slowly grows to trust him... a trust that could have devastating consequences.

The story sounds relatively straightforward... yet there's so much more going on here than that synopsis would suggest.  There's a bizarre spaceship covered in statues and wailing organ pipes... giant shadowy fish that float through the city and are hunted by fishermen who are either ghosts or living statues... the fossilized bones of massive animals littering the empty city... talk of angels and doves and a strange black tree draining the life out of the land... and most tellingly of all, a retelling of the story of Noah's Ark, but with a radically altered ending, telling of a world where God forsook the Ark and the flood waters never receded, leaving Noah and his passengers stranded amid an endless sea waiting for a dove that never returned.  It's never quite clear exactly what's happening, even though it's strongly implied that this city is build upon the empty hull of the forsaken Ark... and thus, it's left up to the viewer to interpret exactly what's happening.

This isn't precisely a horror movie, and I doubt it was created with the intent to scare people outright.  But it's certainly haunting and unsettling, with a dark and abandoned city, an eerie soundtrack of dread-inducing drones and haunting choral numbers, and a minimalist cast and script.  There's very little dialogue, which means the bleak but strangely beautiful visuals carry much of the story.  The artwork does have some iffy moments -- facial features can shift at odd moments, and both the girl and the man look either tired or bored throughout the entire film (though the ""tired"" look could be intentional on the part of the animators) -- but overall it's startlingly lovely, and almost reminiscent of some of the cult-classic animated films of the '80s, such as ""The Last Unicorn"" and Rankin-Bass's ""The Hobbit.""

And as stated before, while this movie can be baffling to watch -- especially for most Western viewers who expect the plot to be spelled out explicitly for them -- it can also be a rewarding experience as well.  There are many different ways to analyze and interpret this film, from an allegorical standpoint or from a straightforward story standpoint.  And no one interpretation seems to be entirely wrong.

I can't say this is my favorite anime film of all time, but it's certainly a memorable one, and it will haunt and stick with me for a long time to come.  I highly recommend it for anime and animation fans who want a more cerebral viewing experience and don't mind a somewhat confusing ride.  And if you're a fan of the works of Mamoru Oshii (who would go on to direct popular favorites like ""Ghost in the Shell,"" ""Patlabor,"" and ""The Sky Crawlers""), then this early work of his is worth checking out.",1486512000,,4218,4.7585733882030175

8154436,5,B000K4WT50,"Angel's Egg or Tenshi No Tamago is 1980's anime drawn in a style you would expect of that period. The story is of a little girl wandering around what appears to be a post-apocalyptic landscape, collecting jars of water for unknown purposes. In her care is a single giant egg about the size of a watermelon that she lovingly protects. She meets a strange man who is also wandering the landscape, but the difference is he seems to have a purpose determined by something higher up, opposite the girl who has given herself a purpose. The imagery and symbolism is enough to please anyone who likes cerebral and philosophical content. I liked it very much and wish the price wasn't so high, so that I could own a copy (I had borrowed it from a friend). Another way to describe it is, imagine a world after the great Biblical flood, if God had decided to leave it that way and not start over. An omnipresent gloomy atmosphere creates a dramatic background for every scene.",1410048000,14,965,4.551724137931035
