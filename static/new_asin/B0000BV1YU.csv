I've now got three more young children.. but the funny thing is, my 15 year old daughter is the one who wanted to buy it!  It's such a cute and sweet movie.",1440374400,,316,4.064516129032258

The true meaning of a penguins life comes through in the exhilarating musical score. It is a suspenseful story in which true friendship and love pull friends of all different sizes together to create one happy production.  We recommend this film to all families out there and hope they will enjoy it as much as we did and revisit Scamper and friends over and over again.",1087948800,2,513,4.741573033707865
