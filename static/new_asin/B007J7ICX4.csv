8518280,2,B007J7ICX4,"Poorly filmed and poorly told, this movie was frustratingly bad. It's a shame too, because the basic premise is compelling and the lead actress is quite good. Unfortunately the director was more interested in giving the film an ""edgy"" and ""contemporary"" style --- failing miserably, as the style sucked --- than in telling a good story ( developing the characters, developing the relationship between the boy and girl, building tension, etc.)",1377216000,2,442,5.23943661971831
8518281,1,B007J7ICX4,"this is a low cheap budget movie, terrible, horrible, bad quality no argument, no FX, old dudes in their 24 show like kids...bad start...too much bla bla kind of retard...yes don't waste of time in this movie stay away bad movie..",1370908800,,230,4.634146341463414
8518282,3,B007J7ICX4,"At a nice private High School rich kids are over indulgent. Darren (Oliver Ackland) is a computer robot junkie who lives in the shadow of his cooler step brother Zack (Alex Russell) who thinks very highly of himself. Xandrie (Adelaide Clemens) is a cutie who is ""crushing on Darren."" She attends a party filled with alcohol and drugs in hopes of spending some time with Darren. She passes out and spends time with everyone but Darren as our tale of innocent love becomes a tale of vengeance.

The film has some good scenes and a good ending. The characters didn't hook you as we got to know the bad guys better than the good guys. Darren was poorly written. The dialouge could have been better and the wanna-be relationship between our two main heroes is shown as a fleeting flashback and isn't well developed. It is drama/ thriller that could have been scripted better.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, male nudity. Deals with drugs and rape.",1366934400,,935,4.695121951219512
8518283,5,B007J7ICX4,Was a great flick tying together a lot of current themes and casting some very striking talent. I highly recommend.,1363824000,3,115,4.8
8518284,3,B007J7ICX4,"I saw this Australian film at a film festival and liked it enough to purchase a German import for home viewing.  I was expecting the dialogue to be in English with German sub-titles or in German with English sub-titles.  It had been dubbed into German with no subtitles.  So unless you understand German really well, you don't want this.
  I liked the actual film when I saw it - about rich high school kids who horribly abuse a girl in their throw-away society.  Not especially original or well written, but worth a view.",1356134400,3,522,4.559139784946237
