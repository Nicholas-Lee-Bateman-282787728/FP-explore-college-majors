7576603,5,B019NB5EVG,"A well acted, gripping story about the uncovering of the Catholic Church abuses in Boston. The cast is wonderful, all the performances are strong, and it grabs you quickly and keeps you into the story all the way through. One of the best journalism movies out there and recommended.",1532476800,,282,4.775510204081633
7576604,5,B019NB5EVG,"This is an important film for everyone to watch, but especially Catholics.  It is a shame to think that people would turn a blind eye to what is likely still going on behind closed doors.  Bravo to the Boston Globe for breaking this story.  Excellent acting and an outstanding film.",1531958400,,282,4.6

7576624,5,B019NB5EVG,"Everything about this movie is on point.  As a child who lived in Boston, it is more accurate than many would like to admit.  Catholicism should never outweigh the welfare of a child or the teachings of it's church.  The unfortunate yet extremely accurate telling of the abuses of the church in this movie are on point!  The intensity, the truth, the acting, the emotions & the storyline all make up the audacity to go against a system seemingly designed to hides it's most grotesque secrets against it's moth faithful followers.  #metoo  Expose them all!!",1525824000,,556,4.8
7576625,5,B019NB5EVG,"Spotlight is a riveting true story investigation that uncovered a decades-long scandal that rocks the Catholic Archdioceses.

A team of Boston Globe reporters ""Spotlight"", investigate and follow leads that point directly to Boston's highest levels of religious, legal and government establishments.

A magnificent team of actors portrayed a powerful performance in bringing justice to this unforgiving crime of child abuse.
These crimes were committed by some of the most trusting Catholic Priests, Bishops, Cardinals, etc involved in this massive cover-up.

Unfortunately there is still a huge presence of this matter continuing today around the globe.
One such place actively under investigation is in Buffalo, NY where the number of accused priests has surpassed 60.

I don't rate many 5 stars because I don't ""love"" things but this movie deserves recognition for it's spectacular outcome.",1525824000,2,892,5.634328358208955
7576626,5,B019NB5EVG,"What I love most about this film is the accuracy.  The filmmakers didn't 'Hollywoodize' the team effort to show a noble hero doing all the work.  It was real.  Real people work in teams to get things done.  Real teams have to work for long periods of time to get things done. Real people make mistakes, but if they keep at it, they can do something very important.  In this case, what they got done was exposing a corrupt systems damaging thousands of kids' lives.

Thank you Spotlight Team and thank you filmmakers for not messing with their story.",1525564800,,549,4.494949494949495
7576627,5,B019NB5EVG,"One of the best movies Ive seen in a VERY long time. I watched it 6+ times when it was free on Prime, and I liked it so much I finally bought the digital download.
Not only is it well written, well cast, and superbly acted, its a DISGUSTINGLY true story of how a team of journalists outed the decades long, ongoing molestation of vulnerable children by the Catholic clergy in Boston (and later worldwide) AND the knowledge of these acts and the covering up of them by Cardinals, Bishops, and ultimately the Vatican itself. How these criminals have been allowed to continue their abominable behavior - LITERALLY with the blessings of the Vatican, which means the Pope himself - is one of the most scathing indictments of organized religion one can imagine. The unapologetic stance of the Church in regard to this wretched saga of holy men gives an entire new meaning to the word hypocrisy. Its a MUST SEE film for those who care about vulnerable children and the evils of organized religion.",1525564800,,990,4.662857142857143
7576628,5,B019NB5EVG,A riveting film that tells the story no one would ever have suspected.  A brave Boston newspaper took on the political might of the Vatican & fired the proverbial shot heard round the world.  A superbly acted & wrenchingly precise portrayal of the events leading up to Cardinal Bernard Law's flight to Rome to escape prosecution.,1525219200,,329,4.857142857142857

unlike with ""non-digital"" items, i can find no way to ""return the time"" or raise an issue about the order, in order to communicate this problem. I chose longer shipping times 2-3 times in order to use the credits for digital media.

7576647,4,B019NB5EVG,I watched this movie not knowing what to expect. I how ever know now what to expect out of adults that know about theses things and do nothing if i had the power i would jail every one of theses so called priest. Moreover its sickening that people give this king of people power i will never let anyone have that kind of power. There is something weird about grown men wearing robes and thinking their so powerful. When they are scum. I will think about any man i see in a robe thinking hes so powerful as the devil. I will laugh at the foolish people that think Catholic priest are like god when here is proof they are not.,1519689600,,624,4.1652892561983474

7576655,5,B019NB5EVG,Well written and acted.  It was a really good film.  The most difficult part of watching the film was the knowledge that it was written based on true events and that many people suffered for a long time. The best part of watching the film was learning of the people who helped bring it to light.,1516924800,,295,4.25

7576664,5,B019NB5EVG,"Profound courage is required to stand up against skewed politics, and the massive weight on the shoulders of these (Catholic) reporters makes for one of  2015s most powerful, disturbing, and moving films.

7576668,5,B019NB5EVG,"The truth is always stranger than fiction and that's why it makes for the best movies. Spotlight is the 2016 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture and it was well deserved. This star studded cast comes together to tell the true story of how the Boston Globe was finally able to breakthrough the decades long wall of silence, and expose the Catholic Church's child molestation scandal. Michael Keaton headlines this all-star cast and shows that while he's been out of the spotlight (pun intended) for some time now, he hasn't lost a beat. As the enigmatic leader of the newspaper's Spotlight section, Walter Robinson (Keaton) will not give up the fight for the truth, no matter the personal cost. Even when his own bosses tell him the story is dead and to give up, he refuses to let it go and he shows that one man with a mission really can change the world. This film doesn't simply shine a light on the Catholic Church in a way it would rather nobody ever had, but it also gives views an in depth, inside look at all the intricacies that go into investigative journalism. With all the reports of fake news and all of us who simply get our news from staring at a screen, it's hard to think about all the effort that goes into getting that information from real life to print and I personally found the process fascinating. This film has a lot going for it, from an inside look at a long forgotten industry to the mysteries behind a long hidden secret. It features some terrific writing and more than one outstanding performance. You don't get six Oscar nominations by accident. This is a great film and a great addition to our list of can't miss movies!",1513123200,,1653,4.513333333333334

Nothing new in the film about Catholic priests molesting children, but this film brings it to the ""Spotlight"" where it should be. Catholics will no doubt hate the film, but it speaks the truth. Sadly, Catholics aren't alone in pedophilia, but they're the most prolific since they're forced to be celibate.",1512518400,,421,4.780821917808219

7576712,4,B019NB5EVG,"Great acting all around. A gripping story following a sympathetic team of investigative journalists who are trying to uncover a criminal conspiracy involving one of society's most influential institutions. Even given its negative portrayal of the Catholic Church, the Church's most conservative and loyal defenders have actually lauded this movie for its accurate depiction of the events. Yet...there's one big problem with the movie that is actually encapsulated within three very small lines. The people who made this movie (and being Hollywood, you can take a guess as to which group wields disproportionate power) made the very conscious choice to have this story completely de-link the scandal from any connection with the homosexuality of its perpetrators, despite the fact that 90% of the crimes involved men preying on boys (mostly young teens, i.e. hebephilia). at one point a character declares ""It has nothing to do with being gay!"". In another scene an ""expert"" informs us that clerical celibacy is to blame, since it forces priests to engage in secrecy about sexual acts and so...uh... prey upon boys and...uh...well, I can't really summarize it because it doesn't even make much sense. In another scene a character informs us that the fact that the sex crimes were mostly homosexual in nature could be explained solely by the fact that the victimizers calculated that males would feel more shame than females and thus be less likely to rat them out to the authorities. That is completely ridiculous and a blatant distortion of the facts.

The Church behaved abominably and nothing can whitewash it. While it is true that only 6% of priests are estimated to have abused children, a figure that is actually lower than secular professions like teachers, doctors and Boy Scout leaders, it is also estimate that somewhere around 60% of the bishops during this time period moved predators around in an effort to sweep things under the rug. Priests who never committed a crime themselves also were complicit in knowing about this abuse, and sometimes even witnessing it, and never doing anything about it. Yes, it would be worth while to explore how the psychological profession at the time convinced the hierarchy that these abusers could be rehabilitated, but there was a great sin and degeneracy in the Church apart from the men who actually hurt the children. By all means, excoriate them. But let's not lie about the roots of why men did these things to young boys in the first place.",1500508800,,2496,5.043583535108959

I found it oddly ironic that a story exposing pedophile priests hiding behind religion was side railed by a story (9/11) regarding a pedophile following terrorist group, Muslims, also hiding behind religion.  That is ironic.

7576754,5,B019NB5EVG,"Spotlight ( 9 out of 10)  Everyone has pet peeves when it comes to movies. We hate romantic comedies based entirely on misunderstandings, we hate horror films where no one's cell phone works,  or we simply hate movies that have either the word Adam or Sandler on the poster.

I hate true story movies that simply make things up. You know the type. We need a bad guy so let's take a real person and turn him into a racist (Hidden Figures), a murderer (Titanic), or a woman (Patch Adams). We need to condense the timeline and change real historical events (Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures again). We need to change the character's sexuality so modern audiences can relate (The Danish Girl). We need facist slaveholders to talk about democracy and freedom (300). And the list goes on and on. This is without even mentioning Mel Gibson historical dramas that might as well have dinosaurs wandering through them.

One of my other pet peeves? Movies that take place in an office or business world made by people who clearly have never spent more than a day working in one. Like ahistorical true stories, this is ripe territory for rage. We have the office politics of Catwomans evil beauty cream manufacturer. Not to be outdone the less said about how Wayne Industries is run ( a publicly traded company mind you) in the Batman universe the better. It isn't just superhero movies either. Romantic comedies often need a trip to HR and no making everyone an architect does not solve that. (Seriously do these movies even know what architects or museum directors or magazine publishers actually do during their work day?)

Spotlight easily could have fallen into both these traps. It simply doesnt. The timeline is correct. The discussions between professionals sound well professional. There are no made up heavys to create drama, no fake romantic love interest, no surprise terrorist attack. Okay, it does have the last one but in all fairness, the movies timeline starts in August 2001 and runs through the end of the year. But even in that moment, the movie handles it with intelligence and in a realistic manner.

There is a calmness and a professionalism in this movie that is refreshing. It rings true in both the big and small things. It is one of the best films I have seen this year.",1490572800,,2283,4.752525252525253

The group of journalist who investigated rumors about sexual abuse in the church found that 80 priests were involved in a  series of crimes that have been going on for centuries, and that was covered up by top authorities in the church. The accused clergy was reassigned to different jobs to cover up their crime and protect them and keep this ugly demonic crime a secret from the whole world. The most disgraceful thing about this scandal is that religious authorities covered up sexual abuse ( rape) in the Catholic church while teaching their members to obey the word of God. Richard Shaw is the author of Writing As Consolation.  Audible,Kindle, and paperback.",1488758400,,768,4.9
7576766,3,B019NB5EVG,"When Hollywood chose to address the topic of child sexual abuse among Catholic priests, it approached the topic with a story about the ""Spotlight"" team that investigated and published its revelations in the Boston Globe newspaper, hence the movie's title. The story takes place in 2001, when the Globe's new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), encourages the paper's investigative reporting unit to focus its attention on an accusation that Boston's Cardinal Law wittingly allowed priests who have been accused of child abuse to continue in positions in which they have contact with children. Spotlight's editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) is skeptical of the story's viability, but reporter Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) jumps at the opportunity. The team faces sealed documents, victims and lawyers reluctant to talk, and a political and social establishment eager to protect the Church's reputation.

Approaching this topic through the journalists who investigated the prevalence of abuse cases produces a great deal of distance between the audience and the people affected by the events, namely the victims and the priests. This would be so even if the intrepid reporters were not smug, dull, and self-involved, which they are. For over two hours, a small group of reporters Robinson, Rezendes, Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James), and Ben Bradlee, Jr. (John Slatterly)- talk to each other and make the rounds of lawyers, victims, priests, and Church officials. This is flat and fails completely to engage on an emotional level. There is no drama. The only characters that hint at dramatic content are Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the founder of a victim's organization who accuses the priests of ""spiritual abuse"" among other things and features in only one scene, and victims' attorney Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci).

While ""Spotlight"" fails as drama, it also fails to inform. In the end, 249 priests were accused of inappropriate sexual contact with children or minors. But we never know exactly of what they are accused or did, so it's impossible to come to any conclusion as to how to judge them or the Church's response. Only two victims recount their experiences: one who was coaxed into a game of strip poker and sex as a teenager, another who was groped at age twelve. Are these stories meant to be typical victims' experiences? They can't be examples of the worse abuse. We never have any idea whether priests are being accused of rape, pedophilia, unlawful sex with minor teenagers, consensual or violent activity. It's a total muddle. And a psychologist, Richard Sipe (Richard Jenkins), makes various proclamations on the topic of child sexual abuse by priests in a disembodied voice over the phone. It's weird, and the movie takes his statements as fact.

""Spotlight"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2015. That's not unexpected, as the Academy likes to congratulate itself on its social conscience. But this is among the worst films ever to win the Best Picture award, and the critics missed the mark. It fails completely to be cinematic or dramatic, and it fails to inform or clarify its topic, which is certainly worthy of representation. But the story is either found in the trauma and betrayal of the victims or in the politics, corruption, and moral failure that shaped the Church's response, not with a bunch of reporters. I imagine it was exciting to investigate this story for the Boston Globe, but that does not come across in the film either.",1488758400,,3530,5.125

7576774,1,B019NB5EVG,"Paedophiles use Christianity as a cover and a prop to manipulate others into thinking they are trustworthy people,they don't appreciate the institution of the Church; they use their position to manipulate people, for impression management purposes.

This is basically a hit piece directed against Catholics at a minimum & all Christians in actuality. This film failed to impress at the box office $$ and those awards it received were based on the worthiness subject matter. The population is now in a state of mass hysteria about paedophile priests & the Roman Catholic church is terrified of being accused of protecting paedophiles. Many of the finger pointers are not even motivated by concerns of child safety they are just keen to see the destruction of the Church.

""It took a Jewish newspaper editor to expose the scourge of abuse in the Catholic Church""

Bringing this message into the public sphere and subsequently giving it massive acclaim (Two Oscar wins and several Oscar nominations) and prominence could make a mind wonder if this film is deliberately demonstrating a bias and is operating in favour of those who seek the degradation & devaluation of Christian people. The question needs to be asked,is film media being used as a way of doing harm to the Christian church and expressing hatred toward Christian people.

David Pierre published a book entitled 'Sins of the Press: The Untold Story of the Boston Globes reporting on Child Abuse in the Catholic Church' which provides examples of distortions,omissions and inaccuracies in the Globes reporting. This does tend to suggest that anti-Catholicism could have been a driving motivation behind the Boston Globe's campaign rather than the pure altruism of child protection. The Globe newspaper has also been accused of serious hypocrisy due to the fact it it had previously downplayed and minimised child abuse and had even promoted the careers of known paedophiles who were homosexual rights activists.

Child abusing sociopaths are attracted to positions in the community where they are granted an instant authority and there is no evidence that the number of abusers in the Catholic church is higher than clergy from any other religious organisation. The abuse figure is thought to be lower than school teachers and significantly less than offenders in the general population of men. At the risk of getting into a statistical argument about a highly emotive issue .... child abuse is usually perpetrated within the immediate and extended family & if you were to only look at children who were sexually abused by non familial exceptionally trusted professionals, the actual prevalence of such abuse is tiny in relation to the amount of contact they have with vulnerable children.

The Christian Church is being cast as the refuge of paedos when in fact, priests abuse children at the same rate as everyone else-about 2%. If you allowed yourself to be influenced by the mainstream media and films like this, you would naturally assume it was 99% of the clergy that were paedophiles. It is common knowledge that Hollywood is controlled by some very warped and unprincipled people,it has a very serious problem with paedophilia and so the posturing of this film is slightly laughable in my opinion.",1487548800,,3265,5.1163227016885555

Cardinal Law was the one who wanted it covered up and did nothing except move to the Vatican and lives in luxury.

7576809,5,B019NB5EVG,"Given its genre, I consider Spotlight to be as close to being a perfect movie as any recently made that Ive seen.  The film has no action scenes and is entirely dialog driven.  With a running time of 2 hours and nine minutes, one might think that such a picture would be considered unlikely for public acceptance.  In fact, after three viewings, I find that this engrossing film seems to flash by, totally lacking in any slow moments thanks to exceptionally adept writing, acting and editing.

The film is based on a true story based of the efforts of an investigative team of the Boston Globe newspaper in exposing a Catholic priest suspected of sexually abusing children. The incident is initially believed to be uncommon in nature but additional information from various sources leads the team to suspect that this sort of offense had been happening more frequently and over a much greater period of time than initially believed.  As one of the attorneys involved in the case advises a member of the investigating team: The Church thinks in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.  Do you think your paper has the resources to take that on?  It is suspected that common practice has been to prevent these incidents from becoming public knowledge and to reassign the offending priests from one parish to another in the attempt to avoid outside disclosure.  This story from the Boston Globe was instrumental in the world-wide exposure of such offenses.

This excellent though disturbing film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay making it the first Best Picture winner to receive less than three Academy Awards since The Greatest Show on Earth of 1953.  Spotlight won many other awards and accolades for 2015.",1484784000,2,1726,4.9206896551724135

7576827,5,B019NB5EVG,"Hollywood has a minor love affair with the newspaper industry, with notable films ranging from the sharp-edged comedy HIS GIRL FRIDAY to the meticulously realistic ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN.  Even so, in an era that favors car wrecks and CGI effects, SPOTLIGHT had some difficulty getting made, and although the script was admired, no one seemed to expect much from it.  But the film won a slew of accolades and, much to the industrys surprise, picked up an Academy Award for Best Film as well.

Based on factual events, SPOTLIGHT tells the true story of the Spotlight teama group of investigative journalists working at The Boston Globewho unravel a scandal of child molestation in the citys Roman Catholic Church to expose Cardinal John Laws participation in a cover-up of the same.  Although the reportage focused on the Boston diocese, the reportage would ultimately impact on the church all the way to the Vatican, and the churchs response to the film is indicative of the changes that ensued: instead of outraged denials, the Vatican praised the film as well-made and inspirational.

SPOTLIGHT is a very low-key, un-fussy film with a memorable script that keeps a tight focus on its protagonists as they set about their work.  The Spotlight group is led by Walter Robby Robinson, played by Michael Keaton in what may be the finest moment of his career; other players include Rachel McAdams, Lieve Schreiber, John Slattery, and Brian dArcywith Mark Ruffalo particularly memorable (he received a Best Supporting Actor nomination) as reporter Michael Rezendes.  The first half of the film nails everything in a very exacting way, and there were several moments when I teared up in sympathy and horror as the survivors of molestation recalled their ordeal.  The film seemed to be a bit thin as it passed the midway point, but it returned to a five star level for the conclusion.

Although the frame in which the story is displayed is the Roman Catholic Church molestation scandal, some critics have observed that it goes deeper than that: SPOTLIGHT is less about a particular scandal than it is about the power of a first-rate newspaper when it sets out to find and expose the truthand first-rate newspapers are increasingly hard to come by these days.  I would agree with that and I would go a bit further: it is also about the price good and honest people are prepared to pay to pay for the truth.  Powerful stuff and strongly recommended.

7576835,5,B019NB5EVG,"With over 4,000 reviews that are almost entirely positive, another might not be necessary, but SPOTLIGHT was so excellent that more said on some aspects of this film that haven't been mentioned could encourage more to see it.  Negative reviews claim that it was boring, slow, not graphic enough and without a thrilling ending.  There are helpful reviews that offer a synopsis of this film that other potential viewers might read, but this one jumps too some of the details that have been criticized.

What I found so skillful was the lack of the actual acts of sexual abuse by predatory clergymen, and instead, we see the fall out from victims whose lives were destroyed and families who were struggling to set things on the side of repair, and often without accompanying dialogue.  We see Mark Ruffalo's character hovering at the entrance of the church, listening to a choir of children singing Christmas carols and the message comes through clearly that he is reliving the moments his own faith had been crushed by the Catholic church.  We also view Rachel McAdam's character, raised as a Catholic, continuing her numerous and compassionate interviews with adult victims of predatory priests as they crumble behind the information they are giving, the content of which we cannot hear.  These brief and quiet scenes were so powerful.

This film moved at a fast enough pace for me and if there were any pauses in the action, they were small moments to absorb the magnitude and implication of the information that was being gathered.  What came through so clearly was not only the horrid sexual violation of children, but the devastation and shattering of faith in a trusted institution that blatantly underscored its realms of protection, its direct conduit to god, the championing of the family unit, and it could be added, its fervent discouragement of and falsified justification for limiting the numbers of children within it.  More victims for the 6% of abusing priests down the line.

The effect of this film is like the snow ball that grows larger and gathers speed as it travels down hill.  It does not come to rest in the final scene within the Spotlight news room, nor does it rest as numerous cities and countries are listed in the credits that were effect by this cover up of abuse through a legendary and extremely wealthy institution of faith that spans the globe.

Stanely Tucci, as the character of Mitchell Garabedian said, if it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to support its abuse.

I have seen this film 3 times and the effect of its skill and power has not faded, but the yearning for more investigative journalism has increased.  Hoping others will see this film.",1483660800,,2706,4.816414686825054

7576884,5,B019NB5EVG,"I admit that I had professional interest in this film, having majored in journalism and worked as an editor-and that is what why I chose to view it. For me it was a great movie but i think others without my background will enjoy it also because the ending reveals somewhat of a who-dun- it. Characters are as you expect: intense, driven reporters who want to protect boys from the overbearing Catholic Church in Boston. Apparently quite a few people in and out of the church knew this was happening in Boston for years, but it took a new editor at the daily newspaper to focus a group of reporters to uncover all the facts. Story is also told using interviews of the now-adult altar boys who were assaulted.
I am a lapsed Catholic, so the ugly story was also of some interest to me. After watching this, I heard from fellow students from my catholic high school that one of our priest/instructors had also been found to be a sexual predator. How awful--so this story was meaningful in many ways for me. See this movie if you want to understand the importance of a strong, active media corps. Good acting/directing.

I love reading the day's events in the newspapers, but now I have to verify it, it stinks, I can't even read a story about crime without reporters putting there own spin on it and convicting law enforcement, by distorting facts by telling and printing unconfirmed stories, causing riots, destruction of neighborhoods, and in rare cases the death of one of my fellow citizens.

The parishioners not being told why Father ? had suddenly been moved to another parish, or to an institution that would cure them.  This is a hard review to write.

7576953,5,B019NB5EVG,"Spotlight, 2015 film

It begins in Boston Massachusetts. Policemen talk about an event. Outside the snow tells of the season. The Boston Globe newspaper holds a meeting about a departing reporter. A new editor arrives from Miami. Spotlight is an investigative team of reporters. Readership is down, the Internet competes for Classified Ads, they need to examine costs. Can they do better? They talk about the charges of child molestation by a priest; is there a story here? Did the Cardinal know? Can they learn about the sealed documents? They will covers this but must be discreet. This will interest the readers. There is a time limit on these crimes, the victims don't want publicity. A reporter talks to lawyer Garabedian about his cases. We see huge paper files on old stories. There is a pattern in shifting priests around. [There is padding in these scenes at the baseball stadium, golf course, etc.]

Should a newspaper stand alone to function best? [Yes, if it is to review other institutions and their leaders.] They meet the SNAP organization leader, who tells about his past. Treatments Centers are for priests who get caught. A reporter wants to talk to some of the victims, but they don't want publicity. The victims came from troubled families. Some killed themselves. The investigation continues for more victims and more priests. How can they do research on a priest who wasn't in the news? There are records on priests for any given year. A lawyer cant talk about confidential agreements. There are no court records for private remediations. A lawyer talks about Boston and its culture. Sick leave and other terms are used for priests who are offenders and transferred from parish to parish. What are the percentages? Can it be verified? It will take a lot of work to list the names. A spreadsheet collects them.

They locate 87 names in Boston, and an address. There were a list of names given to the Boston Globe decades ago says a lawyer. Cases were settled against 45 priests. Was this done by the institution to shield itself? Reporters talk to people, they were told to keep quiet. One ex-priest talks until his sister ends the conversation. Lawyer Garabedian tells about one case which has public documents. Check the docket. A legal motion must be filed to recover 14 documents. The 9/11 terror attacks become high priority now. Then the investigation continues. A reporter wants those public records, he makes copies for the Boston Globe!

Will it be printed now? People need the church especially now says one man. The newspaper wants to get the institution, not a few men. They plan to publish the story but must be careful of retaliation (like calls tying up the telephone lines). The publication results in more calls from victims. During 2002 Spotlight published close to 600 stories about the scandal. 249 priests and brothers were accused of sexual abuse. The number of survivors is estimated to be well over 1,000. In December 2002 Cardinal Law resigned from the Boston Archdiocese and was reassigned. Major abuse scandals were uncovered in other places and countries; its not just one area.

This is an educational and intellectual movie not an action movie. Have these crimes been going on for the past century, or is it a modern happening? This movie could have been shortened by about 15 minutes. The power of the Church comes not just from its wide membership but their role as a partner in the Establishment or Ruling Class. What churches have protested government policies? One rule for everyone is to beware of people from a higher class or status who take a personal interest in you and pretend friendship. Any other suggestions?",1476835200,,3674,4.890850722311397

7576965,5,B019NB5EVG,"I watched this film without expectations and I was wonderfully pleased. This movie is a true suspense/drama. Not a drama disguised as a low-budget action flick, nor a secret/spicy, unnecessary nude love scene thrown in the middle of the movie in a hap-hazard fashion. Developing a movie based upon actual events usually creates a solid plot and this film did a great job of bringing the dramatic sequences together to make the viewer become part of the story and become invested in the lives of the characters. It begins rather slowly, but you will be wonderfully rewarded with sticking with the development of the storyline and its characters. I am very glad to have made this purchase.",1476230400,,687,4.880341880341881

As a catholic who became disillusioned with the church long before the scandals became known, I found the movie particularly riveting.  I will watch it again to more fully appreciate the film--there are many layers of story lines that come together flawlessly.

The scenery, the pacing, the thoroughness of details and facts moved the film along as though I were watching the events and the investigation unfold as it it happened. Rarely if ever have I seen a film telling the story of actual events so well done. Fortunately the DVD was in my local public library, in excellent condition, and I was privileged to check it out and watch it almost immediately after I learned about it. Very, very well done, informative, believable in every detail, and I highly recommend it for anyone who cares about excellence in journalism, significant historical phenomena, real life human experience, intelligently written scripts, and superior dramatic presentation.

The movie is even better knowing it was based on a true story. The talking is fast at times and I had to rewind a couple of times to make sure what I heard.

7576996,5,B019NB5EVG,"This movie shows why we MUST keep our newspapers!  The Boston Globe got a new editor in from Miami--Liev Schreiber plays the Jewish editor--and they go after the Catholic Church in BOSTON!  Nearly everyone on the staff grew up Catholic and the idea of going after the priests who raped little girls and boys was anathema to them.

But a special investigative team called Spotlight goes to work and oh what they find!  87 priests in Boston alone are pedophiles that have been transferred from parish to parish hiding the molestation. It went clear to the pope and took place internationally.

It basically came down to the fact that Catholic priests are the only ministers who are celibate--cant have sex.  But 50% of the priests ARE having sex--mostly with other adults.  Time to get rid of the old celibacy and bring it all out into the open.  I am now a lapsed Catholic--so this movie hurt remembering how we little kids were the altar boys and sang in the choir.  It was all around and we were treating these priests like God himself.

One part of the movie that I REALLY liked is they got rid of the term molestation and replaced it with the real word--rape!

This story absolutely underscores why we must have the separation of church and state, why we must have freedom of the press and dedicated investigative reporters, and why we must have screenwriters, actors, producers, directors, and film crews who work so very hard and let their talents shine.  This is not over-dramatic.  It is not done to sensationalize.

This cast is brilliant.  The production and direction is perfectly balanced to bring power to the story and yet be so respectful of all of the people who were victimized -- even the music score felt, at times, like a requiem.  Oh, and Mr. Keaton, bravo.",1474329600,,828,4.920863309352518

It's really amazing, considering how catholic Boston was/is that they managed to uncover what was going on in Boston and of course around the country and the world.  I loved Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton in this.  Great actors who seem to take it all in their stride.  Very well worth purchasing through my Prime Amazon account.

I really don't want to say a whole lot about this movie either, because it is a film that needs to be seen by everyone! Yes, the subject matter is - at best - sensitive - and no, it's probably not a film for young children, but young adults who are in high school could benefit from seeing this film.  At times, when the movie would light up the theatre, I would glance at some of the faces of the people watching the movie (all of whom were older adults), and I could see how upset and disturbed a lot of people where.  It's that powerful.  The cast members are all superb.

Even though the story line is already well known, the film still had me on the edge of my seat. I watched the credits roll still sitting in stunned silence; it's that good.  Perhaps the most important reason to see the film is to remind us that ordinary, dedicated people doing their job right can completely change institutions and society.  I can see why this film won for best ensemble cast.  Everyone in the film is at the top of their game.  Each character is essential, and each actor did them justice.

So disgusting and Scary.... to think that the the catholic church allowed all of their priests that were caught molesting children KEEP DOING IT FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS. They simply sent them to another perish to work.... and molest more and more children... they transferred them over and over and over again.. almost as though the church's goal was to molest as many small children as possible.,1469836800,,690,4.80672268907563

These reporters give their heart and soul to get these facts and to give them to the world.

I thought it was well done in portraying how the Catholic Church kept trying to hide their bad behavior.  Usually the ones who go to church all the time are the ones I stay away from.  I just had a roommate last year in SF who was a staunch Catholic (and a family friend) who was overcharging me by $1300/month (she was only paying $700 for the other half of the apartment) and after we settled the dispute she tried to evict me.  When she figured out that she would go to jail for unlawfully evicting me, she then told me that she was going to sue me instead.

7577212,3,B019NB5EVG,"This movie reminded me of ""All the President's Men"" a movie about newspaper reporters who broke the Watergate story.  Spotlight is about the abuse cases discovered in the Boston area Catholic churches.  The reporters had remarkable perseverance to endure pushback from most institutional interests in the city from the church itself to the legal community who worked for the church.  Furthermore, the reporters clearly understood they were doing something unpopular that would cause much pain and division within their own personal sphere of friends and family.  The movie did not focus much on the failures of any particular individual, rather, the emphasis was to showcase the institutional failure of the church to police itself in a transparent manner.

7577232,5,B019NB5EVG,"This film doesn't even begin to expose the evil. The following quote from ""the Great Landzman"" exactly expresses my own experience: ""There is an accepted subculture of homosexuality among Catholic schoolboys and their beloved priests. The pretended shock of the faithful to unveiled priest boy-rape is a perfected, practiced act, honed over centuries, a masquerade to shield their enabling complicity from the greater uninitiated non-Catholic public who weren't in on it. This was an ingrained culture, like a secret society of cannibals, close knit, tradition bound, formal dinner every evening. They had been doing it for so long they took it entirely for granted and didn't think twice about it. Shame? Does a native cannibal feel shame? This is his cultural heritage that must be protected at all costs. Remorse? They adored the taste of human flesh, its incomparable lusciousness and the good hunt for it; they gloried in it and simply pitied or dismissed those who didnt. It was a prime reason for their being.""",1468627200,,1017,5.132530120481928

7577245,5,B019NB5EVG,"I rarely purchase movies, but I did this one. Having been unfamiliar with how the Roman Catholic priest scandal broke as widely as it did I found Spotlight to be an eye-opening and riveting account of its revelation. I appreciated the film's fast-paced and factual approach and that it avoided sensationalism. I agree with its sleeper Best Picture Academy award.

It's hard to imagine now so many years later the impact that the story originally had especially breaking out in Boston, a predominately Catholic city. But the movie effectively brought the viewer back to 2001-02.

I think the best performances are Michael Keaton's and Stanley Tucci's.  Mark Ruffalo was good overall but I felt that a couple of his scenes near the end that although plausible as stand-ins for the viewers' outrage, struck me as gratuitous - his flare-up at Robby's delay and the scene on the porch with Sascha. I speed through them now on replay.

As to the Church, its lawyers and enablers' own despicable parts in the massive scandal, the film kept focus on the Globe's role and let viewer indignation rise over the facts.  I suppose that's why Ruffalo's part, to me, seemed a bit overplayed.

The Phil Saviano character was effective in demonstrating the long-lasting effect of ritual adult sex abuse on minors.  His frustration over institutional cover-up which included the Globe's earlier near-indifference in going after the full scope of the communal horror lent Spotlight an even-handedness the movie needed for complete credibility.

I liked Liev Schreiber's unruffled manner as the new editor-in-chief Marty Baron but not his delivery. It was hard to catch what he was saying as he was sometimes nearly mumbling. That seems common anymore in modern movies seeking to capture realism in the conversational tone of speech people have. But it makes them as bad as modern singers who leave their listeners in ""Mondegreen land."" In older movies (and songs for that matter) you could hear everyone articulating distinctly.  Baron was also one of the few characters not to use vulgarity. I don't need to hear it on the screen to understand strong negative emotion just because people do talk that way.  I'd drop my rating to 4.5 stars if I could over it but I don't think it deserves only a 4 either.

I'll watch this quite a few times yet, it's that good.",1468540800,,2342,4.903797468354431
7577246,3,B019NB5EVG,"Really interesting and well done, but a little slow. Still worth watching.",1468540800,,74,5.25

7577248,5,B019NB5EVG,Fabulous story and will told.,1468540800,,29,5.0
7577249,5,B019NB5EVG,"This movie neatly encapsulates ""The Boston Globe's"" investigation of the widespread coverup by the Roman Catholic Church of systemic child rape in the U.S. This particular case resulted in the exposure of Bernard Cardinal Law, who was subsequently transferred to the Vatican by Pope John II. The irony that he faced no charges, but was protected by Church authorities, will be lost on no one. However, the movie doesn't address the aftermath of the investigation in any depth, nor the wider effect of the conspiracy on not only the American church, but other countries as well. Instead, it takes us through the investigation by the paper's Spotlight investigative reporting team.

The film's dialogue is smart and fast (the screenplay won a lot of awards), and while they don't show the way stories are covered/investigated in detail, everything they do show is accurate. The gold standard for a movie's portrayal of a newsroom remains ""All the President's Men,"" as old as that film is, but I think this one is nearly tied. There's no drama and no fireworks, just the day-to-day workday of reporters and editors. Coincidentally, the ""The Washington Post's"" Watergate investigation was helmed by Ben Bradlee, and the ""Globe's"" coverage was immediately supervised by Ben Bradlee, Jr. Martin Baron, who was executive editor during the ""Globe's"" investigation - and who insisted the story be covered - is now executive editor at the ""Post."" It's a little like sports teams and coaches - there are only so many people to recruit from for elite teams.

All the acting is remarkable here, but certainly Michael Keaton and Liev Schreiber have to be given special consideration. While Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo received Oscar nominations (and deserved them), it's Keaton and Schreiber who took my breath away. Schreiber, as usual, quietly underplays Baron, and looks like his doppelganger. He's a lurking presence even when his character is off screen. Keaton also quietly underplays Robby Robinson, making his portrayal all the more powerful. Keaton's always been one of America's acting treasures, with a range that few others have. His schizoaffective and hilarious Beetlejuice is as compelling as his subtlety here. I'd watch those two in anything, and hope that they make more movies ASAP.

There have been few complaints about the film by real-life people, possibly since the Vatican itself praised it highly. One thing that ""Spotlight"" proves is that investigative teams are necessary to American journalism. Newspapers aren't irrelevant, and newspapers of record are an integral part of our political system. Their future might be completely on line, but if they maintain the standards of professional journalism, they'll always remain a fundamental way for citizens to find out what corporations, powerful groups, and our government are doing behind the scenes. The pity of it is that investigative units are the first to go during budget cuts, as are senior editors and reporters. In fact, we need some deep investigation of news organizations, and need it fast.

Anyway, watch this movie. Buy it to encourage Hollywood to make more like this one. The world is in crisis, and watching more Transformers or Marvel characters won't help that, nor add to the discussion. Documentaries aren't promoted, and many people think they're boring. I'm sure plenty of people aren't interested in the slightest in seeing ""Spotlight,"" but the rest of us can be grateful it was made.",1468540800,,3475,5.177935943060498

Very interesting regarding the excellent investigative journalism that broke the case, so if you can stay objective and just focus on the story line, you will probably . . . enjoy seems like the wrong word . . . how about, find the acting to be excellent.

The seemingly-endless list of cities where abuse took place establishes that this was an institutional and not an individual problem.  The Catholic Church wasn't the only institution where children were sexually abused, but it was the only one where the abusers were systematically and deliberately shielded from accountability.

Too much concern that the truth would be too horrific to say, but that was the reason for this picture from the beginning. Not enough of the blame that  belonged to Cardinal Law was mentioned, and that his fancy job in the Vatican should have been played up very much and who in the Vatican was responsible for that action. In reality, this whole mess was orchastrated by the Vatican, regardless who the Pope was, and tried to keep silent and not enough emphasis was relegated to that matter. The Actors could have been better and somewhere along the film I got a little bored with it. This picture needs to be remade and this time, I hope it gets down and dirty with the real nitty gritty, so that the movie goers and general public really understand just what really happened and get outraged about it, so that it doesn't ever happen again.",1467849600,,982,4.455555555555556

It's bad enough that religious organizations have pedophiles in their ranks but the fact that they cover it up, try to rehabilitate the pedophiles, while leaving the victims twisting in the wind is inexcusable.

7577315,4,B019NB5EVG,"This is a very good movie with very good acting. I have been reading some of the other reviews here and I must agree with a few of the comments other reviewers make. First, I agree this is a fine investigative journalism film about Boston's pedophile priests. The reporters at the BOSTON GLOBE broke the story. But I also agree that I didn't see any new ground being broken in the presentation and yes, it unfolded just like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. There's nothing wrong with that but decades have gone by and surely a 2015 film should be breaking some new ground.

Second, the focus is almost entirely on the system keeping quiet and covering up. That system is the Catholic Church in Boston and the Catholics in high positions there which made the cover up possible. That's all well and good but I too would have liked to gone deeper with the victims' stories. That is the real hard hitting stuff. We got details of a few stories but it could have been much more dramatic with a more penetrating use of the victims. I'm thinking of ""The Verdict"" which didn't pull any punches in presenting the victim's case in the Boston courts for malpractice against a Catholic hospital. Mamet wrote that screenplay and it really hit hard (I don't think his name appears on the credits although they went with his version).

As for the actors, I thought they were all fine and I especially enjoy that Michael Keaton has been so front and center in films again. I liked Rachel McAdams much better here than I did in ""True Detective Season 2.""",1467158400,,1530,4.5398550724637685

When I was very young,  my mother was outraged that our parish priest Father O'Brien bought a 2 seater Mercedes sports car. It was a valuable lesson for me regarding vows. Priests have a calling.  That calling never includes abuse of authority. What a huge disgrace this movie addresses. It's about time the layers of abuse are addressed so the victims and the repercussions to society can begin to heal.  The Spotlight members were courageous against most odds.

No one is over acting or over dramatizing events which developed over a long period of time. This is character driven which is much more interesting and nuanced then car chases and explosions or over acted break downs for sure. Michael Keaton has always been one of my favorite actors with a substantial range and he seems to to be finding his second act in the last couple of years. Stanley Tucci always disappears in his roles and Ruffalo, McAdams and Schrieber are all excellent.  I know this movie is not to everyone's taste both as a story and the nuanced way it is told, but for me it is definitely a great movie and completely deserved the awards it received.",1465689600,,799,4.548611111111111

I think this film was done with the utmost respect to the victims, many of whom never got justice for what was done to them. And it did a good job at truly emphasizing the lengths to which the Arch Diocese went to cover up these horrible crimes. I wasn't sure if I would be strong enough to go see it in the theatre but I did after it had been out for a few months. Even so, the theatre was packed. Not an empty seat in the house. When the film was over and the credits we're rolling,  you could hear a pin drop. Everyone was silent, they got up and left the theatre not saying a word! It was the most powerful and moving thing I'd ever witnessed. I highly recommend this film to people of all faiths and to those who have been affected by the scandal or not.

7577484,5,B019NB5EVG,"The amazing story of how the investigative team, Spotlight of the Boston Globe, uncovered and reported on the Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal. I've watched this a dozen times or so and love each viewing. It's a movie in the vein of ""All the President's Men"" and like that film will probably become standard viewing in journalism schools.

My favorite parts are when (on multiple occasions) they discover new details on the size and scope of the scandal and how they realize that this was hidden in plain sight. An example of the former is when they're talking to their expert on the phone and mention that they found 11 priests who've possibly abused children. When their experts says that's low and says it could be up to 90 priests, they all just stare at the phone in disbelief. Wonderful scene.

An example of the latter is when several members of the team are in the basement and realize that the church almanac has a hidden code for priests who're being transferred for abuse. They look at each other, then all at once turn to the stack of almanacs in disbelief for a second, then immediately start to grab the almanacs to hide them for their investigation. Another amazing scene.

Another brilliant part is played by Liev Schrieber who as the new editor from out of town, keeps pushing the team to look into this story as important to their readers. Then when the team begins to berate themselves for not seeing this sooner, he reminds them of how we all often are just looking into a mirror dimly and often can't see the larger picture until later. A wonderful example of good leadership.

If you haven't seen this movie, I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1465257600,,1671,4.635135135135135

7577486,5,B019NB5EVG,"It is paramount to revisit again and again issues like this one.  The movie presented a great story with an incredible cast of actors.
I found it again enlightening to learn how long these criminals were allowed to continue their devastating abuse while being shuffled from parish to parish, sheltered by God's name and community indifference.  The stories of the victims were heartbreaking and remind us again that even now our children are not safe from these abusers.  The comment by one actor that ""it takes a village to raise a child and a village to abuse one"" is sadly true.  The list of places in the world where priests picked children and systemically abused them under the noses of their families, with communities watching and turning away, is staggering.  I would suggest Frontline's ""Secrets of the Vatican"" to complete the picture of the real source of this distorted and sick reality.",1465257600,,900,4.894736842105263

7577540,5,B019NB5EVG,"No question that this Academy Award winning film Spotlight is one of the best films not only during the year it was released but for many years to come. This Oscar winner which features the Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team tells us us how the oldest continuously operating newspaper's group of investigative journalist unit in the United States came up with its investigation of the cases of pederasty that committed by numerous Roman Catholic priests at Boston,Massachusetts. It stars a talented ensemble of actors and actresses in Mark Ruffalo,Michael Keaton,Rachel McAdams,Liev Schreiber,John Slattery,Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. It was based on a series of stories by the said team that enabled the newspaper to win the Pulitzer Prize back in 2003.

What makes the film is great is numerous. First,we get to see great performances from its ensemble cast. They portrayed the real-life characters sincerely and accurately. The film did not fall into the trap of trying to maximize the good qualities nor magnify their achievements as well as the hard work they put forth into the newspaper unit. Second,the subject of investigation wasn't really an abomination of the Catholic Church as other films with similar themes do portray. It only reflected the priests who were assigned at Boston. Third,it provides the viewer of what a newspaper should be all about in reporting news and doing investigation like the ""Spotlight"" team. It was obviously not created to sensationalize topics they are investigating for better profit reports but rather for moral urgency and their responsibility to report the truth to the reading public. It also tried to stay away from what most newspapers have become these days and how the team remained true to their identity. In summary,this would make us appreciate them better and it gives investigative journalists a good name.",1464912000,,1869,5.209302325581396

I think what I liked best was the way the blame is never directly doled out, but you know where it lies....with the priests who committed these atrocious acts, the priests, cardinals, lawyers, etc. who covered it up. But also...the community. Who knew something was happening and did nothing. EXCELLENT film. Well deserving of the Best Picture win it took at the Oscars.",1464566400,,734,4.78740157480315

It made me wonder if any of the priest I knew were part of this.  I'll never know and I think that's a good thing - for me.  I cried through most of the movie as the boy's stories were so sad.  All the actors were excellent.  I wanted to see Brian D'Arcy James in a new role and I'd seen him in a Broadway play and loved him.  He is a terrific actor and I was sorry his part wasn't bigger but that's a minor point.  This is a thoughtful and thought provoking movie about a terrible time in the church's history.

I wanted it to provide me with some understanding of what it is like to deal with the aftermath, the prosecution, the outing of such horror.

Spotlight, though, is a movie about the journalists, not the victims.  The victims are there, yes, but this does not provide an exploration of what their lives were like in depth which is what I hoped for. In that vein, I was disappointed.  However, as a script editor, I was not.  This was a clear movie with a clear understanding of the events clearly executed.  If you want to understand the investigation of the Boston Archdioceses, then this is for you. However, if you are looking for insight or answers to the victimization or aftermath in the lives of the children, there is scant here.

7577713,5,B019NB5EVG,"Spotlight, the story of the priests molesting boys began earlier than this story in Boston.  It began in Albuquerque, NM in the 1990's where a number of law suits were filed against the church.  Many of the priests were sent to the treatment center Servants of Paraclete when the church discovered what they were doing to the children.  This center located in Jemez Springs, NM,  is now closed but it was a treatment center (didn't work for them) for these predators. Many of these priests preyed on the Latino poor kids who thought that receiving the priests notice was a gift from God.  Many of these priests went to jail and had to register as sex offenders. These fiends ruined the lives of hundreds of kids and the Church kept transferring them to other churches to keep this hidden. Find this true story on the internet.

Seriously though, it's just dull. There is nothing in this movie that is cinematically interesting. Just scene after scene of people in varying states of agitation either reading or speaking.

Compare this to a movie like Steve Jobs (2015) which is also very dialogue heavy and note all the various ways in which Boyle and crew aid their dialogue through camera movement, interesting angles and shadowing, etc. It makes you realize how thoroughly uninteresting Spotlight is in that particular way. Spotlight could have been done as a picture book with a few sentences of dialogue per page and Mark Ruffalo's happy face or sad face plastered on top.

3 stars though just because the dialogue is on point, the acting is solid, and it is still, after all, a very interesting subject.",1462838400,5,938,4.930379746835443

It really resonated  the idea that Church thinks in centuries. and everything is influenced by them.
The other thing, more important that we cannot forget is that
many people knew about  this and it is easy to turn the blind eye instead of do the right thing.

7577735,5,B019NB5EVG,"I remember when a similar child abuse scandal was revealed in the Philadelphia  not unlike events depicted in ""Spotlight"".  The Cardinal drafted a letter of apology to be read at all masses in the diocese.  After the letter was read our pastor Father Chris, an earnest and well intentioned man, offered his own thoughts.  On the verge of tears Father Chris gave his own apology and expressed his sense of hurt and betrayal by those who should known better.  Father Chris revealed  there were moments where he agonized and thought his vocation  in jeopardy if not for his inherent faith that made him continue..  As a member of the laity I share Father Chris' sense of betrayal but my feeling is the Church is more than the edifices or the men sporting the clerical collar.  It is the people who occupy the pews each day whose intestinal fortitude  keep the Church flourishing now and for centuries to come.  As for the film itself it is probably the best of the year deserving of the Best Picture Oscar.  It is required viewing so that the events depicted in it do not recur.  Some say their faith has been shaken or lapsed by the scandals.  This film is not a condemnation of the Catholic Church as a whole, rather it's quite evenhanded.

The entire city of Boston had overlooked the rampant pedophilia in the catholic church until an out-of-town Jewish editor was hired by the Globe.  He kicked the investigative unit into action.  The pedophiles had been protected by the evil cardinal Law who was hounded out and was promoted to a high position in the Vatican.  The pope who promoted him has subsequently been made a saint by the current pope.  Go figure.

It makes you sick, especially if you watch it soon after watching Black Mass, like I did.  Boston does not come across with anything positive, image-wise, in either of these two great movies.

On and off, I had to wipe tears at the injustices done to so many children. I have learned through a friend who was a rape victim as an adult that your world is suddenly and forever changed after something like this, and if you survive, you spend your life trying to find solid ground and make a good life on it.  It's not about religion, it's about power and evils that get covered up in the name of ""the common good."" How anyone can take that stance I have no idea and those of us who are on the far end of that spectrum have an obligation to stand up, speak out, and/or support those who do. I came away from the movie feeling proud to be a human being in a world that has people like those on the ""Spotlight"" team. This is, in my opinion, a must-see movie. It was handled with dignity and sensitivity and I found it to be quite thrilling to watch the way each phase was handled.

Survivors braved the odds, yet again, to tell their story to attempt to break the chain for future generations, this time they were heard, believed, and protected.

Excellent acting by an ensemble cast made this my favorite movie in several years. Let the Superheroes prowl about the streets, but I am happy to know that there are still people of honor and conviction in the legal and journalistic worlds as well as the many devoted and innocent priests who have suffered from the actions of a few of their brethren.

7577897,5,B019NB5EVG,"Did SPOTLIGHT deserve to win Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards? Maybe, I guess. I still haven't seen all of the nominees yet, but even still I recognize that SPOTLIGHT is an excellent film. Based on true events, it tells how the Boston Globe broke the story about a massive cover-up of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church. It also features an incredible ensemble cast who, although not given much to do individually, work great together in service of a very compelling (and saddening) story. Out of the five actors given top billing, I would say that Liev Schreiber and Mark Ruffalo fare the best, although the rest of the cast don't slouch by any means. Rachel McAdams is perhaps the weakest out of the bunch, but even she mostly holds her own. Far and away, the most important takeaways are the devotion to pursuing the truth no matter where it leads you, as well as the integrity necessary in investigative journalism. Some people have called this the greatest journalism movie since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but I still need to see that in order to make such a comparison. Briefly touching on other matters, I thought the score and cinematography were quite adequate enough to elevate this beyond something that would normally play as a made-for-HBO movie. In particular, I liked the use of substantial tracking shots, which visually reinforced the winding and interconnected paths that the Globe's spotlight team go on in pursuit of their story. Ultimately, there is a lot in here that could shake one's faith in humanity and human institutions, particularly religion, however I never felt like they demonized anyone. It merely acknowledged the imperfections and, some of the time, willful negligence of said institutions and the communities they serve, while also aspiring to better accountability in both. Best Picture winner or not, SPOTLIGHT is hands down one of the best that 2015 had to offer.",1461196800,,1918,4.959627329192546

It is a great emotional story, one that brings the viewer to the edge of their seat, and in the finality justice does come to light. All the secrets are now forever out there. It was the beginning of bringing some of these sexual deviant priests to justice. I am a victim of one of these criminal sexual priests who was protected by the Catholic Church for many years in Detroit.

Nonetheless, his film about real journalism and the dedicated, dogged pursuit of truth inherent to real journalism in the midst of threat and risk, investigative journalism opposed by one of the most powerful forces in the world, and certainly in Boston, Massachusetts, calls for the quote from Arthur Miller's play:  Attention must be paid.

7577954,5,B019NB5EVG,"Spotlight is based on the true story of how the Catholic Church sex abuse scandal was uncovered by a small team of journalists at the Boston Globe investigating allegations of children in the area being raped by priests.

The movie won two Oscars,  Best Picture of the Year  and  Best Screenplay.
The story is brilliantly written and features outstanding performances by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams.

The movie opens up in 1976 where we see a priest being accused of abuse only to have him walk out of the police station without being charged and then fast forwards to  1999 where another priest abuse report comes to surface and captures the attention of the Spotlight Investigative news team.  When the Boston Globe gets a new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) the Spotlight team is given the go ahead to investigate the Catholic Church and the whole deception and coverup slowly unravels.

My wife and I both enjoyed this movie.  It had just the right amount of tension, suspense and drama to keep you engaged for the full two hours.  Spotlight reminded me of the movie  All the Presidents Men from while Rachel McAdams reminded my wife of Erin Brockovich.

It deals with the Boston GLOBE newspaper's attempts early in this century to deal fully, fairly and frankly with the ongoing Catholic-church sexual scandal of working priests committing sexual abuse, then being shuffled or ""reassigned"" only to do it again. Much like PRESIDENT'S MEN, the ongoing political situation is frankly addressed but mostly this is a movie about how journalists work (hard) and think and collaborate under difficult circumstances, so don't expect MYSTIC RIVER.  Do expect engaging, literate entertainment. Top flight cast includes Michael Keaton, John Slattery, Rachel MacAdams and Mark Ruffalo.  The DVD is quite reasonably priced but without supplements.

7577975,5,B019NB5EVG,"Another Important and Courageous Film. From Hollywood. The Best of The Academy. About the very best of the Fourth Estate.
The movie follows what happens when all institutions - the courts, the Church, Schools, other members of the Fourth Estate, the Community, Teachers, even Families are stunned into submission by Money, Evil, Abuse of Power, Secrecy and Shame -- and all of these ""professionals""  #FAIL the children. Also, the movie highlights the importance of ""The Outsider"".

In the bonus material, the real-life Boston Globe staff are fascinating -- round-the-clock dedication on 'Spotlight' stories which usually last a year or more to research and write. The real-life Sacha Pfeiffer, played by the great Rachel McAdams -- you're going to smile because the casting was so perfect - the real Sasha is gorgeous -- she explained how the Pedophile Priests would target and groom heartbroken or troubled children. How some survivors hadn't even told their wives and loved ones yet. How challenging it was to tackle a project where almost nothing is public. Real-life Mike Rezendes, played by Mark Ruffalo: ""The Catholic Church was relying on the First Admendment as much as we were.""

The cast was Blazing! I believe you will remember Liev Schreiber as the editor and Stanley Tucci as the Lawyer (Outsiders, who aren't invested in The Machine) and the restraint and determination of all of the reporters -- because of the blessed relief one FINALLY gets.

This movie is about Priests ""with no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel."" - but: that is Hillary Clinton talking about Black kids.

Michael Keaton's real-life Robby Robinson described how an 87-year-old man reported that he had remained silent about being abused for 75 years!! Sadly Pedophile Priests have, in probably 96% of the cases, which have come to light (that's a guess) Escaped punishment. They have NOT been ""brought to heel."" ""The Truth May Never Be Known"".

It's important to note that in this movie the psychiatrist had stated that about **6%** of Priests are Pedophiles. I'm not sure how this compares to society as a whole. It's a hidden crime. No other criminal is as immune to prosecution as a pedophile or rapist.",1460160000,,2267,4.968337730870712

The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends.",1459987200,2,877,4.8533333333333335

Excellent film clearly identifies why ""reporters didn't [thoroughly] investigate the initial complaints and information from the victims."" - Victims had to sign confidentiality agreements as part of their settlements, and a Boston Globe Metro Section Editor (Keaton's character) dropped the ball on one of the early articles.

That being said, and aside from assigning blame which offers no benefit to the victims, the focus should be on identifying and prosecuting the scumbag pedophiles who pawn themselves off as men of god.

With regard to ultimately breaking the story, this is just one of those very unfortunate cases when we just have to say, 'better late than never'. Enjoy 4x",1459728000,,691,5.2727272727272725

7578004,4,B019NB5EVG,"Spotlight, directed by Tom McCarthy, who co-wrote the screenplay with Josh Singer, is the account (based on actual events) of a close-knit group of Boston Globe reporters who blew the lid off a scandal involving scores of pedophile priests whose crimes were swept under the rug by the church hierarchy. Acted splendidly by a stellar cast, Spotlight emphasizes that taking on the Catholic Church in Boston was huge.  The Spotlight team earned a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for their expos&eacute; of the church's wrongdoing.

The movie opens in July 2001.  Newspapers were still a force to be reckoned with then.  Marty Baron, the Boston Globes new editor-in-chief, portrayed by an assured and commanding Liev Schreiber, wants Ben Bradlee, Jr.s team of investigative journalists, overseen by  Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), to find evidence that top officials in the Boston Archdiocese (including Cardinal Bernard Law) covered up for clerics who molested youngsters in their congregations.  The traumatized victims often remained silent. They felt guilty and ashamed, and feared that no one would believe them.

Where Spotlight falls a bit short is in its unimaginative execution. There are predictable sequences in which frantic reporters work ridiculously long hours, become frustrated when they hit dead ends, and urge as many victims as possible to come forward.  The members of the investigative team pore over old newspaper clippings and parish records, looking for the smoking gun that will make their case.  The villains are smug and arrogant, while some of the adults who had been molested as children courageously decide to speak out.  Spotlight breaks little new ground cinematically, but it reinforces the importance of an unfettered and independent press.  The bonus features show members of the cast and the real life characters they portray, all of whom discuss the aforementioned themes and the making of the film.",1459641600,,1935,5.332236842105263

I don't think so.  My Mom was often called a smothering mom....I think nowadays the term is helicopter.  It was the 50's and she was home all the time.  And had her nose in everything.  My dad was very present too.  But the thought still lingers.  So just a warning to others to perhaps watch this movie with care.

All that said, I'd like to know when all the lawyers who made money off the under the table lawsuits against the churches will be brought out into the open.  Don't they deserve to be exposed as well?",1459641600,,681,4.1692307692307695

But Spotlight is a very good movie about one of the most important moments in the Catholic faith and of the city of Boston. Michael Keaton leads the movie and does a great job as always. Along with the always good Mark Ruffalo, the cast is very good in telling this important story. I would put Spotlight in the arena of the great movies involving journalism, probably 3rd only to George Clooney's Good Night and Good Luck revolving around Edward R.

7578133,5,B019NB5EVG,Fascinating movie about the Catholic Church pedophiles priest scandal in Boston. The story had been there in front of them but was ignored for years. Finally as the reporters focus on the story we see how Boston's Catholics try to prevent it from becoming front page material.

7578225,2,B019NB5EVG,Surprised this Best Film really is not all that informative or new.  I give the movie credit for not sensationalizing the events and letting the reporters have their moment with their flaws in seeing what they could not believe.  But I must admit I need cinema in movies and by that I need interesting exposition as well as dialogue.  I kept imagining more creative directors and how they could present this event and information.  There is one moment of interest as the try to create a database of priests before those things were presumed to be available and maybe when some documents are opened for public view.  Really the big story at this point which this movie touches on slightly is why reporters did not respect and investigate the initial complaints and information from the victims.,1459209600,2,793,4.801470588235294

As shocking and abhorrent the sexual sins by men cloaked in the office of priesthood, the acts of those who plotted to cover and hide the sin are guilty of a far greater offense.  And the attempt to justify any of it for the sake of the ""greater good"" is twisted and demented in the most foul way.

I did not want to watch this movie because the whole matter is so sickening.  I was compelled to watch because it is so vitally important to not hide from the truth, not just of this story but of man's capacity for evil.  Thanks to Spotlight for your perseverance in the face of personal and professional threat and to the creators of this movie - you managed to present the story in a manner that was faithful to the actual events, avoided sensationalism, stirred compassion for the victims (even those who would become perpetrators) and hatred for the sins of abuse and deception.",1459209600,,995,4.5363128491620115

7578447,5,B019NB5EVG,"I was familiar with the real story that hit the news back in the early 2000s that this movie is based and in a lot of ways it strikes me on a personal note as I have a bit more than a casual familiarity of the story.  The abuses by priests were largely ignored (especially by the Catholic Church) until the exposure of the scandal involving the priest Geoghan in Boston (of which this story is based) and the others that followed soon after in Boston and other cities, such as Vincent McCaffrey in Chicago and others elsewhere.  This movie has a strong cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Live Schreiber among others and they all play their respective roles very well and believably.  This movie is excellently done.  The story is both compelling and very accurate in how it describes the abuses and the cover-up by the church.  The movie handles the subject of priest abuse delicately that respects the victims while at the same time exposing those who had abused children for decades.  It is unfortunate that a lot of those abusers escaped justice by either passing away before being exposed or because of the statute of limitations having passed.

The movie has a powerful message but does in an excellent way with a story that the directors smartly let it tells itself based on the facts of the real events that it is based.

8745556,5,B019NB5EVG,"Spotlight is one of two films that should be required viewing for journalism students. The Spotlight team uncovered a massive cover up in the Boston Archdiocese in Boston, Massachusetts in the early 2000s. Boston was rooted in its Irish Catholic roots. Boston is the hometown of the Kennedys and Bulgers as well. The film uncovered not only the abuse of power by pedophile priests but those who covered up their crimes including the Cardinal, Bishops, law enforcement and lawyers. The film conveyed how powerful the Catholic Church is in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Boston Globe's Spotlight team were determined to report an accurate account of the abuse, the lack of consequences and the cover-up under the Cardinal's power. The abuse has been widespread around the world. Boston was the first to attempt in uncovering it and successfully did so. The stories of survivors is widespread. The film has an all-star cast like Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and more to tell this story.

The film DVD has other features like the real reporters; the importance of journalism and a look inside ""Spotlight."" The film doesn't go into showing or depicting the abuse but rather alluding to it in verbal accounts. The real story was the cover-up in protecting predator priests over innocent, vulnerable children.",1533168000,,1345,5.165137614678899
