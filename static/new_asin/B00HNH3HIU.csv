6185245,3,B00HNH3HIU,"So much beauty was in the first one when it came to a balance of elements, like humor, character development, family relational conflicts, romance, discovering ""a whole new world"" (and it actually did visually emulate that section of Disney's Aladdin!), and a theme of prejudice.  #2 did some new things by introducing a backstory of Hiccup's parents' relationship and making Hiccup have a little bit of an identity crisis about whether he can handle being the next chief.  Thematically, it's got as much potential for a great movie as #1.  But I didn't like it nearly as much, for reasons I will put below in list form.  It's hard to verbally make a case for a movie being less great than its predecessor when the reasons are so subjective, such as ""less fresh than the original"", as words like ""fresh"" can mean lots of different things.  But I'll do my best.

1.  Freshness of dialogue comparison:  The 1st one felt so fresh to me, and it was amazing to me not to hear a bunch of stupid pop culture references, yet a vernacular which feels easy to relate to.  The style is the same on this one.  In #1, there were so many funny lines of dialogue which helped create the awkward character of Hiccup and his community.  This time, the only relationship which gets notable humorous development is Hiccup and his girlfriend Astrid, near the beginning, as she's teasing him about his awkward demeanor.  The other relationships have a little bit of banter like in the 1st movie, but there's not a lot of new humorous touches, which was one of the things which made #1 so special.
2.  Lightheartedness comparison:  While the word ""lighthearted"" isn't the first word that comes to mind for the 1st movie, a lighthearted attitude about battling dragons was a huge part of the appeal for me in #1.  At no point did the story get so dark in #1 that there was an extended period of no humor:  there's a touch of humor in Hiccup and Astrid's relationship only 2-3 minutes after Hiccup's dragon gets taken away as a captive on the Viking expedition, the darkest point.  This one didn't take the pains the 1st one did to keep humor in the mix.  Part of why I like adventure stories such as Robin Hood or Indiana Jones are their constant humorous touches, which resonate because they make light of situations which are incredibly dark.  There's an art to knowing when it's appropriate to keep a situation tense and when to add humor, or sometimes having tension WITH humor, and the National Treasure and Pirates of the Caribbean movies got that down, as did the 1st How to Train Your Dragon.  This sequel forgot about humor for the most part.  A man-vs.-dragons conflict doesn't seem like a good context for humor, but #1 MASTERED it.  Instead, #2 took the Harry Potter route of making it deliberately more intense than the previous one, a cosmic struggle against great evil with hardly any humorous exchanges.  I would argue that a fantasy series involving growing in maturity doesn't need to be intentionally darker in its sequels, just needs new horizons to explore.
3.  Visual and pacing comparison:  An enormous part of the 1st one's sense of wonder came from Hiccup's exploratory rides on the dragon.  The whole movie up to that point, halfway to 2/3 through, I was wanting to see more of the world he lives in, eagerly awaiting him getting to ride the dragon.  The shots of him flying through the air were very thrilling.  Naturally, that type of wonder would be much harder to maintain in a sequel, because everyone in the community rides dragons now.  However, now they get to explore new islands, and Hiccup is spending his time mapping 'em out.  The visuals are comfortable for a while, and there's something new to delight the eye when Hiccup discovers unnatural ice formations and a secret dragon haven, but pretty soon dragons start filling up the screen non-stop in a Lord of the Rings style cosmic battle, and the beautiful interaction of dragon, human, and landscape is lost.  Halfway through, I felt like there was already visual overload and like there needed to be some slowing down of the pace.  One mostly satisfying slowdown occurs when Hiccup gains hope about a new life with both his parents, but knowing the plot formula, I anticipated that the peaceful moment was soon going to be interrupted by a great crisis, and of course it was.  I forgive that cliche, but I felt like the video game style of visual overload eventually made me bored instead of interested, and didn't heighten the sense of wonder for me like #1.  Remember how cool the climax was in #1?  This had that potential, but only if it didn't overload you visually before that.  Instead, it did.

I did like the slight alterations made to the Hiccup and Astrid characters to make them seem 5 years older, while fully retaining their personalities.  I also know that it's easy to see faults in works of art like this movie but hard to see what should have been done differently.  I think the 3 main things which would have strongly helped this movie would be 1) Don't try so hard to change the tone to a darker, more serious one, but retain the lighthearted attitude and add more humorous touches.  2) Don't visually overload the screen with huge armies of dragons for so much of the movie, but take more time to explore the environment and build up to a visual spectacle at the climax.  3) Slow down the pace more.

#2 is to #1 as Peter Jackson's Hobbit movies are to his Lord of the Rings trilogy:  Similar in ways, but more focused than previously on visual spectacle.  In the 50s and 60s, there were many ""spectacle"" movies, designed to compete with television, but only a few of them stood out, including Ben-Hur, which kept a personal focus through the whole movie and refused to become melodrama.  (Melodrama emphasizes action and emotion over authenticity.)  John Ford's westerns stood out from B westerns because they refused to become melodrama.  How to Train Your Dragon 2 (and the new Hobbit movies) needed less melodrama.",1402704000,29,6010,4.669201520912548
6185246,5,B00HNH3HIU,"""How To Train Your Dragon 2""
(Dreamworks, 2014)
. . . .

The first ""How To Train Your Dragon"" film is a huge favorite in our family, though I have to confess when I saw the previews for HT2 I wasn't totally on board: how could this sequel live up to the sheer magic of the original? Still, we were there on opening day, goggles on and ready for some 3D dragon action.

I'm happy to report that ""How To Train Your Dragon 2"" is a wonderful movie, a worthy and wisely produced follow-up, with several things going in its favor. First, it doesn't try to match the tone of the first film - this one has, in some ways, a lighter tone, although in other ways, heavier consequences for the action scenes. Second, although it subtly references the ""Dragons Of Berk"" TV series, the new film stands alone as a wholly satisfying sequel to the first. The dragons look cool, and the character development has emotional impact (mostly concerning our hero Hiccup, and of his dragon pal/alter ego Toothless.) There are some spectacular visual images, although the 3D effects seemed muted in comparison to the first film (which I think has some of the finest 3D yet seen on screen...)

And most of all, there's Toothless. While most of the other dragons are played for comedy, the visual design and facial animation of Toothless is extraordinary: I'm sure every single person in that theater today left wishing they could have a dragon just like him, and the emotional bond between Toothless and Hiccup still resonates, giving this film a warmth and vibrancy that all can enjoy. I'm ready: bring on Number Three!! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1402704000,2,1652,4.689655172413793
6185247,5,B00HNH3HIU,I just watched this movie...I love it and cant say enough good things about it.  I can't wait for it to come out on dvd... I LOVE THIS MOVIE cant wait for more.,1402704000,2,160,3.8484848484848486
6185248,5,B00HNH3HIU,"As we already know, five years ago a young Viking boy Hiccup and his pet dragon Toothless, united dragons and Vikings on their island. This has changed the society of Berk: now the old bunch of friends hold dragon races while our hero and his dragon set out to chart new territory and draw maps of the known world. They find a secret ice cave and our story begins.

Here is the cast:
  * Jay Baruchel (""How To Train Your Dragon"") is Hiccup, motherless son of a king, still trying to promote peace, not war. His dragon Toothless still sports that repaired tail, do you remember when that was done?
  * Cate Blanchett (""Blue Jasmine"") is Valka, whom Hiccup discovers in that ice cave. What he finds out about Dragon Rider is a big surprise!
  * Gerard Butler (""How To Train Your Dragon"") is Hiccup's father, Stoick, now proud of his son, who didn't turn out at all like he expected.
  * Craig Ferguson (""How To Train Your Dragon"") is Gobber, a goodhearted sidekick to the king.
  * America Ferrera (""How To Train Your Dragon"") is Astrid, still fearless and feminine, all at the same time.
  * Djimon Hounsou (""Baggage Claim"") is Draco, a fierce dragon hunter who intends to rule them all!

Of course we still have the usual suspects as our hero's friends, but the star here is the Computer Generated Imaging, which allows the little 'uns in the audience to experience the sensations of flight. I looked around and every child was transfixed; this was probably just like their dreams. In addition, the ability of the animators to convey subtle emotions is amazing; they get better and better.

I'll be the first to admit I don't remember when or how Hiccup lost his leg, but he clearly has a prosthesis and there is NO comment made about it. Did I watch the first one carelessly? Yes, I must have. Please read the first comment sent in by Robin. Thanks!

The children were enraptured and I had a wonderful time. I did NOT $pring for the premium co$t of 3D, because to me, the story is the thing... You'll see what I mean when you get the DVD from Amazon.",1402704000,8,2051,4.473118279569892

6185251,5,B00HNH3HIU,"If, like me, you liked (or more like me, absolutely loved) the first film, then you're not going to be disappointed by How to Train Your Dragon 2.  Written and directed by Dean DeBlois (who co-directed and co-wrote the first film and also gave us Lilo & Stitch), this film if anything actually raises the very high bar set by the first film.  The same creative team is behind it and they've matched and at times even surpassed themselves.  The animation is superb and even more textured this time around, and the 3D - which was dazzling in the first - is even more breath-taking in the flying sequences.  I am not in general a big fan of 3D because so many films do such a poor job of it, but both HTTYD films show just how much can be done with 3D when you have people who really understand its potential and know how to use it doing the film.

Five years have passed since we last saw Berk, and all of our characters are five years older (though not in some cases five years wiser).  The film opens with what has become the new big sport in Berk - dragon racing (which visually is something of a cross between Hogwarts Quidditch and the chariot race from Ben Hur, except with Vikings).  Astrid (America Ferrera) is just as fiercely kick-ass competitive as ever as she and her dragon Stormfly vie with Snotlout (Jonah Hill), Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and the twins Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig) and Tuffnut (T.J. Miller) over live sheep that are used as game balls.  Stoic the Vast(Gerard Butler) and Gobber (Craig Ferguson) cheer them on along with the rest of the village, but Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is nowhere to be seen.  As always, Hiccup is marching (or dragon-riding anyway, with Toothless) to a different drummer, obsessed with exploring and mapping everything that lies beyond the known frontiers of Berk. New seas, new islands, new lands. Always wanting to go further out.  Especially with Stoic increasingly breathing down his neck about assuming his responsibilities as the clan chief heir-apparent, something Hiccup is very ambivalent about.

On one of these exploratory jaunts, Hiccup discovers a mystery.  Or rather several mysteries.  Species of dragons that he's never seen before, strange frozen formations of ice that are clearly not natural, and a mysterious dragon-rider whom he quickly realizes vastly surpasses him in both mastery and knowledge of dragons.  If you've seen the trailers, then you know exactly who this is.  More than that I will not say though as that's a lot of the story that unfolds.

But you can't have a story without conflict, and the new characters bring the conflict on.  Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou), a rival chieftain and ruthless enslaver of dragons, bent on conquest, presents the bigger threat, at least to the Vikings of Berk and their beloved dragons.  But a dragon trapper named Eret (Kit Harington - GoT!) presents an additional threat as far as Snotlout and Fishlegs are concerned. Apparently Berk is short on women in their age demographic, and with Astrid and Hiccup clearly a couple, that leaves only Ruffnut for Snotlout and Fishlegs to fight over and she's clearly not thrilled by either of them. But when the riders confront Eret to find out what Drago is up to, suddenly Ruffnut is very, _very_ interested in this new possibility, much to Snotlout and Fishlegs' chagrin.  And then there's Valka (Cate Blanchett), the mysterious dragon rider Hiccup encounters who has some unfinished business with Stoic. And with Hiccup.

It's the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless though that gives the film both its center and its heart. A lot of the best scenes are simply watching these two interact and seeing how the bond formed in the first film has only deepened over time. A bond, it turns out, that is soon to be deeply tested. And I love the way the animators bring out Toothless's personality, from playful and petulant to curious and courageous. And more interestingly, how they use Toothless's expressions and physicality to show just how much he understands not only Hiccup but humans in general.

On a side note, I also loved the way the animators gave each of the main characters their own physicality, bringing out personality differences in body language, in how they move, even in how they ride their dragons, making each pairing subtly unique. But their most remarkable achievement, at least among the human characters, is Valka. Before she even speaks, simply the way she _moves_ about - at once both graceful and feral - shouts that this is a person who has spent a _lot_ of time around dragons, probably more even than she's spent around humans.

In addition to the returning actors and creative team, HTTYD2 has the same people returning for the music.  John Powell, whose original score for the first film has become one of my absolute favorites (it's also great for working out to, BTW), did the score here as well and did a superb job, adding new themes that reflect the new situations, and Jnsi of the Icelandic band Sigur Rs once again did the songs.

Highly, highly recommended, for anyone who loved the first film, for fans of animation and 3D in general, and for anyone who just feels like having a rollicking fun time.",1400630400,232,5213,4.798882681564246

6185300,5,B00HNH3HIU,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 does many things that are difficult to do in cinema. First is to provide a storyline as great as the original. Here, they have succeeded and even surpassed the rousing, exciting, breathtaking spectacle of the original film. There is no 'sequelitis' going on here. The excitement and edge of your seat feel is present in a visually stunning style, propelling you along for the ride. Here we get to meet Hiccup's mother and also a vigilant foe bent on control of all dragons and the world.

Next, you have to maintain the characters and continue the story of the original in an organic way that doesn't feel 'forced'. Here they succeed as well as Hiccup has matured and so has Toothless his dragon and both must take on challenges as they prepare for the greatness they were destined for. All of it comes together perfectly and is better than most live action movies in terms of characters you care about. Even the soundtrack is sensational. This is the kind of magic that Disney films used to be. The style of animation and artwork certainly helps in the feeling of it's sweeping scope of appeal as well, as it is the most visually  engaging computer animated film I have ever seen.

So if you want a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer and experience wonder, adventure and excitement on a grand scale, You will not be disappointed one bit with How to Train Your Dragon 2. It's not outside the realm of possibility that you too will put it in your list of the top 10 animated films ever created. 5 stars+++++ Most enthusiastically",1512777600,,1563,4.555160142348755

6185305,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Same review for number one. This movie is amazing and it added to the greatness of HTTYD1. Hiccup found his mom so it was also heartwarming. The only sad was that Hiccup gained a parent and then lost one. Nevertheless, the ending was glass shattering. Who would have thought that Toothless could fly blind and deaf?! Or that he had hidden abilities?! I can't decide which movie is better. Oh I know. Neither! I loved both.",1511481600,,422,4.565789473684211

6185330,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Well animated and voiced just as the first movie was. A couple of genuinely funny moments that usually related to the supporting cast. Unfortunately, overall the story was cobbled together forcibly. Of particular note, (spoiler here) the manner in which the story flippantly glosses over the fact that Hiccup's mother is alive, and the seeming ease with which everyone seems to accept this, is jarring. Likewise, the major character death in the story is handled poorly and is all but forgotten by the next scene and the subsequent conclusion. This movie just doesn't measure favorably to the original. Overall, an enjoyable view for the kids for a movie night, adults who actually consider story arc will be less enthralled. Definitely worth a rental, but not a buy.",1503100800,,767,5.047244094488189

6185381,4,B00HNH3HIU,"The sequel to the superior How To Train Your Dragon tells a story that centers on a group of Vikings who come to conquer and control lands through the use of their dragons. This of course puts the denizens of Berk (both reptile and human, who now have a thriving partnership) on a collision course path with the bad guy horde. Hiccup stands front and center as the star again, and he has matured. He is regarded and feels to be himself more a leader, and he makes hard decisions that showcase his growing abilities. Also he discovers why he has such an affinity for and aptitude in connecting with dragons: its inherited and not from his dads side of the family. We are also introduced to a few new dragons including the Bewilderbeast, an awesome alpha dragon who has the ability to subvert all other dragons wills to its own. This puts Berk at a distinct disadvantage and they are reminded why they had originally feared and fought the dragons. The tone of the feature is certainly darker and heavier in themes than the first, which is kinda cool for the younger population who watches this and has grown a bit. The film still manages levity and wonder (the scenes of Hiccup learning from another dragon-speaker that he meets are fun and flighty) but there is the underlying weight of a youth who is transitioning from a young boy to a young man; his decisions carry weight, and some sadness, and not just for himself. HTTYD2 is a worthwhile sequel that embraces the themes of maturation and responsibility. 4.5 stars.",1487203200,,1519,4.608856088560886

The actors are superb, the animation is wonderful, and it is filled with humor adults will enjoy (no raunchy, just not kid humor). I've seen it several times now and I highly recommend it.

Everything else more or less stays the same; there are very few new characters.  The plot involves finding someone nice and someone not so nice.  Hiccup has a crazy notion that you can reason with a bloodthirsty-power-mad dragon hunter...........and finds you cant.  Its an important lesson.",1479600000,,431,4.8493150684931505

6185573,5,B00HNH3HIU,I actually liked Train your Dragon 2 better then the first. There was much more action and introducing the mom in to the movie really makes it easier to understand why Hiccup is the only viking that didn't want to hurt the Dragons. Though I really didn't like the dad getting killed off. I mean the man gets his wife back and BOOM! Gone. Not cool. Over all I highly recommend it.,1471564800,,379,4.277777777777778

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

6185878,5,B00HNH3HIU,"An even bigger and more exciting sequel to the original heartwarming film. At first, I was skeptical of the HTTYD series when it came out since I hadn't been satisfied with anything Disney has produced in the way of animated films lately (and Dreamworks studio has always appeared to play second fiddle to Disney).

On one off night, I took a chance on the first film from a local DVD rental near my home. Then, I watched this sequel on Netflix. Then, I watched both again the next morning. And then, finally, I bought both from Amazon when I had to return the rental later that night. (It was a very impatient two days of waiting for these films to arrive!) HTTYD and HTTYD 2 are some of the best children's movies to see the silver screen in recent years, and the mesmerizing relationship that builds between Hiccup and Toothless brings back feelings of childhood amazement and wonder that you might have forgotten existed. This film is well-scored, well-written, with a great ensemble cast of voice talent and breath-taking animated scenes of flight and action that form a truly incredibly story. I love both films for different reasons, and although the first film has more of a subtle magic to it, this sequel builds on an already-exciting world with great new ideas and even more action and adventure. I love them both equally, and I can't wait for the third one to come to theaters!

If you haven't seen this film before, I MUST recommend that you watch it, and if you have seen it before, then what exactly are you waiting for? Go ahead and add it to your collection! Either way, you will be bringing home a special movie that someone of any age could enjoy.",1454457600,,1666,4.587248322147651

6185995,3,B00HNH3HIU,"The visual effects are just as stunningly amazing, if not more so.  (How do they portray each an ever hair of the father's beard?  How do the clouds look more real than the ones you see out the window when you actually fly?  How do they get the the dragon skin sooooo real?)  You truly feel what it might be like to have flown through the heavens on a dragon.

I think the biggest disappointment of this movie is that the ""hero"", Hiccup, has not seemed to mature or gain any common sense in the five years that we saw him last.  He is whiny, self absorbed and needing constant reassurance.  When both parents do not agree with his pacifism of a mad man, he goes forth with his plan anyhow - twice - and gets a parent killed...only to have the remaining parent give him a ""you tried your best"" speech.  Another thing that really, really, really disappointed (and just plain bugged me) was how the creators through in the obligatory, ""larger than anyone in real life"", dragon-monsters to battle each other out.  Those scenes always make me remember that it is just a fantasy and want to fast-forward through the silly scene.

Oh well, I think it is worth watching to see what the human mind can imagine! The varying dragons are wonderful to watch.",1449878400,3,1245,4.4449339207048455

6186301,4,B00HNH3HIU,"I didn't believe that they could pull off a sequel, though clearly the way the story ended was just begging for one.  I am happy to report just how wrong I was.  This second film to the Dragon series surpasses the scope of the first and matches the heart.  As well as define some of the younger characters a bit more.  If you liked the first film, you will love the second.

SPOILER ALERT:

As a caveat to this, why Hollywood is determined to make all good heroes orphans or members of a single parent family is beyond me.  Oh hey! We found Hiccup's mother!  But we only want one parent so let's kill off Stoic.  Why?  Just so Hiccup can be made chief of Burk?  That was a bit forced.  And why the heck wouldn't it have been a good idea to make Astrid chief?  Not much of a stretch to me.  She'd be a perfect chief.  ok, rant over.",1440979200,,831,4.074534161490683

Toothless & hiccup continue on their journey of friendship & loyalty bring us emotion, strength of character & a truly engaging movie for all ages. I would definitely recommend - the visuals are at times breathtaking for animation.

6186639,3,B00HNH3HIU,"When I finally got around to watching How to Train Your Dragon, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed it.  I didn't love it, but it was fun, so I was definitely interested in seeing the sequel.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, but I finally rented How to Train Your Dragon 2 over the weekend.  Sadly, I didn't find it nearly as much fun.

The story picks up 5 years after the first and life in Berk has greatly changed.  The dragons are now living in the Viking village and are an important every day part of life.  Meanwhile, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) and his dragon Toothless are spending every minute possible exploring the surrounding area to learn what else might be out there.

They are surprised one day to run across a ship that captures dragons.  Even worse is the news that Drago (Djimon Hounsou) is using these captured dragons to build an army to start and win a war.  When Hiccup goes out to trying to find Drago and talk him into peace, he makes an even more startling discovery.  Will his world ever be the same again?

Its been a while since I watched the first movie, so I cant pin point exactly what has changed between the two.  I can say that the preview I saw on another DVD the next night certainly made me glad I hadnt seen it first.  It gave away all the twists of the film except one.

And that twist that they hadnt given away?  It was definitely one thing I didn't like about the film, especially because I didn't feel the payoff was worth it.

Part of that was because the movie was so focused on the story that characters didn't really come alive for me.  Again, maybe if Id seen the first one more times I would have connected with them better.  Honestly, there are only a few that get any significant screen time as it is (not that it helps us connect with them).  The rest of the returning cast have a very small part of the play.

Those supporting characters can be wonderful comic relief, but in this case they were wasted.  They were fine, and frankly I think I would have liked to see more of them.

The plot, which as I already said was the focus of the movie, was a bit rushed as well.  Its almost like they tried to tell too much story for the run time of the film.

Not that the film is bad.  I was entertained while I watched it.  I just wasn't captivated and pulled in, and I certainly don't see a reason to buy it or watch it again.

None of this reflects on the voice cast.  As is usual for a DreamWorks animated film, there are many familiar names, and they all do great jobs bring their characters to life.

And the animation is truly wonderful.  There are some beautiful shots over the course of the film that truly make you appreciate how far computer animation has come.

So How to Train Your Dragon 2 is worth seeing if you were a fan of the first movie.  If you didn't like the first, you can definitely skip this one.  Its an okay movie, but nothing that will thrill anyone but the biggest fans of the original.",1435104000,,2990,4.216931216931217

Overall our entire family enjoyed this movie when we went to see it however made the mistake of viewing it on Father's day.
I never researched it to see what was going to happen because we enjoyed the 1st one so much did not want to spoil it.
The animation of both movies is simply stunning I think that is why we like watching these movies so much.
The story line I do wish some things were different in it but I guess that is why I am not the writer it seems to work the way they did it. Just know if you have sensitive young children and have not yet seen this movie might want to watch it before you let them so you are ready for the sad part and the scary battle scene in it.",1429401600,,707,3.882758620689655

6187097,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Outstanding movie!  Absolutely love the two movies.  This whom he has the best  animation that I have ever seen in any film! Great job team HTTYD 2! They really should have won the Oscar for that alone. I'm not going to do a full review because many have done so before me,and done it much better than I could. There are  A couple of things I'm going to address though.  Contains spoilers

First, I do agree with many that I wish that they would not have killed off Hiccup's Father Stoick. I really loved the idea of he and Valka having a second chance at their marriage. Second, I don't know why people are complaining about this film having a abnormal amount of death in it. Has anyone paid attention to Disney's movies? Like Big Hero 6? In that film, the parents are dead and the brother dies. All of Disney's films are like this. Even the new version of Cinderella. Both the parents die. Usually they just show the father dying in Cinderella,but that's Disney for you. By the way, I did like the  above mentioned films. I'm not bashing them. Just trying to make a point. I didn't like it that Stoick died, I wish he would not have. I just think it's a great film.  I also like the way they show how the kids and the dragons care for each other. It's amazing how they show that genuine emotion between the dragons and the kids. Unfortunately, Kids watch movies that are far worse than How To Train Your Dragon 2. Far more violent with death and many other things kids should not be watching. Anyway, loved the movie and looking forward to the third one",1429228800,,1555,4.356401384083045

 I really liked the original 'How to Train Your Dragon' movie. It was fun, beautiful, and left you with a good feeling at the end.
The sequel came across as kind of preachy, with more than a few holes in the plot line--- but if you like pacifist, conservationist vikings who talk about bringing ""peace to the world"" and the evils of trapping, you might enjoy it.
Mainly, I didn't like the fact that they killed off Stoic. He was one of the best characters. A lot of times, these killing off of favorite fictional characters seems a bit contrived; just a cheap way to manipulate the emotions of the viewers. (""Ooo, look, we killed somebody off, so now it's a serious drama!"")
If I wanted a great tragedy, I would read or watch Hamlet again. I watch kid's films because I want something fun, to cheer me up. This movie was a downer for me and my family.",1428883200,,868,4.391304347826087

I know this is a kid movie (I'm a teenager lol) but this movie, like you cant do that to me in one movie. Once you've watched it you'll understand. It is a great movie, and has a very good plot. I would recommend it to anyone honestly. I love how the character's appearance is ""older"" (if anyone caught that), but you can tell that time has passed. You could tell by Stoic's beard and Hiccup's face and hair. I know it's weird but I just felt satisfied and pleased when I saw this. Very good acting (shows emotions clearly), the music is just on point, and the animation hasn't changed (which is very good because sometimes they change artists and the animation looks different, for example both of the movies of The Hunch Back of Notre Dame's you could tell in the second movie the change of animation). I loved that scene when the song For The Dancing and Dreaming was sung (it was just my favorite tbh) To sum it up, I loved this movie generally, but I'm so upset with the way it plays out like just can you stop (joking)?",1428364800,,1114,4.309523809523809

6187619,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Sequels aren't exactly great especially when they fail to deliver - but this sequel to 'How to Train your Dragon' did not fall into this category. If you're lazy to read some of the longer reviews out there, then here are 3 simple reasons why you should watch this movie.

* Five long years have passed since we last saw Berk and it is a homely and cosy, not to mention unique, environment in which we can all relate to. The first movie was a runaway success, and the characters are lovable and adorable as usual. The plot is intriguing and certainly sheds more light into what looks to be a very profitable and successful movie franchise.

* There are several dimensions to the storyline - the relationship between humans, and the relationship between human and dragon. They bring the catharsis, or the flowing of emotions that is likely to bond this movie to the audience.

* It is a family friendly movie with no alcohol, vulgar scenes involved.",1426118400,,948,4.597633136094674

6187763,5,B00HNH3HIU,"I really enjoyed this movie.  A lot of animated movies have overt moral messages, but not so much here... just a little taste of 'keep an open mind' which I think we call could use from time to time.  This is a great movie just for entertainment value, lots of action, drama, plot-line, it has it all.  I really like the detail in the animation as well, just the right amount of detail without seeming photo-realistic.

The only downside to this movie is that the next one just started production and won't be released until 2018.  I'll be there when it comes out!",1425427200,,564,4.436893203883495

6187790,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Loved it! A rarity, but How To Train Your Dragon 2 was much much funnier than the first. Watching it for the first time when it came out on DVD, i found myself laughing and giggling at how they had some of the characters behaving as it seemed they were hormonal teenagers. Little kids will never catch on of course, but will find their behavior funny as well.",1425427200,,359,4.294117647058823
6187791,2,B00HNH3HIU,"The Good:
- Some halfway decent lessons in leadership
- The dragons are at their best with great, imaginative new characters!
- Great scenes on how to be a man/husband played by Stoick

The Bad
- Terrible plot twist precociously kills off Stoick just when he and his wife reunited and agreed to live again as a family, which would have made a much better story without in any way inhibiting the dastardly-ness and conflict
- Hiccup moves on from his father's death with amazing alacrity (riiiiiight)
- A bad example of how to handle grief on so many levels, it ruins much of the movie's benefit

I was looking forward to this movie, having enjoyed the first one a lot. This movie is a lot like the film ""Marly and Me"" about a golden retriever who kicks the bucket and which becomes such a horrid tear jerker I wanted my money back. Such turns are not appropriate, and they don't serve any higher purpose at all, especially when dealt with so superficially as in this movie.

IF
-If you had put more thought into Hiccup's process, how he could have really suffered from the loss of his father, not just had some light setbacks, it would have enhanced this film a lot and brought out the value of his relationship with his dragon, which you wanted to do
- If you had let Stoick live, we would have had an amazing example of an in-tact family, with a mother and a father, something we need to see a lot more of, and which would have allowed you to develop the relationship of Hiccup with his mother rather than having her be the rah rah cheerleader she finally became

I really hate movies that make me want not so much my money but my time back. Worse, you've robbed us of the potential of a far superior experience.",1425427200,4,1714,4.380503144654088

6187793,5,B00HNH3HIU,I can't say enough good things about this movie! Still not too happy that it didn't win an Oscar but at least it was nominated. Can't wait for the next one!,1425340800,,156,4.064516129032258
6187794,3,B00HNH3HIU,"I don't understand why this movie received such high ratings everywhere ever. I wouldn't even rate it the highest of the animated films released in 2014, and certainly not higher than the first movie in the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy.

I went into this movie expecting some things but left feeling unsatisfied, and even a little pissed off. I didn't have any qualms with the plot, but what I did find problematic were the many thoughtless tropes it was riddled with. It didn't put enough thought into how it treats its female characters and its only character of color.

Without going into detail I'm just going to say that the way they introduced new characters was well done, but the way they handled them was amateur. If you're going to have a female character who's obviously super powerful then she shouldn't just suddenly be weak once the men start playing; if your protagonist character of color (ie. ""other"" in fantasy genre terms) is portrayed the way he is in this movie, then you're doing something wrong (I don't care what he's based off of, why doesn't he act like a human being? -if your answer to that question involves the words ""barbaric"", ""savage"", ""primitive"", ""unthinking"", or something to that effect, then I think that only proves my point).

I'm sorry for the sub-par review (this is only the second time I've ever reviewed anything) but, even though I recommend How to Train Your Dragon 2, I think the people watching it should be conscious of the somewhat tasteless tropes it employs.",1425340800,,1515,4.752851711026616

6187826,1,B00HNH3HIU,"I might have given this movie more stars, had I been able to watch it. Amazon Instant video simply could not play the movie all the way through. Over two days we tried to reboot our systems, restart the movie....and about half way, each time, we would get the ""playback error"" message.

And now, I can't even find a contact number to try and return this movie I paid $5 for, that I couldn't watch. Check out other options available if you want to see the movie. Don't depend on getting what you paid for with Amazon Instant Video.

What a waste.

The characters are interesting and movie is emotionally engaging.  Some of the funniest moments are the brief quips of the supporting characters.  I think that this is an excellent family movie that will be enjoyed by adults as much as children.",1424476800,,390,4.514285714285714
6188041,5,B00HNH3HIU,Great sequel,1424476800,,12,5.5
6188042,5,B00HNH3HIU,"I saw this movie twice last summer and as soon as the movie released on blu ray, I almost immediately went out and purchased the blu ray movie How To Train Your Dragon 2. So why is this movie getting so much acclaim? Lets find out.

A tournament of sorts is being held with dragon riders and their dragons. Stoick takes notice that his son Hiccup and Hiccup's dragon Toothless are missing from all the fun. Astrid later finds Hiccup and he tells her of the pressure he feels due to his coming of age and the expectations placed upon him. They soon meet Eret a dragon trapper when he explains that the dragons aren't for him, but a mysterious man by the name of Drago Bludvist. Later while flying Toothless, Hiccup gets intercepted by another dragon rider who happens to be a woman named Valka and as it turns out, there is more to Valka than meets the eye.

Jay Baruchel voices Hiccup for a second time and does an amazing job in his role. I like the fun-loving relationship he has with Toothless which provides How To Train Your Dragon 2 with some extremely funny, and even some touching moments. Hiccup's bravery makes up for his own uncertainty, and alongside Toothless they keep this movie on the right track. Gerard Butler also returns voicing Stoick the leader of the Vikings and does a very good job. Cate Blanchett does really well in her role as Valka; she has great chemistry alongside Baruchel's Hiccup and Butler's Stoick. And you have to admire her passion for the dragons. Djimon Hounsou stars as the villain Drago Bludvist and does a really nice job.

I feel the story in How To Train Your Dragon 2 is significantly better than the first movie. There is a lot of humor, but I love how How To Train Your Dragon 2 pays attention to detail very well. It doesn't leave one scene hanging, nor does it ever feel like too much is being done at once. And that being said, How To Train Your Dragon 2 does have some emotional moments (yes I did cry) that make the movie even better. Animation wise, How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a gorgeous feat to watch. Every detail, whether its the dragons, Hiccup's facial expressions, or even the scenes involving ice, is definitely beautiful to see. And if reassurance was ever needed, then I would say that How To Train Your Dragon 2 succeeds Perfectly due to the spectacular animation, the pace and detail of the story, the well done voice acting, and because dragons are so much fun!

I enjoy this movie each time I watch and I definitely can not wait to see it again. I will be keeping a close eye on tomorrow's Oscars (mainly because I want to see which movie will win Best Animated Feature). The audience will have to be patient for the 3rd sequel but in the meantime enjoy How To Train Your Dragon 2 to the fullest because it is indeed

A GREAT Experience

6188289,5,B00HNH3HIU,"I think I'll spare the typical ""sequels are inferior"" blurb and get straight to the point.  ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" is not only the rare sequel that may exceed the standard set by its wonderful predecessor, but it is also the even rarer type that actually feels necessary.  Director Dean DeBlois, modeling after such excellent sequels like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (as if that comparison hasn't been made enough), expands the story line not by merely advancing the ages of the characters, but by advancing the tone.  This is, to be sure, a darker chapter in a proposed trilogy of films that explores the coming-of-age tale of Hiccup, as he explores the kindness of the once reviled dragon species, gains respect from his Viking tribe by showcasing how gentle these creatures are, and now tries to find the confidence within himself to explore the responsibilities that he must face as a proposed chief of his tribe.

""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" has the human touch, not unlike the one given to the first.  A major plot development, which could have very well been executed for the sake of taking up sequel space, is instead executed with grace and compassion.  Indeed, it is a testament to the filmmakers that these animated characters are treated like actual human beings.  A scene occurring rather early in the film features a sense of authenticity hard to come by in animation these days.  Hiccup and Astrid are given the time to pleasantly interact and joke with each other.  Another scene showcases a heartfelt reunion between two characters who have spent years apart from each other.  Alas, when Hiccup reunites with his long gone mother, it is the set up for scenes that are at once visually enticing and emotionally satisfying.

Speaking of the visuals, the improved technology used for the film is on full display.  The sight of dragons flying through the air is absolutely stunning.  When dramatic encounters between characters occur in the foreground, it is hard to look away from the background.  I doubt you needed to see this in 3D to get the idea.

All of these factors help to overshadow the obviously more formulaic bits of the film.  To be fair, Drago, the film's villain, is nothing more than the stereotypical ""out to take over the world"" type.  Nevertheless, his motives are well placed in the story, where he effectively serves as the yin to Hiccup's yang (hate to borrow a cliche, but there you go).

And lest we forget the brilliance showcased in the performers.  Jay Baruchel is still rightfully in place as the voice of Hiccup, and his supporting actors still do excellent work.  Plus, what else is there to say about Gerard Butler's work as Stoick that hasn't already been said?  And Cate Blanchett's addition to the cast is brilliant to say the least.  The work from Djimon Hounsou as Drago is also brilliant, and it is fun seeing (or rather, hearing) Kit Harrington, whose ""appearance"" gives way to a very sly and witty reference to his ""Game of Thrones"" character Jon Snow.

The confidence demonstrated here is simply hard to ignore.  As far as sequels are concerned, ""HTTYD 2"" has the ability to be considered on its own terms as well.  This is a wondrous achievement, and exceptional all around.",1423872000,,3235,4.775179856115108

It's as if the sequel and the first movie were cousins rather than siblings but the amazing power of the story in this movie completely lived up to the more serious themes.

When Hiccup and his pals try to find Drago, to barter peace instead of war, Hiccup instead finds himself and Toothless taken by a mysterious figure wearing a mask ... his friends soon in the clutches of Drago himself.

We were so excited to watch the new one in the theater.  I had to walk out of the theater with a crying 6 year old (thankfully I didn't take 4 year old).  This story is dark and frightening.

It's a great story to be sure, but the movie strays in many ways from the books.

How to Train Your Dragon 2

by Dreamworks Studios

****

Note: The Worm has not seen the first How to Train Your Dragon Movie nor has he read the original books, so this film will be judged on a stand alone basis.

The Story: How to Train Your Dragon 2 continues the adventures of the Hiccup the Viking and his Night Fury Dragon, Toothless. Five years have passed since the last film and now dragons and Vikings live and work together on the island of Berk. Hiccup and Toothless are now exploring the regions beyond their island home, but a dark villain is hunting the dragons and poses grave threat to Hiccup and his home.

The Good: Dreamworks, once upon a time, was merely considered to be the awkward step-brother compared to Pixar but in recent years it has really come into its own as animation powerhouse. HTTYD 2 is proof of this: The animation is absolutely superb.

A common criticism of early computer generated animations was the depictions of humans and sometimes animals. The technology had not yet reached a point where they could be rendered effectively, and they ran into uncanny valley scenarios. The uncanny valley is a phenomena where the closer something resembles a human, instead of becoming attractive, it appears creepy and unnatural. Indeed, the humans depicted in Toy Story looked flat and dead eyed and the toys looked more lifelike. In later CG films, the move was made to make human characters more cartoonish than realistic, so they would be more appealing. HTTYD2 pulls this off very well with both the human as well as the dragon characters. They all look good and have a lot of personality. The environments are where the animators skill really show. The sea and the clouds, and the more intimate settings are as colorful and realistic as the characters and also have a lot of personality.

Overall this film is big. The setting is just gigantic. The stunning vistas, the giant monsters, the film is epic in scale. It was with it to see the film in the theatre. If it is ever rereleased on the big screen, viewers should definitely take the chance. That same has been said for the first film as well.

Even though he never says a word, Toothless has a ton of personality, by his expressions and body language alone. The heart of this movie is the relationship between Toothless and Hiccup. It is incredibly clear that they care deeply for one another and their bond goes far deeper than that of simply Master and Pet. Perhaps a good plot element for the third film will be how to work out the relationships between Toothless, Hiccup and Astrid, as they are both loved by Hiccup.

On a final note: the movies theme song, Jonsis Where No One Goes, is absolutely perfect. When Hiccup and Toothless are soaring across the sea and through the clouds, it just perfectly matches the feeling of wonder and the excitement. It makes anyone who sees yearn to fly through the air on a pair of wings.

The Flaws: The designs of the dragons are very hit and miss. Some like Toothless and the Bewilderbeast are cool, some like the ones the minor characters fly are just ugly and some would go as far to say too cartoony for their own good.

Some plot elements are really unnecessary. The love triangle among some of hiccups friends is quite tiring at times and just annoying. Some of the characters too are kind of annoying and the fact that Reelworm cannot recall their names should be proof enough over how he doesn't really care for them.

Final Verdict:

Five out of Five Stars

6188554,5,B00HNH3HIU,"5 years ago I reluctantly went to see the original ""How To Train Your Dragon"" and ended up thinking it was one of the best movies of the year.  So now, again I reluctantly take a look at the sequel.  Reluctant because, well...it's a sequel.  Fortunately, just like the first time, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only is this a terrific sequel that builds on the original, but I think the animation is even better as well.

All the original characters are back and yes they are all 5 years older including our hero, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel).  His father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), the Viking tribe leader wants Hiccup to take a more active leadership role as the heir apparent.  But Hiccup is too busy enjoying the high flying fun with his dragon-friend, Toothless.  While out having a good time with Astrid (America Ferrera), his girlfriend/wife (I swear I heard Stoick call her his daughter-in-law, but I could be wrong), they come upon a strange ice formation coming from the ocean.  Investigating, they are temporarily imprisoned by a dragon trapper named Eret (Kit Harrington).  They quickly escape but Eret tells them that an evil doer named Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) is collecting all of the dragons in the area.

When Hiccup tells his father about this, the name is recognized from a past confrontation.  Stoick prepares for war in order to protect his tribe and their dragons.  Hiccup believes that a peaceful solution can be found and against his father's orders, sneaks away to find Drago, with Astrid right behind.  They discover another surprise in the form of a hidden world of dragons in a refuge run by a woman-warrior named Valka (Cate Blanchett).  It doesn't take long for the pair to realize there is a connection between them that goes beyond protecting dragons.

The final act develops into a fierce battle of supremacy between Stoick, Hiccup and their new ally, Valka and the menacing Drago and his mind controlled dragons.  Alas, a peaceful solution is not at hand and Hiccup and Toothless must work together to prevail.  In addition to some humorous moments, mostly supplied by Craig Ferguson as Gobber, Jonah Hill as Snotlout and Kristen Wiig as Ruffnut, the film has some great action sequences and some emotional moments that might cause a few tears to be wiped away.  This is my kind of family entertainment.

If the story by Dean DeBlois who also directed, isn't enough, this is one of the best looking Blu ray discs I've seen.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The colors are impeccable and there are plenty of them as you might expect.  The detail is sharp and the contrast is exemplary.  Black levels are perfect and consistent throughout the film.  This is an incredibly beautiful looking movie.  The Blu ray also features a stunning DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 track.  Right out of the gate, the sound swirls around the room as Hiccup and Toothless soar among the clouds.  All surround and LFE (.1) channels will get a workout.  This is a wonderfully immersive film, with the sound equal to the video experience.  Subtitles are numerous including English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Hindi, Indonesian, Malay, Tamil, Teluga (huh?), Thai and Vietnamese.  Here are the extras:

*Dawn of the Dragon Racers (1080p; 26:37)

This movie was such a huge disappointment that my kids refuse to watch any of the franchise anymore at all. There was so much potential for making this such an amazing film with even more movies to come. Killing off such a huge key character was simply horrible. Utterly pointless. His death did nothing to spur the story into new directions and really only dead ended so many other possibilities. This is a movie designed for family viewing. What on earth is a child going to learn or enjoy about such a senseless death in a cartoon?! We did not see this coming and I did not feel it was necessary to screen the movie before I let my kids watch it, everything else they have made has been exceptional. My mistake.

We saw it in the summer and they enjoyed it, and opening it on Christmas morning produced more squeals of joy than anything else.  The quality of the animation is a noticeable step up from the first movie and other Dreamworks films.  The voice acting is well done, and the story is not your typical children's part 2 film.  Though the issue of a main character's death was difficult for the children to accept, it shows that this is not your generic ""sell toys"" kind of movie.

6188652,5,B00HNH3HIU,2014 was an amazing year for movies of all types. There were too many high points to pick a definitive favorite this year and HTTYD 2 was definitely one of these high points. I don't want to say too much about my reactions to the movie because I feel that might be spoilery. But If you enjoyed the first part and lets be honest who didn't? Then you will absolutely love this one. Its bigger more epic and tons of fun. Great for the kids and for the adults.,1421798400,,456,4.134831460674158

6188740,2,B00HNH3HIU,"Dragons as cute as Webkinz toys soar to steal the show from humans as one-dimensional as, well, cartoon characters. If the first film soared, this one merely bumps along, flat-footed and dreary. I think I will pass on the third one.",1421452800,,232,4.682926829268292
6188741,4,B00HNH3HIU,"In this sequel to the 2010 smash hit, Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home to even more dragons and come face to face with a villain who is amassing a dragon army. This time around, as is typical with sequels, they up the ante and the stakes are raised. There's even more dragons and not only that, but there's also a greater variety. But more importantly, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 has the same charm and heart that made the first one so enjoyable in the first place. We get a deeper look at Hiccup's relationship with his father, and he also meets and bonds with his long-lost mother who turns out to be a kindred spirit. All of the supporting cast is back, too, and funny as ever. My favorite running gag was Astrid continually being smitten by a dragon trapper, Eret (voiced by Kit Harington). Sadly, though, the villain was rather weak in terms of motivation and his actual presence in the film. He wasn't introduced properly until about halfway through, and the way in which he was defeated was a bit cheesy, making him seem like somewhat of a pushover compared to the villain in the last one. However, despite the weakness of the central conflict, there are some resonant themes which are explored. The primary one, and one which has been done before in other films, is that of finding your true self. Hiccup is torn between his father naming him as his successor and living a free life with the dragons like his mother. More relevant to the central conflict is the struggle for peace when those opposed to you have their minds set on war. Hiccup remains an idealist for much of the running time, but ultimately discovers that occasionally you do have to fight for what you believe is right. Both of these messages should appeal to the demographic this movie is aimed at, especially the first one. The film also takes a rather poignant turn in the third act (which I will not spoil) that should have people reaching for their handkerchiefs. Overall, this sequel, while not quite living up to its predecessor in terms of the central conflict, is still a rollicking, fun time for kids and adults alike. If you saw and liked the first one, there's not a reason I can think of that you wouldn't feel the same here.",1421452800,,2236,4.509852216748769
6188742,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Wondered if it was going to be a let down, but was pleasantly surprised.  The story was interesting, especially with the roller-coaster of emotions concerning the discovery Hiccup's mother, his parents' reunion and the loss of his father.  There was also the good vs. evil aspect - that Hiccup was determined to stop war proactively, but found his mother and father were right when they said there was no talking with the villain, because war is what he wanted.  This was a hard, but necessary lesson for Hiccup, especially when he succeeded his father as leader. So, we see the lad's rise in maturity and status.  All in all, it was an excellent follow up of the first movie.",1421366400,,676,4.65546218487395

SPOILER ALERT - do not continue reading if you have not seen the movie.  Here's my beef:  Hiccup finds his mom, and she and his dad are still in love and then BAM, the alpha dragon takes over Toothless and he kills Hiccup's dad.  This was so totally unnecessary.  I couldn't believe they had Toothless KILL the dad!  Yeah, kids should know life is hard, but this is unusually harsh to have a beloved pet and friend kill a parent (albeit under the control of another dragon).  But what is that even teaching kids?  I don't see any worthy lesson here to justify the unnecessary death.  Hugely disappointed in that plot point.",1421280000,2,759,4.467153284671533

6189054,5,B00HNH3HIU,This is a great family movie.  I loved seeing what happens next in the lives of the dwellers of Burk.  Without giving too much away for the few of you who may not have seen it yet; Hiccup really comes into his own and finds something he never expected to find.,1420588800,,260,4.078431372549019
6189055,4,B00HNH3HIU,"It's a pretty good movie with some real emotional elements to it, but at times it can be a bit too heavy for young children. I bought this for my 5 year old nephew, and there were some pretty dark scenes about death in the movie that didn't seem appropriate for young kids. Maybe for 10 year olds, but even then it was still pretty morbid.",1420588800,,339,4.151515151515151

6189063,3,B00HNH3HIU,"The quality of the animation is fine. I found the story line uninspired. Definitely not as touching and endearing as the first one.  And the movie took on the flavor of all live action movies these days - which I don't care for - where there are NON-STOP chase scenes/warring/combats from start to finish. I wish I would have waited and rented this on cable first, as I would have known not to purchase it for our collection, which are movies we want to watch multiple times.  This one I don't feel compelled to watch again.",1420588800,,524,4.447916666666667

6189150,5,B00HNH3HIU,"If you're a fan of the 1st movie, you're going to love the 2nd movie! It's pretty rare when a sequel is as good or better than the original. How to Train Your Dragon 2 meets or exceeds its predecessor.

My only critique of the movie, if you want to call it that, it may not be appropriate for very small children. It is darker than the original. More geared toward adults or older children. The protagonist (Hiccup) has to face more adult situations such as the loss of a loved one or over-humanizing pets (dragons), and the realization that they are animals and can hurt you.

Overall, I had the same feeling with this movie as I did Toy Story 3. That movie definitely made you feel like a kid again but also darker and perhaps might scare small children.",1420416000,,756,4.3546099290780145
6189151,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Great movie! Nice story. Kept our 2 and 4 year old daughters' attention for the entire movie. It had a few ""scary"" parts but they didn't bother our girls much. The dragons were colorful and ""cute"" so the girls really liked them.",1420416000,,228,4.4523809523809526

Some really touching moments here and some good character development (and some minor issues with characters there added for juvenile comic relief that seems to not work)..... but with all things, you all know someone who'd act like that in a crisis anyway..... :)

Still, I felt tears coming to my eyes in the second half of the movie and just the character of Toothless..... wow.....  If you thought the first one was good, this one was lightyears better than that one despite its minor flaws with some childish bits of humor... after all, it also is a kids film.  :)",1420243200,,626,4.654545454545454

Not that it was boring or uninteresting, perhaps a bit too much dialogue in places for a children's animated movie. I enjoyed the movie but was looking for more goofiness and action, such as was present in the first movie.

The story line about the mother was good. I enjoyed the genuineness of the overwhelmed and confused mother. I'm a mother myself. Of course, it's just a children's movie, but I did like that plot line.",1419638400,,579,4.3119266055045875

Definitely a must buy, the video was pristine and crisp, we will watch this multiple times.
Yes - I agree the LFE was nothing like the 1st one, oh well can't gripe more than what others have already done.

6189667,5,B00HNH3HIU,"How To Train Your Dragon was a movie I never would have expected from DreamWorks. Known for being anti-Disney, they provided us such a dramatic and heartfelt film. When the sequel hit theaters I was only hoping to see a bigger and better film...and number 2 delivered.

The story of Berk is bigger and there is so much riding on Hiccup and Toothless as a villain from the past returns to conquer all with an army of dragons. A chance encounter with a mysterious person from Hiccup's past gives him the encouragement and strength he needs to rise up and be a hero to his people. The film gives us incredible animation great humor and additional voices including Cate Blanchett, Djimon Hounsou and an unexpected Kit Harrington. There is plenty more that is very unexpected that adds to the story and the legacy of these films that will surprise you.

I am very excited to see what is in store, now that DreamWorks has announced a third installment in the works. How to Train Your Dragon 2 suprpases its predicessor in all areas and it is one if not the best animated film of 2014.",1419379200,2,1078,4.523076923076923

I would recommend it to any parents for their children as this movie, as well as the series, provides good moral messages - that maybe adults should pay attention to as well.

6189702,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Animated movies for children are often viewed as somewhere in between a nuisance and neccessity.  I normally do not like animation sequels because if you have ever followed Disney sequels like Cinderella 2 and others, you would know that it normally is straight to DVD and not really worth sitting down with your children to watch.

Dreamworkds somehow have found how to elevate animated sequels to a very respectable level.  How To Train Your Dragon 2 surpassed its predecessor and found a way to have its main characters grow up with its audience and somehow keep its appeal to introduce itself to a younger audience too.

Hiccup and Toothless' adventure into finding themselves, individually and as a team, really taught a lesson on the importance of having the right influence surround you when you are most impressionable.  They both come out stronger and braver by the time the last big fight was over.

It is a must watch for kids and parents.  There are more than enough ""talking points"" if a parent pays enough attention to it.",1419292800,,1036,4.8192090395480225

I watched it with my boyfriend who also enjoyed the movie - and he's NOTORIOUSLY picky. While some of the twists in the film he saw coming, I was surprised (when watching childrens films, I don't try and figure out what's going to happen).

I'd say this was a movie that was appropriate for children and families - it deals well with loss, and well-loved characters growing up and finding their own way.",1419206400,,535,4.35

It is a more young adult take on the story so teens and parents would both like it. Kids will like it too for the cool dragons but some things may be over their head which makes it an all ages movie. I could watch this one many times and not get sick of it.

The dialogue was bland and the jokes seemed forced. The emotional moments lacked any impact. The animation seemed off too, like the characters' movements during dialogue was choppy and unnatural. Maybe it has something to do with it being animated for 3d and watching in 2d. The first movie didn't have this issue.

IMHO the story in the first movie was way better. And probably what really affected my view of the movie is this: the ending in the second movie was not exactly a happy one (I will not say why because that would be a major spoiler). And it appears that they set things up for version 3.

6189805,5,B00HNH3HIU,"A lot of people who saw this before I did said that it was better than the first movie; while I didn't find that exactly, I do feel like it's a fantastic sequel, with a great story, plenty of exciting moments, lots of surprises, and many emotional moments. Plus there are TONS of dragons!! I like how Hiccup is five years older, and he even has a cool light sabre that spits flammable gas!! But it's a gimmick - only shows up in the first part of the movie...

One thing it might have done better at is developing the minor characters - that's what we loved about the first film, and it was a bit lacking in this one. Oh well!

Also, the new film also doesn't manage to explain just how it is that the older generations of Vikings speak English with Scottish accents, while the younger dragonlords speak with American accents... oh well again!!

The DVD comes with a few extras - there's a 12-minute feature on ""Fishlegs' Dragon Stats"", and a gallery of 32 sketches, showing Roger Dean-like depictions of dragon land (many of these are shown in the closing credits). Nice!!!",1418860800,,1074,4.469387755102041
6189806,4,B00HNH3HIU,"How To Train Your Dragon 2 is even more impressive in the animation than the previous film was. The scenes with dragons flying are amazingly epic. If the story is probably a bit plain and classic, with the return of the mother, it has its dramatic moments that make it very entertaining and quite powerful. The evil guy is quite convincing, the heroes take real responsabilities.",1418860800,,379,4.757575757575758

6189814,2,B00HNH3HIU,"I recently watched How to Train Your Dragon 2 with my wife and I found it disturbing. Not because it wasn't a good story, but rather because I find the level of violence in some of the scenes inappropriate for small children. For this reason Im deducting stars.

I found the killing of the elder dragon to be bad enough, but the murder of Hiccups father  in front of him - COMPLETELY unacceptable! What are the writers thinking putting this kind of material in a show being viewed by young children?  SHAME on you, Disney!

I have read several articles written by concerned parents on the violence displayed in many of Disneys shows, but never thought too much on it  until now.  Even my wife was disturbed by these scenes. But killing Hiccups father in front of him crosses a line and I now find myself questioning Disneys choices. If the writers want to put this type of violence in movies, then write them for adult themes - not children.  And where were the producers?  Who approved these scenes?!  An alternative end could have been easily incorporated with little effort. There is no excuse for this.

Apparently Walt Disney movies have reached a point where responsible parents will have to view them first before making the decision to allow their children to see them.  What a shame. I think its time we need to re-evaluate Disney.",1418774400,2,1340,4.635593220338983
6189815,4,B00HNH3HIU,"I did not have a chance to see this in theaters, so needless to say, I was quite excited to finally view it on Amazon Instant Video!

Overall, it was a great film just like its predecessor in the sense that the special effects, music, and dialogue was amazing. The only thing I missed was the little, funloving Hiccup and his forming relationship with Toothless. While they have a relationship in this one (no spoilers, but the end fight scene with them together was heartwarming!), it was in a different way since they both have matured and times are changing. But that is coming of age, so besides my wistfulness for things ago, I was not disappointed in this second installment. I am curious as to what awaits Berk in the next one...",1418774400,,736,4.533834586466165

6189938,4,B00HNH3HIU,"In HTTYD2, Hiccup and Toothless discover an ice cave that is home to hundreds of new wild dragons and the mysterious dragon rider, but at the same time find themselves at the center of a battle to protect the peace.

To me, How to Train your Dragon was one of the great surprises in animated movies when it came out 4 years ago.  It had a fantastic story, great animation and was entertaining and fun for both kids and adults.  So I was really interested in seeing the sequel coming out some 4 years later.

Like the original, the animation is great and well done.  The scenes are beautifully crafted and detailed.  The acting is just as strong as the first as all of the major characters from the first are back and the story is also well done with a fantastically weaved tale.  I would say though that this sequel is not as light and humorous as the first and has a bit of a darker tone especially with the entry of the villain in the movie.  But even with the darker tone, the villain Drago, played by Djimon Hounsou, gave me chills as he was so well played and the story has some surprises and isn't as formulaic as a lot of movies tend to be, especially sequels.

I original was a surprise to me and a great film and this sequel stands as its own as a good movie as well.  Entertaining for us adults and kids as well.

6189965,2,B00HNH3HIU,"Even when the animation was a bit dark at times...the visuals were great, and maybe even better than the first film.  Unfortunately, the animation was connected to a mish-mash of boring subplots. The scenes just dragged on and on and what plot was present was edited unevenly, resulting in fantastic animation which had no purpose, or direction.  Synopsis spoilers: the boy grows older...he falls in love...finds his long lost mother then his dad is killed...so he beats up the killers.  The producers only needed 15 minutes to tell that kind of story. I want to know who suggested the father should be killed and cremated.  The dad was the best character in the story.  He embellished what it takes to be a good leader and a good father.  For the producers to make the scranny, ""chalk-scraping-on-a-blackboard-voice-boy"" the chief just because he had the top dragon was almost as ridiculous as the reason they gave for the mother taking off and deserting her son...so laughable it was sad.  Changing what makes a character interesting is always a risk and because they tried to change everything about the boy that made him interesting and endearing...the story failed miserably.  Parents this is what Hollywood is trying to teach your children:  Youth over seniority, and when times get tough...parents are allowed to walk away.",1418256000,4,1330,5.009090909090909

6189988,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Spoilers alert.  Saw the movie in theaters and loved it.  Got the 3D version on Blu-Ray as I finally have a 3D HDTV.  Enjoyed it immensely at home.  Liked the introduction of Hiccup's mother, will miss his father due to the character's death in the film.  Like a number of others, I felt in the theater that Astrid could have been given a bigger role.  Didn't notice that feeling so much watching the Blu-Ray (probably because of familiarity).  Virtually all of the characters in the movie and in the TV series spin-off have had the same actors voicing the roles, which helps.  Many of the better 3D blu-rays are the various animated movies :-)  Despite the poo-poohing of some in the media, I think that 3D will be around.  3D will not make a bad movie a good one, but 3D adds an enjoyable element to a good movie.  I don't have experience with any of the automated 2D>3D systems but I doubt that they can do any sort of particularly good job.",1418169600,,944,4.398843930635838

6190061,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Disappointing.  I loved the first Dragon movie, and had high hopes for this sequel.  It was beautifully done, but the plot wasn't nearly as good.  Was it really necessary to kill off a main character?  Don't think the kids will like that.  All in all, it felt more like a video game than a sequel to a wonderful movie.",1417996800,5,318,4.322033898305085
6190062,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Really enjoyed this sequel. Hiccup is now an adult and the story focuses on his reluctance to become chief. Lots of dragons. Lots of action. Some of the scenes might be a little scary for younger viewers. A little frustrated that it was $10 every where else for Black Friday, but I can't complain because I had the video the day it came out.",1417996800,,341,4.34375

6190064,3,B00HNH3HIU,"I'm not a movie critic or a movie snob, this movie started out well, unfortunately it quickly went from good, to bad, to worse and was far below my standard for a sequel that I would consider to be worthwhile.  It always irritates me when studios put out sequels just because it's easy money.  If you ask me there has to be a compelling reason to do a sequel and that reason should be that you know you can make something that measures up to the first movie.  ok, end of rant...I'm sure kids will still thoroughly enjoy this movie or I would have given it a much lower rating.",1417996800,,576,4.218181818181818

6190073,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Beautiful animation that apparently required extensively spying on my cat to create Toothless, but colossally grim story line.  Also, even though these people are all ostensibly Vikings, the villain looked black, which seems more than a little troubling.

6190092,4,B00HNH3HIU,"While not as good as the original film, this remains the best animated movie I saw in 2014. It takes the story and characters in some fresh directions, expands their imaginary world, and keeps things interesting.

The animation was very well done, again, though I wasn't all that impressed with the 3D features I saw in the theater. I would prefer the normal version of the film over the 3D version, so if that is something you are genuinely thinkng about, keep in mind that the 3D effects are nothing special.

I considered the first HTTYD movie a ""must buy."" I don't know that I would say the same of this second installment, but it is still very enjoyable, and I'm sure it will be on many, many kids' Christmas wish lists for the 2014 holiday season.",1417910400,,753,4.489051094890511

6190119,3,B00HNH3HIU,"While the movie itself is pretty amazing looking, I never felt there was any real plot that moved the story along. Certain aspects of the story line felt forced or convenient in order to allow other things to take place later on. The movie also suffers from the inability to pick whether it is a serious war story or a ridiculous comedy. Ultimately it just felt kind of flat and odd.

It was fun to see toothless again, and that snow was near perfect, but if you're looking for the same level and impact as the first movie you may be disappointed.",1417824000,,547,4.362745098039215

LOL We had a nice dinner out, then came home to eat dessert and watch this movie...very quiet, but it was the best birthday I've ever had.  This movie left all of us (2 adults and 2 kids) feeling happy and downright exhilarated.  The kids were so excited and zooming around the living room and I didn't have the heart to tell them to knock it off because I totally understood.  :-)  My husband loved this movie too, and he hardly EVER likes ""kid movies.""",1417737600,,740,4.470149253731344

6190173,3,B00HNH3HIU,The first one was of course much better than their sequel. It seemed to take a far stretch. Dragged the story out to far. Was to much like a disney movie which I didn't expect from dreamworks.  But was a beautiful movie. Lots of colors and wonderfully drawn. Just lacked in story telling.,1417564800,,288,4.433962264150943

Having to conserve funds (and who doesn't?) adding to the difficulties getting around, we had to wait for the DVD movie to be released before we could see it--definitely worth the wait!  Thank you to the cast and crew for such great and wonderfully entertaining movies!  The fun and magic of the first one are definitely continued in the second!

6190214,3,B00HNH3HIU,"as with most sequels, it is very hard to top the original because the story line (characters, setting, plot devices) are already known - so a big element of surprise/discovery is gone ... getting the backstory on Hiccup's mother-in-absence and upbringing was enlightening but for me, the pacifist anti-hero personna of the main character (Hiccup) is starting to wear pretty thin and is not very believable -- such characters are NOT the guys that win the day when the chips are down and get the girl, regardless of what they seem to want you to believe ... ... it is an ok way to while away a couple of hours i guess, but i did not find it to be that satisfying ... blue sky & rainbows story writing is just too light ...",1417392000,2,721,4.388059701492537

6190219,3,B00HNH3HIU,We enjoyed How to train your dragon one so much we could hardly wait for two.  We rented one thinking it was a kids movie with good music and a reasonable story.  We were surprised to find the original movie was much more adult oriented.  The sequel was heavily geared towards children.  Every second the characters were flying on their dragons and crashing into some easily avoidable object.  Children will love this movie.  Since I am no longer one and I do not have any of my own the movie was rather disappointing.  The music was still good though.,1417392000,2,552,4.515151515151516

The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of some unnecessary personal preferences put in the movie that had nothing to do with the story.

The content is quite enjoyable and we loved seeing the advances in animation that CG is rendering these days.
Streaming delivery was exceptionally weak.  Likely due to the comcast-conglom that serves as little as possible for our monthly payment.  I imagine that comcast has it out for the likes of Amazon and Hulu and they work to make streaming from these providers as painful as possible.

I absolutely loved the first movie and based on the reviews was really looking forward to seeing this one. The animation is amazing! The story starts off with humor but quickly becomes much darker than the first one and eventually morphs into a Greek tragedy! Hiccup finds his mother who has been presumed dead and later Stoic and his long lost wife are reunited, pledge to be a family again and almost immediately after.... Stoic is killed by Toothless while protecting Hiccup! Toothless is at the time under mind control by an Alpha Dragon whose master is the movie's villain, however this is too much for a lot of kids under 14 and frankly ruins the rest of the film!  If you have young children I would not allow them to watch this movie!",1417392000,6,767,4.639705882352941

I think the 2 movies will be part of our Holiday good cheer movies. We also have several other animated movies that are fun. So I can learn a new trick! (OK I'm not saying I'm an old dog! LoL).

Is it Toothless' story? Hiccups? Stoicks? The mothers? The dragon hunters? It just seems to say, ""This happened, then this happened."" The kids weren't grabbed by it either the way that they were with the first one. After the first one, they were acting like Vikings and asking a lot of questions about Vikings.

6190316,1,B00HNH3HIU,What were they thinking??!!  The first Dragon movie was uplifting and positive. Dragon 2 was far too dark for children leaving my 7 and 9 year old in tears!!!  The themes were far too adult and there was no reason to have such a graphic portrayal of the loss of a loved one!!! I cannot recommend this for children under 12 years of age.

6190333,5,B00HNH3HIU,I have loved dragons since I was a child.  I read anything I can about them; fact and fiction; and this is one of the best sequels I have ever seen.

I found this Train your Dragon 2 was just as good (if not even better) than the first one. Jay Baruhcel did something that I found very amusing: the antics going on behind the scene, like when Hiccup was explaining something and Toothless was being swamped by the baby dragons was hilarious! There was something going on all over the whole screen! The detail and the activity of each character constantly doing something at the same time all over the screen will definitely make you want to watch it again and again. And the addition of a new super Dragon (thats all I'm going to say about it so I won't spoil it for you) is awesome to say the least. The first How to train your Dragon, was a such a hit, that it inspired spin off cartoons -it was THAT good...and now I think we are just going to see more and more of the young man and his Dragon friend!

6190406,5,B00HNH3HIU,"The second film in this very well made series made me very sad.  With the demise of Stoic the Vast, Hiccup is entering uncharted territory.  He is going to be forced to assume more responsibility in his village.  Something he has been quite understandably resisted.  His second shock is the reentry of his mother into his life.  This opens up Hiccups view of his world, especially when she shows him all the other dragons.  The war with Drago was unmanted, but very necessary. Hiccup now has a new mentor, his mother  Valka.  With her agreement to accompany Hiccup back to Berk, the scene is set for the series finale.  This film is very moving, and I recommend it anyone who enjoys fine animated features.

DREAM WORKS is now a part of DISNEY so I shouldn't be surprised that they would go for an armature heart breaking drama  rather than an ingenious, creative and savvy tale.  I loved how Dream Works knew how to bring you to the brink of disaster, leave you hanging on a thread of hope, then pull you up with a creative twist that left you laughing and feeling uplifted and happy!

6190618,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Only a few companies can make a sequel just as good, or better than, the original. This is one of those movies.  It helps to have watched the original to know the back story but anyone will enjoy this if they haven't.  This story is appropriate in that it is five years after the original.  All of the characters reflect that and the actors portraying feed it.  They are relaxed, know their character, and make the story shine just a bit more than it already does.  Toothless is the best, by far, in his voiceless expressions of anger, annoyance, and fear.  The animators have platinum with him.  This movie also deals with loss, fear, loyalty, and betrayal and provides a positive approach to those things that otherwise might make one retaliate.

6190678,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Cute enough, but they flopped on the message of kindness and cleverness at the end.

Was Hiccup justified in fighting back? Of course. But did the resolution was lazy, in my mind, to a degree that undermined so much of Hiccup's message for peace. There's no reason they couldn't have had Hiccup cleverly and kindly win over the alpha dragon instead of having Toothless dominate it with superior willpower. Then the message would have ended up on a note of, ""How you fight for what's right is just as important as fighting for it in the first place,"" which is a message I can get behind. They could very well have implied that, stripped of the ability to use his dragons as weapons, Drago could be reformed to be at least grudgingly content with the community...which would leave the opening for a very cute short of a baby dragon attaching itself to him and being so relentlessly affectionate and adorable that he can't help but start to come around to the idea that dragons can be friends.

As it stood, the final message was ""the way to enforce peace is through superior firepower"" and that kept the movie from being one I would either buy outright or bother watching twice.",1416441600,,1176,4.595238095238095

6190710,1,B00HNH3HIU,"Too dark for me.  If I'd known what they were going to do, I wouldn't have bought it. And now I don't even want to watch the cartoon or the first movie anymore, knowing how they intend to end things...just sours the whole franchise for me.  Doesn't help that the story also drags a lot, despite the fine animation.

Why do film companies and directors always seem to think that if they go a darker route, kill off beloved characters, and what not, that it will somehow make them feel more cool and meaningful?  That it will be more dramatic? That it will impress critics if they include unnecessary cruelty and drama? Or perhaps because they want to try to fix an already poor script...rather than doing a good solid logical one? Stop trying to impress critics (who also always seem to gravitate toward dark and mean as somehow better), don't tell me that it's the way 'real life' is because that's hooey, and I don't want real life (with it's meaningless random death and cruelty that you can do nothing about) and start trying to create enjoyable movies that people will want to watch over and over again.

That's what I go to movies for, for stories that hold together, entertain me, make me laugh, and make me feel like life makes sense.  I don't want your and the critics pet 'real life'.  That's not the function of story and never was...it was to reflect on the human condition and provide meaning, and do it in a very solid, planned, not random way.

  This...no.  And I don't think I'm alone in thinking it will turn off a lot of people, from all the Dragon movies and TV cartoons (since directors have done this schtick before and ruined a franchise in doing it.)  Too many films, especially animated ones, now seem to suffer from this...it's almost as if, if a person knows the critics love it, then they know they'd better be prepared for something mean-spirited and cruel.

Think I'm being too harsh?  Well, it's my opinion, so use your own judgement and feelings on the matter, but I don't find it dramatic or ironic to have a beloved character find their love again only to be killed ten minutes later when it could have been written differently and still have the same dramatic effect or even a better effect on the plot. Combine that with lots of other holes and awkward/bad plotlines, and you get suspicious.

And I think the marketing people knew that too, for I didn't see one commercial that hinted at what the director had in mind to really do, but instead concentrated on the fun or funny parts. I think the marketing people knew that if they even hinted at what was really going to happen that they'd kill audience interest.  In my opinion, they should have either killed the film or sent it back to be overhauled.

It may OK be for others, and that's fine, but for me, I want good adventure that I can feel happy watching.  I won't bother with this franchise again, or with anything else the director comes up with.",1416355200,18,2940,4.504708097928437

My family really liked ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and my youngest daughter really wanted them to come out with a sequel. In my experience, sequels generally are not as good or original, so my expectation was set pretty low. I was pleasantly surprised. The story line evolved in an interesting new direction while still remaining true to the original. Even my sixteen year old son thought it was a good movie and he groaned loudly against me renting it for the family. His tastes run more toward action/adventure and he thought it would just be something younger kids would like. However, as already stated, he really liked it.

Things about key story point that Spielberg found bold and interesting, and other explanation  about key scenes are just very interesting. They also showed some conceptual art sketches too. About one hour of goodies that's worth switching to blueray player. There are multiple featurettes such as Hiccup's inventions and battle weaponry showcase.

There's a few adult jokes, the characters are 5 yrs older, and there's lots of beautiful dragons throughout, including some different types of dragons that I don't believe we saw in the first movie. The second movie brings in some people from off the island to the mix, as well as the war theme which is relatively short.",1416182400,,508,4.462365591397849

6190879,3,B00HNH3HIU,I like the movie it was ok. it had more fighting then the first one. I also have a small child who's a How to train your Dragon fan. It was a bit much to see the dad killed by Toothless NOT a fun or needed to be in the movie! I think it was in bad taste. We all watched it and was disappointed with the ending.  I haven't been asked to see it again I have been asked to see the first show over again 2-3 times after seeing the Dragon 2  So I think the proof is in the asking-only the first one is being watched now.,1416096000,3,515,3.672727272727273

6190920,4,B00HNH3HIU,"We all know the feeling. You're looking through the upcoming film lists hoping for something good and all you can see are the titles of all the best animated films you've already seen, only this time with a little number ""2"" attached. ""Oh, spare me,"" you think, remembering the last one you watched, in which the main character from the first film had some kind of relapse and now he's got to learn all the same lessons again only this time in an almost unbearably stupid way. Everybody knows that ""High-Grossing Film 2"" is just a remake that's hoping to cash-in on its predecessor's success.

I was irritated when I heard there was going to be a ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" because I had only recently discovered the first and thought it was exceptional, and I did not want some tacked-on second film to blacken its name.

Well, make way, Toy Story 2, because you've got a friend!

Everyone knows the only animated ""2"" film that was ever worth watching was ""Toy Story 2."" Well that has changed. ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"" is not a rehash of ""How to Train Your Dragon"", but an almost perfect continuation of the story. We find Berk five years older, now a lovely place for dragons, and the recap scenes are a lot of fun. Dragon racing, jokes, and some new stuff in dragon riding. The animation is just brilliant. The scenery looks even more real than before, but of course the real magic of its animation is the expressions on people's faces - several times I caught myself critiquing the actors and then remembering that they are NOT actors, they are the work of many animators who are acting with their art.

That's all fine and well, so let's get to what's going to happen in this movie. Honestly there are kind of a lot of plots going on at once, though they do connect eventually. We've got some humorous but nasty people trying to capture dragons for their leader, who turns out to be an egotistical tyrant who wants to control all the dragons in the world. Some of it's fun, some is a bit annoying. The real plot of the film seems to be more concerned with Hiccup's family. *Spoiler alert if you haven't seen the trailer and don't intend to* Hiccup finds his mother, whom he believed to be dead, and I think this film handles the fantasy-sequel-lost-and-found-parent issue superbly compared to almost every other movie, animated or otherwise. It is very unique for one thing - it is not the father who was believed dead, but the mother; she is not evil, she was just selfish and realizes her mistake. (Speaking of her mistake, that's one aspect of the film that sort of rubbed me the wrong way. She is a likable character, but she has neglected her family for 20 years. That is a LONG time.) However, rather than having a blow-out between Hiccup's parents, we see Hiccup's father offering complete forgiveness (perhaps because he recognizes his part in her long absence), and this is honestly a breath of fresh-air (though I think in the long run there would be some pretty loud family arguments). Maybe it doesn't happen very often, maybe it's unrealistic, but whatever the case, it's much more enjoyable than watching people yelling at each other. Long story short, we've got a very good family subplot (or perhaps it's the main plot).

And then there are the dragons. If you like dragons, you'll like this movie. All kinds of dragons, even dragons who breathe ice instead of fire. With a dragon here, and a dragon there, here a dragon, there a dragon, everywhere a dragon dragon. And Hiccup is definitely NOT the only hero in this film. Toothless does more than his part.

But I guess the real greatness of this film is Hiccup's character development. ""Oh, no,"" you say. ""Don't tell me. He's dealing with the same problems he had before, right? Just another rehash film."" Well, not exactly. You might think so at first. Near the beginning Hiccup says he doesn't know who he is. But this is different and very close to reality. Hiccup has found his strengths in the previous film. He knows he's not like his father but now he's accepted for who HE is. End of story, right? No way. We all know how this goes. We think we finally know what we're good at, what we're supposed to do, and then we fall flat on our faces with THAT, too. ""I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be and I'm not the peacekeeper I thought I was."" The filmmakers didn't just throw something together and say, ""Do you like it, kids?"" Some real thought went into this film and I really appreciate it.",1415923200,3,4483,4.52157829839704

6190948,5,B00HNH3HIU,"I'm glad I saw no revealing trailers before I watched this movie so I was able to watch it without pre-expectations.  I didn't think they'd be able to top the first movie but they truly did.  The animation is jaw-droppingly beautiful.  The detail (at least on the Blu-ray) is exquisite.  They really upped their game in terms of the level of details in the rendering and the lighting was gorgeous in many of the scenes.  I found myself mesmerized simply looking at the individual hairs of Stoick's beard and the delicate mix of shades in it.  Though I found the performances at the beginning of the movie somehow a little off, once I was absorbed into the story, I began to see that the changes were because the characters had changed slightly in the intervening five years (story-wise), so their behaviors were a reflection of the changes time and increased maturity had wrought in them.  Hiccup's character arc was well thought out (thank you, Guillermo del Toro for your valuable contribution in that!) and very satisfying.  If the story doesn't move you to have tears in your eyes a time or two, you should check your pulse.  There's not much I can say without giving away too much.  I will give one 'warning,' however.  In the first 'Dragon' the story focused on Hiccup and Toothless' budding relationship.  In 'Dragon 2', the focus is primarily on the human relationships and interactions.  Some people may be disappointed by that.  I was not.  If you're a fan of drop-dead gorgeous animation and a heartfelt story, then this is the movie you should see.  It's also a movie that you can watch over and over again, picking up on new things with each viewing, especially with the background characters or simply to observe the beautiful lighting and ambiance of many of the scenes.  The most tender-hearted littlest ones may find some incidents a little too heart-wrenching but, beyond that, it's a very family-friendly movie.",1415923200,,1930,4.8

How to Train Your Dragon #2:  What.  Did.  They.  Do.  To.  This.  I can't believe how WRONG they got this sequel.  The story and characters were ripe for the plucking with the ending of the first!  >_<

The opening 30 minutes are o-k and I started to think they could pull it off, but then it took a real weird turn and the story stopped making any sense whatsoever.  Not to mention, **spoiler alert**, they go and do something really unnecessarily cruel and kill off a main character JUST as there was some kind of reconciliation/closure.  It felt totally abusive as a member of the audience.  They didn't earn my sadness with that move at all.  Instead it made me angry and frustrated.  Sadly, there is also a subtle political/social undertone to this sequel and it is the main reason so many ""unfortunate"" events take place.  If the heroes and heroines of the movie had been more ""hawkish"" and less ""sheepish"" they could have prevented a lot and there'd still be PLENTY for a good story/action sequence.  Not to mention a more positive feel-good movie and set up for a third installment.  Groan!  Don't muddy the waters all of you HTTYD#1 fans.  This will ruin your happy feelings you had with the first and leave you wanting to erase the second from your memory.  If you're dying to watch it, just rent it like I did.

6190985,5,B00HNH3HIU,"This is less a review of the movie (which was phenomenal) and more a review of the Blu-ray itself.

My 11 year old and I love the Dragon series - first movie, the first two seasons of the TV show, and the second film.  We love the growth of the characters, and thought they did an unbelievable job with the second film, since it's so difficult to follow up something as good as the first movie with something that can measure up.  They nailed it.

So I was looking forward to the Blu-ray release.  And it's everything I had hoped.  The movie itself looks gorgeous, sounds great, and I've had no complaints at all with the quality.  But what really makes this a 5 star item is the extras.  Yes, the 26 minute short about the beginnings of Dragon Racing is cool and fun (although not the same quality of animation as the movie, it's more on par with what DreamWorks did with the TV show, but a little better) and was a big hit for my son, but I really liked the deleted scenes.  They gave a bit more insight into some of the storyline, and I always love hearing things about how the story developed, how they changed something, and no longer needed a scene.  Some of them are rough animations since they weren't cancelled until they were that far along with the scene rendering, others are storyboards.

There are some kid-friendly (i.e. cute but not very deep) bits about Drago's weapons he uses to catch dragons, and other similar things, but for me, what made this so great was the almost hour long ""The Making Of"" video they had.  My son of course was bored with much of it, since he just wanted to see the ""cool"" things and not hear the background, but he'd perk up every time they'd show one of the actors or actresses and he'd yell, ""That's Hiccup!"" or ""That's Astrid!""  I like it when he can see the people who do the voices, and put a face to them since he knows the voices so well.  Sometimes it's a good fit with the character they play, sometimes it's not, but it's always entertaining.  They delved into their research and trips to Norway to view locations for ideas, and even had some great footage about a group of kids they showed the movie to before it was released to get their take on it, what they liked, what they didn't like, and what they thought the message of the movie was.  There was some of the technical work shown, some bits of some of the meetings they had, and just a good flow from beginning to end of the creation of the movie that was very well done.  They showed some of the actor's reactions as they were learning things about their character and how they've changed for the new movie, and it was really cool to see these actor's enthusiasm and love of their characters and the growth from the first movie to the second.

The movie looked great, sounded great, and the extras were above and beyond, so this is definitely a great deal for any fan of the HTTYD series.",1415750400,14,2901,4.340740740740741

I think we should have waited for it to hit Redbox for a third of what Amazon wants to charge for a rental...

Normally I would deduct it on principal alone, but in this case, because it's IS written well enough, Dragon 2 gets to keep the star I usually, automatically,  deduct for using CGI at all - After all,  it's a cartoon, and NOT actually trying to portray a realistic event on camera with it.

Watch the end credits - Scenes from the movie are presented in what appear to be REAL, hand drawn and painted, beautiful animation stills. Had both the first and this sequel film used this method, rather than CGI,  they would have been even better.",1415750400,2,850,4.458064516129032

6190998,1,B00HNH3HIU,"Warning, Spoilers!!!

The first How to Train Your Dragon was one of the most awesome animated movies my husband and I have ever seen and we have re-watched it many times.  We so looked forward to the sequel and immediately popped it in to watch it when it arrived today.  It starts out cute with the dragon race and those poor sheep.  However, we quickly noted that the tone was much more childish and immature than the first movie.  While five years were supposed to have lapsed between the two movies, Hiccup seemed even more immature than he was at the supposed 15 from the first movie.  He was more whiny and mopey than before which was pretty surprising.  His line when he said he never got to know his mother set off the first warning bell in both of our heads.  We could immediately tell that either (a) the villain had either killed his mother or (b) we were going to meet his mother.

The new dragons seen in this movie were overall very neat and enjoyable with the exception of the thing that Hiccup's mother (oh yeah, it was choice (b) above, we get to meet his mother) rode and the evil alpha dragon who looked nothing at all like a dragon (nor did the good alpha dragon but the good alpha was at least neat looking).

Yes, we get to meet Hiccup's mother (badly voice acted by Cate Blanchett whom we adore as an actress but if this is a sample of her voice acting, she should stick to real acting) who has this weird back story of not coming back after being kidnapped during a dragon raid 20 years ago so to save Hiccup from danger and because she needed to save the dragons.  Uh huh.

Then there is the death of the good alpha dragon after a very short and one-sided fight, that is quickly followed by Toothless somehow just so easily being overwhelmed and controlled by the evil alpha and as he goes to kill Hiccup (who by this time we were hoping would die because of his completely idiotic continuous peace and love, I can make anyone change their mind mantra), Hiccup's father Stoick leaps in front of him and takes the killing blow.  Bye, bye the wonderful voice acting of Gerard Butler for absolutely no reason other than the writers obviously hit the wrong square on the dart board that they mish-mashed this jumbled, contrived and easily guessed story together from.

The movie was obviously written much more for children but then they throw in some very dark moments, especially the death of Stoick and it makes in inappropriate for the younger children which this movie is so obviously aimed at.",1415664000,28,2520,4.461873638344227

6191016,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Having really enjoyed the first movie and seeing all the positive reviews for this movie, I fully expected to enjoy the sequel just as much. And on a technical level, it's a fine movie. Lots of good flying sequences, some individual character scenes are done well, and the movie does go to some length to expand the world that Hiccup and crew inhabit. In fact, I'd say that the ideas brought forth are worth dealing with and could've made a great story - ""could've"" being the word to note here.

*Spoilers from here on out.*

The problem with this movie, the reason why I view it as a disappointment, is because it's actually two movies trying to go through the runtime of one. Two basic plots - Hiccup reuniting with his long-lost mother, and the threat of dragon-capturing Drago - are pretty much going on concurrently. Either plot would have been plenty enough for one movie, and in fact Hiccup's mom, Valka, was supposed to be the main plot (and antagonist) of the film before the powers-that-be changed their minds (recall the scene where Valka is introduced to us while riding her dragon in freaky-looking armor and looking very imposing - that's a taste of what could have been). Instead, they reduced Valka to a supporting role and thus robbed her of any real significance or conflict and made Drago the main point of the story. As a result, the story feels very cut-and-pasted, as if they pulled a bunch of scenes from an earlier script, and much of the movie feels rushed and forced in places it shouldn't be, especially the ending. Likewise, in order to get in our new characters, most of the old ones (especially Hiccup's dragon-riding friends) have to be all but sidelined, restricted to a semi-humorous romantic plotline that never actually goes anywhere.

As for the darker, edgier tone? Well, that be great if they did anything with it. The rushed approach to everything actually robs the film of any real gravitas. Despite the heavy issues Hiccup experiences in this movie, he mourns and forgives in so rapid a fashion that I feel like I'm suffering plot-whiplash. Sometimes you have to slow down and DEAL with what's going, even in a film aimed at children (or else why go ""dark"" in the first place?)

In the end, I'm torn about this movie. A lot of it works, it's clear that a lot of effort was put into this film, and I know kids will still enjoy it. I just wish it had the real depth the first movie did, and in all honesty this movie feels like a step in the wrong direction.",1415491200,3,2497,4.566964285714286

6191042,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Im one of the few who didn't fall head over heels in love with the first How to Train Your Dragon, back in 2010.  I liked the film, I really did, and my kids loved it, but for me, 2010 had a slew of much better animated films to swoon over.  Obviously, there was the Oscar winning Toy Story 3, but I also found both Despicable Me and Tangled to be better films than How to Train Your Dragon.  Maybe its because I don't have an animal, but then again, Ive had them all throughout my childhood, so its not like I couldn't relate at all.

Regardless of my apathetic stance on the first film, I must admit that seeing the second one in the theaters made me kind of excited.  I was a real fan of the visual scope of the original, and seeing that played out on the big screen seemed appealing.  I also love Cate Blanchett, and she was a surprising addition to the voice cast; one that I was happy to see there.  My kids were also older, and I love seeing their excitement bubble over at the theater, and if the film was at least halfway entertaining and exciting then Ill have a good time.

For some weird reason my kids wound up seeing this in the theater without me and I was left at home.

Boo!

So, Ive finally seen this.  I hate that I wanted to love this far more than I actually did, and while my kids are hollering in the seat next to me and my friends and my wife and all saying how much they like this better than the original, I found myself horribly underwhelmed and thinking to myself that, while I didn't love the original, at least I liked it.  I mean, I guess I liked How to Train Your Dragon 2, sort of, but it all just felt somediocre.

For me, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a case of trying too hard to say something that it ultimately doesnt say and working too hard to force emotional sentiment that never makes good on the buildup and winds up being anti-climactic.  Yeah, its a very beautifully animated film.  It has the same sharp edits that made the first one soar with excitement.  It has a beautiful score that laces each scene, and the final battle is big and bold and stunning to watch; and yet it never really felt satisfying.  The subplot about family and the reunion between mother, father and son felt like a tacked on emotional subplot that didn't get the needed development.  This is all proven when a certain tragedy strikes and its handled with such nonchalance that my heart literally felt nothing; and this is coming from someone who has openly admitted to crying at everything!

This all just felt so hollow.

I know that Im in a clear minority here, but I really expected something more, and as the weeks have passed since I actually saw this, Im becoming less and less taken with it to the point where Im really disappointed that it didn't succeed in being something special, something that it could have been.  It has heart and it has excitement and it has a story and yet it all feels so lazily constructed and forced.  It never feels easy or effortless.

It feels like no one cared.

And LOL at Djimon Hounsou once again being hired to scream a lot.  What happened to this guys career?  Its a pity, really.",1415232000,3,3146,4.27195945945946
6191043,2,B00HNH3HIU,"It just didn't live up to the hype for me. The story moved so slow they might as well have called it How to train your Drag on 2. Get it because it drags on.... Moving along, There is no character development at all. It isn't like the first one, where it's a kid learning to trust dragons and dragons to trust people and people to trust dragons. The way this played out felt like it should have been a short special on the TV series. In this the characters leave off about the same way that they started.  Also the lighting is really bad for viewing. If the character is meant to have a hard time seeing something so will the viewers. It's a realistic natural lighting so I can see that they were going for something natural, but I don't drive my car without headlights because the moon has realistic natural lighting. I want to actually see the cool stuff on the screen.  Also all the side characters have next to nothing to do in the show and are either demoted to a long not really funny running joke or their personality is just sucked from them.

Pros - Animation

Meh - The villains

Cons - Character Development and Story",1415232000,5,1128,4.30188679245283
6191044,5,B00HNH3HIU,when i wen to watch this in theaters on 6/13/14 i loved it very much!!!!!!!!!!!! it inspired me to want to work with dramworks even more!,1415145600,,137,4.3076923076923075
6191045,5,B00HNH3HIU,"I like both versions of this movie as iTunes had a bundle for both versions.  Not to give away the story line but I did not like what happened to the dad but this forced the son to become greater.  That is real life but lol! Not only did the son grow into his own but so did his dragon!  Hopefully, I did not give too much away as this is a movie that I will watch more than once.

Update:

The DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital HD came in today and it can be played via iTunes and Ultra Violet.  We did not download it because we already have it downloaded from the iTunes store and it appears to be the same extras that is included on the DVD. We bought the DVD so we can watch the movie while the internet is down.

6191046,5,B00HNH3HIU,I am a person who enjoys dragon's.  The story was a surprise but I feel that it stayed true to the characters.  The movie was super great to me.  I have ordered several DVD's to give for Christmas presents.,1415145600,,206,4.230769230769231
6191047,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Loved the first one for its outstanding character development and superb animation.

Part 2 keeps the outstanding animation but plot and execution has withered.
Little of the delightful character interaction -- Toothless and Hiccup, Hiccup and Astrid, Hiccup and Stoic, Stoic and Gobber -- survives from the original. About the only real example in 2 is Stoic's brief song and dance with one he thought lost long ago. Nearly everything else comes down to the standard formula of chases and explosions, which is great if you prefer chases and explosions.

Not sorry I saw 2, but it made me appreciate, even more, the first film's rare charm and genius.",1415145600,2,651,4.963302752293578

6191055,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Looking forward to seeing this so much, and so give it five stars up front.  Why haven't I already pre-ordered?  Because, as is often the case, studios bring out a DVD, or a multi-disc Blu-ray version, and once you buy those, they bring out the next and more elaborate version.  Some reviews here talk about how it looks in 3D.  I have a 3D setup at home (LG 3D LCD-LED TV, Playstation 3, and surround sound), and I've bought several titles - the best has been THE ADVENTURES OF TIN TIN, which jumps out of the screen.

But so often there is a lag between the Blu-ray and the 3D release.  So which is it, Blu-ray or eventual 3D?  I take it reviews that include comments on the 3D are from those who saw it in 3D in a theater.

As for Gobber coming off as gay, since Craig Ferguson made a point of coming out, I'm not surprise that Gobber might have too.  I'll have to judge for myself.  Very glad that Dory, in FINDING NEMO, didn't make any comments to suggest she was a lesbian.",1415059200,,979,4.18716577540107

The sequel was more violent than the first, and seemed to be made for a bit more mature audience, so I wouldn't recommend it for children younger than seven or eight.

My only regret is that we missed it in the theater. The visuals are absolutely beautiful. The rendering is so incredibly smooth and the textures, just amazing. The story is well done and even deals with some heavy material in a really mature, yet (audience) age appropriate way. Kudos to the teams that created and developed this.

I would rather the rebellious youth and stubborn father discuss/negotiate and agree to a task rather than having the rebellious youth run off after the father/chief telling him no.

I don't know where to start.  I loved the first How to Train Your Dragon and wasn't sure even DreamWorks could put out a really good sequel.  I was wrong; DreamWorks exceeded my expectations!  This movie is set 5 years after the first so our characters are around 20 years old and Berk is well established as a co-habitating human/dragon community.  BUT, while Hic Up and Toothless were out exploring (and having fun doing it) they discovered the dragons in Berk were in serious danger.

Watch as Hic Up discover the mother he never knew and as the young dragon riders face their biggest battles.--- And that's all I'll tell you; just WATCH.",1413849600,,775,4.669117647058823

6191281,4,B00HNH3HIU,"Dreamworks Studio is celebrating its 20th year producing films, and it seems appropriate that the film that marks this occasion is about a 20 year old underdog who has managed to succeed by charming and befriending the supposed enemy rather than brutalizing it. Perhaps Im reading too much into this, but wait until I get to the part where I discuss How to Train Your Dragon 2 as a metaphor for American foreign policy!

How to Train Your Dragon 2, finds our hero, Hiccup (voiced once again by Jay Baruchel), enjoying the good life on his home Isle of Berk. Viking and dragon now live harmoniously thanks to Hiccups efforts to expose the compassionate nature of the once feared beasts. Now, dragons are domesticated pets on Berk, and the once relentlessly busy weaponry armory has been transformed into a saddle and bridle shop. Recreation is booming with the advent of a game that crosses polo with quidditch, and exploration is thriving with the swiftness of dragon transportation as opposed to Viking ships.

So the question remains, what conflict could possibly arise? The conflict comes in the form of an infamous villain by the name of Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) who captures dragons in order to enslave them and march on neighboring lands on a quest for power and land with the help of dragon catchers like Eret (Kit Harington). Upon the mention of Dragos name, Hiccups father Stoick (Gerard Butler) promptly initiates a preemptive strike on Drago before he and his army can move on Berk. This, of course, angers Hiccup who prefers a more diplomatic approach, famously successful in the previous film.

Now Im not saying that How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a thinly veiled allegory about American foreign policy and diplomacy in the 21st century. What I am saying is that a thriving civilizations leader repeatedly ignores diplomatic methodologies in favor of military actions when dealing with foreign totalitarian enemies who may or may not be armed with stolen or illegally procured weaponry of domestic origin. Take that Disney!

Analysis aside, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is an enjoyable follow up to the 2010 original. A talented voice cast features America Ferrera, Kristin Wiig, T.J. Miller, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Craig Ferguson, and Cate Blanchett among others.  When it comes to recommending animated features, I ask myself three questions: Is it enjoyable and appropriate for kids? Is it meaningful? Will it at least amuse adults? This film is most certainly amusing for adults. There are well-rounded characters and a beautiful animation style the keeps you engaged. The difficulty comes with the first two questions. Kids love the dragons, and Dreamworkss first priority was clearly to up the quantity of dragons: Mission accomplished. However, a complexity arises in the films quest for meaning at the sacrifice of appropriateness. Parental figures are often on death-watch in the majority of childrens animated fare for some twisted, sick reason, and that statement applies here as well. I won't go too into the details surrounding this element as it is one of the films major reveals, but I will say that if one takes a moment to empathize with the films most tragic moment, one might find oneself getting a prescription for an anti-depressant. Nonetheless, the family angle and its relevance to the films climax vigorously enhances the films overall meaning and sets the stage for a parallel battle of alphas that is both visually stunning and intensely engaging. Since the film has already dabbled in the darkness by giving us a violently disfigured protagonist (Hiccup lost his foot in the previous film), we may as well accept the lesson that if you're going to play with dragons, you might get burned.

The idea of a boy and his pet evokes only the cheesiest of family fair: from Air Bud to Lassie.  There's even a scene where protagonist Hiccup tearfully tells his dragon to ""get on out of here!""  On the other hand the deadlocked warlord antagonist of the film evokes John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.  Ultimately this film just isn't tonally very resonant.

In all honesty I cannot find the words to say I dislike this movie everything about it screams wonderful. The animation has improved, the music score sounds incredible, the voice acting is great with the new additions being interesting and unique, and the flight scenes are amazing to watch. Do I want to see this movie win the Oscar for Best Animation, that would be a yes. Truly I want to see other companies follow DreamWorks' example and know how to make a sequel without it being a re-hash of the same story told again. Movies like this should be an experience where the audience not only sees the subtle changes in the characters in both growth and development but also in their relationships, something of which is done well in many of DreamWorks movies. Not all of them but the ones that peak interest do. I will be looking forward with HTTYD3 coming out and will be watching what surprises will be in store from the animation studio.

The kids are still funny and deliver some decent comedy lines which is probably the saving grace.  I watched the first HTTYD multiple times, meaning the dialogue was clever and the characters well done.

Hiccup is bored and wants nothing more than to discover new things - new lands, new dragons, new everything. He wants to hang out with Toothless and he wants to avoid his dad. It is part of his character.
But as they say, turn over enough rocks and you're bound to find something that bites.
If you liked the first one, you will like the second one. A lot of people mentioned the animation; I hadn't really thought about it but then I thought about other animation movies. There are none like this. I think it takes some talent to make a movie that is completely CGI and have all the characters move like a real live person.",1408838400,2,932,4.241573033707865
6191299,5,B00HNH3HIU,"How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a film that spreads its mighty wings and soars through the clouds in a blaze of color, music, beauty, and magic. While watching it, I could only think of one word to describe how I felt; I was *dazzled*. I was entranced, beguiled, roused, wowed, and awestruck. This may seem like high praise to give to a children's movie, especially one coming from the studio who just gave us that instant classic Mr. Peabody and Sherman (note: sarcasm). I assure you this is not: How to Train Your Dragon 2 is not just the finest children's film of the year. It is one of the finest films of the year, period.

Director Dean DeBlois is a true artist. He weaves vivid images with the rousing and beautiful, ethereal John Powell score into a sensory feast that delights the eyes, head, and heart (the triple trifecta of movie awesomeness). Going literally where no camera can, Dragon 2 conjures up vast blue skies, loafy white clouds, shattered thorns of ice, vast battles, duelling titans, and explosions of whirling dragons. The visuals are, yes, dazzling, the CGI amazing, the imagery electrifying. And John Powell's score is a true standout. Something that can only be described in superlatives, Powell eschews the loud BraaaaHHMM's that we've heard so often for an orchestral and operatic symphony that will sink deep into your bones and make you want to soar on the back of a Night Fury.

But all would be for naught if it were not for the careful and impressive work of a talented cast. Jay Baruchel embues Hiccup with a charm that in another actor's hands would come off as cloying, but instead works to great and often very emotional effect. America Ferrera is excellent as Astrid, and Gerard Butler and Cate Blanchett's subtle work lights up the screen. But Djimon Hounsou, playing the terrifying Drago Bludvist (Say that five times fast.) could be a standout. He says every word like it hurts his throat, but when he screams  - the scream of a wounded animal with nothing to lose - you'll know why massive, fire-breathing, tooth-and-clawed dragons call him Master. All of these actors give their characters humanity and humor, elevating the film above your average kiddie fare. The drama is real and affecting, both for kids and their parents. The movie is just as brilliant and engaging in a scene with two characters talking, as when giving us epic dragon battles and action scenes.

In conclusion, How to Train Your Dragon 2 has everything a kids film needs and more. It's got humor and heart, drama and dragons, action and acting, and a strong moral fibre. Stunning visuals, epic music, great character and affecting acting all combine to make a memorable experience at the movies. I can't recommend enough that you take your kids to see this movie. And quite often, you'll be just as entranced as they are. I know I was. My rating? Five deadly nadders out of five.

6191301,5,B00HNH3HIU,"It's invariably very hard to create a sequel that equals the original. Humans and dragons are no longer mortal enemies and Hiccup has proven his worth, so where do you go next? A partial answer is to mature the characters, thus inviting a more sophisticated and complex story. Hence the characters are now young teenager rather than children. Yet  the audience requires the film retain the charm and magic of the original. This is no easy task.

It should also be added the TV series has exploited many of the potential story lines that could've been, should've been held back for use within sequel feature films. Whoever was in control of story development did themselves no cinematic favors with the TV  series.

Given the challenges it should be no surprise the script is rather ""busy and hectic"". I admit the story leaves less of an impression on the mind than the rather simplistic and heroic themes embedded in the first film. Yet the sequel is still a very creditworthy offering in its own right  and at least it isn't a reworked carbon-copy of the original. As with so many films these days, too much is ""given away"" in the previews. I curse the people who devise previews because they assume the audience wants to know the entire story before the sit down to watch the film! Dumb and dumber! However there is at least one surprise left out of the previews and it is a shocker.

Ultimately what rescues this sequel from mediocrity is two things; first the interaction between dragons and humans is quite priceless and delivers buckets of charm. Second the quality of animation is superb - a significant leap forwards. The physics are better, the animation is richer and the attention to detail is a step beyond the original. It is an extraordinarily beautiful film.

Finally, even though the story line isn't as ""epic"" or ""heroic"" as the first installment, it really is appropriate to the age and maturation of the characters. In this respect it also speaks to a maturing audience (at least amongst children who are becoming young teens).

This is one of those films that appeals both to children and adults. It has heart, it has memorable characters and plenty of sly satire, wit and humor. Above all it is very beautiful and looks really good on both HD and 4K screens. Thoroughly recommended.",1408492800,6,2303,4.74
6191302,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Seeing ""How To Train Your Dragon 2"" made me go back and watch ""How To Train Your Dragon"" as many times as the rest of my family would allow. Especially the scenes that showed the bonding between Hicccup and Toothless. That's because ""HTTYD 2"" didn't stay in the theaters long enough! I especially enjoyed the fact that after an opening sequence showing ""dragon-racing for fun"" in which Hiccup and Toothless were noticeably absent, the movie went right to them and we were treated to sequences that showed there friendship and love for each other. Those sequences actually revealed a deepening of their bond-- as Hiccup now carried a dagger, (in ""HTTYD"" Toothless made Hiccup kick his dagger into the water), which he now used to shave off pieces of wood. Toothless ""threatened"" to throw him over the side of the mountain unless Hiccup capitulated, which of course Hiccup did. Later on in the movie, Toothless bit off a branch from a tree and drew aimlesssly. When Hiccup said to Valkya, ""That's just something he does."" She laughs. I thought that was a good sot to the first movie, Toothless was still the same dragon at heart.

Astrid being the character whom shows up next is another good story progression. After all, she and Hiccup are engaged. Also, in ""HTTYD"", she was the one who found out about Toothless, but proved to be a convert after a day and night riding Toothless.

Story-wise, it goes from there and it all makes sense...

I should mention that I DID NOT look at any trailers for this particular movie. In fact, most of the time, I don't really like trailers, except short ones on a tv set or trailers that actually are basic and don't contain a lot of information. So, Hiccup needing to figure out who he is, and then meeting his mother, was a complete, and absolutely pleasurable surprise. Her showing up like she did, being dressed up and not knowing who she was, or if it was a woman or a man, was a thrill. Then finding out, who she was, and there was where Hiccup got his dramatic flare, was awesome.

Stoick's response to seeing her again--wonderful! But then he had to die--darn you, ""Lion King"". No, it fit the story, Stoick took the blast from Toothless in order to save Hiccup's life. The one caveat, it was just too short of a time where we didn't get to see Stoick and Valkya together, even time to just say, ""I'm sorry"". Now, I know that some people would shake their heads and wonder why Stoick didn't look like he had a scratch on him after he had been shot by Toothless, but there were children there, so I'm okay with that.

Once again, the turning point at the end of the story this time, was Toothless protecting Hiccup and again showing why Night Furys are so feared--they take on the strongest foes if need be--like their friend needs protection. In this case, dragons needed protection too. So, Toothless becomes king of the dragons and Hiccup becomes chief of Berk. He figures out who he is, and though his father is gone, but his mother is back, so that should be interesting for the next one.

I agree with every post on here that talks about the animation. It is superb. This time 3D really made a difference, whereas with ""HTTYD"" it didn't make all that much of a difference. Flying on the wings of a dragon--wow. If this movie doesn't get some OSCAR nods for the work they have done here, they will have really missed the boat!

6191305,5,B00HNH3HIU,"So you need to watch the first movie before this one because that one will tell you the story of how hiccup and toothless met.

Anyway I'm A huge fan of the whole dragon franchise, the continuity and attention to detail throughout HTTYD 1 and the dragon' tv series and HTTYD 2 is very well done. A scratch on the left side of toothless must have been there for a reason and in the tv series you find out why, they never went into detail why Hiccup had a scratch on this chin but they clear that one up in the second movie.
They also clear up allot of unanswered questions, like why does toothless actually have half a tail, for some that wasn't that clear in the first movie.
And they also tell us how old toothless actually is.

Ageing the characters was very well done, when the first movie came out in 2010 i would have been 14 when i watched it, so ageing the characters was genius, its like they have actually grown up with audience.

Dreamworks were using a new animation engine that they have made with INTEL, so the animation was next to realistic. The amount of detail in the Dragons facial expressions and wing movements was even better than the first movie.
Hiccup and Astrid had the biggest transformation with them being aged, My God they look amazing. The amount of detail in the hair and just the movement of both characters was outstanding.

The 3D was amazing, they really have taken advantage of the technology, it's not in your face like some films but it does give you a feeling that your actually flying with them. I'm guessing this would have been amazing in 4DX but i will never know :(
I want to say the color was amazing but the projector that was in the cinema i was in was very badly calibrated, and i know that for a fact because a few days later i watched another film in there and it was lacking color as well.
You would think for a $20.000 projector it would be decent.

Who is this movie for?
Well in my opinion ages 7+.
It can get a bit intense at some points, but then again when i watched it in the cinema there was only 10 of us in the screen, two being a 5 year old girl and boy and they seemed fine all the way though.

I literately can not wait for this to come out on blu ray and watch it on my 40"" 3D samsung tv, where the color won't be washed out and the film will look a lot crisper.",1408060800,2,2327,4.16

Yes, the pacing is a bit weird here and there and there are some insanely tough, traumatizing things that happen in this film that will leave some polarized about what could be seen as some deliberatly dark plotting. I don't want to spoil anything, but trust me, this film has the toughest sequence of any young-adult film in recent memeory -  that said - and that forgiven - this is a film of enormous scope, depth and power and yes - the finest 3D and animation art ever done for an American film.  And while I hope the 3/4 finale really sets its sights on the fan's favorite subject - the Toothless/Hiccup relationship, let's hope they don't forget the events of film 2 and the ramifications as those need to be further played out as this film kind of glides over some troubling things that happen - but all that said - this is a must see that really expands on the 1st film and GIFT OF NIGHT FURY (Sorry, I have seen the series and can't really count them as true cannon - they are a kid's show that most adults can really live without.)

6191308,3,B00HNH3HIU,"How to Train Your Dragon was like the Iron Man of animated movies a few years ago- it came out of nowhere, everyone loved it, and it was a box office smash. Toothless quickly became a household name, and you couldn't go anywhere without seeing a kid wearing a Toothless shirt. It quickly got an animated series and a sequel was in the works in no time. I'll admit, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it as well. Part of it might have something to do with the fact that it was written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, who were both responsible for a little movie called Lilo and Stitch. Trailers for the sequel made it look to be even bigger than the original, though they also revealed a lot more than they should have. It was hard to tell if everything had been revealed, and if so, what was the point of even seeing the movie?! I saw it on opening weekend and was shocked at how average it was, and just how many people praised it as being a perfect sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 is rushed, feels like an episode of the animated series with a bigger budget, and is so forced on cramming things in that it's hard to believe this was again, made by the same guys responsible for the first movie.

The movie takes place a few years after the first, and the vikings have taken to Hiccup's dragon training, using dragons in all kinds of activities, including a big game that his friends are involved in. Everything seems to be going well for the village, and Hiccup is out with Toothless, finding new places in the world to map out. The two are doing great together, even with their injuries. While out charting land, Hiccup and Astrid come upon a strange area where giant explosions of water have been frozen in place. They also discover a boat where a group of men are trapping dragons to use for a dragon army, led by Drago. They escape and tell Hiccup's dad, Stoick (leader of the village) about Drago, and he is immediately overtaken by fear, claiming that Drago needs to be stopped immediately because of what he's capable of. What's going to happen with the dragon army? Who is this strange hooded person following Hiccup around with their own special dragon? Just why exactly is Stoick so scared of some guy when he didn't even flinch at a huge threatening dragon in the last movie? Well, you find out all of the answers very quickly.

I'll get the things I liked about this movie out of the way first. Animation-wise, the movie is beautiful. There were so many times when nothing was going on on-screen that I just stared at the scenery and detail in things like character outfits, and it made me really respect the animation team. Things you wouldn't normally notice, like water, look absolutely phenomenal. If animated movies could get awards just for the quality of animation alone, How to Train Your Dragon 2 would easily be a top contender for the award this year. There were a couple of things that made me laugh a little, including Ruffnut going gaga over one of Drago's men. The movie isn't bad by any means, just painfully average, especially considering how great the first one was. I guess it's ironic that I compared the first one to Iron Man, since both the sequel for that and How to Train Your Dragon are lackluster.

What was so bad about the movie? Well, I can't go into it without revealing major parts of the movie, so you should skip the next whole paragraph if you haven't seen it yet. Let me at least say that aside from being rushed (seriously, they just zoom from one event to the next), there's no real emotional connection to any of the characters this time around, which is disappointing considering that someone who should be a major character isn't given much to do once they're introduced. Also, Toothless isn't around as much as I'd have liked. He does some cute and funny stuff in the beginning, and after that, he's mainly just used to fly around and shoot fireballs at people. Yes, that's kind of the point to Toothless, but they could have used him better.

Alright, now for the ""spoilers"" part. Again, skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the movie yet! When Hiccup's mom returns, it should be a big part of the movie. She hasn't seen her son since he was a baby and she was taken away from the village. When Stoick finds out she's alive, they have a cute reunion of sorts, and it's all interrupted by Drago's attack on her dragon sanctuary, where she's been taking care of all kinds of dragons over the years. Making sure that dragons are safe is her thing. During the attack, she doesn't try to talk to Drago about what he's doing (using the dragons for an army), and when he attacks her, she's quickly taken down, only to be saved by Stoick. It would have been great to have some kind of conflict between her and Drago, yet we get nothing and she quickly becomes a background character. They also chose an odd way to kill off Stoick, having him blasted by Toothless while under Drago's mind control. With how much damage a small blast from a Night Fury does, you'd think there'd be nothing left of Stoick. Nope! He looks perfectly fine- his clothes aren't even damaged! Look, I don't want to see him blown to bits or anything like that, but why not just not show him after he's been shot? Cut to his helmet flying away or something after Toothless shoots the fireball. Showing Stoick down on the ground, looking perfectly fine (aside from being motionless) softens the blow, and I kept wondering if he was playing dead. One big thing that bugged me was Hiccup being so obsessed with talking to Drago instead of taking him on. When he and Ruffnut are captured by Drago's men, he's quick to take out his sword and stand up to the poachers. Drago also makes for a very boring villain. Granted, it's nice not having yet another cool, calculated villain in an animated movie, although he never comes off as being much of a threat aside from having tons of dragons. He waves his spear around, screams, and suddenly the dragons obey him.

Kids will eat this movie up, and if anything, I'm glad it came out so my daughter and I could get some pretty cool Toothless merchandise over the last couple of months. The fact that How to Train Your Dragon 2 didn't reach the #1 spot in theaters, even losing to 22 Jump Street, which is rare for an animated movie (especially a sequel to a big one) to lose out to a comedy, really says something. Still, it manages to get mostly positive reviews from people somehow. I recommend renting it before buying if you haven't seen it yet, then decide for yourself if it's worth the full price. This is one I probably won't be watching in full ever again, just in tidbits when it's on in the background.",1407542400,12,6699,4.46530612244898
6191309,5,B00HNH3HIU,"My daughter and I went to see this after all the Frozen hype, and we both enjoyed this movie even more. It was agruably better than the first, and one of my Top 3 favorite animated movies of all time (Ratatoullie, Guardians of Ga'hoole). The animation is superb; the overall scenery and graphics of the ocean/ ice are first class. The depth and detail reminded me of Dragon Hunters visually. They build on the main characters, the original storyline, and then add sooo much heart touching warmth to the movie.

There is the father-son aspect, the mother-son, the mother-father, the bonds of friendship, and of course, the boy and his pet (best friend). Any one of these could bring you to tears, but some how they find a way to add all of them but in a natural and unforced way. The art, cinematography, story, voice acting, music, and sound-effects were all top notch. I could not find anything to dis-like about the movie. I walked out of the theaters wanting to play with my daughters, kiss my wife, call my parents, and bear-hug my dog.

So, Dragons 2 was a let-down.  There seems to be very little character development, the dialogue has lost that snappy fun rhythm, and it's just kind of boring.

6191312,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Origins

I had mixed feelings on the first How to Train Your Dragon. On the one hand, the animation and artwork was pretty solid. On the other, it didn't' really push animation forward in any way that was obvious. On the one hand, it's characters were charming. On the other, they didn't really have that much depth for the most part. But some amazing music in key sequences, a plot about understanding and being true to yourself, and a couple of AMAZING flight/fight sequences made it a solid ""buy it on the cheap"" recommendation. The sequel, however, is a whole different beast entirely.

I've been watching the development of Western animation for some time. I watched the rise, fall, reawakening, decline, and reconstruction of Disney animation. I've watched anime go from manga-ish to humanoid to distopian to cgi-infused and flash animated. I've seen a few rare geniuses like Genndy Tartakovsky push boundaries and then seemingly disappear. What I've hoped and dreamed of, however, is a genuine GROWTH of Western animation from the vanilla, paint-by-the-numbers, happy-ending-guaranteed, bathroom-humor-comic-relief-plagued mess that it has been into a fusion of the best of East and West. I want to see films that have high budgets, gorgeous artwork, genuine and compelling characters, and deep plots. In the East it was tried first with TMNT and Astro Boy, and that drove IMAGI straight out of business because it was just too soon to wean Westerns off of their crude Shrek jokes. But now, finally, at last, the reconstruction is complete and we have arrived!

The Ice Age Films are fun but dry, and everyone knows how much I hate the Shrek series (yuck!). I was cheering for Tangled and Frozen simply because (while imperfect) they moved PAST the old Disney without chucking the baby out with the bathwater (on the whole I'm not a fan of taking darker and edgier too far). Kung Fu Panda started out a little like all of the above, being a bit crude, a bit formulaic, a bit vanilla, a bit dry, and a bit action-oriented, but clearly Kung Fu Panda 2 was where Dreamworks realized a critical truth. They can take a sequel, and instead of just more of the same, they can go DEEPER. Kung Fu Panda's animation was a quantum leap over the first film. It's cinematography was miles again. But it's DEPTH showed the path ahead for animation in the west, and this film takes that idea even further.

I may start crying here...

The first How to Train Your Dragon was a good film. It was fun. And it had the beginnings of character and plot depth by the end of the film. Well this film sequel is... an incredible leap forward over the first film.

Don't get me wrong. From a purely technical film-making point of view, the first How to Train Your Dragon is probably better paced, and more balanced. The climax of this film, the sequel to the first How to Train Your Dragon, comes too soon. There are sequences that perhaps carry on too long. It maybe tries to juggle too many plot points and character threads at once. However!!!

My eyes may get cavities from all the eye-candy, but it will wash out in the tears

There are sequences in this film that take your breath away. The details, the use of color and light, the sophisticated effects, are pure art. Not good. Fantastic! The action sequences are even better than the first film (albeit not as well paced perhaps). Many scenes, though have a depth of film-making that makes this almost irrelevant. There is dragon wing-walking reminiscent of Panzer Dragoon. There is a whole CULTURE of Dragon Riding that makes one think of the Chronicles of Pern. We're talking about the greatest and most iconic Dragon-lore in existence here people. They creatures no longer look like cartoonist buffoonish creations but are inching closer to...a beautiful reality (please, please, PLEASE let there be a Panzer Dragoon or Pern film soon...)

Even if none of that existed, however, this film would be a giant stride forward for one reason: the characters have enormous depth. I'm not talking about moments of emotion like Simba's dad dying (man I cried on that one as a 12-year-old) or maybe some formulaic my-parents-just don't-understand stuff like in the first film, or heck seemingly every Disney film from the 90's. No I'm talking about reuniting the family, building a relationship with your significant other, betrayal by someone you love, failure and self-discovery. The protagonist and his love interest are not squabbling kids, they are unsure young adults. Toothless is not a wild animal, he is a dear friend and companion. And instead of being just another gruff parent who doesn't understand (ala-Disney's Brave) Hiccup's father acts...like a father. Even the community of people who live around our protagonists seem more like people and less like window dressing. In other words...

Lessons Learned, and More to Come

This is the realization of a life-long dream of mine. At long last, anime fans seem to have taken over Western animation, and we are getting the best of both words. Gone are purely comic-relief characters, replaced with side characters with depth and personality. Gone are the infantile arguments of bratty teens and gruff parents, replaced with caring adults and sincere young adults. Gone are the empty, hollow-ringing paper-thin life lessons of ""trust your heart"" and ""believe in your dreams"", replaced with ""take a stand"" and ""protect your family"" while being true to yourself. I feel like kids who watch films like this might actually LEARN something other than that their parents are stupid and believing in something makes it happen; they might learn to be brave, selfless, loyal, and loving. And who can argue with that?

This is what you get when you combine an American animation budget and overall values, with the depth of plot, character, and attention to details of an anime. This is a VERY good sign of things to come. Keep it up Dreamworks! I am inspired, and on the edge of my seat. I cannot wait for the sequel!",1406505600,28,6001,4.855327468230694
6191313,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Who knew an animation could be as good as a live action movie that's worthy of being the best film of the year? Let me say, How to Train Your Dragon 2 deserves to be a contender of being the best movie of 2014. You may gloss over that fact because it's an animation, but this film is very dark and has a great story. In the first film, we met Hiccup, just some guy, but in this one, Hiccup has to stand up and be the man. I honestly thought I was going to cry 3-5 different times in this movie. The voice acting sounds authentic, the CGI is a spectacle to the eye, and the soundtrack is wonderful. I implore you to go see this if it's still playing in your local theater or drive in!",1406419200,11,683,3.9565217391304346
6191314,5,B00HNH3HIU,"In a crowded summer full of satisfying blockbuster hits, it might have been easy to forget about ""How to Train Your Dragon 2"".  But while many people may have forgot about it as it was being released, the ones who did have the pleasure of sitting down and watching it will realize it's truly an unforgettable film.  I did not expect this to be as good as it was.  The trailers, though very pretty, didn't seem to really lure me in.  I was happy they were making one, sure, but I felt like they showed too much and that the villain was lackluster.  I was dead wrong.

You can tell Dreamworks realizes they have something special here.  Unlike the flat, profit-focused sequels to franchises like ""Shrek"" or ""Madagascar"", this sequel shows the blood, sweat, and tears it probably took to make this film. As I already hinted, this film is visually mind-blowing.  It's gorgeous all around.  The first film looked wonderful when it came out but holy crap the jump in quality is apparent right off the bat.  I couldn't help but be amazed with the texture and detail on Toothless this go around.  Some of the shots of the environment or landscapes looked like live action in some of the other big budget blockbusters this summer.  Hell, some of the CG looked more impressive than in ""Godzilla"" and ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"".  The flying scenes in particular as this go around give you a true sense of what it would be like being high up there with the wind and the views--the force of the speed that comes with being on the back of a Night Fury.

Underneath all the eye candy is where this film really is special.  Afterall, in the following years when other animated films catch up and surpass this movie visually, this film will still standout for it's story and characters much like ""The Lion King"" does today.  The trailer did show a bit more than I wanted, but there's still plenty of more that will sweep you off your feet here.  My wings are completely clipped as I don't want to spoil anything, but adults will walk away loving this film like the kids will.  As someone who typically is against sequels to these kind of films (because the first ones usually end on just the right note), this is as good of a sequel as I could have hoped for.  It brings the characters to new heights, raises the stakes, and truly has them transform or grow into the characters they will become for the rest of their lives.  And it's beautiful.

Like the first film, the voice acting and music are staples to this one.  This film is made with wonderful talent in every vein.  The new characters really fit in with the returners.  The dragons we are introduced to in this film are creative and impressive to look at.  The villain is refreshingly evil.  So many villains today have to be tragic and sympathetic because it's the style these days in film.  This dude is just a dark, angry man.  But in a cool way--and the fact that he's voice by ""Blood Diamond"" star Djimon Honsou doesn't hurt.  But just like everybody else, I watched this for Toothless and Hiccup.

The two stars of the film are both visually a bit older but still young and playful at heart.  However, both get thrown into circumstances that they have to overcome.  The film doesn't shy away from tragedy but the lessons at it's heart are powerful for it's audience, no matter the age.  Very early on you can see Hiccup has become an adventurous young man, who by now (especially with a powerful dragon on his side) is no longer scared to take dangerous risks or to stand up for himself and/or friends.  He and Toothless have been together for so long now that they pretty much have conversations and have such chemistry that they are a team in every sense of the word.

The climax of this movie is breathtaking.  It just makes you want to cheer loudly, even on the inside.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews are justified and by the time the credits roll, you will have realized you've just been hit with one of the best animated movies to date.  Many people have said it's better than the original but I don't know if I can go that far.  The first ""Dragon"" movie is a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned.  Is this one more grande? Evolve the characters? Improved visually?  Yes to all of those.  But, I really loved the period where Hiccup and Toothless were just building that bond (then defending it towards the climax of the first film).  In this one, they have been comrades for 5 years give or take.  But, it does take their relationship to some new places and it does a great job with it.  I just simply cannot say which film I hold more dear to my heart.

I know a third film is almost inevitable, but I'm scared because I don't know if they can hit a grand slam three times in a row.  But, I do have a feeling that if and when a third one comes, we will explore Toothless' origins or if he's truly the only Night Fury left.  Just a hunch.  I'd also love to see the Vikings encounter some Mongrels or something so we can maybe have some asian-esque dragons thrown into the mix.  Just some ideas. Nevertheless, I love where this film puts our two main heroes at the end of this incredible sequel.",1406332800,10,5151,4.433439829605963

My first thought was ""This is either going to be epic or a bust"". I went to the midnight premier and thank goodness it wasn't the later. All of the action, romance, comedy, emotion, and everything from the first movie, double it, and you get How to Train your Dragon 2. Probably my favorite movie. The commercial was right, it is better than Brave and arguably better than Frozen. This is better than the first film, and not a whole lot of sequels can live up to that. I went and saw it again in theaters yesterday with some friends and at the end of the film, they both said, ""That. Was. EPIC."" and both agreed with me on my previous statement. If you have not seen it, you're seriously missing out. It also has a few respectful nods to the first movie, so, pay attention. Don't want to give anything away, but if you think the trailers gave too much away with revealing Hiccup's mother, Valka, just wait until you see what's past all of the previews (roughly 30-45 minutes into the almost 2 hour movie).",1405641600,5,1291,4.338842975206612
6191319,5,B00HNH3HIU,"I absolutely loved the first ""How To Train Your Dragon"" movie, which I feel is one of DreamWorks' best animated films to date (with perhaps only ""Rise of the Guardians"" being a possible better film).  It combined beautiful animation with a moving story and deft humor that didn't rely on pop culture references to succeed, and I fell in love with its world and characters (both human and dragon).  So when a sequel was announced, I found myself very hesitant to watch.  Sequels have a higher chance of bombing than other films, because they not only have to succeed on their own merits, they have to match their predecessor as well.  And given that ""How To Train Your Dragon"" is a film close to my heart, I was understandably wary.

My fears were unfounded -- ""How To Train Your Dragon 2"" is just as great a film as the first, visually inventive and with a somewhat darker but still thrilling and entertaining story.

""How To Train Your Dragon 2"" takes place five years after the events of the first film, and the village of Berk has grown accustomed to having dragons and dragonriders in their midst.  Hiccup, now a respected dragon trainer, is being groomed by his father, Stoick, to become the next chief, but he's reluctant to take up the duty, instead choosing to explore the land beyond Berk on the back of his Night Fury, Toothless, and find his own destiny.  When his wanderings bring him to cross paths with a dragon trapper, he learns of a powerful enemy making its way toward Berk -- Drago Bludvist, a warlord with his own harsh methods of controlling dragons... and a dragon army of his own bent on conquering and/or destroying all in their path, human or dragon.  Defying his father's wishes, Hiccup takes off to find Drago and sway him from his goal... only to encounter a hidden dragon sanctuary, and an enigmatic rogue dragonrider with a shocking connection to Hiccup's own past.  Can Hiccup, his newfound ally, and his friends from Berk stop Drago and save both Berk and the dragons from a horrible fate?

The animation of this film is gorgeous, perhaps even better than the first film.  The animators have a keen eye for detail, and they manage to make inventive landscapes, fantastic flight scenes, and wonderfully creative designs for the dragons.  In addition to the usual suspects from the first film -- Toothless, Deadly Nadders, Gronkles, Monstrous Nightmares, etc. -- we have Skullcrusher, a dragon with a beetle-like look; Cloudjumper, a four-winged dragon with owl-like features and mannerisms; the Bewildebeast, a massive white dragon that looks like a cross between an elephant and a lionfish (a combination that actually WORKS, astoundingly); and many more.  As a dragon lover myself, it was a real treat to see so many types of dragons in one film, especially dragons that buck the usual generic look of dragons in fantasy media.

The old characters from the first movie are back, many with subtle differences to indicate the passage of time -- Stoick has gray in his beard, the male teen characters have noticeable stubble, etc.  Hiccup is older and more experienced now, but many kids and teens will identify with his struggle to find his own place in the world.  Stoick seems to have softened since the last film, a more caring father as opposed to the distant disapproving figure of the first film, but given the character growth he underwent in the first film this is understandable.  Astrid is her usual snarky, tough self, though she doesn't get as many moments to be a badass in this film.  And there's a hilarious rivalry between Snoutlout and Fishlegs as they compete for the affections of Ruffnut, to her and her twin brother's disgust.

Of the new characters, Valka, the new dragonrider, is the most interesting.  She's a wise and curious individual, tough and strong, but with an unexpectedly tender side, and she brings out a new side in a few of the other characters.  (More on this I won't say...)  The dragon trapper, Eret, feels like a superfluous character, though seeing Ruffnut crush on him was hilarious.  Drago is largely a generic baddie, but is menacing and frightening enough to be a formidable antagonist.

Darker and more emotional than the first film, this is still every bit as good as its predecessor, and a must-see if you're a fan of the first movie, a dragon fan, or simply enjoy an epic and heartfelt story.  Probably best for ages 8 and up due to violence.",1405555200,2,4423,4.749019607843137
6191320,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Hiccup and Toothless fly through the clouds, gliding over water and unexplored lands. The two are the closest of friends and could clearly spend every moment of the day together. Their bond allows them to depend on and trust one another. And this long moment of unadulterated joy helps to relink us to the world, to make us remember everything that was good about How To Train Your Dragon.

Everyone is back to reprise their roles. Jay Baruchel turns as Hiccup, the son of the Viking King Stoic (Gerard Butler). Thanks to Hiccup and Toothless, their little kingdom now accepts dragons of all kinds, harboring them and giving them sanctuary as pets. Hiccup and Astrid (America Ferrera) ride their dragons out, exploring the vast areas around them. Hiccup, now older, seems determined to chart all of the unexplored lands. One day, Hiccup stumbles upon pirates who are trying to capture dragons for Drago (Djimon Hounsou), who has an old score to settle with Stoic, but he escapes and stumbles upon a dragon sanctuary protected by his long-lost mother Valka (Cate Blanchett). Hiccup brings mother and father together again just in time to battle Drago. Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Kristen Wiig and T.J. Miller all return as Hiccup and Astrids friends. Craig Ferguson plays Gobber, Stoics confidant and friend. Kit Harrington (HBOs Game of Thrones) does the voice of Eret, a pirate trying to help Drago round up dragons for his army.

Written and directed by Dean Deblois (How to Train Your Dragon, Lilo & Stitch), both of the Dragon films are beautiful to watch. The animation depicting Hiccup and Toothless flying through the vast wilderness and over the oceans, high in the sky, is simply breathtaking. All of the characters and backgrounds are also created in a lush way, giving them depth, interest and viability.

The animators realize the animated flying is good, because it seems to dominate this sequel, allowing less time for character interaction and development.

And this is where the film falters. The minor characters, who provided so much of the comedy for the first film, are more or less ignored. The main focus of this sequel is Hiccups mom, Valka, how the family interacts and reunites with her and their big battle with Drago. Dragon 2 seems to be borrowing a bit from classic Disney films, introducing a parental figure only to put them in peril, forcing the younger offspring to grow up faster. Any film with Cate Blanchett is good, but the film needs more comedy and hijinks.

The real triumph is in the animation of Toothless. I have read that he was designed to resemble one of Miyazakis characters and the animators have given him all of the characteristics of a puppy or kitty. It is really fun to watch him bound around and tease Hiccup before tackling and licking the human from head to toe. His mannerisms are very much like that of a small pet. Toothless seems to come alive and the work done to create him is scary good.

The problem with most sequels is that they just aren't as good as the original. You might leave the theater feeling some enjoyment, but it isn't the same feeling you experienced when going to the first film. And this makes it harder to appreciate or get excited about the new film.

""How To Train Your Dragon 2 is no exception. There is a lot of good stuff here, but the freshness and sense of discovery is gone, detracting from the overall experience.

Dreamworks has had some difficulty creating new animated features lately. Mr. Peabody and Sherman didn't make enough money. The Croods did better, but not great. The only success they have had is with sequels, so They are now going to concentrate on sequels. More How To Train Your Dragon, more Madagascar and Penguins, more Puss In Boots. These sequels already have built-in name recognition, giving them a leg up on the marketing. But Dreamworks runs the risk of using characters beyond their staying power. In Dragon 2, Hiccup is a young man, with much more confidence. He has less to learn about being a brave young man and there really doesnt seem to a whole lot of training going on. In Dragon 3, I can imagine where they will go, but it seems to be a stretch to mention anything about training. They also run the risk of not developing or discovering the next Shrek of Madagascar and robbing their audience of a potential classic.",1405468800,12,4353,4.756291390728477

6191329,5,B00HNH3HIU,"While I loved this film, I must warn parents that it is particularly violent. In this film Hiccup meets his mother after she abandoned him. While this reunion was happy, this might be emotional for single parent children who think mommy and daddy can magically get back together like they do in the movies. In addition to all the fighting, a major character is killed off. This film is far more the emotional roller coaster for kids than the first film or the TV episodes. There is also a line that was meant to imply homosexuality, although it was so ambiguous most people will miss it ""And that other thing.""

The mother reunion thing was a bit awkward. I had Star Wars flash backs toward the end as Hiccup uses the force to control Toothless and go after the Alpha Death Star and Darth Vader.

While there is plenty of killing and violence, there is no gore, The film cuts away at critical moments, although you know what happened.",1404777600,,934,4.520710059171598

6191331,5,B00HNH3HIU,"There was no way to capture the freshness of the first movie, one of my all time favorites.  Instead DreamWorks advanced the story five years, aged the characters (something animation rarely does), and gave them new, more mature conflicts to resolve.

I will not go much into the plot - I think the trailers revealed too many spoilers as is - but there are two major conflicts here.  One is external with a new bad guy raising a dragon army and trying to conquer all the islands. The more interesting conflict is internal, with Hiccup now a young adult and finding his place in the world, especially since his father Stoic wants to hand over the reigns of the village chief to his son.  It also proves to be as much a journey for Hiccup's pet dragon Toothless as it does for the main characters.

Let's just say there are some amazing flight and battle sequences here, a horde of new dragons filling the screen (the film is worth watching more than once for all that is happening in the background) and all our old friends are back and often as funny as ever - those twins never stop bickering.  There are also two new characters, voiced by Cate Blanchett and Kit Harrington, that prove crucial to the unfolding plot.

I agree with some reviewers that the bad guy is a pretty one dimensional, and things get a little too fast and furious at the end.  And a personal quibble - not enough Terrible Terrors.  But for such a large animated canvas, the emotional core of the film is still intimate and powerful.  That to me is amazing for any film, let alone one done with computer drawn characters.

Director Dean DeBlois is on record saying he got into movies after watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and it shows.  It is a family, PG rated film, but the tone is darker, the stakes are higher and so are the consequences.  Where too many companies produce a sequel that basically rehashes the original film, DreamWorks boldly created a whole new film.",1404604800,,1948,4.531428571428571

6191336,5,B00HNH3HIU,"This movie is great. Animation is superb, the soundtrack is once again amazing, and the characters have matured but still retain all of the things that made them lovable in the first place. The plot is, yes, darker than the first and I can understand why this may turn away others. This movie isn't the innocent film the first one was. But isn't that a good thing? I'd hate it if the sequel was just a retread of the first. Instead, it builds off of the first and introduces a new chapter in the life of the Vikings of Berk. It does everything a sequel should - it continues the relationships Hiccup built in the first, while introducing new ones, most notably his mother. Hiccup is no longer the ""boy"" Hiccup, and he must become the ""man"" Hiccup. This movie tracks that change, and it does it remarkably.

Currently, this is my favorite movie of 2014. Go see it!",1403481600,,863,4.427672955974843
6191337,5,B00HNH3HIU,"Five years have past since the great dragon war and life has been good.  The Vikings and Dragons live in peace and work together to make life better.  And all the main characters are older - but a few of them have not really grown up (and you can probably guess which ones that is).  But when Hiccup and Astrid are exploring surrounding islands they come across a group of Dragon trappers, who tell them of another Dragon Rider and of a new threat Drago Bloodfist.  Despite warnings from Stoick, Hiccup and Toothless ride out to convince Drago that peace can be achieved, when they run into said rider - and a face from his past that he thought lost.  But when Drago cannot be convinced, which Dragon master will prevail - one who uses fear and intimidation, or the one who uses respect and love.

This movie was amazing, from the locations of Berk to Ice island, to the characters and dragons that live in this world.  This one has everything - laughs, love, and reunions, but also the threat of war, and of loss.  But despite the turn of the serious, this movie takes the first one and turns it up many levels as you watch the coming of age of one young Viking and Dragon.  Now the question will be, when Dragon 3 comes out in 2016 how can they top this (hopefully find a female Night Fury for Toothless).

Watch this in the theatres and they pick this up when it comes out later.",1403481600,,1382,4.321705426356589
6191338,5,B00HNH3HIU,"The original ""Train you Dragon"" was a delightful, beautifully rendered romp. I'm not denying the darker moments, just enough to give some real drama, but a kids' movie you don't need a kid to watch.

This movie does a great job of extending the myth. The premise - whatever can be used well can also be used badly -  echoes many things a kid will see in the real world. The flight scenes were wonderful, too (but Hiccup needs to take a bit more responsibility for his own flight plans, or lack thereof). Rendering, as always, was top notch - even complex things like hair come across beautifully. And there's lots more, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers here.

In fact, the only thing I found seriously flawed was the movie's approach to violence. It builds up to open war, including fatalities. All very exciting stuff, but oddly bloodless. At least two scenes show the demise of a major character, but without the physical ruin that would necessarily follow. With so many concerns about people losing sensitivity to violence, I'm not sure this is a good direction to go. (I don't propose that kids' movies become blood-fests, either, but injury can be acknowledged without becoming gore-porn.)

That aside, I loved this one. And, if you look closely, the dragons get all the best lines.

6191342,5,B00HNH3HIU,"When most sequels USUSALLY cant hold a candle to their predecessors, Dreamworks release of How To Train Your Dragon 2 was exactly the opposite. I found this film far more engaging, interesting and definitely full of emotional ups and down mixed with fun and inventive humor (as an added bonus) than a lot of films I have seen in the recent past!

 Director Dean DeBlois (Lilo & Stitch, How To Train Your Dragon) did a wonderfully magical job of taking a screenplay written by himself and turned it into a truly real family-based adventure. The movie is about father and son relationships; Its about separated parents; Its about judging people (or Dragons) based on their circumstances and one time actions; Its about judging people by their appearances and discovering almost everyone around you is more than you ever thought he, she or it (dragons) could ever be.

 Everyone is back including Jay Baruchel (The Sorcerers Apprentice, This Is The End) as Hiccup, America Ferrera (Ugly Betty, End of Watch) as Astrid  the strong and dependable support of Hiccup, Jonah Hill (Superbad, 21 Jumpstreet) as Snotlout  a little on the dense side, Kristin Wiig (Bridesmaids, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) as Ruffnut the Tomboy of the bunch and even Craig Ferguson (Hot In Cleveland, Brave) as Gobber  the not-so-bright side kick of the family.

 Making a very warm and heartfelt portrayal of a real father is the return of Gerard Butler (300, Gamer) as Stoik who does a wonderful job of connecting with his son and family in a very touching and tear-jerking way. Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine, the Lord of the Rings) is Hiccups mother who was long remembered but not forgotten as it was believed she had died in a fight for her tribe.

 This whole premise creates a real sense of family growth and sensitivity to the hearts of children who either have separated parents or have seen their parents reunite for whatever the reason for them to have been apart. Yes, there are plenty of new, fun and colorful Dragons throughout and they all have unique abilities and the most charming of personalities. They are so much fun to watch and lots of adventure packed action too.

 The villain in the film is a mean and wounded reject of society who learns how to take control of all dragons and to his advantage, take control of all people. This character is called Drago and is artfully voiced by Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, Blood Diamond). He too learns a valuable lesson by the end of the film and it all wraps up very nicely too.

 This is definitely a three tissue movie and I completely understand why it received the PG rating as young kids might enjoy the colorful, fun and funny dragons in the film, the real heart of the story is a true tragedy, with a heartfelt and very meaningful message for families of all sizes and cultures. This was surprisingly enjoyable for a lot of reason. Not only did I laugh and stare in amazement at the beautiful animation, but I never expected to leave the theatre appreciating just a little tiny bit more, all the people I really care about and the people that I love most in my life. How To Train Your Dragon 2 should definitely should be seen with your family and/or you closest friends.tell them Lorenzo from the [...] told you too!",1403222400,4,3262,4.678321678321678
6191343,3,B00HNH3HIU,"Whats it about?

A small Viking Community has embraced their former nemesis into their lives but there are bigger dangers than just Dragons lurking in the unexplored seas.

What did I think?

HTTYD2 presents itself as a film with a moral compass but that compass is spinning like a roulette wheel. The characters empower strong women by letting men rescue them. They instill a sense of duty by showing the value of rebellion. They pursue the idea of nonviolent conflict resolution by blowing characters into smaller pieces.

Despite this there are enough bold decisions made by the director to keep children amused and adults from ducking off to the bar. It could have done with some better jokes and less reliance on the power of love.

Or perhaps I'm just jaded.

No, I was right the first time. The power of love is just lazy storytelling.",1402963200,5,842,4.732876712328767
6191344,4,B00HNH3HIU,"Hiccup, voiced by Jay Baruchel, is back with his wounded and repaired Night Fury dragon Toothless. Hes a little older now and sort of a legend in his small community of Berk. He changed the way his people lived in the first How to Train Your Dragon. The dragons now live among the people as companions and helpers. Things are peaceful, happy and productive five years later, but we wouldnt have a movie if it was going to stay that way.

First and foremost, the imagery and design of HtTyD2 is absolutely breathtaking and epic fantasy adventure stuff. In the five years that have passed since we last saw Hiccup and Toothless destroy the Red Death and end the war between the Vikings and Dragons, they have perfected many gadgets and flight techniques and it was cool to see the creators put this into the forefront. This detail added to the movies worth and authenticity.

The introduction of the vigilante Valka in the first third of the movie was absolutely top notch. Everything about the characters introduction was awe-inspiring and had all the intrigue and visual coolness of anything that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg ever dreamed up. The entire revolution of the character throughout the film was incredibly interesting and essential to the quality of the film.

Director and writer Dean DeBlois crafted a worthy follow-up to the hit from 2010 and much of that is possible by crafting a worthy and fear-inspiring villain. Drago Bludvist, voiced by Djimon Hounsou,  is a conqueror amassing an army of dragons and his character is also very effectively used. The build up to his introduction is done well and makes for some very intense storytelling.
How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a more mature turn than the original. The danger is greater and the intensity and drama that hangs over the film will be a lot to swallow for some smaller children. The humor is still for all ages, but this movie is more of a rival to Lord of the Rings or Star Wars than most childrens movies.

While there is much to praise about HtTyD2, the outstanding buildup and development of the story was followed by a disappointing finale. We all know its coming but the tact and development that made the film so engaging went by the wayside with an uninspired and routine ending. They rushed through too many emotions in the film and seemed to be more concerned with time constraints than finishing the story they created. Despite that, HtTyD2 is one of a kind and garners more emotional and awe inspiring moments than The Hobbit has in two films.",1402876800,16,2534,4.711060948081264
6191345,4,B00HNH3HIU,"When How to Train Your Dragon went on to be a smash and rival Pixar's Toy Story 3 at the Oscars, it must have shocked Dreamworks Animation as much as it did everyone else. The studio had been around probably a lot longer than many thought, and for every creative and box office success like Shrek or Kung Fu Panda, there were numerous other retreads and copycats. Anybody remember MegaMind? Didn't think so. But sequels have proven especially difficult, with few ever coming close to matching the original. Does the string of bad luck continue with How to Train Your Dragon 2?

The answer is a resounding ""No"" as How to Train Your Dragon 2 is bigger and soars higher than the first and will undoubtedly be one of the year's best animated features. Dean DeBlois takes the directing reins solo this time, and rather than coasting along with what worked before he's expanded and evolved the 'Dragon' universe into someplace unpredictable and dangerous.

Five years have passed and Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is on a different sort of journey, one where he is literally charting a new world astride his dragon pal, Toothless. The rough-housing Viking village of Berk has changed more than Hiccup's slick new armor, with the townspeople living in peace with the dragons they once hated. Astrid (America Ferrera) is now firmly his woman, the people respect him (mostly), and now his father Stoic wants him to take over the role of Chief. Is he ready to handle that kind of responsibility? Does he even want to be Chief? Hiccup must again decide whether to be his own viking or follow in his father's footsteps.

The emotional throughline may be familiar, but honestly it's probably going to be a theme throughout the entire franchise, and it resonates due to a screenplay that throws many unexpected twists into the mix. On one of Hiccup's outings he encounters a group of dragon trappers led by the brash Eret (Kit Harington), who is ensnaring the creatures for Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou), a man building up an army. But while Drago's plans are for evil, Hiccup also encounters the mysterious Valka (Cate Blanchett), a hermit hidden away in an icy cave where she has created a dragon sanctuary of sorts. This isn't about changing the hearts and minds of the Berk people anymore, Hiccup must try and prevent full-scale war while also finding out the secrets to his past.

In some ways the film follows the typical path set by most follow-ups in that there are deeper questions, more characters, and bigger action in the 'Empire Strikes Back' mold. And that also means some of the humor slips into the background, or at least it seems to be relegated to Hiccup's pals (voiced by TJ Miller, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and more) who seem to be around only to appease younger viewers. That's not to say there aren't plenty of laughs, but this is definitely the dark middle chapter of a larger story, one where Hiccup again endures terrible and shocking loss that may be tough for younger audiences. We don't get to see nearly enough of Hiccup and Astrid as a couple, which would have made for a nice parallel with another romantic relationship rekindled in the film. More interesting and explored in greater detail is the bond between Hiccup and Toothless which is stronger than ever but still somewhat tenuous and easily manipulated. Drago, a villain of uncertain ethnic origin, is impressive only in his physical and mental dominion over pretty much everybody, but giving him a stronger motivation would have made an already-great film even better.

And of course the film is a visual stunner with aerial sequences that will take your breath away, and many of the dogfights (dragonfights?) have that Star Wars sizzle; you'd think they were piloting X-wing fighters. Even during the slower moments it's worth taking time to just soak up the surroundings and take in the lush colors and unique creature design. Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country for Old Men) had a hand in crafting the film's look and the result stands apart from anything we've seen from Dreamworks before. With heart and action to spare, How to Train Your Dragon 2 reaches incredible heights.",1402876800,5,4164,4.842696629213483
