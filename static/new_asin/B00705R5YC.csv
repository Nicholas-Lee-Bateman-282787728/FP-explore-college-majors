5045972,5,B00705R5YC,"A great DVD for the intermediate player. Sequences, substitutions with and against the chord, lots of examples well presented, and, most of all, it opens up yer brain and gets you thinking. Can't go wrong with this.",1343520000,,215,4.837837837837838
5045973,5,B00705R5YC,This is a concentrate bergonzy work. incredible video with exersise that work fo me. If you study that video deep you can change your improvisation. A really good work,1336953600,,167,4.793103448275862
5045974,5,B00705R5YC,"I bought both of the Jerry Bergonzi JazzHeaven Videos. These are the best instructional jazz videos I have seen. They present real, appliable techniques and devices. Expand on them as they go through the chapter, which shows a great working method for continued growth. And really cover enough material to get this style together. Also the audio and video quality is excellent. For anyone serious about learning how to speak this language, this is a great resource.",1330387200,,465,5.0519480519480515
5045975,5,B00705R5YC,"I have several of Bergonzi's 'Inside Improvisation' books and have found them extremely useful.  I consider them invaluable and some of the best instructional material on the market.  This DVD is very much like taking the best parts of the books and having Jerry teach them to you as though you were sitting with him, horn in hand.

This particular DVD focuses on taking simple ideas and expanding them into extremely complex sounding lines.  As you would expect from a master, Jerry explains all of the concepts in very easy-to-understand terms and there is plenty of actual playing by Jerry and his 'student' to reinforce the concepts.

The production and sound are extremely good.  All of the examples are included as a PDF on the DVD and they are also well done.

Overall, this DVD is well worth the money.  For about 1/2 of the cost of an actual private lesson, you get enough material for months and month.  Highly recommended for the intermediate to advanced musician.",1329868800,,975,4.790419161676646
5045976,5,B00705R5YC,"I have to admit, I've only made it through the first 40 mins into the second DVD.  After taking in all of the 1st DVD, I'm still digesting everything I've heard.  My playing has already been opened up and I'm moving past my usually approaches.  I've already got a ton to practice now!  I can't recommend this DVD enough for tenor players... or any jazz player that is looking to learn a little more about improving their improvising.  My favorite quote so far, ""you have to be like the piano player.  Those guys know everything that's going on, so you should too.""",1327104000,,564,4.480392156862745
8507548,4,B00705R5YC,"This CD is VERY helpful and definitely meets my expectations, the format, the exercises, the play a-longs, just a good CD.",1488412800,,122,4.857142857142857

8507553,5,B00705R5YC,Great concepts here! Well worth the $$. Jerry is a great player and a GREAT teacher!,1436486400,,84,4.3125
8507554,4,B00705R5YC,I purchased all three DVD's and found them a little over my head...I'll review them again at a later date.,1434412800,,106,4.35
8507555,5,B00705R5YC,its one of the best if not the best DVD instruction on the market.,1412553600,,66,3.7857142857142856
8507556,5,B00705R5YC,Vol1 was so good I wanted to continue. I own all the Bergonzi books and these videos give you a one-on-one insight to parts of them. Its really a nice complement to these books. I put the DVD in for only one topic and Im inspired to play. Thats the way I want a video lesson to work. This will keep me growing as a musician for many years to come. I like the shapes approach to playing sequences actually. I feel I am saying something more cohesively by stringing together these shapes and that the listener relates to them more easily even if they are harmonically more adventurous. Very cool.,1402790400,,594,4.36036036036036
8507557,5,B00705R5YC,"If you are a student of jazz improvisation, no matter what your instrument, and you are overwhelmed by all the jazz instructional material ""out there,"" start here!!! Jerry gives very specific instructions about how and what to practice. The main advantage of a video format is that you can see/hear the material demonstrated as if you were attending a lesson/masterclass. The demonstrations are excellent - very musical!
The material is presented in an extremely straight-forward manner and the video stays focused on the MOST IMPORTANT STUFF to practice. I teach woodwinds at Berklee College of Music and I use many of Jerry's ideas/methods with my own students. You can't go wrong purchasing Vol. 2 (and Vol. 1) in this series!!!

Jerry hit it out of the ball park with this one!

This is basically the same review that I wrote for the first video. While either video may be studied independently of the other, the second video is, to my way of thinking, a logical continuation of the first video, with more challenging material. There is enough here to keep an intermediate or advanced level student busy for a long, long time. I have a lot of fun practicing this stuff myself :-)
