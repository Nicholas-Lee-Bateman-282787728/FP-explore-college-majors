I've reported it and was surprised that I actually got feedback to address my concerns.  I'm still waiting for the replacements.",1447804800,,285,4.461538461538462

8523113,4,B007Y6QJWG,"I really like watching this teleseries.  I got it for my wife whose cousin is one of the directors for our wedding anniversary.  She always insists I watch it with her, which I was reluctant to at first because of the lack of english subtitles, as I do not speak/read tagalog.  But as she translates it for me, I'm really drawn into the story.  NO subtitles would be the only flaw in this otherwise excellent purchase.",1371340800,2,418,4.4605263157894735
