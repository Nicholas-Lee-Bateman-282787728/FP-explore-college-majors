8069491,4,B0009XFIMI,"Volume two of the super-cool, adrenaline-fueled ""Atomic Betty"" series has eight more episodes, which are ones that I also like.  (You'll notice that some of those episodes on the two DVDs are written by either Jono Howard or Mike Kubat; the same guys who wrote lots of episodes of another Cartoon Network series I also enjoy: ""Ed, Edd n Eddy"" !)

The episode ""Attack of the Evil Space Baby"", introduces the pugnacious Infantor, an alien toddler with a life of crime.  Many of the other episodes feature Betty's felonious nemesis, Maximus I.Q.  In one episode, Maximus throws a party with a rather hypnotizing dessert.  In another, he tries to make Betty into a grotesque work of art; and in yet another, he clones Betty into three superpowered Bettys that never seem to get along with each other.  (The real Betty busts a move at the end of this episode.  Too cool !)

Speaking of Maximus, he and his personal underling, Minimus P.U., discuss the trials and tribulations that is Atomic Betty in the special feature interview ""I Remember When"".  Typical bad guys.

In conclusion, this animated series will really draw your attention and sweep you off your feet.  It's definitely one of the coolest of the cool.",1135900800,3,1209,4.792270531400966
