8228909,5,B000XPF7VY,"I bought my copy online and was thrown at first when I discovered that it was a U.K. production in PAL with a Region 2 restriction.  For me, that was not a problem because I have a multi-region DVD player, but just keep that in mind.  A lot of young people push videos like this to their portable players (iPad's and such) after converting the DVD's to Mpeg (M4V for iTunes), so it doesn't matter to them, either.

Still, I am glad I bought this, because Billy Joel videos were the best productions of the late 1970's, 1980's and 1990's and this DVD has almost all of them.

It is a mystery to me why this isn't produced in our good 'ol U.S.A., but it just doesn't exist.",1321574400,,671,4.21875
