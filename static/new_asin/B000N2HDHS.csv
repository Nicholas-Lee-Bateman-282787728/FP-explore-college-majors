2753140,4,B000N2HDHS,"""An Unreasonable Man"" is not a pejorative description in the context of this film. One is reminded that the qualities that make an activist effective, are the same qualities of persistence and refusal to compromise that make such a person infuriating in other circumstances.

Although the first half of the documentary is devoted to Nader's rise as the country's premiere consumer advocate, the crux of the film is Nader's controversial presidential candidacy in 2000 and the personal, public and political ramifications of his decision to continue the race knowing that he may cost liberals a victory of the (arguably) more palatable candidate.

Unlike the reviewer below, I did not see in the film any agenda to trash Nader for running for president. When the movie moves its focus to Nader's effect on the 2000 election and whether he should have run under the circumstances, both sides of the argument get a fair airing. In fact, if anything, I felt the movie makers were inclined to the pro-Nader perspective--that for the politics of corruption to stop, a principled stand must be taken.

Regardless of the side of the debate one might take, the filmmakers did a an admirable job of showing through historical perspective why Nader ran, and why he was unapologetic about staying in the race. His personal history, from his experience with the Carter administration, the debate debacle, and his basic uncompromising personality and dogged pursuit of his goals, illuminate the motivations behind the 2000 Nader candidacy.

Although the filmmakers obviously hold Nader in high esteem, particularly for his crusades on behalf of consumers, this is a documentary in the true sense of the word--it is not a propaganda film, it it does not beat you over the head with the filmmakers' views. While, it is sympathetic to Nader's political positions and would not be considered ""balanced"" by a hardcore Republican, this is not a Michael Moore type of opus to any particular position. It is an expository film that raises but does not resolve the issue that alienated so many former Nader supporters.",1172448000,41,2095,5.063768115942029
2753141,3,B000N2HDHS,"This review was originally written for my political blog- American Left History. I have only slightly edited and expanded it here.

A documentary concerning the trials and tribulation of seemingly perennial presidential candidate and bourgeois gadfly Ralph Nader has just come out, oddly titled an ""Unreasonable Man"". Ordinarily I would not give a tinker's damn about reviewing such a film but a couple of points mentioned in the film have gotten me in a lather. Those who have been reading this space over the last year should be well aware that I hold not truck with the Green Party or for that matter Ralph Nader's run as an independent candidate in 2004. An alienated leftist (maybe?) candidacy in either form acting as a pressure on the Democratic Party to be `good' is not the strategy necessary for the times. That strategy might have at least made a little political sense in about 1912 (although Eugene V. Debs would have been my candidate then) but, dear readers, that is a very long political time ago. As for the defense of Nader, fair is fair and besides I have an ulterior motive here-listen up.

One of the film's themes is a free-for- all retroactive thrashing of Nader, mainly by liberal Democratic gurus, for allegedly getting George Bush elected in 2000. Apparently, Mr. Nader is thus responsible for everything that has happened since then from the invasion of Iraq to global warming to the failure of the Chicago Cubs to win a World Series. Grow up! And get over it! Part of the charm of bourgeois politics is the necessity for political amnesia. Let us refresh their memories. The Bush-Gore contest was a yawner. People literally could not tell them apart, at the time.

Moreover, while we are at it why blame Nader for the debacle in 2000? And here is my real point. Why not blame Bill Clinton for his scandal-ridden second term? Why not blame the flimsy anti-democratic Supreme Court ruling that stopped the count? Why not blame the Constitutional Conventioneers of 1787 who created that albatross anti- plebian Electoral College system? Lastly, why not blame Al Gore himself whose insipid campaign against a `light-weight' Bush candidacy drove even supporters to distraction? The point is, although this thought is wasted on the liberal gurus, that someone outside the two-party system should have the democratic right to run for any elective office he or she chooses. And that is what workers party advocates should take from this trashing of Nader. The two parties and their agents make it tough enough for third parties to have access to the electoral political process. Letting them get away with this cheapjack retro-bashing of Nader's right to stand for the presidency should not go unopposed. Enough said.

The rest of the documentary is about Nader's career as a consumer advocate and legal thorn in the side of the corporations. A fairer job is done there.  No rational person can do anything but tip his or her hat to those efforts. Consumers need all the protection they can get. As a strategy for social change, however, it leaves much to be desired. What is necessary is to organize at the point of production where there is power not at the atomized, indivdualistic point of consumption. But that is a fight to be led by others rather than Nader.",1172448000,13,3285,4.848484848484849

About a third of the way in, the evidence overwhelmingly points to many other facts that have been swept under the rug. The movie is, of course, in support of Nader, but the opposing viewpoints are presented too. If only I had known more about Nader in 2000.

How fantastic it would be if the conservatives were really conservative and the liberals were really liberal.  Everyone should watch this and know how are off track we have strayed.

2753153,4,B000N2HDHS,Very interesting documentary about a man sticking to what he believes in dispite mainstream politics. Another example of the diconect between government and the people they supposedly work for.,1393804800,,193,5.689655172413793
2753154,4,B000N2HDHS,"The important thing to remember about this documentary is that in 2000 Bush and Gore were fighting for the right to preside over business as usual in American government. No one saw 9/11 coming, so it was a question of a mindless alcoholic Republican who would probably have a 4-year Presidency in which nothing would be accomplished, against a lukewarm Democrat who would try to continue Clinton's fiscal policies and keep the country out of war. It was not a dramatic election like McCain versus Obama, when we were electing our first Black President.

With this in mind, there is no doubt that Ralph Nader wanted to hurt Gore. Nader sees both parties as inept and corrupt, would have been happy to see Gore unexpectedly lose -- all his protestations of impartiality to the contrary.

But there other factors that sunk Gore. The biggest one was Monica Lewinski, who stained the Clinton Presidency and forced Gore to run alone, without mentioning Clinton's name. It could easily be argued that Monica Lewinski put Bush in the White House.

Then there was Kathleen Harris and the State of Florida and the Supreme Court. This also contributed to sinking Gore.

Finally, Gore has a weak chin, a spineless way of speaking. There is an aura of weakness about him, despite all his fine qualities. This is to be compared to Richard Nixon's sweaty upper lip and emaciated appearance in the debates against Kennedy.

There were a lot of factors, Nader being one. But the biggest factor came after the election on 9/11, transforming Bush into a wartime President. The country has never recovered from Bush's military decisions (fed to him by Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz), and this is proved by the  humiliating fact that we are still in Afghanistan.

It could be argued that Nader, indirectly, contributed to this tragedy, but to call a spade a spade, it was Osama bin Laden who changed the face of America.

We will never know how Gore would have reacted to 9/11. That's why history is interesting: what did not happen is as inscrutable as what did happen.",1380412800,,2054,4.798866855524079
2753155,4,B000N2HDHS,"This is a good movie in that it shows the cruelty, corruption and evil of the Democratic party.  It has a ton of Bush-bashing, which as a proud American I resent.

2753160,5,B000N2HDHS,"This video was recently aired on television.  I knew the name, Ralph Nader, but never realized the importance of the man.  It is a  finely made documentary that helps to make us aware of our responsibilities as citizens of a once great nation that so many brave souls have given their life to preserve.  This is the sort of information that must be imparted to all Americans, whether on television or in the classroom to the young mind.  Being a citizen of a country is a responsibility, and part of that responsibility is to be vigilant and to not compromise or give in when we see and know something is amiss.  Another important documentary filmmaker is Ken Burns.  Both filmmakers make excellent historical documentaries which should be shown in schools.  What Ralph Nader worked for his entire life in fighting the giants in his day must not be taken for granted today - the giants are still with us and will always be lurking somewhere.  Civic responsibility is a job for all citizens.  Another great gift that I will certainly add to my list of items!

2753161,5,B000N2HDHS,"""An Unreasonable Man"", an authentic, touching documentary of former presidential candidate, Ralph Nader, proved to be far from unreasonable.  Viewers gain an inside track on Nader's personality, professionalism and passion through the course of his past 20 plus years of service as a whistle blower for consumer rights.  This documentary also shows Nader's strong moral convictions and passions to serve the American people, unafraid of challenging big business, big government and big politicians.  A striking contrast is made between the elite cartels and the little guy who often is over run with the need for companies to make profits.  After viewing ""An Unreasonable Man"", the average citizen can not help but become inspired by his heroic efforts to right the wrongs and acknowledge the many contributions made for the common good for consumers.  Perhaps a sequel for this ""Underdog"" will represent a more in-depth view of his ""Superman"" abilities to create some of the greatest gains to protect American citizens' health, welfare and safety.",1363305600,,1048,5.365853658536586
2753162,5,B000N2HDHS,"Sometimes think Ralph Nader has become a forgotten man, especially in this era of pandering, lies, and deliberate disinformation.

Politicians and mainstream media have simply ignored him into becoming a nonentity. Nader deserves recognition for his years of principled public service and his dedication to the meaning of citizenship in a true democracy.",1359849600,3,476,5.625
2753163,5,B000N2HDHS,"I am of a younger generation that only new Ralph Nader as ""the other guy"" during the presidential elections. This documentary did a great job of telling his story in an entertaining way. If your looking for a new role model...check it out.",1358208000,,239,4.5813953488372094
2753164,5,B000N2HDHS,"A remarkable story about a man's efforts, often thankless, fighting for the average American consumer in the face of corporate greed and indifference. Ralph stood in a league of his own. A man with unwavering ethics and courage. Advocating for justice and promoting civic responsibility. Watching this documentary not only highlights his accomplishments and his motivations, but also shows the corrupt system that often maligned the individual for his efforts in fighting for the welfare of his fellow citizens.

Though it was a shame (and heartbreaking) to see so many former supporters turn their back on a man who courageously stuck to his ideals, anyone wishing to be inspired and feel hopeful about the future need only look to individuals like Ralph Nader. For other great and inspiring figures, I recommend you check out Dr. Ron Paul, Glenn Greenwald, Judge Andrew Napolitano and Dan Carlin.",1357084800,,898,5.1931034482758625
2753165,5,B000N2HDHS,"I watch a lot of documentaries. This film is one of the best I have seen. What I think I enjoyed most and found the most fascinating was the non-stop juxtaposition of opinion about Ralph Nader coming from both those who are his admirers and detractors, and from Ralph Nader himself. The film does not have a narrator to advise the viewer to come to conclusions, but rather allows this continuous flow of opinion to narrate. The portrait of Ralph Nader that emerges is a fascinating one. It was also very interesting how the film looks at his Presidential bid of 2000 and the negative fallout, and charges that he was a spoiler that cost Gore the election. I found the evidence presented that he was not a spoiler to be quite compelling, even as it was presented alongside opinion from those who maintain a sense animosity toward Ralph Nader for running. A great film.

2753169,5,B000N2HDHS,"Ralph Nader is my hero - you should know this if you read this review.  This film  features both those folks who continued to support him after his runs for president and those who abandoned him.  In some cases you see before and afters.

I first saw this film when it came out and bought a copy for myself to see again and share with others. It is a wonderful look at a principaled person who walks the talk.  I especially like a scene where he is denied access to a presidential debate even though he had a ticket.  His respect toward the police who bars his way was amazing - he never let anger cloud his behavior and he understood the officer was a pawn, not a decision-maker.

The film features interviews with with people who have broken with Nader over the years so I think it presents a balanced view.  But in truth, I think so highly of Nader that I might be biased - to me, he soars above his detractors, answering to a higher calling - a life serving justice - and the film led me to the conclusion that he has placed this higher calling above everything else - even personal relationships and friendships.",1327708800,,1117,4.311004784688995
2753170,5,B000N2HDHS,"To this date there is no better political documentary than this one. Like him or not, Nader has had an extraordinary impact on all our lives in ways few are aware. It is hard to image anyone working more intensely on making the world a better place.

This documentary goes further than just Nader, however. Through Nader's story, you see the extreme corruption in the US political system. This includes horrendous ballot access laws, corporate influence, the charade called the presidential debates, and the spineless media. For this naked view, everyone needs to see this documentary. That means both liberals and conservatives. I show this documentary to everyone I can. And they are always amazed.

I love documentaries. I've watched hundreds of them and I still count this one as my favorite.",1325462400,4,796,5.0227272727272725
2753171,5,B000N2HDHS,"I was very much inspired with indignation for our political system by this video, not to rebellion but participation and activism. I was cheering to finally hear someone demand that we should vote our principles rather than make politics as insignificant as a team sport by supporting party politics.

It was never so obvious to me than it is in this video, the power of information, the media. It is seldom that you get to hear the candid criticisms and responses of both sides in the same forum that has not been manipulated by agenda so much as to disguise the truth by either lies or omissions. I enjoyed the refreshingly candid and open responses about Mr. Nader's motives. I see now how much a circus is popular reporting and the shallowness of the political debates in general.

Ralph Nader's story is a fine example of the difficulties it is to participate in one's communities without participating in party politics and how this consolidation of power has corrupted and far removed our leaders are from any sincere national dialog. He reveals through his personal experiences how unjust and manipulated is our political profession remains.

We need more serious dialog. Let it out!",1319846400,,1191,4.8861386138613865

The actions of our government since 2000 have shown that integrity and public service are archaic ideas to them and many generations will have to pay for these crimes.

At the end of the day, each of us is alone with our conscience, and he has always faced his unflinchingly, unlike the rest of us.

He is a profound, brilliant and great man.  Flawed only in that many view his unwillingness to compromise as a weakness.  We need more people with such flaws getting into the governance of this country again.

  Now a word about Ralph Nader. If only people in this country realized how much this man did for them they would be amazed. He is responsible for all the car safety that we have today which probably saves 50,000 lives a year. The people that you voted against him for president are responsible for distroying hundreds of thousand of lives by lieing to us. He's also responsible for most of the consumer protection laws we have today, most of which have been distroyed by the republicans. He came up with answers to todays problems that the American people are two stuppid to listen to. I could go on and on. Ralph Nader is ""An Unreasonable Man"" and we would be a lot worst off if he never existted. He is truly my only hero. Buy this tape and some of his books and you will be enlightened. Also watch some of his stuff on ""youTube"". He is truly a great man. Which is more than I can say about anyone we have elected to the presidency since Lincoln. Oh yea, I highly recommend this DVD.

Despite my sarcasm, there are a lot of documentaries about individual people and that person is never interviewed during said documentary (understandable if it is about a historical figure who is no longer with us). Mr. Nader is actually in this.

No matter what people's opinion is on his politics, Ralph Nader is a legend as an advocate for your regular consumer. He went after the auto industry, news stations, and a whole host of corporations that he viewed as wronging the consumer.

This documentary really gets into why Nader ran for president, his background as a political activist, his reasoning, and his own personal background. The filmmaker didn't just focus on making Nader look good either. He interviewed and brought in perspectives from people on both sides of the fence. It's really a good, all-around look.

I don't know that the title is really fitting. Nader is called ""unreasonable"" but I think he is more ""unbending"" as in he is not interested in compromise but in doing what is right and necessary no matter what. I think that's admirable.",1278547200,2,1169,4.864321608040201

This isn't about money, glory, or self-aggrandizement. It is a story about a man who fought a long, hard, and lonely battle against the world's most powerful people almost single-handedly.

2753177,4,B000N2HDHS,"This is a warts-and-all biography of Ralph Nader, a hero to many for his longtime consumer activism and battles with corporations and a pariah to some for his political campaigns. The film moves chronologically through his early life, his work on safety issues with cars and other products, the founding of the nonprofit advocacy organization Public Citizen, his involvement with the Carter Administration, his disillusionment with the major parties during the Reagan years, and his stubborn and ultimately futile quests for the presidency.

I come away from the film with the view that Nader must be counted one of the most important and idealistic Americans in the history of our country, but at the same time a person who unfortunately did not understand, and still does not understand, the value of compromise. He is a bullheaded machine, consumed by his efforts on behalf of social justice to such an extent that he has virtually no personal life and almost completely disregards the consequences of these battles.

To accuse Nader of singlehandedly costing the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections for the Democratic candidates is far too simplistic. Both Gore and Kerry ran terrible campaigns. The blame, in the end, must be distributed much further: to the media, which treats elections as entertainment; to political parties, which tightly control who is allowed to speak and what they are permitted to say; and to the American people, who have proved themselves tragically uninformed and shortsighted as to the responsibilities of citizenship, the dangers of fiscal and military recklessness, and the lasting effects of poor electoral choices.

The clips of Nader's public life from the 1960s through the 2000s are well-chosen, as are the interview subjects: Nader himself, his closest associates, and his fiercest critics. All are allowed to speak freely about the man; the filmmakers evidence no overt bias toward or against him. Interviews could have been more tightly edited, however, so as to make a shorter, more effective production. For political junkies, the bonus disc includes nearly two hours of additional interviews on the subjects of leadership, Nader's agenda, third parties, Democrats and Republicans, the Iraq War, and corporate power.

A fine documentary overall. Recommended.",1237680000,5,2305,5.341597796143251
2753178,5,B000N2HDHS,"Disc 2 is worth the price alone. Special Features on disc 2 include: Profile of a Charismatic Leader, What Kind of President Would Ralph Nader Be? and Debating the Role of Third Parties in the U.S. Influential professor of psychology at Harvard Howard Gardner, along with former associates-""Nader's Raders"", and others offer insights. John Gartner, author of ""The Hypomaniac Edge"", says Nader has hypomania. He explains it is not a disorder but a rare temperament and one feature of this condition is the need for less sleep and ability to work at high levels of energy for extremely long periods of time. Gardner says Nader is like Freud in that he wasn't simply the best or most successful you-name-it of his generation (actor, lawyer, novelist, etc.) he was the creator of a new ""sphere"". The sphere created was consumer activism and each and every American as well as people throughout the world have greatly benefited.

The full lenth film fully covers the very long and and almost unbelievably productive career of Ralph Nader from his early battle with GM and their death-trap car all the through to his presidential campaigns. Whether you love him or hate him this is an excellent documentary and should be seen by anyone with an interest in our country, which like one review says should be everyone.

Critics do have there say although they surely would feel they needed more time. Perhaps several hours to complain. Former 60s activist Todd Gitlin mockingly dismisses Nader as ""the knight on a white horse"". Eric Alterman whines,""Thank you Ralph Nader for George Bush"", ""Thank you Ralph Nader for..."" and he repeats this, each time thanking Nader for everything that is wrong now. (When I say whines I mean whines.) Ralph Nader--What springs to mind for you when you hear the name Ralph Nader? I was thinking of what comes to the mind of most Democrats. Lol. Maybe his life confronts us with the eternal conflict between principal and pragmatism. Or realism and idealism. But whatever. I feel like whining myself. I've been paying some attention the realistic, pragmatic Democratic Party. They've accomplished nothing but sucking especially since Bill Clinton. The Democratic Congress elected in '06 has received lower approval ratings than ""the worst president in history""! And they should. I honestly cannot believe what a bunch of two-faced, lying, cowardly snakes make up that corrupt corportist party that at very best is *sometimes* the lesser of two evils, but evil nonetheless. So thank you Democrats! And I *hope* the new great man *changes* things but other than looking smart and speaking well, it's looking about as deep as a makeover for an old who-e.",1230940800,7,2675,4.995515695067264
2753179,4,B000N2HDHS,"An Unreasonable Man paints a picture of its subject, consumer advocate and candidate Ralph Nader, which is neither flattering nor vilifying. Rather directors Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan  chooses to paint a picture of Nader that captures this remarkable man warts and all. Focusing on Nader's ""rise and fall"" in a chronological order with occasional personal interludes.

 The compelling narrative presented is Nader's single mindedness. Like Don Quixote, Nader is portrayed as a man with a will of steal. The documentary focuses on how this drive which has for years pushed his efforts to success, would later lead him to chase windmills that he couldn't defeat, those of the American political system.

 The documentary seems largely aimed reclaiming Nader's pre-candidacy legacy as a legislative reformer fighting for the American consumer. The bulk of the film focuses here. Telling of how Nader build one of the largest consumer rights organization in the history of the nation, the documentary at the same time touches on how the founding of progressive groups led to the founding of their counterparts.  The film does however take small steps at reclaiming the legacy of his campaign, presenting an array of arguments for and against his campaigns in 2000 and 2004. The most interesting point is an interview with the author of an American Political Science Association Article looking at Nader's impact on the 2000 election.

 An Unreasonable Man, is a compassionate portrait, while it takes great strides towards being objective, its sentimentality still leaks through. Like its subject, the film is compelling, warts and all. An Unreasonable Man is 2hrs. 1min. Long, and is not rated, although there is no nudity, sex, and little, if any, profanity.",1229472000,,1765,5.2562277580071175
2753180,5,B000N2HDHS,"This film deserves every accolade it has received.  It's probably the best documentary I've seen in the last 5 years, and man have I seen some documentaries.  It is thought-provoking whenever it doesn't succeed at entertaining, and vice-versa.

This biopic does many things, deceptive and otherwise.  Firstly, Nader is somehow made out to seem like a regular human, when, from other interviews, you can clearly tell he is a space alien sent as some sort of social experiment, possibly to see how long it takes for us to notice.  Second of all, it reveals the unalloyed vitriol that Nader is forced to withstand, from Democratic partisans and other less-than-stable elements of the populace.  Note to Democrats: the people who helped ruin the election chose between a guy with no chance and your party, what does that tell you?  Eric Alterman is particularly repugnant, frothing at the mouth with venomous personal enmity in between miniature paroxysms.

The movie also makes some excellent points about American democracy, sometimes discreetly, sometimes more overtly, such as when Nader is being escorted away by police, despite having a valid pass to watch the debate between Bush and Gore.  Good thing they stopped that crime before it was ever committed!  A slightly unnerving vignette, to say the least.

If anything you'll see that Nader is essentially a decent guy, even if he is from another dimension, and in spite of some outlandish and sometimes not particularly coherent political beliefs.  While I don't quite agree he fits the description of G.B. Shaw's quote from which the film takes its name, I'm certainly convinced he's a worthy subject for a documentary.",1226793600,4,1674,5.091575091575091

I thought our big corporations were run by the best and the brightest our country had to offer.  Then came the disasters at Enron and WorldCom.  Now we have a sub-prime mortgage melt-down.  So I investigated the flip side of the picture: Ralph Nader.

I had not realized he had done so much good for Americans.  I had not known that he sued General Motors for harassment and won.

I wondered how John Kerry managed to throw away his chance to defeat Bush, then I saw this documentary and Ralph Nader described what he suggested to Kerry and I found myself saying, ""Yes, I would have voted for Kerry if he had done as Nader suggested.""  The people running the Democratic party are brain-dead.  It was amazing to see Nader understanding what it took to defeat Bush while John Kerry was clueless.

This documentary was one surprise after another.  The biggest shock was seeing Pat Buchanan, who had worked in the White House for Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, saying on camera that ""democracy in America is a fraud.""  Watch this documentary and you will see why Buchanan might say that.

I have been reading the New York Times regularly since I was a teen-ager.  I am now middle-aged and finding out that we need to work hard to be well informed.

When you walk out of the theater, Bush is still president and our government is still lead by a bunch of corporate whores.

This is the same circle of futility which, coincidentally, we watch Ralph Nader spin in during the movie.  The voice of reason and sanity, speaking for the people, yet branded as a radical and fringe lunatic.  What hope do we have?  Do we keep doing the same thing hoping for a different response?

As for the cowardly, whiny Democrats in this film whom crucify Nader, they sicken me. It isn't Ralph Nader's fault that 49% of American's wanted more of the Bush regime.

Nader has been a tireless and selfless champion of liberal values.  His integrity is unquestionable.  Then in 2000 he ran for President.  Democrats, instead of embracing Nader, turned on him.  This documentary does a good job of examining why this happened and how it may affect Nader's legacy.

This documentary also exposes the complacency and sometimes even complicity of Democrats in allowing Republicans to dismantle decades-worth of liberal programs which were designed to protect Americans.  But most imporantly, it illustrates clearly that we are barely living in a Democracy.  As Nader would say, ""Democracy is weak right now.""  It will have to gain a lot of strenth before it can overtake the oligarchy that has high-jacked this once free nation.

But this documentary also left me feeling optimistic.  Just as the national zeitgeist swung in favor of the Reagan Revolution in the late 70s, I left this documentary feeling that change was in the air.

In particular, the portrayal of the Hollywood stars who voted for him in 2000 and then begged him not to run in 2004 was excellent.  The film includes excellent sound bites from major academics who were angered with Nader as well as Nader supporters who felt the Dems were the scum of the earth.

2753193,4,B000N2HDHS,"As a plaintiff's attorney I have always been fascinated with the career of citizen advocate Ralph Nader. He has been involved in the creation of some of the most important legislation of the 20th Century: the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Highway Safety Act and on and on. He has been the protector of citizens and consumers with the push for mine safety, safe foods, airbags and seatbelts. It is a shame that his legacy has been tarnished by two unsuccessful runs for President in which he has been called a spoiler by the Democratic Party. If anything Nader always worked within the Democratic arena.

Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan's documentary chronicles the life and career of Nader. It is a film that attempts to present a balanced view of the man's life by presenting interviews with both friends and foes. If there is an issue it seems to be that the film makes its character a little too heroic but this is a minor flaw.

The first part of the film deals with the consumer protection work Nader did in his golden years at Dupont Circle. We view a young Nader as he goes after and wins battles with General Motors on auto safety. We witness the drive and idealism of Nader's Raiders as they take on the corporate giants.

The second half of the film starts with the infamous theory that there is not a dime's worth of difference between the modern Republican and Democratic Parties. If there is to be a change in the country for the better it must come from within the democratic process. This part of the film tells of the two failed runs for president and gives itself over to opinions of whether Nader did what he dis for the good of the counrty or whether he simply acted as an election spoiler costing Al Gore the Presidency.

The film allows the viewer to make his or her own choices concerning his legacy and hid role as an unlikely hero.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Nader fought zealously for the rights of consumers on specific matters, leading to specific changes to fix specific problems.  He investigated issues, got the word out, and in many cases the public recognized that there ought to be a law.  The government acted, and we consumers have benefited from safer cars, seat belts, air bags, and much more, as the film mentions.

By the late 1970s, consumers came to trust Nader and people like him, and corporations took notice.  Watch this film to see how corporations responded, including personal smear campaigns.  Watch how the Republican Party responded to corporate interests, and how the Democrats responded when they saw corporations donating money to the other guys.  In 2000 and 2004, why didn't Nader just support whatever Democrats were nominated?

If any single individual can be said to have influenced the outcome of an election, it would have to be Ralph Nader.  And if any one person can be credited with saving thousands of lives through the actions he's performed and the stands he's taken, well that would be Ralph Nader too.

After decades as the world's premiere consumer advocate and all-around corporate gadfly, Nader should, in the sunset of his life, be basking in the glow of unalloyed adulation, a shiny symbol of hope and courage for the common man in this country.  Instead, he finds himself a figure more reviled than revered by those who should love him most.

The documentary ""An Unreasonable Man"" attempts to explore the reason for this mystifying love/hate dichotomy.  Filmmakers Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan trace the path of Nader's life beginning with his childhood in Connecticut, where he was raised by his socially-conscious parents to champion fairness and the cause of the little guy, to his eventual career as the populist activist par excellence, taking on corporate behemoths in the name of consumer safety.  The movie chronicles the run-ins with GM that turned Nader into not only a household name but clearly ""one of the most admired men in America.""  We see him inspiring a band of college students - who came to be known as ""Nader's Raders"" - who successfully took on any number of corporate giants throughout the 1960's and 1970's, resulting in many of the consumer protection laws we take so much for granted today.  He was clearly a pioneer in his field, and the movie is an inspiring tribute to the selflessness, determination and courage that helped this one man make such a difference in the world (the movie reminds us that before Nader even seatbelts were not standard items in automobiles).

It's with the coming of the Reagan Revolution in the 1980's that Nader began to become severely disillusioned, as he watched the new conservative administration, hostile to the very principle of governmental protectionism, dismantle many of the programs Nader had dedicated his life to setting up.  But his disillusionment did not extend merely to Republicans.  For it was at this point that Nader began to claim that there wasn't a ""dime's worth of difference"" between the Republicans and Democrats, a realization that compelled him to finally run in 2000 as a Presidential candidate on the Green Party ticket.  The rest, of course, is history, with many Democrats, some formerly close friends of Nader, choosing to blame their fallen idol for Gore's squeaker loss in Florida (and, consequently, the nation) on that fateful election night.

Although ""An Unreasonable Man"" presents Nader in a generally flattering light, it does not shy away from the very genuine anger Nader's actions have aroused in many of his former followers.  Many blame him for ensuring Bush's victory and, thus by extension, for eight years of what they would describe as appalling Republican leadership.  Others take a more philosophical view, worrying more about how all this might taint the very impressive legacy Nader built up over many decades of tireless social activism.  In true maverick style, Nader pooh-poohs this concern, claiming that fighting for people is what he truly cares about, not how he will be viewed by future generations.  The movie provides many opportunities for Nader's faithful supporters to have their say, as well, so we get a fascinating debate about whether ideological purity or steely-eyed pragmatism should be the key factor in determining one's vote in a presidential election.  One of the most interestingly ironic moments in the film comes when we see Michael Moore, who is usually the one doing the sandbagging in his own films, being sandbagged himself as he is shown flip-flopping on his support for Nader between the 2000 election where he spoke at Nader rallies and the 2004 election where he pleads with Nader not to run.

Even people who are still embittered by Nader's role in the 2000 election may find themselves softening in their attitude towards him a bit after watching this film.  The movie certainly reminds us of the great debt of gratitude we owe him as a nation, and, even when he is at his most obstinate in the political realm, we sense that he is being that way for ideologically honest reasons, not out of ego or malice.  It's awfully hard not to find oneself cheering him on as he attempts to force his way into the audience for one of the 2000 presidential debates, after he and all the other independent candidates had been officially banned from the premises.

""An Unreasonable Man"" provides a generous helping of archival footage to go along with the passionate interviews on both sides of the Nader spectrum (the movie does not, however, provide any real conservative voices, except for Patrick Buchanan, who, on many issues is actually more aligned with Nader's positions than opposed to them).

Love him or loathe him, this is a fantastically interesting and informative documentary about one of the most influential figures of the last hundred years.",1186531200,5,5102,4.982332155477032

2753205,5,B000N2HDHS,"OK I admit it, I voted for Nader in the 2000 election. I knew he had no chance of winning. But here he was, an actual presidential candidate, saying all the things I believed in. He wasn't just another phony politician. But a dedicated longtime advocate of economic and social justice. He was anti-war, for universal health care and even supported the legalization of certain drugs - something no Democrat would ever do.

Back then I was in my early 30's, old enough to have grown more than a bit cynical about politics. But somehow Nader did it, he bought back the idealistic aspirations of my activist youth. He was my guy and I also believed that Nader's getting more than 5% of the vote would help build the Green Party, the only political party that had ever supported the issues I most cared about. Certainly the last 8 years of Bill Clinton hadn't brought dramatic changes for the better in American life. So I took a leap of faith and I voted for him.

Then reality hit. Not only did he get less than 5% of the vote but Bush won (or rather stole) Florida by such a tiny margain that everyone blamed Nader for Bush's victory. Then, without him as their candidate, the Green Party faded into obscurity again. Bush started the disastrous war in Iraq and his countless other idiotic decisons that has led to perhaps the worst presidency in American history. Nader got the blame for all of this.

But this documentary doesn't set out to bash Nader or to glorify him. Instead it tells his life story, from his boyhood days in Connecticut to the present. The first half of the movie traces his rise from bright Harvard Law School graduate to leader of the consumer movement. It tells about his legendary and successful struggle to improve automobile safety and how from there he went to on play a significant role in important legislation such as the Clean Air and Clean Water acts. This part of the movie is a bit like Nader's early career, very detailed oriented and a bit mundane but still worth watching.

From an entertainment aspect, the film certainly picks up once Nader enters politics. The scenes from his campaign rallies, especially the big one in New York, helped remind me why I was so inspired by him to begin with. There is no question that both the Republicans and Democrats are so beholden to corporate interests that no meaningful social change is going to come from either of them. Whether it was the abolitionist movement, the women's movement or the civil rights movement, it has always been activists who have led the progressive movements in American society and politicians who have, often reluctantly, followed. In most other Western democracies they have parliamentary political systems where minority parties are at least given a voice. But in America's ""winner take all"" system it seems unlikely that the Greens, or any other third party, will ever break through to electoral viability. That's an unfortunate fact of American life.

So in 2008 I will likely vote for Hillary, Obama or whoever the Democrats nominate. Yes Nader was, and is, an ""unreasonable man"". His quixotic campaigns for the presidency may have, especially in 2000, led to horrendous results. But I like to take the long view and the truth remains that it takes these sort of sincere, dedicated  ""unreasonable"" people to create a better future for all of us. Maybe the dirty, ruthless world of electoral politics is not the place for them. But I still respect and admire Nader. He will probably be remembered by history as one of the more important figures of late 20th century American society and this movie about his life is balanced and highly recommended.",1183766400,7,3659,4.745283018867925
2753206,3,B000N2HDHS,"...what a schmuck.

And what a shame that one of the greatest consumer activists in this nation's history has brought that harsh historical judgement upon himself. Nader's egotistical insistence on playing the political boogieman/conscience/scold of the Democratic Party, elevating his own priorities above all else, even at the expense of -- gasp -- winning elections and countering a highly organized Republican assault on democracy, is a dismal historical tragedy.  A man who was a great hero in the 1960s and '70s has long since tarnished his own legacy, and this movie reveals some of that hubris and myopia. Alas.",1183507200,5,619,5.242424242424242
2753207,3,B000N2HDHS,"For as dull and fraudulent as our democracy is the story of late Ralph Nader is sure juicy. And it is one in my mind that has only become cloudier and cloudier over the past seven years as I have watched my own politics slider further and further left. For all I knew Nader appeared out of thin air back in 1999 with the simple goal our destroying the future of this country by delivering the upcoming election to the biggest evil doer ever to run for public office. I am a proud Gore and Kerry voter (in the swing state of Michigan) but now, especially after this thought provoking documentary, I wonder how in the right I actually was. Nader is a man who believes most everything I believe. He is for justice and against corporations. He will stand up to the powers that be and refuse to be intimidated. He has the political courage I wish I had. But then again I don't just write myself in at the ballot box when I go to vote because you can't have it all.

The film covers pretty much his entire career using the usual techniques for new age documentary filmmaking. We have clips borrowed from the press edited together to create an over arching image of the man in question. There are also the talking heads broken into the somewhat hardened camps of for and against. Former co-workers of his give him glowing reviews and echo his talking points whereas detractors such as Eric Alterman go so far as to label him ""psychotically disturbed."" As a huge bonus for the film Nader himself gets tons of face time where he gives you his typical no nonsense stance on the issues in his articulate, intelligent way. Directors Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan do seem to play it fairly objectively with a slight bias in favor of Mr. Nader. They do seem to be building towards an argument of whether his earlier consumer advocacy good fight outweighs his throwing of the 2000 election towards George W. Bush and the ensuing war (If you are comfortable laying all that at his feet, I am not). At over two hours the film does feel a little bulky; of course I'm not telling them that they need to shed minutes, rather that a little tightening never hurt anybody.

Some of the clips are a real treat to watch. I loved the feeling of being simultaneously being inspired and infuriated as Nader undresses the scrub fuzz ordered to keep him out of the Presidential debates. Or how about when Nader labeled the American staple hot dogs as ""missiles of death""? It's pure gold. Phil Donahue may actually make the best point as he discusses the ways in which the Democrats behavior from 2000-2004 proved Nader's argument that they are the same thing as the Republicans. Nader himself also seems quite profound as he refers to personal loyalty as an ""indulgence"", especially now that we are living in a post-""Heckuva job Brownie"" world. If you have no sympathy for Nader and his point of view then you probably won't like this movie. I do so I enjoyed. It is conventional to the core but its knotty subject matter alone carries it to the promise land. ***1/2",1183507200,22,3041,4.527272727272727
2753208,5,B000N2HDHS,"Having lived through the outrages of the Bush years, one wonders how history will judge these times.  And this excellent documentary amounts to a meditation on this subject played out in terms of Nader's own legacy.  The documentary starts as an homage to Nader's selfless public advocacy and then rolls up its sleeves and mucks through the question of ""Ralph the spoiler.""  And even though we're often just seeing talking heads, there's something almost operatic about the drama.  To see some of Ralph's original Rader's struggling with a deep sense of betrayal, to see the ire of his critics -- it's very compelling.  The documentary tries to be even-handed, but ultimately amounts to an apologia.  Nonetheless, one is left to make up one's own mind.",1182643200,19,752,4.976
2753209,5,B000N2HDHS,"A welcome documentary on an iconic American activist which brings viewers up-to-date on the myriad  and varied accomplishments Ralph Nader has brought forth through his political and organizational efforts.  It also is a reflection of the times in which this film was produced.  Nader has been marginalized by the mainstream media, and for too many, Nader is known primarily as someone who had the both the temerity and tenacity to provide the electorate with a real alternative to the two presidential candidates - candidates who had simplified and dumbed down the national issues.  For this he has been roundly denounced  for being a 'spoiler.'  Ironic, since we live in a country which normally reveres competition as a way to improve both business and politics.
This documentary is a fascinating and informed look at a man who came into prominence in the idealistic 60's and continues to live out his ideals to encourage  a too-often complacent and cynical public to get involved and actually participate in making democracy work.
This film serves as a Rorshach test - for those who resent Nader's activism, there are plenty of clips of disgruntled and disillusioned former Nader supporters and employees,  who will reflect some viewers' own disenchantment.  But for others, the film serves as a great reminder that Nader has not given up his ideals or his non-stop work ethic, even in an age where corporations largely call the shots due to a largely self-centered, compliant, and dumbed-down public.
This 2-DVD set also includes talking-heads featurettes, the best being:  'Profile of a charismatic leader' which explores Nader's unusual and vast intellect and drive; and 'Debating the role of third parties in the US', a look back on how 3rd parties have profoundly influenced the 2 major parties throughout American history and how difficult it is for 3rd parties to successfully run due to rigged election laws.
I also recommend Ralph Nader's recent book on  the fine values his Lebanese immigrant parents instilled in their 4 children, and how these values profoundly influenced their activism and commitment in making this world a better place for future generations:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seventeen-Traditions/dp/0061238279/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seventeen Traditions</a>.",1181779200,8,2349,5.551820728291316
2753210,5,B000N2HDHS,"This documentary is a must watch! It is about Nader's fight for genuine democracy, his struggle against a corrupt establishment, and his battle for accountability in government.

Taking the establishment head-on is a dangerous task. It is biblical that you don't challenge the old order; otherwise you will be banished from the Garden of Eden or be crucified. Nader was crucified many times because he dared to tell the truth and confront this old order.

Nader remains unco-opted, incorruptible, and a thorn in the side of the establishment. Unlike our Washington politicians he is never for sale, and will continue to stand for the little people as an icon of truth and integrity.

Nader dedicated his life to fight for a democracy of the people, by the people and for the people (not ""from the Exxon, by the General Motors, and for the Dupont""). He will remain a guiding torch for ethics, integrity, and true democracy.

This documentary about this great man is must watch. Rent it, go to the theaters to see it, or buy it!!!",1178841600,9,1028,4.790960451977401
2753211,5,B000N2HDHS,This is an amazing film about an amazing man. Contrary to what the first reviewer below claims the film does an excellent job of presenting a case in favor of Nader. Both sides are given time and once the facts are out one can really only come to one conclusion. All Nader detractors are given air time and certainly don't hold back. The film does a great job of covering a man's entire life in 2 hours. I look forward to the extras on this disc.,1175904000,13,446,4.1976744186046515

8174248,5,B000N2HDHS,"I have always admired Ralph Nader's endless and  untirering fight against injustice. However, after he continued to run third party after 2000, I even started to question his motives. After watching the 2016 election unfold with the DNC doing everything to prevent a true populist from rising in their ranks then gaslighting voters into supporting a candidate who in more ways than one gave every progressive voter the middle finger (choosing one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress as VP, giving DWS a job, etc.) and guaranteed more of the status quo, I'm finally waking up to what Ralph Nader's had known all along: the two party system is owned by corporate interests and no one is going to change that by backing down because the other party might be worse. This documentary lays out what took me 20 years to figure out and shows the malice and foly of those who lay blame on Ralph Nader instead of the Democrats who sold out long ago.

I ended up crying for 20 minutes after watching in despair over the direction of out country and the hate a true hero has gotten for changing that course positively in many ways. But I also cried because an immigrant's son from modest means rose to be someone considered the number one threat to American plutocracy. And that means there is still hope.",1482796800,4,1304,4.665217391304348
