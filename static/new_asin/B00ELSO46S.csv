8606746,3,B00ELSO46S,"This is really a low budget drama that is short on historical content or accuracy, although finding anything from this period of Mongolian History would be about impossible.  Few records were kept and only legends seem to exist.  Some of the acting is very good and some is atrocious.  Modu's ""Army of 10,000"" is represented by about a dozen guys on horseback who in one shot are 10-12 year old children, and miraculously they've become grown men a moment later.  After reading the Wikipedia article a couple of other pieces on the web about King Modu I had enough information to almost follow what was happening on screen.  Without that I'd never have understood it even remotely.  I got the impression that this was a piece done by a regional tourist bureau although I did find it mildly interesting.",1416009600,,802,4.733812949640288
