8331959,1,B001P42Y9U,"A most perplexing and unbelievable movie.  How a character like Penelope Cruz plays could go for and old, misguided, and dud of a professor as she does is beyond me.  The story drags on at times but does have a few redeeming moments, but I would not recommend this movie either for it's story or for it's entertainment value.  If you just want eye candy, Penelope provides that, and I'm thinking that's what they really are selling here. Without her and her ""assets"" being shown, I highly doubt this movie would have grossed a million.  Don't bother.",1381104000,,550,4.639175257731959
8331960,4,B001P42Y9U,"ELEGY was adapted by Nicholas Meyer from Philip Roth's novel, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dying-Animal/dp/0307454886/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dying Animal</a>.""

The film is a relentlessly melancholy story of an aging college professor who has an affair with a girl almost 40 years his junior. Hopper is fine in an atypically subdued supporting role, but he dies, and Cruz gets breast cancer. It's well-done and acted yet very difficult to sit through, especially if you're in need of some escape. Recommended, with reservations.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.

8331961,5,B001P42Y9U,"When I saw this movie - which in itself was not an easy task because it was relegated to obscure theaters at inconvenient times - only six other people were present.  Clearly this movie was not made with popular appeal in mind. No guns, no CGI, no well-cued schtick and obvious dialog.  Just stunningly acute direction and acting that takes the breath away.

I have never seen a film containing so much pain yet so beautifully delivered.  Kingsley and Cruz turn in exquisite performances, though of course Kingsley dominates as the eternally commitment-shy academic David. It is a testimony to Kingsley's power as an actor that he enables us first to feel sympathy with David's desire to seduce his student, and then sympathy with his moral and emotional equivocation, and finally sympathy with the utter devastation that comes from the loss of his beloved.

Aside from the scenes in which David interacts with his estranged son - scenes that really could have been deleted without harming the film in any way - there is never a spare moment.  This is a movie about isolation, loneliness and desire - the desire for contact, connection, and ultimately for hope.  It is spare, terse, and under-stated.  Unfortunately we do not live in a time when these virtues are appreciated, and many professional reviews have been very wide of the mark with their myopic criticisms.

The direction of the movie is light and assured, a million miles from the heavy-handed journey-work of most directors.  Nothing is over-emphasized.  Kingsley turns in what must be one of the top two or three performances of his career.  The movie assumes an intelligent audience - perhaps the reason why so few people have actually seen it, and why fewer still have appreciated its richness.  But for anyone who enjoys film-making at its very best, this is a must-have for the DVD or BlueRay collection.",1221955200,37,1873,4.889240506329114
8331962,5,B001P42Y9U,"The movie was FANTASTIC to say the very least!  A true must see film.  Performances were great...along with a great script and directing.  If this film doesn't move you, then there is something wrong.  A true take on the process of aging and impact it has on life decisions and happiness.",1220659200,5,288,4.588235294117647
8331963,2,B001P42Y9U,"Based on a novel by Philip Roth, this 2008 film is the story of an aging professor, the young student he falls in love with and a lot of complications.  Ben Kingsley is as the professor.  He is divorced, sophisticated and experienced in the ways of seducing women.  Penelope Cruz is the object of his affection.  She falls in love with him but he remains distant and doesn't want to get involved too deeply.  Dennis Hopper is the professor's friend and confident and even though he has been married for a lifetime, he still has his flings. Patricia Clarkson is an old flame of the professor's.  She shows up sporadically in the professor's life for a few romantic hours.  And then there is the professor's grown son, Peter Sarsgaard, with marriage problems of his own.

The theme is there.  The talent is there.  This could have been a fine film.

It isn't.

First of all there is no real chemistry between the two lovers.  There should have been more of a spark.  We all know what this spark looks like.  But these lovers just go through the motions and the relationship should not have felt so boring.  It's really a sad movie, dealing with pathos and illness and aging.  And worst of all is the classical music throughout which is slow and depressing.

This film couldn't end fast enough for me.  But it just dragged on and on.

So in spite of some good acting, I cannot recommend it.",1219708800,5,1387,4.493975903614458
8331964,2,B001P42Y9U,"Isabel Coixet should have known better especially after her ironic, knowing, intelligent ""Paris, Je Tame"" of last year but her latest ""Elegy"" is nothing that ""Paris"" is. In fact ""Elegy"" is a turgid, slow, many times silly remake of the Richard Gere/Winona Ryder weeper from 2000, ""Autumn in New York"" (starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder) in which an older man falls in love with a younger woman with dire consequences. And to make matters worse, Gere/Ryder do a much better job of making their characters real and thoughtful than do Ben Kingsley/Penelope Cruz in ""Elegy.""
Throughout ""Elegy"" I had the urge to bolt the theater because what was on the screen was so overwrought and self important (in fact something that can often be said of the source material writer, Philip Roth) that it set my teeth to grinding in consternation on viewing the melodramatics on the screen.
Ben Kingsley, often so good and beyond reproach in such films as ""Sexy Beast"" plays David Kapesh (a Roth alter-ego), a university professor and lover of all women under 25 but one who never makes a move on his prey until ""after the grades are posted."" In this case it is beautiful Cubana, Consuela (Cruz) who falls hard for Kapesh who, of course fails to commit. Kapesh will soil his hands with the sordid act of lovemaking but not with the tender act of loving.
Kingsley fails to ignite his characters inner core, though that inner core for all intents and purposes is filled with self interest and self hatred. Kingsley plays the surface of this role and as a consequence has little impact on us or on this film. Even more infuriatng about the David Kapesh character is his supposed moral superiority: he hautingly informs his estranged 30-ish son that he left his mother and cut off his children because ""it was the best thing to do for all concerned.""
Though Penelope Cruz fares better here, her role is a cipher: she's young, she's beautiful, she's a Latina so therefore her Consuela is written as a compliant sex plush toy: always willing, ever wanting, never attaining the  acceptance of even a 50 year old English Professor. This is a major miss-fire of this film and of director Coixet, a woman and someone who should have known better. Consuela has set back woman's rights back 50 years.
""Elegy"" is almost without redeeming qualities though the physical production is quite beautiful. But is this enough to recommend this film: a film that glorifies mendacity and the moral and social rights of the intelligent and well-bred (whatever that means in the year 2008) intelligentsia to run rampant over the up and coming? I think not.",1219449600,13,2619,4.79424778761062
