2693171,5,B000KKQBUI,"Time and again I've asked myself, why this movie, of all the superb mystery films of the 1950s, holds such potency.  My fascination with SO LONG AT THE FAIR (1950) began as a teenager when I saw the final portion of the film whilst channel-surfing on late night television.  It intrigued me so that I had to track down the video (yes, the video--remember them?) which became an oft-played favourite.  Now that I finally have the film again, this time in my DVD collection, I'm beyond thrilled to once again immerse myself in it's gas-lit charms.

""We were pretty""...  That's all Dirk Bogarde had to say in his official biography when trying to understand why SO LONG AT THE FAIR was such a success.  Yes, Bogarde and Jean Simmons are very attractive in the leads but it's a combination of them, a superbly written screenplay, evocative art direction and a certain undefinable ""sparkle"" that elevates the film above and beyond most of it's kind in the mystery genre.

SO LONG AT THE FAIR is a perfect example of the ""locked room"" mystery (others include ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""Dangerous Crossing""), where someone disappears beyond all comprehension in the most ordinary and safe of places--a closed room.  Vicky Barton (a most lovely Jean Simmons) and her older brother Johnny (David Tomlinson of ""Mary Poppins"" fame) have traveled to Paris to see the world-famous Paris Exhibition.  They book into the Hotel Unicorn (don't you just love the name?) and enjoy a night on the town before the big excitement of the fair itself.  On the morning of the Exhibition, Vicky awakes to discover that Johnny has disappeared...  Even his room is no longer ""there""!

No-one at the hotel recalls Vicky even having a brother in the first place.  Visits to the British Consul and even the local police prove fruitless.  Increasingly frantic, Vicky starts to believe that she's slowly being driven mad, until a chance encounter with George Hathaway (Dirk Bogarde), a bohemian artist who did briefly meet Johnny, turns the case on it's head...

Filled with twist after delicious twist, and a roster of fine British talent (including Honor Blackman and Cathleen Nesbitt as the hotel manager) SO LONG AT THE FAIR casts it's hypnotic spell for me every time.  Here's hoping that one day Criterion gives this movie the fanfare it deserves.",1292371200,8,2318,4.875
2693172,5,B000KKQBUI,"""...we were pretty,"" said Dirk Bogarde (John Coldstream: Dirk Bogarde: The Authorized Biography), in explaining why this Bogarde-Simmons concoction was popular at the time. Oh REALLY, Mr. Bogarde? And I suppose Laurence Olivier cast Jean Simmons as Ophelia in his 1947 ""Hamlet"" merely because she was pretty? No way!

And, although pretty they are, the two principal actors, as well as every single member of the cast do a top-notch job at all times. Not one slip, not one careless interpretation (for instance, George (Bogarde) flirts with Victoria (Simmons), but she doesn't flirt with him. She has something more important on her mind.) Cathleen Nesbitt as the hotel owner is especially good.

Above all, this is a mystery, and you will be scratching your head over the solution all through it. Set beautifully at the 1889 Paris Exhibition, it concerns---the disappearance of Miss Barton's brother (Johnny). Not only his disappearance, but that of his room at the elegant hotel, and from the memory of every single employee of the hotel. Fortunately, George borrowed 50 franks from Johnny the night before, and so, before Victoria, Johnny's sister,  goes completely out of her gourd, the sleuthing begins. The title comes from an old song (forgive me if you all know it; sometimes I think I'm older than I am):

Oh dear, what can the matter be?
Dear, dear, what can the matter be?
Oh, dear, what can the matter be--
Johnny's so long at the fair.
He promised to buy me a box of blue ribbons
to tie up my bonny brown hair.

I guessed the ending 6 minutes, 26 seconds before the end; by 3 minutes 11 seconds before the end, everyone knows. Some say, even, that the story is more or less true. That may be.",1249948800,5,1705,4.746621621621622

2693188,5,B000KKQBUI,"A film historian I know recommended SO LONG AT THE FAIR, but I wasn't able to find it for a while until now. This film is a superb example of an atmospheric mystery. Although the pacing is languid by today's standards, Jean Simmons and Dirk Bogarde deliver enigmatic performances, and coupled with a compelling plot, credible period details, and beautiful art direction, this film rises above the pedestrian and is rightly deserving of its cult status. Discovering it and viewing it for the first time today, I felt so lucky - as though I was being treated to something magical, and in a way, I was. SO LONG AT THE FAIR is a cinematic masterpiece indeed.

Jean Simmons plays a young woman, Vicky Barton, who along with her brother, Johnny (David Tomlinson) visit Paris to attend the Great Exhibition of 1889. The siblings put up at a hotel in separate rooms, and in the morning, Vicky discovers her brother missing. It is also rather strange that her brother's room appears to have disappeared as well! The hotel staff plead ignorance, claiming he never checked in, and this puts Vicky in a panic with the movie following her efforts to prove that her brother does indeed exist. Dirk Bogarde plays the part of the sympathetic ally.

Interestingly enough, after viewing this film, I was so impressed I decided to research the film. I discovered that the film had two directors, Antony Darnborough and Terence Fisher (the latter would eventually become well-known for directing some of Hammer Studio's cult classics such as HORROR OF DRACULA (1958), THE MUMMY (1959), and CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF (1961). I also discovered that Bogarde who had until this film, been primarily playing hoodlum type roles, was finally given a different role to prove his acting mettle. Simmons is amazing as always (and happens to be a personal favorite). There is so much going for this film and it really is a treat to watch. The stellar acting aside, I really enjoyed the period details. Thanks to my film historian friend who recommended this film and Amazon for making it available, I can now enjoy this classic and look forward to revisiting it in the near future.",1441497600,2,2146,4.797297297297297

2693194,3,B000KKQBUI,"So Long at the Fair, 1950 film

This is set in late 19th century Paris when an Exposition attracts visitors. A brother and sister get rooms for their visit. The couple visit Le Moulin Rouge to see the can-can dancers. Afterwards Johnny feels tires. The story continues. Next morning Johnny and Room 19 has disappeared! The hotel tells Miss Victoria Barton there never was a Room 19! What happened? The English Consol hears of the problem. He tells her to contact her parents. [If you look carefully you can see the painted backgrounds.] A balloon ride has an accident. Victoria goes to see the police about the disappearance of her brother, they investigate. Can she find a witness? Yes, and he investigates. Will the ledger hold a clue? Yes. They find the missing room! Another cover-up? A warning about a place where many people attend? It is a National Security secret.

8157810,5,B000KKQBUI,"A very young Dirk Bogarde and one of the eternal beauties of the cinema Jean Simmons star a film based on historical facts which happened on November 1889 in Paris.

Youll know what its about and you won't believe the impact of such decision.",1509408000,,242,4.5
8157811,5,B000KKQBUI,"I assumed, going into it, that 1950's So Long at the Fair would be this droll British comedy. I read the premise and got snookered, you see. I read, ""A British artist helps a young woman find her lost brother at the world's fair in 1889 Paris."" And I'd some weeks ago seen It Happened at the World's Fair, an Elvis Presley vehicle that played for laughs and presented a similar premise. But, no. So Long at the Fair isn't as lightweight as that. What it is, is a striking Grand Guignol and an unsettling and stylish, top drawer mystery that unravels in delightfully tangled fashion.

Oh, that poor English girl Victoria Barton (Jean Simmons). Giddy with excitement at having set foot in Paris, Vicky means to see the glorious sights and bask in the Lush Romance that is the City of Light. If only her older brother (and guardian) Johnny (David Tomlinson) would play along. But Johnny's been looking peaked. Note the pinched expressions, the recalcitrant mood. And yet Johnny dotes on his sister, and so he humors her some. They check into Hotel de Licorne (or Hotel Unicorn), grab a bite, take in the Moulin Rouge, and at last retire for the night, she repairing to Room 17, he to Room 19.

Comparisons to Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes are obvious and inescapable. Vicky awakens the morning after and knocks on Number 19, eager to go sight see, only to find that it's a lavatory and her brother nowhere in sight. Down at the lobby's front desk, the staff vigorously deny having seen Johnny. In fact, no one remembers him. A glance at the sign-in book reveals no record of his registration. Frantic visits at the British consul and the local constabulary yield no result but acres of skepticism. Alone in a foreign country, unable to speak the local tongue, no money to sustain her, and given the side eye by everyone, Vicky begins to crumble.

Part of what makes this such an interesting watch is the excellent acting all around. Jean Simmons, ever the gamine beauty, is winsome and fetching and all sorts of other complimentary adjectives. No, she isn't the heroine as much as she is the damsel-in-distress, but don't hold that against her. She's the catalyst that keeps the plot moving along. Simmons etches out a character part that exhibits commendable pluck and persistence while under extreme duress, even as doubt creeps in, even as she begins to question her sanity. All the while, she maintains a taut balance between gumption and increasing panic that keeps us rooting for her even as we question and second guess the things we'd seen in those early establishing scenes.

It's a gaslit conspiracy. It's a gothic romance. It adapts Anthony Thorne's 1947 novel. It draws from a famous urban legend concerning a mother and daughter who attend the Paris exposition. When the mother falls ill, the hotel physician dispatches the daughter to his home to fetch medicine. But when she returns, the doctor and the hotel staff claim she'd arrived alone earlier sans mama.

Things take a fortuitous turn for Vicky, courtesy of bohemian artist George Hathaway (Dirk Bogarde), the one person who believes her. It's when the sleuthing truly starts. It's tricky playing a character of such blas cool, but Bogarde, I think, pulls it off. George seems genuinely concerned with Vicky's plight. He goes to great and daring effort to help her out.

Credit the screenplay for generating an oppressive mood. It works hard to isolate Vicky. One clever touch is in having the French characters talk to each other in French (sans sub-titles). It's so that you can experience what Vicky, stranger in a strange land, is experiencing, the anxiety and dread and sense of isolation and disconnect that come with being the only one in the room to not understand what everyone else is saying.

The studio lavished much care in producing this movie, resulting in superior writing and casting and in authentic period detail. Yes, the third act unveils a (more or less) plausible, if unorthodox, denouement. And I loved that. It's such a refreshing swerve from the usual resolutions in detective stories. I won't spoiler what it is. I'll say that it partly has to do with that the world-famous Paris expo is expecting 20 million visitors. How's that for a tease?

So, our two leads are fantastic. But don't sleep on the supporting cast, most notably Cathleen Nesbitt as the chary hotel proprietress, Madame Herv. Honor Blackman has a bit part as George's lovely acquaintance, and the movie dabbles in minor tension, presenting her as a potential romantic foil to hinder our two leads' chemistry. Anyway, if you ever run into this movie, linger for a bit. Wallow in the suspense and eerieness of it, in Vicky's perplexing plight. It's a worthwhile experience for it's not a normal movie. It'll take you down strange paths. And the explanation, once you get to that bit, is one of the more original explanations. I do have one question, and I should attach a ***SPOILER ALERT*** here: Why couldn't they have just told Vicky what was up with her brother and then take her along with him? Once you break it down to her, I don't see Vicky raising much of a ruckus, which is what they were afraid of, hence the unnecessary intrigue.",1473552000,,5201,4.777530589543938
8157812,4,B000KKQBUI,"Yes, this film has the same plot as The Lady Vanishes, but please oh please don't make me even TRY to compare Jean Simmons with Margaret Lockwood. One is one of the most beautiful human beings to ever be captured on film, and the other is like a young Vivien Leigh with the sincere sweetness dialed to 11. Codemaster Talon saw this film and recommended it based on a single scene, and indeed that scene cemented this as a must-see film for me (but I'm getting ahead of myself). So you're already seen The Lady Vanishes? Why would you want to see this movie based on the same idea (protagonist is the only one who remembers a character who suddenly up and disappears and everyone is questioning said protagonist's sanity)?

Paris at The Fair

Okay, first of all, Paris is a cool setting for movies anyway, but The Fair is an even cooler setting (hot air balloons, and the brand new Eiffel Tower!). Then there's Jean Simmons' character who is absolutely GORGEOUS in this film with a breathtaking dress she wears for most of the film and a sweet sincere innocence that I found completely disarming. As Codemaster Talon said, the film is MOSTLY just her, and her outer and inner struggle. For a lessor actor this would be disastrous, but Jean Simmons' acting is so good that instead of boring you, you just get drawn in further and further into her incredibly believable struggle (she was nominated for awards for this role, and rightly so).

The Scene that Sells it

Without giving too much away, the turning point of the film coming when our protagonist FINALLY finds someone who SAW her brother and confirms that she ISN'T crazy. The scene could have been overblown, understated, or ruined in any number of ways, but instead it's an Academy Award worthy performance that is absolutely heart-breaking as you see this sweet, lovable, sincere young woman on the verge of a total nervous breakdown and desperately hanging onto any hope of saving her brother (and at the same time not believing that THIS time it won't prove a false hope). Seriously, this scene is AMAZING.

The sad points

This film is wonderfully acted, well-directed, engrossing, and overall..WONDERFUL! So..why not five stars?

I see enormous potential here that was not capitalized on. Quite frankly I think this film is ripe for a re-make. As I mentioned before, The Fair is an awesome setting, and it's not used enough. Imagine if say (Spoilers Again) the brother had disappeared AT The Fair.... That would have amped things up even more, because who HASN'T lost a family in a crowd some time in their life? In addition, the aspects of the film that incorporate The Fair and the time period are very cool atmosphere, so seeing more of that would have just made the film even more enjoyable.

Spoilers Galore!

It's on the cover of the DVD, the protagonist wears this sexy mask part of the film to hide that she hasn't left town. If she had been sneaking around for half the movie wearing that mask it would have been awesome. Instead it's like 10 minutes or something. When an element in a film works that well...you need more of it.

And while it was AWESOME that the entire ROOM where her brother was staying disappeared, the ultimate explanation for this MASSIVE cover-up is incredibly disappointing (and just plain doesn't make sense). I know, the whole ""spies kidnapped by family member"" plot is over-done to death, but that would have been vastly superior for the real reason for the brother's disappearance.

All in All

All in All I HIGHLY recommend this film if you enjoy the whole ""everyone thinks I'm crazy because someone disappeared and only I remember that they exist"" plot-line. Is it a better movie than The Lady Vanishes? Probably not. Is it a more enjoyable film? In my opinion, definitely (Jean Simmons' acting, expressiveness, emotion, and yes, beauty ALONE make this a more enjoyable film). Just don't ask me to compare Jean Simmons to Margaret Lockwood.",1472947200,,3943,4.748538011695906
