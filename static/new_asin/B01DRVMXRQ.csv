8756715,1,B01DRVMXRQ,This is terribly sad.  I can not believe we treat animals this way.  I am totally disgusted.  How is it no one gets that we are such complete idiots?  In one scene the guy refers to the giraffes as being dumb as a bag of rocks and sticks bananas on their heads.  Then other times you see these beautiful creatures stuck in cages.  I am baffled that no one sees how disgusting this is.  Wow.,1513382400,,390,4.12
8756716,5,B01DRVMXRQ,What a quirky and beautiful story about zookeepers! I never really thought about the people behind the scene at zoos...never really liked the ideas of zoos and when I saw this documentary it gave me a deep insight into these amazing caretakers. Praises to this wonderful production!,1487376000,,282,5.0212765957446805

8756720,5,B01DRVMXRQ,"For any animal lover, See the Keepers is a must watch.  The ""Keepers"" paint a picture of the joys, sorrows and responsibilities of living with and loving wild animals.  The dedication of the zoo keepers is shown, not only by the amount of manure that is shoveled daily, but also by the love and respect every Keeper has for their animals.  This is a film about the choices that all zoos make regarding the care and propagation versus the freedom of the animals that should be in the wild.  And the choices are never easy.",1474243200,,521,4.4526315789473685
8756721,5,B01DRVMXRQ,"As a keeper myself I absolutely loved this documentary. After seeing the trailer for this 3 years ago I have been waiting and watching The Keepers facebook page for release dates and this was well worth the wait. See the Keepers does a great job of giving a glance into our lives and passion; as well as, portraying keepers as the real people they are and the great work that they do. I loved it.",1474070400,,396,4.293333333333333
8756722,5,B01DRVMXRQ,"I was fortunate to see this movie during a screening and it did not disappoint!  I've always enjoyed the Memphis zoo; however, the Keepers takes us to a new level by following the animal caretakers and giving us a glimpse into their daily lives.  You get a glimpse of the daily grind of animal care taking and, more importantly you learn about the individual keepers and their hopes and dreams.  The quirky and beloved cast of characters come alive in this documentary and make you root for the animals....and the people who love them.  SEE THE KEEPERS!",1473984000,,553,4.670103092783505
8756723,5,B01DRVMXRQ,"This film truly shows what it takes to do what these people do. I am a reptile keeper myself, and I found myself repeatedly agreeing with everything these amazing keepers felt and said. It's not an easy job but it's incredibly rewarding in the end. Fantastic documentary and a great inside look into the world of the keeper.",1473984000,,324,4.603448275862069
