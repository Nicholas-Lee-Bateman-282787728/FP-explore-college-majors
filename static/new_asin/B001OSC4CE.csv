8331385,1,B001OSC4CE,"Really lousy flick from D'Amato. All actors-men and women are ugly, plot very primitive and imagination is size of below zero.",1471910400,,126,5.0476190476190474
8331386,5,B001OSC4CE,I like simple story and erotic merits of Carla Solaro. As a fan I would like to see much of her movies but they are so few.,1395792000,,123,3.5925925925925926
8331387,2,B001OSC4CE,"Another over-hyped release from MYA Studios - the story about a girl who wins a contest and goes to the big city in hopes of becoming a tv star, only to find out otherwise. Truly inspiring plotline,ay? Well, it only gets worse from there. The lead actress is not as attractive as the cover would have you believe, the story about the 'behind the scenes' in TV makes a daytime soap opera seem complex and, frankly, there`s just not enough nudity to make you forget how bad this is, even in the pantheon of bad Joe D`Amato films. Why it`s generally listed in the Horror / Exploitation catagory is beyond me - I think they think folks who like these genre`s will (and often do) buy anything. After all, they got my money, didn`t they? Take my advice, and wait for 'Island of the Fishmen' to come out, it`s gonna be bad but, hopefully, in a good way.",1250812800,4,846,4.360759493670886
