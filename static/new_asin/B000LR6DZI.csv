8163792,4,B000LR6DZI,"This is a worthwhile aviation video, and useful for anyone who has bought the PMDG MD-11 Flight Simulator software.

If nothing else it certainly brings home some of the limitations of the aircraft together with some insight into the flight planning.",1232409600,4,250,5.097560975609756
8163793,4,B000LR6DZI,"I am Swiss and when I was young we always flew form Santiago de Chile to Zurich with Swissair in this beautiful MD-11, and that was around the time Swissair just bought its first MD-11's. This is the principal reason I bought it, it remembers my childhood. Lamentably Swiss made its last flight with this plane in 2004; this video of course is before that time but anyway, if you are an airplane fan and want to see the MD-11 cockpit in detail, I mean, with an explanation of all the instruments, then this is the video for you!! I don't give maximum punctuation because video is too long and after the third flight you already know how the plane starts and lands, plus I would have liked to see the luggage room. What I will have to do now is red about air traffic and I am sure I'll understand much better the routs they are programming, I believed that flying form A to B was the same as when you go with your car to another city, but believe me!! Its impressive how may routs a plane can configure in its autopilot. Enjoy the video!!",1202515200,3,1037,4.269035532994923
