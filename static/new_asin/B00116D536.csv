8240727,2,B00116D536,"I've been a Wong Faye fan for over a decade, own over a dozen of her CDs, and have watched ""Chungking Express"" enough to be able to recite much of the dialogue in Cantonese.  I had high expectations for this DVD, and I take no pleasure in giving it at best a 2-star rating.

Visually the DVD is of poor quality, at least compared to some of the other concert DVDs that I've watched recently.  It has a grainy look to it, and often the camera angles catch a prominently glowing statium EXIT sign in the background.  Her choice of costumes appear thrown together at the last minute -- she's literally wearing an upside-down high heel shoe on her head with a long feather taped to it for the inital set, which is made worse when the shoe starts coming off her head and she becomes distracted trying to keep it on.

But the visuals withstanding, her vocals seem uninspired and unenergetic.  It's as if she is only going through the motions, and the crowd seems to pick up on this, wildly excited at first, then barely willing to clap along with a couple of songs even when the band leader is all but begging them to do so.

I've never seen Wong Faye in concert so I don't know if this DVD is representative of her style.  I do know that some musicians do far better in studio than in concert, and vice versa, and it may be that Wong Faye's talents are better brought forth in the privacy of a recording studio than on a large stage.

This is an expensive DVD to purchase -- even the 2-disc blu-ray of Clapton's Crossroads 2010 is $6 less than this.  If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy Wong Faye's DVD and instead would spend the money on a couple of her new CDs.

Again, I'm a huge fan of Wong Faye, but it's a stretch for me even to give this a weak 2-star rating. Zhen bu hao... :(",1299715200,,1783,4.184210526315789
