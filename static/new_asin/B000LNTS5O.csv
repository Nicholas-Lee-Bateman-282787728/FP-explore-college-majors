8546094,2,B000LNTS5O,"Although this may be a lovely video about fall in Vermont, I was extremely disappointed that it is only about 23 minutes long. It is advertised both on the outside of the cover and on the DVD itself with a running time of 1hr,10 minutes. Sorry, I cannot recommend this DVD due to fact it is not worth the price.",1184889600,9,311,4.2
