8526982,5,B008DG312C,"""The fight for sustainability has begun,"" is the powerful statement posed to the viewer at the conclusion of the ""Sourlands"" trailer. Director and award-winning journalist Jared Flesher uncovers the story of the struggles of the people dealing with the threatened ecosystem in the Sourlands of Central New Jersey. The film focuses on four respective perils of the area: farm, forest, sustainable technology, and future. The intermingling of personal interviews and stunning photography constructs a dynamic and stimulating documentary.

The viewer is introduced to a wide range of residents of the Sourlands, including farmers, engineers, and of course, the wildlife. The detrimental effects of global warming, such as abnormal weather patterns which cause flooding or drought, are taking a toll on the farmers, who are already plagued with sky-high property taxes and land prices. Meanwhile, local engineers relentlessly experiment with new ways to conserve energy in an attempt to allay global warming.

As the film progresses, it becomes obvious that these issues are by no means unique to the Sourlands. Yet by narrowing in on a specific area, Flesher presents a major global issue on a personal level. ""Sourlands"" effectively encourages people to take action to aid our overworked planet without crossing the line to uncomfortably didactic. The residents evoke the humaneness in the viewers, making viewers more inclined to take the small steps to help restore the nature surrounding us.",1374710400,,1492,5.482608695652174
8526983,5,B008DG312C,"I'm from NJ, so this documentary was especially moving to me. The stories of these farmers, environmentalists, and more and their relation to the NJ Sourlands was something I had not heard about. The land is so beautiful and I think it is so great that someone is documenting the challenges this ecosystem is facing. Even more inspiring was the people working to protect the Sourlands. Absolutely loved this film. There's a lot to learn from it.",1369353600,,445,4.792207792207792
8526984,5,B008DG312C,"Sourlands is a very well constucted documentary examining life in a small patch of area in Central NJ.  The movie addresses how people and animals use and/or abuse the land in this area which is one of the few remaining green spots between Philadelphia and NY.  I live in this general area, but the film introduced me to many new perspectives of my neighbors.  I found the film educational as well as enjoyable.  I thought it was well paced and shared some interesting viewpoints without being ""preachy"".  I hope this film is widely viewed.  I look forward to director Jared Flesher's next work.",1343001600,2,595,4.728155339805825
8526985,5,B008DG312C,"This film brings the Sourlands to life through a series of irresistible character studies, modeled after John McPhee's approach to The Pine Barrens.

Four lively segments focus on Farm, Forest, Sustainable Technology, and the Future.

Photography is stunning, and these Sourlands people unique and memorable.

For all the ecological perils which lace the Sourlands, --pivotal bird habitat and water source--, this is a film of hope.

One learns a multiplicity of steps available to one person, one family, one neighborhood, in the restoration of nature in our time and in our region.

8526986,5,B008DG312C,"A well-made, in-depth documentary about the various sustainability efforts taking place on many different levels -- from farming, to cultivating native species, to engineering and technology projects -- in Central New Jersey.  Just finished watching my copy of it as one of the kickstarter supporters. It's an excellent film that I'm recommending to my friends!",1341100800,,361,5.5636363636363635
8526987,5,B008DG312C,"I attended the premiere of this documentary in Hopewell, NJ, and the sold-out house adored it.  It tackles some very serious global issues from the perspective of individuals who are working for change in their small part of the world.  While the issues are serious, the tone of the film is optimistic and entertaining.  I can't wait to watch it again.",1341014400,,352,4.737704918032787
8526988,5,B008DG312C,"This is a wonderfully moving documentary that I cannot praise enough! Shared stories from farmers, hunters, environmentalists, naturalists, business entrepreneurs, and the interconnected  community thriving in and near the Sourlands of New Jersey. I spent four years in this area personally and loved to watch a movie give glimpses into the lives of people working so hard to protect both the land and its inhabitants, be it man, plant, or animal.
It was a realistic take on the sometimes overwhelming problem we face with today's environment, but gave hope and solid examples of how people are trying their best to help a place they love.",1341014400,4,639,5.085714285714285
