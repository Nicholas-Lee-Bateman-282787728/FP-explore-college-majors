8533691,3,B009146OSS,"As another review has also stated, this volume is mislabeled. More specificly: Disc 2, which is suposed to include the episodes, ""High Beams In the Rear View Mirror"", ""Up, Up and Away!"" etc. When in turn it is actually Disc 2 from *Volume 3* which includes the episodes ""Society Stomach Pump"", ""Open Casket Wedding"" etc. I know this because I bought the other 3 volumes. So, I now have two discs with the exact same episodes and am missing out on 2 episodes; 10 segments altogether. My advice to anyone interested in purchasing this 2nd volume would be to either skip it and save yourself the money, or purchase it for the pure sake of the episodes on Disc 1. I just caution you to remember what it is you'll get from the Disc 2 included in this volume.",1393891200,,753,4.424460431654676
8533692,4,B009146OSS,I had the same problem with Disc 2 being mislabeled  I sent it back and received the new copy that was also mislabeled and called Amazon to report this.  My mom told me to just watch it and double check.  She was right and I went online to cancel my 3 request for a new copy.  I wish I checked the comments when I ordered it in the first place or played the disc any way.  Hindsight is 20/20.  A lot of heartache but completely happy with the end result!!!!,1392940800,,457,4.022222222222222
8533693,5,B009146OSS,"This is the series hosted by Natasha Henstridge that was on TLC and Discovery. The DVDs are somewhat mislabeled on the second discs (Volume 1's second is read as Vol. 2 Disc 2, Vol. 2 read as Vol. 3, etc.), but I keep them in their cases anyway, so it's a moot point. The DVDs work perfectly. The first disc did pause/freeze for a second in the middle of the second episode, but it was only on my DVD player; when I used another, there was no pause at all. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to find the show.",1392854400,,518,4.088235294117647
