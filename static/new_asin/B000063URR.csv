This movie is SO ridiculously silly. Ever wonder what you would do with 'it' if you could wright your name in the snow? The two leading characters find out what THEY can do with one... When the ""Penous fairy"" hears there drunken pleas one night.
This movie is so bad as to rank alongside such ""dogs"" as Killer Tomatoes and RHPS.",1447718400,,430,4.5256410256410255
