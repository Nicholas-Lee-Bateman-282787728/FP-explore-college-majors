8288173,3,B001CLG6W2,"You have likely seen all of this before:  two ""Mannix"" episodes, two ""Peter Gunn"" episodes, and a ""Wagon Train"" and a ""Burke's Law"" apiece.  The ""Mannix"" episodes are the only ones in color, and suffer for it a bit, in that the color is not true or consistent.  These and the accompanying black-and-white episodes vary as to the condition of the source material used for the release, but all are about as good as these same programs packaged by others--and, as suggested above, there are a number.

""Mannix"" is represented by two first-season episodes:  'The Name is Mannix' and 'Skid Marks on a Dry Run'.  The first of these, also the series' pilot episode, has Mannix investigating the reported kidnaping of a mobster's daughter.  The opening sequence is missing from this episode--no establishing scene, no theme music--but not an issue, as that first scene does not affect the plot.  Also, the sound is mastered at too high a level which muddies it a bit; you may have to turn it down.  The second ""Mannix"" episode fares better.  There is still the color issue, but the sound is tamed and the episode is complete.  The story this time involves a man with political aspirations who hires Mannix to scrutinize his life for the hint of scandal that could derail a candidacy.  Of possible interest is the fact that the opening theme is isolated, entering after a dramatic pause that follows some terse dialog.  There is brief silence, then the music, so the theme begins ""clean"".  Normally the introductory scene collides noisily with Lalo Shifrin's lovely theme--dramatic, but possibly annoying for music lovers.  A couple of the bumpers have been left in--having been used to mark station breaks and identify sponsors--and the Desilu logo is included after the closing credits, a treat for ""golden age"" buffs and TV historians.

""Peter Gunn"" is represented by 'Let's Kill Timothy' and 'The Fuse', both found on numerous public domain DVDs.  In the first one, one of the lighter episodes, Timothy is a seal (yes, a seal) that bad guys are trying to nab, while Gunn's job is to see that they don't.  'The Fuse' has Gunn reluctantly working for a gangster who claims to have been framed for the murder of a rival.  Bumpers for the commercial breaks appear a time or two--a stylish title graphic accompanied by a broken guitar chord, the effect here marred a bit by rather fuzzy sound.  The two episodes are good, with adequate picture and sound, but you have likely seen them many times.

""Wagon Train"" gives us 'Alias Bill Hawks', very available on budget DVDs.  In it, a letter Bill Hawks receives from a friend asking for help takes him to a dying settlement in the desert, where he finds the friend has vanished, and a shady fellow now claims ownership of his land and the rights to water discovered there.  A good episode, with clear picture and sound--there are surprisingly few condition issues with this film, but it looks good on other collections too.  Two station break bumpers appear at the mid-point of the episode, but the Revue Productions logo, normally seen after the closing credits, has been cut.  Go figure.

The ""Burke's Law"" episode is 'Who Killed Jason Shaw?'.  This one appears everywhere on inexpensive DVDs, and is apparently the only episode of this show in the public domain.  Quality is terrible, with so many splices and jumps in the film for the first five minutes or so that one will want to just give up (I did).  This terrific series has been released on authorized, good-quality DVD sets.  I recommend you go there, not here.

So, what do we have?  Well, some good entertainment for not-too-picky viewers who have not already seen all of this stuff umpteen times.  This DVD sells cheap, normally a few bucks, and there is enough watchable stuff here to make it a bargain.  In addition, things like the isolated ""Mannix"" theme and the bumpers  which accompanied commercial breaks, rarely seen or heard since these shows first aired, can be of interest to collectors.  If you want impeccable quality, though, this is not for you.",1320796800,,4061,4.801152737752162
