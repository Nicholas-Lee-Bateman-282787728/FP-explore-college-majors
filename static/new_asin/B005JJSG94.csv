4712883,4,B005JJSG94,"David Byrne presents a series of retrospective snapshots of early Talking Heads, live performances recorded back when they were recent art school grads and most folks weren't yet hip to what they were doing. Alas, I was one of those clueless souls. When I first saw them play at an outdoor gig on the UCLA campus in 1979, I was intrigued by the subversive paranoia of ""Psycho Killer"" and by their transformation of Al Green's ""Take Me to the River,"" but I have to admit I was not bowled over by most of their songs or by their frontman. Who the hell was this jittery new wave robot?

Fortunately that reaction was due to my own shortcomings and prejudices as a listener rather than any deficiencies in the group or their music, and fortunately producer Brian Eno recognized their unique sound and vision and decided to collaborate with them. The insistent rhythms and angular melodies and oblique lyrics finally worked their way into my brain and took root, and I became a fan, buying and listening to everything they released.

At last we have a video compilation to document the development of one of the most vital avant-garde groups in rock history. The performances are well-filmed, if at times rather fuzzy or grainy, but they are amply worth the viewing and listening. Byrne points out that ""the early clips were obviously not commercial--the sound and image can be a little rough--but you can see the extremely stripped down version of the band playing at CBGB in those days.""

During the course of the 67-minute program, we watch as players are gradually added to the mix, enriching the sound and making it more and more compelling. Especially important to its evolution was the 1980 addition of two Funkadelic members, keyboardist Bernie Worrell and percussionist Steve Scales, as well as guitarist Adrian Belew, who would soon join King Crimson. As Byrne writes about the ""Chronology"" project, which took him several years to assemble, ""What you really get is a sense of how tight this band was.""

I recommend the deluxe edition over the plain DVD. Contained within a colorful 48-page hardcover book are numerous photos, handwritten lyrics, and an angst-ridden Lester Bangs review from 1979 (Byrne calls it ""a beautiful existential rant""). There are 15 songs on the program from the mid-70s to the early 80s, including gigs on Old Grey Whistle Test, Saturday Night Live, American Bandstand, Late Night with David Letterman, the US Festival, and the Montreux Festival. At the end is a performance of ""Life During Wartime"" from Talking Heads' 2002 reunion at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. And there are excellent extras on the DVD: a 10-minute interview with David in 1978, a 35-minute profile from the British ""South Bank Show"" in 1979, and enlightening full-length commentary newly recorded by all four bandmates.

When I attended the ""Stop Making Sense"" tour stop in Seattle in 1983, I was as electrified as everyone else by how the group had blossomed creatively; the injection of funk into the musical mix was a stroke of brilliance. You can hear and see this during the only song they play from the album ""Speaking in Tongues"": their massive hit ""Burning Down the House."" But ""Chronology"" isn't about commercial success. It's about the birth of genius. The photos and essay in the book and the words and music on the DVD capture it very well. Fans of Talking Heads owe it to themselves to check out the band's beginnings.

Also recommended is a live double LP from 1982, ""The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads,"" with tracks from concerts between 1977 and 1981. The first disc features the quartet on their own while the second features the group with six sidemen. Rereleased as a 2-CD edition in 2004, the 17 original cuts are augmented by 16 additional numbers. If you enjoy ""Chronology,"" ""The Name of This Band"" is a must-have.

4712884,5,B005JJSG94,"No doubt in my mind this has got to be f****** awesome!
How could it not?
The Talking Heads is one of the most influential, critically amazing bands to ever exist.
I only wish I could see them in person, one last time.
Well, it would also be my first time.
Please David, I appeal to you, please get back together with your band-mates for one last hurrah!
Fulfill the dreams of countless Head Heads.
(once again, please!)

Thank you,

Being of Light",1322006400,8,448,4.385542168674699
4712885,5,B005JJSG94,"So glad someone thought to film the band, and then someone put this together.
This is not just one for the fans, lots of good music.",1359936000,,132,4.115384615384615
4712886,5,B005JJSG94,"This DVD shows the start of the Talking Heads in their simplest raw form.  David Byrne playing lead guitar and singing in a way only he can do.  You get a real sense of how they started in the small clubs and exploded into the music scene.  I still think the first two albums, Talking Heads: 77 and More Songs About Buildings and Food are the core of the greatness of the Talking Heads and this DVD shows some of the earliest renditions of these songs in small live settings.",1359244800,3,475,4.2555555555555555
4712887,5,B005JJSG94,"As a long time Talking Heads fan, I thought this collection did a great job of showing the growth of the band as performers in the late 70s and early 80s. You can see David Byrne turn his awkwardness into his own quirky kind of performance piece. You can see Tina Weymouth grow from musical skills that were merely adequate to becoming a real artist on the bass and keyboard. And, the additional interviews give some great insights into the band's philosophy. Finally, just seeing Talking Heads interviewed by Dick Clark and performing on American Bandstand was worth the purchase price.",1356048000,3,587,4.821782178217822
4712888,5,B005JJSG94,"I found this DVD to be truly fascinating. Not so much for the music, which is thoroughly enjoyable to a Talking Heads fan, but observing the personal growth and disparate personalities of the band as it was starting to take off.  David Byrne is painfully shy and awkward when being interviewed, yet drops all his barriers when behind the microphone fronting the band.  Tina Weymouth comes to the rescue and seems the most at ease and changes the least over time. It is interesting to see how early the secondary band members were integrated into live events (and who also appeared in Stop Making Sense and continued on with the Tom Tom Club). My 16 month old couldn't stop dancing and boppin' to the music. The technology is antique by today's standards, but cleaned up pretty well. If you are a Talking Heads fan, it worth picking up. I also recommend picking up the double-CD, ""The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads"". You will NOT stop moving while listening to it.",1354147200,,968,4.622093023255814
4712889,5,B005JJSG94,This DVD is so much fun. watch it intently or just as backround. It's wonderful to watch the growth and change of the band and DB as this moves from the mid 70's to the 2000's . brilliant and fun!,1353456000,,196,3.925
4712890,5,B005JJSG94,"So much music on here, from so many sources.  Looking back on this I still can not believe that the Talking Heads sold a single record!  I actually saw them play live on Saturday Night Live in the late 70's, I just could not believe what the hell they were doing!  I kind of followed them after that, hearing a few songs like Life During Wartime from Fear of Music.  Then Burning Down the House became a monster hit, and they followed it up with the live video Stop Making Sense.  When I first saw the video, I just could NOT believe that it was real!  It was just the craziest thing I had ever seen.  Now this package comes out, and to get to watch video from so many sources is just really, really, special.  I wish I could have the ENTIRE sets from any of this sources!  It is going to take me awhile to internalize all this, the performances just show over and over that this band, The Talking Heads, is one of the GREATEST bands of ALL TIME.  check them out.  Cheers.",1343779200,,972,4.172043010752688
4712891,1,B005JJSG94,"Specting a discography. a confuse documentary instead. old images, scattered songs. the informations are not in good sequence. maybe for very well informed fans.",1337472000,2,161,5.75
4712892,5,B005JJSG94,"Fantastic compilation. Great songs selection, complete booklet information plus Lester Bangs' essay. If you love rock this a must!!.
This band really deserves a DVD like this one.",1337385600,,179,5.428571428571429
4712893,4,B005JJSG94,This is very cool.  Lots of concert footage and history.  Provides insight into the time period and band for anyone who wants to research it or nostalgia for anyone who lived it.  I kind of wish I had spent the extra cash and ordered the deluxe edition.,1333670400,2,253,4.340425531914893
4712894,5,B005JJSG94,"this video is a must have for db fans and the Talking Heads. It starts out with old video with sort of not so great pix and sound but outstanding to see the early video, and within a couple songs graduates to normal db high quality entertainment. Excellent fun!",1331424000,2,261,4.346938775510204
4712895,4,B005JJSG94,"Great insight into a truly important band.
The music is interrupted occasionally by commentary.
(FYI to video editors: THAT ALWAYS SUCKS!)
We enjoyed it for the ""backstage/studio"" journey.
The audio was fairly good, considering the technology of the time.",1328572800,3,255,5.564102564102564
4712896,5,B005JJSG94,"What's nice about this collection is how well it complements the rest of Talking Heads' limited catalog of live releases.  While the package design and between-segment disc presentation fits right in with the gimmicky and careless visual appearance of about half of their albums, the content--a mix of live performances (or ""live"" in at least the American Bandstand bit) broadcast on TV and concert bits recorded professionally and sometimes perhaps not--does a nice job of adding to what's already been released without duplicating anything.  None of these performances were included among the live videos in the CD-DVD reissues from several years ago, though some of these are from the same concerts.  So no double-dipping here, even if it would be nice to have those 8 spots included on the disc if for no other reason than more convenient viewing.  Furthermore, where Stop Making Sense focuses on their late-middle period songs, this set is all about the pre-1983 songs.  In fact, for the first time we really get to see and hear the Heads' original three-piece sound over the first several performances here from 1976.  Finally, it's great to see their too-short 2002 reunion captured here.  Overall, this is the perfect video companion to The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads.

This video is much shorter than I'd like it to be.  There is clearly more extant concert footage from each of the gigs represented here, though I suppose much further inclusion would have duplicated some songs.  Then of course there's the fact that they basically stopped performing together after filming Stop Making Sense despite recording a few more albums.  I guess you can say Byrne quit when he knew he was a Head.  But a bad joke doesn't make that final performance any less bittersweet as one wonders what they could  have recorded in the intervening years, or better yet performed.  It makes it seem as if Frantz, Weymouth and Harrison were just talented musicians Byrne played with for a number of years, and now he just goes out and plays some of those songs with other sidemen.  This video showcases the great music they made together, and the understated yet agitated appearance that made that music so intriguing.  So five stars for the video content, but if I could I would take two stars away from Mr. Byrne.",1327104000,11,2310,4.884615384615385
4712897,4,B005JJSG94,"The Talking Heads Chronology Deluxe DVD really is pretty cool. The footage is really interesting, especially the bonus features. It was a worthwhile watch.

HOWEVER, there was one thing that really bothered me: THE EDITING. Maybe I'm just a picky art student, but it is completely obvious the editing between clips was done pretty hastily, and probably on iMovie. (Not that there's anything wrong with iMovie, but you have to disguise your use of it if you're going to do it well.) The fade-outs between clips were much too quick (I recognized them as the default fade-out speed for iMovie) and many times cut off the ends of people's speech. The choices in where to cut clips were also really clunky and not very natural- you'd think cutting a clip after someone talks would be alright, but there's one in particular (I think it's the intro montage) that cuts right as David starts talking again and it's really distracting. The commentary was also a little strange, in that it didn't explain beforehand that they weren't commenting together- each member is separate (to be honest, I was looking forward to whatever drama would ensue with David thrown in with the rest of them.) It's interesting commentary though- the best part is when, during the Hall of Fame performance, David says something like ""Now you get to see your favorite band all old and pasty, just like you. Maybe it's better not to see that."" (Ha ha ha)

Besides that blunder, the book-style casing is beautiful and the footage is great if you love the Heads as much as I do.",1327017600,5,1543,4.732342007434944
4712898,5,B005JJSG94,"First, I definitely recommend the ""Deluxe Limited Edition"", this review is based on that Edition. This dvd contains some very significant, early rare, previously unreleased, footage of the Talking Heads. The Talking Heads along with the Ramones, Blondie, & Patti Smith were among the very finest punk rock bands to emerge from the New York City ""CBGB"" music scene, and all are inductees into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. I was fortunate to visit CBGB's in NYC before it was shut-down in 2006, due to a dispute between Hilly Krystal (founder) & the owner of the building.

The Deluxe Limited Edition Contains a DVD, a Hard Back Book written by the late Lester Bangs for the Village Voice, only in this Edition, you get his written works about the Talking Heads in a previously unreleased ""Unedited"" form. The Bonus Material on the DVD contains: The South Bank Show 1979, which actually is video/ audio commentaries by David Byrne, Chris Franz, Jerry Harrison, & Tina Weymouth, with their performances playing in the background.

I know the amazon product description lists the songs on the dvd, but it doesn't list the venue, & other info about the song, so I'll include that info in my review.

1. Mic Test (The Kitchen NYC 1976)
2. With Our Love (CBGB 1975 NYC)
3. I'm Not in Love (CBGB 1975 NYC)
4. Psycho Killer (intro by Seymour Stein, Sire Records, CBGB 1975 NYC)
5. Intros Montage (the Kitchen NYC 1976)
6. The Girls Want to be with the Girls (the Kitchen NYC 1976)
7. Don't Worry About the Government (Old Grey Whistle Test Show, UK 1978)
8. Dressing Room fan footage & ""Found a Job"" (Entermedia Theatre NYC 1978)
9. Thank you for sending Me an Angel (Entermedia theatre NYC 1978)
10. Warning Sign (Sproul Plaza, Berkely, CA 1978)
11. Artist Only (Saturday Night Live 1979 NYC)
12. Take Me to the River (American Bandstand 1979) NOTE: On this one, after the Talking Heads finish the song, Dick Clark begans to interview David Byrne, and David ""freezes up"", so Dick went over to Tina and asked her was David always that shy? Tina replies that David is ""Organically Shy"". Also it should be noted that this performance sounds just like the radio version, because Dick Clark had the bank ""lip-synching"" their instruments. This is covered in detail in the book ""This must be the Place"" by David Bowman on pages 145-146.

Note: The Following songs are greatly improved, along with David Byrne's confidence, also you get the addition of several talented, African-American, backup musicians to the band.

13. Crosseyed and Painless (Capitol Theatre, NJ 1980, includes Brian Eno)
14. Animals (rockpop concert, Germany 1980 includes Brian Eno)
15. Love - Building on Fire (US Festival San Bernardino, CA 1982)
16. Cities (Montreux Festival, Montreux, Switzerland 1982 - NOTE: This is simply an ""Awesome Performance"". ""....Did I forget to mention Memphis, the home of Elvis & the ancient Greeks....?""
17. Burning Down the House (Dave Letterman Show NYC 1983)
18. Life During Wartime (Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony NYC 2002).

In conclusion, if you like the Talking Heads, I highly recommend this Deluxe Limited Edition of their ""Chronology"", you'll love it. Thanks and I hope this review has been helpful.

P.S. Just an extra note, Jerry Harrison has been producing records for blues guitarist, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, from my home state of Louisiana. Jerry appears on Kenny Wayne's ""10 Days Out-Blues From the Backroads"" DVD/CD, as the producer. He's acually in the DVD. Also, Jerry has been involved in producing Kenny Wayne Shepherd's ""Live in Chicago"" CD, and ""How I Go"" studio CD.",1326067200,18,3594,4.862745098039215

To have decades of musical growth gathered into a single collection is an endless delight. Yet, for me--even more than these snapshots of the band as an increasingly sophisticated whole--the most remarkable thing in this retrospective is watching a man save his own life through the act of performing...David Byrne, from his almost painful awkwardness in the mid-70s, to the expressions of sheer musical joy of the 80s, to the comfort and assurance of the mature artist.
