2761183,5,B000N8UY1E,"After reading the previous reviews for this DVD, the only thing I can add is that seeing the little mistakes that always happen in a live production makes these skits even funnier.  The camaraderie among the entire cast can be seen in their studio versions but it is even more pronounced in the live version.  It wraps up the series and closes out a wonderful period in British humor.  It is best to see this one after watching the previous First, Second, and Third Series.",1184457600,,473,4.541176470588235
2761184,5,B000N8UY1E,If you Love Little Britain - or British humor - you won't be disappointed.  Full of creativity - and simply hilarious. It is brilliant to see skits performed live and the twists that Matt Lucas and David Walliams have come up with.,1182816000,,231,4.5
2761185,4,B000N8UY1E,"Little Britain is one of the oddest shows to come over the Atlantic.  Their humor is very strange, somewhat disgusting, and they both like to dress as women.  But somehow they pull it off and have created a uniquely entertaining series.  The live show that this is is not as ""elegant"" as their TV series due, most likely, to having to please an audience.  Still, it is a good addition to the previous 3 series if you've been jonesing for a hit.",1182816000,,444,4.378048780487805
2761186,4,B000N8UY1E,"I first heard about these guys in Entertainment Weekly a few years ago so I decided to check season 1 DVD out. I loved them and they seemed to get funnier with each season. A must for any British comedy lovers.
This show has many of the same character they do in their regular show but it's Live.
Great stuff.",1181779200,4,309,4.166666666666667
2761187,5,B000N8UY1E,"Matt and David are brilliant.  The live show just proves it.  I loved seeing the adlibs and bloopers and especially the segment on David swimming the Channel.

On a side, Paul Putner was fabulous in all of the little roles he played.  His costume changes were infinitely more complex and faster than some of the others.

For British comedy lovers, this is a must own!!!",1181347200,,369,4.615384615384615
2761188,5,B000N8UY1E,"This is the live version of Little Britain that played on stages around the UK, which means that the performances were uncensored, but not over the top. All of the favorite skits are represented including a cameo from Anthony Head as the Prime Minister. What is more interesting I found was the parallel story of costar David Walliams' training during the stage tour for an attempt to swim the English Channel for charity and his subsequent successful attempt. The DVD is well done with a blend of on-stage performances, off-stage background, and David's training.",1180483200,7,564,5.01063829787234

8175602,4,B000N8UY1E,I own the entire series of Little Britain.  I think Matt Lucas and David Walliams are brilliant!!  The only things I don't like are the vomit humor and the pee humor.,1449100800,,166,4.32258064516129
8175603,5,B000N8UY1E,David Walliams and Matt Lucas are my shizzzz!,1423785600,,45,4.75
8175604,5,B000N8UY1E,Such a funny show. My husband and I love it.,1420243200,,44,3.5
8175605,5,B000N8UY1E,OMG a must buy! This is the last of some of their recent live events and hilarious but best enjoyed by those who have seen all of the stuff they have already done ....as some of the skits are shortened and if you know the original skit it makes more sense. I love these guys and all their characters. That naughty Prime Minister really should hook up with Sebastian! The end is a real riot!!!,1413244800,,392,4.24
8175606,5,B000N8UY1E,Theses guys rock not just because they are funny but there are independently funny because of the way you view stupid and laugh at it.,1377216000,,134,4.4
8175607,5,B000N8UY1E,"Unbelivable fun. Two actors made the great funny movie. You can watch it 24/7 and you have the good time. we have full collection, all seasons. And our friends bought
the same, when they watched it in our house :).",1293408000,,214,4.375
8175608,5,B000N8UY1E,I love these two!! When I see them I know whatever it is it's gonna' be hilarious! Especially Live! They are brilliant!,1241654400,,119,4.454545454545454
8175609,5,B000N8UY1E,"Possibly one of the largest grossing live tours in Britain's theater history.  This is a must have!  Sketches are fresh and some delightful surprises.  In Special features, ""The Big Swim"" Documentary of David Walliam's triumphant swim across the English Channel for Sport/Comic Relief. It's truly inspiring. Enjoy.",1233014400,,314,5.638297872340425
8175610,5,B000N8UY1E,"I am a long time fan of Matt and David's zany characterizations.  I prefer British humor to any other in the world!  This DVD was the funniest yet!  New material not seen in any of their series' episodes was presented during their expertly timed comic performances.  They even included unassuming volunteers from the audience in several of their skits and handled other audience hecklers with great aplomb!  I laughed all the way though! I won't spoil the end for you, but it goes out with a great big BANG!",1186099200,,507,4.651685393258427
