8047999,1,B0007LC57I,"I think it's pretty obvious the 5 star reviews are not real. I have other Steve Kaufman tutorials and like them but there is very little ""instruction"" on this. Basically ""learn a ton of fiddle tunes, here's the tab for a few and then figure out the rest for yourself"".
It has a chart for learning chords up and down the neck. That's nice but it's a DVD on improvising solos. His advice for learning how to play these tunes in other keys is ""you figure it out"":. Very frustrating and I'm very disappointed and feel like I've really wasted my money..",1446681600,,548,4.382352941176471
8048000,5,B0007LC57I,"I own couple of Steve's videos, among them this one. They're all great 'cause Steve is a patient teacher emphasizing all the important points. And for this one I'm truly grateful: it's a wonderful insight into a mind and technique of an improvising master flatpicker. I was always wondering how those guys actually do it, and this is a true revelation. Steve does not only telling you how it's being done but also how to get there. Of course, there is no magic wand, and Steve himself tells you there's no shortcut; it's a journey that takes a long time and never ends. A worthy piece of advice: do not get frustrated and always enjoy playing your guitar. I watched through this video and I think that the method is great (and I think I never heard better closing words of encouragement :)). So I'm back to the beginning, learning all those fiddle tunes. See you in a couple of years from now :).",1253059200,,896,4.469512195121951
8048001,5,B0007LC57I,"I am primarily a fiddler by trade...and I should be, but was not, that familiar with Steve Kaufman.  This DVD blew me away!!!  I have a repertoire of over 500 fiddle tunes, and he believes this was the ""key"" to learning to play all over the fingerboard.  Well, here he shows the METHOD to such madness, and it makes sense!!!  He says that at ""intermediate-advanced"" guitar camps and seminars he'll find such players who typically know less than 10 fiddle tunes.  He explains why learning fiddle tunes, NOT scales, is the key to playing like Steve, Doc Watson, and other great melody players (Blake, Rice, C. White come to mind)...

This will be the best $29.95 you spend, it is worth months if not years of lessons.  I now can see my guitar picking (flatpicking) really picking up steam.  Steve is encouraging, not in an overly folksy or put-on way, and his OM-42 (Collings) matches the sound of my OM-1 (probably Adirondack) like sequential serial-numbered guitars--so it is just fun to play along with Steve.

Buy it!!!  If you aspire to playing above the 7th fret, this DVD is a must see and hear!!!",1203292800,11,1102,4.634020618556701
8048002,2,B0007LC57I,"The description to this DVD should identify it as ""For Beginners"" I've been playing most of my life and I was looking for something more than this DVD offers.
If you are a beginner, this will teach you a bunch.",1192924800,4,210,4.275
8048003,1,B0007LC57I,"If you're looking for any actual help in figuring out the fingerboard, look elsewhere.  Kaufman's first bit of instruction is to ""go out and learn 50 fiddle tunes and then come back to this DVD.""  Uh huh.",1187913600,4,204,4.486486486486487
8048004,5,B0007LC57I,I don't think this guy has a degree in education but deserves a honorary doctorate for this video. He knows how to teach!,1149379200,2,121,4.304347826086956
8048005,5,B0007LC57I,"A friend recommended Steve Kaufman's instructional guitar DVD's to me about a year ago. I started with the three DVD set ""Learning to Flatpick"", a must-have for any flatpicking student. I added ""The Art of Guitar Crosspicking"" and ""Picking Up Speed.""

Steve provides slowed-down versions of tunes, as well as easy-to-read tablature.""Figuring Out the Fingerboard"" continues the excellent series. Steve's easy-going manner, and desire to help the struggling and accomplished students alike are evident in his teaching methodology. His picking technique is clean and simple. I've learned more in the past year than I have in the past ten, thanks to Steve's DVD's. My picking confidence and tune repertoire have definitely been ramped up.

Pick up this one, and start playing ""up the neck"" in no time flat.",1126051200,7,802,5.2578125
8048006,5,B0007LC57I,There is lots to know about the guitar and this DVD helped tremedously. It's nice to be able to re-play scenes that I have trouble with. This is a great tool to learn more about how to play bluegrass and improvise with other players.,1121731200,3,233,4.318181818181818
