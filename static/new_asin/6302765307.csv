In this tale, Mother Goose's book gets eaten by a bookworm and she needs the gangs help to reconstruct the damaged pages.
The video is short and from one of the old shows.  If you have see more recent Barney's you will note that this is a different Mother Goose than now appears.
That said, this video is popular with my 2 and 4 year olds.  (Boy and Girl.)  However, if you really want a treat, check out ""Rhyme Time Rhythm"" on DVD.  Alot more poems and a cooler set along with additional materials.",1089849600,7,527,4.292929292929293

7831470,4,6302765307,"While it takes a little time for adults to get used to the older ""style"" Barney, with simpler sets and outdated clothing, a preschooler will hardly care what it looks like and may actually prefer it to something more flashy.  The 2-4 age group will love helping Mother Goose remember all sorts of nursery rhymes and songs and will be able to learn some of the simple choreography too.  I know my 3 year old wants to watch it every day!",1115856000,,435,4.3580246913580245
