8160517,5,B000LA85II,It is a very good workout.,1430611200,,26,3.5
8160518,4,B000LA85II,"Much better than the beginner DVD's.  This is a good yoga flow workout.  Definitely will help to tone your core and assist in developing fundamentals to carry onto more advanced postures.  I think any yoga practice at home is always more difficult than in studio because you are forced to align yourself and work through your own practice without guidance.  This DVD is a good tool to use strictly for building strength.  None of the postures are incredibly difficult making it easy to focus on posture, alignment and building strength.  These elements are key when it comes to moving into more advanced postures.",1423008000,3,613,4.902912621359223
8160519,5,B000LA85II,This is the best use of time to get in shape!!!  Yoga poses with strength training focus - love that!,1415750400,,101,4.05
8160520,5,B000LA85II,"""I love It"" because it was ""as advertised"". The DVD gets right to the program. Easy to follow instruction. Beth reminds us to work at our own pace, focusing on ourselves, and encourages us throughout the video. I have been using Beth Shaw's ""Supine Warm-up"" for years. With encouragement from my daughter-in-law and yoga instructor, I am expanding my horizons! I will be adding more YogaFit DVDs to my yoga library. Thank you",1370217600,,425,4.835616438356165
8160521,5,B000LA85II,"I love this DVD.  I like the fact that there is no meditation period, I like to start stretching and working out right away.  Instructor is great in explaining proper body alignment, flow from one pose to another is smooth, I just love this one.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.",1248220800,8,284,4.423076923076923
8160522,5,B000LA85II,"I would describe this particular DVD as a more intermediate Yogafit workout.  Not beginner, as they have a beginner Yogafit DVD by Beth Shaw.  The Yoga Basics DVD is a good place to start--I did it that way.  And, then I got this DVD (Flex and Flow) once I mastered the beginning Yoga DVD and could do it without stopping and felt I needed a more advanced Yoga DVD.  Since Flex and Flow is a more intermediate Yoga,  you also won't get too frustrated by going up to a higher level--taking Yoga one step at a time is the best way to be successful.  And. always remembering that this is a practice.  And, therefore whatever you do--while going at your own pace and pushing yourself a little at a time is still a very successful practice.  I highly recommended Beth Shaw also as an instructor.  Her voice is pleasing and her music selection is good.  I have many Yoga DVD's that have been difficult to use because of the voice and lack of instruction.--And, with this DVD that isn't a concern.",1245801600,18,990,4.419889502762431
8160523,5,B000LA85II,"This DVD is just outstanding, the flow is easy and you can follow along even if you are a beginner.",1245628800,2,99,4.0
8160524,5,B000LA85II,I love this workout because it's a little different than what I normally do. This is a very easy to follow conditioning routine and Beth Shaw is just so encouraging and explains everything very well.,1234828800,3,199,4.714285714285714
8160525,4,B000LA85II,My yoga teacher recommended this workout for times I could not attend class. This is well suited for beginners who are more interested in the physical rather than spiritual dimensions of yoga practice.,1208736000,13,201,5.121212121212121
