5256339,4,B0093OFLNU,"A charming, little-known opera in which Domingo's subtlety is superb. Memorable story about poet Pablo Neruda told well in drama and music.",1362355200,2,139,5.363636363636363
5256340,3,B0093OFLNU,"After reading the almost unanimous 5* reviews I purchased, expecting to really like. But after a while of watching, I was disappointed.  The English translation of the poetry I found to be repetitive and not poetic.  Placido has become overweight, paunchy and sings from forte to forte.  I admire him for the many great performances of the past and his contributions to opera, but feel at this point in his career he should stick to conducting.  The 3* are for Charles Castronovo and Amanda Squitieri, who I found to be very appealing as singers and actors.  But the negatives of the translation and Placido detract too much from my enjoyment.

Update:  Did more research and learned that Placido was a long time friend and champion of the composer, Daniel Catan.  So without Placido, this opera probably would not exist.  This back story adds much to the emotional involvement and impact of the opera.  Makes me appreciate it more.  Also, the sets and direction are quite wonderful.  I now have a better appreciation of all the positive reviews.  That said, taken at its face value, without the back story, it's still a slow-paced, snoozer of an opera, and Placido still looks and performs like a beached whale.  Sorry.",1360022400,8,1220,4.830917874396135
5256341,3,B0093OFLNU,"The opera was OK and Placido Domingo has a beautiful voice and great acting skills. But, I could not get into the Communist theme. Maybe this would be popular in Cuba or Venezuela, and of course Los Angeles. CA has turned into a nut house!",1356566400,3,239,4.333333333333333
5256342,5,B0093OFLNU,"This is a truly bveautiful and touching opera with music throughout that is heart-warmiong.  Many 21st Century operas are not necessarily as beautiful as this piece.  I hope it will be performed at venues in the future, as I will attend.  Thankfully, it has been preserved on DVD for future posterity.",1353542400,2,301,4.862745098039215
5256343,5,B0093OFLNU,"This is yet another excellent DVd from the Master---Placido Domingo. Full value for money; story-telling at its best. A different genre from his usual, more traditional Operas, but very enjoyable.",1353283200,3,196,5.566666666666666
5256344,5,B0093OFLNU,"I confess I hated the movie.  However, I was completely swept off my feet by this operatic version, which does away with the comedic elements of the original and distills its essence: true poetry comes from the soul, and its heart is metaphor.  Placido Domingo and Charles Castronovo have natural chemistry together and both give their all.  Catn provides an enchanting score.  I do hope some of his other three operas get into DVD.",1352764800,3,432,4.797297297297297
5256345,5,B0093OFLNU,"... of the 21st Century! With ""Il Postino,"" Mexican composer Daniel Cat&aacute;n has crafted an opera closer in both music and drama to the operas of Puccini than to those of Stravinsky, Berg, or Prokofiev, not to mention Glass or Adams! It's not post-modern; it's as if modernism never happened! And guess what? It works! It's a moving piece of narrative theater, made powerful by the brilliant ACTING of Pl&aacute;cido Domingo as Pablo Neruda and Charles Castronovo as the rural postman Mario. The Spanish-language libretto stays quite close to the Italian cinema Il Postino, but the character portrayals in the opera are even better than those in the film. I almost forgot that the singing poet on stage wasn't really Neruda, so well did Domingo capture his affect both in music and in ""figura."" The poignant tragedy of the narrative left Domingo visibly crying during his curtain calls. No applause could be adequate for the character performance of Castronovo as the Little Postman; he's as innocent, as tongue-tied, and as genuinely passionate as the role demands, and he sings as well as his obvious idol Neruda/Domingo.

The music! Of course it's the music that matters most, and it's such music as allows both Domingo and Castronovo to soar vocally. The supporting roles, especially the Postman's Beatrice sung by Amanda Squitieri, are acted and sung with equal excellence. There are delightful minor highlights, musically and theatrically, enough to supercharge the central melodrama of this opera. Take note, for instance, of the surprise 'blessing' sung by Mario's Father (Gabriel Osuna); it's a musically authentic Corsican-style chant.

All of this is sustained by very capable stage business -- good sets, good costuming, good lighting, etc. -- and excellent camerawork for this DVD. Il Postino is an opera that should find a niche in the scheduling of opera companies around the world for at least the next generation.

One painful footnote: composer Daniel Cat&aacute;n died at age 52 in 2011, just months after the LA premiere of Il Postino.",1352073600,6,2059,5.140298507462687
5256346,5,B0093OFLNU,"What was beloved by audiences in the  live production of Daniel Catn's opera `IL POSTINO' at the LA Opera is finally available on DVD and the result is an even greater appreciation for this new opera.

Born in Mexico City in 1949, Daniel Catn was, until his untimely death on April 8, 2011, one of the foremost composers in contemporary opera (La Hija de Rappacini (Rappaccini's Daughter), Florencia en el Amazonas, loosely based on Gabriel Garca Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera, and Salsipuedes. Speaking of his fourth opera, Il Postino, the composer recalled, ""I realized, from the very first time I saw the film, that it was a suitable theme for an opera. It deals with Art and Love: the foundations upon which we build our lives. Love is what makes us human. Art is our most sophisticated tool for achieving that humanity. And opera is one of the most complete art forms ever imagined, for it includes music and poetry.""

Based on the Academy Award-winning 1994 Italian film that became a surprise hit with audiences around the world, and also on the 1985 novel Ardiente Paciencia by Antonio Skrmeta, Il Postino tells the story of a shy young postman Mario Puoppolo (tenor Charles Castronovo) in a tiny Italian fishing village, who discovers the courage to pursue his dreams through his daily deliveries to his only customer, the esteemed Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, played by Placido Domingo. Mario falls in love with a caf waitress Beatrice Russo (Amanda Squitieri) and wins her heart by using the poetic language (explained in a fine duet for Domino and Castronovo -`Metaphors'.

Other performers include soprano Cristina Gallardo-Doms as the poet's wife Matilde Neruda, baritone Vladimir Chernov as the postmaster Giorgio and mezzo-soprano Nancy Fabiola Herrera as Donna Rosa, Beatrice's aunt. Grant Gershon conducts the LA Opera Orchestra, Ron Daniels directs, the sets and costumes are by Riccardo Hernandez, and the imaginative lighting and projections are the work of Jennifer Tipton and Philip Bussman.

Though the opera may not find a permanent place in the opera repertoires around the world, the piece is accessible, tender, the characters are well drawn and the realization of the film by Michael Radford is excellent. Domingo is especially fine as Pablo Neruda, but the real finds of the opera is Charles Castronovo, a superb young tenor, and Amanda Squitieri, a soprano whose beautiful stage presence is matched by a clear and passionate voice. The opera is well worth hearing and seeing bothe in person and now in this very well made DVD. Grady Harp, October 12",1351468800,8,2586,5.004651162790697
5256347,5,B0093OFLNU,"I had the privilege of attending this opera when it premiered in Los Angeles.  Placido Domingo fits the mentor role very well as he passes the torch on to his counterpart, Charles Castronovo.  The opera follows the plot of the movie pretty closely with the exception that it is sung in Spanish.  Penned by the recently deceased Mexican-American composer, Daniel Cat&aacute;n. this was his final work. Often compared to the stylings of Puccini and Debussy, you'll find a very lush romantic score with some complexities that will sound like film music to most. With a great supporting cast, they bring to life the parallel storylines of romance and politics. However, I really loved the chemistry between Domingo and Castronovo, and the growth of their two characters.  The young lyric tenor sings with a heart of noble sincerity, which is coupled well with the prolific wisdom of Domingo's voice.  Even if you are not the usual opera fan, you will find this modern story accessible, and of course there are subtitles in English. I would also keep a lookout for Castronovo as he continues to be one of the great lyric tenors of our generation.",1350518400,11,1141,4.860824742268041
5256348,5,B0093OFLNU,I saw this Opera on CBS last fall and REALLY enjoyed it!!! It was a wonderful production; music written in a traditional way.  I have been lookiing forward for the DVD forever!!! So glad it's available now!!!  I've just placed my order and hope to have it soon!!!,1350259200,2,263,4.458333333333333
8535280,5,B0093OFLNU,"A very touching opera reminiscent of Puccinis, of Fanciulla in particular. The libretto is based on a fictional story taken from the movie of the same name. Pablo Neruda, the Chilean Nobel Prize winner, is real, as well as some of the poem excerpts used in the libretto, but the story is fictional, it never happened. Domingo as Neruda is perfect for the role. In fact Catan composed this opera for Domingo as commissioned by the Los Angeles Opera.  The production is just perfect, using some very effective technologies like projections and the like.  A pleasure to watch. The real hero of this production is Charles Castronove as Mario, the Il Postino (the mail man).  His acting and singing are beautiful and he really gets into his character.  Puccini was known for his tragic while adorable female characters, like Mimi, Cio-Cio San and Manon. Catans Mario falls into the same category.
The music is very melodic, a surprise for a modern opera premiered in 2010. It fits perfect with the characters and their emotions. Very touching.
Note, Il Postino is sung in Spanish. The poetic lyrics may lose some into English translation.
Highly recommended.",1521244800,,1153,4.927835051546392

This one will go down in history as one of the best contemporary works and recordings. I loved the story, and it was a hoot to see Domingo as Neruda.",1451347200,,307,4.581818181818182

8535284,5,B0093OFLNU,"Here we have a true gem, where the younger characters are played and sung by younger artists, and the older characters by older artists.  No middle-aged trying to pass as 20-somethings, as we have almost everywhere else :)  So what if Domingo is over 70 and a little paunchy ... it fits the character.  All of them are supremely well cast.  And where did they get these supreme young singers??  O yes, now about the communist activist subplot.  Didn't affect my enjoyment in the least.  It was a slice of life, of a different time and place, and I was happy to see the story from beginning to end.",1404172800,2,597,4.422018348623853
8535285,4,B0093OFLNU,"I was pleasantly surprised, many modern operas are devoid of the melodies you are used to hearing from the past. this piece has many of these musical qualities, having placido playing Neruda was also a plus. the rest of the cast performed beautifly. I was also impressed by how closely they followed the movie script, I loved the movie, seeing placidos' emotions at the operas end confirmed my feelings.to anyone who hasn't seen both the movie and the opera, you are missing something very special.",1400630400,,498,4.870588235294117
8535286,5,B0093OFLNU,"Bravo!
At last a truly melodic modern work yet in musical phasing akin to Massenet. I liked the original movie but I love this opera. I compared the libretto, it is almost word for word opera to movie. There are some subtle changes but all for the better.
The cast in this LA Opera is superb. Domingo and Castronovo are perfectly chosen and are well supported. The orchestra under the baton of Grant Gershon never dominates providing great audio.
All is directed by Brian Large.
The final scene is most memorable, Domingo, tears coursing down his cheeks as Castronovo begins their final duet. Perfect theatre!
In taking their final bows Domingo & Castronovo come from opposite wings together and at the last moment Domingo thrusts Castronovo forward to take his bow alone. A class act.
I'm grateful that the composer, Daniel Catan was able to take his final bow and was present to see his work so ravishingly produced and received by the audience. His death a terrible loss for music lovers.
I possess a very large collection of opera on Dvd and BluRay. My collection would be incomplete without this production of IL Postino. KenH",1377561600,2,1131,4.775510204081633

8535288,5,B0093OFLNU,"Like most operas, this one is a heartbreaker. ""Il Postino,"" (The Postman) is a modern day opera by Mexican composer Daniel Catan. It's set on an island in Italy and based on the 1994 foreign film of the same name by Michael Radford and from the book ""Ardiente Paciencia"" (Burning Patience) by Antonio Skarmata. The lyrics are sung in Spanish. Subtitles can be added on screen in English or Spanish.

Two great tenors are required to make this opera a success and this production from Los Angeles Opera has them in Placido Domingo as the famous real-life Nobelist poet Pablo Neruda and Charles Castronovo as the cheeky postman. The final moments of the duet between these two artists is incomparable as they blend their voices in absolute perfection.

Daniel Catan's score is melodic and in the genre of Giacomo Puccini's ""La Rondine"" (The Swallow). The story touches the heart and Catan uses it like a Stradivarius in the telling.

The seemingly idyllic life that Pablo Neruda leads in Italy during his exile there from his native Chile, masks the peril inherent in his political assertiveness and expressive freedoms. Romantic impulses prompt the postman to wish to become a poet. Neruda complies by teaching Mario about metaphors. When Neruda recites a poem to him, the postman describes feeling strangely seasick as the rhythm of the words move him like a boat on the sea. The poet exclaims ""Mario, Do you know what you have made? A metaphor."" The transformation begins.

The postman wins his lady love through poetry but the price of emulating Neruda is steep. Shortly before their son is born, Mario Ruoppolo's life is taken in a martyr's death. He is shot while reading a poem he wrote when a riot spontaneously erupts at a political rally.

It is not mentioned in the opera, but I read in the March 6, 2013, issue of The Philadelphia Inquirer that the body of Pablo Neruda is to be exhumed in Chile to determine whether he was murdered by lethal injection. He died there in 1983, just twelve days after a political rival came into power.

The opera concludes with Pablo Neruda reading from the postman's journal about the poem he wrote of the sea and dedicated to Neruda in gratitude. As the poet laments, the phantom of Mario Ruoppolo appears. This incredible moment crowns the opera and makes the DVD a collector's item. It's hard to imagine two other tenors blending their voices so beautifully to sound as one in the closing duet. This DVD is a keeper.",1371081600,2,2463,4.756440281030445
8535289,5,B0093OFLNU,Vey nice to hear an Opera in my native language. I liked the  production from LA Opera. Singing was excellent and I was touched a few times by some of its beauty. I wish Met Opera of New York dear to present something in spanish like they do in Los Angeles and Houston grand Opera. Very refreshing and Original without the usual nonsense on stage.,1370563200,,347,4.338461538461538
