7970846,5,B00006JY3H,"I saw this movie on Public TV around 1980 and loved it, but today it's only available on a Region 2/PAL DVD manufactured for the UK market.  So I also bought a SAMSUNG BDF-5700 Multi Region DVD Blu ray Player so I could watch it.  The DVD and player arrived 8 days later in the same package.  The SAMSUNG worked right out of the box with no problems or set up, and played the DVD perfectly, converting it automatically.  I watched the entire movie and the bonus material.  The DVD was evidently made from a restored print, since the picture and sound were perfect.  And there were no problems related to this DVD being Region 2 or PAL.",1406937600,3,635,4.338983050847458
7970847,5,B00006JY3H,"A dream cast - from the point of a filmed version of the play.
Pleasance acts 360 degrees - the eyes, the body language the voice - it's all there.
Bates is the slightly crazy random, impulsive but deeply troubled brother in the wings.
And Shaw - magnificent Shaw - in a tremendously powerful portrayal - of course he's slow, what else - and a central monologue about ECT that is absolutely stunning. (It makes you look at the 1950s and early 1960s again in a different light) Everything else is a bonus after that.

The most significant point is reached where Shaw says his mother signed the paper. When you are surrendered to the state, or a state run institution, that is the end. Anything can happen. See our treatment of the elderly in care homes in the UK. Everything in the play seems to proceed from this act of abandonment. Of course, ECT is now out of favour, but there is the chemical cosh...
The extras on the DVD are good too. The scene with the two brothers sharing a silent time in the garden, around the pond, observed by Pleasance from an upstairs window being apparently a favourite.

Of course, it has comical elements, but it is deadly serious power play between three individuals with one loser who you knew from the start. You haven't got everything here. But where is there enough with theatrical gems like this? But who cares?
It is enough to get 5 stars, repeated viewings and enough to find a rightful place in any record of Pinter's works.

This filmed version of the play will be watched anew by countless generations into the future making their own assessment of Pinter as a British post-war playwright. They will find much truth in it.",1391212800,2,1666,4.546666666666667
7970848,4,B00006JY3H,"Filmed during the freezing winter of 1963, Clive Donner's THE CARETAKER is a faithful translation of Pinter's groundbreaking stage play. In cinematic terms, it perhaps lacks interest, but it preserves for ever the wonderful performance of Donald Pleasance as Davies, the tramp entering Aston's and Mick's lives. Alternately dominant, wheedling, plaintive, irritating and attention-seeking, he commands the viewer's attention throughout the film. Ably supported by Alan Bates, the film should be approached as a piece of filmed theater.",1345852800,2,535,5.871794871794871
7970849,5,B00006JY3H,I have alway's loved this film and I've only seen it on PBS two or three times since the early 1980's. I consider it Robert Shaw's finest performance. When...when will this be available on DVD in this country? Why the hold up?,1204588800,7,226,4.404761904761905
7970850,5,B00006JY3H,"Recently watching an interview with Eric Clapton in which he is talking about his relationship with his former band-mate John Mayall and the old days when they were in the band The Bluesbreakers together and at one point in the interview Eric talks about their mutual love for this movie. I thought his remarks were interesting so am including them here...

""One thing that we have in common, still have in common is that we were both obsessed and knew by heart the script of The Caretaker. We were big fans of Pinter. That one particular movie that they made The Caretaker with Donald Pleasence became our bible. We would quote that...and either I would be Jenkins, or he would be Jenkins, and we'd take turns playing different characters. I still watch that movie and go back to those days. It facinates me. It's a great piece of work. It's very hard to find these days, that piece of film.

 But that was a real common bond for us. It was a love of the absurd. There's a lot of bizarre eccentricities about those people which has to do with real life, and i guess now that I look at it, a lot to do with manipulative  behavior, and/or the human condition, which I think we're both quite interested in...facinated with.""",1175644800,9,1222,4.515837104072398
7970851,5,B00006JY3H,"Clive Donner directed this singular project with three singual and talented actors. Donald Shuterland is an old derelict who is invited to spend the night in a rundown London house with two neurotic brothers.

A promising chamber work which explores the dark corners of the human soul. Think about; we are talking about Harold Pinter this true scalpel of the human psyche. As curious fact this work was financed by Noel Coward, Richard Burton. Elizabeth taylor, Peter Sellers and Leslie Caron.",1145836800,6,493,5.08641975308642
