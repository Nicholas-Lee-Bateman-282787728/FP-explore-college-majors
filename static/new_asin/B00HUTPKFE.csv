6225244,5,B00HUTPKFE,This is one of my favorite documentaries.  It captures the intensity and intelligence of an animal which amazes me.  This Nature program held my full attention all the way through.  I believe animal lovers and people drawn to documentaries will enjoy this.  I'm surprised there are not more reviews.,1399852800,6,299,5.040816326530612
6225245,3,B00HUTPKFE,"This documentary could speak to people for two reasons.  First, those who root for David over Goliath will like this.  The badger is shown chasing and scaring giraffes, lions, and rhinos.  They can take on lions, aka the kings of beasts.  Second, the badgers seem smart.  They are like dolphins and octopuses.  Many people like seeing that video of a squirrel going through a 10-phase obstacle course just to get to some nuts.  Here we see a badger in a walled-off encampment using branches, bricks, and rocks to set themselves free.  Further, a beekeeper tries all kinds of things to keep a badger from destroying his hives and nothing works.
People who enjoyed the doc Raccoon Nation will also like this.  Like the raccoons, this doc shows badgers being able to enter houses, open refrigerators and wreak domestic havoc.  The doc notes that the badger has the same colors as a skunk and can also produce a powerful stink.  However, I was surprised that Tasmanian devils were never brought up because these badgers seemed equally pugnacious.
I was fascinated by the coupling seen here.  The work repeats more than once that if you see two badgers, it is more likely to be a mother and son, rather than a heterosexual pair.  The work never explains if badgers tend to have singletons or multiple births.  It seems that they raise their young for a long time.  It actually reminded me of how guinea pigs gestate their young much longer than other rodents and thus their young come out with hair and seem more developed.  You see an adult male approach a mother and son and start getting busy with the mother.  If you're a human male that would never want to see your mother getting busy with a man, this may be an awkward clip to watch.  However, the work does say this is the act that informs the son its time to head out on its own.  In fact, the son and the new male that just got busy seem to pair up to fight some larger felines.
Heres the shocking thing.  I support biodiversity as much as the next wannabe environmentalist, don't get me wrong.  However, it seemed like the badger would be a pest.  It would seem to me that farmers could rightfully say, I cant have an animal around that I cant keep in a cage, who ruins beehives, and attacks other species.  Being a pest is why farmers killed off passenger pigeons and Tasmanian dogs.  I wouldnt want that to happen to badgers, but the work never explains how this creature can survive without farmers knocking them off.",1396742400,6,2476,4.549773755656108

8636044,5,B00HUTPKFE,"One of the best wildlife documentaries I've ever watched.  We've watched this one several times now, and it's always just as good as the first time.",1437523200,,148,4.6923076923076925
8636045,5,B00HUTPKFE,"This show is a lot of fun.  Watch the badgers go after their favorite snacks and prey.  Living on the savanahs they also have to fend off hyenas and the like.  How can these racoon-size creatures do it?  The show reveals how this happens.  Plus you'll get to meet Stoffel at a private nature reserve.

As tough at these little ones are, there is still a need for people and beekeepers to share the savannah and its resources.  Let's hope that beekeepers and honey customers can also appreciate these incredible honey badgers.",1418428800,,525,4.641304347826087
