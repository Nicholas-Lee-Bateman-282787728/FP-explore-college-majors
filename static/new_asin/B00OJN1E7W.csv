The last two GANG members are ""pals"" of Benny on parole..... ADDED fun is that Talman and Jergens are lovers. Talman's ability to avoid detection is moving from place to place. ...""not even a parking ticket"" on his record makes him the BRAINS of the GANG ~ The ROBBERY starts with a gas bomb going off near the Armored Car and the money being loaded into a CAR~ when homicide Detective Charles McGraw and his partner get to the robbery faster than the plan. ONE detective ends up dead and BAD guy BENNY is shot. The gang change cars and leave plenty of blood and clues under a bridge. Next they avoid a roadblock and end up on the waterfront.

The KEY here is JERGENS so the police 'wire' her car and dressing room hoping to find the missing money AND the elusive Talman. This is an excellent movie. McGraw is first rate as the hard nosed detective. Talman is the cold blooded methodical planner is perfect and scene stealer here is Adele Jergens who is excellent as the Stipper who loves money. 5 STAR all the way~~ excellent plot. Talman is first rate as the BRAINS who plans the near perfect heist. LOOK for the ingenius PHONE booth ..""contacts"" between Jergen and Talman.",1424476800,,1937,4.5501432664756445
