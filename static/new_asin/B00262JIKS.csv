But I added two stars, one as a tribute to Shakespear's great play, and another to say thank you to Amazon for refunding my money without having asked for it when my old computer messed up my reception.  Now that's classy service.",1351987200,,258,4.468085106382978
3850562,1,B00262JIKS,"This is literally a depressing production.  What would make anyone think there was humor in an English Quaker muted-toned Taming of the Shrew?  Cleese could have done a lot with some imagination but apparently the powers-that-be set out to completely kill any comedy in his performance.  The casting of Kate was a mistake she was too old and unlikeable for the part and if he had clobbered her at least it would have put some life in the show.  This is supposed to be ribald comedy, that's how the BARD wrote it and what he wrote was funny but you wouldn't know it from the way they just rattle off the dialogue.  This production has no energy nor creativity and is not worth purchasing.",1342396800,2,687,4.508064516129032
3850563,4,B00262JIKS,"Enjoyed this version of the Shrew.  The pacing in the first fifteen minutes seems off.  The lines are read at a gallop and without enough clarity.  The pacing does settle for the rest of the play and the lines are better delivered.  Settings, costumes and cast are wonderful.  Mr Cleese made a fine Petrucchio.  One of the other reviewers complained about the age of the actress who plays Kate.  Dude, this is Shakespeare!  It is like opera.  You have to get beyond appearance and listen to the way the cast presents the poetry of the bard.  When the play was first presented the female roles were all played by men.  The costuming and scenery were not extravagant and the audience had to use imagination and mind to view the play.  Close your eyes and listen to the words if the actress does not look like a teenager.  I have not seen this play in some time so had forgotten the strong message that this male dominated world delivers about women.  Here too the viewer must remember that this play is 400 years old.  In spite of the message about the subservient woman we have to remember it comes from the time of Eliabeth I who is probably one of the strongest and most inspiring women of that age.",1340323200,5,1200,4.440366972477064
3850564,4,B00262JIKS,"Jonathon Miller is a master in bringing highly talented actors together to perform in a serious role. John Cleese is like no other Petruchio and my favourite.
I had seen this production on BBC in 1987 and loved it. When I finally tracked it down on Amazon I was thrilled. Watching it again after so many years is always a risk but I wasn't disappointed. Even my reluctant daughter (24) enjoyed it too. A gem!",1266105600,12,408,4.453333333333333
3850565,5,B00262JIKS,"I rented this from the library ages ago.  Years later, I tried to track it down; it proved very difficult.  I ended up finding it here.  Note that the DVD format will not play on standard North American DVD players.  You must have region 2 or 4, or an all-regions DVD player.  Luckily I have one and it played just fine.  This version was filmed on a sound stage, so if you are looking for blockbuster sets and outdoor scenes, you won't find it here. If you want to see John Cleese doing Shakespeare, and doing a fine job at it, this is for you.  I've seen other versions of The Taming of the Shrew, but I have to say John Cleese is my favorite Petrucio and the actress who played Kate (I can't recall her name) is my favorite Kate.",1257984000,7,732,4.148936170212766
3850566,4,B00262JIKS,"I like to show this version of ""Shrew"" to contrast it with the commedia dell'arte production done by the American Conservatory Theater. Both versions have so much to commend them.

This BBC version is really entertaining. I love the subtle directorial differences here -- you really get the clue early on that Bianca is the real shrew in the family; Kate is the misunderstood, passed over elder sister. Sarah Badel is really witty as Katherine. Her louds screams of fury resound offstage as John Cleese's Petruchio says, ""Pray, have you not a daughter called Katherina, fair and virtuous?""

John Franklyn-Robbins as Baptista Minola pauses diffidently as the outraged shrieking continues and answers hesitantly, ""I have a daughter, sir, called Katherina...""

Perfect comedic timing. The rest of the movie is just as well done. It's actually very romantic as well. At the end, you see Kate and Petruchio as equals in their marriage, presenting the public face that society demands they show, while knowing that they are true soul mates in their private life together.

There is no Induction in this version, by the way.",1203292800,6,1117,5.054347826086956
3850567,5,B00262JIKS,"This is the most romantic and touching Shrew on film.  Here, Petruchio is a sly and thoughtful man who really does care for Kate and knows how to make her his own and give her access to her own happiness.

This is also John Cleese's best acting in his entire career, and I've seen a lot of it.  He is charming and subdued here.  His performance will knock you flat.",1198022400,18,365,4.171428571428572
3850568,2,B00262JIKS,"Alas, John Cleese, the star of this show, misses the mark here, and Sarah Badel, as Katherine, is not only too old for the part but plays her less as a shrew than an alternately abused or abusive mental patient.  Perhaps it's her ""advanced"" age, but I'd never imagined Kate crying, and this mature woman in tears does not advance the comedy.  In my opinion, the best Shrew out there is the 1976 TV version, still available on Amazon, starring Marc Singer of ""Beastmaster"" fame.  It's athletic, bawdy, energetic -- and funny!",1190592000,5,524,4.673913043478261
3850569,1,B00262JIKS,"Seemed like a typical low budget BBC production as opposed to to their more elaborate productions.  So it should have been average; however, having a monty python star as Petruchio was too much.  It was so out of character that it bothered me all through the production.  John Cleese was just wrong for the part.",1444176000,,312,4.636363636363637

3850572,5,B00262JIKS,"I have not purchased this tape from this vendor so my review is solely on the actual production, which I videotaped decades back from the Arts & Entertainment Network.  In a nutshell, this production is brilliant.  It is expertly directed for the stage to the point where I don't think there is any more room for improvement.  The directing for the camera is professionally and logically handled making both directors' efforts gel seemlessly.  As for the acting, it is perfection in interpretation and comedic timing.  Heading the production are Len Cariou's  fantastic and commanding Petruchio and Sharry Flett fiery and vulnerable Katrina.  Barney O'Sullivan's Baptista is also perfection; a true joy to watch.  You will probably recognize three of these stars from television and film:  The first being Len Cariou (making me wish I saw his Sweeney Todd), the second being Lynne Griffin (excellent as Bianca) and lastly Colm Feore portraying Tranio.  It's hard to start picking out other standout performers because the entire cast is spot on.

I rewatched this because a local theatre is putting on a production of The Taming of the Shrew and i am surprised at how much I literally laughed out loud and spent the rest of the time with a smile on my face totally impressed with the production.

If you are looking for an excellent production of this play to watch, I highly recommend this one.  Yes, this is on VHS tape but until this is put out on DVD and if you still have a VHS player, run to pick up this version.",1438128000,,1519,4.751908396946565
3850573,5,B00262JIKS,This is my favorite recorded production of The Taming of the Shrew. Cleese makes the show. I should have bought a copy when I first saw it. It sees to be out of print .,1436832000,,168,3.8285714285714287
3850574,3,B00262JIKS,"I have seen this play performed twice, and although it is interpreted as a cold-hearted rant, it is very funny when performed. I was watching the reaction of the audience members, and everyone enjoyed it, including those that were not very familiar with the work. However, the dry humor of the play doesn't translate to this production. I personally like John Cleese, but he just doesn't quite fit the part of Petruchio. Part of the problem is that you really don't know if you are supposed to love him or hate him. In a stage production with a very likable actor, you don't have that problem. However, for those that are looking for an adaptation that is fairly faithful to the text, this is a safe production. Frankly, the Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton movie is more fun. Looking forward to the new version with Anne Hatheway, with fingers crossed.",1435017600,,856,4.713333333333333
3850575,2,B00262JIKS,"The BBCs Shakespeare Collection film has a lot of nice details and comic touches, but unfortunately, the big picture is a little out of focus; someone seems to have lost sight of the forest in favour of the trees. The performance never seems to decide quite what its angle is on the question of exactly how the play is to be taken, or just what to make of the relationship between Kate and Petruchio; it feels a bit sporadic and aimless.

The trouble starts with the Induction, which is entirely cut. This inevitably gets the performance off to a bad start, and makes any meaningful interpretation close to impossible, since it does so much to define the nature of the play. The scenes setting up the reasons for Kates shrewishness are understated or cut altogether, which only makes matters worse; and there is no real chemistry between her and Petruchio, compounding the problems of interpretation. The scene where they first meet never captures the right tone; this is fatal to any production. You get the feeling the actors don't quite know what to do with the lines.

A lot of small lapses make things worse. The Gremio is too young; the Hortensio is too old. Tranio is also on the old side, though it doesnt matter much, and hes otherwise quite good. John Cleese, as Petruchio, doesnt seem quite comfortable in Shakespeare or in real acting, though given where hes coming from, he acquits himself pretty well, and he gets better as the play progresses; he has a couple of strong moments. The Lucentio is not quite right either; he comes across as too whiny and too wimpy.

As always with the BBC, there are positives. The scene between the pedants and Bianca is quite well done, though the Hortensio mars it a bit. Cleeses tone in the speech about the falcon does add some useful interpretation. The Minolas house is made up to look like a Vermeer; its a nice effect, though Im not quite sure what Vermeer was doing in Padua forty years before his birth (though again, it doesn't much matter). In general, the performance gets better as it progresses, though by then its too late to save the overall interpretation.

A hint of interpretation does come into the play in the scene in the countryside when Kate and Petruchio meet Vincentio; Kate starts to take Petruchios behaviour as a sort of game, and decides shes going to play along. As an interpretation of the play and of her transformation, though, this strikes me as a weak one.

The party scene at the end is well done, but Kates big speech appears just to be spoken into the air, bizarrely. Again, its as though they didn't know what to make of it; it seems a fitting conclusion for the performance as a whole.",1432166400,,2674,4.609243697478991

I was a little skeptical at first because I did not think I would enjoy it. It left room for imagination. When they get to his place, though, It was hard to imagine that part. It looked like a one room shack. But over all I liked it. The acting was great. John Cleese was a superb actor in this and quite handsome!!",1424217600,,445,4.01123595505618

I was pleased to rent it here for 7 days to take in a little each day, but a 28 day rental for the same price would be more beneficial to use weekly on community days. It is performed on a non-elaborate set. Sometimes the words get lost in the acting. I couldn't figure out how to get the subtitles on the screen. I think that would be helpful to keep up with the Elizabethean wording and speech. I will recommend this to others.",1412812800,2,585,4.4672897196261685

His choices of a sensitive, intelligent, non-sexist Petruchio are perfect for our 21st century world without losing any Elizabethan credibility.

3850584,3,B00262JIKS,"I was disappointed in this production. My main problem was that you don't like Kate. John Cleese does a great job for having never done Shakespeare before. He is likable and seems to have a real connection with Kate. You can tell he likes her from the start.
I wish they had more chemistry. Otherwise what is the point of the play. I found Kate to be just one note and missing the nuances that make her interesting and likable. I also found the secondary characters to be trying too hard.

So thumbs up for John Cleese! But the rest just missed.",1400457600,,545,4.3431372549019605
3850585,3,B00262JIKS,"I admit that ""The Taming of the Shrew"" is my favorite guilty pleasure Shakespeare play.  It's so sexist, even abusive, by today's standards.  But the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton movie is one of my favorite movies, and the battle between the headstrong Kate and the overbearing Petruchio is deliciously gratifying.

That being said, I adore John Cleese, a Monty Python alum who was just magnificent in ""A Fish Called Wanda.""  I have always found him sexy, and I thought I would love him in this role.  But no, something is just off in this undertaking of ""Shrew.""  Cleese comes across as mean and callous, not as a man who is secretly in love with Katherine (as I always want to believe.)  Perhaps the casting of Katherine undermined the production.  The actress who plays her has the acting chops, but is not particularly pretty or sexy.

Anyway, this production did not gel for me, and with deepest regret, I cannot recommend it.",1388966400,3,934,4.7875
3850586,2,B00262JIKS,"I had high hopes for this video when I read the reviews. I found that it wasn't funny. The lines and roles were delivered too seriously, and lines that should have sparked laughter fell flat. I didn't understand why Kate kept screaming at random moments: just to prove her shrewishness? I was unsatisfying for me.",1388534400,,313,4.709090909090909
3850587,5,B00262JIKS,"This is a fantastically fun version of The Taming of the Shrew. Cleese's convivial insight into Shakespeare brings his specific brand of droll comic genius into full splendor here. However, it is the moments of warmth and love Cleese shows toward Kate that bring this production into a full and satisfying viewing experience, rather than just a fun romp.

Every version has it's pros and cons. As with any BBC production, the production values are low - and for many modern viewers, that is a deal breaker. But if you have patience and imagination enough to overcome this limitation, you will be amply compensated by the acting and direction.

Everyone has their favorite film versions of each play and while I'm rather fond of this version and Cleese's warm and heart-felt interpretation of Petruchio, it's great to see them all and compare different interpretations. I'd encourage you to check out William Ball's 1976 ACT version:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Taming-of-the-Shrew/dp/B00021Y850/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Taming of the Shrew</a>&nbsp;staring . . . Marc Singer. Okay I know that sounds crazy, since he was Beastmaster, but seriously, it's a fabulous production in the Italian commedia dell'arte style and a contrast of the two shows how remarkably versatile this play is.

3850590,5,B00262JIKS,"Shakespeare must have had a special love for fools and rogues, since we wrote such good parts for them, and this play has the classic rogue, played by an actor with a genius for comedy. John Cleese single handedly makes this an outstanding performance of the play. It may still not be the very best, as the supporting cast is competent, but not sterling. Cleese outdoes Richard Burton's performance, but Elizabeth Taylor gives more energy to the part than what we see in this film.

Part of the success may be due to the director, Jonathan Miller, whose skill in comedy is as strong as that of Cleese. There is something about the premise of the play which seems to demand that the director and the players go a bit ""beyond the fringe"" as it were. I saw on Television a long time ago a production done in the style of the Italian Comedia del arte, which was popular in Shakespeare's day. It demonstrated how the initial dialogue between Kate and Petruchio was crackling with an intensity which was not in, for example, the clever dialogue between Benedick and Beatrice in ""Much Ado About Nothing.""

Still, Cleese' performance is worth the price of admission.",1374019200,9,1158,4.671568627450981

3850595,5,B00262JIKS,"Yeah, Joan is hard to beat, but look at the mechanics - Cleese is a comedian and the remaining actors are just as unlikely. You have to understand what BBC was presented with when they looked at this interpretation. It flies in the face of what Americans (yes, me) think of as classic British. But the comedy and sarcasm and confusion is exactly Cleese's home turf. And it's not about Cleese, at least he doesn't make it about himself. Imagine all those stars trying to own Shakespeare. What would Will say? How do we honor his intent. If you take this stuff seriously, you'll love this version. My wife is a Musical Theater BFA and a Shakespeare buff (It sucks playing trivia games with her when Shakespeare comes up) and instead of hearing ""Pffft"" and ""What ?!??!"" and ""Uhh."", I heard exclamations that made me consider giving up joke telling.
