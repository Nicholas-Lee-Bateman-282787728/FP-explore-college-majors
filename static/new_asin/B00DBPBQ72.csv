5787555,1,B00DBPBQ72,"I LOVED the animation. It's the 1st time I ever seen animation like it & I think it looked pretty cool. OK, That's the best & only good thing I can say about the movie. Other than that, Top Cat SUCKED!!! I tried watching the entire movie (Probably because I enjoyed the animation so much) but I just could NOT do it. Top Cat is a movie I don't think kids would even be able to sit through. The storyline & jokes were just straight up BORING, CORNY & LAME..I enjoyed the original Top Cat cartoons so I was hoping to enjoy this movie but I didn't at all. It might be worth watching for a couple minutes just to check out the animation but that's about it",1423785600,2,652,4.1015625

5787559,2,B00DBPBQ72,"This might be the WORST Animated movie ever made! (and I have seen FOOD FIGHT!) Maybe not the most unpleasant, (which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one) but I DO NOT recommend this one to fans of animation, or even fans of the show!

The only positive thing I can say, is that they at least had the decency to offer a download of the movie for FREE with purchase of the DVD. But other than that, this one is a DEFINITE SKIP!",1404086400,4,436,4.011494252873563
5787560,4,B00DBPBQ72,"Because after seeing the trailers on youtube, I was waiting for the movie to come to the United States. When I saw that you had it on dvd I decided to order it.",1394928000,,160,3.878787878787879

5787562,5,B00DBPBQ72,"For starter, my 9 year son saw a preview of this movie and he told me about it. So I decided to purchase it, since couldn't find it at the store.",1388620800,2,145,3.7096774193548385
5787563,5,B00DBPBQ72,"Yeah this is not a masterpiece by any means, but it does what it is supposed to do: put T.C. and his friends in a modern day adventure. It's effectual and purr-fect in every which way. Highly Recommended!",1385683200,6,204,4.394736842105263
8591429,3,B00DBPBQ72,I haven't really watched it however my one year old doesn't seem to like it like he does his other cartoons so i will watch it and tell u later what I think,1484611200,,156,3.757575757575758

8591436,5,B00DBPBQ72,I was pleasantly surprised by my sons interest in this movie. It's usually his choice to watch before dozens of others he has. He tells everyone how great this movie is to him and even takes it along when we go places. It's not only one character but  all of them he likes.,1433808000,2,273,4.150943396226415
