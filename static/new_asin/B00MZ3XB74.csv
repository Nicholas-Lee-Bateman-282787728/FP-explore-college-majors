8675443,4,B00MZ3XB74,"3 1/2 STARS --- REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND POSSIBLY AGE GROUP --- THOSE EXPECTING SOMETHING DARKER OR SCARIER MAY BE DISSAPOINTED

WARNING: THIS DOES NOT HAVE ENGLISH DUB AS NOTED BY AMAZON PREVIOUSLY

Given the origin of this anime, many have expected something darker or harder like it's predecessors. I had no expectations coming in and enjoyed it. However, I still had some observations that may help others make their choice if it's for them. This unique Japanese take on the more European ""wolf tale"" (with a hint of vampire), is still very nicely done. It is still a pretty dark and macabre tale (there is bloodshed), but has a very light feel when the bad things aren't happening. The characters are interesting, but not as complex or overtly evil compared to the hard core horror animes. I would even suggest it's maybe targeted at those old enough for a little horror and death themes, but maybe not for the really heavy stuff. That and adults who like a little darkness in their story, but not the heavy stuff. The high school characters also often sound much younger, though that's not that unusual.

THE PLOT (no spoilers): Hiroshi is a student who has just moved to Jouga city with his father and sister. His father writes novels involving myth and has come to Jouga specifically for it's rich local mythology of the Jouga wolf. Jouga is heavily isolated by mountains and deep forest on all sides. It is said that wolves the size of humans once roamed the area anciently. Hiroshi was not particularly popular before, but finds other kids at school are quite friendly and are very taken with him. In fact, his neighbor Isuzu laches onto him and immediately treats him like a boyfriend. Her older brother also has a very weird obsession with him. All are friendly save the standoffish class president Nemuru. She tells him his presence is problematic. Hiroshi has arrived just before the local Hassaku orange festival where the residence celebrate their very special type of orange. This includes writing wishes on paper and wrapping them on the oranges in a festive way, eventually rolling them down the steps at the local temple. As Hiroshi explores his new home, Isuzu warns him to stay clear of the old city. You see, Jouga is divided into the old part with classical Japanese architecture, and the new part on the other side of the river. People from the old city don't like to mix and are scornful of those in the new. As the matsuri (festival) grows close, strange things are happening and students are disappearing from class one by one. Hiroshi witnesses a scene of horror one night as a person is hunted in the dark alleys by a swarm of red glowing eyes. A female with white hair and a scythe appears like the grim reaper and strikes the person down. This is all near the beginning and from there it's a process of discovering what is going on and the meaning of the myths. Of course the matsuri date looms ominously as some great event is supposed to take place. Why is everyone so taken with Hiroshi? What is behind the murders? Who is the white haired girl? It will all be woven together in a decent little tale by the end.

FINAL THOUGHTS: The mythology of the Jouga wolf was pretty nice, though not necessarily complex. At the end of each episode there is a stanza of the ""numbers song"" that is chanted to preview the next episode and what happens. It was a nice touch with some very traditional Japanese style. The characters are interesting, but once you step away from the main characters, some of the supporting ones can be a little two dimensional. But again, this is only a problem depending on your expectations. When steered to the right audience, this anime has been very popular. It has disappointed others. For me personally, it was not among my most favorites so I suggest a rental before you buy.",1422662400,,3849,4.647577092511013
