8360402,5,B002AUIFAU,"The DVD was shipped in perfect condition, and the shipping was FAST! I also like the two short workouts on the DVD, with one focusing on the upper body, and the second focusing on the lower body and the abdominals so you can alternate, using one workout a day. Each workout is about 15 minutes long, and Joyce and her daughter make a really fun team to do the workouts with. There are also two short sections on the DVD focusing on alternative exercise positions for difficult exercises.

Because these workouts are slow-moving, they allow me to use heavier weights if I want to in order to work on strength training. That is specifically why I bought this DVD, so I can use heavier weights. But these workouts also provide a great workout using lighter weights too. For more of a challenge, you can also do the upper body workout twice over in one day, and the lower body workout two times through on the next day. Or, if you want to get a full body workout, you can do both workout sections back to back on one day.",1459987200,4,1017,4.380952380952381
8360403,4,B002AUIFAU,"This is one of 2 Joyce Vedral DVDs that I have kept.  For some reason, I really like her ""different"" workouts, not her usual strength training.  I like this DVD because it's a different take on strength training. You go very slow, 4 counts on the up move, and 4 back down to complete one rep of an exercise.  Then, you switch to the next exercise with 4 counts on the up move, and 4 back down.  Together, those two moves are a combination of two moves and you then repeat the combination 10 times. Then you do the next exercise combination until you have finished.

Because the workout is intense, you need do only one set per exercise: time under tension is apparently the key. This is an excellent workout to contrast to the faster moving ones because it gives your body the variety it needs to get passed sticking points or plateaus. I think that it's tougher than it looks. They say you need one set of light dumbbells, but I use a couple.  I start off with a heavier light weight and switch to a liglhter light weight for smaller muscles like the shoulders.  Right now, I'm using 5 pounds for heavy and 3 pounds for lighter.  Before my really bad fitness year last year, I was up to 8 and 5 pounds and now I'm coming back.

The first duet is tricep kickbacks and shoulder side lifts. The 2nd duet is a French press and overhead shoulder press. The 3rd is chest press with bicep curls using the bench (sometimes, I use my Reebok step.) The 4th is pec flies and hammer curls done the same way. According to the DVD menu, this is the upper body section and you can stop here or go on to lower-body section. The lower body is done starting with squats done at the same time doing a back lat pinch type exercise. The second is a hack squat but then you alternate again with a rear lateral lift. (Every time I do the workout, I wonder how the back came to be classified as lower body.)  Next it is on the floor alternating curls and an exercise that is similar to Joyce's frog leg lifts. The next combination on the floor is similar. Then you do bridge pose holding for a count of 30 and you are done.

I really like this workout and do it for the upper body workout.  It's close to worthless for lower body, but I do that section because it includes the back - an upper-body body part.  Although I really like this workout , I just am not going to fool myself that it's really a total body workout. It's upper and abs, that just happens to touch on lower body a tad.  But, I figure it will balance out those total-body workouts I have that emphasize the lower body much more than the upper.",1430092800,8,2590,4.237804878048781

8360405,5,B002AUIFAU,"It is good how Joyce uses the weights slower in this dvd to ""mix it up"".  It is different for your body, so muscle confusion is good.  There are many Joyce dvds to choose from and although others are longer and more traditional Joyce Vedral workouts, this one still is good for a different or light day.  Very happy with my purchase.",1401148800,5,333,4.338709677419355

8360407,5,B002AUIFAU,"This is tougher than it looks! I used 5 lb.s and got a good workout, but Joyce says she uses 8 at home. You go very slow, 4 counts on the up move, and 4 back to starting doing 1 rep of an exercise then switch to the next exercise doing 1 rep, then repeat 10 times. The first duet is tricep kickbacks and shoulder side lifts. The 2nd duet is a French press and overhead shoulder press. The 3rd is chest press with bicep curls using the bench also. The 4th is pec flies and hammer curls done the same way. You can stop here or go onto lower body. The lower body is done starting with squats done at the same time doing a back lat pinch type exercise. The second is a hack squat but then you alternate again with a rear lateral lift. Next it is on the floor alternating curls and an exercise that is similar to Joyce's frog leg lifts. The next on the floor is similar. Then you do bridge pose holding for a count of 30 and you are done. The alternate exercises are variations you can do to add in extra reps since they do a full 10. I was very impressed and also sore.",1344816000,11,1065,3.9813084112149535
8360408,2,B002AUIFAU,"Expected her usual great DVD's but this one is way too short.  The idea for slow workout with weights is good, just not enough of a good thing.",1298851200,3,143,4.107142857142857
