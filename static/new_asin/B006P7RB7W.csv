8502659,3,B006P7RB7W,"The first 80-percent of this movie is a boring stereotype. Professor falls in love with bimbo. Has other affairs. Is estranged from needy son. Then the bimbo leaves him because he's a cad. But in the last 20-percent of the movie, the bimbo comes back. A real person, in distress, needing him. At this point the quality of the movie soars. Cruz is stunning in her acting. A problem remains, however: I just couldn't believe that the professor, visiting her in the hospital, would now show loyalty to her as the director wanted us to believe. He's still the cad he always was. Regarding the performances of his best friend who got accolades from the press? No; very tepid, almost like an ""extra."" His blonde mistress? Not stellar as the critics said, but very good. The movie is worth watching to experience Cruz at the end. It's too bad you can't skip the rest to make sense of the end.",1506384000,,885,4.5375
