7905699,5,B000009RZO,"A lot of bad ""Bruce Lee"" movies have been made in the years after the legend's death, and Bruce Le starred in his share of them, but Bruce Le's Greatest Revenge is, to my way of thinking, excellent; it's almost as good as one of Bruce Lee's films.  Le is certainly no Bruce Lee, but he has some of the vintage look, style, posturing, and moves, and in this movie in particular he has something special that is all his own that comes through loud and clear from all the many fight scenes.  I know some fans of martial arts movies disagree with my positive appraisal of this film, and some even call the fight scenes boring.  This almost boggles my mind because the fight scenes I watched and enjoyed were intense, lengthy, and impressive indeed.  Of course, I know nothing about the form and theory of martial arts; I only know what I like, and I like the martial arts on display here.
Bruce Le's Greatest Revenge is in many respects a remake of Bruce Lee's The Chinese Connection (released as Fist of Fury in Europe).  The setting is a China occupied and harassed by the Japanese; I'm sure this film is not a big seller in Japan because the Japanese characters in this film are merciless, greedy monsters.  Bruce Le plays a student at a martial arts school, whose Teacher refuses to help budding Chinese revolutionaries learn kung fu in preparation for resisting the Japanese.  Bruce, though, is not one to back down from a challenge, court cries of cowardice, or sit idly by while Chinese women are abused.  His tendency to beat up a lot of the Japanese men and fighters he meets gets the Japanese hopping mad, brings the Chinese police force into the mix, and eventually sets the stage for your typical Bruce against the whole world ending.  The Japanese have a couple of secret weapons on their side, if you can call them that: a European who thinks this is all supposed to be about fencing and a fairly large Mongolian stud.  Are these a match for our hero?  What do you think?
The martial arts school serves as the setting of one large-scale melee involving just about everyone except Bruce Le.  My novice eye was quite impressed by the length and fight choreography of this major skirmish, taking particular delight in watching Teacher's daughter give the men what for.  Basically, the final half hour of this film consists of fight scenes; the venue changes as Bruce makes his way past all of Mr. Big's henchmen, but it is nonstop action that had me enthralled.  Bruce Le's Greatest Revenge is by far the best and most exciting non-Bruce Lee martial arts film I have seen.",1065484800,5,2579,4.566160520607375
7905700,4,B000009RZO,"I saw this movie back in the mid-80s and it was my first martial arts flick. Bruce Le, while no match for the master himself Bruce Lee, does an adequate job as the hero.
Much of the plot contains elements from Lee's second film ""Fists of Fury (Chinese Connection)."" Examples include the Japanese harassment of a Chinese kung fu school, the token white guy with the saber and the sign ""no Chinese"" in the Japanese area.
The used VHS I ordered had terrible video quality (the horrendous audio that dubbed HK action flicks have is already a given) and I'm contemplating whether to buy another copy. Plus, you miss so much of the action as the film is presented in standard format. So don't expect viewing enjoyment from the technical side.
That side, this is still a keeper for me.",1018828800,2,778,4.564285714285714
