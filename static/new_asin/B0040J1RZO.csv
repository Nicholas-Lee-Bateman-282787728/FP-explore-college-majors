4240450,5,B0040J1RZO,"Inside one of the nations toughest and most dangerous prisons, Donaldson Correction Facility, lies the heart of the Buddha.

Dhamma Brothers is an absolutely amazing documentary that follows dharma teachers Bruce Stewart and Jonathan Crowley as they lead a 10 day Vipassana retreat with 36 prisoners. Bruce and Jonathan ""camp out"" at the prison the whole time during the retreat.

Regardless of the wrongs these men committed they were all on the same playing field during the retreat. There were no murderers, no rapists, no burglars, just 36 men trying there best to truly change the way the live their lives, knowing full well they may never see beyond the prison walls.

The transformation the prisoners go through is awe-inspiring, proving that something is truly lacking in our prison systems. Rather than numbering and cataloging the men and women in our prison systems, given the option to truly change I believe most of them would choose that. Instead of going off on a tirade about that, let's keep to Dhamma Brothers.

After the Vipissana project really seems to gather some steam in Donaldson, it is shut down almost as quickly as it came. It seems other chaplains, from other religious backgrounds, in Donaldson were complaining that their ""congregations"" were lacking behind, and more people seemed to be turning onto the Vipissana. So, being a prison in Alabama, an area mostly inhabited by Christians who don't understand or care to understand anything other than their own religious background, the Vipissana group was extinguished.

Luckily, the administration changed some time after and the program was restored. We see some of the same men from the original retreat show up, years later and still practicing, ready and willing to take on another 10 day retreat.

The Dhamma Brothers has received many awards, as it fully deserves. It is more than worth your time to seek this film out. I went through various emotional changes while watching this, but it all began and ended with happiness. Dhamma Brothers give the viewer faith in humanity, that we all really do have Buddha-nature, regardless of the mistakes we have made. We wouldn't be human if we didn't make mistakes, unfortunately some of us make larger one than others, but who is the one to judge that?

I congratulate the teachers and the film makers for taking on such a significant task, you are all truly inspiring, please keep up the great work.",1286150400,20,2430,4.970443349753695
4240451,4,B0040J1RZO,"I enjoyed this documentary; but, I must say I was a little disappointed in the detail that was missing, that I had read in the book.  The book explained a lot more and had a lot more to offer as far as letters from the prisoners and more detail into their constant battle to keep the Vipassana program(s) going within the prisons.
But, it was still an amazing documentary to watch and actually put faces to the names, from those in the book.  Just remember, it is a Meditation Documentary, it is not an action packed, prison-life film.  It is a documentary focusing on those who attended the very first ever Vipassana Program, in US Prisons.  It does give their stories on where they started and how they came to be where they are today.",1408060800,2,737,4.437037037037037
4240452,5,B0040J1RZO,"This documentary takes us through the experience of a group of inmates in a maximum security prison
in Alabama who elected to go through a 10 day course of vipassana meditation.

We are introduced to many of the prisoners as well as those who run the prison and the teachers of the course. They are all quite candid about what is going on. Many said that they had low expectations.

The course gives the students the opportunity to go inside and experience things which, in many cases, they had denied for many years. For most this was a very painful experience and they let us know how hard it was.

It also was a transformative experience as we learn.

Following the course many students and the prison staff observe men who have dramatically changed for the better.

The style of vipassana taught was that of Goenka which involves sweeping via the body to observe physical sensations.

Many of the inmates continued to meditate as a group, by their own choice, daily for some time after the course ended. They said that this greatly improved their lives.

This meditation group was shut down by the Alabama Department of Corrections after local people, led by the Christian chaplains, complained that the inmates were now becoming Buddhists and that this was a threat to Christianity.

Subsequently, after many changes, the two teachers were invited back to offer the course another time.

We do not know, from the film, whether these men are permitted to meditate any longer as a group.

A fine film which I find really inspiring.

Also, take an hour and go to youtube and watch the award-winning Israeli documentary, Doing time, Doing vipassana. Shows how the director of all prisons in India did this. Now it's available at every prison in India thanks to her pioneering efforts.

4240454,5,B0040J1RZO,"This film documents what happened when a ten-day course teaching an ancient meditation technique was brought into Alabama's toughest prison. Prior to its introduction at the level 6 maximum security W.E. Donald Correctional Facility in Bessemer, AL, the ten-day Vipassana Meditation course had been introduced into the 10,000 inmate Tihar Jail in New Delhi, India with good results.  It has since been offered in other prisons around the world.  The volunteer-run, ten-day program, which is cost-free but does require cooperation from prison authorities, has been shown to reduce recidivism; since this film was made, studies have been initiated to document this.

Dhamma Brothers holds one's attention to the end. It is uplifting to learn about a powerful and relatively inexpensive course that can help prisoners permanently change for the better their way of looking at and experiencing life.  Several years after producing this documentary film, Jenny Phillips published letters written to her and the other Dhamma volunteers since then by Donald Correctional Facility inmates who took the 10-day Vipassana course ( Dhamma Brothers: Meditation Behind Bars). This allows us to see that the work begun in Dhamma Brothers has born great fruit and further illuminates the powerful potential of this meditation method for changing the lives of prisoners.",1397001600,3,1353,5.490384615384615

4240460,5,B0040J1RZO,"The Dhamma Brothers is a documentary that exposes the powerful effects of meditation. Dharma instructors Bruce Stewart and Jonathan Crowley lead a ten-day Vipassana retreat for 36 prisoners at the Donaldson Correctional Facility in Alabama. The prison has a gritty reputation, and the documentary thoughtfully portrays the daily violence and hostility going into the retreat. The prisoners are convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to homicide, and the directors' inclusion of media coverage of the crimes and interviews with the prisoners and their families provide background knowledge on some prisoners yet also aids a connection between the viewer and inmates. The retreat exposes the humanity of the convicts through self-reflection and acceptance of past mistakes, on the journey for inner peace. The transformations that occur are inspiring and unifying, and break down the rigid division between `good' and `evil' people.

Dhamma Brothers also briefly explores tolerance in Alabama, as the program is shut down due to town complaints that the retreats are a non-Christian practice. When the spiritual retreat eventually returns to the prison, viewers recognize faces from the original retreat and welcome newcomers, cheering for their silent search for resolution. Dhamma Brothers is a great documentary with a clear message, whilst remaining highly entertaining.

4240476,4,B0040J1RZO,"I've heard of vipassana and would like to learn how to do it. This film shows dramatic evidence that it works. From what I understand, it's rare that any prison or counseling program effects real change in inmates (or in those on the outside, either). How many people do you know who truly change?

So, an amazing film.

However, I thought this film would have been much better if it had explained, even if just the basics, of what vipassana is and how it changes people. They talked alot about vipassana, and showed people doing it (sitting) - but what is it? You watch these amazing results but have no idea what caused it.

I have to assume this film is for people who are already vipassana practicers. But it leaves the other 99.99% of us in the dark.

(If anyone can point me to a video or audio course teaching how to do this, please tell me in the comments section of this review.)

In short, an amazing film. But also maddening to the uninitiated.",1352937600,2,955,4.403409090909091

There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you. . . . The fears that my parents had had for me, and that I had had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew. . . . Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies. The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. . . . Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone's total control, and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes. . . .

4240481,5,B0040J1RZO,"A number of films have been made by now on the use of Vipassana meditation in correctional facilities or prisons.  Those still available include: ""Doing Time, Doing Vipassana"" and ""Changing From Inside"".

""Doing Time, Doing Vipassana"" describes the introduction of Vipassana meditation as taught by Satyanarayan Goenka (S N Goenka, often addressed as simply ""Goenkaji"") into the prison system of India.  At the time of this highly significant event in world prison history Kiran Bedi, infamous as a champion of anti-corruption drives within the Indian police system, was in charge at the maximum security prison in Delhi, Tihar Jail.  ""Doing Time, Doing Vipassana""  describes how Bedi became aware of the power of Vipassana meditation in this tradition to effect profound and enduring change in people.  She was interested in helping criminals out of criminality and had a vision that it was possible.  Vipassana meditation came to her attention as the tool to carve this change.  Although Vipassana had been employed in Indian prisons before, notably in Baroda in Gujarat, the first course at Tihar Jail was attended by no fewer than 1000 high security inmates. Goenkaji himself conducted this 10-day course.  The true story-line has a certain drama to it.  Tihar jail now has a permanent Vipassana meditation centre and Vipassana meditation in this tradition has been recommended throughout the prison system of India.  Psychological studies have been completed in India which catalogue the positive psychological effects of Vipassana for prison inmates.

""Changing From Inside"" documents the before and after of a course of Vipassana meditation, as taught by Goenkaji, at a correctional facility in Seattle in the USA.  This film more closely documents  the administrative questioning, reservations and concerns that preceded the course itself. A requirement of these courses when held in prisons or correctional facilities is that at least 2 of the correctional facility staff should themselves have completed a 10-day course of Vipassana meditation as taught by Goenkaji.  A beautiful moment in this film is when one of the administrators recalls her first Vipassana meditation course; she is visibly moved by the memory, demonstrating the depth the technique had reached for her.

The before and after for the inmates of the correctional facility, another significant and informative feature of ""Changing From Inside"",  is even more dramatic.  Issues and reservations which inmates had had prior to the course,  had cartwheeled round 180 degrees by after the course into deeply moved personal transformation and positivity.  The same was true also for the staff; where other therapies and techniques had been all very well, it was Vipassana meditation that had produced real change that had stuck.

These two films were made on something of a budget and specifically for the fraternity and sorority of Vipassana meditators in this tradition.  They are very worthwhile viewing on the subject.

""The Dhamma Brothers"", again set within a US correctional facility, this time for very serious offenders, mainly homicides, is a dramatic shift in gear from the previous two in a couple of respects:

Firstly, the depth of presentation of the inmates, their crimes, their lives, their personal feelings and ultimately the ravishingly profound and lasting personal katharsis and change which they experienced far exceeds that of ""Doing Time, Doing Vipassana""  and ""Changing from Inside"".  Again the concerns of administration are a major point of focus.  In ""The Dhamma Brothers"" this focus becomes itself an unexpected twist  which moulds it into a dramatic story line, all the more theatrical because it is for real.

Secondly, the project was conceived in much greater depth than was possible with the limited budgets of the prevous two films.  It took 10 years to come into being; 10 years of earnest work, aspirations at times raised and at times thwarted, resolving finally in some moments of sheer personal poetry.  This leaves the viewer with a sense of gratitude to the convicted individuals for opening their inner experiences, their journey from the hideous towards the sublime, to others.  ""The Dhamma Brothers"" is a fully professional movie in its own right, in addition to the impact it necessarily has as a real story.

The pricing reflects not only the budget of the film's production but also the niche market to which it has to address itself by default.  For anyone who cares about the condition of society, who is concerned about human healing and transformation made palpably possible in a world that at times appears mechanised out of humanity, who has an interest in the power of the individual to transform their own self and mind through deep meditation, for anyone interested in just being moved by a great and human story of the triumph of the good in people, ""The Dhamma Brothers"" is a film that will express, inspire and move.  In this sense it is actually priceless.

It ought to be added at least as an afternote, though it deserves to be a forenote, that the technique which we see being taught, learned and put into practice in these films is a technique with a distinctive difference.  It jumps out clear from the hoop of all three films that Vipassana meditation technique and the way it is taught in this tradition were the sine qua non for producing the results we see in ""The Dhamma Brothers"" and the other two films.  Should there be any doubt on this point it is only necessary to hear what the inmates of the prisons have to say about it themselves when all else they had tried had failed to dredge the latent depths they wanted to clear.",1306195200,19,5676,5.08963282937365

There's no loud soundtrack, no shocking images--though there is some background on the crimes some of the inmates committed and how they feel about their actions, as well as a few locals and their preconceived notions about meditation. There are no bleeding-heart pleas for clemency--not from the meditation teacher, not from the prisoners' relatives, and not from the prisoners themselves.

8412368,5,B0040J1RZO,"Dhamma Brothers films the 2002 ten-day Vipassana meditation retreat carried on in Alabama at one of the most violent prisons in America.  Any of you who have participated in a S.N. Goenka retreat realize that its rigid structure of absolute silence and ten hours a day of sitting meditation is challenging, to put it mildly.  It was my first retreat, and I have held it as meditation boot camp.  One of the 36 prisoners in the group commented that it was tougher than his eight years on death row.  Initial skepticism about offering the retreat is replaced by amazement at the positive results.  Months afterward, tough lifers were still practicing meditation and striving to live by its precepts, and prison violence had de-escalated.  Unfortunately, this uniquely successful therapy was abruptly terminated because of pressure applied by Christians.  But the film offers a constructive alternative to the hopelessness of human warehousing.",1414972800,,941,5.233333333333333
