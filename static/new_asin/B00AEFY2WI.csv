5410497,5,B00AEFY2WI,"If you ask me, this should have been the template for the series. At least for all additional sequels and reboots.  For the first time, a FRIDAY film is infused with camp.  This is not a comedy, but there are certainly comedic moments.  The writer and director clearly knew the material, and that they were dealing with a ""part 6"" of a critically reviled series.  With Part V, the series had clearly hit a low mark with fans as well.  They needed to charge life back in to Jason.  And they did.  From the opening resurrection, this movie is FUN.  Its got thrills, laughs, and Jason's signature kills.  It is never dull, or takes itself seriously.

Purchased this again after not seeing it in many years.  It still is a very entertaining movie in its own right, and if you grew up on Friday the 13th, I still think it stands as the hallmark of the series.  I believe any future reboots and remakes would be wise to borrow the tone from JASON LIVES.",1403654400,5,947,4.379310344827586

5410499,5,B00AEFY2WI,"This is one of the best and one of my favorite Friday the 13th movies. It's different, it's funny, has a car chase, Gothic and a tribute to 40's/50's classic horror films. It's not just horny teenagers in an abandoned house and Jason happens to show up and kill them which about 4 sequels are. Tommy Jarvis wants to make sure Jason is dead. (Pretend Part V never happened!) Him and a friend go to the cemetery to make sure, but Tommy accidentally brings Jason back to life. This is the one where Jason becomes more of a zombie and walks, instead of running. Tommy gets thrown in jail, and the Sheriff's daughter, Megan begins to have a crush on Tommy. Camp Crystal Lake has been renamed to Forrest Green because no one wants to remember about Jason. Later, Megan helps Tommy break out of jail so he can go to Crystal Lake and stop Jason once and for all!!! I highly recommend Friday THE 13TH PART VI: JASON LIVES!!!",1390262400,3,915,4.3882352941176475

5410503,5,B00AEFY2WI,"It's just my opinion, but I believe this is the best film out of all 12 Friday the 13th movies. A few run a close second like the 2009 remake, the 1980 original, part 2 and part 4. The reason I admire this one so much is because of the mix of humor with horror. Also the subtle nods to the classic horror films are genius (Karloff's General Store and the fact Jason is revived by lightning just like Frankenstein's Monster)! Thom Mathews is perfect as Tommy Jarvis and C.J. Graham is awesome as Jason! The music soundtrack by Alice Cooper gives it that extra uniqueness! I have no quarrels with the Deluxe Edition DVD I purchased. The transfer is 100% A-OK! The extras are great as well. I recommend this movie to all fans of the genre and especially Jason fans!",1376697600,10,762,4.373239436619718

You would think people would no better not to mess with things they don't understand or can deal with. This movie proves once again how people simply don't learn from the past mistakes of others and keep the body count on the raise.",1444608000,,517,4.329896907216495
5410519,5,B00AEFY2WI,"The fairly detailed plot:  After all the madness and trauma that Tommy Jarvis has faced he's totally committed to making sure that Jason Voorhees not only can never come back, but hopefully ensure his passage to hell.  Tommy returns to Crystal Lake.  Only now its name is Forest Green.  It's name was changed so that everyone can forget about Jason's slayings and try to move on and live normal lives.  Tommy and some guy named Allen Hawes drive during a windy, stormy, cloudy, and foggy night to the cemetery that Jason has been buried in, while Tommy is in possession of Jason's hockey mask.  When arriving they dig him up and Tommy grabs a metal fence stake.  Tommy then stabs Jason's corpse and lightning strikes the stake which brings Jason back to life like Frankenstein.  Tommy struggles with Jason and grabs a gas can throws gas on Jason, but just as Tommy grabs a match some rain falls and puts the match out.  Hawes then tries to strike Jason with a shovel and Jason kills Hawes.  Tommy takes off and while Jason dons his hockey mask once again.  As Jason is holding the metal stake, the camera pans through Jason's right eye and through his eye you see the opening credits image.  It shows a James Bond like opening image showing Jason slashing at the screen with blood spurting spelling out the subtitle ""Jason Lives"" and Friday the 13th is below it.  Tommy tries to tell Sheriff Garris but he won't listen to Tommy and to make matters worse he locks Tommy up.  We next get introduced to Darren(Tony Goldwyn) and Lizabeth who are trying to find their way to the Forest Green(formerly Crystal Lake) campgrounds and meet with other camp counselors to soon start working.  Unfortunately, they soon run into Jason.  Darren tries shooting Jason with no luck and Jason kills Darren with the metal stake.  Lizabeth attempts to bribe Jason and Jason kills her with the stake also.  Now we meet the newest camp counselors, Cort a goofy pretty boy, Sissy a beautiful African American girl, Paula a gorgeous ginger girl, and last but not least Sheriff Garris super gorgeous daughter, Megan.  The new camp counselors arrive at camp with the supplies and a bus arrives delivering the children to the camp.  Plenty of mayhem is likely to occur with Jason on the loose with all this coming into play.

The musical score is still composed by Harry Manfredini.  This time he puts added terror, mystery, and tension into the score.

Martin Becker returns to do the gore but this time he does a far better job at making them more realistic looking than he did in part 5.  The kill scenes also prove to be much more creative and progressively unique and they truly upped the game in that way.  Unfortunately some of the kills are off camera.

The Director and the writer this time is Tom McLoughlin.  The script is amazingly well written in terms of the humor and self-awareness in its breaking the fourth wall, but also the characters are very interesting.  I particularly enjoyed the characters of Tommy and Megan and there incredible chemistry and relating to eachother.  It's too bad they don't end up falling in love though.

Sadly there's neither any of the beauties and hotties in bikinis nor is there any nudity this time.  That doesn't ruin the movie at all though.

The dark night scenes including fog, heavy winds, thunder, lightning, and rain all added well to the creepy atmosphere and the feeling of unease and suspense.

This chapter carries some humor and campy elements with it.  Two of the boy campers make sarcastic remarks at times, Cort is one zany goofball, the paintball playing business people are all pretty funny as well.  Without going into too much those are some general ideas of the humor and camp.

Jason's weapons of choice this time are:  a machete, a glass bottle, a Bowie knife, a metal stake, and his bare hands.

My favorite kill scenes are Jason shoving Nikki's face through the Rv bathroom wall, the triple decapitation that he did with a machete on the paintball playing business people, and when Jason shoves a sharp object through a loving couple both at once.

Overall, this movie is my second most favorite.  My first being part 3.  This one carries some great sentimental value with it from when I saw it as a teenager.  With its humor, cool kill scenes, gore, well written script, believable and interesting characters, great soundtrack and score both, excellent pace, beautiful women,  the dreary and forboding weather conditions and dark nights, and best of all it proved to be a vast improvement over part 5 on countless levels.",1443916800,3,4569,4.715909090909091

5410521,4,B00AEFY2WI,"Friday the 13th has always been something of a mixed bag when we look at the entire series. Surprisingly when it looked like the series might have run out of ideas after part V, the studio wisely embraced the return of Jason, but did so with a wink of the eye and a nod to Frankenstein which set the tone for most films after this one. But what this film did best is not over think the concept. Audiences were hungry to see Jason do his thing and so he did. The entire movie is essentially one long chase with just a minimal of set up and then off we go.

But what I enjoy best is there is no nudity and the gore is considerably toned done. So if you have middle school kids who enjoy the horror flicks of this kind, you can leave the room without worrying about an inappropriate scene (like the internet doesn't already supply enough). By today's standards this is EASILY a PG-13 at worst. So the director keeps Jason in the spotlight for most of the film, but doesn't try to over indulge in the killings to make them grotesque so much as fantastically unreal which keeps the film in a surreal environment you wouldn't associate with real life. It's a classic 80's horror film playing to all the right notes and even has Alice Cooper supplying much of the soundtrack tunes.

If you're looking for a fun night of thrills and chills from the horror genre, this is a fun installment to plug in. Chances are good you'll enjoy the experience leaving you hungry for more. Sadly the series really fell off the cliff after this entry. So in many ways, this is the last of the really good ones, in my humble opinion.",1438473600,,1608,4.321192052980132

5410530,4,B00AEFY2WI,"Tommy Jarvis finally gets away from the mental institution and tracks down Jason's grave to finally convince himself once and for all, that Jason is really dead and buried. He travels with his friend played by actor Ron Palillo (Welcome Back Kotter) fame to the cemetery in the middle of a stormy night. Once there and locating the grave, Tommy seems bent on finding out if indeed Jason is really buried and decides to dig him up with the intention of burning what is left of the body. In horror movies, things don't always go as planned. Tommy lashes out at Jason laying there in the grave with a piece of black rod iron fence. To his dismay and his friend's, the rod attracts a few bolts of lightning that actually resurrect Jason right out of the grave and he isn't in the mood for socializing! Tommy's plans for a cremation turn into panic as his friend is killed trying to hit Jason in the head with a shovel. Jason's not amused, turns and plants his arm right through the chest of his friend, sending him straight down to Jason's former coffin. Tommy, fearing for his life, flees and drives his truck straight to any law enforcement official that will listen that indeed, Jason Voorhees the Crystal Lake killer is now alive and loose!
I have to say, reintroducing the camp counselor's back into the Friday movies since Part 2 was a bit refreshing. I liked this one in the series and would recommend it to anyone that loved the ending of Part 4, because frankly, this is where it should have picked up after that. Just my thoughts.
The image looks good and sounds good.

5410541,4,B00AEFY2WI,"I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, which started in 1980 with the mega-success of the first film. My appreciation has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's ""Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning"" on TV one night in the early 2000s. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer -- who increasingly becomes an infernal monster -- just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end. It's the camp-like settings of most of the series and the unstoppable malevolent force that is Voorhees -- Jason, his mother, or anyone under his diabolic spell -- that especially sets ""Friday the 13th"" apart from similar franchises.

The first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element with ""Part III"", which pretty much plagues the rest of the series with the exception of maybe ""Part IV"" and the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway.

Released in 1986, ""Jason Lives: Friday the 13th Part VI"" is notable for being the premiere of the zombie Jason as his rotting corpse is resurrected in the prologue indirectly through the actions of Tommy Jarvis and a friend who recently got out of the mental institution. This prologue also shows that Tommy didn't murder Pam at the end of ""Part V"" and that he was simply experiencing hallucinations from his trauma with the diabolic Voorhees spirit. Another difference with ""Part VI"" is that we finally get to see a busload of kids -- children -- at Crystal Lake, although they changed the name to Camp Forest Green. Tommy runs to the local sheriff to inform him that Jason has been resurrected but sheriff, of course, doesn't believe him (would you?). His hot daughter, Megan, is attracted to Tommy and, when youths start being slaughtered, the sheriff realizes that Jason is indeed alive.

Speaking of Tommy Jarvis, he's played by Thom Mathews here rather than John Shepherd, who was excellent in ""Part V."" Thom is an okay replacement but he lacks Shepherd's brooding charisma.

The film features one of the best Friday babes in Megan, played by Jennifer Cooke, although Pam from the previous film is my favorite. Other than that, though, the females in ""Part VI"" are weak, as far as physical beauty goes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as it makes the story more believable. Speaking of which, the campiness of ""Part III"" and ""Part V"" returns for this installment, particularly with the goofy paintball warriors.

As far as locations go, ""Part VI"" returns to the East for filming, being shot roughly 40 miles East of Atlanta.

Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, but -- with the exception of the 2009 reboot -- I don't find these movies particularly scary, although they have loads of jump scares. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not very scary, for me anyway. In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.

BOTTOM LINE: You either like the Friday the 13th series or you don't. ""Part VI"" is another retread of the same Friday formula with the distinction of Jason now being totally inhuman -- a horrific zombie -- and the addition of children at the camp. It also has a better story than parts III and IV with the sheriff and his daughter & Tommy going after Jason, plus Megan is one of the top Friday girls in the series.

The film runs 9l minutes and the cut version 86 minutes.

8550456,4,B00AEFY2WI,"Perhaps my favorite (meaning most rewatchable) in the series so far, just behind Friday the 13th Parts IV-V. So far, Id rank the films (most to least rewatchable) as 6-4-5-2-1-3.

Part 5 SIDEBAR:  Yup, Jason keeps getting almost, sort of, nearly killed and then keeps coming back alive and well like Wolverine.  Part IV ends after 12-year old Tommy (Corey Feldman; Friday the 13th Parts IV-V, The Lost Boys, Gremlins) killing Jason.  Likewise, part V ends with Tommy (now 17 or 18) (John Shepherd; Bless the Child) killing the Jason Voorhees copycat and gazing understandingly at the famed hockey mask. Yes.  In part V (and since the end of part IV), Jason Voorhees was, in fact, actually dead!  As for the timeline, part 1 took place in present day (1980), part 2 was 5 years later (so 1985), part III continued the next day (also 1985), and part IV took place in 1985 immediately after the events of part III starting with Jason in the hospital morgue (a la Halloween II).  Bucking the trend, part V jumped forward 5-6 years (so 1990-1991-ish).  Now, probably more of a writing flaw than anything, part VI takes us questionably about 10 years yet further into the future (soooo, 2001?) since the actor playing the notably older Tommy was 28 at the time and no specific mention of his age comes into play.

In this third and final installment of the Tommy Jarvis story arc (i.e., parts IV-VI), we open in a graveyard to find the now-adult Tommy (Thom Mathews; The Return of the Living Dead I-II) unearthing Jason Voorhees to assure himself that the murderer is truly, in fact, dead.  Upon discovering the muck-slathered worm farm of Jasons remains, a lightning strike actually resurrects the Crystal Lake killer into an undead monster.  And then, in a display of gory delight, that monster punches through a mans chest with his hand holding the heart outside of the torso!  This was the most exciting opening sequence of the franchise so farand it sets the stage for this fun movie!

Well after seeing Jason rise from the dead, Tommy is (understandably) frantic.  Of course, no one believes the guy who impersonated and massacred a serial killer and then spent half his life in mental wards screaming Jason is alivehes more powerful now!  No, sir.  Camp Crystal Lake and its town of the same name have changed their name to Forest Green to ease forgetting about all the grisly murders of decades past.

BIGGER, BADDER SEQUELS:  Jason just kept getting bigger, didn't he?  Part VIs Jason (C.J. Graham, 63; Highway to Hell) is often shot with some camera angles making him look a gigantic 7+ (e.g., the 2nd death scene).  In part V, our killer (Tom Morga; Halloween 4: The Curse of Michael Myers, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) was only 62however, he seemed bigger because the latex mask made his head look HUGE.  Likewise Ted White (64; Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter, The Hidden, Demonoid: Messenger of Death) followed Richard Brooker (63; Friday the 13th Part III, Deathstalker), Warrington Gillette (61; Friday the 13th Part 2), and the boy in the lake (Ari Lehman, 511; The Barn, Friday the 13th).  No complaints about itjust an observation.

Written and directed by Tom McLoughlin (Fridays Curse), this was actually the first movie in the series to actually feature the kid campers and our first franchise appearance of a truly undead Jason.  Embracing his supernatural status, Jason is really enjoying his fast walk. No need to run any morealthough his copycat killer wasn't running in part V either, this is the first time Jason takes his time.  Hes in no rush to reach his victims, he doesnt try to avoid being hurt (like, at all), and not even upwards of 20 bullets are going to stop him (far more and of greater average caliber than anything Myers endured in a Halloween movie).  Not only that, zombie Jason enjoys the same antics he did when he was very much alive.  He still likes to burst through splintered doors and ambush people from the water; he still likes his machete and uses it far more often than his hands, playing darts or improvised spears; and he still modestly hides his ugly undead face behind a mask.

Campy SIDEBAR: I felt that part III was incredibly hokey and parts IV-V were VERY campy (in this case, raunchy) in showing the breasts of nearly the entire female cast.  Quite to the contrary, part VI isn't really campy at all (in the hokey or raunchy sense).  Outside of a clothes-on sex scene (and no nudity at all), this may be the least campy movie of the franchise.  I don't even recall any profanity.  Id call it the most family-friendly of the series were it not for about 18 grisly murders. LOL

Whereas parts III-V punished seemingly random lakeside vacationers or residents who just happen to be in Jasons cursed habitat, part VI returns to its roots of punishing the staff of Camp Crystal Lake (now Camp Forest Green).

I love these movies in general, but (assuming Jason can enjoy anything) Jason seems to have a lot more fun in this one!  The gore-o-meter is higher than ever.  After that spectacular chest/heart punch death scene, Jason (with his lightning rod fence post) spears a man and flings his body over his shoulder, squishes heads, cuts through multiple victims at once, and twists heads off with spinning neck breaks.  He even makes a metal imprint of a victims face (as the frying pan gag in a Bugs Bunny cartoon) and back-breaks the sheriff (probably inspiring Tobys back-breaker in Paranormal Activity 3).  Parts IV-V were wonderfully fun to watch.  And while I may not quite call this one my new favorite (so far, in terms of story or overall quality), I feel it does boast the best combination or gore and death scenesmaking it highly rewatchable.

This sequel completes the story arc of Tommy Jarvis from his childhood trauma, his late troubled teen years and into his late twenties.  Admittedly, the story gets a little sloppy (e.g., discrepancies between Jasons purported cremation in parts V-VI).  But it rounds out a story with focal characters worthy of comparison to A Nightmare on Elm Street 1/3/7 (Nancy/Heather), A Nightmare on Elm Street 3-5 (Kristen 3-4, Alice 4-5), Hellraiser I-II (Kirsty), or Halloween 1-2/7-8 (Laurie).

Part IV was previously my favorite sequel, with part V is right behind it as my second favorite (so far) in terms of fun factor and rewatchability.  But with the solid death scene and gore quality along with the alchemically enhanced fun of an undead killer, part VI may now get my vote for the most rewatchable of the franchise (so far).",1510272000,,6548,4.756637168141593
