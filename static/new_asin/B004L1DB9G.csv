4399479,4,B004L1DB9G,"I was really surprised by this film.  It starts out kind of lame, even Steve Austen seems kind of lame.
Fortunately, it takes a turn for the better and I really got into this film.  When it was done, I wish it wouldn't have ended.
Steve's character had real depth, his dialogue was well written and delivered as well.
While the film is quite similar to karate kid, it was still an enjoyable viewing.",1308873600,,399,4.378378378378378
4399480,5,B004L1DB9G,"I am a big fan of Steve Austin movies.  I too recognized the ""karate kid"" scenario.  I am a high school teacher and plan to purchase a copy of this movie to show my students. This movie was well written and the characters were portrayed  very much like parents of the students in my classroom. This movie shows another side of Steve Austin as a mentor and a counseler to young people. I loved the interactions between the high school student and his parents. The movie reprsents a good example of how bullying can be overcome by developing the self confidence that all students can attain through parental support and of course through the help of Steve Austin.  This is the  message that Steve gives through this film that I would like all of my students to hear.",1306800000,4,764,4.507246376811594
4399481,1,B004L1DB9G,"Imagine living in a world where every movie plot is fashioned from the Karate Kid. In this movie it is boxing instead of karate. I must give kudos to the casting director for being able to find people whose acting ability were on par with Mr. Austin. At times the acting and script was so hokey I found myself laughing at the serious moments of the movie, such as when boy Matthew first tells his mom and step-dad he wants to box. The lines and acting were so bad, I thought this might be a comedy. This might be a good movie for tweens, but beyond that it's a bust. One bright spot was Emma Grabassky, the young girl who played Matthew's gf. I can't figure out how she slipped through the bad actors only screen.

What I really want to know is how does one get funding for this type of tripe? You go the studio and say, ""I have written a screen play stolen from the Karate Kid.  I have substituted the word ""boxing"" for ""karate."" I got Steve Austin to play Mr. Miyagi and he promises never to smile and to only speak in truisms. We are going to find worse actors than Austin, so as not to upstage him. We won't have a decent soundtrack either and the director is blind."" I think a movie about trying to sell this film would have been more entertaining.",1304899200,,1253,4.216666666666667
4399482,3,B004L1DB9G,"I have to admit I didn't go into this thinking I would be watching a '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Karate-Kid/dp/B0008JIJ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Karate Kid</a>' installment. Have to give credit to the copywriters - the dvd/digital download synopsis was cleverly deceitful.

Since Knockout followed the *exact* same formula as the aforementioned flick - it was predictably acceptable fare.

Although, again, I was under the impression that Austin himself was the star - and not the boxing version of Mr. Miyagi. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but clearly this is a family film intended for a much younger and broader audience. I won't be surprised if this finds its way to the ABC Family channel.

Interesting career choice on the part of Austin, and in comparison to a similar move, a quantum leap improvement on Vin Diesel's detestable movie 'The Pacifier'.

All things being equal - I hope producers will hook Steve into the '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed/dp/B00006JDW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed</a>' franchise. He's a natural for the role and I can completely envision the film: Basically a thousand-pound, granite-fisted, knockdown, drag out punch-fest. Actually, come to think of it, that's what I thought *this* film was about. :-D

I hope some producer realizes that Stone Cold in the 'Undisputed' franchise is a solid money maker - so make it happen.",1304467200,5,1480,5.929577464788732

And I pulled this out of my movie cabinet ,it was unopened so I said"" heck ,ill give it a shot"". that was a pretty bad mistake. Even though it didn't harm my brain with being so bad. But it was bad enough to say at the end of the movie ""wow, that sucked""

the  movie is not a extremely terrible movie but it is pretty bad. The movie is based on  a student who moved schools and is starting to get bullied because he was a private school kid. He talks with the school janitor who has a lot of boxing experience. The student goes to him to learn to box...he then joins the team and beats the best boxer in the league in 1 out of 3 rounds.........what? I'm sorry but I'm confused, Steve Austin trains this kid for about a weak and he instantly is converted from a nerdy little kid to a knockout puncher........whatever? no bad blood with Steve, I love the guy but this is my least favorite of his. 2 out of 5",1404691200,,1106,4.134883720930232

4399600,3,B004L1DB9G,"I caught this movie on a popular movie streaming service that is not Amazon (think red). Going into this movie, my expectations were low thinking I might be mildly amused by it. It was actually a little better than I thought. I think even Steve Austin would admit he's not exactly in the same acting class as say a Robert De Niro or an Al Pacino, but his performance here was actually not bad. If I had to choose, I would say he was probably the best actor in the film. He played his role well. He was believable. Unfortunately, his co-star wasn't. While Austin held his own, Daniel Magder was wooden and awkward and not in that awkward teenager, almost adorable kind of way. He didn't look comfortable in front of the camera and in a couple of scenes I could almost see Austin looking at this kid like ""Come on, give me something to work with.""

There were a few times where it felt like the movie was gonna fall apart, but somehow Austin held it together. Many other reviewers have likened this flick to the Karate Kid but with boxing. It sounds about right to me, only Ralph Macchio was far superior in his performance. In a way, this movie feels like a lower budget version of the Karate Kid. You may find yourself rooting for this movie, but at times it's hard to.

4399601,3,B004L1DB9G,"My decision to pick up Knockout was based solely on the cover art and the fact that it stared the indomitable Stone Cold. I didn't read the synopsis so I figured we would get to see Stone Cold take down a bunch of high school kids in the boxing ring, which is probably the most awesome synopsis for a film in the history of man. Instead, as other reviewers have pointed out, this film is a boxing take on the Karate Kid.

Knockout is decent family fare, I guess. But I can't watch this film and not see a missed opportunity. Imagine what could have been, a film about an unfair boxing league with  Stone Cold knocking out incorrigible teenagers left, right and centre. Maybe they could make a sequel to Damage (the reigning champ of Stone Cold films) that follows this line and then the masses would never need another film to be released again.",1365379200,,845,4.410256410256411

4399609,2,B004L1DB9G,"This is the worst of all the Steve Austin Movies. I am a big fan of STONE COLD and when I want to go see a movie with him in it I expect STONE COLD whooping azz!!
So far the only time I have seen it show through is in the Expendables!  I think this is even worse than ""THE STRANGER""  I enjoyed Damage quite a bit
I also liked The Condemned, although could of done without all the shakey camera shots. Hunt to Kill was pretty okay also I think I will watch it again
since I have heard it is better the 2nd time around. We want Stone Cold!!!! Whooping A$$!!!!!  I mean that is what made him Famous in the 1st place!
I ain't trying to go see Stone Cold Steve Austin in some wanna be heart string pulling crap movie. What's next a romantic comedy????
Throw bad guys through windows and doors and shoot guns! Oh btw wait for a a really good script/action movie to pull out the STONE COLD STUNNER which is what
all of Stone Cold's fans are waiting to see on the big screen!

4399610,5,B004L1DB9G,"Wow, I give this movie 5 stars. Steve Austin performance was Amazing for him to do. Usually, we see him in these beat em' up movies and his character is quiet and doesn't talk too much. But, wow, this movie give him a chance to show off his true acting skills and he pulled it off.

Maybe the other actors weren't as amazing, but Steve made them better. The story was good as well. With Steve in the movie, he managed to pull together a great movie, where you believed he was trying to help a kid to become a winner. Everyone else was telling the kid to quit and do something else. But, Steve was there to picked him up, helped him out of real trouble, and pushed him to ""just go for it!""

What I learned from the movie is that's Real Fighters don't run away, they stands tall and Fight! It's okay to be afraid, but what you do about matters. Even if you lose, you stilled tried. If you don't try, you lost already. Steve said these things and I believed him. :)",1315785600,,962,4.13903743315508
4399611,3,B004L1DB9G,"Matthew Miller (Daniel Magder) has moved to a new town with his mother Christine (Janet Kidder) & his new step-dad Jacob (Sean Devine) who he had his own issues with.  Matthew is a boxing fan with heavy knowledge of the sport as well as his grandfather was once a boxer & referee.  Coming to a new town also means being the new kid at school & as he made friends with Ruby (Emma Grabinsky) & Nick (Samuel Chu), he also made an enemy after asking out Teresa (Tess Atkins) in her boyfriend Hector (Jaren Bartlett) leading to constant bullying from him & his crew.  Once incident caused the school janitor Dan Barnes (Steve Austin) to step in & encourage Matthew to join the boxing club which he does behind his mother's back who didn't approve of it.  After Hector destroyed him in the first sparring match & Coach Harward (Roman Podhora) kicking Matthew out of the gym for what he did after the match, Dan agreed to train him which gave Matthew new confidence but after another incident with Hector, Dan arranged a boxing match between the two to settle the issue.  So while preparing for the fight, Matthew has to deal with relationships around him with other people such as Ruby, his parents, and Dan.

Other reviewers have compared this to ""The Karate Kid"" which it is in many ways as far as the story of a kid being bullied & someone stepping up to help him overcome it.  This was an enjoyable family movie & I have to admit that I liked the influence of boxing in this movie while the acting & script wasn't bad at all for this being straight to home video.  In the end, this is something I would recommend for a viewing.",1313712000,6,1625,4.411371237458194
