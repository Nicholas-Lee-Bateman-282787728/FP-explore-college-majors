7561813,5,B0192PERT8,"I've been tired of zombie movies for a while now, then I saw this movie's plot. There's so much amusement in this movie, assuming you don't take it seriously- which you shouldn't. There's also so much room for a sequel or two- I personally want to see zombie penguins just for fun. Worth it, enjoy the clear homage to 'Jurassic Park' throughout, and pray we get a sequel.",1457308800,2,371,4.470588235294118
7561814,4,B0192PERT8,"This is a made for TV SyFy Asylum horror. It is perhaps best described as a zombie animal tribute film to ""Jurassic Park."" Eden is the name of a zoo for endangered species rehab animals. It is head up by Dr. Ellen Rogers (Kim Nielsen) who as a single mom has her daughter  (La La Nestor) with her at work. She got her doctorate in ""captive breeding theory."" Dr. Ellen Rogers was the name of the vet in ""Animal Face-off."" In one scene she asks her daughter why she was making her toy animals fight.

An airborne viral outbreak that effect certain animal and not humans causes the animals to mutate and attack...and for some reason to get out of their cages too. Amber (Brianna Joy Chomer) an intern gave up her career in political science because ""homeless people scare me and I'm allergic to babies"" in order to work in a petting zoo. In one scene the doctor is on the phone and it appears she is talking to a police officer on a walkie-talkie.

The film is for Asylum fans who don't take their movies seriously. Rated TV-14. $9.96 US Walmart.  3 1/2 stars",1457308800,3,1056,4.372448979591836

The CGI(?) animals are terribly done. As we get more people into this zoo, a bunch of interns who have to spend the day helping the zoo people these are all bad actors too, the staff at the zoo horribly bad actors. The stereotypical characters don't help either. The girl too good to do this, the obnoxious little daughter of the woman running the zoo, the tough security chick who is really too over the top, the nerd boy etc. you get the idea. The only actor that may have a shot is Andrew Asper. So horrible acting, bad effects, bad CGI animals, obnoxious child and her annoying overacting mother make for a terrible movie. they should have at least tried to make it a fun bad movie, but no....it takes itself too seriously.

7561831,3,B0192PERT8,"This very low budget zombedy is to Jurassic World (2015) as Jurassic World (2015) is to Jurassic Park (1993); just rehashing things that we once loved in inferior form.  But it still has some personality and you can tell the cast and crew had fun with it.

Director Glenn Miller (Santa Claws, a kids' movie) doesn't have much horror experience, but he does bring a nice touch to this light-hearted, often humorous zombie movie.  The CGI is indicative of a quality similar to a ScyFy Channel movie of the week (e.g., Sharknado 2), which can be disheartening for some.  But the writing and filmmaking care bestowed upon the opening sequence offers a glimmer of promise.  Like an ad for Jurassic World (2015) we are introduced to Eden, a sanctuary for the world's animals and family-friendly fun education.

But when some infected white-faced monkeys (yes, the Outbreak monkey) are rushed to the veterinary infirmary we know that something is wrong.  In an effort to save a recently deceased monkey ethical lines are crossed and some experimental serum is used to revive itno clue what such a serum is doing here, by the way.  Now revived, the zombie monkey proceeds to leap onto the vet's face and throw her eyeballs at his medical savior.  I'd say that sets a pretty strong tone and I don't think I'm worried about the CGI effects any more, however marginal they may be.

Yes, the effects suck and I don't mind at all.  I should also note that these actors all seem to really enjoy their roles.  Their script may not be Shakespeare, but they are owning their lines and it's really refreshing.

Our zoo is modeled after Jurassic World (2015) and you'll see some direct nods to it (e.g., the design of the headquarters building, the animal tracking screen, the jeeps, and literally making the comparison in the dialogue).  But more like how Jurassic Park (1993) brought some visitors to beta-test and criticize the not yet open to the public facility, here we have college interns starting a pre-opening program.  Our John Hammond is Dr. Ellen Rogers (Kim Nielsen; Amityville Terror).

We find zombie giraffes, capuchins, lions, koalas, gorillas and lemurs.  What we don't find is quality gore or attacks.  That said, this movie really isn't ""mainstream good"" but I also really didn't hate it.  It was an enjoyable watch.  Although I admittedly won't ever be watching it again, I wouldn't warn people away from it either.  It has heart, and for that I look forward to whatever horror Glenn Miller does next.",1469923200,,2504,4.803738317757009

7561837,5,B0192PERT8,"Feeling a bit dubious, I watched this movie on Netflix the other night. I wasn't sure what I was getting into, but let me tell you, we have an undiscovered gem in this incredible zombie flick! The basic premise is that the characters get trapped in a zoo, which is quickly overrun by a zombie virus. Animals are escaping, running amok, and creating mayhem all over. It's like Jurassic Park, but SO MUCH BETTER... because ZOMBIES! Dinosaurs are basically just big lizards that stomp around, but you're ok as long as you don't get stepped on. But zombified gorillas: that is true terror! This film was horrifyingly deep and powerful. I mean, what if that really happened. Just imagine.

First, there's the writing. Oh my God. This film made me think, like really think.  I was already on the edge of my seat during some of these chase scenes, but then a character would offer up a nugget of wisdom like, ""Run faster, they're going to catch us!"" or ""hurry, let me in!"", or ""OUCH!""... and oh man. I was just blown away. I'm going to be pondering the depth of this film for days, maybe weeks. I'm sure it will stay with me forever, really.

Then there's the acting. If that guy in the tall gym socks doesn't win an Oscar, or AT LEAST get nominated, I'm gonna riot. RIOT.  I mean holy s***, that guy was just phenomenal. There were moments that I truly believed he was like, really scared.

And the special effects... This was some cutting edge s***. Obviously, it's difficult to get animals to act like zombies. I can't even fathom how they'd do that. And sometimes elephants just don't want to be ridden. But the director cleverly photoshopped in some photos of animals and BY GOD YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL. I mean, sure you could spend hundreds of dollars on computer-generated special effects, but Photoshop is cheaper and really just as good.

TLDR: Thought-provoking plot, outstanding writing, riveting performances from the actors - both animal and human - and special effects that really blew my mind. This movie has it all, except dinosaurs which are lame.",1464998400,4,2053,4.657458563535911

7561840,2,B0192PERT8,"watched zoombies (2016), which was every bit as bad as it sounds, which is too bad, cuz i LOVE to see human beings get their karmic comeuppance, and this flick would've seemed the perfect place for that to happen.  no dice. a jurassic park-like zoo is host to an animal zombie outbreak, and poorly acted mayhem with a healthy dose of terrible special effects soon follow. the one thing this stinker has going for it is its' very diverse cast. otherwise, it brings little to the table. a movie like zoombies needs to embrace its' terribleness and make sure to mix in some clever--or at least entertaining--dialogue. oh well. there was a funny scene where a zombie macaw hops up and down on his victim, repeating ""help me! help me! help me!"" there was certainly good energy in this movie, and everyone involved clearly gave their all. the computer effects looked bad at first, but definitely improved, and i applaud the filmmakers for using it rather than live animals. i imagine zoombies coming out of the same conversation that brought us zombeavers. what's next? ghoul-rillas? ant-flesh-eaters? the walking dead sticks? so bad, this movie. so, so bad.",1464566400,,1152,4.847715736040609
7561841,4,B0192PERT8,"ZOOMBIES

Anyone who has read my reviews before knows that I am a huge Asylum fan. They make some of the best/worst movies out there. I have been watching their stuff since the beginning. So any time a new film comes out from them I have to own it. So I was intrigued when I saw this one at the store. A movie about zombie animals and an outbreak at a zoo, sounds cool. Luckily it was exactly what I thought it would be, and was also a take on Jurassic Park.

A group of interns are arriving at an animal sanctuary ready to take on their new jobs. It just so happens that earlier in the day a drug used to help save a monkey cause a zombie virus to outbreak amongst the animals. So now as everyone is spread out among their respective areas they must find a way to survive among animals that were dangerous enough without being undead.

The  take on Jurassic Park is great and there are some funny moments, it is fun spotting them all. The move has some bad spots of course and some of the acting is terrible, not all but some. The really bad ones though make it so funny, very entertaining. Writer Scotty Mullen [The Coed and The Zombie Stoner] clearly is a fan of Jurassic Park as I am sure director Glenn Miller[The Coed and The Zombie Stoner]. You get a behind the scenes look on  the DVD mainly about the animals and a FX feature as well as trailers and a gag reel. Over all this is your typical Asylum flick.",1463961600,,1414,4.164835164835165
7561842,5,B0192PERT8,"Excellent movie - both plot and acting.  It's sure a different premise.  Yes, it does have much of Jurassic Park in it. Jurassic Park is even mentioned in the movie so you know it was deliberate.  Well worth the time to watch!",1463616000,,226,4.333333333333333
7561843,3,B0192PERT8,The cheese. Omg the cheese.  The cgi. Did I mention the cheese.  There was a whole can of easy cheese here. There is enough cheese here to keep your crackers supplied for a year.  Other the the cheesy effects. The cheesy acting. The cheesy blood and general grade c acting this is one awesome movie.

7561844,1,B0192PERT8,"If I could rate this any lower I would, but I can't. Just like I can't get the hour and half I spent watching this ""horror"" movie. The only thing horrific about this movie is the graphics, the acting, and the actors trying to blend with the cgi. If you think poor acting is a a good horror movie then this movie is for you. Otherwise don't waste your time.",1463011200,,356,4.1
7561845,1,B0192PERT8,"First, the films strongest asset Kim Nielsen  is GORGEOUS. Beyond that, unlike a lot of horror flicks, there are plenty of other people to get slaughtered.

Weak points are many. The CGI is in general bad, The story is in general bad. The dialog is in general bad. There is no nudity but plenty of blood and obviously fake gore.

The pacing of the film is decent, so if the talking doesn't manage to put you too sleep you might not get bored.

This film has all the feel of a made for SyFy channel film, It can't figure out if it wants to be campy or gory so it does a bad job of both and while a few scenes are darkly humorous the bulk fail on a dark comedy scale as well. I can't recommend this film too anyone, not even on 'the so bad its good' scale.",1462838400,,754,4.006666666666667

You KNOW it's gonna be cheesy, but they WORK with the cheesy and make it alright.
The girl and koala, THAT was scary and VERY unexpceted that the little girl lived!! When you see the monkeys run out of the lab you realize that this is just like any other zombie movie... but with zoo animals.
Okay there are A FEW things I couldn't get past... like the lions.. WHO DOESNT HEAR 4 OINS APPROACHING? And HOW do the 4 surrounded people just run away from said lions? The lions are just chilling there not trying to get them and all of a sudden they are running as fast as the jeep, then when the people crash the jeep JUST A FEW SHORT FEET IN FRONT OF THE LIONS they STOP and run way as if they aren't interested!!....

7561855,1,B0192PERT8,"I bought this locally with low expectations. It was cheap and I thought it would be funny bad. I was wrong. Most of the acting was mediocre or worse. The dialogue was mundane and predictable (you just know there is going to be a Jurassic Park reference and when it pops up is ""whatever""). The humor factor was virtually non-existent. The action sequences had all the excitement of a root canal. For the most part, the animals are low grade CGI except for the guy in the gorilla suit (who probably put on the best performance), although when the gorilla turns zombie it is CGI for the rest of the movie. The escapes aren't daring or even interesting. They are just silly: A group surrounded by lions within leaping distance simply run away on foot (in another scene these lions are racing with a speeding jeep with no trouble). People also escape from the gorilla pen by simply climbing up and out over the fake rocks--I guess the gorilla was too dumb to figure that out in all his time of captivity. Would escaped African elephants really let people climb on for a ride? Apparently, CGI elephants would. The grand finale is blowing up the aviary so the zombie birds don't spread the chaos. Other than zoo animals becoming the zombies, there is nothing here that hasn't been done and done far better. There no chills or thrills.

I don't give a damn about protocol!  This animal must live!  And it does, sort of, in a round about fashion.  But.  Almost instantly.  Its little friends go the same way and soon chomp to death a batch of numbskull doctors.  Naturally, as idiots abound in this zoo, they open the secured door of the lab, releasing the undead critters into the zoo.  To keep the movie going on this threadbare plot, these rambunctious beasties quickly infect all the other animals.  Its a race against time to see who lives and who dies.  Since they began this opus with a bus load of interns..........they had more than enough bodies to go around.

I have to say my favorites were the zombie giraffes.

It was an interesting concept, poorly executed.  None of the action lives up to the spiffy artwork on the DVD cover.  The CGI is sparse; the characters are very basic, straight out of central casting, stereotypes all.  The suspense is minimal.  There are no scares.  CGI splatter is not the same thing as good old fashioned gore.  And theres a little girl too precious for her own good (LaLa Nestor).

I found it entertaining enough to keep it for later viewings but its not top shelf material.  The screenplay must have been written with a crayon.  If you enjoy junk-food-flicks, not filling enough to truly satisfy, you might like this time waster.  I did, up to a point.",1458172800,10,1517,4.5783582089552235

8743677,1,B0192PERT8,"Uhm, no. Don't do this. In the first five seconds, you can just tell this is a doodoo movie. Omg, these people are really giving this movie 4 and 5 stars. It is so bad, my roommate and I laughed so hard some parts and the sheer stupidity. The acting is bad, the CGI is worse and I can't tell you how many holes there were and how many questions we were left with. If you like so-bad-it's-kinda-funny movies, go ahead and waste about an hour and a half of your life.",1495324800,,465,4.065217391304348

8743679,4,B0192PERT8,"I actually saw the previews for this on another low budget monster movie dvd and thought it was at least worth a look and for a couple of dollars, why not? The movie is actually pretty good when it comes to making a wildlife park/zoo a pretty terrifying place and you actually do have a lot of sympathy or dislike of many of the characters (the co-heroine's child is really, really annoying). The special effects aren't quite the greatest and you can tell what's a special effects shot as many don't quite blend in seamlessly with the scene but overall, a good fun movie and it does raise some disturbing questions about how a virus could cross over into different species with drastic and terrifying result and what it could take to keep such a virus contained or what would have to be done to destroy it.",1492214400,2,806,4.489795918367347
