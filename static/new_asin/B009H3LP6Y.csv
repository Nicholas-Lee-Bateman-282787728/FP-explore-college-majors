Things haven't been going so well for Turner Downing.  He's lost both his job and his girlfriend on the same day.  Despondent, he turns to a friend for a little moral support.  That is when he is introduced to a twisted website where members dare one another to commit strange and unusual acts--and then share these acts with the world by posting detailed videos.

It is on this website that Turner meets the beautiful and enticing Dara (played by Jessica Cameron, a newcomer who is quickly making a name for herself in the world of low-budget horror).  The game is taken to the next level when she convinces Turner to embark on a bloody rampage and post the videos documenting his violent crusades privately--just for her.

In a world where straight-to-video slashers are flooding the market and forgotten within weeks of their release, DEADLY DARES is a breath of fresh air.  Tim Ritter has created a compelling script, filled with unusual characters and a deliciously twisted script.  Fans of the 1986 cult classic, TRUTH OR DARE: A CRITICAL MADNESS, won't be disappointed.

8541565,5,B009H3LP6Y,"Tim Ritter, the independent film-making mastermind behind such classics as 'Truth or Dare?', 'Killing Spree' and 'Wicked Games' is back with a vengeance with his latest entry in his 'Truth or Dare' series which began back in 1985. The focus of this one is a down on his luck man by the name of 'Tuner' who ends up playing demented games of 'truth or dare' with a webcam chick with a thirst for violence. I don't want to give anything away because if you're familiar with Tim Ritter's prior films, you know that there's many twists and turns and it would be better to just go into the film and surrender to the experience that Tim and his team have cooked up. The film has all the required elements for a low budget exploitation film and also features 'dare segments' from directors all across the USA. Highly recommended to fans of Tim's legacy of films and to those who can't get enough of those low budget regional indie gore flicks!",1355270400,,935,4.5058823529411764
