6191392,3,B00HNR3Z28,"Man when you look at movies like ""Red Cliff"" & ""The Warlords"" & think of what Genghis Khan accomplished, your looking at the potential for a international monster epic with action that would be off the charts!!! Instead they made this...I am almost at a loss for what to call it. Some Buddhist Gandhi type character trying to convince a total Bad Ass  like Genghis Khan that his entire life's ambition & conquering the known world was all a big mistake!!! And now that your like 112 years old you should change your ways and seek out peace & harmony???  WOW looks like somebody missed the boat on this one!!!!!  I thought, Great we are finally going to get the story of the greatest warrior ever known done by his ancestors & portrayed by some awesome Chinese actors instead of John Wayne!!! But alas I was wrong & I am stuck watching ""The Conqueror"" Howard Hughes's guilty pleasure starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan. A movie that was filmed in a radio active zone that is probably responsible for the majority of the cast dying of cancer!!!!  So if you are like me & thinking this is going to be a plethora of ass kicking action worthy of the greatest warrior the world has ever seen, you will be disappointed!!!!  On the other hand if you would like to think of Genghis Khan as feeling totally guilty for conquering more of the world than Alexander the Great & bringing culture & unequivocal success to his people...well  then this is for you!",1397520000,6,1447,4.524904214559387

6191394,3,B00HNR3Z28,It was better then I thought. It even had a moral lesson in it. More fight scene`s would of raised bar.,1397347200,,103,3.9523809523809526
6191395,1,B00HNR3Z28,"Garbage...sub titles are too fast and the story is set in the most boring time of the Mongol empire. Amazon prime is stealing taking money for this crap. I intended to drop prime next reup becuase of the price increase but this reinforces the wisdom of that decision.
do not rent or buy this.",1396137600,,292,4.425925925925926

6191397,1,B00HNR3Z28,"One of the worst movies I have seen. The story was poorly conceived. There were no characters  development. Chinggis Khan turned pacifist? Longevity pills and resurrection? A boring journey of master Qiu meeting the great Khan. It could have been an interesting movie touching on philosophy of the Way, just phony Miracles.",1449446400,3,323,5.211538461538462

It covers a series of events which led to a non-violent period under the rule of Genghis Khan, something I didn't even know existed. My children (12 & 9) also enjoyed the movie, especially the well-choreographed fight scenes.",1429401600,3,274,5.111111111111111

6191403,3,B00HNR3Z28,"Okay acting, but drags on.  The Khan was a horrible killer of men and destroyed many society's cultures and heritage.  Good portrayal of a man struggling within due to a plaque, but goes on killing later.  Surely his higher power will never bless him for his continued killing of mankind.",1414195200,,288,4.72

6191405,4,B00HNR3Z28,"A Chinese film subtitled in English, Kingdom of Conquerors takes place in 1219-1221 during Genghis Khan's invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire. The film begins with the Great Khan's army suffering from a plague that causes the Khan to seek a legendary wise man who it is rumored can cure disease - and additionally possesses the secret of immortality. The bulk of the film follows the Mongol general sent to retrieve the wise man, and their journey back to the Khan. A strength of the movie is its attention to the conflicts within the traveling party: the monk and his students are strict pacifists, while the Mongols are, well, Mongols.

The film is visually very appealing, and although Chinese directors approach storytelling differently from American films, it was not hard to follow along. There is impressive depth to each character, including Genghis Khan, and enough sub plots to really get a good sense of the world.

I went in to this movie expecting it to be a B-roll film, but ended up having a lot of fun watching it. The only con is that the subtitles do move really quickly - read fast.",1410048000,7,1100,4.723958333333333

6191412,4,B00HNR3Z28,This is not the action packed type of film about Genghis Khan that I thought it would be but it was still very entertaining. The film covers some of the last days of Khan and the wise man that changed his life. There was some well done action for the folks like me (could have been more). It is the acting and storyline that will have me watching this film for years to come.,1399939200,14,375,4.081081081081081
6191413,4,B00HNR3Z28,"I expected a film that would include military strategy, battles, intrigue, and the often maligned massacres by the Mongol hordes.  Instead, this engaging film present a humanistic philosophical perspective that focuses on an idealistic premise.  The story is both well thought out, and capably acted.  This is a wonderful film for a thinking person.  The scenery, costumes, acting, and pace are outstanding.",1399680000,16,407,5.516129032258065

6191415,1,B00HNR3Z28,Poor storyline that was very boring. Focuses on a mongol guard on a mission from Genghis Khan. Watch the movie Mongol instead. It is a lot better than this junk.,1397692800,,161,4.4

8633822,5,B00HNR3Z28,"Loved it. Simply, one of the finest in the genre, in a class with Red Cliffs, Crouching Tiger, and all the films of the finest Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese and Korean casting guided by inspired directors who give over their footage to the best editors and give us...a film to keep and watch for a lifetime. History mixes with inspired cultural screenwriting to give us the best of both worlds: that which was, and that which might have been. All substantial facts are there, well grounded in the history of China, the west and the east. Do not miss this film.",1459555200,4,559,4.6
