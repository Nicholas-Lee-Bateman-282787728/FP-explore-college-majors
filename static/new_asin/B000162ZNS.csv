1974346,4,B000162ZNS,"This is a great instructional video.  It's like having the instructor in your house, but nothing like going to the mat yourself and learning hands on.  It has a ten minutes introduction with basic instruction of break falls and rolls.  Be warn though, these ten minutes of introduction is also repeated in the other two volumes.  Overall you get less than 30 minutes of instruction.  AND then you get ten minutes of advertisement.  I was really hoping to get different advertisements per volume, but no luck.  All in all good instructional, but you should go to your dojo.  The 30 minutes of instruction may not be worth the price of $30. = T",1169683200,37,642,4.619469026548672

1974348,5,B000162ZNS,"The instructions and quality of the Video are outstanding. The Kotogaeshi is showed from different attacks. I'm working to get the other 2 videos. For me Quality in instructions and Video is a plus, this DVD passed it with Flying Colors.

1974349,5,B000162ZNS,"Wow.. The kotegaeshi techniques here are great. Dye has an amazingly powerful aikido approach. The effective Yoshinkan style is clearly the foundation of his system. I think the late Gozo Shioda would smile looking at this. Now, you can do these throws smooth and soft and feel all spiritual, or you can slam the attacker hard to the ground/mat. This DVD-series is about self-defense in the real world. It takes a lot of practice though. Keep up the good work Sensei Dye! :)",1110499200,15,474,4.72289156626506
8007194,1,B000162ZNS,"Better off using Amazon prime video to find anything like this

 Do not waste your money

 The DVD contains a warning about using martial arts and a series of commercials for other fitness DVDs.

A very small portion is given to the proper technique for falls",1494288000,,259,4.543478260869565

8007196,3,B000162ZNS,"Material was excellent. Well presented and clear.
Very unhappy and disappointed that over 12 minutes at the end of the disc was ads for Yamazato Productions.
Twenty bucks for this? Not very impressive..

8007201,5,B000162ZNS,"THis is a good video which is clear, concise and to the point in demonstrating Aikido techniques. The instructor is clear and understandable in his explainations and comments. The techniques demonstrated are reviewed several times each. First, the technique is performed at normal speed, then a couple more at slow speed,then from different angles, and then once again at normal speed.
The video is good quality with good camera angles and sound is audible and clear.

The instructor apparantly has some law enforcement background, perhaps why you will notice that some of the Aikido techniques shown also contain some more agressive moves or attacks which isn't exactly Aikido principles, but perhaps coming from someone with law enforcement background, could be applied in certain situations. Just wanted to point that out. However, it doesnt take away from the Aikido techniques you can learn from watching this video. I give this video high marks!

8007202,5,B000162ZNS,very good dvd covering basic falls and hand throws for several different attacks.i plan on getting other 2 dvds in series. A must have for the aikido fan.,1336694400,,154,4.535714285714286
8007203,4,B000162ZNS,"I own ALL three of ""The Aikido Self Defense for the Modern Warrior"" series, and I really enjoy them.  I just wish they were a bit longer.  A half an hour is just not long enough, but 'Sensei Dye' does cover a lot in the short amount of time on each DVD.  This DVD focuses on ""The Kotegaeshi""-- basically, a wrist lock reverse throw.  There are so many variations of how you can turn the uke's or oponent's attacks against them.  There has to be hundreds (at least) of variations in Kotegaeshi alone--which is amazing, and why I love this MA so much!

I'll eventually be signing up for Aikido classes, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't learn a thing or two while watching this video. Practicing this stuff, is a good thing to get you ready for the dojo, so you'll at least know a little bit about what they are talking about and referring to. Especially if you don't know any even basic Japanese--which I do know a little bit. These DVDs are a great little tool to warm you up, get you going in the right direction... and finally, get ready for the mat. Veteran Aikidokas might really enjoy them, too, so they can continue to perfect their craft. That's just my personal opinion, though, so take it how you wish.

Anywho... like I said... these DVDs are pretty good and informative, but just so expensive and TOO DARN SHORT!!! It makes me hunger for more, more, more!! Which I'm sure that's exactly what these guys want if they continue to put more volumes out on DVD. This one came out a few years go, so these may be the only three they decide to put out. So........ until I can get to the dojo--being such a busy gal and all--these will remain my guides. I may need to spend a lttle bit more time on youtube, and read, read, read as well LOL!  But soon... it will be time to for me to 'put the belt on.' ;)",1283385600,7,1815,4.22543352601156
