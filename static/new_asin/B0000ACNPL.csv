7996872,5,B0000ACNPL,"Mr. Muggeridge recorded this in around 1973, when he was around 75.  He reflected on how we all think throughout our lives, and how our perceptions of life and ourselves gradually change, especially toward our own mortality. He talked of his own views toward death, and how he had accepted his own approaching death, while discussing his religious beliefs.  You will dream about him and what he said, for a while after looking at the video",1174521600,15,439,4.7631578947368425
7996873,5,B0000ACNPL,"I have the VHS version of this DVD, which was originally a European television show, and was also released in large, picture book format as A Twentieth Century Testimony.  There is a lyrical part where Mugg is in a graveyard musing on death, another where he contemplates his own waxwork at Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum. Very good bits where he walks through the places the Bible events took place at, in the desert and by the Sea of Galilee. Also shows Malcolm and Kitty at home on their farm, Kitty reading Newman aloud, and Malcolm at the typewriter in his study.

Those not familiar with Muggeridge or his writing are invited to meet him in his autobiography, The Chronicles of Wasted Time, recently republished by Regent College in a one volume edition including both The Green Stick and The Infernal Grove, along with the very brief fragment of the unfinished third volume, The Right Eye. Published in cooperation with The Malcolm Muggeridge Society in London, this edition also includes a brief introduction by Dr. Ian Hunter, author of his own lively bio. on Mugg. Having dipped into that engrossing volume, this DVD rounds out the picture of Mugg, or vice versa for those sampling the DVD first.",1171324800,19,1203,4.806763285024155
7996874,5,B0000ACNPL,"This is the EO TV show that the book, A Twentieth Century Testimony, was based on. It's an amazing 43 minute travelog, as it were, following Malcom around as he expounds and meditates, that sometimes seems to be about him and sometimes by him. He engages viewers in the first person, but the camera portrays him in the third. He holds forth on his dreams and visions, which seem to have always been with him, but have crept through his writings until he almost seems to be relating from another world. This video shifts scenes at least five times, with suitable segues between anecdotes, musical interludes and natural scenes for contemplation. As monks meditated on skulls, Malcom muses on gravestones. He feeds chickens at home on his farm, where his wife Kitty reads aloud from Newman. He recalls his past as a ""vendor of words,"" sprinkling in bits from George Herbert and John Bunyan, Saints Francis and Augustine. He contemplates his wax double at Madame Tussaud's, then loses himself in the wilderness in Galilee, or rather, he would say, finds himself. Someone has subtitled in the dates 1903-1990 at the beginning of this video in which he is still very much alive, lending an eerie sensation as if after the end scene at the Sea of Galilee, he got in one of the boats and sailed away. Somehow this video was wrongly listed as NC-17, when it very likely is actually rated ""G.""",1083974400,4,1384,4.699588477366255
7996875,4,B0000ACNPL,"It has been over twenty years now since this gentle testament first aired but it has lost none of it's freshness or vitality. Muggeridge was a prolific writer journalist who in the later part of his life became something of a christian apologist in rather a C.S. Lewis way. It is interesting that both men still have much to say to our present problems.
This Film is a kind of meditation for Muggeridge on his life, modern life and the relevance of the spiritual truths that Jesus taught for these things. We see and hear Mr. Muggeridge as he speaks of these things in his pastoral home in England and then In the Holy Lands (most notably the biblical wilderness and the sea of Galilee). It is very enjoyable to share these things with him and we ourselves can then bring our own vistas(inner and outer) to his , a very enjoyable thing to do. A sort of meditation between his own and ours.
I liked the film which I found pleasant to the eye and spirit.",1010880000,9,952,4.3841807909604515
