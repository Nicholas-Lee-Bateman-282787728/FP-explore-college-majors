He is always very good as he was in this movie although he is in it for 15 min. The story is of a killer who goes around killing all of these would be masters while trying to obtain a  document that would overthrow the government. One of these men that the killer is tracking down is played my Meng Fei. The killer states that
""He is merely an agent of the sword"" and that he must kill people. Whatever!! What is amazing is that Leung Kar Yan was the action choreographer on this movie and played in it as this movie is horrendous. This must have been his early attempt at breaking away from Shaw Bros. movies as this was a low low budget affair. Originally called  ""Push for Power"" but re-titled by Xenon. The print is good and sound is excellent but you can avoid this one. Also look for Chen Sing as the ruthless villian who dies within the first five min but mysteriously comes back to life at the end. I feel asleep 4 times and it took me 3 days to  finish watching this waste of film and talent.",983232000,,1168,4.136563876651983

Great sword action, and some creepy, violent fight scenes.  A must have for Wu Tang colletors.",981504000,2,247,4.833333333333333
7882770,3,6305104867,"This movie is classic. When your in a bad mood it's good to watch because it is kind of ruthless. The most classic line, ""I am merely that agent of this sword"". This guy goes around killing people with a secret  sword, saying it's not him, it's the sword!",960249600,,255,4.204081632653061
