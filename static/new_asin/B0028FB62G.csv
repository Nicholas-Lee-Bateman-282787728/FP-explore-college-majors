8356187,5,B0028FB62G,"I also bought this item after reading the initial review by Andrea R, I was apprehensive about having to put up with subtitles. Instead, I was able to watch the movies in French with no subtitles. What a great value. Just the 2 classics (Le corniaud and La grande vadrouille) usually will cost more than what I paid for,  Everything about this package says quality. Just loved it.",1306886400,,380,4.588235294117647
