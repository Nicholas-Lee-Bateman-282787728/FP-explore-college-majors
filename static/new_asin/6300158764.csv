213909,4,6300158764,"A decent thriller about an attempt to assassinate the POTUS in a town called Suddenly. Sinatra as the psychotic villain gave a believable performance as did al the other members of the cast with two glaring exceptions: Sterling Hayden as the sheriff offered some pretty wooden acting, especially at the beginning of the movie. The other unacceptable performance was that of the kid, who managed to be only annoying.

213911,4,6300158764,"I purchased Image Blu-Ray product (with UPC 0 14381 82005 8, Amazon ASIN: B00960EHUE) and I regret to report that it is not in the original aspect ratio of 1.75:1 documented at IMdB.com.  This is the equivalent of 15.75:9 and should almost horizontally fill a standard 16:9 flatscreen television without cutting off any part of the vertical image.

It is rather a ""standard version"" in 1.33:1, the usual tube ""TV screen"" size with typical black bars on either side, same version being aired on various over-the-air stations of late, even including rounded corners like those on 1950's TV screens.

I don't doubt the assertion that Image ""remastered from 35mm master"" but that image is not in 1.75:1 as anyone can see.  However, given its age (1954) it is quite possible it is actually filmed 4:3, or filmed both in standard and widescreen format as were many transitional movies at the time; viz., Bell, Book, and Candle with Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak.  The widescreen version of that film has somewhat more horizontal image, but the standard version has almost as much horizontal picture but much more bottom picture information, and is NOT merely a ""pan and scan"" truncation of the widescreen version; rather they were 2 distinctly different editions, apparently deliberately issued in this manner to accommodate theatres with old screens and theatres with then-new wide screens.

In any event, the product at hand is not ""widescreen"" by anyone's definition.

BTW, I love this taught little drama, which has 4 of my favorite actors: Frank Sinatra (whose acting I much prefer to his singing), studly Sterling Hayden, and old-timers James Gleason and Willis Bouchey, each giving of his considerable best.",1473120000,,1706,5.071428571428571

213927,4,6300158764,"I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting. I mean it. On the screen, Sinatra can be an absolute giant, like he was in ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Other times, he can just ""phone it in"" and be Frank. Let me assure you that he most certainly did not phone his performance in for ""Suddenly."" I also was not entirely sure what to expect of the plot, which centers around an assassination attempt on the president in the small California town of Suddenly. The obvious parallels between Sinatra being such good friends with John Kennedy are chilling, but that is where the strangeness ends, thankfully.
I originally wanted to see this film because I felt it would be worth my while considering two of my all-time favorite actors -- Sinatra and Sterling Hayden -- are in it and it sounded like it had a plot deeper than just the stereotypical ""lone nut"" assassin. Fortunately, I was right about this, as Hayden's character development is rich and interesting enough in the first 25 minutes that in a strange way, you forget Sinatra is due to make an appearance. Not only this, but the plot advances at light speed once Hayden (the local sheriff) is alerted that the president will be stopping unofficially in the town.
When Frank Sinatra finally does make his entrance, the plot takes a surprising and violent turn which I won't ruin for you. But I'm telling you that the dialogue and acting in this film were very good to begin with and magnificent among the main players for the last 3/4 of the film. It's far more than just Sinatra's assassination plan vs. Hayden's efforts to foil it. The film becomes a genuine suspense thriller with enough head games to raise the film above the level of the usual 1954 flick, in my opinion.",1461801600,,1724,4.637254901960785
213928,5,6300158764,"One of my favorite movies of all time - a hidden gem - Frank Sinatra as an extremely deranged (and extremely skinny) psychopathic contract killer who plans on killing the president when he stops at the small town of Suddenly.  Sterling Hayden is top notch as the tough as nails police chief who gets embroiled in the drama.  a little bit dated and a little right-wing (the love of gun motif should appeal to the second amendment folks) but still lots of fun.  I would normally give this movie a four star review - I was turned on to this film by a high school teacher back in 1975 - have watched it many times since but always a pretty crappy copy.  well, the fifth star is for this restoration which is nothing short of miraculous - the blacks and whites pop out at you and the picture has never been clearer.

SUDDENLY stars Frank Sinatra as psychopathic hired presidential assassin John Baron, who with two compatriots take over the hilltop home of retired Secret Service agent Pop Benson (veteran character actor James Gleason) in the small town of Suddenly (""that's a funny name for a town...""), who lives with his widowed daughter-in-law Ellen (Nancy Gates,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THIS-LAND-IS-MINE/dp/B00A2536DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THIS LAND IS MINE</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SOME-CAME-RUNNING/dp/B00143XE1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SOME CAME RUNNING</a>) and grandson ""Pidge"" (Kim Charney).

The novel and the film were also a favorite of President John F. Kennedy, who was also a ""Friend Of Frank.""  Although Sinatra later had a falling-out with Kennedy, his daughter Nancy has stated that Frank cried for three days straight upon learning the terrible news of the President's murder.  After the assassination, Sinatra asked that both SUDDENLY and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE be withdrawn from circulation out of respect for the fallen leader. A rumor had circulated that Lee Harvey Oswald viewed SUDDENLY the month before the assassination, but was investigated and found to have no basis, archetypal of the myriad theories surrounding Kennedy's death.

Upon the cusp of the home video age, SUDDENLY had fallen into the Public Domain, and began to show up on TV. When the VHS era began, suddenly there were eventually dozens of home video releases of SUDDENLY, all mastered from whatever battered prints could be found. In the 90's, a Roan Group LaserDisc purported to be a definitive version, but was hampered by incorrect matting and occasional battered reels. Later versions such as one from Legend Films are touted as ""fully restored"" (and also adds a colorized version), but they're now worth as much as those old video tapes compared to this Image Entertainment/Blackhawk Films release.  Trust me, YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY! (Hopefully, not by John Baron)......

This was made in 1954, when Eisenhower was President and Nixon was next in line. [What could they have been thinking?] The beginning argument about a toy gun for a young boy is a sign of changing culture; there would be no argument years earlier. [Or was this just for dramatic effect?] Johnny Baron thinks his job is a joke: if one is killed another steps in to take his place. Thats true, but ticket balancing usually means a change in personalities and politics, and the forces that each politician represents. This is unmentionable. The dialogue reveals the assassin as a psychopathic killer. Killing made Johnny feel good after his hard youth. Macchiavelli said men are rewarded for doing things in wartime that will get them hanged in peacetime.

Their diabolical plans come to naught due to the sacrifice and patriotism of common men. The good guys win again in this movie. This movie is still entertaining, and worth watching as popular culture from the 1950s. Their evil plans come to naught due to the sacrifice and patriotism of common men. The good guys win again in this movie. If they had succeeded these killers might have outlived their usefulness. Most US Presidential assassinations were done by amateurs for political reasons (Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley). So too the attempts on Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Truman, Reagan, Ford. JFK? Robert Blakey had his solution, but it didn't give the reason why, or, why the Attorney-General didn't pursue the killers. What can we assume?

I think any professional killer would turn this job down because of the extreme likelihood of getting caught and punished. Unless he was sure higher-ups would protect him. [Oliver Stones JFK showed how it could work in the real world.] This Movie Classics DVD says Digitally Remastered but it doesnt look that good.

Guns aren't necessarily bad, it depends on who uses them says Todd (a peace officer). She tells her son to remove that pistol. Todd says the boy must learn about the world. A confidential message on the telegraph tells of an emergency! A special train will arrive with the President and security must be provided. Sheriff Todd makes arrangements. Secret Service Agents arrive in town.

The stores facing the train station must be inspected. That house on the hill too. [Is a lone mother the best guide for a son?] Pidge spots the caravan of cars on the highway. Todd shows the routes to that ranch. They want the stores closed before the President arrives. Three strange men arrive at that house on the hill, they say they are FBI Agents and want to look around the house. Nobody leaves the house. He explains why - to protect the President. No strangers were in town. This isn't routine. The Sheriff and Dave Carney arrive to inspect that house. The visitors reveal their true nature! A passing train muffles the shots. The criminals set up a table by the window for a solid base. The leader says he won a Silver Star for killing 27 enemy soldiers at Cassino. Pop has a pistol but the cartridges were hidden! [No gun locks were required then.] Todd knows what will happen: no witnesses left behind.

Johnny shows his leadership. The TV repairman visits to join the captives. They wait for five oclock. Johnny asks for food. He tells about his youth. Johnny says he doesnt know who he is working for! [Motive?] Johnny learned a skill in the war that he used to earn a living afterwards. [For some its auto mechanics.] The criminal sent into town is caught, the shooting warns the police. Johnny acts to solve this problem. Pop Benson suggests a fix to the TV. Pidge retrieves the pills and that pistol! Todd tells the criminals they should leave with what money they already received. But something goes wrong! The shooting is a warning. It didn't stop! The actions of ordinary men prevented the assassination. Pop Benson will be alright, the TV repairman didn't make it. Todd will get a reward. [It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.]

This is an interesting story in itself and as a picture of small town life in 1950's southern California. Note the importance of the railroad. Movies charged 25 cents for admission. Ten cents bought a comic book [before they were attacked to eliminate competition to television].

During JFK's 1960 run for the White House Sinatra and his Rat Pack buddies campaigned like crazy for JFK. Kennedy won the election and became President. As history says, JFK. was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald, a former United States Marine. Oddly enough, at the time of Kennedy's murder Sinatra was starring in a movie called ""The Manchurian Candidate"" A movie about an Army Sergeant that had been brainwashed by the North Koreans during that war and was being set up as a patsy to take the fall for the assassination of the president. Very strange indeed
This movie, like suddenly is in glorious black and white and is a definite ""must see and must own"".",1421971200,,1244,4.6289592760181

I never knew this movie existed & I firmly believe after watching it that this movie did have something to do with the planning or idea for the Kennedy assassination. I could not believe that I had never heard mention of this movie. I am certain that Lee Harvey Oswald and those that hired him as a pay'ed assassin surely must have watched this movie. It was nearly 10 years prior to the Kennedy assassination so they had lots of time to plan the presidents murder. I was 6 years old when the president was murdered and remember the moment I heard the news (I was in school, in the movie room) like it was today. Our teacher turned off the projector and announced that President Kennedy was assassinated. We all stared at each other asking what does that mean??

Someone recommended the Hal Roach Studio DVD, with the claim that it was mastered from ""original 35mm safety fine grain"" print.

Then I saw the 2009 colourised version. The image was better, sharper, but the breaks and missing dialogue were still evident.

The 2012 Blu-ray version truly is obtained from a 35mm master print. The quality is what one would expect of a Blu-ray remastering. There are no breaks and no missing dialogue. The extras are well done. The extra colour film from 1957 is an experimental item and is only of interest if one happens to like that sort of thing.

SYNOPSIS--
In the small town of Suddenly, three men masquerading as FBI agents take by force a house overlooking the train station. They plan to assassinate the President of the United States shortly after his 5 pm arrival. The triggerman is a jumpy WWII vet who's proud that he won a Silver Star for killing 27 enemy soldiers. The gang's captives include a former Secret Serviceman who lived after catching a bullet in the heart while guarding President Coolidge, his widowed daughter-in-law, her 8 year old son, 'Pidge' (Kim Charney) and the town's sheriff, who's shot in the arm during the initial struggle for their home.",1358208000,4,2649,7.314465408805032

If you are reading this review on it's correct page you're probably a fan of the film wondering ""Will this be the release where they FINALLY get it right? The answer is a resounding YES! YES! YES! Transferred from the original 35MM fine grain master print, the crisp, clear beautiful black and white transfer is also finally reproduced in the correct aspect ratio and exhibits added picture information on all four sides compared to the literally dozens of earlier Public Domain VHS tape, LaserDisc and DVD releases. It also has two New Audio Commentary tracks, one featuring Frank Sinatra, Jr. (!) and the other by Dr. Drew Casper, Professor of American Film at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. There is also a Short Film by Francis Thompson made in 1957 titled N.Y., N.Y.: A DAY IN NEW YORK, and an Image Gallery.

SUDDENLY stars Frank Sinatra as psychopathic hired presidential assassin John Baron, who with two compatriots take over the hilltop home of retired Secret Service agent Pop Benson (veteran character actor James Gleason) in the small town of Suddenly (""that's a funny name for a town...""), who lives with his widowed daughter-in-law Ellen (Nancy Gates,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THIS-LAND-IS-MINE/dp/B00A2536DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THIS LAND IS MINE</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SOME-CAME-RUNNING/dp/B00143XE1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SOME CAME RUNNING</a>) and grandson ""Pidge"" (Kim Charney). Sinatra chooses the location since it overlooks the train station where the President is due to make an unscheduled stop.  SUDDENLY was Sinatra's first film after his Academy Award winning ""comeback"" role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FROM-HERE-TO-ETERNITY/dp/B00005JKF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FROM HERE TO ETERNITY</a>. Upon release it garnered good critical reviews including those in The New York Times and Variety. Sinatra's co-star Sterling Hayden (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-ASPHALT-JUNGLE/dp/B000244EWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE ASPHALT JUNGLE</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JOHNNY-GUITAR/dp/B0082LUGPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JOHNNY GUITAR</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DR-STRANGELOVE/dp/B000055Y0X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DR. STRANGELOVE</a>) anchors the picture as town Sheriff Tod Shaw, who loves Ellen, but even though three years has past she still cannot come to terms with her husband's war death.  When Hayden accompanies Pops' former Secret Service co-worker Carney to the house, Carney is killed and the Sheriff is wounded.  The movie remains taut and exciting until the inevitable, but surprising conclusion.

In what became a strange coincidence, Sinatra had a lead role in another film about a planned presidential assassination, 1962's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MANCHURIAN-CANDIDATE/dp/B004LORX5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE</a>, but this time as the hero.  A terrific movie with a terrific cast, based on the popular novel by Richard Condon.  Sinatra's acting in the film is considered by many as his finest film performance.  The novel and the film were also a favorite of President John F. Kennedy, who was also a ""Friend Of Frank.""  Although Sinatra later had a falling-out with Kennedy, his daughter Nancy has stated that Frank cried for three days straight upon learning the terrible news of the President's murder.  After the assassination, Sinatra asked that both SUDDENLY and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE be withdrawn from circulation out of respect for the fallen leader. A rumor had circulated that Lee Harvey Oswald viewed SUDDENLY the month before the assassination, but was investigated and found to have no basis, archetypal of the myriad theories surrounding Kennedy's death.

Upon the cusp of the home video age, SUDDENLY had fallen into the Public Domain, and began to show up on TV. When the VHS era began, suddenly there were eventually dozens of home video releases of SUDDENLY, all mastered from whatever battered prints could be found. In the 90's, a Roan Group LaserDisc purported to be a definitive version, but was hampered by incorrect matting and occasional battered reels. Later versions such as one from Legend Films are touted as ""fully restored"" (and also adds a colorized version), but they're now worth as much as those old video tapes compared to this Image Entertainment/Blackhawk Films release.  Trust me, YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY! (Hopefully, not by John Baron)......

ADDENDUM: There have been reviews of another new version from HD Cinema Classics that seem very positive, but mention that it doesn't have Image's Extras or Commentaries:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SUDDENLY-Blu-Ray-DVD-Combo-Pack/dp/B0089X37VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SUDDENLY Blu-Ray + DVD Combo Pack</a>

2nd ADDENDUM: I sprung for the HD Cinema Classics release and I can report that they also did a good job. I have to give the nod to the Image/Blackhawk disc however, it seems to have a slightly better picture and the commentary by Frank Sinatra Jr. is a surprise.  The HD Cinema Classics version has a also contains a regular DVD, has a different commentary, and a poster reproduction postcard, and which may be attractive to some buyers.  Either way you can't go wrong......

This black-and-white movie released in 1954 was withdrawn for several years at Sinatra's request after the assassination of his friend John F. Kennedy. It is only 75 min long and the sound quality is poor by present-day standards, but it is tense throughout that time and all the cast play their parts well. Some aspects of the Sinatra character, and even some of the dialogue he has, were reprised when he played arranger Barney Sloan in Young At Heart.

He follows that up with this role as a through evil criminal who is going to shoot the president. The president plans to travel through this little burg stopping at the train depot on his way to somewhere else. Sinatra & his two goons captured a family & their home as the perfect spot to get off a shot at the president. The tension mounts as it is several hours before the presidential train arrives. The Sheriff is grievously wounded as he, his girl friend, her son &  father are held hostage. Sinatra is showing his range playing a psychopathic ex GI who likes to kill.

214062,4,6300158764,"Intense, sometimes hokey thriller of small time hoods led by a surprisingly good Frank Sinatra, paid to assassinate the president when he makes a train stop in a small town. They take a family hostage, and cat-and-mouse game ensues. Sometimes obvious, some weak supporting performances, stagy. But still more fun and tense then most modern Hollywood thrillers.

A warning, I've tried several different versions of this on DVD and all I've seen are far from great looking transfers.  I believe the film is in the public domain so many versions are out there, often taken from mediocre (or awful) sources. The recent blu-ray has by far the best image I've seen (which is not to say perfect), but it's in a 1:33 aspect ratio, as opposed to 1:85.  I've read some vehement arguments as to which ratio is correct, without seeing anything that seemed conclusive.  Historically, more films in 1954 were still being shot in the more square 1:33 (especially smaller black and white films as opposed to epics), but - for what it's worth - to my eye the framing in 1:33 looked a bit odd.",1276560000,,1075,4.732620320855615
214063,2,6300158764,"We tend to think of Frank Sinatra as a singer or the leader of the ""Rat Pack"" and forget that he could be a damn good actor. He won an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1954 for his performance in ""From Here to Eternity"" and was nominated 2 years later for his role as a heroin user in ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" (he lost to Ernest Borgnine for ""Marty""). In 1958 he won his second Golden Globe for ""Pal Joey"" and was nominated in 1964 for ""Come Blow Your Horn"". He was awarded Golden Laurels for his work in ""Pal Joey"" (1957) and ""Some Came Running"" (1959) and was nominated for ""Von Ryan's Express"" (1965), ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962), and ""The Devil at 4 O'clock"" (1961). In this film, Sinatra does a good job, although it's not at the level of his award winning performances.

""Suddenly"" was made immediately after ""From Here to Eternity"". It tells the story of an ex-Army man who attempts to kill the President during a brief stopover in the town, Suddenly. Prior to this, killing the President was not a particularly common thread in films, although there were films about real assassination attempts or stories in which the assassination was a major plot point, such as ""Brigham Young"" (1940), ""All the King's Men"" (1949), ""The Desert Fox"" (1951), ""Viva Zapata"" (1952), ""Julius Caesar"" (1953), and ""I Killed Wild Bill"" (1956). But these were actual attempts - fictionalized stories about the assassination process itself were extremely rare, and rarer still with the President as the target.

""Suddenly"" co-stars the great Sterling Hayden, the king of film noir (""Manhandled"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"",  ""The City is Dark"", ""The Killing"", ""Naked Alibi"") and a masterful actor who gave us outstanding performances in films as diverse as ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954), ""The Last Command"" (1955), my personal favorite ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964), ""The Godfather"" (1973), and ""King of the Gypsies"" (1978). In ""Suddenly"" Hayden plays the local sheriff and he does so with his usual intensity and style.

James Gleason appears as a former secret service agent who owns the house that Sinatra commandeers for his assassination attempt. Gleason appeared in more than 100 films between 1922 and 1959. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" in 1942, losing to Donald Crisp as the father in ""How Green Was My Valley"". He usually appeared as the wise cracking side-kick, and gave us memorable performances in ""Meet John Doer"" (1936), ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" (1945), ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" (1944), and ""The Last Hurrah"" (1958).

Willis Bouchey puts in an appearance as a secret service agent. Bouchey appeared in nearly 100 films. I remember him best as the President in ""Red Planet Mars"" (1952) and as the conductor in the last scene from ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962) who says ""Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance."" He was in ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953) with Sinatra.

Lewis Allen directs. He was a prominent Broadway and London stage director before turning to films in 1944 with Ray Milland ""The Uninvited"". He worked with Milland on several more films and also with Alan Ladd, Burt Lancaster, and Edward G Robinson. He made the transition to TV where he worked on ""Bonanza"", ""Perry Mason"", ""The Rifleman"", Route 66"" and ""Mission Impossible.""

The New York Times called it a ""taut little melodrama"" and Variety called it a ""smart piece"". The Hollywood Reporter said that Sinatra was ""one of the most repellent killers in American screen history"".

Although ""Suddenly"" has often been compared with ""The Desperate Hours"" (1955) in which Frederic March's family is held hostage by Humphrey Bogart and his stooges, they are two very different films and represent two different genres. ""Hours"" is the last of the Bogart villain films and in some respects is the last of the gangster films that were popular in the 30s. It came, as did the 30s films, from the headlines. Some people claim that ""Suddenly"" fits more into the film noir genre, with themes reminiscent of such films as ""The Big Night"" (1951). Personally, I don't consider ""Suddenly"" to be film noir, as it lacks some necessary aspects, such as the night setting, the cast of sleazy people encountered along the way, the femme fatale, etc. I think ""Suddenly"" is the start of a genre that focuses on political assassination, and as such gave birth to an industry - ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (1962), ""The Prince of Power"" (1969), ""Executive Action"" (1973), ""The Kidnapping of the President"" (1980), ""Hour of the Assassin"" (1987), ""In the Line of Fire"" (1993), ""Shadow Conspiracy"" (1997), ""Blind Horizon"" (2003), etc.

In 1959 a novel called ""The Manchurian Candidate"" was published, and was made into a film in 1962 starring Frank Sinatra. It was eerily similar to the theme in ""Suddenly"" and in less than a year, JFK would be assassinated and his suspected assassin was thought to have viewed the film just before killing JFK. This cast a cloud over both films and they are rarely shown any more.",1269648000,2,4995,4.87396937573616
214064,4,6300158764,"My continuing exploration of film noir finally brings me to Frank Sinatra's only true essay at the style, which actually seems to fit his nervous, energetic approach to acting at the time quite well.  Here he is the leader of a group of assassins planning on taking out the President (for cold hard cash - there's little to no political content here) as he stops in the small California town of ""Suddenly"". Opposing him are the town's sheriff, the always watchable Sterling Hayden, and Secret Service agent Dan Carney (Willis Bouchey), who happens to be friends with James Gleason's Pop Benson, a former agent who is now retired and who owns the hilltop house that Sinatra and company plan on using to carry off their deed (with a high-powered rifle).

Most of the film ends up taking place in the house, as a tense hostage situation plays out through the back and forth between Sinatra and Hayden. It's all fairly well paced and taut; director Lewis Allen isn't usually named as one of the greats in the genre and indeed he doesn't seem to know what to do with all of the too-large cast in the short running time, but the basics work out pretty well, and Sinatra's tormented, sweaty and nervous characterization makes the film a must for devotees of the psychopath.  It's too bad ol' blue eyes never ended up working with a great noir director like Fritz Lang or Robert Siodmak or Orson Welles, when you think about it - his ability to flip-flop from nervousness to cold menace to hysteria works extremely well in the paranoia-drenched world of noir, and it's interesting that in the one other film he made that sometimes gets labelled as belonging to the style - THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE - he played the straight hero type, not the psycho.  Also interesting that Sinatra kept that film out of circulation after the JFK assassination - but this film, also dealing with the attempted murder of a president - fell into public domain.

The DVD I have (from Image) is fairly mediocre; I have no idea if other labels have done a better job with it, but the careful consumer should shop around.",1263686400,,2089,4.650406504065041

214087,4,6300158764,"With some remarkable similarities to the Kennedy assassination, Suddenly (1954) is a tense, gripping drama, where an ordinary family becomes involved in a plot to assassinate the President of the United States.  Frank Sinatra is John Baron, the leader of a group criminals, that have invaded the Benson residence, because it has an ideal view of the train station, from where Baron plans to shoot the President, when his train stops in the small town of Suddenly.

It was an ordinary Saturday in the Benson household.  Peter 'Pop' Benson (James Gleason) and his noisy grandson 'Pidge' (Kim Charney) were trying to repair a broken television, then three men arrive posing as secret service agents.

Pidge's mother Ellen (Nancy Gates) is distraught, as the assassins set up a tripod mounted rifle on a table, aimed out a window at the train station, and Baron details just how he plans to kill the President.

Sinatra is quite riveting as an arrogant, egomaniacal, ex-military type with a chip on his shoulder.  There's plenty of emotion and drama as an overconfident Baron, expounds about what he is going to do and why.  It's a pretty good plan, that just isn't executed very well.  Baron is ruthless, repeatedly threatening to shoot the child, but fortunately he is not very competent.  A real pro, would not have so many people running loose in the house.

214089,5,6300158764,"Just about all the reviews on this page are about how the remasterization is, so I'll talk about the film itself.

It starts out looking like the beginning of an Andy Griffith episode. In the small town of Suddenly meet Ellen Benson, an everyday sweetheart single mom who's husband died in the war, her Opie-like son, and the town police chief whom with she shares a mutual but repressed on her part attraction. All three are lovable, but painfully ordinary. Next we learn the president will make a two-second train stop in their little town, and CIA agent are swarming the train station. A visitor claiming to be such an agent (Sinatra, who took 15 mins. to show up)asks to ""check the house"". You saw it coming. Sinatra's Jonny Baron is a hitman hired to kill Mr. President, choosing Ellen's house overlooking the train station as a shooting point. The day goes on, and the death count rises,and Baron somewhat inadverdently reveals more of his psyche.  But what would have been just your average home-invasion thriller is made into something more with Sinatra's tour de force performance and a very compelling script showing a thorough anatomy of a madman. After your average happy Hollywood ending, suburbia has reverted to its normal state.
Like The Manchurian Candidate, Suddenly! was withdrawn from circulation by Sinatra after the JFK assassination and showed up thirty-odd years later in a cheap public domain version. The film is not at all scary (this is coming from someone who's never seen something scarier than Jurassic Park)yet manages to be thought provoking and fully entertaining.",1251158400,,1598,4.9812734082397006

He's a very good actor and it's surprising that this film isn't better known. Moreover, the movie raises issues that are still relevant: mysterious forces behind presidential assassinations, what can ordinary citizens do in the face of evil? what should mothers do when their kids want to play with guns? It's also a reminder of a day when most American men had served in the military or were familiar with guns.

214117,3,6300158764,"Predictable ending to a typical post-war script.  They are hitting you over the head without any subtlety.  The theme is that pacifism doesn't work, sort of like preaching to the converted, since it is a POST-war film, not a pre-war film.

A war widow spurns the advances of the town sheriff and doesn't allow her 8 year old son to play with guns.  There's your pacifist, the war widow.  By the end, she's ready to kill the bad guy herself.  As I said, there's no subtlety to the script.  It is obvious, unoriginal, completely predictable, and therefore juvenile and uncreative.

Sinatra's acting is no big deal.  It's laughable the way people rave about it.  It just shows that any silly old nonsense can impress people.  He's not terrible.  He's just a non-actor doing a more or less decent enough job in a silly script.  You can't compare his acting to his singing.  He was an exceptional stylist as a singer, and a hack as an actor, as you should be able to see in this movie.  To compare his acting to a singer, you might say he is the Freddy Cannon of actors.  You remember the guy who sang that silly song Palisades Park.  Maybe you don't.  You shouldn't.  It's nothing, like Sinatra's acting.

This film is nothing but stereotypes.  I'd be ashamed of it if I had directed it.  There are no real people in it.  There are no believable lines in it.  It's just one of those stupid stories of the early fifties to make a point, that Americans are this or that way, that we gotta shoot some bad guys.  Okay, whatever.  Sure we have to shoot some bad guys.  You don't need to convince me.  I'm not a pacifist.  But I know a dopy script when I see one.

I'm giving it three stars for entertainment value.  Even though the movie is dopy and completely predictable, it's kind of fun to watch.  That's worth a few stars.  The writing gets an F, the acting gets a D, but the entertainment value gets a C plus or B minus, and it isn't hard to sit through.

There's one part that is so stupid it cracked me up.  Sinatra sends one of his bad guy assistants outside to check things out, when what he really wants is to keep his presence secret.  So he sends out one of his bad guys to become very visible.  Hahaha.  And of course the bad guy is spotted and blows Sinatra's cover.  That is the funniest part of this dopy movie.",1151798400,3,2319,4.317016317016317
214118,5,6300158764,"A long, withheld movie of historical and musicological interest,that has taken on increasing interest. Why? Frank Sinatra, the star, the Voice, withdrew the film following the assassination of JFK, because of the mob ties. Nevertheless, this B noir movie is better than you expect. Among the supporting cast lies a real WWII hero,Sterling Hayden, who gives a restrained performance, playing the sheriff in the small town with the responsibility to see that the president's train gets through without incident. However, Frank Sinatra and his gang of co-conspirators plan to remove the responsibility, by using his girlfriend's lofty house above the railroad tracks.

No one since the first screening has given this film digital enhancement in any way, which makes it play out like you'd see it in your town theatre. Although this begs for a modern re-doing, it stands on its own as a look at Sinatra the actor, playing a creepy thug with a chip on his shoulders. He plays it very well, as if the producer told him he would be getting back at all his detractors. Sinatra pulls it off convincingly, making everyone uncomfortable in his presence, as if he's going to explode like a bomb with a short fuse,emotionally threatening and leering at the same time. And he's not ""Maggio"" here either, the same punk ""From Here to Eternity."" Even Sterling Hayden admires him as he ranges like a captive lion in confinement. Psychotic, unbalanced and self-assured around his weapons or just handling them, it is one of Sinatra's most realistic portrayals. Just when the script slows, a glare or scowl from Sinatra and your pulse takes off. Sinatra made a lot of toss-off films, this is not one of them. For him, the part was probably like himself between rained-out gigs, holed up in Palookaville, as Gay Talese indicated in his short story,""Sinatra Has A Cold."" If it is ever re-made, and I doubt that it will be, it is one film that is nothing without Frank.",1147392000,5,1946,4.86144578313253

 The time period is the early 1950's. Some of the key components of the assasination plot are strangely reminiscent of the Kennedy assasination.

 I absolutely hate Frank Sinatra as an actor, but I feel this part was cast just for him. Probably his best role. He plays the killer, and leader of the plot. Sterling Hayden plays the town's Sheriff. The Deputy is a Dennis Weaver type guy similar to Chester on Gunsmoke. James Gleason plays the ""Crusty"" Retired Secret Service Agent, whose house is inadvertently used as the place to shoot from. It's full of ""characters"" real characters.  It's fun to watch the the towns people all try to get in on an important event. A visit by the President of the United States. This angle provides some great laughs.

It's not everybody who can pull off a menacing tough-guy when he weighs 118 soaking wet.  This film presents itself in stark tones both visually and thematically.  Patriotism, courage, honor, sacrifice.  The words necessary to make that into a sentence would only sully the higher meaning; and that's the feeling you get as you watch this film.

214122,4,6300158764,"The Western town of Suddenly was once bustling with gold prospectors, but ""things happen so slow now, the Town Council is figuring to change the name to Gradually."" That is until one day when the President of the United States schedules a stop in Suddenly and professional assassins aim for it to be his last. Town Sheriff Tod Shaw (Sterling Hayden) is notified that the President will be arriving on the 5 o'clock train. A team of Secret Service men arrive to make sure the town is secure. But 3 assassins led by John Baron (Frank Sinatra) are a step ahead of them. They take over the Benson house that sits on a hill overlooking the train station and hold the family hostage, terrorizing and threatening retired Secret Service man ""Pop"" Benson (James Gleason), his widowed daughter-in-law Ellen (Nancy Gates), and her young son Pidge (Kim Charney), waiting for the train carrying the President to arrive.

Frank Sinatra's cold-blooded, loquacious assassin John Baron is ""Suddenly""'s driving force. He's amoral, self-absorbed, and only in it for the money... and the self-respect. Baron mocks even his clients who paid him so much money to shoot a President who will be replaced in a matter of minutes.  John Baron is an interesting enough guy to listen to -thanks to Frank Sinatra's intensity, but the character is striking because this film was released in 1954, when a World War II hero was in the White House and the nation was enjoying the prosperity that war had brought. Yet John Baron attributes his killer instincts to his experience as a soldier, for which he was awarded a Silver Star. He says of killing in the Army, "" They taught me how, and I liked it."" ""After the show I hooked up with an outfit for good dough.""  Screenwriter Richard Sale emphasized the irony in a presidential assassin who learned to kill by fighting for his country. On top of that, John Baron is played by a draft evader.

Frank Sinatra makes ""Suddenly"" tick, but he has a nice foil in tall, handsome Sterling Hayden, whose Sheriff exudes warmth in contrast to Sinatra's assassin. Nancy Gates' primary role as Ellen is to be overprotective of her son Pidge, which she does convincingly and with great conviction. Actor Jim Lilburn, playing television repairman Jud Hobson, provides a little accidental comedy when his Irish accent comes through at moments of high emotion. Lilburn was Maureen O'Hara's brother and also went by the stage name James O'Hara. ""Suddenly"" is a tight, entertaining  little thriller driven by Frank Sinatra's star power. Its violent, cynical veteran is considered by some critics to place the film within the definition of film noir.

Film noir regular, Sterling Hayden, plays the town Sheriff, the town being Suddenly, CA.  Sinatra's acting is so realistic it is downright scary at times.  The plot is good, and Hayden is good, as always, but it is Sinatra's performance that lifts this film above being just another average B-movie.

214124,5,6300158764,"Frank Sinatra is riveting as a cold-hearted hit man obsessed with his spurious war record, who traps a family in their house, along with a few others that get caught in his net, as he plots to assassinate the president, who is making a stop in Suddenly, California, on his way to Los Angeles. It's a great character study, and Sinatra pulls it off flawlessly, making this a taut thriller, with a quiet, folksy beginning that turns into a nightmare.
Sinatra followed his Oscar Award winning performance in ""From Here to Eternity"" with this film, which unfortunately hasn't been seen much, and one of the reasons is Sinatra himself; he was horrified to know that Lee Harvey Oswald had watched ""Suddenly"" shortly before the Kennedy assassination, and requested the film be pulled from distribution.

Co-starring Sterling Hayden who is excellent as Sheriff Tod Shaw, it has well paced direction by Lewis Allen, a crisp script by Richard Sale, and a score by David Raskin. There have been other films with this type of hostage scenario like the '55 Humphrey Bogart ""Desperate Hours"" and its 1990 remake, and this is up there with the best.

214146,3,6300158764,"*Suddenly* is an intriguing little film about a plot to assassinate the POTUS (President of the United States).  The premise is groundbreaking, considering the period it was made in, the ""I Like Ike"" years.
Frank Sinatra is pretty good as the wack job hired by some unknown plotters for the job of whacking the Prez.  There's some decent acting from a few of the supporting players, especially the one who plays the old retired Secret Service agent.  Sterling Hayden, whom I really like in *Asphalt Jungle* and *The Godfather*, doesn't shine for me in this one.  I'll bet he was bored.
The trouble with *Suddenly* is that it's a low-budget thriller that set its sights too high.  You simply can't believe that a big-buck-backed assassination plot could really transpire like this.  It's just too hokey.  At the same time I give the film credit for making the old college try.  'Cause that's what *Suddenly* feels like--a film-college noir, strong on bold concepts but weak in the pocketbook and experience.  Having a gang of desperados headed by a maniac impersonate a team of FBI agents so as to knock off the president was a brilliant idea for a film of '54, but this idea, great as it was, is stillborn in *Suddenly.* If it had been about a train heist or a small town bank robbery, it could have worked a lot better.
I'm a personal friend of Alan Wexler, son of the late Paul Wexler who played the deputy sherrif, Slim.  He gets shot (but not killed) when trying to arrest one of the gang.  Al has a lot of cool stories about growing up in Hollywood during the '50's and 60's.  He was just a little runt when *Suddenly* was made so he doesn't remember much about that one.  Still, it's a part of his life, and as his good buddy, it's a part of mine too.  Get *Suddenly* and get nostalgic.",1083196800,4,1792,4.507739938080495
214147,4,6300158764,"Just two years before he made Suddenly, Frank Sinatra thought he was finished. His vocal cords hemorrhaged, and The Voice almost fell silent. Movie producers lost interest in making musical comedies starring the Kid from Hoboken, and no one took him seriously as a dramatic actor, a field where he had no track record. And he could feel the love of his life, Ava Gardner, slipping out of his grasp. (Although Sinatra and Gardner had just married in 1951, following his divorce from first wife, Nancy, the affair had been going on for years, and the wedding was anti-climactic.)
Well, Sinatra got his vocal chords fixed. And after a manic lobbying campaign, he got the role of a lifetime, as the heroic but ill-fated, ""Pvt. Angelo Maggio,"" in 1953s From Here to Eternity. With Sinatra's help, the movie won eight Oscars, including his own, richly deserved one for best supporting actor.
For the next 12 or so years (through Von Ryans Express), until one of the longest midlife crises in world history took over, Frank Sinatra was among the worlds greatest movie actors. Unfortunately, the third part of his life could not be saved. By 1955, he and Ava Gardner had split up, though as she wrote in her autobiography, Ava, they would have occasional reunions in hotels around the world, over the next 30-odd years, until her death in 1990.
Going for the role of Maggio was a huge gamble for a man who had no history of straight dramatic acting. But then, Sinatra was nothing, if not a gambler. Existentialism was then a popular philosophy, but unlike pretentious types in French cafes, who knew only the words, he knew the music. From his thirties through his mid-forties, Sinatra lived a life of continual high drama, subsisting off tempestuous passions and guile, with little room left for prudence. (But unlike professional existentialists, Sinatra was no nihilist.)
And so in 1954, he starred in the kind of insane movie that could have ended his fledgling, dramatic movie career. Suddenly (what a lousy title!) is the name of a California hamlet, where the President of the United States will happen to pass through, for about the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. Only the Secret Service knows this  and a small group of assassins posing as Secret Service agents, led by Johnny Baron (Sinatra).
Johnny is a homicidal sociopath who has no qualms about doing what was then the unthinkable. Sure, I like choppin (shooting). He has a $500,000 contract to kill the President, and so kill him, he will.
(Sinatra would go on, in 1962, to co-star in yet another movie about a plot to assassinate the president, The Manchurian Candidate. Directed by the late John Frankenheimer from Richard Condons classic political thriller, in Candidate, Sinatra gave a now hilarious, now moving performance as insomniac Capt. Bennett Marco. But the following year, his friend, President John F. Kennedy, would be assassinated, and so for the next 30 years, Sinatra would get Suddenly and The Manchurian Candidate pulled out of distribution.)
The era of the anti-hero had just begun, with Marlon Brandos 1953 performance as motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler, in The Wild One. But not even the young Brando had guts like Sinatra. No one had shot a president since William Big Bill McKinley in 01, and no one made movies about assassins.
But Sinatra did. Working almost entirely on one set, on a shoestring budget, and squaring off against dramatic (and physical) heavyweight Sterling Hayden (as Sheriff Tod Shaw), he gave a towering performance.
Johnny and his accomplices take the Benson family hostage; their home has a clear shot at the spot where the President will get off his train. Pop Benson (James Gleason) is a retired Secret Service agent, whose widowed, pacifist daughter-in-law, Ellen (Nancy Gates) has been rebuffing Tod Shaws attempts at courtship. Ellen Benson holds all who wield weapons equally in contempt.
Johnny likes to talk, and he has a captive audience. Literally. The set-piece around which the picture revolves, is the spellbinding soliloquy Johnny delivers, on his failed life as a civilian prior to World War II, as a lost soul, wandering about an anonymous, non-descript, unnamed metropolis.
Before, I drifted and drifted and ran, always lost in a great, big crowd. I hated that crowd, used to dream about the crowd, once in a while. I used to see all those faces, scratchin and shovin and bitin. And then the mist would clear, and somehow all the faces would be me. All me, and nothin.
This is not the spirit of America on the eve of World War II, but of a different time and place altogether. It is the spirit of Hitlers Vienna on the eve of World War I, the spirit of fascism.
Now, I realize that logically, this doesnt jibe. After all, Johnny doesnt work in a collective, the way the fascists and Nazis, or the anti-Semitic socialists of pre-WWI Vienna did; hes more of a freelancer. And spoken abstractly, overlaying a 1910s, European mentality doesnt work for a story set in America in the mid-1950s. And yet, it does work, gloriously.
Here's the background: During and after the war, with the help of Soviet communist propaganda  to paper over the Soviets 1939 alliance with Nazi Germany -- many leftwing artists, academics, and journalists mindlessly pushed the notion that ""fascism"" was merely political gangsterism. This attitude was perpetuated most dramatically by communist playwright Bertolt Brechts entertaining play, written in 1941 in Finnish exile, The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui.
But Suddenly doesn't owe its power to the propaganda of Bert Brecht, or of leftwing academics or journalists. Give credit, instead, to screenwriter Richard Sale, director Lewis Allen, and to  The Gambler.

Sinatra & two thugs are hired to Oswald the Pres.  But before Sinatra enters, we have dialogue between semi-Arnett sheriff Hayden and his lady friend, a woman who lost her husband in WW II and seems to be dodging reality. At an early point one telltale sign is given when the lady, while rebuffing the sheriff also listens. And, the sheriff is loved by her son and father.
Sinatra's crew enters the lady's house while the sheriff is there, posing as FBI agents. Then they take over the house, coldly shooting a Secret Service agent who is there visiting. The house overlooks the train's stopping point, again relating to JFK.  The toy that Sheriff bought for the son comes into play. For some strange reason Sinatra deploys one of his thugs to check the station area.  Being recognized by a deputy, there is a quick brutal exchange of gunfire.  Sinatra, still seeking the 1/4 million due on completion of the task gets more vicious. But, the other thug gets careless. Don't worry.  When the first gunshot is fired between the thug and deputy, the SS telegraphs  train and Pres. to speed through the town with no sudden stop.
Sinatra plays an excellent role being at ease in a despicable cold role, despite his Section 8 military past. Hayden's role is believable.  Pops is also likable. But the quiet shy shaken lady suddenly finds courage to take action, almost like a mirage. And at the end, she is standing by her car inviting the sheriff to join her (finally) at church the following week. The ensuing kiss is as flat and out of place as knight's armor in ""Saving Private Ryan.""
The movie moves along even though a bit of the banter is more obvious than necessary.  Sinatra is highlighted for his talents and shows true acting ability.  Contrary to others, I find  Hayden to be believable and in character.
The film is shot in black and white to try and highlight contrasts between good and evil.  This is also too obvious.
I have problems rating this video as a Film Noir.  At the same time I wonder why those who have complained about the poor quality of the DVD version forget that VHS still exists. The VHS copy is clean and has good shots as well as inclusive sound.
This is a very good film, especially for those who like action without sex or cussing.  It is stark yet one has to wonder if Sinatra as gang boss who carefully planned the hit could be so stupid. Maybe this adds to the realism: ""A sure sudden thing.""
I recommend the VHS version. It is less than 1 1/2 hours and much better than scores of films twice as long.  This highlights Sinatra and shows ""what if.""  One has to wonder if the film was shown to Secret Service and FBI agents before the JFK murder. If not, why not? Barring it for a while afterward???
Rent or buy used via VHS and enjoy. Add to your collection. The price is right in VHS.  Adding this to ""The Man with a Golden Arm"" (with Kim Novak) along with a few LPs/CDs creates a fine inclusive collection of Sinatra's artistry and film library.

Hot Toasty Rag, September 15, 2017

If you liked The Manchurian Candidate, you're not going to want to miss out on Suddenly. Suddenly is the name of a small American town, but its also a metaphor for the plot, which is reflected well in Lewis Allens tense direction and Richard Sales smart screenplay.

Nancy Gates is a widow, trying to raise her young son properly while falling in love with Sterling Hayden, the town sheriff. How can she teach her son that guns are bad, because his father died in the war, but the man vying to become his stepfather uses a gun to keep the peace in town? While that isn't the main plot, its the underlying theme and the motivation behind her character.
The President of the United States is slated to pass through Suddenly as a good-will gesture to small time Americana, and just before his stop, three strangers arrive in town. The leader of the group is Frank Sinatra, and he charms his way into Nancy Gatess home. ThensuddenlyFrank and his gang are holding the family hostage as they prepare to assassinate the president.

The film is very tense, and an extremely entertaining ride. I wouldnt bother to pop corn during this one; you probably won't look away from the screen long enough to grab a handful. Frank Sinatra does an excellent job as the slightly-psycho assassin; hes not over-the-top, but hes sufficiently scary so the audience doesnt expect him to start singing. I liked this movie a lot, but if you don't think youll like seeing Ol Blue Eyes as the bad guyeven though the movie is in black-and-whiteyou might want to rent From Here to Eternity instead.",1505433600,,1622,4.664335664335664

Thus the subject matter of the 1954 film under review, Suddenly, an assassination attempt on the President of the United States as he passed through by train the Podunk fictional town of Suddenly out in California was a little shocking. If I had seen the film in 1954 at a time when I knee-deep, as were many of my fellow film critics, in attending Saturday afternoon matinee double features I probably would have passed it off as another great B-film noir effort. And at some level that was my reaction recently as well but the film brought to the surface more questions than I would have expected for such an old time film.

The plot-line was like this if it helps the reader understand my perplexity. In advance of the unnamed President (although if you go by the original 1943 story the film is based on Active Duty by the screenwriter here Richard Sales hard it would have been Franklin Delano Roosevelt but by the films release Dwight Eisenhower) heading to some Western mountain retreat the town of Suddenly was suddenly (I couldn't resist that, sorry) infested with all kinds of cops, feds, Secret Service, naturally, state and local cops. The important one of the latter here is Sheriff Shaw played by gruff he-man type Sterling Hayden. With all this police action it was fairly easy for a bunch of guys led by John Baron, played by Frank Sinatra, to pose as FBI agents and gain access to a primo location at a house across from the railroad station where the President was expected to stop. That house also just happened to be the home of Sheriff Shaws hoped for paramour, a war widow, her son, and her ex-Secret Service father.

After a series of ruses Baron and his boys set up for the ambush in a position in the house and with a rifle that reminded me of what the situation was like at that 1963 Texas School Depository. But remember this is 1954 and fiction so that you know that this plot like many others before and since would be foiled before the dastardly deed was consummated. Foiled one way or another although not before a senior Secret Service agent was killed and Sherriff Shaw was wounded and taken hostage along with his sweetie and her family. The long and short of it was that the plot was foiled by the heroic action of that son, that paramour, her father and even the Sheriff. So you can see the film to get the skinny on the how of that.

What is of interest, beyond the excellent job that Frank Sinatra did of playing an ex-soldier who learned to love to kill, who gained self-respect and dignity during World War II when he could freely shoot on sight anything that moved and nobody thought anything of it and the good job Sterling Hayden did as the Sheriff also an ex-soldier trying to figure out Barons motivation for shooting the President. Baron was nothing but a flat-out psychopath who had no more feeling about what he doing and who he was doing it to than the Germans he wasted in the war. I have seen guys like that, saw them during my own military service, saw them at the VA hospitals too when they completely broke down. With this caveat in Barons case he was a hired killer, was being paid big money, half a million, no mean sum back then, by unnamed sources to perform his task and blow the country. Who was behind it and their motivation didn't interest him.",1490486400,,3703,4.507440476190476
7803899,5,6300158764,Frank Sinatra is great in this movie. The colorizing was excellent. The B&W version is also included. Yes this is a Public Domain movie but the copies on the internet are poor quality. The DVD was made from a clean print and is well worth the few dollars. This DVD is from Legend Films. I have a few of their DVD's and I can say I'm well pleased with their colorization work.,1484784000,,375,4.222222222222222
