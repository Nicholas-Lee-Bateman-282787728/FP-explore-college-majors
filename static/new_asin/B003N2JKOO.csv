8400619,3,B003N2JKOO,An enjoyable trip down memory lane. I was a bit disappointed with Railroad Stowaways (the reason I bought the product) as the quality was not to good. I used to have a super 8mm print of the movie and the quality was much better.,1524787200,,229,4.2272727272727275
8400620,3,B003N2JKOO,the shorts are terriffic but the quality is so bad. If you love silent comedy it is well worth the couple dollars price,1416787200,,119,4.217391304347826

8400622,5,B003N2JKOO,"Though dated it might seem to the young, this set of films is so historically valuable to the archives of the movie industry, that any students of movie making, lovers of original films around the time of the industry's birth or folks who wish to see a bit of early Los Angeles (actually most of the Keystone Cops adventures were filmed in the hills of early day Glendale-long ago flattened for development!). The restoration is good enough for one to feel a sense of entertainment from these early mementos of the California dream...",1388707200,,534,4.752688172043011

8400624,3,B003N2JKOO,"five shorts about 9 minutes each some bad some good.

A Desparate Scoundrel 1915. early and disjointed. but fun. a lot of hand movements. it did make sence but actualy lots of silly antics typical of silent comedies. so no dissapointemnts here. Though I only rate this one 3 1/2 stars

Muddled in Mud. this one was ruined by cartuney sound effects and an attempt to add a bit of spoken blurts here and there. If one didn't watch but only hear one would think this was a cartune. There was too many hand antics to substiture for explaining of ideas...which didn't work anyway. and there was confusion in the love interest we think one is the desired suiter and continue from that aspect for about half the movie. The unexpected turn around confuses for most of the movie. a weird movie apparently thinking everyone in the drained lake mud is supposed to be a riot. but it was just weird.  It was this second Ford Sterling movie on the disc that made me decide this guy aint so good. I give this one 2 stars.

Race for Life. this is anything but funny. carnival music for about half of the movie makes no sence. then the race gets on and we get pretty good music that fits. the ""Race"" was pretty good and it appeared a pretty dangerous occurrance, so it's a wonder how they got as much time as they did, but that's drama cinema for you. the underlying logic and the very disturbing ending make one wonder if there wasn't a madman at the helm of this one. I rate this one 3 stars.

Taxi Doll. it started out with promice and got confusing in a hurry. it eventualy makes some sort of sence, but quite silly overall. if this really is 1929 it's pretty poor for the time frame though it looks like a 1918ish sort of effort. I give this one 3 stars..

they saved the best two for last. Wispering Wiskers was funny and clever. I gave this one 4 stars.

and they have a bonus short talkie featuring an early Bing Crosby effort. funny and short and sweet. some might be bothered by the black humour but it wasn't in bad taste ...just a good and humourous cover for the story to work. I gave this one 4  stars as well.",1340928000,,2107,4.276381909547739
8400625,1,B003N2JKOO,The sound hisses all the time. The picture is unwatchable. This DVD was transferred from a very bad film copy or even some crap VHS.,1326585600,5,132,4.32
8400626,3,B003N2JKOO,"ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.

The five silent shorts in their MACK SENNETT'S FUN PARADE are augmented by an early Bing Crosby talkie.

SYNOPSES--

BARNEY OLDFIELD'S RACE FOR A LIFE - Sterling and cohort Hatton chain Mabel to RR tracks, then start an engine toward her. Boyfriend Mack enlsts the aid of famous race car driver Oldfield. A spectacular split-second rescue is the result.

CROONER'S HOLIDAY - Bing the plumber wants to wed with Christy, but her mom (Ward) objects. The ambitious mother heads to Hollywood with her unhappy child in tow; Crosby's close behind. Der Bingle croons three times here: on the title track ""Dream House,"" plus ""It Must Be You"" and ""When I Take My Sugar To Tea."" (Un-P.C. alert: includes our hero corked-up like Jolie or Cantor.)

A DESPERATE SCOUNDREL - As Directed by Charley Chase, villainous Sterling drinks the milk in an infant's bottle then replaces it with water. While flirting with laundry worker Durfee, Stirling spots a bundle of cash; he grabs it and runs. A patented Sennett-style chase is the result.

MUDDLED IN MUD - A Sennett comedy created on the fly. When Mack heard that nearby Echo Lake was to be drained, he set up on shore and told his actors to get down and dirty. Back at the studio, a prefacing story was then created. A superb example of KEYSTONE's often improvised shorts.

TAXI DOLLS - Directed by Del Lord (of later 3 Stooges fame). In this late-era silent comedy, inventor Cooper causes a sensation with his latest creation: a cyborg (Vance) that looks like a pretty girl.

WHISPERING WHISKERS - Andy and Billy are stowaways on a train. Felix Adler, who scripted several of Laurel & Hardy's later Hal Roach films and wrote most of the 3 Stooges' two-reelers, provided this one's intertitles.
