7913407,2,B00000JSIE,"When I watched this anime fifteen years ago I was stunned and loved it. However I suppose over time my interests shifted from blatant run about stories with no perspective growth regarding character/story development to animes that provide a riveting and compelling story. If you've seen the prequel to this, then by all means you will enjoy this as well without a doubt. In comparison to the first season, this story fell short unfortunately",1364688000,,442,4.986486486486487
7913408,5,B00000JSIE,"I have never see a series that could manipulate a plot like this anime has. I showed 3 different senarios based on the same world but different demensions. This series has romance comedy action and adventure all rolled into one big ""yet to small for me"" series. I can watch them over and over and never get bored for you notice something new about it each time. Take a look at the other el hazards they are just as good hell may be better ""but i dought that""",1009497600,,458,4.215909090909091
7913409,4,B00000JSIE,"This is DVD disk 2 of 4.
The ""Alternate World"" series continues with a deepening of romantic relationships and infatuations of those in love.
Continuity Notes: El Hazard the ""Alternative World"" is the 3rd El Hazard series. The original ""Magnificent World"" is the best, so start out with that one. The ""Alternative World"" series is continuation of ""Magnificent World"" and is not part of the ""Wanderers"" series.
Cautions: This series is the most adult of any of the El Hazard series. Lots of sexual inuendo like a sitcom, but nothing really happens.",1007856000,2,547,4.956521739130435
7913410,5,B00000JSIE,"El Hazard : The Alternative World continues the beautiful story of Makoto, Nanami, and Jinnai in their adventures that take places after the Original El Hazard OVAs and El Hazard OVA2.  It's an Excellent Addition and a must  buy!",947721600,5,229,4.846153846153846
