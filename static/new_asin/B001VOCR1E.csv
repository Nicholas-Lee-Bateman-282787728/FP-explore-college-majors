This documentary is an excellent look at the brutal absurdity of the current Belarusian regime.  The presentation is not only a synopsis of the protests following the March presidential elections which resulted in the ""reelection"" of Aleksandr Lukashenka, but also delves into the President's personality cult and the brutal tactics with which he has suppressed dissent in this country on the borders of Europe.  The segments where he praises then denies praising Hitler, and ""plays"" hockey while the opposing team actively avoids the puck are particularly ridiculous.  The footage of the protests is shocking, and includes videotaped beatings of not only protesters in March, but also of (and in a separate incident) Irina Zavadskaya, the wife of a journalist who ""disappeared"" around the turn of the decade.

Pros: An unflinching, riveting account of the ""last dictatorship of Europe"" that goes well above and beyond the titular events.
Cons: Sound quality not great, story not entirely linear.
Verdict: Highly recommended, I've viewed it multiple times myself and recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the region.",1245024000,5,1212,5.324607329842932
