5621529,5,B00BHNXH7M,"I have watched several 'heaven or hell' testimonies over the last few years  but these were people I had not previously heard.  I was impressed by the sincerity and credibility of the individuals involved, each having a similar but unique experience, some due to drug issues, health or accidents, or occult practices.  The bonus feature contained 3 additional testimonies as interviews.  Each testimony expressed the love of God and their personal encounter with Jesus Christ.  Several experienced hell, describing it as Bill Wiese (23 Questions on Hell) also described it, leaving no doubt that hell is a 'real place'.  After having watched the Lazarus Phenomena, To Hell and Back / Rawlings, Beyond the Grave 1 - all wonderful.  I also enjoyed the audio books by Capt Dale Black. Don Piper and Marv Besterman.  I am now looking to purchase this DVD, Life Beyond the Grave 2 in bulk, to pass around to others because it is so well done and uplifting.",1391385600,6,951,4.863354037267081

8568626,5,B00BHNXH7M,"This sequel to ""Life Beyond the Grave I"" is equally as good, if not even a little better, simply because, in addition to six testimonies of persons who clinically died, got a glimpse of where they had chosen to spend eternity, and were given a second chance here on earth to tell their stories, it also includes three live interviews.  I hope a Part III will eventually be made...",1401667200,7,380,4.507246376811594
