7911097,3,B00000IOKZ,"This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others.

In this particular DVD there are 3 episodes. The first is pretty ridiculous, and not that great. The 2nd is really funny. A plot to get Tenchi and Sakuya is in the works. The girls try to foil it and things get pretty entertaining. In the 3rd episode we get a major introduction to the new enemy. This is one of the more action packed episodes in the series. Tenchi and the girls are utterly defeated and realized that their bond is the only thing that will keep them all alive.

This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe.",1353024000,,1220,4.441964285714286
7911098,4,B00000IOKZ,"Yugi slowly builds her forces against Tenchi and the gang.  At first she tries to lure Ryo-Ohki away to the Moon, but fails.  Then she tries to use a clone of Tenchi's father to bring Tenchi and Sakuya together (which would break everybody else's heart).
Finally, Yugi steps into the ring directly, attacking Ryoko and blasting a lot of innocent trees.  But Hotsuma, a minion of Yugi's (who we met in the first DVD) pretends to save Ryoko before she and the others are totally defeated.
Where was Tenchi during all this?  On a date with Sakuya!
Is Yugi's plans working?  Will the friendships, the bonds of love, break up and allow Yugi to remove all of Tenchi's friends from the scene?  Will she trick Sasami to betray her friends or is she REALLY starting to like Sasami?",1087603200,,772,4.557971014492754

7911100,5,B00000IOKZ,Anything Tenchi just plain rules! I myself love every series. This sho was not as well animated at the other 2 (Universe and the OAVS) but is still  really good. I recomend this to people who don't just look for action. this  show is all about the charicters (it still has action tho) buy it!,965174400,2,292,4.290909090909091
