7799433,5,1584380675,"The DVD set entitled ""Papal Voyage to the Ecumenical Patriarchate,"" presents the historic meeting of Pope Benedict XVI and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in Istanbul, Turkey, at the end of 2006.  The event recalled the epochal meeting of Blessed Pope Paul VI and Ecumenical Patriarch Ath&eacute;nagoras I in 1964, which led to the mutual removals of the anathemas (excommunications) of 1054, which had rent Christendom.

The highlight of this set is the celebration of the Patriarchal Divine Liturgy, which included the Signing of the Common Declaration.  The Orthodox liturgy is stupendous; only the Extraordinary Form of the Mass of the Roman Rite, the ""Tridentine"" (Latin) Mass, can aesthetically compare to this liturgy.  The Orthodox are in the enviable position of not having the catastrophic liturgical changes wrought in the years following the Second Vatican Council, which so fatally compromised the Roman liturgy.

It is extraordinary moving when, during the Divine Liturgy preserved here, Pope Benedict recites the ""Pater noster,"" in Greek.

The Commemorative DVD also includes the Doxology of Thanksgiving on the Occasion of the Arrival of the Pope, as well as the Pre-Arrival Press Conference with members of their entourages, and the Tribute Banquet in honor of the Patriarch.

This marvelous presentation of the Order of St Andrew the Apostle, Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and Greek Orthodox Telecommunications is highly recommended to all.",1444780800,,1470,5.506666666666667
