I say 'little' here facetiously because far from 'little,' it was the Hamburg experience the forged the identity of The Beatles.

'Nowhere Boy' gives us Lennon at the apex of his youthful rebellion...and the accompanying angst related to his confusing maternal situation.  'Nowhere Boy' depicts mother Julia as flighty, unstable and incapable of the long-term commitment of motherhood.  She is, however, also creative, spirited, musical and unique.  Julia's sister, Mary ('Aunt Mimi'), is by contrast depicted as a stern disciplinarian and in it for the long haul.  In terms of her attitude to music, it's summed up by her famous line, ""The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.""  Mimi is, however, also shown to possess a sly but fierce intellect.  Director Sam Taylor-Wood shows some witty repartee and quick, punning wordplay between Kristin Scott Thomas' Mimi and Aaron Johnson's John.  The John Lennon the world came to know is equal parts these two maternal influences.

Director Taylor-Wood and designers Alice Normington, Kimberley Fahey and Barbara Herman-Skelding do a marvelous job re-creating Liverpool of the late fifties/early sixties.  This was an England still bobbing along in austere, post-World War II style.  The look of the film perfectly captures a grayer, tight-fisted, more cossetted nation...one that would indelibly change a few short years in the future, in no small part due to John and his bandmates. Contributing to the success of that look is young Mr. Johnson himself.  He is, at times, the spitting image of Lennon...especially when donning those NHS-issued specs.

This movie has some resonating pop culture influence as well: star Johnson and director Taylor-Wood - with 23 years in age difference - are engaged to be married.  Taylor-Wood gave birth to their daughter in July 2010.",1282867200,3,2373,5.56824512534819
4071101,1,B0035MA5HS,"I don't understand the tendency of film-makers, when making a bio of a rock-and-roller, it's necessary to always depict them as angry, brooding, sullen, tormented, angst-ridden, etc, etc., etc.
Hey, we all have our inner demons. We all have our bad hair days.
But read about John Lennon; look at actual film footage of the man at any point in his life. See him smiling, see his wit, see his charm.
There's a scene in this film where Lennon and his band (The primordial Beatles) are making their first recording; the homemade ""In Spite Of All The Danger"". If you just listen to the song, it's so obvious that everyone is having a ball of a time. In this scene, however, Lennon in shown scowling, intense, having the most trying time of his life. The whole movie is full of these ""at odds"" portrayals.
Past biopics did the same thing with Elvis. You look at old TV kinescopes of Presley. He's mugging, hopping all around, he's enjoying himself as much as anybody in the audience. But when some actor is playing him in a movie, Presley is seen as this oh-so-tortured soul. A Kurt Cobain of the '50s. It's just not a valid picture.
As someone who grew up in the beginning years of rock-and-roll, I assure you that it wasn't all about rebellion or anger. For most of us, it was all about fun, a way to express hopes and desires as well as, occasionally, frustration (usually sexual). And even the frustration stuff was usually expressed with a wink and exuberant yell.",1278806400,8,1463,4.566539923954372

4071103,4,B0035MA5HS,"I have asked Amazon to delete this review from the page of the film ""Which Way Home"" but they have done nothing about it so far, so please ignore it if you are on that page. This review is about another film, the early years of John Lennon.

""Nowhere boy"" is a quaint film about the early years of John Lennon, in post war Liverpool where he lived until the age of eighteen with his aunt Mimi, a strict and austere woman, the epitome of British propriety, who loved John but whose uptight personality prevented her from expressing this with tenderness or words of love.  The role of aunt Mimi is portrayed exceedingly well by Kristin Scott Thomas. Aaron Johnson is an impetuous, impulsive young Lennon whom we are introduced to as he is speeding past the streets of Liverpool, teasing the girls and taunting the boys.  He is excellent as the conflicted young man, living in an environment which he finds stifling, not giving him room and scope to express his potential.

John lives with his aunt as his father left when he was five and he is unaware of the whereabouts of his mother.  His aunt is disapproving of his rebellious and audacious character, being particularly exacerbated by his poor performance at school and the disrespect he shows towards his teachers.  She has also kept secret from him that her sister,  John's mother, lives only a mile away from his house. A friend takes him to his mother's where John is reacquainted with the woman he has not seen  since the age of five.  Julia, played by Ann Marie Duff, is a complete contrast to his reserved aunt Mimi.  She is emotional and totally unreserved, expressive in her love and devotion, flighty and erratic in her character.  She introduces John to Rock and Roll music, explaining that it expresses uninhibited sexuality.  In fact, her own attitude towards her teenage son is more that of a lover, with many sexual connotations and Freudian interpretations.

With his mother's encouragement, who takes John to cafes and dances rock to the jukebox sounds, John asks his aunt to buy him a guitar as he wants to start his own rock band.  Mimi reluctantly gives in to his demands, though she remains unaware of John's relationship with his mother.  Julia will instruct John how to play and sing, how to dance and what the latest hits are. Julia's husband does not approve of John's frequent visits which seem to affect his wife's taciturn moods.  She is prone to depression, so John's volatile personality may wear thin her already fragile state.

Aaron Johnson is wonderful in playing the impudent, mischievous, explosive character of a tempermental young Lennon but I believe that the two women are brilliant so they tend to slightly overshadow his performance.  The two sisters are a complete contrast, Thomas is superb as the stiff, unbending but deeply caring aunt, whereas  Duff is an eccentric, vulnerable type who goes through phases of isolation and outbursts of exuberance.  John feels torn in his love and loyalty between the two women who compete for his affection.  He feels lost, confused and betrayed, as he has been deprived of his father and for years of the affection of his mother. He suffers as he must decide where his loyalties lie, his aunt suggesting she deserves more for her devotion and years of dedication.  His behaviour becomes more and more delinquent, his consolation being the group he has started.  At seventeen he meets Paul McCartney and soon they become close friends, writing and performing their  own music.

Sam Taylor Wood gives a great portrayal of the somewhat oppressive atmosphere in post war England, with the omnipresent scarcity of money and availability of products, of the need to painstakingly save penny for penny to buy even the cheapest of guitars. What is not particularly memorable to me is the music, which I expected to play a more predominant role, though I was left with the impression that it was pleasant enough.  The film ends when John goes to Germany to give some performances there, making the rest history.  I was left with a bittersweet feeling at the end of the film, knowing that what followed was legendary fame and a tragically early death.",1268524800,54,4176,4.79608938547486

4071113,3,B0035MA5HS,"I finally got around to seeing this John Lennon Biopic. The beginning
gave me hope this would be a high quality accurate film, however it
soon lapsed into what I feared it would become: an overdramatized and
over the top take on John's relationship with Aunt Mimi and mother
Julia.

The film promoters promoted this as the ONLY film EVER to depict John's
childhood and the formation of the Beatles...I beg to differ. As a
Beatles' buff I've seen MANY other biopics, most of them hit and miss
like this one. I think the first part of the film was well done, and
accurate in depicting John's homelife, and how he got exposed to Elvis,
rock,  Paul and George.

My big qualm again is how they wrote in the fictional dialogue based
only loosely on the facts of John's family life. The dialogue soon
lapsed into overblown unbelievable high drama, when we know John was
MUCH less confrontational than that. So all that garbage with him
confronting Julia and Mimi is obviously total fiction (with a few true
facts thrown in for good measure).

It's unfortunate that they took that low road, since this had the
potential to be a quintessential John Biopic, and many aspects WERE
authentic, including wardrobe, location, and music. But they chose to
make it into a soap-opera-ish version that John himself would have
scoffed at. Overall worth seeing, but only if you skip over the high
drama segments.

Finally passing grades on the acting, however most of the characters don't really remind one of the actual people; i.e. if you didn't KNOW they were supposed to be who they were you wouldn't be able to easily guess.  I reluctantly have to call it exploitative.",1486166400,,1653,4.70242214532872

4071139,5,B0035MA5HS,"You think John Lennon was born a star? You think he lived a happy life?
Here is a story of his childhood suffering from his mother's exotic behavior abandoning him and he has to be raised by his mother's sister, couldn't stay at school as a good student and finally sees that he's got an eye on music, meets Paul Mcartney his everlasting friend and his the most one and only guy who truthfully understands him.
And then came along the George Harrison. Yes he all meet them at the High school. He might have suffered staying at school but he met some great guys that he spent the rest of his life with.

His true mother Mimi acted by Kristin Scott Thomas protected him from everything and raised him well that even after he became famouse, he called her every day, I mean every day till he died the very last day.
His mother on the other hand was a promiscuous prick even when she had a husband who was a soldier she constantly met new men hang around with them not taking care of John and when it came that she has to choose between John and her boyfriend she practically dumped him to her sister Mimi.
Mimi did everything to protect John from him going to an orphanage.
She spent her whole life taking care of him although for John she was an uptight woman always telling him do this and that that he thinks that he just want to go back to his mother who abandoned him because she looks so cool and free from everything.
But then again when the secret was revealed he found out how supid and horrible his true mother's face is, he was almost collapesed and that same day his real mother was hit by a car and died at the spot.
As we can see from this movie no true star or wonderful artist has a plain life or mundane childhood if you are yearning to be someone special and suffering from somthing and constantly think that why am I the only one who is suffering in this wonderful world of happiness think twice because this is the world to go to the so called greatness as an artist.
They all did suffered the same.
I am constantly having pain called migraine since 14 and it came to me like 300/365 a year and I think it's a sign for me to suffer as a future great artist and am happy for that.

The moment John meets Paul and George is a true magical moment and you will open your mind and eyes so big to see every detail and enjoy the movie so much.
The moment when John try to imitate another great star Elvis is just so great to watch at that time who did not?

And most of all John slowly figures out his own voice is the most delight.
First he follows other musicion's music and then he slowly begins to make his own music.
Mostly Paul composes songs and then John does too.

I never knew Paul has this Boy sopranoish voice so beautiful when he was about 16. He was gorgeously acted by Thomas Brodie-Sangster you know who the cuttest boy from <LOVE ACTUALLY> who lost his mother, or the bright boy from <NANNY MCPPHEE>.

And then there is also Kristin Scott Thomas actress of the century just being there makes this movie so shine. When she shout in front of John's mother acted by Anne-Marie Duff it was like roaring to the big storm just to say hey you do you think you can overcome my ship? I am the captain of this ship. You can never sink my ship as long as I am the captain you know? Goddammit!

And then there is of course Aaron Taylor-Johnson the John Lennod himself all the way. You can see him from the movie <KICK ASS> as kick ass himself.
You will love this film if you are Beatles' fan or not at all times.
This is a true classic and if you can bear for maybe first 40 minutes you will acheive something you cannot from any other film because the first half is kinda slow burn.",1475366400,,3698,4.179523141654979

4071161,5,B0035MA5HS,"I am a big Beatles fan but always had mixed feelings about John. He was obviously a great musician and showman. His Imagine album is wonderful, and his plea for peace in the title song is downright anthemic for the peace movement. He truly believed in love; his favorite lyric was ""All you need is love."" At the same time, for much of his life he was often nastily sarcastic, hotheaded, and abusive, especially when drinking. My understanding of his boyhood before I saw this film was that Lennon liked to exaggerate how difficult his situation had been, separated from his mother and raised by his Aunt Mimi, when in reality he had a very comfortable, secure, middle-class upbringing. I continued to hold this view throughout the film, thinking how good he had it: a reunion with a mother who was fun, doting, and indulgent while being watched over by a strict, but loving, aunt. That is, until the moment when Mimi revealed to him exactly the circumstances of the loss of his father and separation from his mother. Then I got it. And when he finally lost his mother for good, I can see why he described his growing up years as hard. I have much more sympathy for him now.",1464134400,6,1173,4.537735849056604

entertaining and well made film. I enjoyed it since first viewing it on U-Verse television.
The ""Lennon"" character is well done if less multi-dimensional and funny as the actual Mr. John Ono Winston Lennon.
A sort of ""alternate universe"" John Lennon, in my view.

4071199,4,B0035MA5HS,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this recreation of John Lennon's early teenage years. I did not know he had such a fraught and troubled upbringing. The script is excellent and it looks good except for the casting. Aaron Johnson is far too good looking to be convincing as John Lennon. There must be lines of young actors who could have done an equally good job (if not better) and been more convincing. Paul McCartney is also poorly cast by a very thin, though admittedly well-acted, actor, because he doesn't look enough like Paul. The two sisters are, needless to say, convincing and perfectly cast. For those who like 'true' stories, this is a must.

What I can't understand is how such a well researched movie can get two pivotal moments in John Lennon's life wrong;  John was in Scotland when his Uncle George died, not at home with him.
When his mother got hit by a car, John was at his mother's house on Blomfield Road, not at Paul's house.  And Julia was walking from Mimi's house.

4071257,5,B0035MA5HS,"Nowhere Boy is an outstanding and moving piece of art, the director Sam Taylor-Wood is a veteran and well accomplished artist so i wouldnt expect any less. The film doesnt play in the safe side, so don't expect to find here a detailed explanation of the beginning of Beatles and/or the wisdom of the older version of John Lenon.

The movie managed to immerse you in the vibe and look of the early 60s but I would say, at the end and even when the aesthetic of the movie is impressive, this is the story of a boy who seems to be lost into the ups and downs of his life and despite that he tried fiercely and with all his heart to keep going, to move on. You will ended up rooting for him independently if this is John Lenon or not.

The performances of the entire cast, several moments and scenes between Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Kristen Scott Thomas and Ann-Marie Duff are amazingly beautiful and moving. These two actresses are well known for giving us marvellous performances so having a young actor like Johnson matching their performances is something that has to be properly acknowledge and praise. He really transformed himself and pull off a truly moving performance (btw don't miss him in Anna Karenina as Count Vronsky)

During the entire movie there are moments of sadness and elation but also the echoes of possibilities since this is the beginning of someone that reached greatness even after or because of the emotional roller coaster he went through during his formative years and that somehow will leave you with hope and a melancholic smile once the movie is finished.

In conclusion you will find greatness in here.",1392595200,,1629,4.665505226480836

The filmmakers did say in the behind the scenes that Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney were present as consultants on the film to ensure that it did him justice.

Fifteen minutes in and my skin is crawling... but I soldiered through. You know, it's not a horrible movie - if you watch it as a movie. If you watch it as a true story about John Lennon's teenage years... well, you'll probably be scarred for life.

The fact that this almost incestuous feeling tale is based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Imagine-This-Growing-Up-with-My-Brother-John-Lennon/dp/0340839244/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Imagine This: Growing Up with My Brother John Lennon</a>&nbsp;makes matters worse. Julia's daughter saw this, this way? Ew, I hope not!

As for casting, I'm not a fan of the fact that 17 year old John looks 21 and 15 year old Paul looks pre-pubescent, but the actors are good enough to make me forget that oddity. And Paul DOES still have a baby face...

ON THE OTHER HAND... the story is entertaining, historical inaccuracies (and the ew factor) not withstanding. John's relationships with his mother and his aunt are a bit more glorified than most other accounts indicate - and I forgive the aunt aspect because he DID maintain a lifelong connection with her... but mom? The ladies aside, the movie works. The era feels right, the music - and John's almost imperceptibly changing taste - is perfect.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I really did like it - the second time I watched it. I just looked away when Mom started flirting with her son. Ew.",1372809600,4,1566,5.177865612648222

4071280,1,B0035MA5HS,"First, I really dig The Beatles!

That's what made me kind of curious to see NOWHERE BOY.

However, as the movie went on and on, I wished that I hadn't taken my time to have seen the movie. Although, The Beatles were just a little before my time, I always got the impression that John Lennon was a funny,sweet, sincere, sarcastic,reflective, poetic,gentle, conscious pacifist and an extremely gifted musician trying to use his gifts to better himself and the world around him in a positive manner.

In NOWHERE BOY, John Lennon has not evolved into the iconic artist that he will one day become. Here Lennon is rude, cocky but unsure, obnoxious, angst-filled,argumentative, and a young John Lennon had more emotional holes in him than a moth-eaten English wool sweater. ..And I get that! In this time-frame in Lennon's life, this all eventually leads him down the path to the inspired musical genius that he will one day become.

Me, personally, though? I'd rather not have known anything about how sadly tumultuous Lennon's younger days were. Some things are better left to the imagination or not to be known at all. Frankly, I really do like and I am totally fascinated with the older version of John Lennon who is at peace with himself and who makes it very publicly known that he is not at peace with the chaotic, unfair,corrupt,and greedy world around him.

Call me a sentimental sappy fool but that's how I kind of want to remember John Lennon,the man, not the NOWHERE BOY. I'll respectfully pass on this offering.....",1367107200,,1523,4.775665399239544

The film was a culmination of several biographies of Lennon, along with firsthand accounts from friends and family. Aaron Johnson was utterly fantastic as Lennon, giving a very strong performance. People were genuinely surprised when he was cast, being that he's not British, but it's not an issue. As for the film, in all honesty, until Lennon meets McCartney, the film is kind of slow. After that, it picks up a little bit, but jumps around quite a bit and gets to be rather confusing.

4071292,4,B0035MA5HS,"Crafting biography is a two-edged sword. Because of the subject of the movie, some people will pick it up and others will pick it apart, but it conveys a compelling story without straying far from the facts. John Lennon's early period is interesting, and the drama between his Aunt Mimi and mother Julia offers an appropriate plot thread. Though not as gritty as it could be, the film never stoops to being an idealized portrait. If you like Lennon only for ""Imagine,"" stay away and preserve your illusions, but if you want to go deeper, the film is a good introduction. Some may have difficulty accepting Johnson as John. Though no look-alike, the actor effectively captures the essence of his subject, ranging through unbridled rage, false bravado, self-amusing wit, sheepishness, and utter confusion, deftly translating the understated script. Likewise, Sangster does not resemble Paul, but completely nails the part without resorting to caricature--a longer film could have explored this important relationship more. Kristen Scott Thomas, as Mimi, knocks it out of the park, particularly when she is allowed to unwind in the second half of the movie. Much credit must go to director Taylor, as her picture was obviously a labor of love. Some viewers may be uneasy with the incestuous tone of Anne-Marie Duff's bipolar Julia, but that strained yet consuming John-Julia relationship is key to understanding John. Although the film captures some moments down to a fine point, the overarching theme forces some inaccuracies: Julia was in and out of John's life long before his mid-teens, the circumstances of how he ends up with Mimi were not so dramatic, and Cynthia Lennon is completely absent (Julia Baird's book serves as the film's basis). Some may see little more than a Lifetime original movie with a lot of cursing, but many will appreciate Nowhere Boy for what it is: one of the most lovingly and carefully painted film portraits of a musician ever made.",1358121600,,1963,5.0430769230769235

4071302,2,B0035MA5HS,"A meandering, plotless, formless script dooms valiant attempts by the actors to carve some real feeling from the iconic marble of John Lennon.  As per almost all Beatle bio-pics, melodrama and hysterics substitute for nuanced characterization and the audience is treated to one-dimensional situations and emotions.  Young Lennon (who had brown eyes, not blue, by the way; one of many questionable casting calls) has two moods in Nowhere Boy -- angry and very angry, broken only by interludes of psychotic larkiness or savage bullying. His rather staid middle-class upbringing  (compared to, say, Ringo's) is depicted as one continuing trauma after another.  Aunt Mimi, who also has basically two moods (stern and very stern) is Lennon's foil and chief tormentor.  Mother Julia (her two moods: giddy and very giddy) plays muse, temptress, and tease to an unsettling degree.  Paul McCartney (who unaccountably comes across as a munchkin of apparently 10 years of age)  is another sometimes crony, sometimes whipping boy.  You wonder why anyone ever put up with this Lennon lout, he is depicted here as so uncharming, unfunny, and brutal, with little of his latent talent manifest onscreen.

There is no Ringo, no Pete Best, no Stuart Sutcliffe, no Cynthia Powell Lennon, and barely any George, for those who are Fab-spotting.

Altogether drab and dull and unconvincing.  If I knew nothing about the Beatles before seeing this movie, Nowhere Boy would not inspire me to seek out any of their work, which is as harsh a condemnation I can imagine.",1338768000,3,1542,5.128
4071303,3,B0035MA5HS,"While I believe this film to be worthy viewing, there are aspects of it that annoy me. On the plus-side, the performances by Aaron Johnson as John Lennon and Kristin Scott Thomas as Aunt Mimi and Anne-Marie Duff as Julia were amazing. I felt the basic personalities were captured quite well, although I do not believe Aunt Mimi was as borderline abusive as this film makes her out to be. I also enjoyed the scene where John and Paul are singing in the enclosed front porch, which they actually did because the acoutics were so good. What bothered me most in the film were the little details: the home used as Mendips didn't look anything like the actual Mendips, John going in and out of the front door which he was not permitted to do (he always used the back door)and the portrayal of Paul McCartney by Thomas Brodie Sangster which was totally unbelievable. I was also annoyed by the continual insinuation that John was ""stolen"". The more-likely truth is that his mother (Julia), who had some emotional issues, behaved in ways not in the best interests of a child. Aunt Mimi stepped in and sacrificed a great deal to provide for John. I have read that he called her every week until he died and I do not believe he would have done that had she been abusive.  The essence of the film dealt with John's feelings of abandonment and how he became the wounded soul he was. In his younger years he was ill-prepared to deal with the complex details of his parent's problems and why he was better off living with his Uncle George and Aunt Mimi. My hope is that, before he died, John was able to reconcile the threads of his childhood. I would recommend viewing this film, but accept that a bit of license has been taken with the facts.",1336348800,3,1729,4.4715189873417724
4071304,4,B0035MA5HS,"This docudrama explores John Lennon's trajectory from his first harmonica playing and banjo picking as a rebellious teenager in Liverpool, to his departure for Hamburg with former Quarrymen bandmates Stuart Sutcliff, Paul McCartney and George Harrison. (Hamburg was where the Beatles forged their final group and refined their craft.)

Aaron Johnson (""Kickass"") is far too pretty to play John Lennon, but he captures the Liverpudlian accent and it's fun to watch him segue from a pair of Buddy Holly glasses (Holly was an early idol) to an Elvis hairdo, as he searches for a sexy persona. McCartney and Harrison are played by baby-faced Thomas Sangster (""Love, Actually"") and Sam Bell, respectively. By the way, you'll appreciate the captions on your DVD from Amazon.com because the accents can be a bit challenging.

The main thrust of this film is about Lennon's anger and confusion. He is raised by his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George, while his mother lives nearby with her new husband and two younger children. This has never been explained to him, and as we learn more, we realize this melodramatic tale HAS to be true, no self-respecting storyteller could get away with it.

Of course Beatles fans will, with the arrogance of 20/20 hindsight, smile at little things: Paul and John walk past a Strawberry Fields sign; Paul says they should write their own music to avoid royalty fees; John admits he only writes ""a little poetry.""

This also goes for other performers here as well. I don't think anyone could have portrayed the complicated childhood and tragic adolescence of John Lennon's life as well as it is portrayed here.

To me, pain is the great teacher. If you combine one's painful experience with the rich talent that was John Lennon, you get art of the highest order. All of the components, though, were important in making what became The Beatles: the necessary personality, skill and talent of the young Paul McCartney, the proficient guitar playing of 14 year old George Harrison, all of these elements were so integral in what became the biggest music phenomena of the last fifty years, perhaps, of the 20th century, itself. What excites me is that there are younger generations today who love John Lennon (and The Beatles) and now there's this brilliant film that bravely goes into the spirit of this complicated but marvelous talent.",1332633600,,1264,4.879069767441861

4071321,3,B0035MA5HS,"Here's and enjoyable, if a bit laborious, look at a teenage John Lennon and the early formation of a band known as the Beatles.  The film certainly focuses on Lennon at age 15.  His meeting with Paul McCartney and later George Harrison are just fringe elements.

Probably as important to the film are the two women in his life at this stage.  His mother Julia who abandon him, more or less at age 6, and her sister Mimi who effectively raised John along with his beloved Uncle George.  Julia had gone on to remarry and is raising 2 young daughters nearby.  She is wild, fun and a bit loony.  John appreciates this, especially after she helps him with his music.

Mimi is strict, formal and a bit of a stickler of British propriety.  We see some early details of the new band called ""The Quarry Men"" minus Ringo or even Pete Best as near as I can figure out.  The movie ends in 1960 as John and his mates head to Hamburg, Germany for their first big gig.  The rest is history.

4071322,5,B0035MA5HS,"What a difference time makes! ""Nowhere Boy"" (2010) shows that waiting is a good thing, that distance can produce a rich account of moments in the lives of famous people. This account covers approximately one year in the young life of John Lennon. It's a film to treasure, especially if you are or were a Beatles fan.

Frankly, I was one of those rabid Beatles fans back in the day as they amazingly popped on the scene, as if instantly made. But they weren't. It took time to make them right. This poignant and quick-paced film shows just how John Lennon became John Lennon and provides early glances into the making of the Beatles to come, or at least, the making of the first three: John, Paul, and George.

John had a mixed life with his guardians--his aunt and uncle, with whom--the uncle-- there was mutual adoration. His aunt, Mimi (played perfectly by Kristen Scott Thomas), was a proper Brit with a stiff upper lip and quite cold towards the two males. After his uncle died, John looked up his other aunt, Julia, the family black sheep, and found her warm and irresistible. Although fun-loving, Julia was emotionally unreliable. By happenstance, John learned that Julia was his mom and that Mimi had taken him in to prevent his father from taking him to New Zealand to live. It's a complication that terribly upset young John.

Julia'a major contribution to John's musical growth was teaching him to play the banjo. Then he moved to the guitar and declared he would start a band. He was very much an Elvis follower. This is not the story of a teen talking big and not doing, but of one who said and acted at once. A very appropriate statement made by Julia (whether true or fabricated in actuality) is this: ""You shouldn't want to be Elvis. You should want to be John Lennon!"" I chuckled at that!

One shocker for me, a Paul McCartney fan, is the depiction of Paul by a twerpy-looking actor (Thomas Brodie Sangster). I don't mean to insult young Thomas, but, really, Paul is so handsome. But then some people actually develop looks out of awkward, young teen years. The interesting aspect in the onscreen story is that Paul is the gifted musician with emotional and artistic depth. These gifts by the actor made him wear the role with aplomb and naturalness. On the other hand, John is the passionate leader.

There's much more to the story, making this definitely a must-see film, even if you are not particularly a Beatles' fan. This is a biographical account that unflinchingly shows the truth, both attractive and unattractive. Aaron Johnson (Lennon) is a young actor who will surely explode onto the screen again and again. He carries the film with grace and gall.

I loved ""Nowhere Boy!"" ""Nowhere""? A word directed by the head master toward young John because he wasn't exactly the most obedient student in his school.

4071326,5,B0035MA5HS,"This is the origin story of John Lennon's genius. As a teenager he was constantly in trouble; he had no interest in fitting in and playing by the rules. He wasn't like most other children anyway, growing up raised by his aunt and uncle as non-traditional parents. He lacked direction (despite the rigid upbringing from Aunt Mimi) and had no passion until he met his muse, his mother Julia. She was the non-conformist who teaches John that life isn't only about fitting in and doing what you're supposed to do. And she teaches him music; to play, appreciate and live music. I believe you know the rest.

I would never have thought of John Lennon as a renegade teen who cut his classes and idolized Elvis Presley. I had pictured him as the quiet, artsy poet. As it turns out, he was both. And that mix proved John to be revolutionary.

Aaron Johnson, most known to me as the titular character in the recent cult phenomenon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kick-Ass/dp/B002ZG9846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kick-Ass</a>, was fantastic as John Lennon. I thought he did a great job singing and playing guitar on film. I am surprised that he went after such a cheesy role as a graphic-novel, kid super hero after taking on a challenging role as one of the most iconic musicians the world has seen. Let's put Kick-Ass behind you, Aaron. You are made for bigger and better movies. Nowhere Boy proved that.

It is always hard to watch a movie that is a true story, or even based on a true story, when you want the situations you witness on screen to be amazingly true and not just amazingly scripted for the movie. To think of how certain chance meetings and passing conversations shaped a person is crazy. I am not normally a fan of ""biopics"" and I think that is because I do not get very star struck. But I think even I have a hard time down playing the influence of John Lennon and this one was very well done. That, and I think of this less as a ""biopic"" since this was not about John Lennon The Beatle, it was about an awkward teenager named John who learns to love music. I enjoyed this movie immensely and am already telling everyone I know that they have to see it.",1315872000,,2206,4.665809768637532

4071332,5,B0035MA5HS,"I recall reading somewhere that this would have been a good film even if the subject matter had not dwelt on the early years of John Lennon. I feel the same way - this movie stands up well even if the subject matter had been about any kid living down the block.

I've seen / read  countless interviews / books with many of John's boyhood friends i.e. the fellows who comprised his first band, The Quarrymen to think that the director / actor got it right re his incredibly forceful / dominant personality. I really believe that had John Lennon not acheived success in music, he would have been incredibly successful in whatever other endeavour he focussed on.

There's a scene in the film where John and Julia, his mother, are lunching in a cafe after having seen a newsreel clip of Elvis and John is struck by the screaming girls in the theater and their reaction to seeing Elvis on the big screen. Over a cup of tea later, John says to his mother ""God - why couldn't you have made me Elvis"".? And his mother responds ""because he was saving you for John Lennon"". Although John waves a fist in the air and says defiantly ""I'll get you for that God..!!!"", little did he know that in just a few short years, he / The Beatles would go on to surpass the frenzy that Elvis could conjure up.

Factually, I think the director / production people have to be commended for the meticulous attention to details / facts. The clothese / mannerisms / locations all give you a feel of what the mid to late 1950's Liverpool must have been like..!

The fellow, who played John's best mate, Pete Shotton, could be a twin for the real life Pete. Kristen Scott Thomas's performance as his Aunt Mimi couldn't have been better. The woman, who portrayed his mother, Julia, not only looked like her, but her personality was captured exactly as she was described by boyhood friends of John, who also knew Julia. I was particularily struck by the wonderful relationship, which John had with his Uncle George (Mimi's husband), who, unfortunately, passed away far too early. I know from many, many accounts that I've read that George had a beautiful relationship with John and that John loved him very, very much and was profoundly affected by his untimely death. It's true that John's father abandoned him at a very early age (5), however, George clearly was like a 'father"" to John. One can't help but speculate  how much of John's ""angst"" would have been diffused had George enjoyed a longer realtionship with John.

I was alittle disappointed that there was no reference / story involving Stu Sutcliffe, one of John's best friends, who played with the (Silver) Beatles when they were learning their craft in Hamburg. But it's a small complaint and in no way detracted rom the movie.

The influence of Paul on John, I thought, was portrayed very well by both the young actor / movie. Even at an early age, Paul was a ""diplomat"" and his ""calming"" influenece on John, on balance, was probably a very good tonic. One can only speculate as to the trouble that John could have gotten into had paul not been around to smooth things over with either John or the people he ""insulted"".

I thought the movie perfectly captured the mixture of anger / humour that was such an integral part of John Lennon's personality.  Yes -  John could be an angry individual with an explosive temper at times, but he was an incredibly witty / funny / humorous person as well. I recall seeing an interview once with his half-sister (also named Julia), who was a litle girl in the movie and Julia couldn't recall a single instance when John didn't have a smile on his face.

I thorougly enjoyed this movie about a boyhood hero of mine, whose music has been a constant companion of mine for almost half a century now. It's no easy task to depict somebody as complex a personality as John Lennon, but Nowhere Boy, in my opinion, succeeded..!

Highly recommended (and not just to John Lennon / Beatles fans).",1305676800,,3953,4.574257425742574
4071333,2,B0035MA5HS,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

According to John Lennon's cousin, Leila Harvey, during the time she knew him (when he was between the ages of 9 and 16), he was a ""happy-go-lucky, good-humored, easy going, lively lad."" But looking at 'Nowhere Boy', the film that is supposed to accurately chronicle the coming of age years of John Lennon, you would be more likely to get the impression that he was a troubled and angst-ridden adolescent who was hardly the ""happy-go-lucky"" kid who eventually became the co-leader of the greatest rock band of the 20th century. And that is the problem with 'Nowhere Boy'--it simply fails to answer why John Lennon was charismatic, even in his unformed early days.

He was charismatic because he WAS quick, witty, iconoclastic and wickedly humorous, all IN SPITE of his difficult childhood. He was the type of person, I believe, who never dwelt on the past and probably would have dismissed 'Nowhere Boy' as tendentious nonsense. A few months before his death, Lennon spoke about his upbringing and he praised his mother and all of his aunts. There is not a hint of anger or bitterness which ""Nowhere Boy"" implies consumed him while growing up: ""There were five women who were my family. Five strong, intelligent women. Five sisters. Those women were fantastic ... that was my first feminist education ... One happened to be my mother ... she just couldn't deal with life. She had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldn't cope with me, and when I was four-and-a-half, I ended up living with her elder sister ... the fact that I wasn't with my parents made me see that parents are not gods.""

Yoko Ono saw 'Nowhere Boy' twice and loved it. This is the same person who promoted ""Imagine"", the failed musical about John Lennon which put him up on a pedestal. 'Nowhere Boy' is a different kind of hagiography than the saintly John Lennon served up in the ""Imagine' musical. Both portraits can be likened to two different views of Christ-like figures: the saintly Lennon is like the wandering miracle maker dressed in a white robe, healing those afflicted with a malaise of the spirit; the ""Nowhere Boy' Lennon is one who undergoes a sort of spiritual crucifixion, enduring the slings and arrows of a torturous childhood and adolescence, emerging cleansed of all his trials and tribulations through a catharsis.

It's understandable that Yoko would hold on to both these idealized images of her slain husband. However, Paul McCartney, who actually remembers everything about growing up in Liverpool at that time, will have none of it. It's said that McCartney strongly objected to the scene where John punches him after his mother's funeral and asked Director Sam Taylor-Wood (who he supposedly was friends with) to take the scene out. Taylor-Wood refused and told him in substance, ""it's just a movie"". McCartney knows that Lennon would never have punched him because that would imply that Lennon allowed the bitterness of his upbringing to affect him. The film's scenarists would like us to believe that the climactic scene where he assaults McCartney, is where he exorcises his demons and achieves his catharsis (recall that he hugs McCartney afterward and apologizes). It's all cheap melodrama which never happened and the type of made up incident which Lennon would have also rejected had he been around to see the movie.

While 'Nowhere Boy' does a decent job of fleshing out the relationship between John's mother Julia and the aunt who raised him, Mimi, the more interesting story is the relationship John had with Paul as well as George and the peers he grew up with. All the key moments are covered in 'Nowhere Boy' including: the famous scene where John rides on the top of the bus, the first meeting with McCartney, the Quarrymen's first gig, a sexual encounter with a schoolmate, trouble at school, buying his first guitar--but it all seems like a glimpse at picture postcards. None of the relationships are developed, especially the most important one between Lennon and McCartney. And the real drama, of course, is not the dragged out familial problems, but how the Beatles actually came to be. To make that film, one would have had to have the rights to the Beatles catalog, a problem which the creators of 'Backbeat', the 1994 film about the Beatles Hamburg days, were also unable to overcome.

Perhaps the strongest aspect of 'Nowhere Boy' are the performances of Kristin Scott Thomas as Mimi and Anne-Marie Duff as Julia. Thomas is thoroughly convincing as the 'tough love' substitute parent playing opposite the troubled Bohemian of sorts, Julia. You can see how both women influenced Lennon's personality--he inherited Mimi's discipline and Julia's creativity and rebelliousness. Aaron Johnson manages to capture little of Lennon's great wit and humor, but is saddled by the ponderous script. The make-up department should be commended for making Johnson look like Lennon, especially once he adopts Elvis's pompadour. Thomas Brodie-Sangster takes a shot at Paul but doesn't look enough like the 'handsome' Beatle to be convincing. The actor who plays George looks nothing at all like him and the part is woefully underdeveloped.

We're informed by a prominent Beatles historian that 'Nowhere Boy' is the first film that covers John Lennon's early years including his upbringing and creation of the Beatles. While it does cover most of the bases, and does a decent job of defining the characters of Lennon's mother and aunt, Lennon himself comes off as a bit pathetic. Putting it another way--he's a character that all the joy has been sucked out of -and his angst-ridden replacement seems far from the flesh and blood rock icon, revered by millions.",1305504000,6,5731,4.944963655244029
4071334,4,B0035MA5HS,"John Lennon's life has been the subject of documentaries and novels and art shows, but few have been as successful at fleshing out the human being John Lennon who was to become a legend in his time as well as this film, NOWHERE BOY, apparently based on a memoir by his sister Julia Baird and crafted for the screen by Matt Greenhalgh, and directed with great understanding by Sam Taylor-Wood. It is as much a story of bruised families as it is an introduction to the forces behind Lennon's formation of what was to become The Beatles, probably the most influential musical group of the 1960s and 1970s who all but defined that period in our history.

John Lennon (Aaron Johnson) lives with his stern guardian aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas) and beloved uncle George (David Threlfall) in Liverpool.  At film's beginning Uncle George die suddenly and at the funeral John sees his biologic mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff) who deserted John when he was 5 years old only to marry and have two daughters living not far form her sister Mimi.  John seeks out Mimi, discovers she is a freewheeling music buff who is not only glad to re-connect with her son but also finds him physically attractive.  Mimi's common-law husband Bobby (David Morrissey) finds John's intrusion into his family (the two have two daughters) disturbing.  But as John becomes more fascinated with being with his birth mother he learns banjo and guitar and gets the urge to imitate Elvis Presley - an infatuation that leads the 15-year-old John to form a band called Quarrymen, soon joined by Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and George Harrison (Sam Bell).  The group becomes locally successful but John's attention to Mimi proves problematic and Julia and Mimi spar for John's attention and love.  How John Lennon rises above his roots and retains love for both 'mothers' provides a touching ending to a movie and an apropos beginning to understanding  the success of the Beatles.

Aaron Johnson captures the personality formation of john Lennon as well as any actor to date and his performance is excellent.  He is equally matched by the polished performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Anne-Marie Duff. NOWHERE BOY is an entertaining and nostalgic film well worth watching.

This movie is fairly good, somewhat accurate and the acting overall was first rate {particularly Kristin Scott-Thomas}. I can't say it's any better or more entertaining then others I have seen.

4071337,3,B0035MA5HS,"I found myself trying to like this film but not quite managing it. Part of the problem for me is: John Lennon was one of the most charismatic human beings I have ever run across in the public sphere. Friends and acquaintances confirm that even as a teen, Lennon was the one who drew everyone's attention in any given room. He was the one you couldn't keep your eyes off. Try BEING such a person for the silver screen. That's a tall order for a young actor, Aaron Johnson in this case, to pull off. And I don't believe he does pull it off. Read a biography of John Lennon or the Beatles, and in one's imagination it all seems so magical. Stick a bunch of teens trying to impersonate them in front of a movie camera and suddenly it all seems so mundane. Inwardly I was cheering on the actors, wanting them to make Lennon's youth come alive, but it didn't happen. I just saw a bunch of young actors pretending they were the Quarry Men. Ho-hum. Perhaps it's that we baby boomers are so familiar with the real-like charisma of Lennon in his 20s and 30s that we expect to see it all in some incipient form even in a young actor playing him. It may be unrealistic on our part. Nonetheless...

Dramatic license revoked: It's a post-funeral house-gathering. Paul makes some innocuous remark about John's late mother. John takes it the wrong way, and publically head-butts Paul. The two then dissolve in tears (and Paul's blood) in each others' arms, in recognition of each's maternal loss. This may go over well with viewers unaware that no such thing ever happened. I just bristled. As if the story of John Lennon and the Beatles is so lacking in drama that it has to be contrived.

And what of the climactic scene of the QuarryMen recording `In Spite of the Danger'? One: It's  a rather lame folkie-sounding song to spotlight. Two: It was a one-off Paul and George composition, with no Lennon content. Very deflating for those with some knowledge of John's life.

Something else that bothered me was the whole insistence on telling this `origins' story for the umpteenth time. I've always felt strongly, as did Lennon, that ""the music is the thing"" when it comes to the Beatles. In fact, the proto-Beatles didn't make much music worth more than a listen or two during their pre-Ringo era of 1957-1962. It was a necessary stage in their development, obviously, but music-wise it's strictly an archeological dig. Their real heyday begins in late 1962 and extends to at least early 1970. I say `at least' because by 1970 the Beatles had become each Beatle going solo and continuing to make great music--if only sporadically. This incredibly rich and fascinating stage--easily re-imagined as the Beatles' final glorious era--somehow has been demoted and even forced to play second banana to the peripherals of the 1960s such as the Yellow Submarine movie or the Anthology sets that even Paul joked were mostly toxic waste. Instead, why not take the very best of John, Paul, George and Ringo, arrange it in Beatles format--surely as nature intended--and let `the Beatles' carry on in the more conceptual form the group had often assumed when only one or two Beatles participated on a given track (`Yesterday', `Julia', `Love You To' and so forth).",1300924800,,3235,4.700176366843033

4071340,4,B0035MA5HS,"My expectations for this movie were extremely low.  The only reason for this is, as a lifelong Lennon fan, I have been extremely disappointed by every other portrayal of him in various other movies over the years.

I am not one of those fans that over identifies with celebrities/artists that I really like, and feel as if I know them personally.  Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that other portrayals of John Lennon were not even remotely accurate.

While I think Aaron Johnson comes closer to the mark in portraying the ""spirit"" of a young John Lennon, I don't really know how accurate his portrayal is either.  However, the reason this movie worked so well for me is that, ultimately, I pretty much forgot that this was a film about John Lennon and really just got into the story itself- It's just a darn good movie.

The part that fascinated me was the dynamics of the very unique relationship between John and his mother.  This was really the heart of the movie, rather than the more biographical apects pertaining to the formation of the Quarry Men/early Beatles.

That said, I also think the movie touched on very well the budding partnership between John and Paul and the subtle dynamics going on between these two virtual opposites.  I liked the way Paul was shown to be somewhat in awe of John while simultaneously acting as something of an early mentor to him.

A final testimony to what a good movie this is that you do not need to be a fan of John Lennon or the Beatles to enjoy it.  I virtually forced my wife (who for some odd reason really dislikes John Lennon) to watch it.  She admitted afterwards that she really liked it!

4071341,4,B0035MA5HS,"My wife, a huge Beatle fan, sat down to watch this movie, and I joined her with no real plans of getting hooked. I expected a mockumentary, a retread of facts about Beatlemania. Instead, ""Nowhere Boy"" is a heartfelt tale of a troubled British teenager. He lives with his aunt and uncle, but when the uncle dies, young John is sent into a tailspin.

To no one's surprise, John finds refuge in music. Along the way, though, he seeks answers about his past and his parents. He rekindles a relationship with his mother, acted to great effect by Anne-Marie Duff. She is fun, lively, and a kindred spirit. But she is also irresponsible and temperamental, a fact John's aunt, played with equal skill by Kristin Scott Thomas, never lets him forget. Even as the music is awakened in him, he struggles with school, girls, and insecurity that masquerades as braggadocio and arrogance. Underneath it all he is floundering to understand his place.

""Nowhere Boy"" doesn't revel in the posh or noble airs that predominate most British films, but shows British teens as rebellious, lecherous, and foul-mouthed--all the things I experienced while living in England. It is rated ""R"" for a few such scenes. Despite tragedy and conflict, John Lennon meets a friend along the way, young Paul, and they become the pillars of a band that would change history.

This is a beautifully shot and acted film. Although the actors don't really look like the actual John or Paul, they bring their own vibe to it and pull it off with great skill. This is not a documentary on the Beatles. In fact, it could almost be a story about an average British teen who wants to understand his family and his future.

4071345,3,B0035MA5HS,"When I watched this movie, I felt that director Sam Taylor-Wood was looking at John Lennon's life through the lens of nostalgia.  Instead of the gray, hardscrabble England that was purveyed in British cinema in the 1950's in memorable, tough movies like ""The Sweet Life"", ""Look Back in Anger"", and ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"", we get a surprisingly bright and green Liverpool and a somewhat sweetened piece of biography.

Aaron Johnson, the actor playing Lennon, actually looks more like Pete Best (the original Beatles drummer), with his baby blue eyes and ducktail haircut.  When Johnson dons wire-rimmed glasses, he resembles Harry Potter.  And wait 'til you meet Paul and George.  You won't believe how fresh-faced and scrubbed behind the ears the actors portraying them look, as if they were twelve years old.

It's not only Lennon's chums who are dressed up.  In this film version, Aunt Mimi (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and Lennon's mother Julia (Anne- Marie Duff) are nothing short of hot-looking ""dishes"".  Duff seizes her opportunity and plays the vivacious Julia to the hilt, but when you see actual photos of the real Julia, you note that she wasn't so glamorous.  Neither was Mimi, and though Scott-Thomas plays her primly, you still know that there is a svelte body beneath the prim facade.

Lennon's personal characteristics are paraded in an obvious fashion, too.  John was a ""dreamer"", so we get shots of him dallying on his back in a field.  He was creative, so we see him goofing off in school, working on his rhymes and cartoons.

This is still a nice film for Beatles fans.  Just be aware that the film isn't about the music, or really so much about Lennon, as it is about the rivalry and jealousy between his mother and his aunt.",1299196800,4,1753,4.858585858585859
4071346,5,B0035MA5HS,"I went into Nowhere Boy being a little worried. I had heard things about terrible acting, factual inaccuracies, the young man playing Lennon only got the part because he was dating the director or some such nonsense. I watched the film and was extremely surprised. Being a bit of an amateur Beatles historian myself, I already knew the stories about how Fred (Alf) Lennon and Julia had split up and John had gone to live with his Aunt Mimi. One MUST do a little more digging to find Lennon's own accounts of how when he and Julia would take naps together he often wondered how she would react if he put his hand on her breast or how Fred and Julia left it up to John whom he would go to live with (which broke his heart and left him extremely bitter) or how Paul was constantly having to reel John in to keep him from being ""a dick"".

I read a review earlier somewhere that said this movie was terrible because it left one believing that John was sour and brooding when if you just watch the old news clips you would see that he was smiling and happy. Showmanship can cover a multitude of feelings is all I can say about that.

Watch this movie, and then if you are so inclined watch Backbeat (another really good Beatles film that admittedly falls short on the facts, but is close enough for it to give you the basics). These two together take you from about 1956 to about 1962 in the Beatles timeline.

Are you a fan of The Beatles? If so, then you may want to check out Nowhere Boy (2009). While it's NOT the story of how The Beatles got started, it IS the coming-of-age story of how John Lennon got started in life and music, including how he met Paul McCartney and created his first rock band, The Quarrymen. Nowhere Boy is a very well made British indie film by first time feature film director Sam Taylor-Wood. It was released on Blu-ray and DVD recently and I've been anxiously awaiting it ever since I first saw the trailer. The film barely got a theatrical release here in the U.S., but I think it will find its audience at home instead. This is a character-driven dramatic story that works very well at portraying the early roots of John Lennon, who like so many artistic geniuses, came from a broken, dysfunctional family, where he was pushed and pulled by the influential members of his family. Would Lennon have ever gotten into music if it hadn't been for his birth mother? Or the conflict between his mother and his aunt (who was the woman that raised him)? Questions like these seem easy to answer in hindsight, but Nowhere Boy takes us through the journey of Lennon finding his voice in his teens.

While I enjoy some of The Beatles music, I've never been overly enamored with the the band or the stories of its members, like many obsessive fans. But Nowhere Boy's trailer somehow got its hook into me and now I'm very glad that it did. Front and center in the film is actor Aaron Johnson, who depicts John Lennon brilliantly. While he doesn't necessarily look like John Lennon, he embodies the energy and moody emotion of the musician as perfectly as I can imagine an actor could. Not only does Johnson provide us with juicy dialogue in his native British accent, he even takes on singing and playing the guitar quite well. Without a genuine portrayal of the music in this movie by the actors, I have a feeling the film would fall flat on its face and feel more like a made-for-television documentary. It was the music that helped tie the pieces of the story together and keep me engaged and interested. Clearly Johnson is a talented young artist who should have an interesting career in the entertainment industry for years to come. I've gotten the soundtrack to the film since watching Nowhere Boy and the re-creations of Lennon's early music by ""The Nowhere Boys"" is quite good for a group of actors, all on its own separate from its film.

Nowhere Boy is a beautifully shot film with excellent cinematography by Director of Photography Seamus McGarvey, also known for his work on Atonement (2007). Some of the images of the U.K. are simply incredible, showcasing the beauty hidden within the details of that country, as well as the details of this production (i.e. the actors, the costumes, and the sets). The production design by Alice Normington and her incredible team in the art department gives the film a perfect look and feel that helps tell this story set in the 1950s. Much like The King's Speech (2010), God is in all the details of this film, including the excellent dialogue and emotional body language written by screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh and portrayed by the incredible cast. Kristin Scott Thomas and the rest of the supporting actors were perfectly cast and help make the film as good as it is.

In terms of graphic design, I really love the movie poster for this film. Sometimes just a well-designed movie poster can get me enticed to see a film, and this poster definitely got me to see the trailer the first time, which then got me to see the film. I just love that image of actor Aaron  Johnson as John Lennon with those thick black horn-rimmed glasses, a cigarette poking out of his mouth, and his guitar around his shoulder. Along with the colors and textures in the poster, it's one of my favorites from 2010.

If you're looking for a good solid movie set in the past with interesting history into the character development of a man and a musician like John Lennon, Nowhere Boy is a new release definitely worth seeing. While I'm not sure how many repeat viewings this film will get in the future from me, my first viewing was enjoyable and well worth the time. The Blu-ray presentation is definitely the way to go here since the colors and details in the photography need the higher definition format to really sing.",1298332800,,4393,4.611253196930947
4071352,4,B0035MA5HS,"I have loved the Beatles since I was 13, and I'm usually very critical of Beatle movies. But I thought this one was amazing. Don't pay attention to bad reviews. First of all, this is NOT a movie about the Beatles, it's a movie about John Lennon, so all the complaints about not seeing more of the Beatles are rather silly.

I thought the film succeeded brilliantly in showing the paradoxical essence of John Lennon - a gentleman and a jerk, an intellectual and a hooligan, sometimes mature other times childish. The direction was subtle and wistful. The cast was fantastic. Aaron Johnson amazed me. I could not believe I was watching the same person I saw in Kick-Ass. He may not look like John, but for 98 minutes of the film's duration, he IS John. From the first cheeky ""Is nowhere full of geniuses, sir?"", I saw and heard John Lennon. Toward the end, when Mimi asks him about his new band's name, for a second or two his expression is so quintessentially John that it sent shivers down my spine. And people are actually complaining about the lack of physical resemblance? Really? I find it ironic that these same people raved about ""Aviator"" but seemed to have no problem with DiCaprio looking nothing like Howard Hughes. It's one thing to resemble someone physically, but to get so completely into the character that looks become irrelevant... That takes major talent.

I have a feeling many people who complain about John's portrayal in this movie don't seem to realize that the public image of John Lennon was just a veneer. Being all but abandoned by his parents and living with a stern, cold (albeit loving, in her own way) woman with basically no male role model - no young boy can go through that and come out all right. Under Lennon's witty, sarcastic clown front lived a troubled, confused, tortured soul. All you have to do to realize this is look at what happened after the Beatles had broken up - this soul came out full force and nearly destroyed him.

I do have to admit that the movie isn't flawless: some parts are fiction, such as John being completely estranged from his mom. The real John did have a relationship with her all throughout his childhood. I also wish they'd mentioned Cynthia, who was a big part of John's life, but I have a feeling Yoko Ono had a little something to do with that... Other than that, it was hands down a winner for me. 4,5 stars.",1298246400,2,2382,4.547785547785548

4071354,4,B0035MA5HS,"NOWHERE BOY is a pleasant, often rambling, look at the teen years of John Lennon.  It's the short time frame between Lennon being a prankish, low-level vandal and troubled schoolboy who readily captures the interest of the young ladies and his explosion onto the rock scene as a founder of The Beatles.

When the movie begins, Lennon (Aaron Johnson) is living with his aunt Mimi (Kristen Scott Thomas) and Uncle George.  His uncle has given him a love of music, radio and generally acting silly.  His aunt tries earnestly to instill him with discipline and to put to good use young John's restless energy and undeniable charisma.  She clearly loves John (and vice-versa), but theirs is a relationship fraught with tension, because John yearns for his real mother, Julia.  After his uncle dies, John's desire to ""get out of the house"" grows by leaps when he discovers his mother lives very near him.  He begins to hang out with Julia (Anne-Marie Duff).  Julia has a new husband and some young kids of her own, yet she too is compelled to hang out with her son.  Julia, who ranges between being a ""free spirit"" to ""slightly crazy"", seems to have an almost sexual attraction her son.  Nothing happens, but there are plenty of vaguely uncomfortable scenes, where she acts more like a teenybopper girlfriend than his mother.  John is eager to spend the time with her, but is also uncomfortable with the kind of attention he gets.  And he's not comfortable with the kind of attention the strict Aunt Mimi gives him either.

Music becomes a refuge, and he puts together a band (playing the guitar his aunt was foresightful enough to get him, despite knowing nothing about guitars or modern music).  John enjoys this hobby, which becomes more serious, until eventually he meets up with much younger Paul McCartney.

Things come to a head between the two sisters and the movie takes many emotional turns, jolting the impressionable Lennon from one feeling to another.  He's not exactly a ""tortured soul"", but we sure do feel compassion for this bright but angry kid when life deals him so many hard blows.

The movie ends just as Lennon and his new group head off to Hamburg.  As viewers, we know superstardom lies just around the corner, but the film mostly has a bittersweet tone to it.  It could just as easily have been a fictional story about a young kid from Liverpool who comes to rough peace with the hard knocks of his life, and starts a solid career playing early rock `n' roll.  We know it's about John Lennon, but because no music from The Beatles is featured (and none of the last names of the other Beatles are even used), it feels slightly removed from feeling like a biography.  This is both good and bad.  It's bad, because the movie feels a little coy about avoiding The Beatles (I assume this was for licensing reasons), to the point where you can't help but notice.  But it's good, because this is a story about a youth becoming a young man...not ""the kid who would be John Lennon.""

It's modest all around, but has nice art direction and costuming, capturing the times quite well.  The best things in the movie are the 3 lead performances.  Duff is sparkling and giddy and a little dangerous as Julia.  We feel bad for her, and we resent the bad things she does.  Thomas, who is always excellent, gives a restrained performance as the uptight aunt who has a deep love for her nephew that comes through in anguished little bursts and glints of pride in the eyes.  It's low-key work, but very effective.  And Aaron Johnson, whom I really came to like as the star of KICK-A*S, shows that he's very likely to be a force to be reckoned with in years to come.  Handsome, sensitive, smart and funny.  His Lennon feels like it could be the John Lennon we ""knew"" during the heyday of the Beatles...but the performance has depth and feeling that go far beyond ""imitation.""

It's a solid film that won't exactly shake you to the core or make you think of The Beatles in a new way.  But it offers many pleasures that anyone who loves film should appreciate, frankly even if you're NOT a Beatles fan (if such exists).",1298073600,,4116,4.600823045267489
4071355,2,B0035MA5HS,"This film could be summarized as follows: clean-cut, bland Liverpool teenager with no discernible wit or musical interest and not a caustic  bone in his body encounters adversity in those who parent him and suddenly is turned into John Lennon. We are to believe that lacking any interest in music of his own, he is turned on to it by his ""aunt"" Julia (who is of course in reality his mother); and because of the death of his uncle and later of Julia, he changes personalities and becomes a wholly different character. Those of us who know and love Lennon feel sure that he was always Lennon, from a young age, was always original, funny, impish, smart, cruelly perceptive of others, verbally gifted, sensitive, and artistic. Of COURSE his teenage experiences intensified him and to some extent forged his artistic identity, but the guy we see at the start of this film could never turn into John Lennon. To make matters worse, the actor who plays Lennon does not in any way physically resemble him, nor does he even talk like him. Couldn't they at least get the accent right? Then there's McCartney. This casting is even worse. A smallish, sallow-looking kid with no eyelids and none of Paul's presence, charisma, or striking facial beauty is made to stand in for him. As a fiction about mother confusion this film isn't bad, but as having anything to do with Lennon, McCartney, or the real story behind the Beatles, it is a travesty.",1297814400,11,1434,4.690476190476191
4071356,5,B0035MA5HS,"Out of all four Beatles John Lennon is perhaps the most romanticized and celebrated of them all. And it doesn't have as much to do with his death as it does his life. The public shared in his trials and tribulations from the Beatle era onward but all the same there was a side of Lennon that only he really fully knew. And this movie deals with this period of his life. It's a period that was explored some years ago in a similarly themed TV movie that actually spilled over into the Beatle era and his family life with Cynthia and son Julian. This movie however focuses right in on the earliest part of his life,from his mid teens days all the way up through his first journey to Hamburg with Paul McCartney and George Harrison and that is the note on which the film concludes. However what's in between says a lot about not only the music he created but his entire adult personality.

  We start with John Winston Lennon as a teenager living with his Aunt Mimmie when his uncle suddenly dies and from there on we deal with the trauma's and occasional joys of this man. In the beginning we're not confronted with merely another frusterated artist trying to break out but with a fairly average,directionless teen with a very troubled past and psyce. John journey's with a friend to Blackpool in an attempt to reconnect with his mother Julia whom he finds now has another family at that time. It goes on this way with the story of John being tugged at between two sisters:there's Mimi with her inherantly loving but strict and unyielding tastes and Julia,who herself is a basically as loving to John as her sister but doesn't possess a strong enough sense of inner responsibility to be much of a parent in the long run. We also learn why this living situation exists;as small boy John had been literally asked to chose between living with either his two flighty and free spirited mother or absenty father before Mimi decides to take John in to raise him herself to prevent him from winding up a ward of the state.

  Young John finds himself drawn to music with his mothers interest in rock n roll and her teaching him how to play the guitar. We then follow on with what is now part of Lennon/Beatle lore:his beginnings in the local skiffle group The Quarreymen,his first meeting with Paul McCartney and George Harrison and before we know it John's family situation is abruptly put to a close when his mom Julia is killed in a car accident. Interestingly this occurance led to a brotherly closeness between John and Paul,whose mother had died herself only his Paul's case of cancer. Lennon's music tends to be the more reflective,personal and pained songs in the Beatles catalog and in many cases some of the most beloved. And with this wonderfully directed and acted film one is given a close view into the world from which Lennon embarked from into becomming one of the major cultural and musical icons of his generation. It doesn't idealize Lennon or indulge in any huge theatrics in any way;it just presents his youth as it was and in many ways breaks down a lot of the adulation that John Lennon had to deal with throughout his life and even after his death.",1297728000,,3162,4.548330404217926

4071358,5,B0035MA5HS,"This was a very good film, up until now we have had little films that delved into the story of John Lennon's Teen years, Backbeat captured much of the early interactions and relationships, but that story was mostly about stu sutcliffe and his relationship with the others.

The thing that i found intriguing in this film is the relationships that he had not only with those around him but himself. The inner turmoil of being torn ways, trying to be accepted, or loved, or not knowing love based on his perception of it. I loved the intimate moments, reaquaintance with his mother (as creepy as it may have seemed at times), John sitting playing ""hello little girl"" for paul, the relationship he had with his uncle shortly before his passing, and his relationship with a stern aunt, that might have helped shape him in some of his rebellious natures. Of course most of us beatles fans, or lennon fans for that matter, really know the history before this film, but in the documentary sense of the word, it was great to see it actually realized on film.

Aaron Johnson, did a great job at exploiting the pain and rebellion, but also the charming sensibilities of John Lennon. It is extremely hard to find someone that evokes the look of john lennon, and although Johnson does not look a thing like lennon, i feel that he scored bigger than someone that might have looked the part but could not play it. After watching the film and discovering that he sang the songs as well, i was even more impressed with his performance.

this film essentially is not about the beatles... this is about John Lennon, Mimi, and Julia, the rest of the cast is second based, although it shows a close relationship that paul and john had at the beginning... as said in<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beatles-Anthology/dp/0811836363/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beatles Anthology</a>companion ""There were five women that were my family. Five strong, intelligent, beautiful women, five sisters. One happened to be my  mother. She was the youngest and she couldn't cope with me and I ended up living with her elder sister"" That sums things up, as to what you will see and feel in this film. A love for a mother that was never truly there for John, that essesentially gave him up... Twice. An Aunt, that must now raise John on her own due to the death of Johns uncle, and is strict but in a nurturing way, thinking she knows what is best for John.

One of the main things i want to point out, is this is not a revelation of tragedy in lennons life... there is no mention of his death, it is a celebration of his life, and determination that brought us to the now. it is his experiences that might have and did alter or change his life forever, and most of ours as well, this is the transition of Nowhere Boy, to Nowhere Man... and no matter what, there is a nowhere better place to be.",1297209600,3,2902,4.693516699410609
4071359,5,B0035MA5HS,"After the disbanding of one of the most legendary rock `n' roll bands The Beatles, each individual member parted their separate ways and established successful solo musical paths.  But with that departure, their legacy would only grow to an enormous effect that they had never imagined with various interpretations that simply translated into a lasting legacy in the form of tributes and the retelling of the band and its individual member's personal histories through autobiographies and biographies through literature, film, and most of all the music which speaks for itself.  And once in a while a movie comes along that attempts to retell the story of The Beatles, Nowhere Boy, is one of those films.

With meticulous detail and creative interest of depicting John Lennon's life before The Beatles, Director Sam Taylor-Wood exceptionally makes the attempt with meticulous detail and creativity of taking viewers back to 1955 in Liverpool where John (Aaron Johnson) at the age of 15 experiences the spurts of sullen maturation of a confused schoolboy due to the fractured relationship between he and his Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas) and long lost mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff).  With the confusion that comes along with adolescence, John finds a way to distant and rest his qualms through his teddy boy appearance, poetry, and the discovery of a new form of music called rock `n' roll.  And there is no denying that the sights and sounds of the decade are beautifully woven within this film that closely recreates the time period with the clothes and the first guitar that John Lennon purchased with Mimi and later had the instrument re-bought by Julia after Mimi became a little irritated and sold it back to the shop; one can see the somewhat tug of war that John had to endure between the two women that would eventually be reconciled but later result with tragedy.  But beyond the dysfunctional elements, the music and the formation of The Quarrymen and the first meeting of a very boyish looking Paul McCartney (Thomas Brodie Sangster) and George Harrison (Sam Bell), it would be match made in heaven or where the history of The Beatles begins.

Nowhere Boy is a fascinating film biography of John Lennon's personal rite of passage to maturity to music that may interest most die-hard Beatles fans or any one who may want to delve deeper before 1964.  Indeed, Taylor-Wood captures the mood and the music that was John Lennon through the images and influences that breathes throughout the film.",1296950400,3,2506,4.9928057553956835

4071361,5,B0035MA5HS,"I didn't think I would like this film and, at times, it was hard to watch.

We all know how it ultimately ends, with John Lennon being shot by a crazed fan, the poet singer that was the voice of a generation suddenly extinguished.  A sad symbol of ""what never was or would be again"" to tens of millions of Baby Boomers who danced, laughed, and listed intently to the music of The Beatles.

For me, that gave me pause to watch the film but was still drawn to taking a glimpse of this superstar's teen years.  What I got was more than I could have ever expected.

His Aunt Mimi is hard to like - she's cold, distant, and has an emotional wall up around her that would make the Great Wall of China seem pale in comparison.  She is an unlovable character but, for a boy like John, the symbol of the Prison Guard who sets boundaries on his wild, adventurous character.

After his beloved Uncle dies suddenly (and who was the also the warm loving friend that John had while living in Mimi's household), he catches a glimpse of a woman at the funeral who he later finds out is his real mother.  Sadly, he comes to find out that she lives within walking distance from him complete with a new family yet never reached out to him.

She is obviously not ""all there"" and is a childish, immature woman who is more like John and his teenage friends versus a mature, functional adult.  She is unrestricted, the Child Ego Incarnate who only thinks of her own gratification, never considering the affect she had on her abandoned son.

At first, everything goes well after being reunited with his real mother who introduces him to Rock 'N Roll and teaches him music on a banjo while staying at her home.

As John forms his band, I was surprised to see the rest of the legendary Beatles members show up - Paul McCartney and George Harrison.  Personally, I was surprised to realize that they went back that far and, knowing so now, it made me appreciate them so much more.

As time goes by, though, strain begins to form and cracks appear.

The rage at being abandoned by his mother, Mimi's repressive behavior, and being haunted by dreams he doesn't understand begin to take their toll on John as the angst of teenage years begins to set in and, finally, the truth behind his abandonment, including the answers to the dreams that have plagued him since he was a child.

Mimi suddenly becomes more lovable after this chain of events as the light of their past begins to cast down, revealing the true nobility of his beloved aunt's character.  As for his mother, her shine becomes more tarnished yet the power of forgiveness comes from within John's own shattered heart to heal his family.  For me, this resonated deep within me because it revealed what power his own troubled spirit brought forth when the adults around him could not find it within their capacity to forgive each other or themselves - the love of a child heals this family rather than the adults themselves.

Sadly, more tragedy followed but his mates pulled together around him and his bonds with Mimi deepened which I think saved John Lennon so that he could share his gifts with the rest of us.

The ending of the film, as the credits rolled, was beautiful.

In my opinion, it was the best part of the film and my wife, who is not a music fan but values family and friendship above all things, cried openly.

I won't tell you what it was because I don't want to lessen the impact it could have on you but I would highly recommend that watch this story of family.

Anybody who has dealt a harsh hand in life but has still got a family that loves them (no matter how imperfect or crazy they can be) and sees them through it can consider themselves richly blessed.

This movie helps affirm that.",1296864000,,3742,4.437134502923977

He hates school and his strict aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and his mother who abandoned him when he was five.

This little film tells the interesting and sad story of Lennon's childhood and his search for maternal love.  Unfortunately, Johnson not only lacks charisma, he doesn't look or sound anything like John and that was a big disappointment.  I had to keep reminding myself who he was supposed to be; this could have been about any unhappy young man and I was expecting more.  The actors who play Paul and George look nothing like them, either; if they didn't call each other by name, you'd never know who was who.  Scott Thomas is absolutely wonderful  playing a tough and seemingly cold woman who really loves John but is unable to show it; her scenes are the most dramatic and enjoyable.

The period is recreated well with costumes, hair styles, music, and set decoration.

Ever since me Mum gave me the Red and Blue albums the day they came out, my ears have been very happy. Lennon and McCartney introduced me to music and nothing's given me more joy, so I kind of feel like John and Paul are my older brothers, and watching Nowhere Boy I felt that even more. Fab Four fan or not, anybody who enjoys fine acting and writing is likely to enjoy this film, especially Kristen Scott Thomas' typically superb performance and the solid lead turn by Aaron Johnson.

The script is also excellent, near perfect in fact, showing more and saying less than it might, and all to the good. It slows a bit about an hour in but picks up very nicely (if sadly) towards the end. I would have liked a bit more Paul/music stuff there and less melodrama, but the relationships are what this one is all about, so fair enough. If you love John's songs as deeply as so many millions (billions?) do, you'll see and feel where so much of his spirit and outlook comes from. When I played for a living I used to slip a version of In My Life into some gigs at quieter moments, and Nowhere Boy reminded me why so many people in the crowd would get kind of misty-eyed during that tune. Lennon had heart and so very much of it, and he wasn't afraid to trot it out and share it with us all. This movie does justice to that thought, to the man, and to the boyhood that gave rise to the most popular musical group this planet has ever seen.

Anne Marie Duff is wonderful as Julia, giving her the many sides John's erstwhile mother clearly had. She and Kristen and Aaron have some very powerful scenes together, and their connection makes this film sing. The blu-ray is good, the transfer crisp and the extras ok, though I would have liked even more in-depth stuff, but then what Lennon aficionado wouldn't? And it's sad that there's no classic Beatles music here, but the early rock stuff still rocks.

Highly recommended not only for Beatles fans but for anyone who enjoys a well-paced film that goes from funny to sad back and forth, over and over, and leaves you feeling like you know (and love) these people even more than you thought you did.",1296518400,,2151,4.356608478802992
4071364,4,B0035MA5HS,"There have been tons of biopics made about various stars and musicians. Some are popular but bring nothing to the table. But then there are others that not only offer a new perspective on the subject at hand but have the ability to inspire viewers to dig deeper into the person they've just watched a film about. Such is the case with NOWHERE BOY, a biopic about the young John Lennon.

Rather than focus the entire film on the beginnings of the Beatles, it instead takes Lennon as its subject and brings them in later. Aaron Johnson stars as Lennon, living with his Uncle George (David Threlfall) and Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas). When his uncle suddenly passes away, he sees a woman at the cemetery watching from a distance. Its only later that he discovers this woman is his mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff).

In trouble at school and feeling he is suffering under the strict upbringing offered him by Mimi, John sets out to find his mother. A friend discovers where she is living and much to John's surprise it's within walking distance.

Arriving at her doorstep, he reunites with his mother and they become friends. But that's the thing; they seem more like friends than mother/son. Julia is a free spirit, a woman who loves rock n' roll music and wants to have fun, much like the adolescent John. And as their friendship grows it takes on an almost oedipal tone.

John continues to have school problems and eventually decides he wants to form a band. Recruiting various friends he forms a skiffle band that plays at local events. Then one of these friends brings along someone he knows, a fellow by the name of Paul McCartney and, as they say, history is made.

The rivalry between these two starts the moment that they meet. Paul is skilled at playing the guitar while John is merely using banjo chords his mother taught him to play. Paul, though younger, becomes a mentor musically to John. And while their rivalry is apparent, so is their growing affection for one another.

Through the story John remains conflicted by the adults in his life. Where one has raised him as her own she keeps a tight hold on him. The other offers him a frivolous life of fun but little responsibility. And as these two women, both who adore the young boy, face off with one another neither quite knows the affect that it has on him. But one day the words pour out of him in his music.

The best part of this movie is not the soundtrack though it is well done. The best part of the movie is actually discovering the tip of the ice berg that was John Lennon. In finding out the things that made him who he was, we are offered a glimpse behind the scenes at why he was the way he was, what inspired him, how he achieved fame and fortune. Most will remember the celebrity that was John Lennon, few knew the man. This film gives us a glimpse and perhaps will inspire those who watch to find out more about him.

Aaron Johnson does an amazing job as Lennon, never dumbing down his portrayal by trying to sound and look exactly like him, instead portraying the youngster filled with troubles instead. He performs the role as an actor portraying a character rather than as an actor mimicking a personality and the performance does well because of that.

Kristin Scott Thomas and Marie-Anne Duff both turn in interesting performances as well. They form the yin and yang that made up the man that became John Lennon; the much reserved and proper Brit and the fun loving free spirit that brought out more artistically. Each conveys their roles well but it's the underlying emotions that they display with little more than a nod or subtle form of body language that makes their characters seem more real.

I wasn't sure if I'd like this movie. Having lived through the later Beatles years (SGT. PEPPER was the first actual album I ever purchased) I knew the bits and pieces that made up the band. Lennon always came off as sort of a know it all, a cocky individual who always thought he was above everyone else. This movie made me rethink that opinion and want to seek out more information about him. My guess is that others will as well.

Yes the story of the Beatles is covered here and may inspire you to learn more about that too. But the fact is Lennon is front and center here. The film draws you in and never bores. What more could one want from a biopic?",1296432000,,4343,4.491761723700887

4071366,3,B0035MA5HS,"There have been plenty of biographies and stories written about John Lennon, the world renown English musician and singer-songwriter, most notably known as one of the founding members of The Beatles.

But while books have covered the difficulties that John Lennon had faced during his teenage years, no one really had details of his life.  All we have heard was how he didn't have a mother, how he got into a lot of trouble and used that teenage angst to form the quarrymen, his first band which led him to one of the greatest musical collaborations and that was Lennon and Paul McCartney meeting, which followed with musician George Harrison joining them and of course, going on to Hamburg, Germany where along with Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best would go on to create the band, The Beatles (at the time, were a five-member band).

But for those who wondered about John Lennon's life, especially being raised by his Aunt Mimi and his troubled relationship with his mother Julia, it was not until 1989 where Lennon's half sister Julia Baird would write the book ""John Lennon, My Brother"" written with Giuliano and featured a foreword by Paul McCartney.  In 2007, she followed up with a second book titled ""Imagine This - Growing Up with My Brother John Lennon"".

In 2009, a film adaptation based on Julia Baird's biography was created.  The 2009 British-Canadian biopic focused on John Lennon's adolescence, how he learned to play the guitar, the creation of this first band The Quarrymen and how he would meet Paul McCartney.  But also details about his mother and his Aunt Mimi, who raised Lennon.

The film would be the first feature film for director Sam Taylor-Wood and would star young actor (and Wood's current fiance) Aaron Johnson (""Kick-Ass"", ""The Illusionist"", ""Shanghai Knights"") and Kristin Scott Thomas (""The English Patient"", ""Gosford Park"", ""Mission: Impossible"".  ""Nowhere Boy"" would be nominated for four British Academy Award Films including a nomination for ""Outstanding British Film"", ""Best Supporting Actress"" and ""Outstanding Debut by a British Director"".

The film would be released in the US in October 2010 to coincide with John Lennon's 70th Birthday.

""Nowhere Boy"" is about John Lennon (played by Aaron Johnson), a young man who lives with his Aunt Mimi (played by Kristin Scott Thomas) and his Uncle George (played by David Threlfall).  John isn't too much into school and he and his friends often get into trouble or have fun with the girls at his school.

But after the passing of his Uncle George (who was more lenient and happy going than his strict Aunt Mimi), John continues to get into more trouble and eventually getting suspended from school and trying to find ways for his aunt not to find out.

One day as he went out with a friend, he learns that he found where his mother Julia has been living.  Assuming that she lived far away, John is shocked that she doesn't live far from where he lives.  So, he goes to visit her and despite the awkwardness of their meeting, the two bond remarkably fast and he sees her vibrant and free-will, almost similar to his style.

Julia Lennon lives with John ""Bobby"" Dykins and their two young daughters Julia and Jacqui.  Despite Bobby not so happy to see John cause a change in their family dynamics, he knows that Julia is happy meeting her son again, who she keeps calling him ""her dream"".

But when John gets suspended once again, he needs to pretend that he is going to school but instead he visits his mother.  Both have an appreciation for music and when she takes him to see a theater performance for Elvis Presley, John Lennon is changed.  But unfortunately, he doesn't know how to play any instruments.  So, Julia goes to teach him how to play the banjo.

When the school contacts Mimi about John's suspension, she learns from his friend the secret that John has been keeping from her.  That he has been going to her sister's Julia's home.

This leads to an argument with John and his Aunt Mimi and John goes to live with Julia.  Despite Julia and the girls being happy about them living together, her boyfriend Bobby feels she is neglecting the girls and that John needs to go.  John overhears this and moves out of his mother's home back to Aunt Mimi and both get back to good terms with each other.  But they make a deal.  If John does well in school, she will buy him a guitar.

This begins John Lennon's pursuit of being a musician and immediately creates a band with his buddies called ""The Quarrymen"".  They perform at a local gig and eventually impress another 15-year-old musician who wants to meet John Lennon.  The boy turns out to be Paul McCartney who shows off his guitar-playing talent which impresses Lennon and eventually Paul becomes a member.

As the film continues to focus on John's pursuit of becoming a musician and in a band, the film focuses on relationships and we learn why John Lennon was raised by his Aunt Mimi, why his mother abandoned him and how he and his new music friends would go on to Hamburg, Germany (where he and his other bandmates would go on to create ""The Beatles"").

VIDEO:

""Nowhere Boy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  The film is absolutely vibrant in colors but also the film utilizes special lens filters to give a faded look in which colors are intentionally softer and not bolder but it looks fantastic.  I saw no signs of DNR, no artifacting.  Blacks were nice and deep nor did I see any banding.

""Nowhere Boy"" features fantastic PQ.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Nowhere Boy"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The film features a strong center and front channel drive lossless track with dialogue and music becoming clear.  There is some use of surround, mainly when it comes to crowd scenes and you can hear the ambiance through those surround channels.

The music for the film is very good, crystal clear and heard no problems with the audio at all.  But this is a dialogue and music driven film, so expect to see more center and front channel driven audio.

As for subtitles, ""Nowhere Boy"" is presented in English and English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Nowhere Boy"" features the following special features in standard definition:

  * Deleted Scenes - (3:55) Featuring two deleted scenes: ""John and Julie"" and ""A Quick Chat"".
  * The Making of Nowhere Boy - (7:46) Featuring interviews with director Sam Taylor Wood and the cast and the making of the film.
  * Nowhere Boy: The Untold Story of John Lennon and the Creation of The Beatles - (13:10) Director Sam Taylor Wood, Martin Lewis (Beatles Historian), Yoko Onno and others talk about ""Nowhere Boy"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to John Lennon, you think you read or seen it all when it comes to the Beatles by the many writings, biographies, documentaries out there but I have to admit, although I read about how John Lennon got into a bit of trouble as a teen, you never knew how sad his life was.

Yoko Onno said about ""Nowhere Boy"" that John would have been happy with the film because people would get to learn how sad his life was.  And most of all, how he endured from all that pain.  What I found pretty interesting, especially since this story was based on Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird's book was how free-spirited their mother Julia was.  How she would flirt with John and also flirt with his bandmates (especially with Paul McCartney) and as seen in the film, would upset John Lennon.

We also got to see some of that Lennon and McCartney rivalry as both liked the attention from the women, John much more.  But of course, this biggest bombshell was finding out why John Lennon was raised by his Aunt Mimi and abandoned by his mother.  And needless to say, the tragedy that took place life not much longer.

""Nowhere Boy"" is an exciting and enjoyable biopic for anyone who is fascinated by the Beatles, especially for those who want to learn more about John Lennon and even if you're not a fan.  This is one part of his life that has never been featured before in a film or documentary and so, it was a surprise but also quite refreshing to see something that took place in Lennon's adolescence versus his time with the Beatles, after the Beatles and leading up to his death.

The film looks fantastic on Blu-ray and director Sam Taylor-Wood does a great job in bringing Julia Baird's book to life in this film.

But where this Blu-ray release does disappoint me, its because of its lack of special features.

The UK Icon Home entertainment Blu-ray release featured a wonderful audio commentary by director Sam Taylor-Wood but it's not in the US Blu-ray release.  We also don't get the ""Lennon's Liverpool"", ""Anatomy of a scene: That's When I Stole him"", ""Photo Gallery"", ""Interview"", ""The Re-Creation of Lennon and the Quarrymen"" and more deleted scenes which had a commentary by Sam Taylor-Wood.  We do get the newer ""Nowhere Boy: The Untold Story of John Lennon and the Creation of the Beatles Featurette"".  Typically, we tend to get exact to more features of what the UK has and this UK Blu-ray release was back in May 2010.

So, I'm a little bummed out by the lack of special features that did not make it over for the US release.  Fortunately, because this Blu-ray release is BD-Live enabled, hopefully Sony chooses to have it available via BD-Live in the near future.

Otherwise, ""Nowhere Boy"" gives us an idea of how troubled John Lennon was as a teenager and in many ways, it does give me an idea why as an adult, he had trust issues and also got himself into trouble and excessive drug use.  The biopic shows us that even before the Beatles, before the Quarrymen, Lennon living without his mother and father and being raised by his strict aunt was tough for him.  The film doesn't examine why he had a trouble life growing up but we get to see that pain he had lived with.

I did question the validity of the story at first but after seeing how it was based off Julia Baird's book, and as a young girl, got to know John Lennon as a teenager around the house but also receiving some input from Yoko Onno (who loved the film) and Paul McCartney, you realized that unfortunates circumstances helped shape Lennon's life and eventually leading him and his friends and going to Hamburg, Germany and eventually creating the Beatles.

""Nowhere Boy"" is an intriguing, exciting but also sad biopic but it does give us a look at John Lennon's personal life and what shaped him as a musician.

4071367,5,B0035MA5HS,I thought this was a great movie...it helped me to better understand the early life of John Lennon and what he went through in order to become successful.

4071368,4,B0035MA5HS,"I liked this movie.  What I gave points off for was the fact that it lacked Liverpool's gritty look and it had a somewhat idealized version of everything I've read of John's relationship with his Mother.  But the young man who played John did himself proud.  As the film went on and the conflict over Mimi and his Mother emerged, he gave John a more rebellious feel.  The film could have gone farther in presenting a less glossy version of his teen years but this is still a film worth watching, with a special shout out to Kristin Scott Thomas in her portrayal of Mimi.",1296000000,,570,4.4
4071369,4,B0035MA5HS,"A biopic about a young John Lennon (Johnson) and the events that led him to the forming of the Beatles.  More than music, this movie is about the relationships in John's life and how they shaped him into the legend he would become.  The main relationship that is focused on is the triangle between John, his mother and his aunt (Thomas) who raised him.  I am a fan of the Beatles music, but I'm not a real big Lennon fan (I'm a drummer so I like Ringo), which made about 90% of this movie events and people I did not know about.  The first half of the movie is pretty slow moving, but the second half makes up for it.  The one complaint I have is from scene to scene it changes years and you are left to figure that out halfway through.  It seems like they had too much info they wanted in so it feels choppy. In one scene John says we are starting a band, the next scene the band is playing.  The little things I noticed are not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the show though.  A solid movie, nowhere near the caliber of ""Ray"" or ""Walk The Line"", but overall entertaining.  I give it a B.

4071371,4,B0035MA5HS,"I may not be the biggest fan of the Beatles but, having entered college when they first appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show, they were certainly part of my life. I learned about the forming of the band from the excellent film Backbeat and this film is sort of the prequel to that film.

No I'm not fact checking everything stated in the film - I watched it for entertainment value. I'll leave the ""research questions"" to those who know more about that. But I wasn't aware of John Lennon's relationship with his mother and aunt and, frankly, the less you know before watching this film, the more emotional impact it will have on you. So I won't re-hash the story here.

There will probably be comments from others on the fact there are no Beatle's hits on the soundtrack. Well, that's because they weren't written at the time the story takes place.

The bonus features include TWO deleted scenes - nice to watch but only three minutes total - A seven-minute ""Making of...."" featurette which covers some things in the only-slightly-longer featurette: ""Nowhere Buy: The Untold Story of John Lennon and the creation of The Beatles"". Sadly, a lot of those 13 minutes is taken up with scenes taken from the film.

You don't need to be a Beatle fan to enjoy this film. The actors who play John and Paul don't look as much like their real life counterparts as many would like. That only bothered me for the first five minutes and then the story, and excellent action, took me in.

I for one am glad they film was made and recommend it to any pop music fan.

Aaron Johnson gives a terrific, James Dean-worthy performance as a teenaged John Lennon. The story zeroes in on a specific, crucially formative period of the musical icon's life beginning just prior to his first meet-up with Paul McCartney, and ending on the eve of the ""Hamburg period"". The story is not so much about the Fabs, however, as it is about the complex and mercurial dynamic of the relationship between John, his Aunt Mimi (Kirstin Scott Thomas) and his mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff). The entire cast is uniformly excellent, but Scott Thomas (one of the best actresses currently strolling the planet) handily walks away with the film as the woman who raised John from childhood.

I had a chance to get an early DVD of it about 6 months ago and came away from it feeling very sad. Yet again, another Lennon biopic that's so far off the mark. The inaccuracies are rampant. I didn't think the acting was that good. I thought the scouse was lousy. The biggest problem I had though was beyond the aesthetics (although the actor having blue eyes instead of brown bugged the crap outta me). The portrayal of Julia was such a caricature! Yes, Julia was very flirtatious and free-thinking...there's no denying that, but for god sake, they make her out to be a psychotic whore bound and determined to bed her own son. Just because John mentioned an incident in his audio diary (which is very true), they've taken that moment and made it the focus of their relationship. I think it's horrible. I also would hate to think of how the portrayal of Mimi would have been before the re-write. As it is, they have her as ""Mimi the Hun"". The woman DID have a heart and NEVER threw things at John's head. She would have died first. I just worry that the ""average"" Beatles/Lennon fan will come away from this movie with the wrong idea about Julia and Mimi, and that will, over time, colour his life, which is now becoming more mythology than fact.

4071375,5,B0035MA5HS,"Sam Taylor-Wood's Nowhere Boy is a marvelously moving depiction of the early life of John Lennon, covering the period from when he is about fifteen and first becoming interested in music to when he is nineteen, when he and his band, The Quarrymen, are about to leave for a gig in Hamburg that would see them emerge as the band known all over the world as the Beatles.

Everything about this film works. Not only because of a great cast of actors, but in the way that it captures the look and feel not only of Liverpool in the late 50's and early 60's, but also of the transitioning music scene of the period, dominated in the beginning by American jazz and rock & roll but soon to be overturned by what would be called (on our side of the pond anyway) as the British Invasion.  One of the many remarkable achievements that Taylor-Wood manages to pull off in the film is the subtle way in which she shows Lennon starting with influences like Buddy Holly and Elvis but then slowly moving to create his own sound, particularly after he connects with an even younger Paul McCartney.

The performances of the entire cast are worthy of praise, but two I feel deserve special attention: Aaron Johnson as John Lennon, and Kristin Scott Thomas as his Aunt Mimi. Johnson was best known for his perfomance as the title character in the cult super-hero film Kick-Ass, but his immersion in Lennon's character in Nowhere Boy was so thorough that he was almost unrecognizable. Scott Thomas, a veteran actress of many films of note, including The English Patient, Four Weddings And A Funeral, and The Other Boleyn Girl, was more recognizable, but all the more remarkable for bringing off the very complex character of Lennon's Aunt Mimi, the woman who raised him from the age of five. To bring out Mimi, Scott Thomas has to portray a woman who is tough as nails, making the hard decisions in life while keeping her inner feelings to herself, but who does in fact have feelings that every now and then must come out for the people she does in fact care deeply about. It is a highly challenging role and Scott Thomas pulls it off magnificently. Both performances are Oscar-worthy and I sincerely hope that the Academy will give them the recognition they so richly deserve.

I highly recommend this film for anyone with an interest in John Lennon, the Beatles, the music of this highly important period, or simply in the lives of musicians and how they become the people the world comes to know. Or for anyone who just loves an extraordinarily well-crafted movie with stellar performances and a truly moving story.",1288483200,52,2595,4.647058823529412
4071376,5,B0035MA5HS,"I've been looking forward to this movie. I've been following reviews and articles about it and the mention of not strictly sticking to the chronological facts, but after seeing ""Nowhere Boy"" I would say it captures the emotional/psychological truth that John Lennon experienced.

Aaron Johnson plays John Lennon, a teenager who is torn between the love of two women, his mother Julia (Anne-Marie Duff) and his Aunt Mimi (Kristin Scott Thomas). His Aunt has been raising him since age 5 because his mother for unspecified reasons, although it is hinted that it's manic depression, can't take care of him. ""Nowhere Boy"" follows John Lennon's life from roughly age 14 to 19, a fairly tumultuous period  in Lennon's life. Lennon's mother teaches him to play the banjo and indulges him, while his Aunt Mimi must be the responsible parent and tries to instill some discipline in the boy. It is this tug-of-love situation that sends the young Lennon ricocheting between his mother's house and his aunt's house, and slowly pulling the boy apart while his own needs drive him to rebellion and Rock `n' Roll.

While these domestic tidal forces are forming the nascent John Lennon, Lennon is forming the nascent Beatles, The Quarrymen. Lennon forms the band by allowing his school mates to be in the band. Soon Lennon meets Paul McCartney (Thomas Sangster) and forms one of the strongest male bonds of his life, and maybe pop music.

Aaron Johnson plays Lennon cool, aloof, even when Lennon's life is unraveling before him and he's learning truths about his life he probably wouldn't have wanted to know. He can't turn back because he instigated the revelations.

Kristin Scott Thomas plays Aunt Mimi as a strong willed woman who at once can also be vulnerable at the death of her husband, or the love in her eyes while Lennon is tearing her apart by rejecting her in favor of his mother, but she stays strong. Anne-Marie Duff's Julia is flighty and raw vulnerability, and her love for John is unquestioned. Sangster while not at first seeming to resemble Paul McCartney developing the qualities of McCartney his love of music and growing commitment to John. The acting has good solid performances, and several scenes are highly emotional because you believe in these people as human beings.

Although these two movies weren't conceived as such and were made 16 years apart, ""Nowhere Boy"" is sort of a prequel to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Backbeat-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00028HBJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Backbeat (Collector's Edition)</a>"" and they make nice companion pieces and fit nicely together in the Lennon/Beatles story.

Special Features include a couple of deleted scenes, a making of that includes interviews with the cast and director Sam Taylor Wood, and the documentary Nowhere Boy: The Untold Story of John Lennon and the Creation of The Beatles.",1288310400,4,2900,5.223655913978495

'Nowhere Boy' gives us Lennon at the apex of his youthful rebellion...and the accompanying angst related to his confusing maternal situation.  'Nowhere Boy' depicts mother Julia as flighty, unstable and incapable of the long-term commitment of motherhood.  She is, however, also creative, spirited, musical and unique.  Julia's sister, Mary ('Aunt Mimi'), is by contrast depicted as a stern disciplinarian and in it for the long haul.  In terms of her attitude to music, it's summed up by her famous line, ""The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it.""  Mimi is, however, also shown to possess a sly but fierce intellect.  Director Sam Taylor-Wood shows some witty repartee and quick, punning wordplay between Kristin Scott Thomas' Mimi and Aaron Johnson's John.  The John Lennon the world came to know is equal parts these two maternal influences.

Director Taylor-Wood and designers Alice Normington, Kimberley Fahey and Barbara Herman-Skelding do a marvelous job re-creating Liverpool of the late fifties/early sixties.  This was an England still bobbing along in austere, post-World War II style.  The look of the film perfectly captures a grayer, tight-fisted, more cossetted nation...one that would indelibly change a few short years in the future, in no small part due to John and his bandmates. Contributing to the success of that look is young Mr. Johnson himself.  He is, at times, the spitting image of Lennon...especially when donning those NHS-issued specs.

This movie has some resonating pop culture influence as well: star Johnson and director Taylor-Wood - with 23 years in age difference - are engaged to be married.  Taylor-Wood gave birth to their daughter in July 2010.",1287792000,3,2373,5.56824512534819
4071378,5,B0035MA5HS,"Actually this is a good movie even if you didn't know or care about John Lennon. It's simply a good story. The fact that it's well acted, well directed, and has a great soundtrack of classic rock and roll songs makes it worth watching even if you aren't a Lennon or Beatles fan.

However if you love John Lennon as many of us do, I think you will find this to be among the best of the Beatles-genre movies. I rate it right up there with ""Backbeat"".

You should know, however, that this movie is not really about the Beatles. It does show the meeting of Paul, and George and the beginning of the Quarrymen, but these events are really incidental to the main story. The main story is John's relationship with his Aunt Mimi and Uncle George and of course his mother, Julia.

The movie focuses on the years when he re-met his mother and then just past the time when she was killed in a car accident, which coincided with the time he formed the Quarrymen and eventually went to Hamburg with the Silver Beatles. The movie makes this period of time seem like just a year or two when actually he re-met his mother around the age of 11 and she was killed when he was 17. There are other ""inaccuracies"" and if this sort of thing bothers you then you will not enjoy this movie. If you can get past these kind of inaccuracies and connect with the movie on an emotional level, then you will enjoy that, which I think is portrayed fairly accurately, or at least believably.

Basically, this movie is an emotional one about a dysfunctional, broken family.
