8475605,5,B0008GPAPQ,"""The Final Chapter"" is with a doubt the most captivating of this 4 part series. While the D-Day landing beaches and battle fields of the Ardennes  Offensive are interesting sights to see as they appear today, it's the tour of the massive Berlin Reich Chancellery bunker that's represents the highlight of this unique film. The remaining intact structure is both  haunting and mesmerizing. A must see. It gives a real insight as to what the Fuehrer Bunker would've looked like today if it were still intact. Great color footage and first generation archival footage. Outstanding and highly recommend for history buffs of the Reich and educators alike.",1116720000,4,650,5.065420560747664
