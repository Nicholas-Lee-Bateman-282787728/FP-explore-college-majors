8703473,4,B00TZ8H7QI,I really had no idea of how much of a well traveled performer Dr. Tom Pritchard. I was privileged to see him when he wrestled in Los Angeles in the dying days of the promotion. This is an excellent product for fans who really enjoyed watching weekly telecast of Championship Wrestling form Georgia.,1444608000,,298,4.6415094339622645

8703475,2,B00TZ8H7QI,"There is no actual wrestling footage, just an interview.  I gave a second star because the discussion was interesting for a while, but ultimately I got this video to see a few Georgia Championship matches that I remember fondly from my youth. The interview did get me thinking about Georgia Championship Wrestling from back in the day and, luckily, there are a bunch of the actual wrestling episodes on YouTube.",1425772800,6,411,4.871428571428571
