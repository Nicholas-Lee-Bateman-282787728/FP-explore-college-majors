6936317,1,B00RWUOEN0,"Tries to be a hip sci fi movie by basing the story on a time paradox. But the acting and production quality are so horrible that it comes off as being something any 16 year old sci fi reader could have done a better job at. Don't waste your money. Not worth what Amazon is charging for it. Maybe $0.99 for the SD version, but not worth $3.99.",1426982400,,342,4.044117647058823

6936321,4,B00RWUOEN0,The score made the movie. Suspenseful music kept you on the edge of your seat. Interesting plot.,1426291200,2,96,4.705882352941177
6936322,1,B00RWUOEN0,"Good cinematography.
Good score.
Awful Script. The swearing was just thrown in for good measure. You don't need to add the ""f"" word for emphasis. Felt so unnatural every time it was said. Confusing story line. Weak. Why all the different accents....Australian, British....odd choices. Utterly bizarre how one minute we were in the US and then suddenly a cutaway shot of sheep in the British countryside with a farmer shooting at Mike. I laughed out loud. Not for good reasons. Utterly bizarre. Totally unbelievable. The relationships between the characters was never properly explained.
Terrible casting. Some of the most wooden acting I have ever had the misfortune of watching. (With the exception of Aleisha Force)",1426291200,3,717,5.243478260869566
6936323,1,B00RWUOEN0,"The volume was extremely bad.  Had it fully up throughout parts of the movie,  returning this one. Can't believe they would sell this with such a bad quality",1426204800,2,157,4.571428571428571

6936329,5,B00RWUOEN0,"It took awhile for me to get into the swing of this movie and once I did I really began to enjoy it. Unlike ""The Final Conflict"" where the aircraft carrier Nimitz goes back in time just before the attack on Pearl Harbor and does nothing. This movie does do something. This movie makes you think about what you are seeing and hearing. The cast are all unknowns and the story will hold your attention.",1429315200,,399,4.333333333333333
6936330,1,B00RWUOEN0,"If I could give 0 stars for this movie, I would.  It had poor script, poor dialog, poor storyline, overuse of computer animation which looked cartoonist, bad acting, gratuitous obscenity served no purpose.  It was a total waste of time.",1428883200,2,236,4.875
6936331,4,B00RWUOEN0,"Not the best audio mix, but considering  the film's micro budget, it's a terrific effort.",1428624000,,89,4.933333333333334

6936333,2,B00RWUOEN0,"Oh my! I have always said ""...no such thing as a BAD time travel movie"", until now.
My wife came running into my home theater screaming ""WHY the HELL are you listening to this
movie on volume level 100!?""
I told her that the m-u-s-i-c was louder than the dialogue.
I LOVE time travel movies, especially ones with the Navy [I retired from both the Army and Navy].
This was NOT ""Final Countdown"", with the, now, 99-year-old Kirk Douglas, NOR was this any of the
THREE ""Philadelphia Experiment"" movies.
I WANTED to like this movie; the preview trailer looked good, BUT---and I have a really big BUTT---
this movie suffered from the following:
1.) It featured NO ONE that was likable enough for me to care IF they lived or died during the course
of the movie. The main character [an unlikable drunk] should've committed suicide; NOT his grandfather.
2.) There were various accents, so, it was unusual... and, unnecessarily, distracting.
3.) The movie was over two-hours; and yet, seems to me the deleted scenes contained MORE interesting
footage than what I wasted my TIME with in this TIME-travel movie.
_____________________________________________________________________________
It w-a-s GREAT that actual warships were used, and it WAS filmed inside an actual SUBMARINE----
here comes my big BUTT again----but, this ""Sub-conscious"" movie was sub-par in every area of film-
making, except photography.",1428105600,6,1401,5.20353982300885
6936334,3,B00RWUOEN0,"If your looking for a great adventure this may not be it. But if you are looking at seeing the inside of a WWII desiel boat this may be it.
Weak plot, unknown actors ( at least by me), fair videography, more than a few F bombs. All and all not terrible. I enjoyed it, but that's just me.
I never knew how the got those old torpedoes in to the tube, but now I know.",1427414400,,364,3.8026315789473686
6936335,1,B00RWUOEN0,Acting was almost embarrasing.  I kept wondering who put the $ up for this movie.,1427414400,,81,4.4
6936336,1,B00RWUOEN0,"Didn't even finish it, the over acting is so phenomenal and story line is hard to follow because of the scene jumping. I think it had potential with the right director at the helm.",1427328000,,180,4.323529411764706
8696177,4,B00RWUOEN0,Suspenseful movie that starts out and rivets you to your seat but then fades about 3/4 of the way through.,1493251200,,106,4.35

8696181,3,B00RWUOEN0,"As much as I love watching ""depth charges"" I found the lead actor in this one cocky and annoying to watch.  The story is interesting enough to watch but will not have you at the edge of your seat.  I found myself at the end of this one, longing for some of ""The Final Countdown"" with Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen.  Yes, I rented it and enjoyed every minute!",1445472000,,358,4.159420289855072
8696182,4,B00RWUOEN0,"I liked  it,  It kept my attention.  I prefer happy silly shows,but thought this was quite good.",1433030400,,96,4.529411764705882
8696183,5,B00RWUOEN0,Cool movie couldn't figure it out until the end. NO SPOILERS your going to have to watch it,1431648000,,91,4.111111111111111
8696184,1,B00RWUOEN0,"It's pretty bad when a featured performer has his lines and/or stage directions written on his palm!  Also, I didn't know Kriegsmarine crewmen wore sports slacks and shirts when diving their WWII subs.  Verrrry interesting ...",1431302400,,226,5.25
8696185,1,B00RWUOEN0,"very poor plot, low impact acting, story line is very poor.  In my opinion, this film does a disservice to the submarine community of the US Navy.",1431216000,,146,4.407407407407407
8696186,1,B00RWUOEN0,"WHY oh why do I buy movies without consulting Amazon first? I am always looking for good sci fi films and based on the plot description I thought it might be good. But...it is HORRIBLE.The directing is abominable there are elements of the plot which make no sense, for instance the character of Mikie. We have little to no character development. I have seen high school actors do better jobs with dialogue that these guys. The ""F"" Bomb is dropped continually and I don't normally care about language, but it was used so often that one gets the opinion that the writers had no idea of what else the characters should say. There are military guards with scruffy half beards and there is really no explanation at all as to why the events of the movie happened. I don't mean that it had an ambiguous ending like the last episode of THE PRISONER, I mean that there is no attempt at all to draw one into it intellectually. Once again it's as if the writers didn'y know what todo with the story, so they just let it drop. The CGI is cheapo and all in all it's as bad as anything I've seen Scifi or Artisan put out. DON'T BUY IT! I'm giving my copy to Goodwill, at least there someone might find it and get an evenings entertainment out of it. As for me, it's RUBBISH.",1429920000,,1260,4.320675105485232
