8165021,3,B000LXHK3Q,"A great feature of Amy's DVDs are the menu options-chapters, NRG mixes, longer or shorter workouts.  This is an average workout, not extraordinary or memorable.  Athletic moves on the step for the first half and then working with weights on the step for the second half.  It's not really a total body sculpting workout, and the abs/core is just two exercises I believe.  One of them is called the jack knife, and I honestly don't feel/see the purpose of this move??  For a similar (yet more intense) cardio & sculpt workout, I prefer Amy's A-TEAM BOOTCAMP.",1262822400,,556,4.75
8165022,4,B000LXHK3Q,"I'm not a fan of HiLo .. or at least I wasn't until I tried Amy's style.  This is not your hip-hop dance, nor is it your 'mom' style aerobics.  Amy's HiLo is full of athletic drills.  It is higher-impact, that can be modified to a low-impact with some previous experience.  The cardio section, including the warmup (in which you will sweat) is about 20 mins.  The rest of the workout is fun, different, and innovative takes with Amy's spin on weights and band work.  You will feel it!",1178841600,2,484,4.382022471910112
