It showed how living in suite-case is not as wonderful as you think.  I kind of thing the team manager of Baxton's was Shaun White's chaperon at the time. There were quite a few interviews after his various runs at the X-games which seen to convey same information about Shaun White repetitively.  The part about Africa was OK,  I am not quite sure exact what the point of having it in video was though. I hoping for another form of this kind of video will be produced post 2006.  I hope the future video with display more about Shaun White's  biography information & highlights of his Olympic games and other potent events. I definitely got my money worth.",1519603200,,819,4.537414965986395

8263122,5,B0016MJ6G0,"I LOVED this film! I had never seen or heard of this one before, so I wasn't really sure how it was going to be. It ended up being one of my favorite films on him. It really gives you a sense of how hard he works to remain the best of the best, while also showing that even he needs a breather once in a while. My very favorite is when they go to Africa to show the kids ""something new"". I highly recommend this film to any Shaun White fan or people wanting to learn a little more about him :)",1331078400,,493,3.796116504854369

8263124,4,B0016MJ6G0,"This was a present for my daughter who is a real snowboarding fan. We watched it together and both thought is was very entertaining. I had thought it would be a lot of snowboarding footage but it is more about his life.

It contains a lot of behind the scenes material of Shaun as he prepares and competes in several events. It also contains quite a bit of personal commentary by Shaun as well as a look at his every day life outside his home. The video finishes with footage of his entry into the skateboarding arena.

It's well done, both audio and video are good. A good purchase that I would recommend for anyone who is a fan of Shaun.",1295222400,5,639,4.2727272727272725
