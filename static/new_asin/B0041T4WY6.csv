8413156,4,B0041T4WY6,The DVD wouldn't play on my TV...very disappointed. Had to play it on my small laptop as this is the only machine it worked on. People should be warned about this! Enjoyed the movie very much but the experience was completely marred by having to watch on small screen computer instead of through my TV and DVD player.,1406419200,,317,4.482758620689655
