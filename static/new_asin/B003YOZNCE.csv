4231318,2,B003YOZNCE,"As we were watching this film when it aired on PBS, I got involved with what the filmmaker, Edmund Coulthard was trying to say and take it at face value. I had fewer problems with the choice of casting that many others here seemed to have because to me it wasn't really about the cast. Being a self-considered Lennon fan this was a little hard for me to watch and I had to ask myself if it was the human ability to want to elevate our heroes after they are gone. The nostalgia factor as it were.

As another reviewer writes here, to me and what I know of John and his life, public and private, he was a complicated person, full of extremes. His talent and intelligence was unquestionable. His emotional side ran the gamete from nasty and very self-involved to very loving and giving of himself. He was, or acted like he was a little crazy. True artists, musicians and actors are often eccentric and self-absorbed. It seems go with the territory.

We know from all the other media about his life that John was not perfect but I think like many of us, he strove to be... to give something back. He was VERY human, and his life, by choice as well as not, has been well documented on film (home movies as well as professional footage,) books and interviews of those that knew him best!

So why would we need a semi-fictional biopic of this nature unless it had to do with money? Why was this film necessary for the director and producers to produce?

Upon reflection, I wonder what the purpose really was in making this film? Was this made in search of a new artistic angle in which to view Lennon's life, or in search of money? Did the film makers have a contractual necessity to make it? Were they behind the 8-ball and had to produce something the BBC could promote? I have to keep asking myself, what was the intention? What was the point?",1294272000,3,1839,4.368421052631579
4231319,4,B003YOZNCE,"Another docudrama that allows us to see ""some"" version of John Lennon's life.  It was informative and while not for everyone, I certainly enjoyed it.  If you are a fan then I think you'll like this.

Everyone must be aware that drama is added for drama sake and most ""real life"" movies are BASED on facts but enhanced for entertainment value.

Sorry to disagree with many of the other reviewers but I did find it entertaining and what more can you ask for as it is better to have items like this than nothing at all.",1293926400,,516,4.34375
4231320,1,B003YOZNCE,"Obviously the writer of this pile of crap had it in for John(was probably insanely jealous and/or another mark david chapman). From start to finish, painted John in the worst light possible, with lots of completely inaccurate
events even. There are lots of good books & movies about John and all of the Beatles, but this is NOT one of them.

Would NOT recommend to anyone!!  HORRIBLE!",1293148800,7,384,4.7164179104477615
4231321,1,B003YOZNCE,"I agree with everyone who said the actor portraying John was much too old-looking to be him, especially in younger years.  The wig looked silly.  I did not think any of the actors looked like who they were supposed to be portraying, except perhaps for the woman who portrayed Yoko.  I also agree that John had made some bad choices in his life, and was not a perfect saint.  I also agree that he was someone who did much good in his life, or tried to.  He tried to learn from his mistakes and attempted to make amends for some of the things he did that were hurtful to others.  He did not get the chance to continue to do so, as he was judged and executed by a very sick individual who blamed John for all of his own inadequacies and abuses by others.  He became John's judge and jury, and sentenced him to death, for being human, like the rest of us.  He robbed John of his chance to try and make things right, and he robbed John's children of their father, Yoko of her partner (no matter what the truth of their relationship was), and the world of a complicated, interesting, and extremely gifted artist who never claimed to be a perfect role model to anyone.  I fault this movie for not being balanced in it's portrayal of it's subject.  It shows perhaps some of the why's of his actions/reactions, but does not show anything positive that he did or tried to do.  There are many movies that just show John as this sainted talented musician, which is also not true.  He was many things.  These movies are not accurate, but neither is this portrayal of him, as someone who was injured as a child, and so became an unpleasant person who had no positive attributes of his own.  I believe John was so hard on himself about all of the mistakes he made; do we need to be hard on him also?  Haven't all of us done things that were not right; hurting others who were innocent because we were hurting ourselves, losing our patience and taking things out on whoever was near, etc.  Why is John judged on a so much higher level than the rest of us?  Why can't we accept him for who he was, instead of holding him to impossibly high standards that are impossible to achieve?  He never claimed to be perfect, he was just a human being who loved music, and tried to survive the crazy existence of living as a famous person in our society.  He did the best he could with the life experiences he was given, as we all try to do.  He produced some of the most beautiful music ever created for all of us to enjoy, while he was in the process of trying to live his life.  Why must he be only one extreme or another?  This movie is not a fair, definitive portrayal of John.  It is just another one-dimensional portrayal of a human being, who happened to be famous.  Who is he, really?  He is John.  Simply, John.  That's enough for me.  Shouldn't it be enough for all of us?",1292630400,5,2855,4.256505576208179
4231322,1,B003YOZNCE,"This is a very difficult movie to get through. As anyone who has read a book or two about Lennon, or heck even a detailed article about his life, knows he has his negative side. We all are flawed and we've all made poor choices. Lennon was no exception, having abandoned his first wife and child, abused drugs, and sometimes treated friends and business partners with disregard.

But, as evidenced by hours upon hours of audio and video footage, Lennon was an interesting, good humored, intensely creative person. None of that is portrayed in Lennon Naked. The film chooses to focus exclusively on the most depressing, least flattering aspects of Lennon's personality. We don't see him writing songs, playing guitar, or recording music.

The basic ""plot"" finds Lennon dealing with his father, who abandoned him as a child, returning to his life. After years of not seeing him, Freddie Lennon tries to re-establish a relationship with his son. The results are mixed, as Lennon hasn't forgiven him. During all of this, we see that Lennon treats his own son Julian roughly the same way.

I loved Christopher Eccleston as Doctor Who. Not only is he laughably old to be playing Lennon as 20something man (Eccleston is 46, six years older than Lennon at the time of his death), he looks nothing like him. He does a passable vocal impersonation but otherwise does very little to evoke Lennon.

Some scenes reenact press conferences that the real actual footage of is readily available (in far worthier films like the 1988 documentary ""Imagine: John Lennon""). In all cases, the actual footage is FAR more compelling than the staged versions. In other words, with so many documentary films existing about Lennon there is little reason to bother with this sad movie.",1292198400,16,1756,4.902356902356902
4231323,1,B003YOZNCE,"Are we seriously being asked to believe this actor represents Lennon?  The accent is over-the-top northern, he walks like a chimp bobbing dramatically from side to side, he has the physique of an overpumped college wrestler, and if his acting were any stiffer, it would shatter and litter the floor with a thousand pieces.  Sure Lennon was a salt-of-the-earth type of guy, yet you'd think you were watching a troglodyte when you see this bulging guy walk and talk and strain terribly every time he tries to think.  It's hopeless stuff.

And the script...think of all the overtold Lennon stories and lines we already know, and they are here.

Poor John, impersonated by an actor for whom subtlety is rocket science and finesse the name of a French salad.  When I think of the fine humor, the tastefulness, the wry irony, and the elegance in Lennon, I find it appalling to see how underprepared and unperceptive the people behind this movie were.  Here, Lennon strolls around like a dolt who is going through the shock of having his first idea.  Surely he deserves better.

I have no beef with the flick presenting Lennon's nastier side, just don't rob people of their time with such lousy product.

On the other hand, it may be worth a viewing just for the laughs...or the horror.",1292198400,14,1279,4.7207207207207205
4231324,1,B003YOZNCE,"One wonders at the intention behind this film. They have such blinders on that we can't see. It comes close to slander in that it sees nothing good in John Lennon...He was not a saint, but this is not a biography either. It's awful.",1291766400,11,232,4.295454545454546
4231325,4,B003YOZNCE,"My first thought was that I was disappointed that the actors in this film did not look anything like the real characters. As the film progressed, I found myself getting more involved and full of emotion. Lennon was a complex character and I believe he was truly mad. I'm not sure if his madness was drug induced or just part of his natural being. Lennon was a cruel, mean and angry man and his only cure was Yoko Ono. Eccleston did a fantastic job being Lennon. This film was like a fly on the wall view of this complex life. I'd definitely recommend this to all true Lennon fans.",1291593600,2,580,4.330275229357798
4231326,1,B003YOZNCE,"If you have fond feelings toward the memory of John Lennon, I would stay away from this film. It presents a pretty biased look at the final years of Lennon in the late 1960s presenting him as nothing but a radically depressed a-hole. Christopher Eccleston resembles a mid-1970s John Lennon & does a pretty good vocal impression. Im a fan of his and I wanted to like this production. Hes way too old to play the 23 year old Lennon we see in 1964 in the beginning. The Beatle wig looked silly on him. Naoko Mori is fine as Yoko. The guy who plays Paul does a good voice, but the Beatles other than Lennon don't resemble their real world counterparts, nor are they featured in much of this story. The entire tale dramatizes every depressing and negative thing that Lennon experienced/did during that era. Sure everyone can be depressed and everyone can be a cruel jerk once in a while, but thats almost all John Lennon is presented as here. What about all the fun, happy times which also fill our lives? Lennon is not permitted any. What of all the great music he created on the White Album, etc.? You won't see or hear anything about that here. Lennon left England because of the negative treatment he and Yoko received in the British press. The makers of this production seem to have never forgiven him for that and this film is their revenge. Im sure Lennon was a self-centered jerk plenty of times, but Im also sure thats not ALL he was.",1291507200,21,1438,4.450757575757576
4231327,4,B003YOZNCE,"The immediate reaction I had from the beginning of the film is that Christopher Eccleston is too old for this role of a young John. For a long time, I couldn't see anything more than Eccleston in a wig. Looking really nothing like John didn't help matters either. Needless to say, that it took me right out of the film. However, Eccleston's ernest portrayal of John won me somewhat over by the end. The story itself is good and the acting is even better. I liked the idea of the movie since that is one topic the Lennon movies never really talk about. You really get to see the hurt Lennon you could only before really experience through his music. Kind of ironic that John hated his dad for abandoning him as a child and yet he did the same thing to his own son, Julian. Overall, a good film that won me over with interesting interactions between a man and his father with great acting by the cast.",1290384000,8,899,4.325443786982248
4231341,1,B003YOZNCE,"This is a terrible movie. If you never knew anything about John Lennon, you would have a hard time getting through this film. Why would you have a 46-yr old actor play a 24-year old Beatle in the first place? The actor has no resemblance to John Lennon, the accent sounds very fake, and almost all the scenes in the movie are questionable of whether they actually took place. Lennon certainly had an angry side to him but he mostly had a great sense of humor and joyous moments in his life...otherwise, the music he made with the Beatles would have been very dark. Do yourself a favor and skip this terrible movie.",1397779200,,614,4.442477876106195
4231342,1,B003YOZNCE,"it's easy to forget, or overlook completely, that it's but one facet of a person we come to idolize. there's always that other side which, even if it isn't necessarily scandalous, no doubt has tastes and opinions contrary to one's own. i for instance would love to be Sherlock Holmes, the passionately resourceful crusader against crime and injustice. on the other hand i'm frankly relieved not to be Sherlock Holmes the quasi-misogynist cocaine addict. similarly, i'd give just about anything to be Freddie Mercury, the musician...provided i didn't absolutely have to be Freddie Mercury, the bird of paradise, as well. (i have no problem with the gays, i'm just not myself gay.)
so on general principle i'm all in favor of the warts-and-all approach, but there's such a thing as too many warts and not enough ""all.""
NAKED is a textbook example of that lopsidedness. this film's angle on it's subject isn't simply negative, it's downright snotty! you only have to listen to ""In My Life"" or ""Give Peace A Chance"" to know that, at least some of the time, he was more likable and compassionate than this.
Christopher Eccleston does a positively magnificent job for the most part, but he's at the mercy of a hopelessly biased script. i firmly believe that Eccleston is capable of channeling the humanist Lennon, the Lennon who wrote ""Imagine,"" but he's only given the opportunity to project the darker side, the Lennon who wrote the petty anti-Paul song ""How Do You Sleep?""
(interestingly, Paul is played here by Andrew Scott, most famous, at least at this writing, for his villainous turn in SHERLOCK. one wonders how Sir Paul feels about being portrayed by Jim Moriarty!)
the basic message of this movie is: John Lennon was a dick. and yes, he could be. indeed, wouldn't be the first case we've heard of artistic genius going hand-in-hand with dick tendencies. but who on Earth ever asked to see that side of him prioritized to the point of completely obscuring the talent, the imagination, the heart that endeared him to us in the first place? that's the part that piques what interest we would have in such a film. just because he wasn't a goody-two-shoes doesn't mean we have to hate his guts, does it?
(to say nothing of the fact that we all have our less appealling attributes. let he who is without character faults cast the first stone!)
another move that does more harm than good is frequent interspersing of archive footage of the bonafide Lennon. Eccleston may manage to make himself look Lennon-esque, but he's hardly such a clone that you'd ever confuse the two. so that technique only serves to confuse the viewer.
there's only one thing that makes this production worth your time, and that is Eccleston's truly mesmerizing performance. he actually manages to make you forget, albeit fleetingly, that he was The Doctor. and since it was DOCTOR WHO that finally put Eccleston on the map, that's the acid-test right there.
it's a true masterstroke of the thespianic art, and it's a cryin' shame that Eccleston wasn't given a more respectfully objective vehicle with which to demonstrate it. this film made me feel truly lousy, even guilty, about being a Beatles fan.
also, hasn't John been pretty much biopic'd out by now? isn't it about time for Paul or Ringo get their turn?",1390867200,,3285,4.836589698046181

4231345,5,B003YOZNCE,"It was a gift to someone else so I can't tell you about the plot or cinematography or anything, but I can tell you with 99.9% assurance that Christopher Eccleston is in this film. I am pretty sure that's enough for each of the 5 stars.",1353196800,,235,4.130434782608695
4231346,2,B003YOZNCE,"I don't understand most of the decisions made about this film. The casting is peculiar and some characters don't even begin to resemble the real persons, physically or otherwise. I found it positively painful looking at the actor cast as George Harrison. The voice and accent of the Paul McCartney sounds like the Saturday morning cartoon character and consequently his speech is not only unintelligible, but I wanted to laugh every time he opened his mouth. Yoko Ono is a gentler and far more beautiful version of actual self, and Cynthia Powell is a plain, strident harridan in a very bad 60s wig. Eccleston vaguely channels a semi-creditable Lennon in some of the scenes, which is difficult given his advanced age. But it's the story trajectory and its mile markers that are least understandable to a Lennon fan or follower. One doesn't understand why the film picks an arbitrary point in early Beatlemania to start and then ends upon his move to New York. The timing of some major events in the arbitrary window into his life is a little skewed, as well. Too many of the characters and too much of the screenplay and script seems manipulated to give the Lennon character an adversary and justification for behaving badly in the ""legendary"" fashion in every scene; the Freddie Lennon (father) character is the most egregiously manipulated of all the straw men.

If it weren't for the authentic Lennon music (and a Yoko song, which might explain the pretty Yoko actress and the Lennon permissions being granted) and the interspersed clips of real events linking the filmed scenes, it would have indeed fallen apart completely.

By the way, there are apparently two versions out there, a BBC and a PBS; the latter, which I purchased, has some pointless edits for foul language.

I should have listened to the other reviewers who warned us to save our money.",1347667200,2,1858,4.854889589905363
4231347,5,B003YOZNCE,"Based on books i've read by insiders like Derek Taylor, Allastir Taylor and the like I found this movie to be downright awesome.  I am glad that someone finnaly had nevre enough to show us the side of John that we never see.  It is a well known fact that John was a very bitter man and rightfully so when you consider the very tough and sad childhood he had.  Please don't get me wrong,  I have always been a very big Beatles fan since 1964 and a big fan of all the solo efforts that have been released by all 4 of the lads and a big supporter of John's political stands.  I must say I am also a fan of Yoko's.

I have read the stories about things like John hopping Paul's fence and tossing the brick thru the window, or how he claimed to be Jesus Christ in a meeting in 3 Saville Row Office's, and if you want a better feel of how John was I recommend you read the book- Waiting on the Beatles: An Apple Scruffs Story by Carol Bedford.  She gives a first hand story of almost everything that is in this movie and she was there everyday for over 5 years.  If you don't know what an Apple Scruff is then you are not a true fan of the band.  Look it up on Wikipedia or listen to George Harrisons All Things must Pass album, he wrote a song about them as a tribute to them, George was a very big fan of the Apple Scruffs.  They even appear in the Let it Be movie and sang back up on Across the Universe and a few other song on The Beatles Album ""White Album"".

I loved this movie and recommend it highly.  Sorry if you die hard Lennon fans don't agree but as much talent as he had,  he was very rough around the edges.  I miss his music and I miss him but the truth is the truth and we can't change that.",1332892800,3,1702,3.93859649122807
4231348,2,B003YOZNCE,"Really, really disappointed with this movie. I'm pretty well- read on Lennon and a life- long fan but couldn't get into to this. History- wise, too, it focuses on some really irrelevant events and skips over other more important ones. For example, why the focus on John's dad? More Cyn! More Yoko! What about the music? I did agree with the more harsh betrayal of Lennon, as believe it or not, he is human. However, Yoko's quiet, less aggressive character was a disappointment. Their relationship seemed sudden here when John had been communicating with her since India... Some little details such as this add to the drama but take away accuracy.
Anyway, any big Beatle nerd may appreciate this as simply ""amusing."" It was fun to yell at the screen, personally.
A more normal fan will be bored and disgusted by Lennon.

Don't buy. A waste!",1325721600,,839,4.7465753424657535
4231349,4,B003YOZNCE,"I can understand why most reviewers did not care for this movie.  However, you must realize that as Oliver Stone once said about JFK, ""This is not a documentary.  This is movie making.""  No movie is 100% accurate to factual material.  If it were it would not be a movie.  It would be a documentary.  However, a movie director should have enough factual material in a movie to make everything else in it coherent.  I think writer, Robert Jones and producer/director, Edmund Coulthard do just that.  It recreates important events in Lennon's life from 1964 to 1971.  Examples are the following:  The Beatles acheiving worldwide stardom in 1964, Lennon hearing about the death of The Beatles' business manager, Brian Epstein, the making of the film, ""Magical Mystery Tour"", the divorce from Lennon's first wife, Cynthia, the love affair and marriage to his second wife, Yoko Ono, drug use, being arrested for drug possession, the breakup of The Beatles, and the decision to move from London, England to New York City.  Plus, Christopher Eccleston does a superb job as the title character; one of the best I've seen. Anyway, if you're looking for more accucurate information about the life of John Lennon, you should watch a doucumentary such as LENNONYC.  But, if you are interested in watching something about Lennon's life with dramatic elements added, you might want to give LENNON NAKED a try.",1299283200,4,1394,4.935622317596566

8409718,3,B003YOZNCE,"The aim of this movie seems to be to try to show what made John Lennon tick, and to bring out the lasting trauma of his being abandoned by his father Freddie when he was five.  To do this, we spy scenes from the life of the ""Intellectual Beatle"" from 1964 to 1971, when he abandoned his native England for New York City with second wife Yoko Ono.  Along the way, the moody artist hurts first wife Cynthia, young son Julian, his wayward dad, business and personal associates, and the other Beatles.  We experience his famous quick wit, much of which is cutting.  There is not much seen of the more lighthearted and sensitive musical and verbal artist, a man who continues to be one of the greatest figures in pop culture art, decades after his untimely death.  Christopher Eccleston, a talented actor, does his best to bring this crabbed interpretation to life.  Apparently the project was approved by Yoko Ono, dropping in as it does some actual solo recordings of John Lennon.  The movie does not build towards a notable conclusion, it just ends with the view of a jet and notation that he never went back to England.  The much better and longer NBC TV-movie ""John and Yoko: A Love Story"" (1985), produced with cooperation from Yoko Ono and featuring much Lennon music, takes them from their meeting in 1966 to his demise in 1980.  It is a more traditional Hollywood love story with their happy times as well as their trials.  That film shows more dimensions to this flawed but remarkable genius, and is overdue for a good DVD presentation with lots of extras.",1469059200,3,1561,4.602888086642599

8409721,3,B003YOZNCE,"Lennon Naked is a television biographical film focusing on the life of John Lennon between 1967 and 1971. It stars Christopher Eccleston as Lennon and was directed by Edmund Coulthard.

This biopic about John Lennon as the beloved Beatle and focuses on Lennon's life during the end of that legendary band. While Lennon comes to term with the end of this fruitful creative partnership, he falls in love with Yoko Ono and must face his long-absent father who makes an unexpected return into his life. In 1964, in the peak of Beatlemania, a reluctant John Lennon is persuaded by manager Brian Epstein to meet Freddie Lennon, the father who abandoned him seventeen years earlier, with the press in attendance. When they meet, John accuses him of abandoning him, but his father says that ""he left it up to John."" John and Brian quickly leave the meeting.

The movie jumps then to 1967, after Brian Epstein has died. The Beatles are giving a press conference about their new film, Magical Mystery Tour. John is skeptical about the film, but Paul convinces him to go through the idea. John then invites his father to his mansion to live with him. Freddie Lennon arrives and meets his grandson, Julian. The story goes up to 1971 with the final scene shows John and Yoko getting on a plane and flying away, while a text on screen reveals that after they left in 1971, they never returned after having a press conference where John and Yoko announce that they will go to New York to live.

There is something disembodied about this attempt to exploit the name, fame and commercial fruit of the iconic bad-boy songwriter. But unfortunately,there is a lot to desired of from this TV special. But nevertheless,it gives a revealing insight into John Lennon and life before and after the band and music which makes it interesting and enjoyable.",1431216000,,1829,4.763406940063091

I think if he wasn't gunned down he may have come to a place where he would become a decent guy. They totally leave out any of his good side or creativeness.
