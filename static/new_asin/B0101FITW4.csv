8721254,5,B0101FITW4,I call Greg Page the modern Mr. Rogers.  He has such charisma with children.  He is a certified preschool teacher and a talented musician and entertainer all rolled into one person.  I preferred him with the Wiggles with his pals but this is great too for young children.,1453939200,,271,4.604166666666667
