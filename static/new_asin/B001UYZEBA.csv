3818598,5,B001UYZEBA,"It was a good DVD . When I received the package it was nicely packed . Nothing was missing, it was clearly new just as it was said to be . I know it wasn't the seller's fault, but what I didn't like about the DVD was one episode in season 2, the last one, because the subtitles were completely wrong, however it was lucky as I have memorized those phrases .

Diamond is a really good person to have business with : )",1242864000,9,416,3.9523809523809526
3818619,4,B001UYZEBA,"One of my all time favorites, but the title says it all.  The actors and story are cliche, but that's what makes it great, in my eyes.  If only the production value were a bit higher.  The translation isn't the best either.",1326499200,,223,4.261904761904762
3818620,4,B001UYZEBA,"This was a gift purchase for my daughter.  After hearing about it for a few weeks, the rest of the family decided to  watch it.  We were all so interested that we watched one disc after another and ended up finishing the series in 2 days! This series really pulls you in and makes you feel invested in the story.  It was not difficult to get past the language difference.  Having some knowledge of the storyline helped, but probably was not necessary for watching this drama.  In the end, you will wish there were more pieces of the series as it ended with possibilities for more.",1326153600,,580,4.4245283018867925
3818621,5,B001UYZEBA,Recieved product ontime with no damage. Would definetely buy from this seller again. For those of you who have not seen this series. This is one of my favorite drama. I would definetely recommend this movie to anyone who loves drama.,1314662400,,233,4.7073170731707314
3818622,4,B001UYZEBA,"I found this to be a nice, engaging production with very good acting by most of the cast. I saw a few episodes online, but was quickly sucked in and had to order all of the dvds so that I could finish them back-to-back. The show's tone had a dramatic bent--at times a little too serious/realistic to be comfortable, but what do you really expect when the story focuses on the teen years? There is a lot of subtext that the thinking/older/mature viewer will notice while watching the show, and I almost enjoyed that more than the ""real"" storyline. The characters were behaving and reacting to situations in ways that they were too young to fully comprehend, and the adults were interacting with them according to a better understanding of the world. It did have a definite comic angle at times, but MUCH less cheesy and bizarre than Boys Over Flowers (Korean version); I think it was necessary in order to balance some pretty serious situations and subject matter that the show addresses. Age-wise, it's definitely not for kids, and is better suited for teens and adults. I found it to be surprisingly chaste, which was quite a contrast to the physical violence, severe bullying and peer pressure aspect, downright maliciousness of a couple of characters, saving someone from what could have been a rape, and even F-bombs in episodes with English speakers. They also occasionally use other English curse words, if you catch the subtitles or mispronunciations.

Boys Over Flowers (Korean) is really hard for me to buy into, but this version is more believable. The Japanese girl is pretty, quiet, and more of a bookworm. She is very intelligent and determined, and it is hard not to respect her. I get it that the Korean one is supposed to be plucky, but i found their approach made her too goofy and vulgar (especially the way she eats). This one, at least, has enough class to make an upper-crust guy feel ok when taking out in public.

That being said, I obviously enjoyed the series a lot (though the movie is more of a tv movie finale designed to be over-the-top and have a message). They chose to wrap up some of the story lines very neatly and as you would expect, while others were more realistically left open-ended. I highly recommend it.",1313539200,9,2246,4.697969543147208
3818623,3,B001UYZEBA,"Pro: The item I ordered arrived as said in a timly fashion. Everything looked great.

Con: For some reason the DVD would skip chapters. Sometimes it froze and I had to start over, but even doing so it would freeze. I thought it could be the dvd, it looked fine so I played the DVDs on a different laptop and still froze. Finally I got it to work on a different computer. I don't know if the DVDs were acting funny or if my computer was...I ended up not being able to see one of the chapters. I havn't finished all the DVDs but I hope it won't freeze or skip again....

Over all I probably won't buy DVDs/Movies online again. Safer to just do other items instead.",1306454400,,662,4.1640625
3818624,5,B001UYZEBA,If you like great drama the this series is for you. Is a 100% better than the anime. You will not be dissapointed in this one,1298419200,,125,3.8461538461538463
3818625,4,B001UYZEBA,"This DVD set is of good quality and sound. My only problem was with the subtitles. The subtitles were OK on the first DVD but on the the Second and Final Movie Discs; they were horrible. Because I've been studying Japanese for a while, I could figure out what was being said. The subtitles seem to just be messy translations, misspelled words, or words that weren't even being said. Other than that, I enjoy them.",1291334400,14,413,4.52
3818626,4,B001UYZEBA,"Love it love it love it!  This is the first japanese drama i've purchased and it was a great choice.  The female lead actress does a fantastic job!  Doumyouji is a little silly but otherwise great story, good soundtrack.  The subtitles can get a little erratic on some episodes but would buy it again if I had been given a second chance!",1281052800,,337,4.387096774193548
3818627,5,B001UYZEBA,I brought this DVD series for my girlfriend and she absolutely loves it.  The package came super fast and was in great condition.,1280016000,,129,4.608695652173913

8345392,5,B001UYZEBA,I love the movie and the episodes but the subtitles got me a little mix up well i still love it.,1391472000,,96,3.619047619047619
8345393,4,B001UYZEBA,The order came on time and was as described. There were some misspellings with the subtitles but it was pretty easy to follow what was going on and the subtitles were still readable. If you like the Hana Yori Dango anime and manga you will definitely like the drama. It's definitely worth buying.,1383696000,,296,4.60377358490566
8345394,5,B001UYZEBA,"I'm glad that I took a chance & bought this series & the movie. It's got just the right amount of funny & drama. If you are going to get the series, try to get this pack so you can get the whole thing.",1375574400,,201,3.590909090909091
8345395,5,B001UYZEBA,"I've seen this film while it was on and the quality was good, some translation can be changed up but it's good",1375228800,,110,4.045454545454546
8345396,5,B001UYZEBA,"Today I got my order in the mail, when I opened it; I was and still am super excited...though earlier I read (and now am reading again) the title. I didn't know it said 2 of each, so when I got it I was confused; but still...AWESOME!!",1361232000,,234,4.0
8345397,2,B001UYZEBA,"Season 1 & 2 had a major problem which I had to fix by copying the discs onto my computer.  Most if not all of the Season I & 2 discs were warped and wouldn't play in my DVD player.  I submitted a claim to Amazon for a refund.  I got a form letter response from Amazon and no response at all from the seller.  If someone hadn't told me to try copying the discs, I would have been totally out of luck since I didn't get a refund or replacement.

I bought this because I'd seen most of the series online.  I fell in love with Kdrama first by watching the Korean version, Boys Over Flowers.  I saw a clip of the Japanese HYD online and was hooked.  I saw most of the episodes online and the Japanese version is better in every way.  However, this set has some inconsistencies you should be aware of.  First I had no problem with the subbing in episodes Season 1.  There were small errors that did not take away from the overall feel and meaning.  I only noticed them because I'd seen all 9 episodes of Season 1 first online.  I could not find all of Season 2 (with eng subs) online.  Many had been removed due to copyright infringement.  However, you don't need to see any episodes to know that Season 2 is a bad bootleg fan sub.  The person subbing doesn't seem to have a working knowledge of Korean & English.  The subbing is awful & a major distraction, especially in some of the most poignant scenes.  The Final movie is mostly okay.  However, I don't think it's the directors cut which I saw in its entirety online.  That said, not much is missing and it's good.  So buy this if you are okay with Season 2 being difficult to watch due to bad subbing.

I've since bought the set that contains Season 2 only.  It's a 3 disc set with just Season 2 content.  I just checked my favorite scene and the subbing is excellent.  Yeah!  Now I feel I have a complete set.",1360022400,,1861,4.171830985915493
8345398,5,B001UYZEBA,"A friend of mine introduced me to this movie. At first I was reluctant to watch a Japanese drama, but after the first 2 episodes I was hooked. Yes, the subtitles are not the best, some of the translations are off, and there are miss spelled words, but even so it is a fabulous series. It is packed full of humor that, at times is down right hilarious, emotional highs and lows,  and the acting is good enough that even without proper subtitles you can easily tell what is going on in the story. I had my mom watch it with me (she is near 60) and she loved it so much that she also wanted a copy which I got her for her birthday. I really cannot say enough about this movie. It is so much fun and I recommend it for anyone who loves a good foreign film, loves to laugh or cry, likes romance, and wants to have a great time. Enjoy!",1357862400,,829,4.024242424242424
8345399,2,B001UYZEBA,"I just finished watching the second season...the english subtitles were so awful that I couldn't understand what they were talking about half the time. It was very disappointing. I'm planning on returning them to hopefully find a version with audio and video quality that doesn't look like it was ripped off the internet and subbed by an idiot.  All that aside I've always loved this show I highly recommend it, just don't buy it from here.",1351728000,,440,4.7894736842105265
8345400,4,B001UYZEBA,"I've seen the series twice online and after a while I got tired of the ads, so I decided to buy the DVDs. The subs were fine until I hit the last episode. The names weren't correct and the grammar was horrible--so much so that I could not understand it. I remember getting to an episode or two in the second season where a notice displayed during the intro ""This is a free fansub available at xxxxxx.com. This is not to be sold or redistributed."" That was the point when I felt, ""Well, I could have bought blank DVDs and ripped them offline. I just wasted 30 dollars..."" Especially since the subs I watched online explained Tsukasa's kanji reading errors that might not be so obvious to english-speakers.

TL;DR:: The series is amazing, but given a second chance I would not re-buy this particular set due to the poor subbing and obviousness of the bootlegging.",1347494400,,861,4.554838709677419
