5555749,3,B00B4MMP9W,"I have the film 'shock labrynth"" on 3d blu ray and about half the scenes in the film have double images. the 3d is full of problems , As this is the related to that film: I was worried that it would also be full of issues. It's not, the 3d only rarely double images in this one. In fact the 3d is mostly outstanding and any movie shot in 3d , looks much better than those that are converted to 3d later. That was a relief, so you can buy this one and have lots of great 3d viewing here for he most part.  In fact , this one does have bubbles and staircases etc that are very much startling to watch. And the ending was shocking and explosive in 3d.  The film was also called 'rabbit horror' in Japan, because rabbits are everywhere in this one. And the story does make sense completely. At first a young boy is haunted by a giant rabbit suited ghost, who is his mothers, his sister also  see's the ghost. Then the story expands and we find out who is really being haunted. It's a decent horror film that is more psychological than the directors past films like 'the grudge"" and others. There is this guy who reviews 3d movies on how much things pop out at you. which is wrong of course as most 3d is about depth and not that , but he would find lots of those scenes in this one.  This movie does have a plot , and it made much more sense to me than shock labyrinth"" did , in fact in one scene they are watching that movie in this one!. And 875 of the 3d scenes look great. So it's worth it on that level too.",1379808000,,1508,4.0
5555750,3,B00B4MMP9W,Story wasn't as scary as I expected and the 3D effects don't compare with the likes of Dredd or Avatar.  This is a case of letting myself be influenced by the other reviews.  Rent before you buy.,1379203200,,195,4.243243243243243
5555751,4,B00B4MMP9W,"Being a film student and a big fan of Takashi Shimizu's work with my favorites being ""Ju-on 2"", ""Marebito"" and now ""Tormented 3D"" aka ""Rabbit Horror 3D"", I was very disappointed in his film ""Shock Labyrinth 3D"". I was concerned that he was going mainstream and lost his edge like the Pang Bros. and M. Night Shyamalan have. Being a graduate of Psychology and Social Sciences, I was enthralled by this film. The film is loaded with psychological aspects and is one big case study of a tortured protagonist. You would think that someone walking around in a rabbit suit would be a ridiculous and rubbish but this is not the case with this film. The film is very haunting and disturbing at times. There are also a couple of very scary scenes that will stay with you for a while. The blu-ray has a nice transfer and the audio is good and boasts a haunting score by musical genius Kenji Kawai (who has done soundtracks for films like: ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence"", ""Death Note"", ""Death Note: The Last Name"", ""L: Change the World"", ""Ip Man"", ""Sadako 3D"", ""Gantz"", ""Gantz: Perfect Answer"", ""The Incite Mill"", ""Avalon"", ""Ringu 2"", ""The Princess Blade"", ""Dark Water"", ""Premonition"", ""Assault Girls"", ""Reincarnation"", ""The Sky Crawlers"" and many more). I highly recommend ""Tormented 3D"". Mr. Shimizu, you have restored my faith.",1371168000,2,1344,4.822510822510822
5555752,4,B00B4MMP9W,"Japanese horror is a lot of fun, although it can be an acquired taste.  Some folks find it too quirky, since the Japanese culture has different views on society and what scares them.  Others find it too nonsensical.  But for me, I love it.  These films usually hit on something primal, a deeply ingrained nerve that gives everyone an uneasy feeling, regardless of race.  TORMENTED is one of those films.  Deeply rooted in psychological fears, this film will haunt you long after it is over.

Last summer, long before my blog crashed, I reviewed another one of Takashi Shimizu's films titled SHOCK LABYRINTH 3D.  I had mixed feelings on that particular film because, although it was shot well and had a nice chill to it, the storyline was sketchy and didn't make sense in certain parts.  This is important for TORMENTED because the film pulls from SHOCK LABYRINTH in a few different ways.

Let me explain:  the characters in TORMENTED go to a movie theater and see SHOCK LABYRINTH in 3D...which is where the rabbit comes from.  It literally flies out of the picture and into their world.  Sound crazy?  Trust me...it is...but it is really cool.  This ""tie-in"" runs throughout the film as well, even taking the characters to the hospital in which the previous movie was set.

But TORMENTED is not a sequel, nor is it technically related to the other film.  It just relies on SHOCK LABYRINTH a bit to give it some plot-plugs.  I really like how Shimizu was able to pull this off; if it were done any other way, it would have been cheesy.

TORMENTED is shot very well with some eye-popping 3D effects.  The acting is really good as well, with a well-rounded cast that gives great performances.  There's even a bit of good looking gore (although it is very brief) for you gore-hounds out there.

This film is a wide-eyed win for me and I suggest checking it out.  It has an awesome twist that I didn't see coming and some spellbinding 3D for total immersion.  The film hit store shelves earlier this week, so give it a look.",1365120000,8,2019,4.591036414565826
5555753,4,B00B4MMP9W,"Shimizu dipped out of his realm of creepy and scary to focus more on a horror-esque fantasy adventure that is literally connected to his previous film Shock Labyrinth 3d. I personally enjoyed the film and if you are a long running Shimizu fan, there should be a great movie waiting here for you. I wasn't a HUGE fan of Shock Labyrinth, but I thought this was much better. Also the two leads, and the kid were all great. Chris Doyle (a once Wong Kar Wai regular) acts a cinematographer for this film, and it shows. Quite appealing to look at. If you are looking for a more Ju-On style film, look elsewhere. This is quite different from his previous works.

I'd give it a 3.5/5",1364428800,3,675,4.4
5555754,4,B00B4MMP9W,"My first exposure to the films of Takashi Shimizu was ""Ju-on: The Grudge."" I remember seeing it and literally gripping my armchair in horror while hoping the freaky dead lady crawling down the stairs wouldn't find a way out of my television to get me. I also remember thinking to myself, ""Why can't Americans make horror flicks like this?""

When I received an e-mail that Shimizu was going to be in town promoting his new movie ""Tormented 3D"" for the Dallas International Film Festival (DIFF), you better believe I jumped at the opportunity to interview him and see it in a rare theatrical screening. I was blown away by the twisted tale that unraveled in front of me. I knew there was so much going on that I would need to see the movie again. Thanks to Well Go USA, I got the chance with its release on Blu-ray.

After seeing a 3D horror movie featuring a stuffed white rabbit, siblings Kiriko and Daigo begin seeing it in a life-sized form. The giant creature stalks them and seems to be trying to tell them something. What is the rabbit attempting to communicate to them and what sort of psychological doorways will it open?

Director Shimizu told me ""Tormented 3D"" was a companion piece to his film ""The Shock Labyrinth 3D."" I never realized how much it relied on ""The Shock Labyrinth 3D"" until I saw it again. It's basically the trigger for all the misery Daigo and Kiriko suffer through in this movie. It's the proverbial key that unlocks the dark recesses of their minds.

I know the idea of a giant white bunny rabbit running around grabbing people and stalking them might sound absurd. Trust me when I tell you, Shimizu takes the seemingly goofy concept and twists it around in your psyche to the extent that you'll never want to participate in an Easter Egg Hunt or read the story of Peter Cottontail ever again.

A lack of special features for the Blu-ray release of ""Tormented 3D"" is tragic. A 3D version of the movie and a trailer is all that's included. If you get the chance to see the movie in 3D, you should do so. Shimizu told the audience at the screening I attended he preferred everyone see it that way. I expected a ""Making of"" featurette since ""The Shock Labyrinth 3D"" Blu-ray had one. I was disappointed not to find one.

If you love Asian cinema, ""Tormented 3D"" is an essential addition to your collection. It's not likely you'll only watch the film once, as it takes several viewings to truly take everything in that it offers visually. This is so much more than a typical horror film and offers an emotional journey as well as a thrill ride.

""Tormented 3D"" is available now on Blu-ray and DVD.",1363996800,3,2622,4.530655391120507

8562455,5,B00B4MMP9W,"I loved this movie.  The storyline was unique and frankly.. FREAKY.  I bought it primarily for the interest in 3D effects.  I have a hard time finding a large selection of 3D movies.  In my opinion this movie had the BEST 3D effects I've seen to date.  We watched this last night using our 3D home theatre system and the effects amazed us.  There were scenes where you literally felt objects were floating right in front of you.  The raindrops, feathers and the rabbit were amazing.  If you like 3D this movie won't disappoint.  We were glad we didn't have dreams about it last night though. :)",1420156800,3,594,4.4766355140186915

8562458,4,B00B4MMP9W,"You know, after seeing ""Shock Labyrinth"" (2009) I thought Takashi Shimizu was losing it. Sure, it was only one movie, but it was a really lame movie that felt like amateur hour. Most fortunately, Shimizu rebounds nicely with ""Rabbit Horror."" A young mute woman (Hikari Mitsushima, arguably Japan's best young actress) and her little brother experience nightmarish visions involving a large rabbit. While there's nothing particularly scary here, the horror imagery is creative and fun to watch (there is an emphasis on dream logic, various ""forms"" of rabbits, an amusement park, and a nifty spiral staircase). The psychological elements are nothing new, but they unfold nicely and are engaging. Ironically, this has certain similarities to ""Shock Labyrinth"" but does everything a lot better. At only 83 minutes this is a cool movie that flies right by.

By the way, the highly acclaimed Christopher Doyle (In the Mood for Love, Hero, Green Tea) is the cinematographer, so that helps too.

Some other recent Japanese horror films that I recommend are ""Lesson of the Evil"" (2012), ""Cult"" (2013), ""The Complex"" (2013), ""Kotsutsubo"" (2011), all four of the ""Kaidan Horror Classics"" (2010) films, and all four of Koji Shiraishi's ""Senritsu Kaiki File"" (2012-2013) films.",1393977600,,1264,5.2835820895522385
