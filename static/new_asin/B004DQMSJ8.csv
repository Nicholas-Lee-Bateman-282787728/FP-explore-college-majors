8425876,3,B004DQMSJ8,"This is actually a good Dishum Dishum Bollywood thriller. 7/10  IMDb score which is about right for this movie. directed by Priyadarshan. The film has Ajay Devgan, Akshaye Khanna, Bipasha Basu, Paresh Rawal and Reema Sen in the lead roles. The movie does have few fight scenes and CBI running around building tops chasing bad guys etc. The core story is good that's what keeps you glued to the screen. Overall I would say a rather nice Dishum Dishoom Bollywood Thriller! It has a dark side too about honor-killing in the villages of India.

Apart from the leading hero(s) (Ajay Devgan, Akshaye Khanna) , Paresh Rawal's character of IPS Ajashatru Singh is portrayed rather nicely.

Worthy of a watch may be two at most... rating with three stars!",1528761600,,745,4.8046875

8425880,4,B004DQMSJ8,"I had the opportunity to see this film for the first time on a trip to India.  I must agree with the other critics to date.  It is a wonderful, action pact thriller.  Although it did follow Mississippi Burining in some respects, I think it distinguished itself from the American film that covered similarly difficult topics of blind hatred, prejudice, and corruption. When I first saw the film, the similarities actually helped me to understand the significance of some of the symbolism. For example, I could easily relate the flaming tridant to the flaming cross of the klan.  Far from a hinderance, for me the hommage helped me to better understand the characters and the utter terror in which the villagers lived.",1325721600,,716,4.844262295081967
8425881,3,B004DQMSJ8,"Honor killings have gained in not only the number of atrocities committed but also a greater awareness in the media. Thus films are no exception and not immune to fictionalizing a serious event. Priyadarshan is the director and he takes respite from directing comedies to direct this social thrillers.  The script is a direct inspiration from the film `Mississippi Burning' but has been indianised.
A gruesome murder of a couple of boys takes place in the remote village of Jhanjhar. Increased media scrutiny and investigatory roadblocks placed by the police, prompts the government to send in two CBI officers, Ajay Devgan and Akshaye Khanna. The rest of the film is devoted to the investigation and the closure.
This is not a bad film simple because the actors and the actors are at their professional best. Ajay Devgan, Akshaye Khanna  Why don't  we see enough of this fine actor) Paresh Rawal and a host of other supporting cast all deliver their lines and try to outmatch each other. Bipasha Basu does not have much to do but look pretty without makeup. Raima Sen tries to act and gets a decisive scene but otherwise is unrecognizable.
I felt that the scripting could have been a bit stronger and the editing could have cut the length by a bit. Still, this is not a bad movie and is fairly engaging. If you want the best film on honor killings, I still recommend Love, Sex Aur Dhokha. Three stars. 9/27/2011",1317859200,,1412,4.7317073170731705
8425882,3,B004DQMSJ8,"I have to give the makers of Aakrosh credit for tackling a very difficult subject - honour killings.

As for the movie, it is a bit of a copy of Mississippi Burning and even lifts some scenes directly.

Why Bollywood film makers insist on copying ideas shot for shot, I will never understand and this is something that affects the film. If the film makers would only be original rather than copying the Bourne films (and others) then maybe this film and others would be more original and more entertaining.",1307404800,,506,4.611111111111111
8425883,3,B004DQMSJ8,"Aakrsoh is really hard core and hard hitting movie, it's dark and captivating. The movie presents the right cover up stories behind the honor killings. Aakrosh, most of the times become heavy and dramatic. Still it's a great attempt by Priya Darshan. Ajay Devgan again proves why people love him both in comedy and hard hitting cinema. He again brought a great social subject with utmost decency to on screen.

Akshaye khanna, well I don't like his shouting in every other sequence, he seems like doing the same shouting in comedy, action or dramatic movies. Bipasha Basu is first rate and amazing as Paresh Rawal's victim wife. She really excels in every movie from comedy to hardcore cinema. Reema Sen is first class, for a single second she didn't look like a heroine she was so much in her character and whatever happened to Bipasha Basu and Reema Sen was pretty horrible in the movie. Paresh Rawal is outstanding, he is the king of comedies and villains too, another great performance by Mr. Paresh Rawal.
Sameera Reddy's Hot item song was really fun to watch. Overall, a good hard hitting movie which is quite suspenseful and hardcore.",1300579200,,1141,4.791878172588833
