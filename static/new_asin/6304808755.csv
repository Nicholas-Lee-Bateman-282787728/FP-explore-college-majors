7877250,3,6304808755,"I got this product for 70% off, which means I spent about $20 for all 3 videos.  So far I have only watched half of one of them---True North.  But even so, if I could return them and get my money back, I would.  Because even though I have a super high-end, brand new technology 60 inch HD screen with the most pixels you can get for under $8,000, the visuals were fuzzy.  Hazy, at times.  I was expecting visuals that stunned me---as good as a new mac screen---not even close. Yes, In some cases the colors (of the sunsets, for example), were vibrant and breath-taking, but in many cases the colors seemed mundane, washed out.  And if you don't like Tangerine Dream you won't like the music either.  I wasn't familiar with Tangerine Dream and I'm not a giant fan now. The reason I got it was because I'm a massage therapist and a tantrika---I like to bliss out on different kinds of sensory stimuli, and offer that to my cleints as well and I wanted something that felt like watching the most gorgeous creations God had ever inveted against angelic, hypnotic, ambient sounds that swept my mind into another world.  This music was highly charged and spirited at times but no part of it came close to sweeping me away.  At one point it sounded like a track you might hear in a high-end porn film... not terrible, just not wonderful.  I dunno, for the price I thought it should be magnificient and spellbinding and make me want to cry.  As it is, I doublt if I'll even bother to open the other two dvds.  My advice to you is, if you have to have it, don't pay $49.99.  $6.99 would be good.  And don't buy it unless you love Tangerine Dream.",1155772800,,1637,4.342105263157895
