3726364,5,B001O3M370,My 5 year old daughter owns every single Barbie movie so this was a no brainer.  She loved it and I enjoyed it as well.  I have no complaints about any of the barbie movies.  This was a very well done movie.,1237507200,2,207,3.880952380952381
3726365,2,B001O3M370,"I tried to look for any reviews befor buying this DVD, but found none. I was weary of buying it without reading any reviews, but figured it was worth a shot...however I regret buying it and will probably pass it along to a friend who wants it. I watched it with my 3 and 4 year old daughters today. The girls in the movie are rich snobs who are always competing with eachother to get the better ""thing"". One of the girl's dad buys her an island named after her, and then the main character teases her about being the last person in the world to have an island named after her. They go back and forth the whole movie about trying to impress eachother with their newer, better acquisition. McKenna and her friend Violet have severe attitude problems and their speech is dripping with contempt and superiority each time they talk to eachother.

Overall the message is good...McKenna changes her tune and befriends Thumbelina (who is small but brave and is a hero in her own right). Barbie wraps up the story by reminding her group of kids that even the smallest person/tree can make a big difference. But the snobby interaction between the friends and the emphasis on impressing eachother is just not something I want my girls to watch over and over. Just my thoughts......",1237420800,10,1270,4.5701754385964914

3726387,5,B001O3M370,"My eight-year-old insisted that I watch this with her, even though she has already seen it 3 times! Having just done so, I can say the following: 1) The presence of snobby attitudes in the girls was essential to the plot. In any good plot, a character undergoes a transformation. In this plot, the girl McKenna starts out as snobby and materialistic, always competing with her ""friend"" in trying to impress her with a fancy brand of handbag etc. but she learns from Thumbelina that there are other things that matter in life than the latest fashions. She realizes over the course of the movie that the other girl is not a true friend while Thumbelina is because Thumbelina really cares about her as a person while the false friend only cares about one-upping her. McKenna goes from only caring about brand names to caring about the environment. 2) There is no bad language in this movie, including the language used by the superficial girls. It is the typical language used by bored superficial affluent kids. 3) The environmental message IS strong. The movie conveys a clear message that fascination and awe of nature is a far more rewarding pastime than caring about the latest styles and trying to one-up your friends by having the latest exclusive fashion. Conclusion: One would think that Barbie movies would be superficial but this one actually has some depth, and a worthwhile message. It reminded both of us of the ""Dophin Cruise"" episode of Lego Friends where the main character gets fired up about saving the habitat of the dolphins. One last thing: the animation was high quality, especially the vivid beautiful portrayals of nature.",1458864000,,1644,4.854092526690391

I applaud their good message with being 'green'. But overall the movie was disappointing. I saw it once when it first came out and never watched again. Plus I don't like the way Thumbelina looked and her voice! argh! The DVD cover is also misleading as her hair is not even down at all during the film, it's always up.

They should've stuck to the traditional fairy tales. Which I miss and love",1322352000,,559,4.480392156862745

3726496,1,B001O3M370,"When I heard Barbie Thumbelina was coming out, I thought, ""Cool, I love that fairy tale!""  When I saw the review, I thought, ""What???""  When my younger sister got this movie and we watched it, I was only disappointed further.  While entertaining, this movie was just NOT GOOD!  It's the story of a fairy named Thumbelina, who gets captured by a snobby rich girl named Makenna whose parents don't have time for her.  They become friends, and find out that the land the baby fairies are going to be born on is being developed by the big bad (not wolf) construction workers...and Makenna's dad.  Thumbelina and Makenna join forces to save the fairies, and eventually succeed.  But even though this story is about saving fairies, not minnows or whales, its themes are very liberal.  It enrages me that politics is creeping into children's programs!  The whole theme is GO GREEN! and  IT'S OK TO BE A SNOB, BECAUSE YOU CAN STILL HAVE FRIENDS!  These aren't values you want taught to your children!  Barbie needs to go back to the princess movies about love and imagination and leave liberalism alone!  Kids are going to start believing that an ordinary life is harebrained parents that care more about their Blackberries than their children!
  I didn't even mention that the animation of this movie is terrible and the dialogue is extremely cheesy.  And I think I forgot to add that Makenna only gets her parents' attention by HIDING THEIR CELL PHONES!

3726504,3,B001O3M370,"I always gave the Barbie movies wide berth before, but I watched Barbie in a Christmas Carol last December and thought it was a lot better than I anticipated so I decided to try another film in the series. I picked Thumbelina because there is no Disney version to compare it to and I have always enjoyed that story. What I did not realize (as I didn't really read the description of the movie on Netflix) is that this version has nothing to do with the fairy tale of Thumbelina. There is a little Twillerbee (why they couldn't just call them fairies and leave them at that, I will never know!) named Thumbelina in the story, but that is all this version really has in common with the traditional Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. Instead of being the story of an abnormally small girl who finds her way to live with the fairies, this version is about a couple of spoiled brats who are given everything by their parents -- including a flower patch with some Twillerbees hiding inside the flowers. It was kind of hard to enjoy the film with such horrible little girls playing the lead human roles, even if Thumbelina does teach one of them to be much better behaved by the end of the story.

I did notice that both movies have one thing in common: Barbie plays narrator while telling the children a story. This gets a little bit old as you just get into the story and then you have to pop out to Barbie responding to comments from the children she is with. While the movie was a little plasticky -- I know, I know horrible description, but really, oh so true -- in that the characters aren't really animated to look like real people, the colors were bright & eye catching and the animals were pretty cute. In fact, the pet dog owned by Makena was one of my favorite characters. He is one of those little yippy dogs who thinks that he rules the world and gets outsmarted by the Twillerbees quite often, which was awesome to see. The construction workers were a hoot, too! The plants are very fake looking, though, especially the trees and bushes.

Young children, particularly girls will enjoy this short Barbie feature. I didn't think it was too bad, but there is not a lot of storyline involved so it didn't really hold my attention. Tinker Bell was so much cuter that, if you are going to buy one, I would highly recommend getting that one instead as it is much more entertaining for the whole family -- my nephews really like Tinker Bell -- but wouldn't be caught dead watching anything that says Barbie in the title!",1274745600,,2520,4.4523809523809526

So I was expecting the same from Thumbalina movie...as I loved the Thumbalina story when I was young. Well, I was wrong!
First, this movie has nothing to do with the original Thumbalina...except for the name and it's a fairy. Second, this movie did not display the type of behavior I want my young lady watching. The girl in the movie is portrayed as a ""spoiled Rich Brat"" , who's parents give her anything she wants. They zone in on the fact that the girl and her two friends are very into high fashion...and have competition on who has the newest Name Brand Fashion item ( and I am not talking on the lines of Guess....rather Gucci). I find it very annoying that Barbie would want to expose young girls to this. Now, in their defense, Thumbalina helps turn the bratty girl into caring about the forest...but seriously they spent so much time showing the bratty rich snobby girls judging each other so much...I felt the damage was already done. I could see this movie may be better for 13 age - as they are aware of cliches, and catty girls. Now the enviromental message in this movie is not a strong one. You could teach your child more, by planting a tree or garden. The sad part is that this dvd is literally going in the trash. I don't even want to recycle it.",1242950400,20,1495,4.304964539007092

3726533,3,B001O3M370,"This movie is drastically different from the other Barbie movies.  They are trying to do their good deed by making a movie with an environmental message.  This appears to be a calculated move from a marketing standpoint, rather than genuine concern for the environment since the only effort Mattel has made is with the items associated with this movie (recylced packaging for the toys, etc.).  Nothing makes blatant commercialism stand out like a sore thumb like trying to package it as anti-commercialism.  We all know that the Barbie movies are commercials for their toys (like the TV cartoons we grew up with), but as parents we've tolerated it with the Barbie movies because they've so far done alright at putting good moral lessons into them and making them relatively entertaining.  This movie is not on the same level as the previous movies in a few ways.  The writing, particularly in the dialog department, is very weak and stilted.  They have built everything around their obviously half-hearted attempt at ""doing a good deed for the environment"" and it shows in that every element involved in the ""green theme"" is poorly executed.  The dialog in these parts is atrocious, cringe-worthy jargon.  It sounds more like a cheap PSA than movie dialog.  The premise is horribly flawed that they would be trying to build a factory so far out of the way that they have to attack a field of flowers that nobody ever goes to.  That they transplant a section of the flowers from the field to Makena's room using an excavator (and apparently so quickly and cleanly that the twillerbees inside have no idea where they are or what has happened) is positively laughable.  I've had more to explain to my daughters of how things wouldn't happen the way they depicted in this movie than any other Barbie movie, and we have all but the Diaries and Fairytopia ones.

  The animation is not up to par on this movie either, and I suspect it is because they are trying to churn out more movies this year than any previous year.  They seem to have caught on that the movies are very effective at selling toys, so they're trying to hit us with a non-stop barrage.  What happens then is that they are trying to slap these things together in maybe a quarter of the amount of time they used to have.  Thus now the lifelike characters move like hollow rubber tubes, and the main characters aren't even attempted to look lifelike.  Oddly enough, they look like the Sweet Streets dolls from Fisher Price...  I also noticed several times during the movie that the image will pixellate and become grainy, so the finish is seriously lacking.  Also noteworthy is the small role Kelly Sheridan has been playing lately.  She got to mostly sit out of Mariposa, Christmas Carol, and Thumbelina and only had a starring role in the Diamond Castle movie.

  I guess I've been lucky about the brattiness of the girls in this movie, as my daughters have not tried to emulate them.  In fact the only comment I've received so far is my oldest asking ""Why doesn't she say anything other than 'Ch-ya'?"" which has given me the opportunity to point out that she doesn't have anything valuable to add so she just says something stupid.  I also point out at the end that her part was so insignificant that nobody is credited for her.  Frankly I thought the part was hillarious as a representation of the stupid things snobby people will say when they can't just be silent, but that is beside the point since I'm old enough to not be influenced by cartoons.

  All of this aside, I will say that the weird looking characters can grow on you.  Usually I like the villain characters in the Barbie movies because they tend to ham things up and totally upstage the heroic characters (particularly Martin Short's Preminger- classic!), but in this one, I think Thumbelina's ditzy friend, Chrysella steals a lot of scenes.  Also the construction workers (not counting the crazy foreman) provided a few good laughs, although they would have a hard time keeping a job with the way they spend most of their time eating lunch and smelling the flowers.  A good crew would have had the job of blading the ground done before lunch on the first day.  Poor little pixies would never have known what hit them...  All in all, the depiction of construction workers was pretty bad showing them to be lazy and more than a little weak in the head, and the foreman was the primary villain.  In that respect, the environmental message skews the story into the very turbulent waters of over-generalization.  It reminded me of a book that was just banned from the schools for trying to generalize Loggers as evil polluting critter killers.  They tried to soften it by making it only the foreman who is really trying to tear the place up, but by doing that they made doofuses out of the workers.  Way to go guys.  Some kids watching this may have parents who work in construction, or other relatives, and now they are going to have to explain to these kids that they don't go around trying to destroy pixie homes...  Does it also need to be pointed out that there is plenty of good that can be said in favor of green practices and environmental causes without having to involve magic and make-believe situations (which only dillute the message)?  Since there aren't any pixies in the homeless shelters, trying to save their habitat is kind of pointless, you think?

  This movie is mildly amusing and my daughters enjoy it immensely, but I think it has the worst dumbed-down plot of all of them.  The parts about understanding what true friendship is are good, and that goes back to what most of the Barbie movies are good at, self-esteem stories.  They need to stick to those motifs if they're going to do rush jobs on these movies.

  And if you think this one was bad, the next one features four Barbies riding horses in mini-skirts waving swords around.  That ought to get all of us parents up in arms!",1240790400,22,5936,4.6477927063339735

3726542,4,B001O3M370,"First of all, this is from a 13- year- old who loves Barbie. I have seen the movies; I love 'em all. I like Thumbelina a lot, but I do have a few peeves with it.
Pros:
1. It's very different. A change from all the princess movies. Don't get me wrong! I LOVE the princess movies, but a change is always nice.
2. It inspired me to help the enviroment more.
3. The Twillerbees are very cool- I love their home!
4. It's a good story, but there isn't any scary stuff. It's hard to have a good movie without a little bit of fright, or on-the-edge-of-your-seat stuff.

Cons:
1. The animation is NOWHERE NEAR as beautiful as the older ones! It remids me of movies like Toy Story. I DID NOT like the construction Boss Myron. He looks completely unrealistic and despicable.
2. I didn't like the way the parents were portrayed as ""kiss-ups."" It's a way of undermining parents authority. Although you must understand, it's not that they are dumb slobs, but they are too busy and don't have time for their daughter. So they simply let her have whatever she wants. It's the classic ""rich kid"" case- a daughter longing for attention and getting it from her firends because it's unavailable from her parents.
3. Barbie tells the story to a redhead, brown- eyed Emma, along with a group of kids. I missed the one-on-one, heart-to-heart sister relationship between Barbie and her sisters.
4. ""Ashlyn"", Violet's friend, is SOOOO irritating!!! All she says is ""Ch-ya!"" grr....
5. I didn't like the way Thumbelina and her friends appeared to the kids at the end. I like the more mystery, where Barbie might say something like, ""Maybe..."" but you never see the fairy-tale people- so the kids are just left thinking.

Overall, I really like this movie. I have 4 pros and 5 cons, so I give it a 4 out of 5. I disagree with those who say that the rich girls are terrible. Violet is a brat the whole time, but McKenna makes a small sacrifice to help Thumbelina and learns that true friends aren't people to just impress and try to be better than. SHE LEARNS HER LESSON.
I think it's a good movie for kids, but I really miss the old animation. I miss Barbie's old face (have you noticed the change???) and I miss the old style. Other than that, it's good. Enjoy!",1238630400,8,2235,4.4487804878048784
3726543,1,B001O3M370,"In short, do not buy this movie.  We got it since it seemed similar to Tinkerbell, which our 4 year old loves (and we do too), and because of the Thumbelina name.  But ever since purchasing this movie, my 4-year old daughter is walking around the house imitating the words and tone of the rich kid snobs in this movie.  We are very careful in teaching our daughter to use nice words and to speak in a kind manner.  I winced every time I heard the dialogue - including a few choice phrases by Thumbelina.

3726545,2,B001O3M370,"I rented this DVD for my 4-year-old preschooler today and after watching it with her, I must say I'm disappointed with this production. It was a clever marketing ploy to use ""Thumbelina"" as the main title. I thought we'd get a story similar to the fairy tale but this is a far cry from the original tale. The only thing that remains is the name - Thumbelina here happens to be the main character but she belongs to a tiny race of people called the Twillerbees who live amongst the wildflowers in a big field. When Thumbelina and her friends are accidentally transported to the apartment of a spoilt rich girl Makena, they are momentarily trapped. During this period, they learn of a construction project by Makena's parents that will result in the destruction of their habitat. With some persuasion [more like a bribe - Thumbelina promises Makena that she will make stuff for Makena to impress her friend Violet], Makena tries to help the Twillerbees.

Frankly, the storyline is not captivating - the Twillerbees are an interesting idea but don't really hold much interest. They seem to possess some magic but once again, the exploration of this magic is not in-depth. The dialogue comes across as stilted and the human girls, Makena and Violet are the epitome of rich, spoilt brats. They are constantly on their cell phones talking about makeovers, and shopping and other trivial things [yes, I know tweens are into these things, but we hear enough of those in real life to have it reiterated on a kid's DVD]. The message of conservation is a good one, but this movie failed to make a positive impression, either on me or my preschooler.",1238025600,3,1638,4.7272727272727275

Tours of the nature preserve are given daily by Barbie.

That's what I was thinking, anyhow, as I watched this movie.

The girls' snobishness is one of the points of the movie.  The main character during the movie learns about true friendship, ditches her old ""friends"" as she makes friends with the twitter-people, and has a new purpose beyond shopping.  As far as Barbie movies go, it was very OK.  Not at all memorable.  Even the smallest can make a difference?  That's not such a stretch if you have pretty cool magic powers or super rich parents!

8329172,1,B001O3M370,"The earlier Barbie movies were typical re-writes of classic fairytales, and with a name like ""Barbie Presents: Thumbelina"" one would expect something at least resembling the classic Thumbelina fairytale. At least that was the hope I had when I sat down to watch this movie. Unfortunately that's not the case. I've never read the original classic Thumbelina story, however this is absolutely nothing like Don Bluth's 1994 Thumbelina movie, which is said to be based on the original classic fairytale.

Totally deceptive and a let-down in my book, to call or even pretend to call a movie 'Thumbelina' when it hasn't anything to do with the original classic 'Thumbelina' fairytale everyone knows and loves. I personally feel Barbie has let me and many other down by giving us this anti-eco-terrorist, story instead of what I was hoping for. While it's kind of a cute story about protecting the environment and all, it never should have been named Thumbelina. Call it something else, because that's what it truly is.

Barbie did a great job with other fairytale rewrites such as Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, The Princess And The Pauper, The Three Musketeers, etc. And yes, they all sorta deviated a bit from the original stories they were based on, but at least they kept much from the original tales for the basis of the plot and over-all story arc.

I WANT THUMBELINA AND HER FAIRY PRINCE. Helpful sparrows and field mice. Cheesy stupid frogs and egotistical stag beetles. Not a reboot exuding heavy eco-terrorism vibes.
