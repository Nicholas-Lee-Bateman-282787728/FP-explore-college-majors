1901201,4,B0000A2ZU4,"Finally, "" The Devil Commands"" is here on DVD. Why carp about no extras..This is a surreal excursion into the supernatural with a rather noirish blend of atmosphere.
Ann Revere adds to the excitement and at one time most folks thought that the narration was a bit tepid, however it is important and helps the film move along. This is one of Edward Dmytryks first works and its one of the best Karloff Kolumbia efforts..

1901202,4,B0000A2ZU4,"Ok so it's a lot of money to pay for a film made in 1941 with no extra's but if your a Karloff or Vintage Horror lover it's worth the money.
I thought the picture quality was good..not stunning, but as clear as watching a movie on tv.
As for the film - it's one of the most interesting Karloff made during the 30's and 40's.
But if Columbia want a big seller on their hands they'll release 'The Black Room' & 'The Man They Could Not Hang' on a double bill disc.",1063584000,15,461,3.967741935483871
1901203,4,B0000A2ZU4,"Perennial favorite Boris Karloff stars as a scientist who has created a helmet then when placed on the head of a subject can transfer their brainwaves onto a graph. Kind of like a lie detector graph. He discovers that women have stronger waves of brain energy then men. He demonstrates this to a room full of fellow scientists and friends, by using his wife an an example. Her brain waves are indeed stronger and much to the amazement of his skeptical friends the graph on the wall jumps up and down! Later after his wife dies in a car accident, Boris returns to his lab and angrily throws switches and discovers that his wife's energy has returned to the lab! He now joins up with a spiritualist and a bruteing Igor type to further his experiments and try and contact his beloved wife from beyond the grave. Holds up quite well today. The seance table surrounded by corpses, the swirling spirits appearing as a funnel of energy and King Karloff in all his maniacal glory. My only complaint is the short running time of only 65 min. The last 5 minutes look rushed but still the movie wraps up nicely. Now as to the transfer...it is just o.k. Columbia started out great with their brilliant William Castle titles, but seem to care less and less about these more recent releases. The pre-print on Devil Commands could use digital cleaning up. And come on Columbia, not even the trailor!!??. In closing, Columbia/Tristar Look at the GHOUL released by M.G.M. and see what a great transfer should look like. Still over all recommended.",1062201600,10,1530,4.649446494464945
1901204,4,B0000A2ZU4,"Karloff fans should probably be happy that this rarity, which never appeared on commercial VHS, has been made available by the original studio in the new format. As it is, this DVD is definitely worth having for the movie alone. But the price should reflect the content. On the outer packaging, we are told the film has been ""remastered in high definition"". This may be the truth, but in remastering the movie, numerous scratches and other imperfections were certainly not remedied. Fortunately, the best parts of the film (the first 20 or so minutes and the finale) do look rather fine, and there is plenty of clarity in the image along with that silvery quality that some associate with older films.
THE DEVIL COMMANDS is a low-budget production, but director Edward Dmytryk (MURDER, MY SWEET and others) knew how to establish a sinister atmosphere and sustain it for 64 minutes. This is sort of a 'haunted house meets mad scientist movie'. There are elements of science-fiction (very sketchy science) and horror (communication with the dead). The film is short and moves quickly, at less of an expense to plot development than one might think. In its own terms and within its genre, this film is quite plausible, and very enjoyable.
Karloff is extremely good at portraying a well-meaning scientist and loving husband who must gradually transform into an obsessed near-maniac. ""Near-maniac"" because he does not willfully harm anyone, but only commits ""ethical"" crimes like grave-robbing. When the doctor's wife is killed in a freak accident, he puts his new theory to work, trying to communicate with her spirit in the afterlife. There are some downright creepy moments, courtesy of Karloff's character, a tragically damaged lab assistant, and the formidable presence of Anne Revere (whose name does not appear on the DVD box cover). An actress who could achieve a facial expession that would have intimidated King Kong AND Godzilla. Revere, as Mrs. Walker, a phony medium, takes charge of Karloff and his experiments, which she sees as the key to ruling the world someday. A number of misfortunes ensue and there is a marvelous climax in the darkly-lit laboratory (involving the housekeeper, well realized by Dorothy Adams who bears an uncanny resemblance to the young Gilda Radner) that is really pretty unique. The supporting cast is fine, apart from the dullards who play Karloff's daughter and her fianc.
Apart from scene selections, the DVD contains only three trailers from recent Columbia horror films. It does not contain any trailer for THE DEVIL COMMANDS. A must for Karloff enthusiasts. It should appeal to any fan of 30s and 40s horror films.",1062115200,9,2657,5.040909090909091
1901205,5,B0000A2ZU4,"Stumbled on this movie as an adult and it truly gave me the chills.  Not even a modern movie has grabbed me like this.  Perhaps its in its plausibility.  Science combined with the occult to open a door to the dead.  The effects with the Frankenstein like machines surrounding a table of dead bodies wired together, swirling mists of ectoplasm, what more could you want?  Just one warning, don't watch this movie alone, late at night, before bed lol.  Far scarier then any blood, gore and chainsaw swinging zombies, IMHO.",1284508800,,520,4.722222222222222
1901206,5,B0000A2ZU4,"So it was about 1960,and I was just a 10-year-old boy growing up in Houston,Texas...
and watching a local weekend TV show called ""The MidNite Zone"" [sic] which featured various sci-fi and horror movies.

One of those movies REALLY made an impression on me. The legendary BORIS KARLOFF with a character involved in a mysterious experiment...a chart of brainwaves,and
a whirlpool...I was only able to watch it halfway through,being it was so late at
night...I wouldn't hear about this movie again until a few years later,when narrator
Joseph Cotten mentioned it in the documentary ""Hollywood And The Stars"": ""Boris Karloff is most at home when he's involved in a diabolic experiment!"" And they showed a clip from this movie....but WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE MOVIE??

So I emailed Sara Karloff (the actor's surviving daughter,Sara Karloff Enterprises). Her people told me about ""THE DEVIL COMMANDS""...and I bought the DVD...I just saw the movie in its entirety!! 50 years late but better
late then never.

 This is an INCREDIBLE masterpeice with astounding sophistication for such an old (1941) movie. The acting is great,the effects are fine,and the story (adapted from a book) is really disturbing. (What if a scientist could open the door to Eternity in the attempt to communicate with the dead? That could destroy the world!!) Simple story,but VERY effective,dealing with such complex issues. Black-and-white ""noir"",yes,but it drives the point home. I was surprised to find out that the music was handled by Morris Stoloff (credited as ""M. Stoloff"") later responsible for music from the 1956 movie ""Picnic"" (and notable others).

Should be required viewing for all KARLOFF fans and anybody who appreciates horror/
science fiction. (BTW,if you could only have 3 KARLOFF movies,they should be: FRANKENSTEIN,THE DEVIL COMMANDS,and YOU'LL FIND OUT (a real oddity,a horror-comedy-
musical!)",1284422400,5,1884,5.308724832214765
1901207,5,B0000A2ZU4,"Boris Karloff plays a scientist working on interpreting brainwaves. After losing his wife in a car accident, Boris delves into the realm of the supernatural, believing he can communicate w/ the dead! He teams up w/ a fake medium, accidentally creates a mute, zombie-like henchman, and moves his operation to a spooky, cliffside mansion. The bizarre experiments continue, resulting in death and doom! THE DEVIL COMMANDS is an excellent mad science yarn, loaded w/ creepy atmosphere and interesting characters. One of my favorite Boris movies...",1269648000,3,543,5.4
1901208,4,B0000A2ZU4,"When I first saw THE DEVIL COMMANDS I was quite young but had already watched my first few Shock Theaters on New York TV and was familiar with monster movies. I realized that Karloff, who portrayed the Frankenstein monster, had the starring role in this movie and somehow the role of this kindly old scientist scared me more than his great 1931 movie classic.

This film really frightened me. Naturally, I would recommend that Karloff fans purchase this DVD which I promise was a good video transfer (not perfect, but very good). The merits of this film included: a good script, fine acting, credible model work, nice sets and special effects and a very plausible tale of reliable communications with the dead established by using a combination of technology and a medium. After almost a lifetime of watching and re-watching this old film I still occasionally screen it.

The imagery of several newly robbed corpses seated in a mystic circle serving as the individual vacuum tubes of a radio like device to amplify the thoughts and reproduce the ""voice"" of a departed soul was credible and chilling.  Enlisting the aid of a medium in the circuit just seemed like the cherry on the cake. If you didn't believe in the paranormal, you had hard science teamed up with the occult arts to make for a scary and powerful alliance.  Frankly, THE DEVIL COMMANDS scared the crap out of me.

  As several fans have already written in to accurately describe the interesting story I will only mention my personal story of that New Years Eve when I first saw this movie alone. My parents had gone out for the evening so I spent the night anxiously looking forward to seeing this old film by myself. Then after seeing the film I realized all at once that I was so unnerved that I had to call up my cousin who was a couple of years older than me and speak with her just to calm down. At the time I couldn't help thinking not only was this film scary, it seemed like it might just be possible. I mean, wasn't everything possible using the right technology? That was my frame of mind that New Years Eve. I really think being alone contributed only a bit to my fear. I was already a young veteran of FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA, THE WOLFMAN, and all their sequels with no ill after effects.  The story seemed very plausible to my young mind, which made it all the more unsettling.",1213574400,3,2354,4.561611374407583
1901209,5,B0000A2ZU4,"Awesome and terror-inspiring would sum up my thoughts on this movie.  I had many a bad dream as a child growing up in the '50s and '60s after seeing this movie, and it still reaches out to grab me.  Of course, few could inspire sheer terror as Mr. Karloff could.

Not gory or bloody, but a nightmare-creating monster, nonetheless.",1188086400,2,330,4.559322033898305
1901210,3,B0000A2ZU4,"Movie: ***1/2  DVD Quality: **1/2  Extras: **1/2

A fun little ""B"" horror film from 1941 with the redoubtable Boris Karloff playing the kind of ""mad doctor"" role he could pull off with effortless aplomb.  What makes this one a notch above the  average is that Karloff is up against an unusual foil --- a scheming female medium, formidably played by the superb character actress Anne Revere (just three years away from winning her Oscar for ""National Velvet"").  Watching an unhinged Karloff and a toughly villainous Revere sparring together on-screen is a real treat, and they're given excellent support by a supporting cast that includes Amanda Duff as Karloff's daughter and wide-eyed Dorothy Adams playing another of her patented domestic roles (she is perhaps best remembered as Gene Tierney's housekeeper in the classic ""Laura"").  The main plotline is fairly cliched, with Karloff as yet another bereaved husband trying to contact his deceased wife from beyond the grave, but there are some great set decorations and moody cinematography that liven up the proceedings.  And at a mere 65 minutes of running time, director Edward Dmytryk (like Revere, an eventual victim of the Hollywood blacklist) keeps things humming along nicely.

Columbia's DVD transfer is wildly uneven.  There are sections where the video quality is superb; sadly, there are also long stretches plagued by white lines running through the frame, and some frequent spotting.  The sound is fairly good throughout.  DVD extras consist of three trailers for more recent Columbia horrors; there are no features pertaining to ""The Devil Commands"" itself.  Overall, the DVD will appeal primarily to genre fans in general, and Karloff devotees in particular.  Others may not be so appreciative of the film's charms, but there are certainly worse ways to spend an hour and five minutes.",1144108800,10,1852,5.212837837837838
1901211,3,B0000A2ZU4,"I say this one when it first came out and a few details always lingered in my mind. For 1941, this was quite a production. Boris was at the height of his powers and the story line was good. It has many of the features of the early Frankenstein films including the angry mob, the demented side-kick and the mildly deranged scientist. Someone ought to remake this with some of our current 'stars' playing the dead bodies inside the space suits.",1142035200,3,442,4.469135802469136
1901212,4,B0000A2ZU4,"A kindly, absent-minded scientist loses his wife suddenly and decides to modify his brain-wave measuring invention to communicate with his dead spouse from beyond the grave.

 THE DEVIL COMMANDS opens onto a dark and stormy night with a sad sounding woman, the Mad Scientist's daughter, providing a voice-over narration. The narrator throws us into a deep flashback where a happy Dr. Boris Karloff is showing off his new invention, a primitive electroencephlogram gadget (the EEG was developed in the 1930s, so this is relatively new technology) that features a six foot tall, wall mounted graph.  The person whose brain is being scanned is fitted with a head strap that's covered with what looks to be a deep sea diving helmet.  Dr. Julian Blair (Karloff) believes this device will help him talk to his dead wife.  As he puts it, his brain scanner will allow `controlled and scientific communication between the living and the so-called dead.'  The crowd of admiring fellow scientists are wowed by the machine, dismissive of the planned application.

  Not so the charlatan spiritual medium Mrs. Walters (Anne Revere), who may be a fraud but, more to Dr. Blair's purpose, is able to take a 10,000 volt charge with nary a murmur (`Why, it only takes 1000 volts to electrocute a man!')  Not so, either, poor, loyal Karl (Ralph Penney.) Without giving too much away, let's just say you NEVER trust Karloff when he's in Mad Scientist mode and assures you, as he's strapping on the electrodes, that `I won't let thith hurt you.'  Karloff probably believes it when he says it, too, but likely as not you'll end up mute, uncontrollably drooling and lucky if you're able to understand `Sit,' `Stay,' `Go lock the laboratory doors,' and, especially, `No, Karl. No!'  And so, with Karl and the frosty Mrs. Walters in tow Dr. Blair moves to Creepy Mansion, where he can, hopefully, continue his experiments undisturbed.

 For a short (65-minute), cheap b-movie THE DEVIL COMMANDS is eminently entertaining.  The lighting is moody, the acting (especially Karloff and Revere) is appropriately creepy, and some of the sets are brilliant.  Especially the lab at the creepy mansion, which may not have cost much but is a hoot and a half.",1128038400,4,2222,4.948787061994609
1901213,4,B0000A2ZU4,"Contrary to popular opinion, Boris Karloff actually starred in quite a few films where he wasn't made up to be some sort of grotesque monster, as in this film, The Devil Commands (1941).  Directed by Edward Dmytryk (Back to Bataan, The Caine Mutiny, Warlock), the film stars Boris Karloff (The Old Dark House, The Mummy, Bride of Frankenstein), along with Richard Fiske (The Son of Davy Crockett), Amanda Duff (Mr. Moto in Danger Island), Anne Revere (National Velvet), and Ralph Penney, in his only accredited role.

Karloff plays Dr. Julian Blair, a scientist who has been experimenting with machinery designed to record brainwaves of individuals. It seems people's brainwaves are as distinct as fingerprints, and Dr. Blair believes he is on the path to unlocking the secrets of the human brain.  After the untimely death of his wife, the grief stricken Dr. Blair stumbles across the possibility of using his machinery to talk to his dearly departed, but finds himself at odds with his colleagues and family. While visiting a woman purporting to be a spirit medium, he exposes her as a fraud, but discovers she does seem to have enhanced perceptical (I know this isn't a word as I just made it up. I contact the good people at Websters and have them include it in their next edition) abilities, and enlists her aid in helping him. Being an unsavory individual, the woman agrees to help as she thinks if the good doctor can pull off speaking with the dead, he will gain power and riches beyond belief. Dr. Julian, quitting his job at the university and selling his home, leaves with Mrs. Walters, the psychic medium, and Karl, a mute, brutish man who was injured in one of Dr. Julian's experiments, and they relocate to an isolated manor in a small town, far away from prying eyes and inquisitive minds.  Soon the villagers start to talk and get suspicious of the secretive work going on at the manor. Rumors begin to fly, and speculation runs rampant, certainly assisted with the disappearance of a few recently buried corpses. What was their purpose in Dr. Blair's experiments? You'll have to watch the movie. As the townspeople become more and more uneasy, I half expected a mob brandishing fiery torches to descend on the isolated manor. (Actually, they do, near the end.) The ending was wonderfully unsettling, and left viewers with questions never to be answered. After watching the film, I pondered the fate of Karloff's character, and the more I thought about, the more chills these thoughts gave me.

Karloff is great, as always, as the mad scientist (for lack of a better term) consumed with his quest, but he also provides us with a rich, deep characterization in that Julian feels very remorseful when his experimentation leads to the injury (Karl, who Dr. Julian now provides and cares for) or death. I thought that aspect rare in movies like this. His only intention, his desire, is to speak to his dead wife. Anne Revere is wonderful as Mrs. Walters, and her character makes no bones about what she is in it for, money...she insinuates herself into Julian's life to the point where she actually becomes a surrogate wife, taking care of all matters, allowing Julian to work unfettered, unencumbered with mundane responsibilities. She was very attractive, but in a cruel sense, as she had a gaze that could chill your blood.  One of the many things I enjoyed about this feature was attention to detail. The machinery Karloff uses, especially near the end of the movie, was exquisite and intricate. It reminded me of the machinery from Frankenstein (1931) with dials, electrodes, arcing electricity, indicators, huge, switches for the throwing...it really aiding in providing atmosphere and a real sense of creepiness. Check out the metal, iron maiden-like mask used during the experimentation. Would you let someone fix that on your noggin? I surely wouldn't. Also, the film was intelligent, and provided an atmosphere of belief. There were some very minor plot variances, but those faded quickly as I became engrossed in the Karloff's character knocking on the door of the great unknown.  The movie does get talky at times, but the pace is brisk with a 65 minute running time. The quality of the print used on this DVD is very good, but some minor blemishing is apparent, more so at the beginning. There is little in the way of special features, which is comprised of three movie trailers for current Columbia/Tristar horror films.  What I really found odd was the title and the tagline for the movie, `This mad wizard kills at will in Satan's service!' While there were some occult elements, there certainly wasn't any Satanism involved. Maybe some studio lunkhead thought the movie needed some `zing' to draw audiences in, but I think just having Karloff would have been good enough.

The full screen print (1.33:1) looks fairly clean, subject to expected and acceptable age wear.  There's not anything in the way of special features, except a few trailers for various Columbia/Tristar releases like Identity (2003), Darkness Falls (2003), and Tsui Hark's Vampire Hunters (2002).

1901214,4,B0000A2ZU4,"Boris Karloff made a series of pictures for Columbia during the late 30s and early 40s, usually playing mad scientists. This is his maddest scientist of the lot. Based (very) loosely on ""The Edge of Running Water,"" a popular story by William Sloane, the film concerns the attempts of Boris to communicate with his late, very beloved wife. To do so, he enlists the help of a medium and several stolen corpses, who are seated around a table in robotic diving helmets and subjected to huge amounts of electricity. The townspeople are growing suspicious of Boris and so he is visited by the sheriff. (Kenneth MacDonald, who later went on to star as a foil for the Three Stooges in several shorts.) The sheriff, in turn, calls Boris's long lost daughter (Amanda Duff) to come and fetch her father. But Boris decides she is perfect suited for the experiment, and so uses her to get in touch with the wife. Watch for the great scene when the maid, coaxed by the sheriff to do a little snooping, gets locked in Boris's laboratory with the seated corpses and the electricity on.

7995537,3,B0000A2ZU4,"I am such a fan of Boris Karloff I could watch him read the phone book (remember those?) His mellifluous, slightly lispy baritone is like creme brulee to my ears. Not to mention his visage so easy on the eyes. *sigh*

Yet, still. Not one of his best vehicles.

Although Karloff admirably played the mad scientist, and his partner in crime, fake medium Mrs. Walters (Ann Revere) was suitably conniving, controlling, and creepy. They're conducting brainwave experiments on the deceased in order to make their memories immortal. And in quite the steampunk / art deco lab as the backdrop!. Dr. Blair was blessed with a wonderful wife (for a scientist, or, indeed ANY man, as his colleagues deemed), who dies most unfortunately, setting things into motion. Dr. Blair becomes obsessed with ""piercing the veil"" to the other side in order to reconnect with his beloved.

Dr. B's long suffering daughter Ann (Amanda Duff) narrates the plot sympathetically and does eventually save the day. And her cardboard suitor, Dr. Sayles (Richard Fiske) did appear quite perturbed at times. The subplot of the housekeeper Mrs. Marcy (Dorothy Adams), and the outcome of, was well placed and added to the immediacy and continuity of the action. And I felt so bad for Karl (Cy Shindell), Karloff's used and abused loyal, obedient assistant.

Some of the dialog is incredible camp, and much fun. Yet overall I just couldn't buy into this rather clunky premise.
