8048266,4,B0007LHZ9G,"Once again we have the reviewer ""Grizzly"" above  who takes such an exception to the guys of OCC. And again I offer this: Dude, get over yourself. Your precious biker lifestyle is being co-opted by the mainstream, just like everything else in America, and people are inevitably going to try to make a little money off it. That's the case here. You are wasting your energy ranting about the Tuetles. When they go away ( and they will ) someone will be there to take their place. It's the American Way.

As for the DVD in question, I find it quite funny.",1120694400,,551,4.392156862745098
8048267,1,B0007LHZ9G,"Speaking on the authority of a REAL Biker who has LIVED the Lifestyle for over 35 of my almost 53 years, during which I have ridden the same '63 Harley Panhead, (which I built and rebuilt from the ground up with my own two hands), longer than the Turtle Kids have been alive, My Brothers and I all find Orange County Chumps to be some of the Funniest Comedy on DVD! Their Ol'Man is one of the greatest comedians to try and call himself a ""biker""; seemingly, the only thing that HE works at is running his MOUTH! What little I have been able to watch of this show without developing acute nausea, I have NEVER seen Turtle, Sr. EVER pick up a tool or lend a hand to help anyone at ANYTHING.
The bikes built by OCC may have some eye appeal, but are otherwise a waste of parts & labor, as they are totally unridable; you would need an entire parking lot to turn one of them around, and the spider bike in particular, with its ridiculous rear fender, would give you a radical shower if one attempted to ride it on wet pavement, much less in the rain!(And I would LOVE to know what company sells them INSURANCE!)
My Brothers and I have long debated which is more hilarious, the Turtles, with their hour long screaming matches, or the sidewalk commandos who give the mighty OCC free advertising, running around  with T-shirts & other gear, none of whom OWN, or probably even KNOW HOW to ride a MOTROCYCLE! Only Hang-arounds and Wannabees worship these comedians; REAL Bikers only LAUGH at them!
As far as other reviewers who are so critical of my well earned opinion are concerned, just read their other reviews (if they have any)!
At least Jesse James RIDES his creations to shows! The Turtles TRAILER Theirs (and then have to FLY IN their mechanics when one of their monstrosities breaks down!)",1115596800,2,1789,4.470948012232416
