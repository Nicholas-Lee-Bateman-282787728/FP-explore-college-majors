Didn't live up to expectations.
I wouldn't recommend it.  Should get more for your money.
I'm sure there are better instruction DVDs.
Very boring and amaturist.",1379289600,,170,5.071428571428571
8253012,4,B0013TO78I,"I bought this dvd for my 57 year old mother who has never before used a computer system and, in fact, thought should could break a computer just by touching it. These, along with the other dvds in this series, have now transported my computer-fearing mother into the 21st century. The dvds aren't meant to be just played in a dvd player to watch - the key is to have the person watching the dvd at an actual computer while watching the dvd. The narrator speaks extremely slowly, almost painfully slowly if you are just watching the dvd. However, the narrator expects you to be physically following along at a computer and mimicking what is being taught and in order to do that, must speak slowly so that people have enough time to follow. In all, this series is a must have for seniors who are looking to get into getting over their fears of using a computer.",1235779200,2,859,4.443037974683544
