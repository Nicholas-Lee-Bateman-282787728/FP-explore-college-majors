The government sent his father on a secret mission.  This special medal was left in a briefcase for Billy.  Billy left the academy to look for his father, but he was mugged, wallet taken and left for broke.  The FBI tells Billy that his father was looking for him.  Six months ago, Billy read in the newspaper that his father was dead.  He blames it on the coppers.  This is why Billy is so tough and has an attitude.  The FBI tells Billy that his father is alive and is being held captive by a dangerous organization, The Flaming Torch.  The Flaming Torch is trying to overthrow the present social order.  They want the formula that Admiral Barton (Russell Hicks) has.  Billy must join the Junior G-Men to help save his fathers life.  In 1940, The East Side Kids was created with Leo Gorcey and Bobby Jordan (Huntz and Dell joined later).  Billy Halop and Bernard Punsly did not join them, but continued as the Dead End Kids with The Little Tough Guys in films until 1943.
 The Dead End Kids in this film are: Billy Halop, Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell and Bernard Punsly.  Kenneth Howell plays ""Harry Trent"".  Phillip Terry plays ""Jim Bradford"".  Florence Halop (Billy's sister) plays ""Mary"", the waitress.  You might remember her in the NBC tv series ""Night Court"" in the 1980's.
 Bernard Punsly's last film was MUG TOWN (1943).  Bernard Punsly became a gynocologist M.D. in Torrence, California and recently passed away on January 20, 2004.  He was the last surviving Dead End Kid.  Huntz Hall passed away January 30, 1999.
Billy Halop said goodbye to the Dead End Kids with MUG TOWN (1943) as well.  Billy Halop continued to make films, but getting parts was hard.  In his final years, he became a male nurse.  You may remember Billy Halop as ""Bert Munson"" on the CBS tv series ""All in the Family"".  A role he played from 1972 to 1976, which ran through 1977.  Billy Halop died in 1976 of a heart attack. Suddenly his career of 50 years which started in the 1920's on radio was over. But thanks to radio CD's (Radio Spirits) and films on VHS and DVD, Billy Halop, Huntz Hall, Bernard Punsly, Gabriel Dell and the rest of the film gang will still be around to entertain us.
