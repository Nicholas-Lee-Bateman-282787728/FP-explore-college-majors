8435350,4,B004LY1ROY,"It was said that Natalie was the first 3D Korean movie.

The story was about a sculpture/ lecturer, Jun-hyuk (played by Lee Sung-jae) having an affair with his student, later became his model, and later became his lover, Mi-Ran (played by Park Hyun-jin), The movie started with the lecturer's exhibition, and the masterpiece was his sculpture. A naked woman sculpture. During the exhibition, a young man approached him. Claiming he knew the model of that sculpture. Then the story went present (conversation between the two men) and past (Jun-Hyuk, Mr-Ran, and another woman).

Natalie is full with mature content. Nudity and sex scene, ever since the opening title. The visual graphic was very beautiful and I really enjoyed it. Especially the scenes between the lecturer and the model. It was artistic. I'm sure it was simulated.

However the scenes with the lecturer and the other woman was more erotic. I'm even almost certain that the sex scenes were unsimulated. Of course it's hard to prove as the camera angle couldn't confirm it.

What about the story? The pace was slow, especially between the conversation between the lecturer and the young man. No rush throughout the whole movie. The main story was quite simple. A man and a woman attracted to each other, had frequent sex, and separated when the other couldn't committed to further relationship.

I really enjoyed the movie, and watched it many many times. Park Hyun-jin is so beautiful, photogenic and have a very proportional body.",1426204800,3,1497,5.020161290322581

8435352,4,B004LY1ROY,"One of the most visually beautiful films. The artwork displayed is appears to be of truly high (expensive) quality. The woman who is the subject matter of the film is compelling . I felt some of the scenes with the artist were over dramatized but I guess artists in general live in a ""dramatized"" world.",1404777600,3,303,4.527272727272727
