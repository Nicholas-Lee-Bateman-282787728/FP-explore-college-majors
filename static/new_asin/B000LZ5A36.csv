8165393,1,B000LZ5A36,"Sophomoric is too generous a term to describe this video.  I bought this to help train my grand children to sai..  Basic message (the only one in the video) is don't run the boat into the dock or the pilings or oh yeah another boat.  Duh?

Narrator constantly talks  about right or left handed props without explaining what either does or how to tell one from the other. I suppose you're supposed to go over the stern and check. Prop walk  and prop wash (the proper terms) are not mentioned at all.

Has several scenes backing boat out of dock--not a single mention of what rudder does or effects of backing out on rudder.  Mentions ""springs"" a couple of times, but nothing on how forward or aft springs are used for docking or undocking or how to rig them.  Amazing!  U-tube has a number of training videos on these techniques which are infinitely better.  As a general observation I do not like most of the Bennett produced videos for the same reasons.",1490486400,,954,4.488372093023256
