2416047,1,B000BFH2HI,"This DVD would appear to be all Sherlock Holmes when in fact it is only one movie.  Yes, I know I should have known better as I have a complete collection of Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes, but I thought these were some that maybe had been overlooked and just re-released, I was wrong!  The quality is certainly not nearly as good as the collection.  It's ""dark"" and the sound quality is such as to make it hard to understand dialogue through-out the movie (Sherlock Holmes).  For me, it was a waste of money, fortunately not too many $$!  If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have bought it!!",1283990400,7,600,4.321428571428571
2416048,1,B000BFH2HI,I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN MY SHOPPING EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON UNTIL THESE PURCHASES.  THIS PRODUCT IS DELIBERATELY MISREPRESENTED BY THE MANUFACTURER TO BE SHERLOCK HOLMES FEATURING BASIL RATHBONE.  IN FACT THERE IS ONLY ONE SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIE WHICH I ALREADY OWN.  I DID NOT EVEN OPEN THE PACKAGE.  I GAVE IT TO A FRIEND WHO LIKES CLASSIC MOVIES BUT IS NOT A COLLECTOR OF BASIL RATHBONE AND NIGEL BRUCE. I WILL BE A BIT MORE CAREFUL FROM NOW ON.,1279584000,7,456,4.6625

For such a low price, I was expecting a scratchy, poor quality picture, but these were great.  I really liked the ""Dishonored Lady"" .  It was far superior to the typical Hercule Poirot series.  Agatha Christie introduces so many characters that I become confused as to which character is which.  I did not have any difficulty like that with these mysteries.

ONCE IN AWHILE ALONG COMES ANOTHER MORIARTY LIKE GEORGE ZUCCO AND OTHERS GIVE THEIR SUPPORT TO THE SHOWING OF ALL THE SHERLOCK HOLMES MYTERIES. DRESSED TO KILL IS ONE OF THE BETTER HOLMES CLASSICS.

I SAW HER WHEN I WAS A KID IN A MOVIE WITH THE GREATEST COMEDY TEAM STAN LAUREL AND OLIVER HARDY ABOUT THE FOREIGN LEGION AND FELL  MADLY IN LOVE WITH THIS STARLET. I COPIED THIS MOVIE ON MY DVD RECORDER LAST YEAR FROM TCM AND THE SOUND ON IT IS PERFECT. THE SOUND GETS A 3 BUT THE ACTING AND MOVIE GETS A 5...

THE DEATH KISS IS A VERY FINE STORY WITH A LOT OF GOOD COMICAL CHARACTERS. THAT CARRIES THE SHOW TO A 4 RATING. I FORGOT TO SAY; ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE VILLANS IS BELA LUGOSI BUT HE'S ALMOST AN UNMENTIONABLE IN THIS MOVIE. THESE 3 FILMS ARE A CREDIT TO MOVIEDOM...

TORTURE SHIP IS A DUD OR A BOMB AND DOESNOT BELONG WITH ANY OTHER SET OF MOVIES. I FEEL LIKE I GOT CHEATED, BECAUSE I THINK THE BEGINNING AND PART OF THE MIDDLE IS MISSING ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. I DON'T EVEN GIVE IT A 1 STAR; BUT I GUESS IT HAS TO GO SOMEPLACE.

Most of the films are easy to watch and allow the viewer to let their imaginations out for some exercise. These films are good for the entire family.

2416134,4,B000BFH2HI,"First Impressions:

Another ""Mystery Classics"" DVD!  Unlike some other reviews on Amazon, I will not whine and complain about the marketing of the cover or how some buyers feel ""duped"" by the cover.

Let's cover that!  The DVD has four films but if not read carefully gives the impression that all four films are Sherlock Holmes' films.  But if you look carefully, there's only one title, in red lettering, that indicates a Holmes' film, ""Dressed to Kill.""  Unlike other reviewers, I will actually touch on each film.

Film Mini-Reviews:

""Dressed to Kill"" was quite interesting.  The innuendo written in to the script is hilarious, with Basil Rathbone's dry wit and Dr. Watson's charm as played by Nigel Bruce makes a great murder mystery.  Four music boxes have been made by a criminal in a prison and he gets them out with a secret message that only the other criminals in his gang know of.

The gang leader is a woman, and she will stop at nothing to get all the boxes, even to killing the owners!  The breaking of the code and Holmes being kidnapped are the highlights of this somewhat predictable film.

""Torture Ship"" was a torture to watch!  This is the least of the bunch, with a mad doctor on a ship experimenting on criminals, as he figures that they are criminal in the first place due to ""endocrine chemicals"" and by experiment he feels he can eradicate criminality.  OK, fine, but why let the criminals run all over the ship?  And one of them strangles several sailors and is not even locked up!  There's a bit of romance with Bob and another woman but overall it's a silly story with bad editing and hard to follow what's going on.

""The Death Kiss"" has several favorite horror actors that made the film enjoyable.  Edward Van Sloan and Bela Lugosi, both of ""Dracula"" fame reunite in a murder mystery on the lot of a major Hollywood studio.  The inferences and criticisms of the studio system of the time, with arrogant producers and directors is entertaining.  The viewer is led through the plot and just when you think you got it figured out the twist ending makes you go ""Oh!""  Lugosi does not play a large role, that being of the amateur sleuth Franklyn, played by David Manners.  The comic relief by the studio guard is forced and silly, otherwise the film is not bad at all.

""Bluebeard"" with John Carradine is unintentionally funny and at times hard to follow, as a serial killer is on the streets of 19th century Paris, where no one has a French accent and people try to kill you with their sarcasm.

Features & Bottom Line:

There are no features, nary a trailer!  All black & white at various degrees of clarity, all remastered by Echo Bridge Entertainment.  ""The Death Kiss"" and ""Dressed to Kill"" make this DVD a worthy purchase, but if you could get them separately with features then go for it.",1302307200,18,2822,4.59
