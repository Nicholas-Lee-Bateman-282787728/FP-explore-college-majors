5379617,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Watched the series on The History Channel--should be part of every American History class in every high school.  A definite must see, entertaining, factual, unbiased, and highly recommended.",1353715200,5,190,5.785714285714286
5379618,5,B00A2XTJI4,"In school I dreaded history... It was boring... This series on history channel made it exciting! I have been riveted to the couch for days now... Can't get enough! Want my children to grow up to embrace our history... This series will open the door to a desire to learn more... Who would have guessed how many people were intertwined that are well known today but got their starts with other big names... Wow! You will be blown away at the effort made to put you back in time with the sets, accents etc... Just amazing!",1353369600,27,519,4.416666666666667
5379619,5,B00A2XTJI4,"This was an excellent program detailing not only the good, but the bad of the era.  We forget what America was like in the late 1800's and how far we have come.  Education like history never ends.  When we fail to remember history, we certainly will fail again.",1353110400,73,261,4.395833333333333
5379620,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I was confused. There it was, election season 2012, and the commanists had tried to persuade me that laborers were involved in construction and that government might condition, instigate, and then have to mitigate the growth of the United States, but there was Discovery Networks to edukate America on the real Men Who Built It by themselves, without none of your gubmint regalations! I even had textbooks that told me that the workers who made things were mistreated! Well, of course they were! They should have been grateful! Buried in an unmarked grave is normal for broken equipment.",1353110400,6,587,5.0
5379621,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I was browsing the channels when I happened across ""Men who built America"" on the History channel and I figured it was just a documentary and to my surprise it is more like a mini-series with action and plots. I was entirely taken in with the story line and am I am buying the DVD to see the parts that I missed. Well worth the cost of the DVD",1353024000,150,343,3.9855072463768115
5379622,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I loved this series.  Very well done.

But after reflecting, they should have added one more great achiever from that same period: George Washington Carver, in the area of agriculture and plant genetics.  I think they should still add him.  He is a striking contrast with his meekness, kindness, gentleness, and genuine Christian spirituality, etc.  Norman Borlang, who followed in his footsteps as a plant geneticist, has been credited for saving 2 billion people's lives, but the credit goes first to Carver.  A kind, reflective Christian man who lived that faith more than most, and certainly more than the five in this series.",1352764800,11,630,5.067961165048544

5379625,3,B00A2XTJI4,I was disappointed after reading all the 5 star comments. While the historical detail is fascinating there's way too much repetition. It becomes quite tedious and drawn out.,1527811200,,173,5.214285714285714
5379626,5,B00A2XTJI4,History Channel did an excellent job with this series. An easy 5 stars,1527379200,,70,4.461538461538462
5379627,5,B00A2XTJI4,"What fun to watch! My husband is a history buff, and I am also well-versed in history, particularly of the American West, but we often find ourselves saying, ""I didn't know that!"" or ""I never thought of it from that perspective."" As with most History Channel shows, most of the story is told by the narrator, but the actors are believable and do a wonderful job when they do get to act.
After fighting in the War of Independence, my gggggrandfather moved his family from Redstone Fort in Pennsylvania to Blue Licks, Kentucky in 1793. Watching this show gave me a glimpse into what life must have been like for them during those years.",1526688000,,634,4.5701754385964914

5379633,3,B00A2XTJI4,"The actual material being reenacted is well done, but the editing of this series for disk playback is absolutely miserable.  By this I mean the continuous returning to material that was played only minutes before.  Obviously the producer of this DVD/BD was working with a master prepared for television with a raft of advertisements after every ten minutes of material.  The result is just a mess to look at.",1525132800,,408,4.884057971014493

5379640,4,B00A2XTJI4,"As a history teacher, this is one of the few History Channel series that I like and will use parts of for my classroom. It does a good job of mixing history along with economics/business to give an accurate feel for such a unique time period in American history. While the action is drummed up a bit to put some pizzaz into the series, it does a good job of painting a whole picture of the times along with the major personalities of Vanderbilt and Rockefeller and how their practices, in a way, forced the hand of the federal government to become involved it a truly ""Gilded Age"" of economics.",1522972800,,594,4.409090909090909

Daniel Boone was THE Man.  Don't believe in Divine Providence?  Watch that episode alone and explain away the Thunderstorm!

Nice to watch TV that didn't put a political bias on it as well.  Thank you!",1522368000,,365,4.609375

5379662,3,B00A2XTJI4,"After touring the Morgan Library and Museum in Manhattan, I stumbled upon this 8-part drama-documentary from the History Channel in my search to learn more about J.P. Morgan.  What we discovered during our hours with this series was equal parts fascinating and frustrating.

In general, this journey through the stories of the titans of industry who established the American super-economy between the Civil War and WWI was well conceived and well executed.  The primary figures were two of the wealthiest men in American history, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, and one of the most powerful men in American history, J.P. Morgan.  Their stories were the consistent thread through the narrative that also included iconic figures like Cornelius Vanderbilt, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford.  The series is impressive in its comprehensive sweep through decades of American economics and manages to tell a compelling story of how and why these men were so important.  And the production values were high, as the entire thing looks and sounds good.

But the scope and quality of the production couldn't hide what seemed to me to be several compromising flaws.  First and foremost, the producers made what felt to me to be a rather cheesy choice to interview modern-day tycoons like Jack Welch, Mark Cuban, and Donald Trump, among many other lesser known figures.  Unfortunately, they offered very little to advance the narrative and certainly had no meaningful historical observations to make about their predecessors, instead sharing a host of generic business leadership cliches.  It all felt rather cheap and pointless.

I was also struck by how neatly everything seemed to flow together, as described by the History Channel.  A parallel reading of a book covering some of this same historical ground, decidedly more thorough and exhaustive as books can be over films, confirmed my suspicions that the story didn't actually flow as neatly and tidily as portrayed by this miniseries.  Finally, I realize that this production was made for TV, assuming viewership over the course of weeks or even months, but I almost couldn't handle how repetitive it was throughout, reusing some scenes time and time again as the same events were summarized, re-summarized, and re-resummarized incessantly.  I told my wife that if they showed Rockefeller riding his horse away from the oil pipeline one more time, I was going to run over my Edison with a Vanderbilt.

""The Men Who Built America"" is a decent guide through an important and foundational era of American history, told through the stories of some of her best and brightest entrepreneurs.  It was certainly interesting enough, my aforementioned misgivings notwithstanding.  What one thinks of these wealthy cats is an entirely separate question, and we couldn't help but be rather horrified by much of the story as it unfolded.  It's a hard thing to be simultaneously filthy rich and a decent human being, and most of these guys confirmed that tension.  Hopefully some time spent studying their lives will help us choose a different and better path forward...",1518048000,,3106,5.163672654690619
5379663,5,B00A2XTJI4,One of the most well done mini-series I have ever seen. Some of the most interesting information that I did not learn in school.,1518048000,,128,4.375

5379670,5,B00A2XTJI4,"This is the kind of show that the History Channel does so well  part dramatic recreation, part historical commentary. Stepping away from their usual military fare, this production focuses on the titans of early American industry  Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Ford, and J.P. Morgan. It follows them through various trials and tribulations as they at first establish and then enlarge their busines empires, chronicling the setbacks and misadventures that happened along the way, including those occasions on which they were brought into conflict with one another. Various talking heads, including Allan Greenspan, Steve Wynn, and Donald Trump, offer their insights on the entrepreneurial world. The show is fairly long but doesnt outstay its welcome, and offers a journey alongside the men who built America that is by turns both entertaining and informative. Picture quality is a little grainy in places, particularly for a Blu-Ray, but not too bad overall. Extras include several mini featurettes that flesh out aspects of the main narrative. Recommended.",1516060800,2,1061,5.54320987654321

As one myself, I feel that it's always a tough gig to get students excited about the Industrial Revolution of the late 19C and all the social and political issues that it spawned.

5379756,2,B00A2XTJI4,"This series would be a decent vid for a high school production, but for the History Channel this is just a poorly made drivel. Short on facts, long on constant repetition of whatever little information it has. Cheap production with re-used shots, like the pipes from Rockefeller's factory reused to depict Carnegie's steel works. Slow-mo, shallow depth of field, closeups, all to cover very limited number of set-ups and extras. The series is not re-edited from its TV variant, so it is obsessive with repeats after what would be commercial breaks. It could be easily re-edited and shortened in half.

The series seem to glorify the era of robber barons despite their cut-throat attitude towards their rivals and utter indifference and disrespect towards their workers. The people interviewed seem to be willing to become tycoons of the same caliber, visibly regretting that in present days they cannot force people to work 12 hours a day. This is a sort of propaganda that lulls people into rendering to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.

Unless, of course, this is a tongue-in-cheek production, but I don't think that modern History Channel's audience is that smart to realize how comical most of the talking heads look onscreen.

If this set were twice shorter it could be a decent fun - ""He is three times wealthier? I must crush him by getting wealthier than him!"" - but in its present form it is a gob of chewed tasteless gum.",1482883200,,1448,4.807228915662651

5379768,5,B00A2XTJI4,"The men who built America is probably the best documentary series I have seen in a long time.  I came across this on the History Channel and couldn't stop watching.  Tobin Bell does an outstanding job as the narrator.  The show also has some of the modern day business tycoons help explain their motivation and what drove the 5 men in the series to success.  For the knowledge alone I would rate this DVD series 5 stars.

I wish I could have seen this program back when I was in high school instead of all the useless stuff our history teachers ending up giving us to study at the time.  I learned more in this one program than several US history courses combined.  The series might not be 100 percent accurate in every detail but it succeeds in showing you the 5 men who helped build America from the ground up.  Each man became massively successful and their companies shaped the modern world we live in.  Like Picasso said Good artists create; great artists steal that is basically what all 5 men did in the series.  They took someone elses idea and made the best use of it for their own profit Vanderbilt in Railroads, Rockefeller in oil, Carnegie in steel, JP Morgan in electricity, Ford in the automobile.

I had heard the name Rockefeller before and knew he had something to do with the oil boom, but I had no idea he had that big of monopoly in Standard Oil.  The same can be said about Vanderbilt, the name itself makes you think of some old rich white guy but I had no idea he was the one at the head of the railroad boom across the nation.  I loved how the show explained that the rail lines were over produced which ended up in a stock market crash, basically the cause and effect scenario in hindsight.

Looking back on the show I doubt Henry Fisk would walk through the Homestead steel mill solo without a care in the world.  If he was hated by his employees that much you would think he would have had a team of bodyguards or armed guards to escort him everywhere in the building.  If he did walk solo through the mill was he armed with a gun at all times?  Just a small detail but I would be interested to know.

The show makes you think that JP Morgan was the greediest of them all, but he did basically bail out the whole U.S. financial system when it was on the brink of collapse.  How many of todays business tycoons would put their fortunes on the line to help the country my guess is not many.  I knew the least about JP Morgan only that he founded a powerful investment bank with his name on it.  The battle for electricity and its control was incredibly interesting the difference between AC current and Standard current.  After watching the PBS series on The Roosevelts you understand who Theodore was fighting to overthrow these 5 men basically and their monopolies over business controlling the whole country and its politics.

The show is fascinating and makes you want to keep watching the next episode to see what happens.  Make no mistake these were Americas greatest entrepreneurs.  All 5 men were ruthless business icons who were smart and ran their businesses efficiently.
I found the show a bit ironic the way the series paints the men as villains one minute and saints the next. The way Rockefeller and Carnegie abused their blue collar workers in their factories and making them the richest men in America.  Then at the end of the series both men gave away their fortunes and the series paints them as saints.

Overall this series is great and I learned a lot from watching it.  I would recommend it to every US history teacher or entrepreneur in the USA.  I would love to see a follow-up to this series on the modern day business tycoons.  I would rate this 5 stars and think is definitely worth buying great price.",1480550400,,3753,4.436496350364964

5379802,5,B00A2XTJI4,"This is one of my favorite T.V. shows ever. The history is great and it often shows a different side of the robber barons than we normally learn in school with the background of J.P. Morgan and his father. But what has to be remembered when watching any of this is that it is T.V. And it is not 100% accurate with many of the events being played out to make a good show.
I have watched this series over 5 times and loved it everytime!
We always think that the monopolist where some big bad group of people who were always rich and had it made from the start. The background this offers provides a different way for you to see these controversial people and business/ practices that they did/preformed. Besides for the great story/history behind these people that you could spend a lifetime learning up on, this series provides a visual aid for people who have trouble connecting the history to real people and events.
Even if you aren't a history buff' or even interested in these events you should still watch this series as it is truly an inspirational story of rags to riches for some and others a story of great success of what can come if you work hard on  achieving something of your own.",1470700800,,1194,4.427272727272728

5379829,4,B00A2XTJI4,"This is the story of the giants of the post-civil war industrial revolution:  Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Mogan and Henry Ford.  Collectively, these men served as the catalysts or the U.S. economy to shift into the 20th century.  This documentary tells the good, the bad & the ugly about all of the industrial titans.

As is always the case, 1 star is deducted from my review score due to the inclusion of Donald J. Trump and Carly Fiorinia as narration contributors. The series would've been well served to omit the commentary of those 2 fakers.  Other than that, the CEO types that he documentary invokes are basically credible.

Watching the stories of these business giants reminded me why I'm a liberal.  Did they play a huge role in transforming the industry & banking practices of the United States?  Absolutely.  Did they propel the U.S. economy into the 20th century?  Without question.  Did they help bring about dramatic changes, such as the advent of electricity and the automobile?  Without question.  All of that said, these men should not be granted a ""free pass"" for downright reprehensible behavior.  Of all the tycoons studied, only Henry Ford bequeathed to his workers a safe working environment and fair wages.  These 3 DVDs underscore why Teddy Roosevelt is my favorite President: he was the 1st one to stand up to their abuse of capitalism.  To be clear:  I have no problem with the tycoons making a lot of $$. What I do take issue with is how they hoarded their profits.

It was not until the tail end of their lives that Rockefeller and Carnegie used their enormous wealth for the interests of philanthropy.  A great many workers for each never benefited from their late change-of-heart.  My all-time favorite photograph is of the 1927 Solvay conference.  It has, I would argue, the most intellectual firepower ever captured in a single photograph.  The nice thing about being a fan of the scientists pictured is that they made their progress in science without having to shaft anyone.  They were driven by a curiosity about how the universe works rather than a desire for ever greater profits.  I can be a fan of the attendees of the 1927 Solvay conference minus any distaste in my mouth.

The same cannot be said for  the life stories that the present DVD set delves into.  Were the tycoons great men?  Depending on how you define your terms, the answer may be ""yes.""  Were they worthy of our admiration?  For the most part, I would say ""no.""  Does recalling their life & times carry with it a lot of unsavory baggage?  Absolutely.  That's just the way it goes.",1464307200,,2624,4.76

Throughout, there are a ton of review sections repeating video and narration that was just viewed.  These sections are very noticeable and take away from the overall experience.

I did catch one 'blooper' in the second episode.  When Rockefeller first struck his deal with Vanderbilt, the narrator says that he had 'promised to provide 60 train cars of oil each day to be transported on Vanderbilt's trains...though his capacity to produce at the time was only half that.'  Nine minutes later, the narrative says 'but Rockefeller has over-promised...guaranteeing Vanderbilt he would provide 60 BARRELS of oil a day...more than twice his capacity.'

5379941,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I loved viewing this tape.  It was both informative and entertaining.  It tells the story of how Mr. Vanderbilt knitted together a railway system for the North east, then Rockefeller manufactured the quality safe kind of kerosene oil used in lamps which ordinary citizens used to light the nation from coast to coast;  then adds Mr. Carnegie who's steel girders improved bridges, railroads, and then built skyscrapers in all the big cities across America, to Mr. Morgan who bought out Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, Tesla's patents on electricity, and used Edison's electric light bulbs and power generating equipment to literally light up america from coast to coast replacing the kerosene lamps.
  Morgan bought out Carnegie steel to merge other smaller steel companies into U.S. Steel and he created General Electric and finally personally intervened to safe the U.S. Banking system twice: 1893 and 1907.
  Finally, Mr. Ford comes along to re create the business model upon which most factories are based to this day.  Ford also modified the negative business practices used by Rockefeller and Carnegie when he paid Ford workers a living wage and provided relatively safe working conditions for them and defeated in court the monopoly which tried to stop him from making his model T car.
  The nation owes these five men who built modern America ( 1865 to 1911) much.  Some liberal historians term them ""Robber barons.""  But that is a false smear on their reputations.  Their actions collectively improved the daily living standards of a majority of American citizens and led to the creation of the ""middle class.""  There are cameo appearances by Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina.

If you think everything was better in the good ol' days of America, this would be a reality check! Biographies include Andrew Carnegie (U.S. Steel), J.P. Morgan (Morgan Chase), Vanderbilt (Railroads), John D. Rockefeller (Standard Oil, now Exxon-Mobil, Chevron, etc) and Henry Ford. Carnegie's treatment of the steeworkers was absolutely riveting! (please excuse my lame attempt at humor here). Some details may have been watered down, such as the shootings at or by the striking steelworkers, and all the reasons behind Ford's entering his new car into a successful race with the top racer in the nation. The grandiosity of these men in history, and their egotistical competitiveness with each other despite having more money than Bill Gates and Warren Buffet combined in today's dollars, shows the extent to which human nature can covet.

5380014,4,B00A2XTJI4,"I originally saw this series on the History Channel and liked it so much I bought a copy. Having watched it again now, I think it's an exceptionally well executed way to tell the story of how a handful of Americans made their fortunes in the mid to late 19th century.

Vanderbilt (trains), Rockefeller (oil), Carnegie (steel), Morgan (finance) and Ford (cars) were able to spot possibilities earlier than anyone else and that visionary quality they shared allowed them to amass fortunes even larger than names we know today, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. Their lives, intense rivalries, and business acumen are portrayed in this documentary through an effective combination of dramatization and skilled narration.

There is a third element woven throughout -- interviews with contemporary business successes like Donald Trump (real estate), Steve Case (aol), a hedge fund manager, a Hollywood producer, and others -- all talking about their own experiences and what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur today. During my first viewing of this documentary I found these interviews superfluous. But with my second viewing, I recognized that they do add a valuable dimension to the story. They show that the ruthlessness and vicious business tactics used by Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, et. al. are still a critical element in what makes for success today.

There is clearly a ""type"" of person that makes it ""big."" And in this documentary you will learn what kind of person that is. And it's not a particularly flattering portrait.

My main criticism of the documentary is that it was clearly created with spaces for commercial breaks. And after each (and there are a lot of them), there is a way too lengthy narrated summary of what transpired previously. That works fine on TV. But when the History Channel converted this series to DVD, those repetitive summaries should have been edited out.",1438732800,7,1899,5.096463022508039

This might be useful if you were watching it on the air over several nights but when you watch it at home on a dvd it is frustratingly repetitive. Making matters worse is the navigation menu, which is almost useless. Choosing segments within a disk is baflfing and does not seem possible.

5380068,3,B00A2XTJI4,"There are numerous over-simplifications and inaccuracies. The assassination attempt on Frick, for example. Frick didn't beat up his assassin. Others intervened. The race between Ford and Winton? While it's true that their's were the only cars still running by the end, they were not the only ones that showed up to race that day. (The movie makes it sound like a grudge match between the two men.)  Next, at the end of the series, there is drawn out editorializing that says, basically, Although these men were greedy and ruthless and many people suffered, but it couldn't have been done any other way. That is non-sense. Besides being unprovable, the prosperity that America enjoy after their monopolies were broken up is strong evidence that competition, fair wages and better working conditions lead to a prosperous nation. Also, the people that made these industries possible were men like Nicola Tesla, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and other inventors, including of course, Henry Ford. But I still enjoyed the series. Just remember, there's more to the story.",1427587200,2,1072,5.160919540229885

5380070,2,B00A2XTJI4,"A classic case of ""history is written by the winners."" The number of inaccuracies, slights, and misconceptions in this series is close to intolerable if you've read much American history. The sidebars by some of today's greediest and most corrupt billionaires puts the political stamp on the documentary's perspective, though. Watching a no-nothing trustfund brat like Donny Trump babble about Edison's creativity or Carnegie's tolerance for risk lets you know this is history told for and by the people who imagine that the hard work is done at the top of the food chain.

Anyone foolish enough to believe that Tesla was Edison's ""apprentice"" will be silly enough to imagine this documentary is the whole story. Edison was so jealous of Tesla's real engineering skill that he spend millions stealing his work and burying his memory. The massive quantity of luck involved in the success of any of these men is ignored. The work and talents of the hundreds of men who were thrust aside to keep the limelight on and money flowing to the robber barons isn't even considered. Over all, this series is a ""let's all give three cheers for the 1%"" puff piece. Even their part in murder, sabotage, theft, betrayal, corruption, and political manipulation is glossed over as it those events were insignificant and not the real keys to their fortunes.

Jack Welch, Mark Cuban, Charles Schwab, Trump, and a few other modern day criminals who have drug the nation to its current low state for personal gain and power feel like the director's stamp on this story. There are way too few historians interviewed and way too many self-promoters. It could have been a great series, but the History Channel chose to play it safe and whitewash the story to keep the conservatives happy. It's possible that the series took on too much scope to be able to maintain accuracy or a balanced perspective.

The production values are fine, although the musical choices are weird. The actors were well chosen for their parts and the camera and sound work are professionally done.",1427068800,,2048,4.8962536023054755

5380077,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Excellent. Really pulls together the steps in the development of this country's industrial power. It links oil to the railroad, the railroad to steel, and steel to electricity. Thank you.",1426723200,,187,5.266666666666667

5380080,5,B00A2XTJI4,Excellent historical documentary providing an in-depth overview of how America became the global leader in business activities and the leader of capitalism and the growing pains and issues dealt with and solved in doing so. It was very interesting learning about the interactions and personal competition among those who contributed to America's growth and rise to power.,1426291200,,371,5.526315789473684

5380085,5,B00A2XTJI4,Great Movie. I felt inspired and think that capitalism isn't such a bad thing. It was very interesting how people built wealth long ago and how people were self made and their money was not handed down from old money.,1425513600,,217,4.45
5380086,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Fasinating information.  As there are no cimmercials, but the commercial break leads were not taken out, there is some repetition when it ""returns"" to the series each time, but makes for good review of what you just watched if you are having your kids watch, anyway,  We've watched the entire thing twice now,  Excellent for your home library.",1425513600,,343,4.879310344827586

5380089,4,B00A2XTJI4,My wife and I were watching this on the Public Broadcast Station and my wife was very interested. Because I am several years older than her so I was already familiar with how most of those men came into power. But I bought this dvd as a gift for my wife. She gave it a four star rating and said it is very interesting. It is also a good teaching tool and a motivational dvd. These men were able to think outside the box to come up with new ideas to corner the market. It also puts forth the ruthlessness of that day and time in the business world of America.,1425340800,,558,4.036036036036036

This series explains in a historical context. Le si fare  economics all the pros and cons of capitalism.  It realy should be tool of education in highschool ecomonics.  Everyone should at least have a clear understanding of the foundation of their political and finacial veiws regardless of what they might be.,1423440000,,478,4.8765432098765435

5380110,5,B00A2XTJI4,I liked this series when it was on TV so purchase it to watch now and then. I am not a historian so don't know if it is absolutely perfectly historically accurate in all ways but I do know it is well acted and probably a good general overview of the men who built America.,1423094400,,272,3.963636363636364
5380111,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Absolutely outstanding series.  I happened to see some of this on the history channel one night at a hotel while traveling for work.  I had the T.V. on in the background while doing my computer work.  I was completely taken in, and set my work aside.  I had to buy it to see all of it afterwards.  It was great seeing these entrepreneurs and their spirit and drive towards success.  It was interesting to be reminded how free America used to be.  This was back before the media and government really demonized hard working and successful people the way they do today.  They did a good job of mixing a little acting and narrating to tell the story.",1423008000,,647,4.423728813559322
5380112,5,B00A2XTJI4,This is an awesome documentary.  I highly recommend it.,1423008000,,55,5.111111111111111
5380113,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Loved it. Even though the recaps after every commercial break got exceedingly tedious. The show was so good I had to force myself to watch every episode.
But I had to force myself the last few. Took me an extra week and a half because I knew how badly it would drag between new additions.
Had to give it a full five stars in spite of that. It touched on a magnificent half century and explored both sides of every issue. If somebody had edited perhaps a third I would say it deserved ten stars.",1422835200,,494,4.2105263157894735

I knew very little about these men prior to watching, but this was presented in such a fun, creative, unique way that I could not get enough. I was able to retain a lot of knowledge as well because of how entertaining it was to watch.",1422403200,,356,4.492307692307692

5380118,1,B00A2XTJI4,"These programs are endlessly repetitive, slowly paced, and offer voluminous detail beyond what many people will appreciate. Most annoying is the self-important commentary by pontificating big shots in business, advertising, real estate, history, etc, that constantly interrupt the narrative and make the irritatingly slow pace even slower. And the choice of people like Donald Trump, Donny Deutsch, Steve Case, and other has beens and never weres in this role is especially annoying. Steve Case founded AOL, and maybe that wowed them back when this documentary was made. But today, it just seems silly to style this guy as a great business leader. To see a clown like Donald Trump in this role speaks for itself. Finally, the fawning praise for the robber barons who exploited labor with slave wages and horrendous working conditions offers a lack of editorial balance and thoughtful analysis. These are men who deserved prison. Not praise!",1422230400,2,940,5.273333333333333
5380119,5,B00A2XTJI4,"This should be mandatory to watch for all those who are in to American history. I saw this originally on The History Channel and I had to have this in my library. It's not by Ken Burns, but it sure comes close.",1422230400,,210,4.023809523809524

5380128,3,B00A2XTJI4,"I'm currently in the middle of THE MEN WHO BUILT AMERICA and am enjoying it but with a few small quibbles.

This four episode, six hour (sans commercials) miniseries starts off on a bit of a clunk when it claims that Abraham Lincoln was the very last Civil War casualty. Also I would like to see an occasional photo of the actual men these re-enactors portray.

Finally, and most vexing of all, after every return from an ad break there's the same reiteration of what's already gone before. Seeing more than a dozen times per chapter ""railroads, oil, steel, electricity"" with the same footage of men laying rail, oil spewing from a wooden derrick, molten steel and a crude lightbulb's dim glow while the narrator repeats the same phrases gets more than a bit maddening.

This would've made a great topic for master documentarian Ken Burns to do up right.",1421971200,2,854,4.68

This series recounts how Cornelius Vanderbilt, JP Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and Henry Ford build their empires.

5380253,1,B00A2XTJI4,"I've read multiple scholarly biographies of all of these men and many books regarding business history regarding this time period. The writers of this series did an abysmal job sticking to factual accounts of the lives of these men and the events of the time period. This is more than just a few small inaccuracies. Nearly the entire characterization of each of the men in the series and the events of this time period are flat-out incorrect. I cannot even begin to try and correct some of these inaccuracies in a forum like this, as there's so much to write that it would be impracticable to do it on a comments board. And I wouldn't even chalk up this hack-job as an attempt by the writers to make a misleading political statement. It's so bad, that this can only be a product of pure amateurism exerted across all aspects of the series production - from the production studio executives, the network, the writers and anyone involved with the production. The only people i would pardon for their participation are the historians they interview for commentary throughout the series. Many of them are biographers who I've personally read and they're very well researched scholars of these men and the era. They clearly had no had access to the actual script or any control over the creative process.

If you're interested in this period - my first recommendation would be John D Rockefeller's biography Titan by Ron Chernow.",1416009600,7,1424,4.788617886178862

5380314,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I watched an absolutely fascinating series on the History Channel (now available on DVD) entitled ""The Men Who Built America"".  It traces the careers of some of the most powerful men in American history including Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, J. P. Morgan and Henry Ford.  It is one of the first series I have ever seen that does not white wash the rise to power of these so-called 20th century ""titans"" of industry.

Probably the thing I found most disturbing in the series was the apparent viewpoint of these men that they were somehow above the subhuman worker populations they employed. They were willing to acquire wealth through any means possible and their net worth, regardless of how it was acquired, represented to them their superior worth as a human being.

Each of these men had personal ambition that knew no bounds and a ruthlessness that drove them to exploit every opportunity in an industrial landscape that had little regulation to prevent insider trading, overt market manipulation and outright intimidation or protect the rights of workers.

Andrew Carnegie was treated a little more gently than the others mainly because he handed off the day to day operations of Carnegie Steel to a totally ruthless chairman named Henry Frick so Carnegie could ostensibly sail off to Scotland to enjoy the fruits of his labors.

Today, we associate Andrew Carnegie with education and the arts because of his philanthropic contributions to Carnegie Hall, Carnegie-Mellon University and thousands of libraries around the world.  But, in truth, Carnegie was the ultimate decision maker in the operation of his steel empire during a tumultuous period of violence and and even death. He was certainly aware of the decisions implemented by his chairman and did nothing to intervene in plant operations until nine workers at his flagship Homestead Steel Works were gunned down by the Pinkertons under Frick's orders in 1892.

The steel workers had been ground down by increasingly longer hours - 12 hours a day six days a week by the time of the massacre - under absolutely hellish conditions, while wages were whittled away by Frick to increase profits.

When I researched the life of Andrew Carnegie further to write this review I read that Carnegie claimed he was a disciple of Herbert Spencer whose economic theory of evolution is best characterized as economic survival of the fittest.  Spencer declared that any provisions made to assist the weak, unskilled, poor and distressed to be an imprudent disservice to evolution and that ""severe fate"" was the natural process to single out the weak, debauched and disabled.

I noticed, however, that even Spencer was appalled when he visited one of Carnegie's steel works and remarked, ""Six months' residence here would justify suicide.""

The program pointed out that 1 in 11 steel workers at the time were suffering horrendous injuries or death.  Yet labor unions had only been formed to bargain for wages and working conditions for just the skilled workers, less than 1/4 of the workforce.  Even so, Frick complained about the labor union that represented the skilled workers at the Homestead Steel Works in a letter to Carnegie stating ""The mills have never been able to turn out the product they should, owing to being held back by the Amagamated men.""  Although Carnegie had publicly claimed to be in favor of labor unions, privately he agreed with Frick and gave his approval to Frick's efforts to break the union at Homestead.

Carnegie's carefully cultivated public personae as a responsible industrialist and generous philanthropist was often used as a smoke screen to obscure his less noble activities.  For example, Carnegie publicly advocated less government while aggressively lobbying for protective trade tariffs that resulted in millions of dollars a year in extra revenue for his companies.

In this documentary, the producers pointed out that the development of Carnegie's benevolent personae was a direct result of the public relations nightmare generated by the Johnstown flood that killed 2,209 people in 1889.

Carnegie's chairman, Henry Frick, and a group of speculators, developed  an exclusive club for leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania, most connected through business dealings to Carnegie Steel.  The club was located  along the shore of Lake Conemaugh behind the South Fork Dam above the town of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

The area had been prone to flooding since its founding by Joseph Johns at the confluence of the Stoney Creek and Little Conemaugh rivers in 1800.  The steep hills of the narrow Conemaugh Valley and the Allegheny Mountains range to the east produced large amounts of runoff from annual rain and snowfall.  This vulnerability was further compounded as the community grew and became the site of Cambria Iron Works who dumped slag from its iron furnaces along the river to create more land for building, but further narrowed the riverbed.

To make matters worse, Frick and his development speculators then lowered the dam,  so the top of the dam could be used as a roadway for Frick and his fellow wealthy clubmembers' carriages. They also built a fish screen in the spillway, the only remaining water control mechanism. A previous owner had already removed and sold for scrap the three cast iron discharge pipes that had been originally used to control the release of water.

Then the worst downpour ever recorded in the area, 6 - 10 inches of rain in just 24 hours, struck.  Following a night of unrelenting rain, at 3:10 p.m. on May 31, 1889, the South Fork Dam collapsed sending a 60 foot wall of water and debris down upon the residents of Johnstown.  The death toll was the largest loss of civilian life in American history until the collapse of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.  Wikipedia states the 1900 Galveston hurricane claimed more lives but the program producers must not have agreed.

 As is usually the case when the uber rich are involved, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was never held legally responsible for the disaster.  The court ruled the disaster an ""act of God"" and denied the survivors any legal compensation.  But the club members, including Carnegie, were vilified in the national press.  (The court ruling was considered so irresponsible a number of states adopted Rylands v. Fletcher, a British common-law precedent establishing the liability of a landowner with a reservoir for flood damage if the reservoir is not properly maintained.)

Anyway, since then, Carnegie had worked very hard to restore his reputation.

So back to the Homestead Strike of 1892 - just before the confrontation, the union had requested a wage increase in their collective bargaining agreement that was due to expire on June 30, 1892.  Frick countered with a 22% wage decrease and proposed the elimination of a number of positions and that the steel works would become non-union after the expiration of the current contract.  Pointing out that the union only represented the skilled workers at the plant, Carnegie exclaimed the union was ""an elitist discriminatory organization that was not worthy of the Republic!""

Frick eventually relented a little and offered a slightly better wage agreement. But the union refused the offer so Frick shuttered the mill the night before the contract expired and built a barricade around the mill to keep workers from returning.  The workers took possession of the mill anyway, determined to prevent operation by strikebreakers imported by Frick.  So Frick called in the Pinkertons to route the workers from the mill using any means necessary.

I had no idea that the Pinkertons at this point in history actually had more firepower than the entire United States military.  When the program explained this and I reacted with incredulity my husband pointed out ""How do you think we got companies like Blackwater?!!""
When I further researched this statement, I found it to be absolutely true.  Apparently the Pinkertons by the 1890s had more agents than there were soldiers in the U.S. Army and were often hired by late 19th and early 20th century businessmen to infiltrate unions, block strikers, keep unionists out of factories and even recruit ""goon"" squads to intimidate workers.  It sounds more like the mob than a reputable security agency!

Anyway, 300 Pinkerton agents armed with Winchester rifles fired on the striking workers at Carnegie's Homestead Steel Works, killing  nine of the men and wounding 23 others.  Seven Pinkerton agents were also killed.

As the program recounted these turbulent events I was totally riveted.  The production was punctuated by short reenactments by professional actors playing the different industrialists in crucial scenes of their careers.  These cut scenes were just enough to draw you into their world and make the program seem more of a drama rather than a documentary.

I would highly recommend this series as a way to understand not only the history of the individuals portrayed but the evolution of industry in the United States and how it impacts our lives today.  I would especially encourage any American history teachers out there to incorporate this series into their curiculum to provide their students with an unvarnished look at the foundations of American capitalism.",1409529600,,9323,5.1020408163265305

5380345,1,B00A2XTJI4,"This is a biased, anti-business telling of US history.  It's a pretty obvious form or progressive liberal propaganda.  I would not let my kids watch such a distorted telling of our history.  I've read scholarly biographies on almost all the central characters and they are telling the story they want to tell with a very selective use of the facts.  The misrepresentation is greatest with JP Morgan and his restructuring of failing industries to prevent complete monopoly and instead establish sustainable duopolies.  They try to make all the men sound like robber barons in constant conflict with each other.  They don't explain how the economics of their industries created many of the circumstances.  This is a comic book version of US history clearly produced with a political agenda by someone that doesn't want Americans to understand their actual history as it relates to business and finance.",1406592000,14,900,5.123287671232877

The references to the western Pennsylvania history regarding the Pittsburgh steel industry, the Homestead works, and how it ties into the cataclysmic Johnstown flood are a must watch for anyone with roots in this area.  Granted, I know there has been some exercising of a dramatic license, but it is extremely well done and not over the top like some shows in this genre.

I have loaned the set to my father in law who at 94 has lived through much of the history presented.  I am looking forward to watching it again with him and in addition my 20 year old son.

While not 100% historically accurate, the series is by no means historical fiction, either. How picky do you want to be? (I know - Historians are always nit-picky about everything historical, but seriously!)

Bottom line: the series presents some solid history wrapped in a docu-drama format that isn't corny like a lot of the History channel stuff can be.

This was originally shown on the History Channel and everytime there was a break for commercial, when the show returned, there was a little recap.

5380428,5,B00A2XTJI4,My husband and I love to watch this together.  Its great for historical information but its done in a way that is not boring.  With the reenactments and such it really feels almost like watching a theater movie versus a documentary.,1393459200,,232,4.634146341463414
5380429,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Both my husband and I loved the series on TV. Unfortunately the last two hour episode (JP Morgan and Henry Ford) was either not shown or we missed it.  Thankfully, that once again Amazon did not let us down and we were able to obtain a copy of the series. A wonderful informative series on these great and sometimes ruthless men who helped build our great country.",1393286400,,364,4.432835820895522
5380430,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Very well done.  Dramatically engrossing.  A broad sweep of economic development and revolution covered interestingly and yet in a reasonable time.  I'd recommend it to economics teachers in high school and college, as well as to history teachers teachiing that period.",1393286400,,269,5.512195121951219
5380431,5,B00A2XTJI4,How hard to make such a long story in a short time. I learned a lot. An Oscar is deserved for the movie or series actors and directors camera men etc.,1393286400,,150,3.870967741935484
5380432,1,B00A2XTJI4,"I had great hopes for this series based on reviews, but the historical accuracy is a joke.  I could go into just the major ones, but the review would run on for pages.  The Death of Tom Scott had no impact on Carnegie feelings toward Rockefeller, Frick had is challenges, but almost nothing in this show portrays him or the events around him accurately.  JP Morgan didn't run companies; he invested his and others money into firms.  Carnegie Steel was not saved by Morgan.  The ST Louis Bridge was not a great vision of Carnegie and had almost no impact on the development of the steel industry, etc.  The show has a clear progressive/liberal tilt that has unfortunately continues to portray these individuals as ruthless Robber Barons will little care or concern for the rest of humanity.  The show provides little on how they greatly increased the standard of living of Americans and created greater wealth for millions of people.
 This  is a well filmed and performed period piece that is entertaining to watch.  Just don't purchase it to provide your kids a history lesson because it is mostly fiction.",1393200000,28,1106,4.773684210526316
5380433,5,B00A2XTJI4,The characteristic that made these capitalistic giants great and sometimes ruthless was their ability to think both short-term and long-term simultaneously. Certainly these same type of  individuals exist on a global basis today; but these men produced so much (both good and bad) in such a short period of time that the viewer is continuously focused on the mark that these giants made on the world.,1393113600,,400,5.0606060606060606
5380434,5,B00A2XTJI4,It is a truly excellent description of the time and particularly the men who created the time.  It is really amazing that so few men welded so much power and control of the lives of others.,1393027200,,189,4.25

5380437,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I love this because it was a mix of narration and actors acting out how history played out. I'm not a history buff, so I can't speak to the accuracy/validity of every detail mentioned, but I thought it was fascinating.",1392681600,,218,4.475
5380438,5,B00A2XTJI4,"For those who appreciate the TRUTH, this series shows what is the reality of the human equation...to succeed, one must use the brain, in a logical, ordered manner, and, NEVER quit, regardless of the assured obstacles that will be encountered.  ""If wishes were horses, beggars would ride."" has, always, been correct. When one gives up the drive to achieve, to succeed, that person is ripe for the agenda that wants to make surfs out of the far too many that want something for nothing...handouts are not free, you pay with your freedom.  One can only hope your series reawakens the drive, the dedication, required for this nation, not to look to D.C. for our sustenance, but, to use our own strength of purpose to earn security and success.  That's real freedom.  History repeatedly tells the truth about what happens to the surfs of all the 'national socialistic agendas',...""We'll take care of you."".  You bet they will!!!  Read, listen, learn...your series is a great example of the truth...hard work is the only answer...lies feed the ignorant.",1392508800,2,1047,4.954285714285715

5380457,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Our small high school of 13 students enjoyed this series immensely.  It perfectly complemented our history of the later 1800's to early 1900's.  The balance of drama and fact caught their interest perfectly.  The one downside is the constant review clips, but this did not ruin the students' interest.  Now their parents are enjoying the series as well.",1390780800,,353,5.0344827586206895

5380461,4,B00A2XTJI4,"The history was very interesting, but the continuous overlap and repetition of episodes is very frustrating for the viewer. I realize this was a made for TV series, but Is it not possible to edit out the recall segments from each previous episode to provide more flow and continuity to the story?

A great video that tells the story of the Captain's of Industry  who helped make America an economic JUGGERNAUT.

This is worth watching again and again!",1389484800,,284,5.195652173913044
5380469,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Though the series takes a simplified approach to a complex period in American history, it is very informative. This period is often ignored in school text books in favor of politics, though it is the industrialization of America which set in motion the superpower status (for better and for worse) that we own today. It also deals with the roots of a capitalistic economy- its benefits and its pitfalls. The series teaches that capitalism must be balanced with worker's rights and that our society cannot succeed with unregulated wealth accumulation in the hands of a very few, but also teaches that capitalism produces ingenuity like no other system in the world.",1389484800,,664,4.990990990990991

5380476,4,B00A2XTJI4,"These robber barons were the original 1% of American society. JP Morgan, Vanderbilt and Rockefeller can be credited with creating the modern business age. They also did some terrible things to achieve success, which are now illegal. This is a facinating look the men, their lives, & their relationship to each other against the backdrop of history. I highly recommend it to anybody interested in the history of U.S. business. I found myself comparing these men to today's high flyers; the founders of Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon. None of today's moguls have the same amount of power and influence as say JP Morgan because our society is so much bigger, diverse and regulated. But it's still interesting to compare/contrast that era with our own.",1389139200,,749,5.048387096774194

5380486,4,B00A2XTJI4,"I think History did a great job in choosing a topic like business/industry/labor in the 19th-20th centuries, something that needs more attention brought to it. They also make it very interesting and the intro sequence and music that introduces ""The Men Who Built America"" gets you excited about the series.
However, my major problem deals with how much repetition there is while watching via DVD. I understand TV shows need to have some recap at the beginning of episodes and after a commercial break to remind viewers or keep new viewers from changing the channel, but sometimes the recap/repetition dragged on and I had seen the same scene several times.  I remember the beginning of one episode I almost turned off because I thought I had already seen it but I hadn't, they just spent over 7 minutes talking about the same thing/showing the same scenes that the last episode covered.

All in all, they did a decent job and I would recommend it with that one caveat.",1388880000,,968,4.755952380952381

5380502,3,B00A2XTJI4,"Enjoyed the series, but everyone had to struggle through all the repetitive film clips and narration.  It has to be just about the worst job of editing ever done (that is if any editing was done.....).  The History Channel should never have allowed this otherwise interesting series to be released in this fashion.  Having said that, if you can tolerate watching the same material over and over again (about 25% of the total DVD time will be regurgitated multiple times) you will enjoy the content of the show.",1387670400,,510,4.7727272727272725
5380503,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I'm a teacher and use this series in my class to teach about the economics of our country and to review concepts taught in American history. I love the history, but my students love the drama! My students (13-14yrs) sing the theme song in the hallway and love learning about their country's historic icons via an exciting and intense series. These episodes are not only educational, but bring to life an engaging time period that for many students seems boring and uninteresting. I highly recommend them! I will be showing them for years to come!",1387670400,,546,4.757894736842105
5380504,5,B00A2XTJI4,Its a gift. I don't know how it is. I can't say much more about it. I heard it was good,1387670400,,87,3.1904761904761907

5380506,4,B00A2XTJI4,Beautiful cover. I haven't watched it because it's a gift for Christmas. I love the history channel so I really have no doubt it's bad. I bought it for a friend of mine who is a history buff and is always reading about it. Think she will thoroughly enjoy it.,1387238400,,258,4.18
5380507,4,B00A2XTJI4,Don't think they would be able to build America in today's World. Too much Government.............Good thing they got it done when they did. This should be required viewing in our schools.,1387238400,,188,5.096774193548387

5380509,4,B00A2XTJI4,"This is a pretty decent, and reasonably accurate story of five of the giants of American history after the Civil War and into the early 20th century.  Most history is told from the perspective of presidents, generals, and various wars or couquests.  That is very useful, but it doesn't tell why America grew from a nearly broken country at the end of the Civil War to the most powerful country in the world.  It's also provides a pretty good history of economics; although there is no mention of supply and demand curves, or the theories of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, or John Maynard Keynes.  America wasn't built by the lone cowboy.  America is strong because it's economy is strong.  Freedoms preserved by our Founders in the Constitution, a country rich in raw but unused materials, and giants such as Vanderbilt, Morgan, Carnegie, Rockefeller, and Ford, who in their personal quests to build wealth helped create the wealthiest economy the world has ever seen.  I especially liked their depictions as young men, although several were poorly cast.  Most photos of them were as old men.  As callow youths all of them had enormous drives and nearly unique gifts for redefining how to get things done more productively.  This documentary, supplemented by appropriate scholarship, could make an excellent undergraduate history course.",1386979200,,1344,5.040723981900452
5380510,4,B00A2XTJI4,"Great insight and told in a manner easily understood and the interactions between these men.  I had just returned from a trip to Scotland Carnegie is heralded, and rightly so, as a hometown hero. It was interesting to understand how that influence and connection to the America shaped our history.",1386892800,,297,4.94

5380512,5,B00A2XTJI4,"A very well produced mini series.  A deep look inside the business and personnal lives of the men behind the might of the industrial age of America.  Their triumphs and defeats.  This is not just a series on the men but on the industries of oil, steel, electricity, the automobile and the railways as well.

5380517,5,B00A2XTJI4,"If all of history was taught like this I would have enjoyed it. Wonderful portrayal on the entrepreneurs that influenced the way we live today. Not completely unbiased but close and well narrated to keep the viewer absorbed in the stories of Ford, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan and Vanderbilt",1386288000,,292,5.104166666666667
5380518,5,B00A2XTJI4,"This is the Story of America! Very well done documentary, and very eye-opening! The best part about this in depth story is that it is all TRUE! And for the price, you can't beat it, especially if you buy it used.",1386201600,,212,4.195121951219512

5380521,5,B00A2XTJI4,"A great offering on five of the many titans who pioneered several industries that contributed to the rise of the United States as a capitalist juggernaut, and provided a name and face to industrial and financial moguls who determined the course of much of the history of this country even as it exist today.  Ford....Rockefeller....Carnegie....Morgan....Vanderbilt....one story is as interesting and as captivating as the next. For those who may have seen The Men Who Built America on the History channel, the DVD includes several hours of ""never before seen on television"" bonus features. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone interested in American history, and the men who dreamed of greatness, and who were seduced by the money and power that often accompanies it. A genuine 5 star production!",1386115200,,798,5.186046511627907

5380525,3,B00A2XTJI4,"For history buffs, these stories of our nations first mega-rich business tycoons is a ""must see"". You'll finish watching these and have a much greater appreciation for the federal regulations that counter-balance deficiencies of a capitalistic economy. The relatively low rating of 3 stars is due to the large amount of repetitious segments. I estimate that 20-25% of what you watch is shown twice or more due to the DVD's not being re-edited for a non-televised viewing audience.",1385596800,,480,5.166666666666667

5380528,5,B00A2XTJI4,"The movie spoke to me. Although I've already read their biographies, seeing the movie also helps.
Every entrepreneur should endeavor to have a copy.",1385337600,,148,5.208333333333333

5380532,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I have been teaching history for over 28 years. In that time I have always sought videos that will help to SHOW just what history is all about. This series tops the list of History Channel programs I have used. After viewing the first episode on Vanderbilt, with a study guide that I created, many of my students were asking, ""OK, what happens next?"" The interaction between these powerful men was fascinating. The best part of that is, it was not only fascinating to me, but to my students as well. Also, the fact that there are clips with real contemporary business people, like Mark Cuban, makes it even more relevant to students. I would highly recommend this series to anyone, but especially those who teach American History.",1385078400,,730,4.7109375

5380534,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Fabulous movie!  As Calvin Coolidge said in 1925, ""the business of America IS business"".
The most profound part of this movie was when Rockefeller, Carnegie & JP Morgan got together and decided they needed to ""buy a President"".
Nothing has changed.
In 2008, the American people voted for Obama.  They voted for ""change"".  The DOW was @ 6,000.
As I write this review, the DOW is 16,000.  1,000 points higher.
In five years, THAT is what has changed.
The business of America IS .. business.",1384732800,,488,4.705882352941177

5380536,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Everyone should experience this documentary.  It is engaging and informative.  The only thing I did not like was about the documentary itself, it seemed to repeat a few things and stopped too abruptly.  It left you wondering.

5380543,5,B00A2XTJI4,This was excellent my son and I watched it when the series was playing on PBS TV. I bought it because I feel the history within this series should be in every home. I also feel this should be should by 2nd or 3rd grade to stimulate interest in history. Children have no interest in history unless it is presented well and this DVD series did and EXCELLENT job,1383091200,,359,4.217391304347826

5380545,5,B00A2XTJI4,This is an era I knew little about.  I really learned a good deal and enjoyed the series.  There was repetition which was good for review but a little annoying at times.,1382918400,,169,4.25
5380546,4,B00A2XTJI4,It is a great story line but it being edited for television makes it review everything for commercial breaks and it gets to me after a while but otherwise a great showing of historical titans,1382832000,,191,4.485714285714286
5380547,5,B00A2XTJI4,Another aspect of U.S. history that we never really learn.  Great for classroom activities if you are a teacher because of the format and style of the film.  Not that old boring kind of documentary of history.,1382832000,,209,4.621621621621622

I previously watched it on PBS and enjoyed it so much I wanted to watch it again and have a copy of it in my DVD library.  This is a documentary that you won't want to watch just once....you will want to watch it several times.

5380569,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Caught bits and pieces what this aired on the History Channel.  I ordered this and put it in the very first day.

Pros:
+ It's presented in a way that's educational AND entertaining
+ It felt more like watching movies of the actual people, not actors 100 years later
+ It captured the attention of my entire family

Cons:
- After watching it, I was left scratching my head wondering ""what can I do to be more like those guys""
- They only had so much time to feature a few guys, I vote they go for round 2 and feature another group

Really, this is an awesome collection / series / documentary (whatever you want to refer to it as).

I highly recommend it, and it is well worth the money and I'm sure we'll run through it again before the year's out.",1378944000,,749,4.173611111111111

5380578,5,B00A2XTJI4,"This is a well done series.  Another reviewer has pointed out oversimplifications that may distort the story, and it wouldn't surprise me.  However it's interesting how it dances around revealing some truths, like the extent to which European bankers and secret societies were involved.  For instance, during a strike in a steel mill, Frick writes to Carnegie for permission to deal with the strike.  Carnegie is ""vacationing"" in Scotland, which was running the British Empire.  He gives Frick permission to go at the strikers in his predictably brutal fashion, with circumlocutions and evasions.  But interestingly, in his last letter, he uses the ""royal 'we'"":  ""We have every confidence you will...""  He indicates that it is the will of the British Empire, but the narrators say nothing of pressure from Britain, or any secret society.  The theme is never mentioned, although it pops up again and again as an undercurrent.  Morgan tells his son he is handling a bond sale for England in London, and reminds the young man not to forget where their loyalties lie.

It would be interesting to get more of the untold story of what foreign powers were influencing these Titans of American industry.",1377907200,,1196,5.020304568527918

5380580,5,B00A2XTJI4,"This is a very entertaining and informative series!!!  The narrator is very good and I really enjoyed learning about each man and the role he played in the history of our country.  My only complaints are that the intro is continually repeated after each break in the DVD.  And the other complaint is that the modern day ""experts"" aren't needed at all to comment on the great men who built America.  Some really poor choices are used.  What did Donny Deutch invent?  Jim Cramer made me laugh every time I saw his face and heard his high pitched voice talk about finance.  H.W. Brands is annoying on the dvds.  Also, Jack Welch was a CEO but these men built things and didn't just ""run"" an existing company like he did. Finally, Alan Greenspan was boring.  Fortunately, these so called ""experts"" are only used sparingly.  This DVD series is well worth watching and very good!",1377648000,,873,4.6103896103896105

5380590,1,B00A2XTJI4,"What a sad state of affairs things have come to when the History Channel finally condescends to produce a series concerning actual historical events, only to flip those occurrences on their proverbial heads and stomp them into the ground. I have come to expect some degree of revisionism from the vast majority of current television programs, but this was little more than thinly veiled socialist propaganda. For instance, despite the fact that the roles of our two oligarchical political parties were respectively reversed in 1870s America, the narrators somehow flipped history to make it appear that a certain party both then and today was actively engaged in repressing voter rights - never mind that as we move away from supercapitalism, workers must now be registered under one party to gain employment at union jobs. So not only faulty history, but hypocritical in the extreme.

What a great pity the facts were so distorted, and, to an extent, modernized to make applicable to our era, so that to anyone familiar with not necessarily the intricacies of these men's lives, but of the time period itself, nearly every sentence was misleading. Faults they certainly did have, and harsh were the lives of the working class, but from the historical point of view, America would likely still be or would just be rising from third world levels of poverty and lack of technology were it not for these wealthy - and yes, undeniably, ruthless - men. Through them we gained electric lighting, advances in science which they privately funded, and to completely ignore these fundamentals was an atrocity. To distort history to such a degree as to focus favorably on one political party, however, was unforgivable, and made the producers and narrators of this series guilty of the very thing they were rallying against in every episode.

This program was an insult to the intelligence of anyone who considers themselves a serious student of history. I am not bemoaning how this presented Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan Chase et al. in a dim light. Far from it. These were human beings who were as susceptible to corruption as the next man, and no documentary about their lives would be complete for the retraction of those facts. This essentially left out massive blocks of verifiable truths, however, and inserted pure agitprop in its stead. There is no place whatsoever for such political games in historical accounts.

Ironically, it is the History Channel - once one of the few channels I would watch back when television still did have some small amount of educational value - that has convinced me the Idiot Box has now utterly lived up to its name.",1376784000,22,2648,4.95945945945946

The way the information was laid out, and the way the men the History Channel cast for the parts of Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, and Vanderbilt played their pieces, it was fantastic. I am eighteen years old, and I will admit that I find most of the shows the channel has to be boring, but this was running all day about a week ago, and I decided to watch it. I was sitting there, and I was completely captivated. The way the series had the plot lines and the characters...you KNEW it was real, and that these people lived and changed this nation, but I felt like I was IN the story line. I watched as Carnegie sold to Rockefeller and I was agitated. I watched as the monopolies were smashed, and I was saddened. It was like a movie, as they showed the WHOLE series, and I watched from about 2 in the afternoon 'til about midnight. I have NEVER sat and watched a show for that long, and I have NEVER sat and watched commercials. I did not touch the remote for TEN hours, and I have not been able to get the show out of my head.

As an overview of some of the historical events that shaped America it was okay and if someone was looking for a place to start a historical inquiry of Morgan, Rockefeller or Carnegie it would be good starting point.

Whoever decided on each episode subject-matter must have thought that the potential audience would be made-up of absent-minded people since after what would have been a commercial break, it repeated (or reviewed as an Educator would say), most of the information from the previous few minutes. Essentially, I was watching the same episode chapter twice; once with the actors saying a few lines, a second time with a voice over. Additionally at the beginning of each weekly ""episode, it reviewed the previous weeks episode using the same footage over and over and over.

It was fairly well done - some of the acting was a little wooden but pretty good overall. I would have prefered a little more detail but it was far above average. This the kind of show the History Channel should concentrate on and skip some of the crap they have now.

I would recomend this anyone who like US history. This was a pleasant way to pass the time and learn a little too.

This is information which should be taught in schools around the country so that Americans have the appropriate appreciation of great men taking great risks.  Even though their lives and motivations - and possible greed - are exemplified, it is their determination which moved America into leadership of the world and the industrial revolution...and if we had not, the First World War may have had an entirely different outcome.",1368144000,,502,5.275

This series captured my attention by seeing the good and the bad of what these men accomplished. Clearly their ambition drove them to achieve great things, sometimes at a horrific cost. I would have liked to seen more about what they did in later years of life with their fortunes.. The format of a historical drama made the information engaging. With Amazon Prime,  I received the movie quickly and the Blu-ray was less expensive than the standard format.",1367452800,,615,4.694444444444445

5380687,4,B00A2XTJI4,"Fascinating history that deeply affects all of our lives to this day.  It was way too dramatically produced and delivered for my taste, and the narrator repeats his narration in a zillion different ways as a recap rythm for the viewer, which definately drives the point home, but for the astute viewer is can be numbing.  Glad to ge the story though.",1366761600,,350,4.629032258064516

5380693,4,B00A2XTJI4,"I found the Video to be factual but it was made for TV. I think there is a excessive amount of reiteration like one sees before and after a commercial break. That aside the dark and sinister sides of the titans was revealed but not the whole picture of why they originally staredt the businesses they did. Due to lack of laws in the business world at the time in America it was easy to dominate a certain sector. It's a good Blu-ray video for younger audiences, school.",1366329600,,469,4.340909090909091

5380700,5,B00A2XTJI4,An outstanding series which cleverly entwines the personalities and fortunes of Great American Capitalists. It is an exciting view of the dynamics of 19th Century American business and the personalities behind the events that led to America's emergence as a mighty economic power.

5380723,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Excellent series covering the explosive growth of big business, Railroads, Oil, Steel, and Banking, in the late 1800's. What the robber barons accomplishments was nothing short of amazing and has been acclaimed often and by many. But the ruthless and sometimes less than honorable methods and means by which they amassed their fortunes have most often been glossed over or completely ignored. This series sheds some light on the wheeling and dealing's of those tycoons in a time when there was virtually no government oversight or regulation. It serves to illustrates the unbridled use of money and power in the nearly ""anything goes"" atmosphere of the robber baron's business world. And sheds some light on why they were called ""Robber"" Baron's!

For example, the men featured in the documentary are referred to as the men who built America.  In every case these men invested in existing technologies in mature markets.  Those technologies were destined to change America whether it was these men or someone else.  Saying they built America is like saying Google, Facebook, and Apple are the creators of our modern economy.

It's more accurate and more educational and more enlightening to say that they successfully capitalized on the changing economic landscape rather than glorifying them as if these things wouldn't have happened without them.

5380726,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Cornelius Vanderbilt began by buying a ferry with a $100 loan, and then grew it into the largest private fleet in the world. He then sold all his ships and invested in railroads prior to the Civil War - sensing that railroads would revolutionize travel and transportation in the U.S. Ruthless tactics helped him acquire competitors - eg. he owned the only railroad bridge entering New York City, closed it to competitors, and then bought them out as they suffered. Vanderbilt also built Grand Central Depot, and owned 40% of U.S. railroads. He was victimized, however, trying to buy the Erie Railroad, the only line from NYC to Chicago, the latter then the fastest growing city. Gould and Fisk were mid-level managers at the Erie and took advantage of fine print that allowed selling new stock - the more Vanderbilt bought, the more they printed. Looking for a new play, Vanderbilt sensed that railroads were overbuilt and decided to corner the market on a new likely major source of railroad traffic - kerosene. Vanderbilt met with Rockefeller, then struggling - rather than roll over, however, Rockefeller promised to fill 60 train cars/day(despite a need for less than half that) for a 1/3 rate discount. Vanderbilt had to accept, under threat of Rockefeller going elsewhere.

Rockefeller, age 24, focused on refining because he saw drilling as gambling. He raised more money to buy up competitors and generated more volume than Vanderbilt could handle. By age 33 he had 90% of the refining market. Vanderbilt then joined forces with a major competitor to raise rates for Rockefeller, who in turn built 4,000 miles of pipeline. One-third of railroads went bankrupt, but Vanderbilt still thought he had a strong hand by controlling the only railroad between Pittsburgh and N.Y.C., a route with no pipeline and a Rockefeller refinery in Pittsburgh. Rockefeller countered by shutting down his Pittsburgh refinery, bankrupting that railroad.

Andrew Carnegie had risen from messenger boy at the railroad to top management when he was tasked with building a railroad bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis. Designers told him he'd have to use a series of short arches because iron wasn't strong enough for a long span. Carnegie realized this would block river traffic and wouldn't be acceptable - exploring alternatives he learned first of steel (then produced for only small items such as knives) and then the Bessemer process that reduced the time to make steel rail from two weeks to 15 minutes. Carnegie invested all he had and built such a plant and completed the bridge in 1873. The public, however, was not convinced the bridge was strong enough - taking advantage of a common belief that an elephant wouldn't cross an unsafe structure, Carnegie arranged for a parade to cross the bridge, led by an elephant. Soon his initial steel plant was unable to fill orders as builders saw steel as offering improved buildings - after bringing in more investors, Carnegie expanded. Then brought in Henry Frick, a coal mine operator with a ruthless reputation, to assure adequate supplies of coke and to cut costs, which he did.

Frick also helped found an exclusive club above Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Frick ignored pleas to strength what was then the world's largest earthen dam, and in fact weakened it by lowering the top to widen the path for carriages. The club owned the dam, but was never successfully held liable. Carnegie donated millions to help rebuild Johnstown, as well as building libraries across the U.S. and Carnegie Hall in NYC.

Carnegie continued to push to become more profitable, upgrading the Homestead Steel Works near Pittsburgh in 1892. Frick did the dirty work while Carnegie went to Scotland and played golf. Wages were reduced, the work day extended to 12 hours for six days/week, and accidents began happening. A fatal accident led to 2,000 workers barricading themselves inside the plant; Frick called in Pinkerton (more men and guns than the military), nine workers were killed, and the state militia called in to restore order. The public was outraged, Carnegie returned from Scotland and undermined Frick - who then tried fomenting a board coup to oust Carnegie. Carnegie instead pushed Frick out.

J.P. Morgan got his start by consolidating warring railroads, then became interested in Edison's light bulb. Morgan financed Edison's lighting part of Manhattan, envisioning being on the ground floor of a new industry. Instead, Westinghouse's AC system took the lead after the 1893 Chicago's World Fair. Westinghouse was unable to obtain additional financing due to the royalty agreement with Tesla; Tesla then tore it up and Westinghouse was back in the hunt. Morgan then threatened Westinghouse with an expensive (baseless) lawsuit over patent infringement, and Westinghouse capitulated, giving Morgan the patents. Morgan then pushed Edison out, converts the firm to AC, and renames it General Electric.

Meanwhile Rockefeller's kerosene business is being seriously threatened by electricity, and hires scientists to find a use for its then useless gasoline by-product. They found it - powering motors.",1364601600,,5136,5.144910179640719

In an environment where both have fallen into disrepute, I now appreciate how they came about.  I am a retired manager and CEO and have had my problems with unions and regulations over the years.  But I now see how business leaders have brought these problems on themselves through past outrageous behavior.

This series is totally engaging.  I watched several episodes at a time.  It shows both the upside and the downside of the free enterprise system, and provides both inspiring and cautionary tales to live by.  My only complaint is that it includes interviews with Donald Trump and Carley Fiorina, who I do not hold in high regard as business leaders.

5380732,3,B00A2XTJI4,"This series is currently being shown in Australia and I've enjoyed watching it. Waiting as I write for the Henry Ford episode.  It appears from many of the reviews the factual accounts are distorted and via another history channel production ""The Story of Electricity"" I did pick up that perhaps the Tesla/Westinghouse patent agreement may be also factually distorted before reading any of these reviews.

What a shame because I like almost everything else about the production. Now I'll have to take a second star from what was to be a four star review.

Oh yes! Why previously four stars but now only three?

Donald Trump.

The input of people like Trump into this series is a joke and detracts from it.
The modern day equivalents of these titans are innovators like Steve Jobs and people that took risk with something new and life changing ""not"" Donald Trump.

Trump can put his name on as many buildings as he likes but his innovative ability extends no further than his hairstyle and you can all put your own star rating on that.",1363910400,7,1034,4.685082872928176

5380750,2,B00A2XTJI4,"I have to think that the people who gave this series glowing reviews probably didn't know much about the actual history of this era when they saw it, and assumed it was accurate.  If you are one of those people, you've been cheated.  I was very much looking forward to this series when I saw it advertised, but was extremely disappointed to find that it is exactly the kind of inept and inaccurate ""edutainment"" that makes the US educational system such a joke.  Even Wikipedia is a better resource than this series, and that scares me.  The only thing this series has going for it is nice computer graphics that visually reconstruct some of the cities of the time, but this is pointless if there is no substance behind it.  I could have done without the obnoxious soundtrack and over-the-top dramatic recreations, but they would be fine if they had gotten the history correct.

Please realize that I am not whining about minute or irrelevant details.  This series doesn't even get the basic facts right in many places, and frequently leaves out extremely important items that distort the history or mislead the viewer by their absence.  Furthermore, except in a few cases, the series pretty much ignores the way these men's ambitions affected the lives of people who worked for them, and the ways that the rise of organized labor continually influenced the way they ran their companies.  It nearly portrays these men as if they were working in a God-like vaccuum, which was not the case.  Of course, you shouldn't just take my word for it - do a little legitimate reading on the topic and you will see how badly this series represents many of the important events and people.  (To get you started, I seem to remember the account of the Gould-Vanderbilt watered-stock incident being particularly terrible, as was most of the material on Andrew Carnegie.)

With 10 hours of programming time, there's simply no reason not to get this stuff right.  It's just ignorance, laziness, and an emphasis on entertainment over substance.  I guess this is pretty much par for the course these days, especially for the History Channel and it's partner networks.  I suppose I should just be thankful that there's no mention of UFOs, Bigfoot, or Ancient Aliens in the series, since the majority of programming on these channels these days seems to consist of that kind of garbage.  If you are really interested in the history of business or the guided age, then avoid this series at all costs and read books.",1362528000,16,2492,4.773892773892774

I and my family learned a lot about early american history that we did not know, especially concerning the men involved with this story.  It was fun to see how the destiny of these men was intertwined.  My only complaint about the DVD series is that it would have been better if they had taken a little extra time to blend together each section without the commercial recap of what had already occurred.  Every 8-10 minutes, there is a 2 minute recap of what had previously occurred, presumably after coming back from the commercial break for the TV series.  This is not necessary when you have been watching the DVD series from the beginning.  I would assume this could have fairly easily been edited out for the DVD, but wasn't.  They also filmed some time period scenes from the late 1800's that were shown repeatedly throughout the series.  After watching the first 5-6 episodes, some of these scenes can ""get old"", but this does not detract from the enjoyment of the series.  I would have also liked to seen more on Henry Ford.  The focus of this series was basically how his life and early start to Ford was affected by the things that Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Morgan did, but not much focus on how Ford revolutionized the production line.  The segment on Ford seemed a little rushed to end the series on time.  Definitely worth the purchase.

5380764,1,B00A2XTJI4,"From the previous reviews, I thought that this set of videos would explain the pros and cons of each businessman's life and promote values of fairness and equality.  Far from it!  The set seems to go out of its way to explain why each businessman made it to the top by cheating others.  Vanderbilt stopped trains short of a station, Rockefeller made it hard for small businessmen, and so on.

The second reason I didn't like this set is that I thought it was not that great historically.  There was quite an effort to make things look like the times in which these men lived and worked, but it could have been better done.  These are supposed to be American businessmen, but several trains in the set had distinct European looks.  Ford didn't win a race on a country road with green lawns on each side.  And so on.

5380784,1,B00A2XTJI4,"First;  the introductory singer and his musical backers...if you can call it that, shows why we have sunk to the lowest common denominator, and why today's children, and their posterity will never be interested in American history.  The introduction blasts your ear with a bizarre sounding noisey menage of guitars and a voice that belongs in the gutter somewhere, no offense intended to the person who sung for this drip! This poorly made ""historical"" movie is long on re created shots, short on facts, sequences, woefully bad in regard to period clothing, how these men looked in their youth, terribly bad in regard to the dialogue between them, and lousy interviews laced in the cut- aways.  SECOND:  Mark Cuban, pardon me, has about as much respect for history as Attila the Hun, meaning none.  His diatribe contributes nothing to the enlightenment of the viewer, except to to give his funky smurky shrugging comments that suggest his overt abject  indifference to any dialogue that speaks to history on a serious level.  Cuban is the latter-day jackal with no regard nor respect for the republic on which he stands.  His comments are inauspicious to say the least.  Charles Schwab is reduced to a screen appearance more out of mention of an ancestor, than for any historical facts he can offer.  His dressed-down appearance speaks volumes of how far he too has gone to placate the gangsta-funkers who insist that everybody who does one of these ""modern day"" videos, speak on camera dressed in hideous black, pajamas, jeans,cut away tee shirts, and never look at the camera directly.  Schwab was once an impeccable dresser who spoke volumes to honesty and still does.  The end of formal dress wear in exchange for pajamas, nappy hair dos, funky tee shirts, and ""anything goes including the F -bomb"" is the undoing of this once-great Nation that feeds today's generation of smart phone gangstas the notion that even history can be told in short cuts.

For analysis: John D. Rockefeller and Carnegie were far more friendly in real life, especially in their middle age years, than this video suggests.  The video points incorrectly to the twi-light years of the barons as the time they ""came together"" by mutual interests.  Not so.  JP Morgan was an obsessed grubber who was particularly sensitive to his bulbous nose appearance, and shied away from public because of his self proclaimed grotesqueness, but this is not touched upon anywhere, and this alone created an isolated-destructive monster that was this fellow during his formative years.  While ti can not be argued that these men owned America, they also got assistance from the elites who made up the ""permanent government"" of that era, Elihu Root, Robert T. Lincoln,  My advice to you the reader of this critique? Skip this drip DVD set,  and save your money.  Men Who Made America is a bust! Big time!  Probably was scraped together to make loot for the looters of this poorly made drivel.  Don't buy it, you will lament it after you view this flop which is a gross waste of your time.

5380793,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I caught this program on the History Channel two nights ago.  It's one of the better documentaries I've seen on the History Channel.  It really held my attention.  Of course, it helps that I've always been interested in this time period in American History - the Gilded Age, the Age of Enterprise, the progressive era, etc.

This documentary does in depth about the great business titans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The label of ""robber baron"" has been attached to the great business titans of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a label that basically means ""ruthless businessman"" and ""filthy rich"".  Indeed, the reality was that during their heyday, before anti-trust laws, before Theodore Roosevelt became an unexpected and trust-busting president, these business titans were in fact ruthless and competitive businessmen trying to gain as much power and wealth as possible while monopolizing entire industries.  When the anti-big business William Jennings Bryan ran for president in 1896, these titans felt so threatened that they did the unprecedented by putting down their gloves and teaming up together to try to get William McKinley elected president for the simple fact that McKinley was pro-big business while Bryan was not.  The strategy worked, as these titans contributed millions of dollars to the McKinley campaign.  By 1900, Theodore Roosevelt, a young rising star in politics, held anti-trust views that made these titans nervous, so they set out to derail Roosevelt's momentum and agenda by trying to get him on the McKinley ticket in the 1900 presidential election so he could be a powerless Vice President under President William McKinley.  Once again, the strategy worked, but McKinley's assassination in 1901 made Roosevelt an unexpected - and feared - President of the United States who was out to break the trusts.  Understandably, this documentary exposes the cold truth, the ruthlessness of these men during the time when the absence of anti-trust laws allowed them to get away with monopolizing industries and having ruthless business practices, as well as the anti-trust climate of the 1890s and 1900s.  The documentary depicts reality and events in chronological order.  When Roosevelt became president, it was the beginning of the end of the long party the great business titans were enjoying for decades.  Mention is even made about the progressive movement as well.  Of course, the passage of time and revisionism beginning in the 1930s and 1940s has helped portray these men more as ""industrial statesmen"", men who helped build the nation and whose industries helped America win wars via use of oil, steel, electricity, etc., not to mention the philanthropy of these men.  So the old debate still rages - were these men ""robber barons"" or ""industrial statesmen""?

This documentary features Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, and Henry Ford.  In addition, Jay Gould, George Westinghouse, Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and others are featured.  Carnegie, Morgan, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt, and Gould all have been labeled ""robber barons"" many times throughout history.  Ford, on the other hand, was viewed in a more favorable light due to the fact that he was producing a product that he wanted the common man to be able to afford.  However, despite whatever label, good or bad, has been attached to these men, they all had one thing in common that's indisputable - they helped build America into a superpower.  The documentary also features interviews with current and former CEOs and founders of American corporations and businesses, such as Donald Trump, Donny Deutsch, Steve Case, Mark Cuban, and that Jack Welch guy from General Electric.  The series is narrated by Campbell Scott and I thought he did a good job except for a mispronunciation or two.  The cinematography was very good.

They spelled Grosse Pointe, Michigan wrong.

I didn't like that a full recap was done after every commercial break about what we had seen up until that point.  It happened after every commercial break and was extremely repetitious and time consuming.  I didn't care for the music by Blues Saraceno.  It didn't ""fit"" at all.

Some of the shady things these business titans were up to during their heyday has been emulated by the corporate elitists of today.  Just think of what happens with presidential elections of the current day.

Overall, though, this is a great documentary that I rate at 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5.  I highly recommend watching it.",1359763200,66,4555,5.162125340599455

I appreciate that some of these men are getting more attention, and a dramatic treatment.
However there are too many historical distortions.
If Fisk and Gould were ""stuck in middle management"" at the Erie, how could they water the stock?
And no mention of Daniel Drew, a key part of the Erie War.
The program implies that the Commodore was THE controller of the US railroad industry, and generally savaged his competition.  When in fact his empire was always second fiddle to the Pennsylvania Railroad, the largest and most profitable of the big eastern lines.
I realize some simplification may be required to fit TV time constraints, but hyperbole is not required.
Maybe use some of the time taken to recap prior shows to straighten out the history?
Lastly, the presence of Donald Trump, Donny Deutsch, Ted Turner, Jack Welch, and others borders on the bizarre.
While some of these people are interesting in themselves, there is no evidence of their history licks.
Read Welch's book and you would think GE began with him, or at most with his predecessor, not the great pioneering CEO Charles Coffin.
Even the much better historian talking heads interrupt the flow of the dramatization.
If I just want good acting and inspiration, I might as well go back to classics like Young Tom Edison, the old Alexander Graham Bell movie, Pittsburgh with John Wayne, or Union Pacific.

5380805,2,B00A2XTJI4,"I happened to watch the series ""The Men Who Built America"" on one of the so called ""learning channels"". Now, while shopping for a few more books, I happened upon the sale of the DVD ""The Men Who Built America"". I decided to write a review but first I read the reviews already made and was sadly disappointed in the reviews given by most people about the series. Most gave the series high marks but the few who actually know their history were not so generous. As usual people who do not read, study, or learn, get their education from Hollywood and other movie makers by these visual stories. The facts in this series however, were often at least distorted and mostly outright inaccurate and wrong. I give the series only two stars only for entertainment value. While the series is being shown they cut away to commentary by heirs, or business people about the subject being shown. The commentary (by some who were heirs) was unkind to say the least. The commentary by a Rockefeller heir slammed their ancestor John D., saying ""they are not proud of the way he earned their money"" yet the heirs don't give up what they inherited, they only manage the great endowments that was left to humanity by their ancestors . The heirs were often pure hypocrites like the Rockefeller heirs were in their commentary. The other commentators (big business leaders of today) took the angle that was trying to be portrayed-personal greed (nothing of their great creations or contributions to the advancement of society) and they played along with it while feeding their own egos. They call these great men ""Robber Barons"" but if you read what they did and what they accomplished they were truly remarkable men; all with the same flaws we all have but few if any were criminal in their intent even by today's standards. The series depicted these men(most of whom were great and behaved like everyone else of that time, (many behaved much more honorably than most others of the time) as greedy whose ambition was only to become wealthier than the other achievers. Nothing was mentioned about Rockefeller founding an institute for infectious disease, the Spellman Seminary to educate freed women slaves and their daughters, or of the founding of The University of Chicago, or of Morgan bailing out the USA, or of Vanderbilt building a steamship line and a route to the Pacific through Nicaragua prior to the construction of the Panama canal while dealing with the elimination of an American terrorist who, by a coup d'etat,  took control of the government of Nicaragua. Or of the Warburgs who were involved in negotiating the Treaty of Versailles prior to WWII and of Paul Warburg and JP Morgan helping to create Federal Reserve System and the U.S. Central Bank. I suggest reading the books sold here at Amazon written by Ron Chernow: ""Titan"", ""The Warburgs"", ""The House of Morgan"" and the book ""Vanderbilt"" written by T.J. Stiles. These books are extremely well researched, inexpensive, long (700-800 pages which is great) and some of the best books I've ever read. They are packed with real history and told in a way that you can almost smell the odors in the air at the time, and feel the constant mud stuck to your shoes at the time. But, if you just want to be effortlessly entertained and care not about knowledge or true history, then just put your mind in neutral, play the DVD, and float along like a jelly fish in whatever direction that the cheapish series wants to take you. Just my take.

5380814,1,B00A2XTJI4,"History Channel's, ""The Men Who Built America"" (no women?), is entertaining TV viewing. But a must-have for history and documentary buffs, it's not. If one is considering purchasing this series, there are some glaring problems to be aware of.

One thing about the series that bothers me immensely are the multiple story summaries that occur after what would be the commercial breaks when it aired on commercial cable TV.

Granted, episode summaries after commercial breaks are common in TV programs. They're there mainly for viewers who are just tuning in. The problem that this creates for a show that is purchased and watched in its entirety, or an episode at a time, is that the viewer is bombarded with these summaries every ten minutes.

This series is even worse than most. It seems that every summary is at least a minute or two long and doesn't just rehash what's been viewed so far in the current episode, but goes over what has happened up to that point in the entire series. While watching, I began to suspect that in the final episode, these summaries would be so long that they would need their own episode. Would it have cost the producers so much to edit these pieces out for the purchasing customer? I suppose they were afraid that if they did, each episode would only be ten minutes long.

Another problem was in the episode about Andrew Carnegie, although it occurred in any episode that the narrator, Campbell Scott, mentioned Carnegie. Every single expert interviewed in the show pronounced Carnegie properly, the way Carnegie himself pronounced it, Car-n-gie. But Scott pronounced it each and every time, Cr-ne-gie. Even the actors pronounced it properly!

It may sound like nit-picking to many, but these kind of historical inaccuracies, and there are others, make history buffs like myself cringe. I don't blame the narrator for this faux pas. The fault lies with the producers who were too lazy to correct such a glaring inconsistency.

This kind of error betrays the real purpose of this so-called documentary. Not to truly educate while entertaining, but to simply entertain. Not that there's anything wrong with that, if that's what you're looking for in a television program. But if you're looking for an historically accurate documentary, look elsewhere.

In the episode about electricity, the writers didn't even bother to get the scientific facts right. Part of the story was about the Niagara Power Company trying to decide which kind of electricity they would produce, AC or DC. The narrator stated that they hadn't decided which system, AC or DC, would POWER their generators! This ridiculous assertion was repeated later in the same episode.

Now, I don't have a huge understanding about electricity, but even I know that it's the WATER that powers the generators, and the system, AC or DC, which is used to transmit the electricity generated by the power plant. This laughable mistake made it almost impossible for me to watch the rest of the series with any faith that anything presented in it had any accuracy at all.

I must say, minus the incessant reminders of what has preceded, and the occasional error in basic physics, the series is quite entertaining. The ""recre-actors"" are above average in their abilities as thespians, and the production values rank right up there with the best Hollywood has to offer. Michael Bay himself couldn't have created a more harrowing dam bursting scene. But then, that's the whole problem with shows like these, for people like me, who are looking for more than entertainment value. Or at least, the proper pronunciation of one of the major players' name.

Now I'll address a serious problem with the series that is very subtle, insidious and reaks of an agenda. Every single one of these powerful and rich men are somehow made out to look evil. The producers do everything except dress the main characters in Darth Vader's cloak and cowl, and having them speak in deep voices with asthmatic breathing. If I saw one more scene of Rockefeller walking toward the camera in slow motion with his long overcoat blowing out behind him, I was going to throw a lit bottle of kerosene at my TV!

The competition for these men don't just inspire innovation, no, the competition must be destroyed by any means necessary. Nothing is ever accomplished or created because of the sheer genius of these men, or the wish to better society. It's all done with one motivation...to destroy the other guy.

How dare these men innovate ways to save or make more money thus taking it out of the hands of the other guy. The innovations created, such as the pipelines that facilitated a more efficient way to move oil across the country, or the first bridge to span the Mississippi River, are not celebrated, but presented as the deeds of these evil villains to get revenge on the other guy for daring to make more money.

I'm not naive. I know there was a lot of that. But there's a strong emphasis in this series on the unethical, immoral, illegal methods these men used to beat the life out of each other. Absolutely nothing is done out of pure altruism. There's always a dark ulterior motive. Even when, after the flood, Carnegie donates millions of dollars to rebuild the town, it's only done to resuscitate his image.

I doubt if the producers set out to make this a hit piece on these pioneers of industry. It's more dangerous and less apparent to the viewer than that. The ideals and beliefs just seep into the script without there being a conscience effort to do so. This makes it far less obvious and far more effective. It's the best kind of propaganda.

Unfortunately, the History Channel has suffered lately with what I'll call, lowest-common-denominatoritis. It's the same affliction that has affected all the other so-called niche cable channels. The glut of reality programming is produced as a result of this disease. I can't even begin to tell you what most of the programs that air on History have to do with history, except for the fact that when they're done, they're history. Except, of course, until they're rerun.

I suppose every now and then, they have to produce programming such as The Men..., to remind themselves what channel they work for. Remember when TLC was actually The Learning Channel? Who, besides old-timers like myself, knows that A&E stands for Arts and Entertainment? No, children, it doesn't stand for Anything and Everything. Well, maybe now it does.

I guess there will have to be new niche cable channels, perhaps, The REAL History Channel, The REAL Learning Channel, The REAL Discovery Channel, etc. One can hope.",1356652800,33,6613,4.858792184724689

It was interesting to see the evolution of men into monsters - willing to close down plants and cut wages without a second thought about the employees in order to increase control of the markets and further their own interests against their enemies.  It was an informative and entertaining series if one is able to use a fast-forward control.  An inadvertently humorous note is the constant use of having the men walking in slow motion while narration is presented and always using the same shots for it; after a bit, my mind started to wonder if they all had some movement disorder.  The aging process was poorly handled - the men went from staying the same age to suddenly looking like Rip Van Winkle.",1354492800,8,936,4.746913580246914
5380822,5,B00A2XTJI4,"By far and away, the most well done documentary I've ever seen. Pace is just right, moves quickly enough to keep your interest, yet covers each point very, very well. Narration, acting, scenery/sets, lighting, editing, dialogue, information, all 10 stars, very realistic. Very interesting subject matter, at least to me, learned things I never knew. Hard for me to know, but sure seemed to me that they painted these guys as realistic as possible - giving them credit for being smart, ambitious, willing to take risks, and extremely competitive, while acknowledging their greed, without outright trashing them in the town square for it.

The writers and director leave it to us to decide where we draw our personal line as far as monopolistic power itself, in an age when when dealing with it both morally as well as legally, was still largely new to the US government and its people.",1354406400,42,884,4.8933333333333335
5380823,3,B00A2XTJI4,"I generally enjoyed the show and how it ties together the stories of the various robber barons of the late 19th/early 20th centuries. But I was kind of irked at how some of the historical details were distorted. For instance, they got the whole Homestead strike/battle wrong. If you just watched the show you would think that the Pinkertons just walked up to the striking steelworkers at Homestead and opened fire. Historically, there was a battle in that the strikers themselves were armed too. The Pinkertons were trying to land in barges and were actually forced to surrender! Why change that? I don't think it was for any political/ideological reason that I could tell. But it's like they tried to simplify things so much that it actually distorts what happened. It makes me wonder what else in the series is not quite the way it happened. I realize in making a show about such a large topic that you can't throw in every detail but in trying to oversimplify it, it does a disservice to history. So I enjoy the series for tying together some parts of history that I didn't know about and making me want to read more, but at the same time I am disappointed at some of the details they get wrong.",1354060800,346,1198,4.550925925925926
5380824,5,B00A2XTJI4,"I stayed up one night until almost 2am trying to finish watching this show on History channel (since I don't have a DVR)!  I couldn't finish the show that night.  And I am looking so forward to buying this set of disc to learn more about America.  I believe that anyone, specially children or immigrant like me, should watch this show!  So much to appreciate how this country was really built, based on hard work, risk taking, ingenuity, creativity and capitalism.  It also shows the down side of capitalism also when greed and power overcame the few elites in the country.  This is a very great documentary!  Must watch!",1353888000,17,621,4.6422018348623855
5380825,5,B00A2XTJI4,"Having been born and raised in the Industrial river valleys of SW Pennsylvania, (Pittsburgh) in the forties and fifties, it filled a gap in my understanding about how it all came about. To say one way or the other as to how great/awful the then Captains of industry where, is an historical interpretation.
One would need to study in depth, ""all"" the effects it had, on more than just economics, (child labor, pollution, inside trading, etc..etc.  In the evolution of time, we can now look back and compose a documentary that explains some of the financial progression it seems to have made. It's always been a belief of mine that Carnegie, among them, understood full well the downside of the march to wealth he obtained. Hence his giving great portions of his wealth away...Libraries, Universities, Pension funds, Health care..etc... All in all it added a wealth of knowledge to my understanding about my childhood homeland. That said...buy the video-
