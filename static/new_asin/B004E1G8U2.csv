I'm glad that I only bought one of the series.  The entire set cost a hundred bucks and a waste of money beyond entertainment value.  It's fun to watch the guy in action but useless for learning much.  Go to YouTube and learn a lot for free or search the web or Amazon for good books on guitar.",1417824000,,428,4.035714285714286
