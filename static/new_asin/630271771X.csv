497691,5,630271771X,This is perhaps the best depiction of a creative version of heaven and the bible prophecies that I have ever seen on film. I would love to see a updated version of this movie with a summary of authentic changes that would be more of a accurate account of hebrew history.

497746,5,630271771X,"I found this movie on TV by accident on MLK day - I absolutely LOVED it.  I was raised in the Lutheran Church, about 60 years ago, and LOVED how the bible stories were portrayed so cleverly in Depression days of the South.  So creative!  Beautifully done, NOT politically correct, thank goodness, just downright wonderful.  Perhaps a bit childlike, but still splendid, backed up a beautiful choir, perhaps angels singing.  I loved how the angel cleaning ladies had their wings covered to keep them clean - there were many scenes, so cleverly portrayed, I wondered with admiration at the creative writers.  Loved how the sinners were portrayed, even Pharoah and his entourage blended in so reasonably with modern times. Noah filling the ark, was magical, with Noah, checking his long list of animals.  The word of the Lord was clear and strong to the sinners.  The movie is told from a Preacher's background, talking to the children's Sunday School Class, explaining the Bible Stores to them.  There was a LOT of astonishing work put into the movie, and many, many scenes.  Scenery was simple and unsophisticated, which takes NOTHING from the story.  My days activities were put on hold so I could watch the movie to the end.",1453075200,,1224,4.836538461538462

497803,5,630271771X,"This was also one of my favorite childhood movies and captured the spiritual essence of Sunday school Bible stories as faithfully - if not more - than any of MGM's megabudget biblical epics.  The film is not so much racist as corny, even when it came out.  But it does reproduce the culture of its time and place, offering insight into how ordinary people adapt great myths to illuminate their own lives.  Marc Connelly based it on Roark Bradford's collection of fables, ""Old Man Adam and His Chillun,"" originally gathered on Bee Bend Plantation on Red River, between Benton and Bossier City.  I can recall that even in the 1980s traces of this culture remained, and it wasn't hard to imagine De Lawd still walking the bottomland cottonfields at twilight.  Sadly, all this is now buried under suburban sprawl.  Does De Lawd yet walk among the housing tracts and big box stores with the same fierce love?",1439942400,8,903,4.719745222929936

497908,5,630271771X,"I love this movie!!  You laugh; you cry; you cringe a bit - but it's a great movie.  There are deep truths that underlie the story that only those who know the Bible will probably detect.  It's NOT a source from which to obtain good theology or watch with critical eye.  The way that it is told, it is a fanciful FABLE as described in the credits.  So it is what it is.  But if you want to look at the Old Testament stories through the imaginative eyes of a young Sunday School student in the old deep south, it will open your heart to a different viewpoint and you MAY discover some unexpected revelations about people that can make you weep with the depth of thought expressed, for instance:  ""What does God look like?""

This movie is a testament of the Black reality of wanting to become movie stars and the white man's idea of what Black America was about in 1930s U.S.A.  The actor's abilities resonate on screen like the sun rising in early morning; the white studio's mis-understanding of Black culture is evident in the depictions of the Black characters, as well.  This is not a film to look upon with narrow vision, rather, it is a film to look upon with the understanding that the movie was made: 1) by white people with an ultimate goal of profit; 2) to showcase Black talent rarely seen outside of New York City by both Black and white audiences; and, 3) made in a way to edit out positive Black performances that were not roles of servitude such as maids, butlers, pimps, prostitutes, and other lesser characters of society when the movie was shown in the south.

Green Pastures, a film worth watching, is a testament of the talent of Black actors in the era, as well as a documented fact of the distorted perceptions of white people about Black people in 1930s America.",1283040000,2,1180,4.474418604651163

Then reflect on how far we've progressed as a society. When you start to feel good again, THEN and ONLY THEN should you press ""play.""

Rex Ingram, who plays several roles,but the major role as 'De Lawd. Has such a kind face that I truely can picture the LAWD as him!! Several major points in the BIBLE are acted out through the rumination of a little boy in Sunday School. Yes, the visions of heaven as a ""fish-fry"" & stereotypical thinking of 1930s racism, that throw the mental capabilities of the African Americans into the ""challenged"" category, makes you want to scream. But, the underlying lessons learned of corruption, disobedience,sexual immortality, & more sins against the LAWD are certainly prevelant today. This movie is brilliantly produced for its time.

No, they did NOT wear suits and ties and carry guns around in Old Testament days. Trust me. Better yet, look it up! And God is portrayed near the end of the film as a confused, almost stupid Being. That part disturbed me, but most of this is very good entertainment and meant to be just that....period.

I just enjoyed it for the musical comedy and parable it was, nothing more. The grammar in here is so bad, and the story so ludicrous.....you just have to laugh out loud.

Marc Connelly's play debuted on Broadway in 1930, ran for eighteen months, enjoyed a five year national tour and won the Pulitzer Prize.  Unfortunately, today, it's political incorrectness and racial stereotypes makes one want to cringe.

Directed by Connelly and William Keighley, the 1936 film, which features an all-black cast, looks at stories in the Old Testament as they might be imagined by black school children living in rural Louisiana.  God, for example, is referred to as ""de Lawd,"" and takes the form of an elderly black preacher (Rex Ingram).

Perhaps the best story in this episodic fable concerns Noah and the flood.  Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, certainly one of the finest comedic performers of his time, plays the good man who builds the Ark.

The Hall Johnson Choir supplies lovely Gospel music throughout the picture, which is, at the end of the day, a fine piece of theatre that should be viewed as a film of its time.

DVD extras include audio commentary by actor LeVar Burton and some black cultural scholars, plus two musical shorts, one featuring Ethel Waters and 7-year-old Sammy Davis Jr., and the other with The Nicholas Brothers.

498081,4,630271771X,"When we know the author of the original stories is white, the film shows perfectly well how the American society, after slavery and after - up to the 1850s - banning the Blacks from all training into reading and writing, from all speaking their original languages and even from all affiliation to any religion, rushes head first into over-Christianizing the Blacks with no cautious slowing down and with all calculated speeding up they could master after the Secession War, both south and north, though for different reasons.

The objective was to cast the Blacks into the mold of the unexplainable will of God and the necessity to suffer in this world to be saved in the next one. The interest of this film cannot be found in the ethics of the story. Maybe only - at this level - in the exploration of the arcane sophistication of the alienation, imposed onto the Blacks.

But the real interest is the large presence of Negro spirituals in the film, one of the very first films entirely centered on Black music, though in 1936 we must not forget we are after - and within - the triumph of the radio that enabled Black music and jazz to find a wide audience, to embed its existence and force into the widest Black and white audience it had ever had, just as it enabled F. D. Roosevelt to dominate the political arena for twelve years or so. Yet the film is tremendously deficient.

The desire to have only Black actors in the film locks up the Blacks in a color ghetto. It appears as pure segregation against the whites. It does not help us much understand the great musical revolution the Blacks brought to the American continent. They live their music, their religion and their everyday life in the total absence of whites except in one scene where the whites are Ku Klux Klan members lynching a whole bunch of Blacks for no other apparent reason than the excitement of the hunt.

At times the biblical stories told to us are so naive and simple-minded that we can wonder whether we are talking to people provided with a brain. The music itself is very average. Luckily this exclusively Black cinema has not been furthered beyond the few films the late 1920s and the 1930s produced. They were leading to a complete dead end as for understanding or simply reflecting the real situation in which the Blacks are living and which they may want to change. What's more the reduction of the whites to KKK members is definitely a racist caricature.

A visiting Ugandan Anglican priest spent the night at our home in the 1980s, and we asked if he'd like to watch this movie.  This black man who had struggled through Amin's regime and the next government, and whose home had been raided twice, understood both the humor and the tenderness.

On the other hand, the cast is made up exclusively of Black American actors whose vocabulary, grammar and diction unnerves us with its' stereotypic delivery.  This ""Ise gwanna do it"" sort of talk is usually what gives many American films of the 30's a bad name.  What are we to make of a film that is nothing but political incorrectness from beging to end while also serving as a wonderful folktale version of a number of the key stories from the Holy Book.

Rightly or wrongly, the directors, Marc Connelly and William Keighly took the belittling racial stereotypes of their day and used them to tell a childlike story with adults roles.  By suggesting Black adults as having the understanding of a child (and, more significantly, the faith of a child), we get a look at a Christian set of Biblical morality plays that are unlike anything I've seen on the screen before.  Part of us wants to rebel at the depiction of the characters in this movie while the other part of us is buoyed by the beauty of the film.  The acting is very good and the script, given the aforementioned disclaimer, is excellent.

  Set in New Orleans (you'll hear references to Canal Street and Rampart Street), this is the story of the Old Testament as told to a Sunday school class by a gentle and dignified old preacher.  So what if his grammar and diction aren't ""PC""?!  I live in New Orleans and I frequently hear people speaking this same way some seventy years after this movie was made.

  From Adam and Eve to the Exodus to Noah and the Great Flood, all of the stories are acted out in a ""modern"" setting.  There are some scenes in Heaven that have been decried as ""racist"" for their stereotypical presentation but all I saw were people in Heaven having a good time.  (I don't view my movies through an agendized prism and besides, if I were running Heaven, there would indeed be a barbeque going 24/7)

  As with most old, low-budget movies, the special effects aren't impressive but so what?  The scene where Noah's ark comes to rest was obviously done with miniatures but the overall effect is charming. (I know I use that word frequently but it's fitting)

  This movie is historic in that it features an all-black cast and unlike the 1923 version of ""The Ten Commandments"", the Biblical icons portrayed here seem down-to-Earth and human as opposed to overly emotive caricatures.

Like LeVar Burton, I also found it a little difficult to watch.  However, it has made such an impact in the history of film.  If you have little children, it would be best to explain why the movie was made this way, and why the actors portrayed the characters in that manner.

It's American black people, in their own cultural setting, being all people. Utterly brilliant. Rex Ingram's portrayal of God is inspired and moving, probably my favorite depiction of a major bible player (and it don't get more major than that!).

More remarkable, it's the least sanctimonious and stuffy, yet most true-feeling, telling of Bible stories around. Examples: instead of having a Pharaoh surrounded by empty grandeur the scenes with Moses in Egypt are transposed to a local Lodge Meeting full of empty symbols, self important high muckamucks and toadies--reality distilled to its essence; God, up in heaven, keeps his office simple and works from an old roll-top desk, he also worries a lot and wonders if he did the right thing.

498204,5,630271771X,"As a member of Roark Bradford's family, I'd like to share a couple of t5houghts.

First, it should be noted that Connelly's play was not ""suggested"" by Bradford's work but rather stolen from them by a house-guest who betrayed his host's hospitality. The family was outraged by this at the time. Nothing has changed.

Second, while Warner's disclaimer may be interesting, what it really reveals is a total unfamiliarity with Bradford as a writer and as a person. Bradford wrote down stories he heard from a minister, ""Preacher Wes,"" during his childhood. He loved the stories and wanted to share them with those who had not had an opportunity to hear them first-hand. To call him a racist is absurd.",1138147200,10,698,4.808333333333334
498235,4,630271771X,"This is a remarkable film in many ways.  The first thing that gets your attention is the introductory text, explaining that what we are about to see is how ""thousands of Negroes"" in the Deep South think of the stories in the Bible.  Such a very loaded statement, which is tricky in that there's nothing wrong with it as a story about a particular culture, but somewhat condescending in attitude towards its intended audience, which is obviously white.  The next thing that gets your attention is the fact that you are watching a movie made in the thirties that has an entirely black cast. That circumstance, combined with the introductory statement, has the effect of presenting the film as a novelty.  Yet the fact that it features many black actors who in other films are playing valets and house slaves means it cannot be entirely a bad thing.

You will be agog with disbelief as the film opens.  The stereotypes on the screen are sometimes too painful to watch.  But once you adjust and start watching the depiction of the various biblical stories the true power of the film steals across your mind and heart.  It really starts at Sunday school, when the children start asking their preacher typical questions that children would ask.  The preacher answers those that he can, then explains that the Bible doesn't have the answer to every question.  He then starts to tell some of the more prominent stories:  the creation, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood, Moses and Aaron's arrival at court, Joshua and Jericho (briefly), and the destruction of Babylon.  Eachs tory is told in a very approachable, with modern types in the character's roles. Very, very effective.

In this film, ""De Lawd"" creates Earth and humans more on a whim, and pretty much forgets about them.  Each time he visits he is disappointed in man's dissipated nature and develops ""schemes"" to improve his creation.  Mankind is essentially a lost cause, which prompts De Lawd to second guess himself and to despair of his creation.  He vows he will no longer deliver mankind, no matter how hard people pray.  In a fascinating twist, De Lawd meets a man Hezdrel --  who resembles Adam, who resembles De Lawd.  Hezdrel tells De Lawd, whom he thinks is merely a preacher, that man doesn't believe in the vengeful God anymore; their preachers talk of a merciful God.  De Lawd asks how Hezdrel knows of mercy, and Hezdrel responds that it is through suffering.  At the very end of the film, the angels in Heaven see a man being forced to ""carry that up the hill"" and that ""they're going to nail him to it"".  De Lawd then understands what faith and mercy are, and presumably that he should not give up on mankind.

One of the film's strong points is that although you may be familiar with the stories told, how they are told changes your perception.  The Moses story one such example.  In the Moses story, there is a great deal of focus on his arrival at Pharoah's court with Aaron.  Pharoah agrees to let the Hebrews go.  The next scene we see is of Moses at the edge of Canaan, his journey done and his eyesight leaving him.  The more spectacular aspects of the story are skipped over - no Red Sea parting, no Ten Commandments.  In this story de Lawd explains how he can lead Moses up the hill to heaven while still help Joshua at the walls of Jericho.  The Cain and Abel story likewise has a new perspective added to it.

Rex Ingram leads a stong cast of whom it is demanded they act nobly but with a twinkle of mischief.  All acquit themselves quite well.  There are some very charming scenes in the church (those kids are adorable) and in De Lawd's office.  The story of Noah and the flood is particularly engaging.  There is a running joke about aardvarks as well.  The Hall Johnson acts as a kind of Greek chorus in the proceedings.  It is both amusing and somewhat chilling to see De Lawd dressed up like an old Sourthern gentleman.  He brings Colonel Sanders to mind.

I would have given this film five stars but the stereotyping really is hard for me personally to ignore.  Sometimes you feel you may as well be watching happy slaves working in the fields.  But for the imagination and sincerity displayed, as well as its role in providing black actors an opportunity to stretch beyond the typical roles offered them, this is a very important and effective film.",1137888000,6,4351,4.591439688715953
498236,5,630271771X,"This DVD is an excellent package for viewing on a nice Sunday afternoon. Orignally, Roark Bradford's book ""Ol' Man Adam and His Chillun"" (from which this film is based) was a crude collection of old fashioned mockery of Black culture. This film greatly improves upon the original text. Yes, by modern standards, it's a tad stereotyped, but given the choice between this and ""Soul Plane""... need I say more?

Overall, the story is quite charming. The frame story involves Mr. Deeshay, a Louisiana Sunday School teacher who makes the stories of the Bible come alive for some plantation children. You'll wish your Sunday school teacher was this entertaining and interesting! The bit where Rex Ingram catches the boy shooting craps is a howl (I won't spoil it here, see for yourself) as well as the depiction of the world before the flood. It is a bit jarring to see the light-skinned black actress Edna May Harrris in blackface (guess Hollywood didn't think she was black enough), but that's one of the VERY few drawbacks of this charming and moving film.

As a lover of storytelling and a believer in the value of passing oral traditions as well as entertainment to the young, I treasure this movie.

Speaking of treasure, this also includes RUFUS JONES FOR PRESIDENT with blues legend Ethel Waters and 8 year old Sammy Davis Jr. Young Sammy runs for President (one campaign sign says ""Bring in the Blacks and Throw out the Reds!""). Once again, stereotyped humor abounds, but young Sammy's amazing dancing and the psersonality of Miss Waters makes it all worthwhile.

But as the film progressed and the simple, beautiful vision plays out, it's like the stories triumphs over all the 1930s Hollywood prejudice and takes us places few other films ever seem to approach.

Just to clarify the story ... it's supposed to be how one of the black children, hearing the story of Genesis for the first time, envisions it by placing all the Biblical characters in his or her environment. It's charming and funny and just a fine simple entertainment with some wonderful authentic gospel music ... and then ...

... and then Rex Ingram as ""Da Lawd"" visits earth to find out why men keep praying to him when he's long ago forsaken them. He meets a soldier named Hezdrel (Rex Ingram in another role) who explains how mankind as discoved mercy ... then he marches off to his death, leaving God standing there, stunned by the lesson he has just learned!

Suddenly, it's not funny or sweet any more but a powerful statement of faith ... a faith that overcomes the worst of Hollywood's prejudices and always leaves me gasping for breath as the scene in Heaven dissolves back to the Sunday School class and into one of the greatest single shots in movie history.

498241,5,630271771X,"I keep watching this film over & over again. It displays some of the very best cinematography in Black & White film making, I have ever seen. The film encompasses; Drama, comedy, visualizations & tremendous conversation of the old time south. The feeling of watching the all African - American cast, in a true southern depiction & context, is compelling to me. This is the time before the media introduced a rediculous control over what we, as Americans, can watch & enjoy as main stream filming.

I would love to see this & other classics of it's time being replayed on todays television a lot more frequently. To me, todays black film makers are to reluctant to create films of life, in much lesser, simpleminded & wholesome environment. I recommend for all ages,to be a "" must see "" motion picture.",1069891200,15,801,4.680851063829787
498242,5,630271771X,"This movie is a throwback to a better time; a time when political correctness didn't get in the way of a good laugh. It consists of bible stories seen through the eyes of poor Southern blacks in the 1930s.  You will roar with laughter as adorable pickaninnies ride clouds in Heaven and Noah debates with De Lawd about how many ""kegs o' likka"" he can take on the Ark.  My favorite scene is when Moses and Aaron confront Old King Pharaoh to demand that he ""let the Hebrew chillun' go.""  Moses is portrayed as a simple yet pious half-wit empowered by De Lawd with a magical walking stick and a few extra IQ points (okay, make that a lot of extra IQ points).  You will cheer when he gives the Pharaoh his comeuppance by showing him that you can't out-trick De Lawd.  Rex Ingram does some fine acting in his triple roles of De Lawd, Adam, and Hezdrel.  The scene where Hezdrel tells De Lawd about how mankind found ""moicy"" is heart-touching.  I wholeheartedly recommend this film to anyone interested in cinema the way it used to be, without the liberal bias and distortions of fact we are subjected to today.  So if you'd like an old-fashioned good time, just rare back with a ten-cent ceegar and a bottle of sonny-kick-mammy wine and pop this one in the VCR.  It's more fun than a fish-fry in Heaven!",1068076800,21,1297,4.438818565400844
498243,5,630271771X,"Well, Im settling for VHS although I really want it on DVD. This has got to be the best movie of all time...in my opinion of course. I saw this movie some years ago and Ive been looking for it ever since.  I was actually on my way to a church revival that night and this movie came on AMC so i watched it as i got dressed. I then found myself debating whether i should go to church late and see the end or go to church on time and see the movie later? This was during black history month so I was sure it would come on again.  Well I went to church hoping that Id catch the movie again another time and I never did because..OH WOW! I never caught the name of the movie. Ive spent my day today looking up every old African American movie I could find and I actually found it on someones list. Its a wonderful movie yall, funny as I don't know what although I doubt its meant to be.  The vernacular is what sealed it for me.  If you want to hear some real serious Ebonics, buy this movie!!  For real.  Gods name in the movie was Lawd!  I wish we could rate higher than 5 stars cuz I'd give this movie a 10!",1058486400,16,1104,3.9017857142857144
498244,5,630271771X,The first time I saw this movie I was about 15 yrs old and it was being shown late at night on AMC.  I stayed up until 6am watching this movie and I have never forgotten it.  It depicts the creation of the earth from an African-American perspective.  I have searched high and low for this and I feel blessed to have finally found it.  I'm hoping that it will be released on DVD soon.  Even though I have nearly replaced all my old VHS tapes I will definitly purchase this and cherish it.,1031184000,6,487,4.138297872340425

498266,5,630271771X,"I first saw this movie as a child, probably aged 5 or six, and I'd never forgotten it. For some reason, I had never been able to catch it on t.v., and as the years went by, it became very sketchy in my mind, but still there. Last night, about 44 years after the first time I viewed it, I had the profound pleasure of seeing it again. It was worth the wait.
The cast is spectacular, the sets charming and beautiful. It tells the story of creation, Adam and Eve, Noah ect, with a child-like simplicity. Often hilarious, sometimes very poignant and moving but always reverent, it illustrates what has given African Americans the strength to survive the tremendous struggles we have faced as a people. A simple, steadfast faith in God, who, for many of us, is as real as the sun, flowers, storms, and just as much a part of our every day lives. It is an awesome movie, and one that I think every one should see, at least once.",1023494400,17,922,4.304597701149425

teenager. I taped it off t.v. several years later. It was hard
finding the correct name. I now own a legal copy!
I had the pleasure of showing my parents this movie in '99 before they passed away. The writers take on the creation, as viewed through a black man's eyes was awesome. When God said, let me rare back and pass a miracle."" we all just laughed! When God created heaven and earth and there was just too much firmament, I thought we would all need CPR. It is a great family movie!

498268,5,630271771X,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion. I am very pleased it has lasted and not been blacklisted like Disney's 'Song Of The South'.  The black cast does speak with an overly Southern accent of the time, and that's what makes this so charming.  Rex Ingram is delightful as ""De Lawd"".  Don't miss Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson as Noah. (""I guess I can get de animals, Lawd.  There was a circus in town last week..."")

Movie is about the story basic characters in the bible: Adam and Eve, Moses,Jonah etc.....but with an all black, very great cast of actors.

498271,5,630271771X,"This awe-inspiring film has been one of my favorites since childhood, when I watched it on a Sunday morning that I was too sick to go to church (or did the Devil get in me? ).  Full of humor and precious moments, wonderful  performances, and simply amazing theatre-like staging; I've grown to  appreciate this movie more and more as I get older.  The all-black cast  rises far above the stereotypes which so easily could have ruined the film,  interestingly by seeming to apply the powerful lessons of humility and  loving obedience which De Lawd expects.
The memorable scenes are too  numerous to record, ranging from the powerful (De Lawd, in plantation-owner  finery, strolling through heaven, chanting  ""Has you been redeemed?  Has you been baptized?..."") to the hilarious (the angel Gabriel,  putting his lips to the horn, as he anticipates De Lawd's wrath).

498272,5,630271771X,"Although the movie starts off with a high ""Uncle Sambo"" level, this is quickly forgotten as spellbounding and classic scenes unfold in heaven and earth, with more thought-provoking and truly moving settings and  performances than many, many films since. Rex Ingram displays a quiet  power, rare sense of humour, and an even more rare sense of humanity as De  Lawd.  Memorable scenes: the creation (a picknick in Heaven), Noah  (""Forgive me for not recognizing you, Lawd. I should have known the  glory""), Mozes' last moment, leaving his flock to go into Israel and  the last scenes with God desperately trying to understand man.
