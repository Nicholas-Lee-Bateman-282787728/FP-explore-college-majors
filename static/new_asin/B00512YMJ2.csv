4519317,5,B00512YMJ2,This is the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of you seat. It is a movie well done with surprises throught out. It itnese drama makes you feel if you are there. Well done.,1381708800,,178,3.8378378378378377
4519318,4,B00512YMJ2,"This a well-paced fantasy about a Jew who turns the tables on the Nazis. I actually enjoyed it much more than Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, even if the acting is not as good. There's nothing wrong with a good ""yarn"" even when the setting is such a horrible time in history, and especially when the message is as sincere and unpretentious as this is. Don't believe the Rotten Tomatoes score on this one.",1378512000,,406,4.652777777777778
4519319,4,B00512YMJ2,"Very well made & entertaining. After having seen so many WW2 films & knowing how interested the Nazis were in art collections, I have to wonder whether this film was at least partially based on fact.",1377993600,,199,4.555555555555555
4519320,3,B00512YMJ2,"Watching this film was like watching an easter parade in slow motion, with stock pageant scenes, amateur actors, and lots of stuff that evokes ""Aha!"" via symbols but no emotion due to having been seen a zillion times before.

The actors are miscast, unsuited, below average in ability, and...weird. The father looks somehow like Carl Maulden; the son and protagonist like a fatish Billy Zane. Oddly, as the film progresses he shape-shifts to resemble a twin of Jon Lovitz, of SNL.

Briefly, none of these actors were endearing or inspiring or evoked the least ""Yay!"" or ""Oh, damn,"" or ""Wow,"" from me.

The film jumps from 1938 straight to 1943, with no fill-in whatsoever, no transition, and EVERYBODY LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME, like they just walked over to the next set and maybe changed clothes. The protagonist is somehow still alive in a concentration camp after all this time, and he's still fat! He's got almost the same barbered haircut and he still evokes no emotion in me whatever.

There are a couple of plot twists but more suited to a comedy. You might say, ""yeahhhhhh...well...maybe that could happen..."" but then you'll realize that no, it couldn't. Even the actors look self conscious at these ""twists,"" almost as if they don't know what to say next  to justify the ""plot.""

There's a story here, yes, but it's so weak and so hackneyed that there's no way it evokes the least concern or conflict. It's along lines of, ""If anything happens to me, my lawyer has a letter that he will release to..."" Yes, it's all that. It had me going, like, all, ""Jay-zus! Hurry it up so I can watch something else!""

Finally, in a rip-roaring action scene consisting of conversation we come to a plot point where it looks like the protagonist and the evil NAZI ex-buddy MIGHT both survive and profit by each flipping to the opposite side---annnnnnd----WHAM! CUT TO THE AMERICAN FLAG now draped outside of NAZI cop headquarters!

Wow!

With 13 minutes to go...

I will grant that the very ending had some flair and panache---I just wish the entire movie had been directed the same way, complete with really cool theme music. A pity, this could have been a much, much better film, along lines of good old style Euro-caper pics of the past. As you listen to the closing theme, you will see what I mean. Just imagine if the entire film had that same bounce and attitude.

The secret here is, THIS FILM SHOULD HAVE BEEN A COMEDY! It would have been GREAT!

Rent or buy this; you will enjoy it, I'm sure. I recommend it :)",1375142400,,2512,4.632882882882883

4519322,5,B00512YMJ2,"I saw this movie at a foreign film festival and fell in love with the movie, the story, the characters, the plot and the actors. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, suspense, and adventure mixed in with a little sarcastic lighthearted humor, played out in Austria & Germany during the end of Hitler's regime.",1370390400,,336,4.711864406779661
4519323,5,B00512YMJ2,"'Mein bester Freund' or in Enlgish, My Best Enemy, is a wonderful masterpiece that explores the complications between once 'close as brothers' friends becoming the worst of enemies. The movie begins with a reunion and then sharp reveal of Rudi's true identity as a Nazi. In time, a significant accident reverses their roles in society. The story reveals itself quite beautifully and paced just right. With black humour lingering around the movie, it isn't your usual WWII film about Jewish persecution.

From a movie enthusiast such as yourself, this film is great if you love movies with comedy, black humour, and want a WWII movie [that is based in Europe] with a happy ending for the persecuted Jews.",1366329600,8,703,4.9576271186440675
4519324,4,B00512YMJ2,"Mein bester Feind (My Best Enemy) is a very enjoyable drama, complete with a HAPPY ENDING, something so rare with movies about WWII Nazi persecution of Jews. The central story concerns the betrayal of the friendship between two ""blood brothers"", one an upper crust Viennese Jew, and the other the son of the Kaufmann family's maid. The ubiquitous Moritz Bleibtreu plays Victor Kaufmann, the son of a very prosperous jewish art dealer. As the story opens in 1938, Victor's ""foster brother"" Rudi has returned to Vienna, just days before the Nazis annexed Austria. To complicate matters, both guys are in love with the same woman, but she loves Victor. Rudi, unbeknownst to his best friend Victor, has joined the SS, and is ordered to retrieve a reputed Michelangelo drawing from the Kaufmann Family. Der Fuehrer intends to present to El Ducce the drawing, so as to cement their alliance. THat's the setup for a very entertaining, exciting story. MY BEST ENEMY has everything: a surprise Schadenfreude ending, best friends betraying each other, Nazi death camp drama, secret loves, mistaken idenities, hidden rooms filled with renascance treasures, WWII military drama, dark comedy, suspense...EVERYTHING!

The acting thruout is mostly believable, even if the script has so much mistaken idenity it smacks of increduity. Several themes are tackled, such as class warfare, idenity crisis, true vs apparent love, and appearance vs reality. The character of Rudi (played by the actor who was the lead character's ""best friend"" in GOODBYE LENIN) is especially interesting. In order to make it plain that Rudi doesnt have the education and breeding, of the wealthy Viensians he hopes to socialize with, he speaks with a dialect of Austrian german so thick, that I couldn't understand anything he said. (Everybody else spoke clear high german.) However, Rudi is such a distasteful character, so filled with greed, jealousy and spite, that its incomprehensible why Victor doesnt see right thru him. Of course, the relationship of the two guys, is also symbolic of the civilized, artistic german character (ie VICTOR), being betrayed and almost destroyed by low class Nazi thieves (Rudi). There's a problem with the script, that caused my increduity of these mistaken idenities, as well as the blindness of the Kaufmann family to Rudi's evil nature. (I cant be more explicit without giving away spoilers.) That's why I don't want to rate the film 5 stars. Of course, how the german nation didn't see thru the evil nature of Hitler and the Nazi party, is just as difficult to believe. Overall, its a well produced, well directed drama, with an excellent ending unlike the typical WWII Jewish conscintration camp fare from the Austro-German film school.",1365120000,7,2740,5.143497757847534

4519326,4,B00512YMJ2,"""Mein bester Feind"" (""My Best Enemy"") is an Austrian film starring Moritz Bleibtreu (""Run Lola Run"" ""The Baader Meinhof Complex"") as a son of a renowned Jewish art gallery owner living in Vienna when Hitler is about to annex Austria. In this suspense drama Victor has to survive the dark times of the Holocaust, using two things very cleverly: his brain and a secret about a Michelangelo drawing that the Nazi officers are desperately after.

Set in 1938 Vienna, the film's story centers on Victor Kaufmann, son of a wealthy Jewish family, and Rudi Smekal (Georg Friedrich), his best friend and son of the mother who worked for the Kaufmanns as a housemaid for 25 years. One day Victor shows Rudi something very precious - a drawing of Michelangelo that Victor's father Jakob (Udo Samel) possesses in a secret room of the house. Soon Victor realizes his mistake, however, when days later Nazi SS officers arrive to confiscate the drawing. But Victor's father, who knew this could happen, had already made a plan - a plan that would have far-reaching effects on the lives of Victor and Rudi.

On the IMDb site ""My Best Enemy"" is categorized as ""comedy"" and/or ""drama."" But don't expect something like Ernst Lubitsch or Charles Chaplin classics. Perhaps ""satire"" would be a more appropriate word to describe the nature of the film's humor, even though it is not as biting as it should be. The story is full of twists and turns (and some incredible coincidences) until the satisfying ending - satisfying, I mean, if you totally forget the historical background against which the story is told. The film's overall tone is lighter than what you would expect from the subject matter involved, thanks to the narrative that is fast-paced and well-balanced.

Produced by Josef Aichholzer, who also made Oscar-winning ""The Counterfeiters,"" ""My Best enemy"" is certainly a unique take on Holocaust-themed movies. But whether or not you like the film (which makes its point with the fate of ""my best enemy"") will depend on you.",1330732800,17,2014,4.900293255131965
4519327,5,B00512YMJ2,"Irony, wry laughter and great twists in this suspense drama will keep you on the edge of your seat.
Against the backdrop of the Holocaust, two former friends ( an Aryan and a Jew ), seek to outwit each other in a desperate bid for survival.
It also provides a frightening examination of, once again, how someone can be so corrupted as to participate in the destruction of fellow human beings that were once beloved friends.",1421020800,,423,4.578947368421052

4519333,5,B00512YMJ2,"I confess that the reviews here aroused my curiosity. Many reviewers described it as a dark comedy, and after viewing it, all I can say is that rarely has a film depicting WW II and the Holocaust (although this really isn't the movie's focus), been so entertaining in a funny and witty way (Life is Beautiful is another that comes to mind). I wasn't sure what to expect but I am glad I watched it. The film is masterfully put together, is well-paced throughout, and contains some truly nail-biting suspenseful moments.

Victor Kaufman (Moritz Bleibtreu) is the only son and heir of successful Jewish parents who own a gallery in Vienna, Austria. Victor is an upper class Jew but quite down-to-earth and one of his closest friends is his childhood friend Rudi, the son of the Kaufman's maid. Rudi (Georg Friedrich) has been away in Germany for a bit, but is eager to get re-acquainted with his childhood pal. When the Kaufmans' throw a party at the gallery, Rudi shows up with a friend, and gets reacquainted with Lena (Ursula Strauss), a girl both Victor and Rudi love.

To cut a long story short - Rudi basically wants all that Victor has, and when Rudi discovers the Kaufmans possess a rare sketch by Michelangelo, a work of art that the Fuhrer himself wants so that he can present it to Il Duce, i.e. Benito Mussolini, to cement the alliance between Nazi Germany and Italy, the stage is set for betrayal of the worst kind, and that takes both Victor and Rudi on a pulse-pounding game of cat and mouse, involving deceit, mistaken identities, romance, and more.

To say more would be to spoil it for viewers, and let's just say that this is truly an entertaining film that has its dark moments, but is better appreciated as an engaging and witty film with some truly funny scenes. It merits repeated viewings too!",1390435200,9,1814,4.627329192546584
4519334,5,B00512YMJ2,"I first saw this film at a festival several years ago. I arrived late and had to sit on the side where I couldn't see the subtitles. I enjoyed what I saw and vowed to see it again when it became available on TV.  The second time around was a wholly satisfying experience and well worth the wait.
This suspense story tells the story of a Jewish family of art dealers in 1938 Austria.  They obtain a rare Michelangelo drawing and the Nazis want it.  Their former housekeeper's son who's been raised in their house as one of the family becomes a Nazi and conspires with them to get the picture.  The story is filled with twists and turns that kept me involved right to the end.",1387670400,3,674,4.283464566929134

8452229,3,B00512YMJ2,"Three stars is generous. The movie basically follows Hollywood style fantasy fodder with little historical worth. The story is ludicrous, the historical details are ho hum.
Most of the supporting characters fall into two cookie cutter categories: good guy helper and bad guy German. The characters who have anything approaching a developed personality are the main characters. The plot drags on and on until you stop caring about this made for TV historical fantasy drama.

If you have any serious interest in WW2 history, don't waste your time. If you just want to turn your brian off and be entertained, no need to spend this money and catch it on Netflix.",1439769600,,658,4.927927927927928
