2412474,5,B000BC8SYC,"Gilbert Gottfried is a genius.  THANK YOU for making a DVD that puts so many dirty jokes where they long--together!  Of course I knew a few, but I learned so many more!  Gilbert's delivery is priceless, and his impressions of comics like Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld make some of the jokes even funnier.

If you're a fan of filthy humor, this DVD is a MUST HAVE!  My personal favorite is about the guy who doesn't know if his wife has VD or TB...

And at $13.99...it's a steal.  DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!",1138233600,4,501,4.26595744680851
2412475,5,B000BC8SYC,"I am so glad I bought this dvd! Gilbert's jokes, delivery, timing and seemingly stream of consciousness styled mental excursions are brilliant, but I think my fave is the ""extras"". Unique and refreshing even if some of the jokes are ""classics"".",1138147200,2,244,4.975609756097561
2412476,5,B000BC8SYC,"Like him or not, Gilbert Gottfried is one of the most interesting and unorthodox comics working today.  Of course the jokes are old, and many are familiar to most of us, which is the obvious gimmick of the show (ergo the title).  If you know and like Gottfried, then you know that it's not the moldy joke but the way it is delivered that matters, and Gottfried has a mostly masterful method.  When a joke fails (and the audience is pretty bland here), Gottfried's ability to retrieve the moment often results in a far funnier and bizarre running commentary and/or audience critique, which has always been his strongest point (there are occasional and unfortunate end-of-joke cuts which disrupt the rhythm, but they aren't overly disruptive).
If there were other records of his stand-up currently available on the market, then I would lessen my rating to four stars, since his original work is generally more rewarding.  Since it is all that is presently out there, it gets five.  Unlike the pandering observational humor of Jerry Seinfeld or the family-friendly musings of Bill Cosby (both of whom get mocked fairly mercilessly here), ""Dirty Jokes"" is not for all tastes...thank God!",1137715200,12,1183,4.954545454545454
2412477,2,B000BC8SYC,"I loved Gilbert Gottfried in ""The Aristocrats"", and have enjoyed him on radio.  Here, he is basically the Henny Youngman of dirty jokes.  Every joke is old and at least one I heard 25 years ago on a Bette Midler album.  The jokes where I couldn't hit the punchline before Gilbert did, my wife could.

The ""extras"" -- clips of Gottfried where he apparently turned a home video camera on himself, rambled for a few days and then edited -- are just terrible.  He does a great Bela Lugosi impression and he's the first person I've ever seen do Alan King.  All his other impressions suck.

It was also a great price so I bought it. I laughed all the way thru it. I highly recommend giving this a view. You won't be disappointed. He tells the jokes very well and the crowd loves it.

The bit about the Hugh Heffner Roast is brilliant and makes no sense. If you are easily offended, this may not be for you. The humor is crude and politically incorrect. If you enjoy Gilbert, buy it.

I got a LOT of laughs out of this DVD, and believe it or not there are a handful of jokes in there that are suitable for mixed company (as long as they're not too uptight).

I thought his retelling of ""the Aristocrats"" was plain shabby, though, compared to what we saw in the movie of that name.",1286668800,,508,4.326315789473684
2412533,2,B000BC8SYC,"Gilbert Gottfried: Dirty Jokes: 4 out of 10: Notice the 'concert film' is called Dirty Jokes not funny jokes. I also put concert film in quotes because this is the most disinterested collection of Yuppies I have ever seen. The audience often groans or at the very least sits in an impatient silence during Gottfried's performance.

Not that Gottfried does not give them reason to squirm. His jokes are dirty... that was a given, but quite often they simply are not all that funny. Part of the problem is many of these moldy chestnuts are probably older than Gottfried himself. It is as if he was giving an X-rated Jack Benny routine.

The culmination of this collection of tasteless one-liners is yet another rendition of the Aristocrats joke. If you missed that dead horse-beating documentary The Aristocrats, the joke is a ten-minute collection of the most scatological collection of images followed by a shaggy joke punch line. The joke (like most shaggy dog humor) only works if you are not expecting it. Here it falls horribly flat with an audience that is clearly bored.

If you want to see the funniest version of the joke fast forward towards the end the The Aristocrats and their is a hilarious (and historical) version told in front of a squirming Hugh Hefner a few weeks after 9/11. The brilliant comedian who pulled of this unlikely triumph?... Gilbert Gottfried.",1258329600,,1375,4.842553191489362

2412535,5,B000BC8SYC,"How funny can a guy telling 45 dirty be? The answer is very funny. Gilbert truly has the delivery of these down pat, and the material is top notch. It is often said that telling jokes on stage is comedy suicide... Gilbert breathes new life into the profession with this DVD however.

The Bonus material is priceless. I've seen few people who can improv on a topic like Gilbert can, he goes on and on and on with side splitting material.",1212364800,,436,4.382716049382716

I do remember a small bit he did years ago about Moby Dick that I thought was hilarious but, that was about it. In this newer stand-up Gilbert takes a lot of old stale jokes and turns them into new fresh and often side splittingly funny routines. I was doubled over with laughter many times during this 48 minute set. This set is extremely dirty and we hear some of our favorite curse words frequently so, if the C or F word bothers you,........don't watch this! If they don't, then grab a beer and some friends and get ready to laugh your A** off! I rate it 4 1/2 stars",1202601600,13,650,4.166666666666667

2412553,3,B000BC8SYC,"Gilbert Gottfried has a reputation for being a ""comedian's comedian"" -- he is that and more.  He's at his best when he's unscripted (or appears so) and the ""extra"" material on the DVD does very well by him.

Unfortunately, this DVD is probably not the best choice for an introduction.

If you are familiar with his work (and you like it), then you'll enjoy the DVD.  In the main feature of the DVD he is telling old, non-original dirty jokes before a packed house at Caroline's.  It's a small (but venerable) stage and magnifies the idiosyncracries of a performer so be prepared.  After getting over the initial shock of seeing him in makeup and hair colour, it was nice to see him in his element -- and his impressions of Bill Cosby, Alan King, and Jerry Seinfeld make me smile and take my mind off the punchlines I already know.  As I watched the main DVD feature I really wanted him to ditch the material and go off on one of his extemporaneous sidebars (and he almost does a few times) -- that is why I like him so much and why he's known as a comedian's comedian.

For me, the price of the DVD was met with the extra material.  This is where we get a glimpse of the true Gilbert Gottfried.  Anyone who sees comedy on the Internet has probably seen his legendary appearance at the Hugh Hefner roast.  It's a hysterical bit and shows Gilbert at his best.  On the DVD extra material, we find a selection that leads us to believe we're going to see that bit, but instead we're treated to a lengthy (and funny) explanation as to why we will NOT see it.  Don't be disappointed, you can poke around on the Internet and see it for free anyway.

By the way, when you see Gilbert staring at you on the DVD, does anyone else notice a disturbing resemblance to Humphrey Bogart?",1141689600,4,1770,4.3567073170731705
2412554,5,B000BC8SYC,"Gilbert,

Jesus, your DVD is funny.  I went all the way and paid the extra dough for the autographed version.  That donut bit with both Kennedys, Martin Luther King Jr. and Charles Lindbergh (shortly after his son was found dead) was killing me.  My god...

By the way, I forgot to mention that a friend and I saw The Aristocrats at the Crest Theater in Sacramento the night it came out.  You've heard this from everybody I'm sure, but you and Saget put that film over the top.  Bob...because other than comedians, nobody knows he is one of the filthiest comics out there.  But I swear to you, I was crying by the time your bit was over.  Especially the footage of the roast.  Jesus.  I don't know if you were in on the editing of that movie but you ougtta thank Penn big time because that film showed everybody that other comedians love your stuff.  It was kind of like the film culminated with your gig.  That's gotta be a huge ego boost if nothing else.

Thanks for making me laugh like hell.

A big fan,

Joseph Dutra

p.s. I love your appearances on Howard.  I heard you last week and it reminded me to go to your website and order the DVD. I'm begging you to do more obscure references when you're on.",1141603200,16,1207,4.288888888888889
2412555,3,B000BC8SYC,"This DVD contains a fairly short live performance in which Gilbert is literally just telling dirty jokes (as opposed to doing his standup act).  At least some of the jokes are very old ones.  One in particular I remember reading in a book called Truly Tasteless Jokes as a child in the 80's--it's a really stupid one about two men in a hot tub.  But there were at least two that made me laugh really hard.

There are a lot of extras on this DVD, and all of them involve Gilbert on a sofa talking to a camera.  He's doing comedy here, but most of it does not work that well.  In terms of amount of comedy as measured by time, there is no shortage on this DVD if you include all the extras.  The quality of most of it, especially the extra features, is what the problem is.

If you are not a fan of Gilbert, I'd personally prefer that you skip this DVD.  This will likely give you a bad first impression and will turn you off to him forever, and that would be sad because he really is a really funny person.  The place to catch Gilbert really is on his frequent appearances on the Howard Stern show on Sirius radio.

If you are a fan of Gilbert, you'll get a couple of big laughs out of this, and to me, that makes it worth the price, especially if you get it as a gift like I did.

GREETINGS FROM GILBERT is superior to this one.  GREETINGS FROM GILBERT is a pretty old one that contains Gilbert's stand-up act, and it's pretty funny.  It's out of print, and only on VHS, but it's worth it to try to hunt down a copy of it.",1141171200,3,1522,4.08080808080808
