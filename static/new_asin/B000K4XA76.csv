8520290,5,B000K4XA76,"Every thing you would want to know as a beginner is included by a very well
organized and articulate drummer.  I appreciated his emphasis on technique,  how to practice
effectively and ultimately how to create great sounding music.  And experienced drummers can use this dvd for review.

As a professional musician (harp) I use the same approach when teaching and giving workshops, because I know it to be a solid method.

The lessons and knowledge gained from this dvd is cost effective as compared to paying for lessons.  I would suggest having this dvd in conjunction with taking lessons, but this way you can refer to the dvd as often as you wish.

I then purchased the Fun-To-Know tuning and maintenance dvd by the same drummer.

I have purchased dvd's for instruction purpose in the past, and have not always found them as helpful as I had wished because o as I can not always follow along fast enough, or learn in  reverse, etc., but with this dvd you will learn and have fun!  So pick up your sticks and start drumming!",1393804800,,1027,4.593406593406593
