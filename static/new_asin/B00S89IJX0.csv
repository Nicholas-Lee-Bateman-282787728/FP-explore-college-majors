6964038,2,B00S89IJX0,"NOTE: This review is not designed for hardcore fans of the show. Such fans will always exist and do not necessarily have a terribly objective view of the show. This review is for people who don't know the show and would like one of many perspectives. I have nothing personal against the show's producers and actors, just an assessment about the quality of the writing and acting.

The idea that ""The Brady Bunch"" portrayed a ""realistic"" suburban family has its roots in TV fantasy-land, similar to the silliness of ""Happy Days"" and ""Leave It to Beaver"". Most of the situations in this show were ridiculous contrivances that had little basis in reality whatsoever. The seed of the show was conceived from a newspaper article stating that something like 40% of families had children from other marriages. I guess if you can take a statistic and make it into a TV show, you can do anything. You can also throw spaghetti against the wall and hope it sticks.

The shortcoming of the entire show was that the writer-producers did not seem to base any of the episodes upon real-life incidences, which is where the real human drama resides, and where some of the funniest material comes from. I have always believed the best story material can't be made up; it comes from seeing real people doing ridiculous things you could never imagine. That's why shows like the Dick Van Dyke Show are so well-written and ultimately hilarious because it was based on the writers' experiences. Even the Partridge Family was based on a real-life singing family. Not the Brady Bunch whose scripts were strictly drummed out of thin air, which is always the least effective way to write if the intention is to be ""realistic"".

The contrived situations seemed at odds with the issues with which young people were facing in the late 1960's and early 1970's. For a time resplendent with social issues and social change, the Brady Bunch relied on the banal. (In fact, the father of the show played by Robert Reed was an in-closet gay man. Wouldn't that have made the show interesting?) But no, the Brady's situations were mainly trivial. Playing ball in the house. Bobby is falsely accused of doll-napping. Cindy makes it a habit to tattle-tale. Rather silly stuff. They never dealt with death, prejudice, love, hate, race relations, or politics.

I was slightly younger than the Brady Bunch kids (I grew up in the SF Bay Area suburbs in the 1970's and 1980's), and yet I never knew anyone who had the kinds of ""situations"" that the Brady's did. I'll confess that I did watch the show in reruns, but there were a lot of episodes that, even as a kid, I thought were rather stupid. One of the kids having an ""identity crisis"" was a recurring theme throughout the show. I never knew anyone, among my family or my friends, who engaged in this kind of behavior. In one episode, Peter Brady adopts the personality of Humphrey Bogart. In another Jan Brady wears a wig. In yet another, Bobby tries to make himself tall by hanging from a swing set. Or when Marcia becomes stuck on herself as a ""star"".

Maybe one of the few episodes that had a spark of realism was when Jan was jealous over Marcia's success at school. Of course, Marcia wins every award you could imagine. And when Marcia enters an essay contest in which she describes her relationship with her father, of course she wins first prize. It would have been far more interesting and real if she hadn't won but still felt the same way about her father. The fact that she wins somehow loses any modicum of interest the episode might of had. But of course, this is American television, 1970's style. She HAS to win.

Probably the stand-out of the show was Eve Aline Plumb as Jan. Despite a lot of the mediocre writing, Plumb brought a sensibility to her character that was lacking in a lot of the rest of the cast, including the parents, who were probably the least-interesting of the whole family. The parents, Mike and Carol seemed like know-it-all busy bodies who were near-perfect but lacked any real emotions, not to mention any shortcomings. I would have like to have seen a little more blood-feuding between them. That's what happens in real families. But again, not the Brady Bunch. Even the cook-housekeeper Alice was a bit more interesting than the parents.

Overall, a mediocre show at best and a contrived somewhat intelligence-insulting program at worst. I think the Brady Bunch tells us more about perceived sensibilities and prescriptive norms of Americans in the 1970's than being a realistic portrayal of the 1970's, much the same as ""Leave It to Beaver"" in the late 1950's to early 1960's. And maybe that's the problem. The Brady Bunch never showed what it was really like but instead tried to show us what we were supposed to be like.",1433030400,6,4774,4.70334928229665
6964039,5,B00S89IJX0,This is a funny show and a good show which is one of the first shows I remember watching  as a kid although unfortunally not for long. They soon took it out of syndication until I was a teenager.  Its a good show as I said with Mike Carol Alice and of course Greg Marcia Peter Jan Bobby and Cindy and all the stuff they went through. You should get this. Youll be sorry if you dont.,1429660800,9,382,3.948051948051948
6964040,4,B00S89IJX0,"The Brady Bunch was one of the very last squeaky-clean family sitcoms in the old '50s mold, airing as an anachronism of sorts during the Vietnam War years amid the chaos of Civil Rights, women's rights, and anti-war protests. But in the Brady household, father Mike, a working architect, was still king of the castle with a den all his own, while his wife, Carol, was a stay-at-home mom who had the luxury of a servant. The children got into all sorts of minor conflicts and mischief, but none of the storylines tackled serious parental concerns of the day. Everything was sibling rivalry and innocent mix-ups. There were conflicts over clubhouses, shared things and spaces, class elections, invented boyfriends, broken things that had to be replaced, and even talent shows. Drugs? Not here. Peer pressure to smoke? Only briefly. Teen pregnancy? Please! While other teens from the time were raiding their parents' liquor cabinets, this group was content to raid the cookie jar. No one got into really serious trouble, and there was usually a lesson to be learned . . . from dad. When he wasn't around, there was always mom or Alice, the housekeeper/cook (Ann B. Davis), to help them find their way.

First telecast on Sept 26, 1969, the show was a surprise hit, no doubt because it felt like comfort food to Americans who snuggled together during a turbulent era to watch and relive happier, more uncomplicated times. Divorce was becoming a widespread phenomenon for the first time, and the show about second-chance family life probably struck a chord with broken families. The range of the Brady children's ages (7 through 14, when the show began) was broad enough for most youngsters to identify with. Airing on Friday nights, the show connected especially with children too young to have a social life, or, like the Bradys, too awkward and introverted. The Brady Bunch never finished in the Nielsen Top-30 and never won any Emmys, yet the show has become a cultural icon, lampooned in two feature films and held up as an example of one of the last wholesome family sitcoms to be telecast . . . before TV sitcom families would start spouting one-liners and zapping each other with zingers, before families (or rather, writers) got ""hip.""

Robert Reed starred as Everyfather Mike Brady, with singer Florence Henderson finding the right pitch as Carol Brady. They clicked as a couple and were believable as former single parents of three (he, three boys, and she, three girls) who married and combined their broods. People who study birth order behavior will be hard-pressed to find anything askew here. The oldestGreg (Barry Williams) and Marcia (Maureen McCormick)often take the center stage, as siblings are apt to do in real life. The youngestBobby (Mike Lookinland) and Cindy (Susan Olsen)struggle to shed the ""baby"" image. The middle children, meanwhilePeter (Christopher Knight) and Jan (Eve Plumb)have to work overtime to create a niche for themselves. Maybe thats why, as corny as the shows were and as naively clean-cut as the Bradys seemed during the show's five-year run, audiences kept coming back for moreeven when the show went to daytime syndication.

It should come as no surprise that Sherwood Schwartz, the man who brought viewers Gilligan's Island, was responsible for this tale of a blended family stranded together under a single, sometimes straining-at-the-seams roof. That's because their antics can seem just as corny as Gilligan and the Skipper's. Is it dated? Certainly. But now thats part of the fun, part of what makes it an entertaining show. The Bradys were a lovable bunch, poised somewhere between those cherubs whose cheeks you want to pinch and the goody-two-shoes so out of touch with the way normal people behave that you want to laugh at them . . . or shake them. Of course, that's what director Betty Thomas did in The Brady Bunch Movie (1995), which poked enormous fun at this blended California family from the Seventies who acted like it was the Fifties. When they uttered a word like ""groovy,"" it never sounded so interplanetary.

Still, this is one wholesome, classic American TV series that remains perfect for family viewing, with plenty of warmth and laughs . . . some of them intentional. A word on the space-saving packaging: With this set, which is housed in a newly designed hard plastic case with single discs on single-page clips to keep them from getting scratched (see my webpage for photo), you really only save the width of one standard DVD case. So if you already have Seasons 1-5 with the individual hologram covers, theres no need to upgrade, if thats your only motivation.

6964041,5,B00S89IJX0,"THE BRADY BUNCH ran on ABC-TV from 1969 to 1974. It is one of the most well-remembered shows of the early 70s, its popularity having grown with the years. One of the last traditional house-bound comedies, it dealt with the adventures of the parents and children of a blended family  a widower (Robert Reed) with three sons and a widow (Florence Henderson) with three daughters. On hand to provide funny wisecracks was housekeeper Alice (Ann B. Davis).  Though the series wasn't a notable critical or ratings success during its initial run, it became enormously popular in syndication.

The idea for THE BRADY BUNCH started back in 1966 when Sherwood Schwartz learned that between 20 to 30 % of all families had at least one child from a previous marriage. He wrote a 30-minute pilot episode and shopped it around to the three networks at the time: ABC, CBS, and NBC. Because the networks wanted to make significant changes to Schwartz concept, he backed off. In 1968, the movie Yours, Mine and Ours came out. It starred Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball as parents of children from previous marriages who wed and have a baby of their own. At this point, ABC picked up the show for broadcast.

Memorable episodes include The Slumber Caper, in which Marcia and the girls throw a slumber party and Greg (Barry Williams) and the boys crash it; Amateur Night, featuring a transformation of the Brady kids into the Silver Platters for a TV talent competition; Adios, Johnny Bravo, the Season 5 opener in which Greg is signed by a talent agent to become a rock star named Johnny Bravo, a role that inflates his ego; Will the Real Jan Brady Please Stand Up, where Jan (Eve Plumb), tired of being the middle nearly anonymous girl of the family, altering herself a makeover by buying a black wig; and Our Son the Man, chronicling Greg starting high school, complete with love beads and a fringe vest.

Though many might find the plots corny, they reflect the last efforts of TV networks to present typical family comedy. Soon after, shows such as All in the Family, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Sanford and Son would usher in a whole new era in comedy television.

For fans of THE BRADY BUNCH, this is a must-have set. This hefty collection contains all 117 episodes of the network run on 20 discs. The discs are packaged in a sturdy plastic case and come with an outer cardboard sleeve designed to look like denim.",1428624000,16,2402,4.653301886792453
6964042,4,B00S89IJX0,"While I like the packaging on this set (it is more convenient to stick on a shelf with other box sets than the shag carpet set that is already out), it is missing extras. If you notice, this is a 20-disc set, while the shag carpet version is 21-discs.

So what you DON'T get with this set (but do get in the shag carpet set):
A Very Brady Christmas (TV Movie)
The Brady 500 - Pilot Telefilm (The first two episodes of the 6-episode 'The Bradys' were edited together and aired later as this movie)
The Brady Kids -  two episodes from the 1972 animated show

BTW yes I'm reviewing this before it is out, but it's just the first 20 discs from a set that IS out. So aside from the quality of the box, I know what to expect.",1422489600,124,719,4.085106382978723
6964043,2,B00S89IJX0,"I have the shag version and it's fine. It seems very silly to me for Paramount to release what I'm guessing is just a case of different packaging, even though those on the bad side of the shag version will find some solace. I just hate to see them release the same ol' thing all over again for the third time (first the single seasons, then the shag, and now this). I'm waiting for them to do a restore of the dvd versions, as quite a bit of the original version video (the restored majority is from the syndicated cut versions) is quite bad indeed. IOW, I would like to see the cut portions restored as well, and/or a Blu-ray version.

If this is one of those spindle jobs, this is really a waste of time, because for those who bought the shag and it had glue issues, I'm not sure many of them would want to buy spindle packaging. As well, if it is spindled, you would think the price would be a lot cheaper (so maybe it isn't spindled?). Unlike un-spindled versions of most any dvd set, this one doesn't show any individual season boxes within, which very strongly suggests a spindle.

BTW, this is probably too tacky for a lot of people, but if you buy a spindle set, besides the obvious of putting them in individual dvd boxes or sleeves, you can put them all in sleeves and punch holes in the sleeves so that they can still be within the spindled box, however, as I haven't tried that on any spindle set I have, I can't guarantee that a large amount of paper sleeves wouldn't make the entire stack so large that there wouldn't be room for all of them. It does at least address the issue some people have that the disks will scratch if they're stacked as common spindles do with nothing between them. Hmm, some day somebody will make spindles with at least a paper divider between them. It would really be neat in The Brady Bunch case, if you could have paper flowers such as seen on this cover of this set, to separate them, but better is possible of course. For the more creative of us out there, they could make these themselves. Ha Ha, you could make one of Marcia and punch a hole where her nose would be.",1422489600,5,2114,4.2825
6964044,5,B00S89IJX0,"Very happy for a rerelease of this set - already preordered.  I viewed the content before (same as then""shag carpeting"" release) but never purchased it because I just didn't like the packaging.  This is a great alternative.",1422057600,4,223,5.0
6964045,5,B00S89IJX0,"I'm glad they're issuing this series in a new non-shag carpet set.  I'm glad I held off buying that ugly previous set that had glue issues.
Plus, yes, I'm giving this a 5-star to offset the other whiny reviewers who are giving this a one star when it doesn't rightly reflect on the quality of this series set itself.",1421971200,9,316,4.3559322033898304
6964046,1,B00S89IJX0,The only way I will invest my hard earned money on the entire series of the Brady bunch is if it was released in HD or Bluray. Then I would eagerly plop my money down.,1421971200,6,167,3.8

6964050,5,B00S89IJX0,"This wasn't exactly my favorite show back in the day, it was just ""something to watch"", and...O-K, I had a huge crush on JAN when I was a kid [Am I the only one who thought Jan was the hottie? Never did care care for Marcia at all!]- but over the years, I'd often think of this show, not just as being something very wholesome, but as sort of a reminder of the glorious 70's in which I grew up.

I really didn't know if the show would be watchable to me, a 56 year old heterosexual male, now- but when I saw this set for less than thirty clams, I figured I'd give it a try, and I am sure glad that I did, because let me tell you, this show STILL holds up! I seem to enjoy it more now than I did when I was a kid!

Ah! A show that was made when TV networks still cared about not offending the moral values of the mainstream! A show which exudes the seventies, but which is not cheesy or corny or cliched, but instead is a slice of life from the time period in which it was made! Watching these episodes brings glorious memories flooding back! And I even find myself getting some laughs from it!

Who'd have thunk it? The Brady Bunch? The BRADY BUNCH! And I'm enjoying it more than ever. (O-K, I'm not going to rush out and tell ""the guys""....but I am relieved to be able to confess it here! :D)

I find it interesting too, to observe my reactions to the show now vs. then. In some ways my opinions are the same (Cindy is still annoying as hell!)....and in some ways they are different (I now have an affinity for Bobby, and can detect a quality of depth in him- whereas I used to consider him as annoying as Cindy).

I'm marathoning these eps, and having a BALL! It just makes me feel so good! (Pssst! Don't tell my friends and business acquaintances. I have an image to maintain!)

Oh, and if you're buying this series, I guarantee that you would enjoy reading Barry Williams's book:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Growing-Up-Brady-I-Was-a-Teenage-Greg-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0967378508/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Growing Up Brady: I Was a Teenage Greg, Special Collector's Edition</a>&nbsp;-I read it 20 years ago- and still remember it, and how much fun I had reading it!

And, oh, yeah....about the DVD set: It comes in a nice plastic case- not the flimsy cheesy cardboard you'd expect of such an inexpensive set. The discs are rather hard to pry off of the hubs, making it feel like I am going to crack them when popping them out.....but hey, ya can't have everything for this price, eh? Oh...and the picture quality and audio and everything are fine!

All in all: WELL DONE! I bought this just on a lark- for nostalgia really, but it has surprised me as being one of my best DVD purchases in quite some time.

UPDATE: The above comments are in reference to seasons 1-4. The show falls apart in season 5- from the very fist episode of the season! I mean, there's Johnny Bravo; numerous eps where they're in plays; talent show; even ballet(!); a terrible ep which was no doubt a spin-off attempt at some primitive multicultural propaganda.....and something i had completely forgotten about: The dreaded COUSIN OLIVER!!!

It's actually kind of funny to watch season 5 though- not that the show is funny, but rather it is like viewing a stereotypical textbook scenario of producers who have run out of ideas/enthusiasm (or just stopped giving a darn) trying everything in the book to maintain a dead show through one more season. Season 5 is a veritable what-not-to-do for anyone embarking on a career in TV production!

No wonder I'd never seen many of these season 5 eps in syndication when i was young....who in their right mind would want to recycle episodes which surely bombed when they initially aired?!",1523232000,6,3763,4.660633484162896

The plastic flip set that the discs are on is loose in the case and slides around. Several of the discs were loose, and some of them scratched. One disc wouldn't play due to the damage from visible scratches. The ones that weren't loose were very hard to take out. I exchanged for a new set, and the new one was the same way.
