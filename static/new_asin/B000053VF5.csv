The acting was good, the plot was on point and the mystery was excellent!

I highly recommend this movie to pre teens and teens in general.
Perfect family film, and it's one of my favorites from my childhood.
It came on ""The Wonderful World Of Disney"" when i was 9 or 10.

Anyway, great movie! I'm proud to have it with my Disney film collection.

Too bad it's not on DVD though. Oh well, i still have a VCR! LOL",1310860800,,443,4.188235294117647
7930751,2,B000053VF5,I only gave this 2 stars because I was incorrect in my thinking this was the original series.  I bought it for my husband and he wasn't impressed with it.  Had I looked closer at the description I would have realized it was a newer version of the old series.  Just thought I'd write this review in case someone else was as quick to purchase.,1287532800,4,341,4.2153846153846155
7930752,5,B000053VF5,"This movie was great! For my parents, It was a treat to see characters they grew up watching on T.V. in an all new adventure. For me and my brother, It was something new. Marty's parents are ready to send him to a dude ranch (Triple R) because he spends all day reading and has no friends. So they comprimise. If Marty can make a friend in 3 days, he dosen't have to go to the dude ranch. So he tries to buddy up with Spin, a boy who lives in the same appartment building. Spin is into crime solving and always getting into trouble. But soon, Spin and Marty discover that their new nabor is up to no good. It turns into a huge adventure. And for those who like the old series on the triple r ranch, they do go there in the end. As soon as the price hits around 13 dollars, buy it!",984182400,12,780,3.9745222929936306
