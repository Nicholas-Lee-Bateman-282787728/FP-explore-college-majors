6242373,5,B00HX6FD6K,"A live performance from Bach's best known home base, in beautiful HD video and subtle surround sound - no gimmicks, just a natural enveloping reverberation. Having first found out about it from a colleague who was present in the audience (July 2013 Leipzig Bach Festival), I first viewed it on the internet, and when this disk came out I just knew it would be a stunner.",1398902400,6,370,4.621212121212121
6242374,5,B00HX6FD6K,"There are several performances of this monumental work available on DVD. Essentially, they fall into two categories- the ""Catholic""
approach- a grander scale, in number of instruments, venue and interpretation that is aimed to impress the audience. Carl Richter and Enoch zu Guttenberg fall into this 'South-German category. The second, and more attractive to me, is the Protestant approach-
smaller number of players, less stellar, but nevertheless solid, soloists, period instruments, smaller, more intimate venues, and above all- a more contemplative interpretation that imparts to the listeners the inner strength of the music. In short- quality over quantity. For Christoph Biller, the current St. Thomas cantor, this is his second DVD of Bach's B-Mass, and a study in his evolved approach to performing Bach's music. As expected, St. Thomas's Children Boys' Choir anchors the performance, but whereas the musicians in the first version are, as in many other, or almost all, performances players from the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, in this performance (recorded during the 2013 Bach festspielle) the musicians are members of the incomparable Freiburg Barock
Orchestre. The harmonious integration of instruments, choir and soloists is to my taste unsurpassed. Particularly satisfying are the wind instruments. The 3 trumpeters are superb- their sound his bright but not glistening. The solo (natural) horn, is the best yet I heard, on LPs, CDs, DVDs, or live. The stings are warm and wonderful. Of course the St. Thomas venue adds to the grandeur of the performance. I heard parts of the Mass live at St. Thomas several years back. This one is so much better. Biller unquestionably has matured in his understanding how to perform this magnificent work. It should be in the library of each and every Bach aficionado.",1397347200,15,1822,5.351916376306621
8637055,5,B00HX6FD6K,"This is a performance by the St. Thomas Boys Choir of Leipzig of the Mass in B Minor conducted by Georg Christoph Biller.  The performances by the Choir, the Soloists and orchestra are magnificent!",1472947200,,197,4.794117647058823
8637056,5,B00HX6FD6K,"A really, really superlative performance of the b minor mass. It has become one of my favorites (and I have 50+ different recordings of this mass). An all male choir that sings beautifully and in tune. Period instrumentals. Very good soloists, perhaps not the very best (some insights are missing), but they sing flawlessly. And above all, a conductor who knows what he does!",1472083200,,375,4.875
8637057,2,B00HX6FD6K,"I was not at all happy with the production, technically or artistically.  The miking was so poor you could barely hear the soloing instruments.  I sent it back and bought the one with Herbert Blomstedt conducting.  It's perfect all around and the piece shines like it deserves to.",1444435200,,280,4.791666666666667

8637060,5,B00HX6FD6K,"Bach,s supreme testament performed at St. Thomas church by the Thomanchoir and Freiburg players  performing the B Minor Mass with choir and an orchestra  of instruments that Bach would have surely worked with. during his tenure in Leipzig.. The performance is a gripping example of love and devotion to Bach,s masterpiece; A performance to be cherished.",1427328000,,353,5.285714285714286
8637061,5,B00HX6FD6K,"The finest recording and finest video of one of humanities great achievements, the J.S. Bach b min Mass. Professor Biller understands sacred performance like no other. This is J.S. Bach's masterpiece performed as he would have loved to have performed it. Thomanerchor is the finest choir of its kind. Thank you Professor Biller.",1425168000,,328,5.2075471698113205

8637063,5,B00HX6FD6K,"This was everything I expected and more! The Thomanerchor  does the music great justice, and shows the kind of training and dedication that Herr Biller and the young gentlemen exhibit in every recording I've heard. In addition, one could not ask for a better orchestra. Those good folks know what they're doing, and together, make the whole listening experience most enjoyable. The sound is clean, camera work is excellent, To watch the music making is awesome.....I wish every boy I know could have this experience...... Buy this.....you won't be disappointed!",1420243200,,561,5.233333333333333
8637064,5,B00HX6FD6K,"This is a very beautiful authentic performance of one of JS Bach's greatest choral works with an original instrument orchestra with the St Thomas Boys choir and the church where he was cantor (musical director) as he would have heard his music.  The video and sound were excellent and featured all the performers along with beautiful views of the church.  Herr Biller is Bach's successor and immersed in and devoted to the music as well as a great educator.  He brings out a sustained and excellent performance from his students in a very lengthy performance which must have been exhausting for all.  It was great that all performers were acknowledged with the audience at the end.  The only difference from the earlier authentic performances by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt some 30 years ago now is that the soprano and alto solos are sung by adult females who are both very fine here along with the tenor and bass solos.  It is difficult to find boys up to the solo parts but it would be great if such talent might be found in the future.  This performance was very comparable and a fine complement to the St Matthew's Passion done a year earlier.  I along with many others do hope that they will now do the St John's Passion and possibly a DVD of 3 or 4 of the great cantatas, BWV147 and the Magnificat for example.",1400630400,6,1331,4.586497890295359
