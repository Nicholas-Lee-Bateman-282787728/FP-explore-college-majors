1805676,5,B00007BK2S,"The BET movie Prison Song was one of the best movies I've ever seen before.  I was wondering, why wasn't the movies put into theatres all across the world, this movie was a huge hit for Bet.  This question is for anyone out there who may know the answer, exactly how can I get the soundtrack to Prison Song.  I know it's on Tommy Boy records but thats all I know.  If someone has any information please contact me via e-mail, Chung220@aol.com.  Thanks",1073952000,4,451,4.385542168674699
1805677,4,B00007BK2S,"Q-tip, Fat Joe, and Mary J Blige give good performances, especially Q-tip. His character has it all going on in the inside and is very quiet on the outside but I still got completely absorbed in what he was going through. The musical sequences blend well too. Just when you're about to punch a wall because of what's happening to the characters, somebody lets loose with a song that expresses the emotions that the movie is bringing up. Mary J. Blige is the queen of from-the-heart songs, and Fat Joe has a rap cameo that slides seamlessly into the scene.
Aside from the individual elements, the movie takes aim at one of the worst qualities of our society, the lousy deck dealt to black men growing up in urban city neighborhoods. It dramatizes - but not by much - the way that opportunities are systematically stripped from you in a society where you're rarely respected or afforded the benefit of the doubt. Definitely a worthwhile movie.
Only one thing - I missed the first five minutes of the movie, and suspect I was better off for it. The beginning lists some stastics that indicate the direction the plot will eventually take, and lends a more moralizing, heavy tone to the movie. Without the intro, the movie stands well by itself and affects you without telling you how you should be affected.",1062288000,12,1303,4.645021645021645
1805678,5,B00007BK2S,"A movie so sad, yet so good. With real reactions from the characters and the harsh effects, this movie touched aspects of life we wish we won't ever go through... I respect the movie for how much reality it had: fears, tears,all things we could be cowards to admit. I respect the movie for its creativeness in songs and situations, but for the most part,for showing me how glamour and fame should be the least thing we should focus on in our lives, after all, we all each just have one life or one death.",1062201600,2,504,4.315789473684211
1805679,5,B00007BK2S,"This movie gave a very good insight about how crime and prison are destroying many inner city families. I think that Q-Tip, Mary J. Blige, and Fat Joe gave strong dramatic performances. I recommend that this movie be viewed by all those who are interested in inner city life.",1052697600,3,275,4.63265306122449
1805680,5,B00007BK2S,"I saw the edited version of this film which did little justice to the actual film which I found to run like a stage play not to say that this is a bad thing. Prison Song is one of the better examples of films on the ""prison"" theme. I would say the best one was perhaps the classic Cool Hand Luke, but in post-modern times we have OZ which some of said has lost some of it's focus. Though Prison Song is not as in depth as perhaps OZ is, it's still worth at least a rental. For those who are irritated by musicals, you may want to consider renting before buying. If you do purchase this film, you won't be disappointed.",1045180800,6,618,4.073770491803279
1805681,5,B00007BK2S,OMG I LOVE THIS MOVIES SOOOO MUCH.. I THINK IT IS THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER.. ITS SOOO SAD BUT TELLS SUCH A GREAT STORY I HAVE SEEN IT SOO MANY TIMES..

1805682,4,B00007BK2S,"When I saw that rappers and singers were in this movie I thought it was gonna be a dud but I was surprised. Q-Tip was focused in his role and did a good job. I LOVED seeing Mary J in this movie (I may be biased because I am a huge fan).
Fat Joe also did a good job a well as the supporting actors.",1038614400,3,297,3.5846153846153848
1805683,5,B00007BK2S,"Saw this film on B.E.T one late night when i was in Jamaica,and was blown away! What a Film!! Documents the life of a young man (played by Q-tip) from the disasterous break up of his mom and boyfriend through his stay in differant group homes to his own incarceration while highlighting the various injustices and problems faced by poor black people in America (and by poor, disadvataged people the world over),especially when dealing with the justice, education and social service systems. This is a film that you are convinced will have a happy ending especially when the young 'tip finds a way to express himself through photography and finds the ultimate ghetto sweatheart in a basketball playing girl with similar problems but when things go wrong for 'tip boy do they go wroung!
  In short this film had me buggin out for at least a week after i saw it which increased my disapointment when i couldn't find it in Chicago! If you looking for a powerfull and startling look at life on the hardside and how easy everything can be taken from you with an inspirational edge cop it,NOW!",1038096000,,1086,4.680628272251309

1805688,5,B00007BK2S,"I love this film. It gives a real picture if what's happening today. It does a very good job of describing a community that is struggling with multiple social ills on a daily basis. Miseducation, weak community relations, poor health care, inadequate youth intervention, disrespectful and inhumane community policing, drug abuse and a criminal justice system that ignores the fact that victim and offender my both be victims.",1418601600,2,425,5.264705882352941

1805692,5,B00007BK2S,I use to watch this movie evertime it aired on B.E.T. I just had to add it to my collection. I love the music in it and Mary J Blidge didn't do so bad in this acting role.,1396828800,,171,3.526315789473684
1805693,5,B00007BK2S,"This was a perfectly crafted movie.  With the exception of a few people in the movie (namely Mary J. Blige and Fat Joe), the acting was superb.  Q-Tip did a great job at portraying a young black male who made a decision in defense, who becomes defenseless against the system that imprisons him.  All of his dreams, talents, and aspirations are lost to the system-indeed a sad story.  At the end of the movie, you also get a better appreciation just how destructive and non-conducive the prison ""business"" is.",1389312000,,508,4.674157303370786

1805695,4,B00007BK2S,"Watching this movie through the eye of a cable network was not what it was made for.  Darnel Martin and Q-Tip did their thing.  The story line and music was very interesting.  The tale is not unfamiliar at all, though, the execution is.  This film gets to the point very quickly.  In it's depiction of environment and mentality.  The message is one of responsibility and regret.  It's all about choices.",1380672000,,403,4.671428571428572

1805705,5,B00007BK2S,I bought the movie because I love Mary J.

1805706,5,B00007BK2S,"this was a great movie. i thought it would be lackluster and semi comedic since it had rappers in it. though they aren't exactly thespians, this movie was great. i was sad at the end.",1192665600,,183,4.257142857142857
1805707,4,B00007BK2S,I thought this movie was a major attempt to illuminate the struggle in inner city life. It would have been one of success and triumph except for a system that tends funnel many people into the criminal justice enviornment. Most importantly it showed how the profit motives of the criminal justice systems rewards what can only be called current day slave holders all under the glaring eyes of serving justice. It should be watched not on BET with commercials destroying the pace and fabric of the film maker but in a theatre or if not possible at home. Beautiful performance by Mary J and the rest of the case. KUDOS,1165968000,,616,4.609090909090909
1805708,3,B00007BK2S,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I watched it for the first time two days ago. Loved the scene with Qtip putting his hands up as if they were a camera and taking pictures, ""Click, click"".

1805710,5,B00007BK2S,this movie is a good life explaining movie about a normal african american male whos childhood was troubled by the law...and how so many convicts doesnt have the mentality to survive in prison and how they just have a emontional breakdowns...cuz they want their freedom and that they go through extreme extents just to obtain it even when they face death just to posses that certain freedom they long for..that death may be the only way a convicts freedom will be obtained,1103500800,2,472,4.7682926829268295
1805711,4,B00007BK2S,Prison Song was a great movie with a good cast and awesome music to go  along with the emotions of the characters.  I've been trying to find the soundtract to the movie but have had no luck. This is a type of movie you can watch over and over agian and still feel all the emotions of the characters.  It goes deep into the system and shows the violence within it.  The fight to stay inocennt is taking away with one second of wrong doing.,1082764800,2,438,4.117647058823529
1805712,5,B00007BK2S,"BET's Prison Song offers a look into the life of an inner city teenager, Elijah, (Tip) who gets stuck in the system after his mother is institutionalized.  Sent to a private jail after accidentally killing someone (Fat Joe) from his group home, Prison Song follows Elijah as he comes to terms with the harsh realization that even though he is innocent, the only way out is to escape.  The tragic ending of this unusually un-musical musical leaves the viewer wanting to break the cycle, but ultimately feeling helpless against it.",1081814400,3,529,4.866666666666666

It has such a moving story line, you get absorbed in it the second you turn it on. I have been searching for the soundtrack, but especially the artist and songtitle of the closing track during the credits. It is a beautifully written and acted movie, i recommend it to anyone who is interested in Q-Tip or the movie itself. You will never forget the impact that Prison Song has on your life.",1081728000,,506,4.173469387755102
