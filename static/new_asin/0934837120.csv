7793429,5,0934837120,The movie was in great shape and it was amazing. It was worth it in the end. I'll defiantly buy more from here.,1393632000,,111,3.869565217391304
7793430,1,0934837120,"A lot of cable stations play substandard flicks like this when they don't show the good stuff.  This movie has the predictable chase scene, the predictible kidnapping, and the predictible boudoir action.  If you loved seeing Michael Rooker and his basement in ""Mallrats,"" you'll like seeing him and his basement here.  This time, he has cranial hair and it looks great on him.  Don't get me wrong:  some will like this flick.  Still, many will see that it's the same ol', same ol'.  It is just basically nothing to write home about.  It's not despicable, but it's not praiseworthy either.",1207526400,,588,4.81
7793431,5,0934837120,"This film is difficult to watch. It is short, yet you will never forget what you will see during this brief presentation. Some thirty-five million unborn American children have had their lives brutally snuffed out in utero.  This film demonstrates the brutality of this so called ""proceedure"". It also demonstrates how well developed even the earliest aborted unborn babies are. This film was made by a group of individuals who filmed the remains of little unborn children found in a dumpster behind an abortion clinic in Houston, Texas. As a health professional, I have known this truth for a long time.  It's about time that the American public be shown the truth.",988675200,8,666,4.9375
7793432,5,0934837120,"It's an ""operation"" that takes place over a million times each year in the United States. But you will never see it on the news. You won't see it on ER. You won't even see it on ""the surgery channel"" on cable.
What ""surgery"" will never be shown? Abortion, of course. After you watch this video, you will know why. This video displays abortion as it is; as the bloody, violent killing of an unborn human being. It will make you physically ill. It will break your heart and move you to tears. And hopefully it will move you to work to end abortion.",981763200,7,546,4.259615384615385
