2569612,2,B000FJGR76,"What pain a screenwriter must face when a script with such potential is subverted into something so poorly acted and badly cast.

At first, I was quite content ignoring how strained and contrived the film was by enjoying the beautiful cinematography.  But after a while, even that got to me, because it was wholly inappropriate for this film.

How can one take the film seriously when embarrassingly common and well known policies and procedures regarding prisons are so blatantly ignored, to the point where the audience is insulted by the license taken with reality?  It's downright stupid to think someone with no experience, training or certification can roam the prison freely, copulating with death row inmates and ultimately execute them.  Yeah, I know it's entertainment, but if I'm forced by my functioning brain cells to involuntarily nitpick, the suspension of disbelief is lost off the charts.  This COULD have worked with masterful delivery and direction, an area where this film is lacking.

If one strains enough, the gleamings of a funny script could be recognized on occasion.  Think ""To Die For"", ""Clay Pigeons"", or any of the wonderful films by the Coen Brothers.  This was the potential.  What was delivered disappoints.  Heavily.  As an absolute devout fan of the dark comedy genre, I found nothing entertaining about Love Comes to the Executioner.

I blame the director for this mess.  It was badly acted and the jokes and political/religious commentary was delivered with all the finesse of a bad sitcom.  He should have reigned in his talented Director of Photography, too, because the tracking shots and and great lighting were conspicuous and overkill.  But because of the nice visual distraction, I gave this film two stars instead of one.",1183766400,5,1766,5.079861111111111
2569613,5,B000FJGR76,"I saw this at SXSW, last year and just found out it's available. Very sick and funny!

Essentially, the hero just graduated from college with a degree in Classical Languages. He wants to teach high school Latin but ends up being a prison executioner in the small town where he grew up.

Complicating matters, his big brother's on death row (for trying to kill him) and so is his brother's ex-girlfriend. Creating a uniquely hilarious love triangle.

I found out that the lead, Jonathan Tucker, actually took Latin in high school. Making his scenes trying to teach Latin to the prisoners even funnier.

If you like Monty Python, Harold and Maude and Grosse Point Blank, you'll like this.",1147651200,24,686,4.788135593220339
2569614,5,B000FJGR76,"I bought this movie, because i saw a video Jeremy Renner singing ""American Pie"", a song that i love very much.
But i must say that the film was very cool. A very fun love triangle. Craziest prison!",1418169600,,197,4.2105263157894735

2569620,3,B000FJGR76,"I only watched it because Jeremy Renner was in it.  You will know the plot after watching just a bit of it.  It's absurd and mildly funny...which I think is what the filmmaker intended... It just doesn't quite hit the mark.  Ginnifer Goodwin and Jeremy Renner are good in their roles, as is Jonathan Tucker.  And, there are a couple of funny scenes, one with the mother... Watch it, don't watch it...",1378512000,,400,4.513888888888889

2569624,5,B000FJGR76,I love this movie!!! I loved the relationship between the two brothers and all the characters had their shining moment. My very favorite moment was when Chick sang American Pie :-) I recommend this film to people who like dark comedies. It was not too dark though...just a little bit. Jeremy Renner is a phenomenal actor-just in case you hadn't figured that out! lol,1362268800,,366,4.734375

I love the movie.  It is an Indy film with a little of everything in it.  The cast did a bang up job in their delivery of their performances.",1349049600,,271,4.056603773584905

2569629,4,B000FJGR76,"There are so many things I could say about this movie. It's a great early film of a lot of familiar faces, and well done without a huge budget. The characters are all delightfully absurd, and the story while being relatively predictable, is a fun ride. It's a dark comedy along the lines of Eulogy or Sunshine Cleaning, but just a little more over the top (and the film knows it). One of the highlights is the mother who used to be in the adult film business and likes to watch her old movies when she's feeling depressed (she even named one of her sons after a fellow star...).",1342137600,,578,4.3119266055045875

2569633,4,B000FJGR76,"Kyle Bergersen wrote and directed this very strange comedic film noir, a movie that didn't get a lot of attention in its theatrical release but that is gaining a following in the DVD format.  It is smart, clever, weird, and very well made.  Bergersen has the ability to take a rather silly story to reveal a lot of important questions about education, capital punishment, prison life, and the delicate balance between humanity and inhumanity!  LOVE COMES TO THE EXECUTIONER works.

Heck Prigusivac (Jonathan Tucker) is a fresh graduate form college, having majored in Latin and Romance Languages, who returns to his small hometown where his ditsy alcoholic mother Miriam (Christine Ebersole) struggles with her addiction and with the fact that her son Chick (Jeremy Renner) sits on Death Row in the neighboring prison.  Heck lands a job teaching Latin to the inmates, but with the proviso that he also accept the job as Closer (or Executioner). Heck adjusts to the strange situation and manages to learn the trade of capital punishment by lethal injection.  He confronts his estranged brother Chick on death row and the two have word battles about their relationship AND the fact that Chick's ex-girlfriend Dori Dumchovic (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the first female to sit on death row a few cells down form Chick.  Heck and Dori flirt and Heck 'falls' for Dori, actually impregnating her in the confines of the prison.  Heck manages to become a popular Latin teacher with the inmates, but has some psychological stress as the Closer - especially as the time for Heck to execute Dori approaches. Through a clever trick that backfires, Heck agrees to help Dori escape the prison so that the two can raise their 'child', but Chick's streetwise abilities alter the plan, and love doesn't exactly stay around for the executioner!

Tucker, Renner, and Goodwin play the script straight and manage to draw us into their individual plights and dilemmas.  The cinematography by Jimmy Lindsey keeps this 'interior' film exciting, even during the rather gross execution scenes.  It is a strange way to present anti-capital punishment information, along side the death of the teaching of Latin and the Romance languages as markers for civility, that makes this film worth watching. It is a notch above the similar stories that dumb down the audience.  Grady Harp, January 08",1199232000,7,2357,5.030848329048843

8123700,5,B000FJGR76,"I don't know why this movie is so overlooked. How can a movie with the college graduate driving home with his car piled high with his belongings while wearing his ridiculous cap and gown, who returns home to his mother who tries to get him to appreciate her former days as a porn star, since she watches them constantly and tells him to grow up when he is repulsed, then wants to teach Latin to the prison inmates, not be funny? I hurt myself laughing so hard. As a bonus, Jeremy Renner! You can't go wrong. Plus plus, Jennifer Goodwin. Far from her usual sweet roles, she's the former crush of our guy, who happens to have dated his brother and is on death row, a few cells down from said brother, who is also waiting to walk the green mile. This gem is only for people who appreciate the absurd and dry humor. I would say this movie is just about perfect with the sarcasm, outlandish premise, exceptional casting, but for one thing: no subtitles. As someone who is hard of hearing, that's a major downside. But it was so hilarious I still gave it five stars and cranked the volume way up. I hope you give it a try and go in knowing to leave all seriousness outside the door. It is so entertaining, in fact, that I'm going to watch it again tomorrow.",1526256000,,1251,4.305084745762712

8123708,5,B000FJGR76,"Let me tell you how much I enjoyed this little unknown movie. This dark comedy with dramatic overtones is a gem. Jonathan Tucker is the crown that the gem rests on. Why he has never made it huge is beyond me. He has a college education in spite of the family predilection toward murder, his brother is on death row and his father was already put to death....where is the comedy? Jonathan Tucker can't get a job except as the executioner in the prison! the dialog between every character is priceless. His mom is dying from drinking and smoking, he falls in love with the only woman on death row who also happens to be his brothers girlfriend. I loved the performances, Jeremy Renner plays the brother. But how can this lead to anything? check it out, really!",1424995200,,758,4.5
