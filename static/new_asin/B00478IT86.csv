The focus of the movie is high-altitude skiers who climb some of the highest peaks in the world carrying their skis then challenge those slopes, making dangerous descents when they lock on their skis.

These athletes challenge their bodies as they refuse to use supplemental oxygen and dare death as they risk all for the ultimate thrill.

From Alaska to Tibet, directors Mike Marolt and Les Guthman, follow their small circle of friends and fellow sportsmen as they test themselves by setting higher and higher goals.  No stuntmen or special effects can create the thrills that these athletes do by locking in their skis and doing what they love.

The documentary proves that despite all the advances in computer technology and other sciences, the planet's majestic creations remain our most wondrous special effects and that men pitting their skills against nature still is the simplest and most",1291593600,,950,4.987341772151899

8417824,4,B00478IT86,"This is a good movie as a follow-up to the classic, The Man Who Skied Everest.  It captures the dedication of those who love the challenges of skiing the highest, most remote peaks.  Great photography and interviews.",1387929600,,216,4.8108108108108105
8417825,3,B00478IT86,The scenery was Amazing but the story seemed to drag. The fact that the area is littered with dead bodies no one ever comes back to claimed repulsive. Not a story of inspiration but desperation.,1387756800,,194,4.571428571428571
8417826,3,B00478IT86,"There are some very good shots of big mountains and some good skiing action.  There is a bit too much talking and face time from the climber / skiers but if you like big mountains and skiing, how can you go wrong?",1359072000,,213,4.071428571428571
8417827,4,B00478IT86,"I certainly don't have the Marolts' dare-devil proclivities, but I think I share their love of the freedom that skiing seems to engender, and that comes through quite brilliantly in this surprisingly thoughtful piece of filmmaking.

There are certainly a lot of shots of high-altitude skiing, both the titular Everest quest, as well as several previous high-altitude adventures in places as disparate as South America and Alaska, but this really is a more personal story than one might initially think going into it.  This is certainly miles away from those old Warren Miller ski spectaculars.

8417829,3,B00478IT86,"Seemed like an interesting buy, but basically it's a few dudes who got into climbing up/skiing down mountains, but never really learned how to put together a compelling movie or, for that matter, how to take full advantage of the visual majesty of their setting.

Mostly NOT shot in HD, lots of older standard-def footage with some HD mixed in.  If you can get it for less than $5, worth a look, but won't end up a permanent part of most peoples' collection.",1298937600,5,458,4.506024096385542
