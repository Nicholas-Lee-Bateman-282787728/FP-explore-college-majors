7281558,5,B00ZGIOMEQ,Our two year old loves to watch the videos in the car on the way to our destinations.

I remember watching this when I was a child and it still appeals to kids today.,1496707200,5,265,4.018867924528302
7281559,4,B00ZGIOMEQ,Bought this for my one year old daughter. I loved this growing up and I know she will too. She loves the upbeat music and dances along to it. The storylines are always good and wholesome. One downside is that there are not any subtitles available. The dvd quality isn't high but is about what you expect from that low price. Which isn't a huge deal to us.,1495152000,,355,4.235294117647059

7281565,5,B00ZGIOMEQ,This collection is great! So glad to find somewhere my three year old can watch these shows. There's so many on here. Amazon prime only has about the first five episodes available. These are older episode so the image quality isn't great but that was expected. And my daughter didn't seem to mind.,1492646400,2,297,4.622641509433962

7281616,4,B00ZGIOMEQ,"I thoroughly love this cartoon. The DVD set gives me everything I wanted, only problem is that the DVD is aesthetically lacking. While that's nothing really important, I do wish that it felt more like a collection rather than burned discs full of episodes.

Otherwise, I do recommend the purchase.",1472601600,,297,4.94

I loved how the story would go about the life of a spunky little French girl who went on adventures with her friends and their beloved nurse like nun and others tending to the adventurous little girls lead by the red haired spunky titular character. I loved this series and I still do to this day. I can now keep another piece of my childhood with me and keep another good memory with me to my collection.",1531440000,,527,4.076923076923077
