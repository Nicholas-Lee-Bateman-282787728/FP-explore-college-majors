8495657,4,B006A8XFRG,"A.K.A.Dragonfly is the original title which is the very loosely woven theme of this movie. I can understand why most critics may not enjoy this film. True, there's much to pick apart, i.e., poor acting (Jesse, played by Beau Bridges, seems stiff, almost robotic in his dialog), and not well defined character roles (Chloe's part, played by Susan Sarandon, is not well defined: her motivation for her persistent devotion to Jesse is unclear). Nevertheless, if you, like me, like these emotionally disturbed/psychotic mother's psychologically  corrupting their offspring type movies, then this is one for you too. Parts of the movie are almost campy, not that they're intended to be, but for example the scene at the Happiness Motel with Pearlie, played by Ann Wedgeworth, had me rolling in laughter. For the most part, all the women acting parts in this film held the movie together. I especially I enjoyed Willa's role, played by Linda Miller, as the mother of a ""Mongoloid"" child whom Jesse amazingly, to the mother, connects with. Miss Barrow's part, played by Mildred Dunnock, toward the end, is exceptional.

I saw the film first on the THIS channel, but missed the beginning, and I was intrigued by it but, until recently, couldn't find a copy except in VHS which was then very pricey. I've seen it twice now and it is probably good for at least a third viewing. Final thoughts, enjoyable if one is not too critical - very good story.",1328572800,2,1439,4.869387755102041
