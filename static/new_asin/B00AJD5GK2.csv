8552627,3,B00AJD5GK2,"If one-step-beyond-a-beginner-water-color-lesson is what you are looking for, then Janet Nunn presents a really good basic lesson - step by step - with clear explanation of the process. (In other words, you know what to do with a brush, what paper to use, etc.)  It would be a great video for a beginner who wants to draw and paint an old car, but I was looking for more advanced techniques hoping to learn more about the hydrus watercolors she uses.  Probably will donate this to our library.",1396656000,2,493,4.655172413793103
