7879898,5,6304940890,"The Reggae Movie is the best Reggae DVD everr produced. It is mastered in Dolby Digital so if you have a Dolby Digital sound system its gonna blow you outta your seat!! The picture quality is almost high def. All shot in Digital Beta. The performances range from Jamaica to Australia to Japan, to Miami. All of the classic artists performing roots to dancehall!

7879900,1,6304940890,"This would have to be the worst collection of flat sounding reggae clips i have ever seen. The audio is so flat and compressed that even if there was something interesting on it, it would not be enjoyable. Complete waste of money.",1058054400,7,230,4.5
7879901,3,6304940890,"This video may be a little boring by today's standards (it's about 10 + yrs old), but the coverage of DENNIS BROWN, LUCIANO, SHAGGY, MAXI PRIEST, YAMI BOLO, AND GARNETT SILK are crucial 'must have' items for any true reggae music collector!
The production & editing are excellent (especially by REGGAE standards....as many reggae videos are poorly produced)",1023148800,9,357,5.172413793103448
7879902,5,6304940890,"I've been to Jamaica twice and I love the country and its culture. If you are a ""serious"" (pronounced ""seros"" in Jamaican Patois), this is a must have Item on your collection. There is nothing more  than seeing your faveorite Reggae and Dancehall artists perform live in  your own living room!",943660800,20,293,4.7254901960784315
