2152176,2,B0002ZDWK8,"The idea that this could have inspired Predator is laughable.  This is probably the lowest budget movie I have ever seen.  The ""space monsters"" are guys in black with diving tanks.  Interesting how the monsters carry the exact same kind of guns the Earthlings do?  Like they all were owned by the same guy?  No, this is pure silliness.  If you're looking for a Lash Larue movie, check out one of his westerns when he was in his prime; this is not his best work.  But it is good natured, and the lead girl has astonishingly pretty legs, so if you like those grade Z style movies, give it a shot.",1206662400,7,594,4.297297297297297
2152177,3,B0002ZDWK8,"First, I did enjoy this movie and knew what I bought was going to challenge my personal integrity and value as a human being.

Alien Outlaw is a flick you might enjoy at a Drive In Movie that cost $1 per carload showing a few movies for that $1. As a child I enjoyed Lash La Rue and most of those old cowboy serials on 1950's T.V. programs, maybe you did too. These old cowpokes in this movie perform adequately for their age and it is nice to see them, most are gone now. Alien Outlaw is definitely one of those really strange cultish films and there are people on this planet who find it might be something to give them a great pleasure in it's ability to amaze and stupify. The Aliens are muggish frogmen and the cutie with the guns is very nice to look at as are most of the females, the dialogue is sorted, most of the actors try hard, Lash never uses a whip in this movie, ( I was disappointed) there is a horse and several 80's model cars, and a gas station. It may cause you to laugh. Small review. See the movie.",1135814400,23,1021,4.105
8035165,5,B0002ZDWK8,"I like the films of Phil Smoot writer/directer.  Very fun B movies.  I think the acting was good in that the characters were true to the time and place.
Lash La Rue was perfectly cast and Kari Anderson was very cute and nicely played her role (love her outfits!!).  For those who criticize, there are some seriously bad B movies out there.  I think this one pulled off a fun, classic B style film.  In the special feature commentary he speaks of all the things they went through while making this film.  Very creative...""necessity is the mother of invention!""  I actually purchased this after viewing with RiffTrax.  There is a interview with Kari Anderson (filmed at the time they were making the movie) and for me, that was worth the price alone.",1515283200,,748,4.613636363636363

8035167,3,B0002ZDWK8,"""Alien Outlaw"" is an extremely cheaply made B-movie from 1985 with a threat from space so ludicrous it's not worth the time it takes to discuss. If you are looking for something on the order of ""Predator"", this will not be to your liking. It's essentially a space western with a sharpshooting girl, Jesse Jamison (Kari Anderson, in a ludicrous outfit), who has her own traveling show as the heroine. She duels it out with insanely cheap frogmen from space brandishing revolvers, while she negotiates her way to a new contract with The Diamond booking Agency: you'll hear way more about that than you ever wanted to, and you'll see her sleazy manager's gratuitous full mane of back hair as an unsavory bonus.

The film has some annoying and amusing diversions. On the annoying side of the house is a clear nominee for the most grating phone call in cinema history and the most ludicrous argument about hunting in history (on a related side note: a holster over boxer shorts is a fashion faux pas.) On the amusing side of the house are performances from two gentlemanly stars of westerns from decades ago, Sunset Carson and Lash La Rue. Also appearing as ""Brown Horse"" is ""Happy Wingo"". I loved the line ""She's the Annie Oakley of the '80s!"" (Courtesy of The Diamond Booking Agency, of course.) If you want to watch some tense contract negotiation, this is the alien western for you.

""Alien Outlaw"" was filmed largely on location in Sparta, NC, and has an enjoyable folksy appeal if you like B-movies or westerns. The DVD features a surprising number of extras including a good commentary track with director Phil Smoot, interviews with Carson and La Rue (both sadly now deceased), and Kari Anderson, who hails from White Bear Lake, MN and made her big screen debut in this film. There is also a news conference discussing the shooting of the film, a trailer for ""Dark Power"" (also with La Rue), and even Lash reciting some of his poetry.

""Alien Outlaw"" is a classic example of mid '80s low budget filmmaking and if you can overlook incredibly hokey special effects (or like your special effects that way) and some sporadically bad acting and see it for the camp classic it is, it's an enjoyable departure from predictable Hollywood science fiction movies.",1439596800,3,2256,4.764705882352941
8035168,2,B0002ZDWK8,I bought this because it was Lash La Rue's last movie.  I kind of did enjoy it.  If you can get it cheap buy it.  Other than that...,1378857600,,132,3.642857142857143

""ALIEN OUTLAW"" (1985) ~ (90 min/Color) ~ Starring: Lash La Rue, Kari Anderson, Paul Holman, Gil Newsome, Richard Davis, Liz Warrington, Sunset Carson, Bill Cody Jr, Paul Holman

Directed by Phil Smoot

If you enjoy over the top campy Sci-fi, then look no more, this is one of the classics with Lash, Sunset and Bill Cody.  Filmed and directed by Phil Smoot, on a shoe string budget and the bear minimums, but what he could do with what he had is amazing.  Kari Anderson looks great, but that's about it.  This is a fun viewing, which can tickle your funny bone if you let it ~ Recommend 3 1/2 stars!

2nd of the double feature:
""THE DARK POWER"" (1987) ~ (81 min/Color) ~ Starring: Lash La Rue, Anna Lane Tatum, Cynthia Bailey, Mary Dalton, Paul Holman, Mighty Joe Coltrane

Directed by Phil Smoot

This is a blast from the past, with another Phil Smoot film featuring everyone's favorite B-Western cowboy Lash LaRue.  Here we find sorority girls and out of sorts Native Americans, that call for the whip from Lash.  Poor girls are being chased here and there with the bull whip champion ready for action.  The acting is passable, but the zombies give it their best shot, as Lash comes into his own with his favorite weapon for defense, you guessed it his special whip! ~ Recommend 4 stars!

8035172,3,B0002ZDWK8,"A few months ago, I ordered and watched THE DARK POWER, the first film from North Carolina low-budget auteur Phil Smoot, and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It's very cheap, low-budget fun, made all the more entertaining for me because the filmmakers seem to be taking their work - though not themselves, necessarily - very seriously.  I'm not entirely how true the portrait of Ed Wood in Tim Burton's film of the same name is - but picture a guy like that and you've got it pretty much.  Anyway, like I said, good cheesy fun and Smoot only made one other film, so I decided I had to get it.

Alas despite this being made after THE DARK POWER, it's less professional and generally a lower quality effort all around.  For one thing the acting is just horrendous; the earlier film is about a bunch of college girls set upon by spirits of dead Indians, and the actresses seem like...dumb college girls, so it basically works.  In ALIEN OUTLAW you've got a very mediocre actress (Kari Anderson in her only performance, apparently) chosen I suspect for her spectacular legs and rear end, which she shows off to great advantage in a skimpy cowgirl costume early in the film.  She's professional trick shot Jesse Jamison (ha-ha get it?), and the plot of the film concerns aliens which look like cheap CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON knockoffs who come to earth to hunt humans for sport with our own weapons.  They get ahold of some of Jesse's guns and go on a little spree, and it's up to our modern western heroine to take 'em out.

Not a bad premise really - with a certain similarity you might note to PREDATOR, which actually came out 2 years later - but the film does nothing with it.  Lots of long, inane dialogue scenes with Jesse getting mad at her lazy manager, a terrible interview scene as she tries to get a better gig, and a few old b-western stars trotted out because presumably director/writer Smoot liked them and they worked cheap.  Lash LaRue, the star of his previous film, is featured here but doesn't even get to use a whip (his trademark) and just plays the lame role of Jesse's sort-of mentor who keeps talking about how bad a cook he is.  Very poor action sequences and some dreadful editing and continuity problems; basically what the film has going for it is some nice scenery of the North Carolina hills - and the young female varieties.  Anderson has a nice smile and great long wavy 70s hair to go with her nice backside; she probably could have had something of a career but for whatever reason didn't.  And neither did Smoot after his two initial efforts failed to do anything even on video at the time.  No loss, really; much as I like to see regional filmmakers who don't want to sell out and make the Hollywood compromises, I'm not sure Smoot had much to offer.

The DVD presentation, though, like that of THE DARK POWER, is first rate.  Both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film are offered, there's a director commentary which is probably going to be most interesting to other would-be low-budget indie filmmakers, and a few short interviews and behind-the-scenes videos.  I don't know if Smoot or the film have some kind of cult following, or manufacturer VCI is trying to create one, but somehow the loving attention given to this crappy film wins me over to some extent, and a 2-star film overall gets 3 in this review for the attention it's given.  And, frankly, bad as it is I had some fun.  Connoisseurs of cheese could certainly do worse.",1263427200,3,3478,4.552166934189406
