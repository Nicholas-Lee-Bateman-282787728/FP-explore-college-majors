Of course, such an environmentally-different person pays a price-emotionally, professionally and even physically while being near murdered by racist thugs at the central Melbourne train station,""Flinders Street Station"", in a broad light day, no help from responsible citizens surrounding.

A very realistic work is of a real interest to enjoying realistic movies of a living life in different countries, in such a still mysterious to foreigners place as Australia definitely.",1166140800,,1212,5.869318181818182
