8552880,4,B00AJXO2XE,"Whether you have embraced the Zombie vibe or not this movie will draw you in. I wouldn't be caught dead in a Zombie costume but I loved this movie. You'll wish you'd been part of the Fort Myers Zombie walk and contest.  The filmmakers make you feel like you're right in the middle of the fun loving madness. While the regular version is much better color and sharpness the 3D can't be beat for feeling the Zombies brush past you.  Terrific movie for your own Zombie party, family night or sleepover.",1357344000,,499,4.472527472527473
