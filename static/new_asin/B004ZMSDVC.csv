8752561,1,B004ZMSDVC,"This was a gift for my husband, as he has been a huge fan of Tankboy but we couldn't find these episodes anywhere. I decided to search on Amazon, and was so thrilled to find it! Well FINALLY he decided to sit down and watch these. What a huge disappointment!! The quality is so horrific! All pixellated and blurry. I don't know if these are illegal copies, but all I can say is it sucks! DO NOT BUY! These aren't even watchable. Shame on this seller for even selling such crap!",1471910400,,477,4.252747252747253
