8313186,1,B001JP63A6,"This DVD is truly horrid.  The conversion to DVD is poor.  It's a combination of shots of buildings and a camera set to run on a canal cruise. The narrator rattles off facts and historical dates in no particular order.  I think they just shot footage and someone read over the vidio from a very dull historical guide book.  This doesn't even show Tivoli Gardens, just buildings and canals.  Not even popular gathering places or eateries are mentioned.  Don't waste your money.",1334102400,,476,4.7439024390243905
