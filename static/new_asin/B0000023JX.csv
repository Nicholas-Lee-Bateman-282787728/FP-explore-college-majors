7902135,4,B0000023JX,"Tina Bockrath provides a fun opening.

Peggy McIntaggart is the dud of the video despite having nice boobs her segments are just boringly slow.

Karen Foster gives us some giggly action.

Helle Michaelson continues the giggly fun.

Erika Eleniak has an interestingly weird segment.

Bonnie Marino is one cute babe.

Pam Anderson looks good.

Renee Tenison has good clips.

Lisa Matthews is my personal favorite although these aren't her best clips.

Deborah Driggs does some nice dancing.

Petra Verkaik is probably the highlight of this video.

Jacqueline Sheen provides an adequate closing.",1270771200,,592,5.326086956521739
7902136,2,B0000023JX,"Playboy 1991 Video Playmate Calendar is 59 minutes long and was released on video on November 19, 1991. Remember the old Wendy's commercial where the lady is asking where the beef is, well the same could be said for this video: where's the nudity. The only Playmate who made any real attempt was Renee Tenison. I enjoyed watching the coming attractions then this video; at least the ladies were nude. Here is how commented on each Playmate.

Tina Bockrath\Miss January-Mainly topless, never shown fully nude
Peggy McIntaggart\Miss February-Never shown truly nude, some breasts scenes
Karen Foster\Miss March-Topless in twirling segment, no clothes on from the hips down in the second half
Helle Michaelson\Miss April-Nude last half of first segment, some skin in second segment
Erika Eleniak\Miss May-Shown nude in brief one second clips
Bonnie Marino\Miss June-Shown mainly topless in the jeep segment and a few seconds of full nudity, full nudity in the tent scene, but it is mostly hidden
Pamela Anderson\Miss July-Only about 5% of the time is she fully nude
Renee Tenison\Miss August (Playmate of the Year for 1990)-Nude in dessert scene, nude at times in the gym, and nude most of the time in the final segment
Lisa Matthews\Miss September (Playmate of the Year for 1991)-Topless first half and nude in an artistic sense in second half
Deborah Driggs\Miss October-Topless first scene, clothes are on 98% of the time in second scene, nude in last scene
Petra Veraik\Miss November-Topless starting of then full nudity in opening scene, topless in pool table scene
Jacqueline Sheen\Miss December-Some skin first half, full nudity second half

I just though this video bombed. Playboy 1991 Video Playmate Calendar deserves a D-.",1244073600,,1729,5.193548387096774

I was all revved-up to see Pamela Anderson in the buff, but little did I know what surprises were in store for me after I popped the tape into the VCR. It goes without saying that all of the Playmates are absolutely stunning, and I was so eager to see Pamela frolicking happily in the nude. When I saw her portion of the tape I realized how typical she was compared with the other gorgeous women. Mind you this was 10 years ago, and since then I think Pamela has gotten better looking, as opposed to the video shoot where she was attractive but not any more so than the other Playmates. What really rocked me were the sultriness of Karen Foster's shoot, and the sheer beauty of Peggy McIntaggart. I enjoyed both of these models video shoots but the camera angles could have been better. Debra Driggs is an absolute doll; unfortunately we don't see enough of her luscious buns in the video. Overall, I would say Petra Verkaik gave the best shoot. She danced, pranced, and burned up the screen; and she was not shy about displaying herself. Nowadays when I watch the tape I just skip them all and sit mesmerized by lust for Ms. Verkaik.
