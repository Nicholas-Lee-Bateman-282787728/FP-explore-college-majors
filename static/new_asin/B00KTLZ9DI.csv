6446254,5,B00KTLZ9DI,"OK!  I just HAVE to write this review.  I initially purchased a 'silver' E-M10.  I loved the little camera and used it occasionally.  Then my friend from many years past contacted me.  He is a master with B&W photography.  He prints B&W on fiber paper to the quality and expertise of Ansel Adams prints using an Olympus Pen 4/3 micro.  I recently, got my 'head back in the game' as I used to be a fashion photographer as well as a scenic photographer.  Many years ago I promised myself that I would have a 'green' camera after seeing a Special Edition Leica for $8,000, but couldn't afford it.  When Olympus, recently offered their 'Special Editions' I knew I had to have the 'green' model.  I sold all of my Canon 6D system to get another E-M10 (Special Edition).  I haven't 'looked back' since.  What a great camera!  It as a full on-board computer and I think I could fly a Beechcraft airplane easier than learn all the capabilities of the E-M10.  But, Hey!  I'm somewhat OCD so I'll get my head into this camera by absorbing all the tutorials and getting back on the street to do 'street photography'.  This is a great DVD and it explains several items that are not covered in the Olympus owners manual.  This DVD is very informative, it will illustrate and show you just what the camera can be programed to do.  It is impressive.  So far I've picked up the 12-42mm (standard) lens, the 12-42mm (EZ lens), the 12-40mm ""pro' lens, the 40-150mm lens and the 150-300mm lens.  I'm ready to go.  Let go take some photos.",1410825600,4,1519,4.470802919708029

8661449,4,B00KTLZ9DI,"I just finished watching this video. I had worked my way through the intruction manual a couple of times, but this was a much more orderly proression. I found the explanations of ""how"" to do the various adjustments and settings quite useful, but thought the trainer could have provided a bit more info about ""why"" you might want to make specific adjustments. He did explain the whys in some cases, but found there were others where I was left wondering. All in all, it was quite helpful and I may need to maake another pass through it as I get more experience with this camera. The camera itself has much more capability than I expect I'll ever need. I was in awe thinking about the myriad of adjustments I could make.",1443744000,,718,4.488549618320611
8661450,5,B00KTLZ9DI,Very informative. It covers alot about this camera. Only problem I have is that the narrator sometimes goes through the topics very quickly. I wish they also had the information in this DVD in text book form.,1436918400,,208,4.648648648648648

8661453,2,B00KTLZ9DI,I thought the video was good in that it went through all the functions but I was disappointed and give it only 2 stars because it does not address the touch pad feature at all. That was one of the main reasons I bought the camera and I still don't know how that works.,1424217600,2,268,3.9814814814814814
