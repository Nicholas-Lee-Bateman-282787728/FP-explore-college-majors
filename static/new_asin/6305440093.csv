I just got a DVD player and watched films like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver and Das Boot, which were in pristine condition. This DVD set sucks!

1029655,1,6305440093,"Of course, Kubrick is a pure genius of filmaking, and his death rings sorrow for those of us who like good, intelligent moviemaking, but he allowed a great unjustice, both to himself and to his fans, by allowing  such shoddy releases of his 7 ""master"" films. All of the films in  the set, which spans from Lolita to Full Metal Jacket, are 5-star wonders  of cinematic scope, but to view them on DVD, in thsi supposedly  ""remarkable"" set, is a let down. First off, the Dr. Strangelove  and 2001 DVD's are the same exact DVD's that have been being sold  previously before the set was released, down to the design of the disc  itself. All of the other DVD's in the set have the basic design and menu  layout, but these two, especially Dr. Strangelove, throw off the entre set  feel. Secondly, for a transfer that was supposed to be approved by Mr.  Kubrick, some of the DVD's, especially A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and  Barry Lyndon, are horribly grainy, with knicks and spots in the original  film somehow passing through the ever watching eye of perfectionist Kubrick  to the newly restored DVD. And for such a buff of technology, and an  inventor of many movie devices, I find it hard to believe he's let out  these DVD's in MONO SOUND!! It's was a tremendous disappointment when I put  in Barry Lyndon and sound only came out of 3 of my speakers! The only one  that is in Dolby Digital 5.1 is 2001, because it's the same DVd that was  released before, just in a different package. Finally, the lack of extras  really puts me off. I knew ahead of time what was packaged with these, but  it's still hard to believe that the only real ""extra"" is the  behind the scenes of the Shining. It's great, but it's the only thing,  aside from the original movie trailers, that is put on these DVD's.  Anything could have been done, news stories, BBC interivews, actor's  comments. The lack of care put toward this set is really staggering. For a  master of cinema, Kubrick really got the shaft from Warner Bros. Is there  an e-mail address or regular mailing address where normal people can  comment to Warner Bros. about their lack of effort to make these DVDs  better? It is probably the most disapointing moment for me since i've had  my DVD player.",930700800,,2246,4.531172069825437

I'm dismayed that FULL METAL JACKET and THE SHINING are in full-screen format, supposedly as the director wished. [Had he lived, might he later have  ordered widescreen editions once DVD had caught on with the masses? We'll  never know.] I distinctly remember wonderful horizontal compositions in  both films. Kubrick's trademark wide-angle dolly and Steadicam shots  definitely lose something in the translation. Therefore [the films are  phenomenal, don't get me wrong], the set gets only three stars from me.

No letterbox option?  You have got to be kidding.  Somebody should be shot.  Amazon.com advertised ""widescreen letterbox format"" for this  collection.  I guess they left out the part about THE SHINING and FULL  METAL JACKET being chopped to shreads.  I'm no expert on film, but I do  know what I like and the cinematography in THE SHINING is the best I've  ever seen bar none.  To chop off the ends of the picture so it fits my T.V.  is on a par with beheading the mona lisa so she fits in that cool new  picture frame.",930614400,,887,4.37888198757764

Full metal jacket is a great war film and the best i've seen of Vietnam. The shinning is written by Steven king. Barry Lydon is a bit long and is about someones life. A clockwork orange is a cult classic. 2001 space odyasy can be edited down to an hour but its really interesting because of the way it was filmed. Stanley Kubrick Died 666 days before Jan 1, 01 so that is really strange. Dr. Stranglove is a classic. And I loved Lolita. Stanley is one of the best directors.

1029780,5,6305440093,"Kubrick intended these movies to be full-screen (non-widescreen) for home video release. This is because Kubrick was unconventional in that he did not use a widescreen format when shooting his films. 2001 and Spartacus are the only films Kubrick shot in true widescreen format.

Yes, I know that everyone prefers the new box set that just came out this year, however, Stanley Kubrick probably would not have approved of the widescreen releases of his films, and also this set contains three films that the new set does not have. I'd rather have the bulk of Kubrick's work, and not just a sampling of it.

Everyone complained about this set when it was released to the public in 1999, apparently because most of the audio tracks were mono and not in 5.1 surround. From what I have read, Kubrick WANTED a mono sound mix - and as far as the whole aspect ratio controversy, THAT is how he wanted his films to be viewed in the first place, because that is the way that they were shot! Sure, this set skimps on EYES WIDE SHUT. However, as much as that film intrigued me, it is not what I would call his best. Some may find it essential to this set, but I could go back and forth on that one. I can always go back and purchase it seperately.

Imagine my disappointment when I discovered the lack of care and effort that went into these DVDs.  The transfers are poor and unrestored, the audio is plain old vanilla stereo, a few films are pan-and-scanned, and not a single special feature of note to be found.

1029785,3,6305440093,"I would have to agree with a lot of editorials in this section. It is a very disappointing effort. The quality of the DVD's were obviously compromised. I think the slipshod job came from a department at the studio who really didn't know who Stanley Kubrick was or maybe they just didn't like his movies! That is a possible explanation!
It looks like the studio took the transfer from a ""work print"" and they let a litter of kittens play with it on the cutting room floor before they did the transfer. (There are many artifacts, vertical scratches, blotches of unwanted color that bleed, sound dropouts, jump cuts, and other major nuisances)
Maybe the studio wanted to play one last joke on Stanley Kubrick and they decided to video tape the movies on cable TV and then do a 3rd generation transfer from that video tape; meanwhile letting the cats, dogs, kittens, racoons, and other animals play with the final tape or work print.",983318400,7,929,4.670731707317073
1029786,4,6305440093,"Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director.  I have never known a universe without Kubrick.  On the day it was released, I bought the Stanley Kubrick Collection, a box of 7 DVDs that span his entire career from Lolita to Full Metal Jacket.  Oddly enough I have never owned a single video tape or laser disc or DVD of his work.  I suppose I was waiting for the definitive collection and I thought this was it.  But I hesitate to give this box of 5 star movies a complete 5-star rating for two reasons. One is that I'm very disappointed with the packaging.  It is overly sparse and lacking in some of the extras that would enhance such a retrospective, like a booklet with rare photos, a bio of Stanley, some bits about each film and an extra CD with featurettes and interviews.  We do get the legendary making-of documentary about THE SHINING, filmed by one of Kubrick's daughters, in which we get the bizarre image of Kubrick, Jack Nicholson and Kubrick's mother sitting at the table together discussing the script.  For this short documentary alone, for the privilage of finally getting to hear the man's voice and seeing him move (he walks! he talks! he directs! he yells at Shelly Duvall!), I praise the box and encourage others to check out this rare but tragically brief glimpse into the working methods of SK.  The second reason I have for downgrading a star is that some of the prints are sloppy.  I've spotted scratches in the film, blurriness in some of the color and a lack of letter-boxing on some of the films.  I would have guessed that Kubrick, a man who hand-photographed every frame of Dr. Strangelove a few years back in order to preserve it in its original quality, would have put more care and time into the quality of the presentations in this box.  But then again, while this box was being produced, Kubrick was busy with EYES WIDE SHUT and then he passed away.
For those who are being introduced to Kubrick for the first time, this is my advice.  Take each film one at a time.  Don't rush.  Watch them in order and in between imagine waiting seven to ten years before watching the next.  Take the time to digest them.  Perhaps watch them several times each.  There is no rush.  You have the rest of your life and there will be no more new ones.  Pass these DVDs down to your grandchildren so they can understand what exactly we did when we walked the earth before them.  Be prepared to be blown away.",982886400,2,2419,4.4771689497716896
1029787,5,6305440093,"I would like to know why everyone thinks this is so horrible. I bought it recently, and I literally worship it. I love it. I especially like Dr. Strangelove. It is true that all of these DVD's are very minimalist, but that is the way Stanley Kubrick wanted them. It is true that all of the films are recorded in Mono, except for 2001, but the sound is still pretty good. It made me cry when I watched the scene in 2001 when the Pan-Am space shuttle is flying through space to the Blue Danube Waltz.

1029848,3,6305440093,"5 stars for the movies, 1 star for the DVDs.
Kubrick is my favorite director and he made some of my alltime favorite movies including Strangelove, 2001, and Clockwork Orange.  Definitely see these movies (several play almost yearly in some theaters), but I highly suggest viewing (renting) at least some of the DVDs before buying this box set.
These are among worst quality DVDs, I have purchased.  Maybe it's becuase I work with digital video and notice these flaws more than others, but still the problems with the quality is significant and you must be warned.  These could be great and they are not.
They are bad not because the older films are all mono and not widescreen.  And it's not due to the lack of extras, although I personally would enjoy several commentaries for each.  It's that there are quality issues which had these DVDs been done properly would not be there.  These films were not digitally re-mastered or restored, rather they are 3rd generation copies digitized/encoded from the analog D-1 video masters (made from the films) and it shows.  As a result the DVDs are filled with every example of bad MPEG encoding - color banding, moires, mesquito-ing, draping, etc.  For example, in 2001, starfields jitter and jump, at times the blackness of space has ugly chunks and stripes of draping, jittering black mud, the smooth gradients of the sunrise were turned into an ugly sequence of color-by-numbers quality color banding, just to name a few.
None of this is in the original of course, and most of this wouldn't show up in viewing of the analog laser disc.  Some of the bad MPEG artifacting could have been avoiding with just smarter encoding software that made better choices about palettes and keyframes.  Nonetheless, they should fully restore/remaster these digitally for DVD to match the original intended theatrically experience as much as possible (relative to DVD format).
That's not to say all the mono should be remastered into an artificial 5.1, but at least do basic clean up and set the levels properly and if a stereo source was mastered to mono for theaters consider doing it in stereo.  (I know it's minor, but how could someone let audio like that one the Clark speech extra on the 2001 DVD be that bad?).  Digitally remove scratches, and repair damage to video, etc
We can only hope that the Estate of Kubrick decides to do these right.  These are great films and they deserve better.",974592000,19,2425,4.814457831325301
1029849,5,6305440093,"This is the best ox set on the market for anny Kubrick fan like myself. The box set includes Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb, A Clockwork Orange, The Shinning, Full Metal Jacket, 2001 A Space Oddissy, Barry Lyndon, and Lolita. The dvd's themselves don't have a overwelming amount of special features other than the theatrical trailer. On the other hand the shinning has a very good behind the scenes documentary about the making of the film.

Not when you consider that Stanley Kubrick has been one of the finest directors and his movies are some of the very best made.
Making history with these movies covering the best of his career films from 1961 to 1987, you just can't go wrong.
The power that these movies carry is inspiring.

If you enjoy movies, this collosal gathering is the best I've found.

1029851,5,6305440093,I saw this collection recently and in my opinion they are 7 of the best films of all time. Don't worry about the mediocre quality of the discs because the excellent films outweigh the problems. My personel favourite is  A Clockwork Orange but although it has more taegs than any of the other  films they are all well worth watching.,963964800,5,332,4.516666666666667
1029852,4,6305440093,"Ok first of all this is worth buying and has Kubrick's classics. Kubrick is my favorite director. I have watched every one of his films and have studied his films since I first got into film. This collection is all of  his mainstream and most famous work. From ""A Clockwork Orange"" to  ""Full Metal Jacket"".
  However I would have loved to see his  other works on this collection. Not a complete works collection but a  variety of everything. They should have added his first full-length feature  ""Killer's Kiss"" to show how the master went from a simple  film-noir thriller to an epic like ""2001"". This also should've  had Kubrick's early war classic ""Paths Of Glory"" which is  underrated and overseen on Kubrick's films and War films. It has a powerful  message and is as glorius as the films in this collection. ""Eyes Wide  Shut"" could've been added but its not an essential( anyways the snobs  would've complained and wouldn't buy it).
  Anyways I'm not going to  give this collection a bad rating and scream and shout forever about it  because simply this collection still has some of the best films ever made  on it and is worth buying anyday. Try to get it on DVD if you can.",962668800,,1181,4.596153846153846
1029853,4,6305440093,"I recently bought this box set and I cant quite understand all the criticism it has received here.  I have fairly good TV with s-video and a barely one month old dvd player.  After reading the reviews here I was  afraid to put these movies into my player, from fear that it may explode or  something!  I have watched all of the videos, some of which while viewing I  asked my girlfriend, ""whats so terrible about this?""  She couldn't  figure it out either!  The picture is a hundred times better than VHS. Keep  in mind that only Full Metal Jacket was filmed in the 80's...of course the  rest are not going to be up to the standards of today's films.  Kubrick  films never were good money makers (unfortunately)  so of course you're not  going to see WB shelling out money for THX re-masters.  Another thing  people complained about was sound.  Kubrick only filmed one movie (eyes  wide shut) in stereo.  2001 and Spartacus were re-mastered for stereo years  later.  He wanted the movies in mono, why cant people understand that?  Just because you own a $3000 sound system , that doesnt necissarily mean  that we should alter a director's vision just so you can here a few extra  bullets and music.  I would not want these films in anything BUT mono.  Anyone familiar with the remixing of the Beach Boys Pet Sounds album into  stereo is witness to how awful the results of stereo remixing can be.  Unless you have HDTV or some space age technology that can expose flaws in  anything, don't be afraid to buy this set.  I am not disappointed at all.  And come on folks, the transfer on Barry Lyndon isn't THAT bad (you really  think this movie that bombed in the US will ever get a THX remaster?  No  way...though it may deserve it, it all comes down to $).  Only complaint  with the set is that Dr. Strangelove is advertised on the back of the box  as a multi-aspect widescreen edition, when in fact it is pan and scan.  If  that bothers you, buy them seperate, but they are not as horrible as  everyone says...and I am a VERY fussy viewer and life long Kubrick fan.",955843200,104,2065,4.443548387096774

Even though he is the 'bad guy' in this movie, he is  still so likeable. Peter Sellers is also wonderful in Dr. Strangelove.

As my TV does not have an S video connection and I'm running the connection through an RF modulator,  I'm probably not getting the best picture quality. Obviously I'm no video  purist, still, I'm glad to have the collection. But I do wonder if Warner  Bros. plans a DVD re-release of these films at some later date in more  pristine condition. Some of the prints do look washed out. I have a feeling  the Kubrick collection may have been rushed to market to capitialize on  EWS, and complete care may not have been taken - this in spite the claims  that Kubrick gave this collection his seal of approval. More likely Kubrick  gave his approval to a marketing scheme that would allow gradually improved  versions. But these are old films - We must remind ourselves that  ""Clockwork Orange"" is almost thirty years old now - a bit of a  shock to think about.

1029900,5,6305440093,"I read a number of reviews of the DVD release of thiscollection after I bought it, and feared the worst.  Having onlyperused the discs, my review is premature at best, but I do want to share my views on what I saw.  First off, the sound is better than I expected it would be.  The mono mastering is actually quite good, and I found little difference between the 2001 disc (which is in 5.1 stereo) and the others, except that it was louder.  I should say that I am viewing these with a stereo reciever, and not a surround sound system, which I imagine will account for much of the difference. Second, I found the video quality to be quite satisfactory, in fact, I was really happy to see the colors the way they should be (the brights aren't distorted on Clockwork Orange as it is on VHS).  Most of these movies are over twenty years old, and I think some of graininess (ie, on Barry Lyndon) is due to superior mastering of older film.  From someone coming from VHS, all I can say is that the picture is beautiful.  It looks like FILM, not TV.  The formatting and supplemental material controversy is overblown.  Kubrick rarely shot in real widescreen, so we ARE getting the whole image he shot.  And while Kubrick commentary would be wonderful, I won't hold it against him if it isn't there.  While personally, I would love to have all these movies in 5.1 stereo (and if there are better prints of the film or superior mastering techniques--which I doubt--it would be nice to have those too I guess), I have no problem with the transfers.  In fact, they are what I have been wishing for all these years, stuck with clunky, sloppy VHS tapes.  Since these masters are appoved by THE master, any complaints should be taken up with him, I guess, and I'm not about to do that.  Besides, any technical flaws I can't even detect are more than made up for by the ARTISTIC quality of these discs.  The movies look and sound great.  These DVDs bring the home viewer closer to Kubrick's vision than ever before, and for that reason, I recommend this collection without reservation.",948153600,,2070,4.494652406417113
1029901,5,6305440093,"I have just finished watching through the last DVD in the Kubric Collection and aside from Barry Lyndon found all of the conversions to DVD to be wonderful. I don't see any signs of ""bugs flying across the  screen"" or any kinds of ""washed out colors"" either... except  of course on Barry Lyndon which was already ""washed out"" in  theatres. The digital quality on these DVDs are certainly as good as any  other DVD on the shelf and is _definately_ better quality than anything you  can pick up off the VHS shelf. Of course I understand many peoples' views  on Kubric's decision for The Shining and Full Metal Jacket to be  re-mastered in pan & scan, but what I don't understand is how you  people can sit here and hail Kubric as being one of your favorite directors  and a complete genius and at the same time completely criticize his wishes  he made in his final time with us. They are wonderful movies and it would  be nice to see them in pan & scan, but the reality is that unless MGM  decides one day that they don't respect Kubric's vision anymore and that  they are going to do what they jolly well please and make those movies in  widescreen, then pan & scan is what you they will make, and pan &  scan is what you will get. Just quit your griping and sit back and watch  movies from a legend.",946252800,10,1299,4.305785123966942
1029902,5,6305440093,"Well, here's your chance to find out. First off, you have to deal with the fact that these DVD's are as good a presentation as you're ever going to get. Most of his films were released in Mono, and many in matted formats,  which means that when they're presented on TV, you don't get the black bars  at the top and bottom. Complaints about this last bit are meaningless, as  2001 was his only film released in scope, and the ones that would really  need it -- Lolita and Barry Lyndon included -- are released in widescreen.  Kubrick deliberately shot The Shining and Full Metal Jacket in 1:1.37 for  masking in the theatres and because he couldn't have forseen the  letterboxing craze we're currently in. Many directors chose to release  films not in widescreen because of this (read any one of the biographies  for this info). So, what you're left with are seven of the greatest films  ever made, and released on DVD for a relatively cheap price. How can you  pass this up? Kubrick's view of the universe is dark, totally Hegellian,  and sometimes too depressing for the average viewer. But, those who venture  into the unknown presented within his films are rewarded with a series of  brilliant images that resonate symbolically in ways very few directors  could ever hope to achieve. Renoir, Welles, Kurosawa, Ozu, Tarkovsky --  these are the acknowledged masters. Add Kubrick to the pantheon. Nothing  will ever equal the experience of seeing 2001 in a theatre, but this is as  close as you'll get -- and it is in widescreen and 5.1 Dolby.",945907200,37,1543,4.6940298507462686
1029903,2,6305440093,"Format debate aside, the transfer is horrible. Grainy, bad sound mixing, washed out color in the color pictures. It's worth waiting until someone who loved these wonderful films decides to put together DVDs worthy of the  films on them.",945302400,19,236,5.051282051282051
1030070,5,6305440093,"Again Warner Bros. proves that they understand what it is to release quality films on quality DVDs. This is an absolute must have for any fan of the greatest filmmaker ever.
First of all they release the movies in  snap cases which are way better than the keep cases that strangely enough,  everybody seems to like?  Keep cases look cheap and the disc holders  are difficult to manipulate... Truly badly designed cases. Unfortunately  Warners seems to be the only ones who uses snap cases, the others just  didn't understand, that's a shame.
Anyhow, all the other criticisms this  box set is recieving are not justified. The format in which the films are  presented is exactly how Kubrick wanted it. So nothing to get all excited  here.(Read the intro from Amazon! )
Same thing for the extras, it was  all approved by the late filmmaker and there were not many available  anyway. And The making of The Shining alone, is worth the price of this  set. It is simply memorable to see this rare documentary of the master at  work. By the way this special collection was prepared many months before  Kubrick died and all work on the box set was already completed as well.  Aside from audio commentaries that were planned for Full Metal Jacket, but  they were dropped anyway, before he passed.
I agree though that a booklet  would have been a good addition to the set, but it seems that this belongs  to the good old Laser Discs now... Since they are rarely seen in any DVD  release these days.
As for the transfer, it's true that some artifacts  can be seen here and there (mainly on Barry Lyndon), but on a good machine,  they are not really distracting.
I would recommand this collection to all  Kubrick fans, you won't be disapointed. This is without a doubt the best  way to experience these masterpieces at home anyway.
It's great news that  Eyes Wide Shut (non-edited), will be available on DVD, on March 7th and  A.I. will officialy be made by Steven Spielberg, based on the treatment by  Kubrick!",944870400,16,1998,4.637142857142857

 This is the best collection of movies probably ever  made from with out a doudth the best director ever, and these films are  shown in the way that the Kubrick (God) wanted and there fore if you do not  appreciate the formatting go buy some popcorn movies or go and watch barny  I'm sure you would be happier.",943660800,13,553,4.425742574257426

1030073,5,6305440093,"I finally bought this collection after some wariness from reading all these posts.  Then I did some research about the films on the IMDB. The films that people are complaining about as being Pan & Scan are nothing  of the sort. The original negative ratio of the films is 1.37:1 which is  APPROXIMATELY the same as the aspect ratio of your TV set.  The films were  matted on the top and bottom slightly to give a theatrical ratio of 1.66:1  .  For home release these films were left open matted which may  be full  screen but it is hardly pan & scan. I think these films look rather  good, a couple of specks here and there through the Shining but hardly  anything distracting...no problem with the sound being mono...that's how  they were filmed, that's how kubrick wanted them. It's  interesting how  viewers who want to see the movie the way the director intended it are  always so eager to modify that vision when it suits them.
All in all a  great set for a tremendous kubrick fan.  Some more extras would have been  nice but for $69.00 shipped, I'm hardly complaining;)",938995200,65,1075,4.539267015706806
1030115,1,6305440093,"Sure, Full Metal Jacket and Shining are okay on a SMALL, 1x44 television, but if you own a widescreen HDTV, which enhances the aspects that DVD has to offer, the movies fall FAR SHORT of what DVD has to offer.  If you are  not a movie connieseur, go ahead and buy this collection, but if you bought  your dvd player for higher quality, DEMAND that higher quality.  Otherwise,  keep buying VHS movies.  When you get your first 35"" or larger tv,  then post how wonderful the movies are visually, and when you have a DTS  decoder with 5.1 surround speakers, then say how wonderful the audio is,  but the simple fact is, on smaller tv's using the audio directly from the  tv or using simple stereo, you really won't notice how BAD these transfers  are (except for the Shining which is HIDEOUS.  Burn marks in the film,  jumping, jitter...ugh...enough to send me to an early grave).  IF I could  return my set, I would.  They are that bad.

The press releases and news clips you are reading on DVD sales  sites about the ""unprecedented"" quality of this set is typical,  vile, corporate spin control.  Ask any editor of an independent DVD review  site and he will tell you he was denied a review copy of the set until  after its release.

7889398,5,6305440093,"Stanley Kubrick is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of all time, and this collection is certainly a treasure, if you want to see Kubrick's films the way he envisioned them. From ""Lolita"" to ""Full Metal Jacket"", this collection is filled with marvelous films with amazing acting, cinematography, direction, you name it!

  Lolita (1962)- 10/10- Based on the controversial Vladimir Nabokov novel from the 50's, this Stanley Kubrick film adaptation had to be toned down to fit the standards of the MPAA, but the result is still a brilliant masterpiece. It's about a British man named Humbert Humbert (James Mason), who moves to Ramsdale, New Hampshire and stays in the house of a very neurotic woman named Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters), along with her 14-year old daughter, Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze (Sue Lyon). Humbert suddenly becomes infatuated with Lolita and marries Charlotte to be with her. But there's some trouble along the way. This film has great performances from James Mason, Shelley Winters, Sue Lyon, and Peter Sellers, in his many disguises, which is similar to his role in Kubrick's next film, ""Dr. Strangelove"". It also has a fantastic screenplay, written by Nabokov himself, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, an excellent pace, and also an amazing theme song, ""Lolita Ya Ya"". The only special features are the theatrical trailer and production notes. ""Lolita"" is an excellent achievement in Stanley Kubrick's career.

  Dr. Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)- 9.5/10- ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"" Stanley Kubrick soared to new heights with this outrageous war comedy that certainly deserves to be called a masterpiece. When General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) declares a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, this sparks chaos as Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers), tries to stop him. Meanwhile, in the War Room at the Pentagon, they also are discussing plans to stop him, thinking it will start a huge war. If the attack happens, a Doomsday Machine sets off, which would bomb the whole world in a series of explosions. It's a crazy and fun black comedy with outstanding performances from Peter Sellers as three characters (Captain Mandrake, President Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove), George C. Scott (General Buck Turgisdon), Sterling Hayden (Jack D. Ripper), and many more. It's a film to watch over and over and appreciate the gorgeous black-and-white, the aspect-ratio changing, the performances, the comedy, and, of course, the ending. There are no special features on this disc. Altogether, ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a must-see!

  2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)- 10/10- Certainly one of my favorite Kubrick films, one of his best films, and one of the best films of all time. ""2001"" is about human life and technology in a complex plot divided into 4 sections that can't certainly be explained without telling each part of it, but it's about the dangers of technology, mankind's future, and many other though-provoking questions. Your mind will definitely run wild at the slow-paced but brilliant film. It has some of the best cinematography and effects I've ever seen, including the famous ""Stargate"" sequence, which freaked me out when I first saw it. Another amazing thing about the film is the lack of dialouge. There less than 45 minutes dialogue in a 2 1/2 hour film, but it's supposed to show you the beauty of what's on screen, rather than what the characters are saying. One of my favorite things in a Kubrick movie is the music, and it doesn't get any better than this, with it's famous use of Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" and Johann Strauss' ""The Blue Danube"", along with ""Gayaneh Ballet Suite"" from Aram Khachaturyan and multiple haunting songs from Gyorgy Ligeti. The special features are an interview with Arthur C. Clarke, the person who wrote ""The Sentinel"" in which the film is based off of. There's also a few trailers. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a haunting, beautiful, and unforgettable movie and certainly the best sci-fi of all time (it even inspired Star Wars). ""Open the pod bay doors, HAL.""

  Barry Lyndon (1975)- 10/10- A breathtaking masterpiece that is very underrated and is one of his best films. Martin Scorsese said it was his favorite Kubrick film, and I can see why. It's 3 hours of gorgeous, painting-like shots, and many other amazing things. It's about a 17th century rogue named Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), who works his way up to wealth and fortune when he marries Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). It's full of drama and intrigue and every shot in the film is beautiful. It has some of Stanley Kubrick's best cinematography, done by John Alcott. The music is also a stand-out using Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, and many other amazing Baroque composers. The special features include the theatrical trailer and production notes. It's a Stanley Kubrick film not to miss.

  The Shining (1980)- 10/10- Words literally can't describe how much I love ""The Shining"". It's by far one of my favorite films, my favorite horror film (next to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho""), my all-time favorite Stanley Kubrick film, and one of the best horror films ever made! From the haunting opening credits to the last shot of the film, ""The Shining"" is a macabre masterpiece, based on the brilliant Stephen King novel from '77. It's about a man named Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), a recovering alcoholic who becomes the winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel, along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley Duvall), and Danny (Danny Lloyd), who has a psychic ability called ""the shining"", where he later communicates with the head chef of the Overlook, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers). The Overlook Hotel is known for it's tragic events in the past, and later on, Danny starts seeing ghosts from the hotel and eventually, Jack is drove to murderous rage, and tries to kill his family. The film has a very slow pace (it's 2 1//2 hours), but the slow pace really drives the eerie feeling over the edge until the suspense is unbearable. It's certainly one of the scariest films of all time. The film has, in my opinion, the greatest music compositions ever in a Kubrick film. It includes music from Krzysztof Penderecki, Gyorgy Ligeti, Bela Bartok, and some great 30's music, altogether adding up the suspense and making the film even better, especially with it's use of ""Polymorphia"" by Penderecki. It's definitely my favorite composition of all time and it's absolute perfection in the movie, playing during my favorite scene in the movie, where Shelley Duvall finally realizes how crazy her husband is through a series of papers. Another amazing thing about the movie is the acting. About every actor is this film does amazing, including Jack Nicholson (in a signature role), Shelley Duvall (who looks extremely hot in this film), and Danny Lloyd. This film is perfect, from the performances, music, cinematography, Steadicam use, color, and multiple ambiguities which have you thinking for days and days. The special features include the amazing half-hour documentary ""The Making of The Shining"", where Kubrick's daughter, Vivian, records all of the actors on the set, along with the brilliant theatrical trailer. It's a haunting, disturbing, and amazing film.

  Full Metal Jacket (1987)- 9.5/10- Not his best, but definitely not his worst. Stanley Kubrick portrays the hells of war in a brilliant way. It takes place during the Vietnam War, where many characters (Matthew Modine, Arliss Howard, Vincent D'Onofrio, and many others) are put through boot camp and war. The first hour is boot camp and the second hour is a bunch of war sequences which are pretty intense. the boot camp scenes stand out so much because of R. Lee Ermey's performance as Sergeant Hartman, with his witty lines and foul-mouthed language. It makes the first half all the more enjoyable. The use of 60's music is also a nice touch, along with a great opening hair-cut montage, and brilliant cinematography. The special features include the theatrical trailer. Altogether, it's a fantastic Stanley Kubrick film.

  ""The Stanley Kubrick Collection"" is a wonderful 7-movie set that includes some of the best films of all time. With this set, you could see the true genius of Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999). Cinema will definitely never be the same without him.
