8546775,1,B00A4Y6272,"Quite possibly the worst National Geographic production ever released. It's a total rip-off! Some dude dressed in black leather tours e edges of the Palmdale secret projects bases of Skunkworks, Dreamworks and Plant 41. You see zero secret aircraft. He does go to a local bar and talk to people about secret aircraft, Some mystery dude gives him pictures of something inside Plant 41 but it could have been a water heater or a secret project work space. The pumped up drama by the pathetic dude from Popular Science is just plane hokey! I'd like a refund  but the accompanying film about Rosewell is pretty good. I saw the ad for ""Top Secret Plant 42"" on the leader of another National Geographic DVD. I thought it would be National Geographic quality but it was a real flop. Save your bucks, don't buy the dog of  production...",1449100800,,828,4.664383561643835
8546776,1,B00A4Y6272,"I was expecting a factual documentary on the order of Modern Marvels about all the cool aircraft that has been developed at Plant 42.  Instead it was more on the order of Monster Quest.  It was all about the host's attempts to prove his own childish fantasies about the conspiratorial and sinister nature of Plant 42.  He goes on and on about his ridiculous delusion that his life is in danger for even inquiring about Plant 42.  Although he and his film crew were graciously granted access and tours by three different agencies in Plant 42, he chose to hardly show any footage from that, instead preferring the drunken opinions of patrons in a little out of town bar.  Plant 42 is in the Palmdale/Lancaster community, which has a combined population of over 300,000 between the two cities.  This show hilariously claims that Plant 42 is out in the middle of the unexplored wilderness with only a few crazy desert rats anywhere around.  They are very careful to show him driving on dirt roads and driving by a rundown gas station with tumbleweeds blowing by.  The gas station, of course, is not anywhere near Palmdale and Plant 42.  Someone offers to meet him at the well-known and well-attended flight watching area at Avenue N & Sierra Hwy.  The host again acts like it is some conspiracy where either a crazy local or a government agent is plotting to lure him to a remote location to assassinate him.  And on and on it goes.  This ""documentary"" is a disgrace.  I can't believe National Geographic wasn't embarrassed to put out such cartoonish rot.",1422748800,,1551,4.678966789667896

I am perplexed as to why National Geographic would attach their name to this show. Tremendous amounts of time are spent filming Mr. Ward acting amazed that they will not allow him to film where ever he pleases, dramatic setup shots of locations, and driving. One scene in a dark room, lit only by an overly bright desk pointed at a wall where Mr. Ward was taping pictures that he probably cut out of Popular Science's archives would have been better suited for a SyFy channel monster movie than a documentary. Of course this show would not be a releasing ""new"" top secret information, but it didn't contain much in the way of aircraft information at all. A few factual tidbits about the SR-71 and B-2, and a three minute discussion about the new computer controlled drone were the extent of the aviation information.

Mr. Ward's commentary suggests he is either not qualified to host aviation shows or had no control of the script. One gem near the beginning, along the lines of, ""look at the size of those hangers there could be any type of aircraft behind those doors"" set the tone for the rest of the show.

Avoid this at all cost, anyone with even a casual interest in aircraft will be bored and frustrated by the overly dramatic nature of this stinker!",1360627200,4,1384,4.554216867469879
