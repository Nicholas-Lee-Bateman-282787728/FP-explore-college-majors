7158543,5,B00X59E4BY,"Both the Dora and Bubble Guppy are brand new you us and great!  I like the variety and getting to experience a single episode of something new, without investing in a full dvd.  We do not have cable and the kids watch exclusively PBS and DVDs that I approve.  Kids are 2 & 3:)",1447632000,,276,4.074074074074074

8715033,4,B00X59E4BY,"I think learning the importance of Kindness is easier when it's taught by a child's favorite characters. I mostly purchased this for my 4 year old because of the variety of favorite characters and shows, but the subject of kindness is an added bonus. We instill kindness in our children from a young age, but sometimes it's home a little easier when they are seeing their favorite characters on the screen displaying kindness.",1483574400,3,426,4.8493150684931505

8715035,5,B00X59E4BY,"Very cute and perfect for my almost 3 and almost 4 yr olds. Less advanced than the 123, ABC, and Colors DVD. This has cuter shows than I usually see from these series. Dragon-Princess theme for Dora and Bubble Guppies. Probably the least annoying toddler DVD I've purchased, and my oldest is 16! Super cute coloring page on the back of DVD insert page.",1477440000,3,352,4.515625
