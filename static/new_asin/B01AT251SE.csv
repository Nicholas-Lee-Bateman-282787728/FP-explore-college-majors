7608180,5,B01AT251SE,"Having faithfully watched the original 4 seasons of Heroes, warts and all, I'm painfully aware of what those warts were. Nevertheless, I never lost my love for the original series run, and Heroes Reborn, while not perfect, is a breath of fresh air, and a pleasant chance to be reunited with old faces and introduced to new blood, while countering ugly developments since 2010, said developments being the xenophobic backlash against a now-absent Claire Bennett's bold, dramatic gut decision in the series finale.

And Claire's very absence is what drives the plot of this miniseries; whether one loved or disliked her, she cast a long shadow over the series, and was--for better or worse--the face of the show, whose very survival was needed to ""Save the world,"" as the oft-repeated mantra goes. Which begs the question: In a world where Claire can no longer be ""saved,"" who steps up to the plate to ""save the world"" from a (seemingly-unstoppable) cosmic menace? Also, as Claire was near-indestructible, it goes without saying that anything that could permanently remove her from the world of the living is worth the DVD binge-viewing time one should set aside to discovering what silenced her--and how. No spoilers.

Some of the original cast have returned, but their lives and fortunes haven't necessarily improved in the years since the world was changed. Some are broken shells, haunted by personal demons and unresolved regrets (Noah Bennett, Matt Parkman), either driving them to heroism or darkness. Angela Petrelli is a modern Cassandra, warning of apocalypse, but greeted with doubt, due to her machinations in the past. Children from the original run are now adults raging against their elders whose actions may doom the future: Molly Walker, her Cerebro-like powers making her a target of those wishing to exploit said talents in a manner similar to Project Insight in Captain America-The Winter Soldier, and Micah Sanders' mind-over-machine cyber-truther acts in the Heroes Reborn mini-episodes (before he's compromised) are reminiscent of his ""Rebel"" persona in Season 3. Hiro Nakamura is no less heroic than in years past, but is imprisoned to prevent said heroism, Mohinder's reputation is cast into doubt, demonized in the public eye, and Rene of Haiti has cryptically erased critical parts of Noah's memories from a year ago--on Noah's own orders. (The fates of Peter Petrelli and Sylar are not revealed.)

The new faces introduced here include: Frustrated, confused Evo teens Malina and Tommy (their true pasts hidden, while being told that they are destined for greater things), Luke and Joanne, a grieving couple whose loss of their child to terror compels them to engage in a killing spree against Evos (before a discovery casting doubt on their actions), former Afghan war veteran Carlos Gutierrez of L.A., assuming the costumed role of his dead Evo brother (a local legend who was a cross between a luchador and the 2010 film hero, Kick-Ass), Ren Shimosawa and the cyberspace ""Katana Girl"" of Japan (the former possessing an infectious, adventurous charm, the latter having a tragic flesh-and-blood origin), the ruthless CEO Erika Kravid (and her estranged daughter, Taylor), whose amoral, utopian preparations to select a chosen few for a post-cataclysm world make her quite unlikable (until a flashback late in the series--while not excusing her actions--makes her more sympathetic), and a fedora-clad Caspar, making one's worst problems disappear with a coin toss. There's more, but out of courtesy, I'll let those who have yet to see the series discover it for themselves.

The specter of a fearful world that feels the need to criminalize/police superhuman activity, while not original--having been explored earlier in Alan Moore's Watchmen, The Incredibles, X-Men, and Marvel Comics' 2006-7 Civil War crossover--is still compelling TV drama, even as it becomes obvious that the worst offenses attributed to evolved beings may not be what they seem to be; the 2014 Odessa terror attack (and its alleged perpetrator) has disturbing parallels with the climax to the 1999 film, Arlington Road.

The disproportionate contempt heaped on it by critics trying to bury it in the pop culture dustbin of history, notwithstanding, it was worth my time, its bittersweet, tear-jerker of a resolution (followed by a new mystery rearing its head) making it obvious that the younger cast members were meant to represent the passing of the series' torch to a new generation, something which--absent exploration in graphic novel or comic form--may not be examined onscreen any time soon. That said, it's still worth discovering for yourselves.",1456617600,9,4653,5.240268456375839
7608181,3,B01AT251SE,"I've been a fan of Heroes for years and own Seasons 1-4 but I can't buy Heroes Reborn- NOT AT THIS PRICE. 13 episodes for almost $50, I think $30 would be reasonable blu ray release, but I will not pay almost $50 for this.",1456358400,3,222,3.9555555555555557
7608182,4,B01AT251SE,"While this was not quite the reboot longtime Heroes fans were hoping for, I think they did a pretty good job given what they had.  Few things are ever going to live up to that golden first season of the original show, but this is better than the third and fourth seasons, and maybe the second one too.  They brought back as many characters as they could, Matt Parkman, Micha Sanders, Hiro for a little bit, I wish he had a bit of a bigger role, but while his part is small, the impact does effect the series/timeline quite a bit.  And most importantly Noah Benent, he ties almost everything together, even though he's not really in the last three episodes except during the very end.  I'm sure this would have been all the better if they could have had everybody come back and have this revolve around most of the main characters from the original show, but they were able to tell a new story that's only a little bit of a rehash of a lot of the first show, a lot of the new characters are interesting, my favorite was Katana Girl, I liked the going inside a video game angle.  This had a lot of potential, but the finished product was just not as good, it's a shame this was canned, but the original series was a huge part of what made the superhero genre TV shows so popular now, and with the likes of The Flash and Arrow and Gotham on right now, was this slightly watered down version of one of the best superhero shows ever, outclassed?  This is worth a watch, but I say don't expect a whole lot from it, and whatever you do, do not compare it in any way to the original.  And wait until it drops in price significantly.",1454457600,3,1624,4.236245954692556

7608184,3,B01AT251SE,"A reboot worth watching to end the full series. You get answers about some of the characters (and if you are smart enough and do not need to be spoon fed, you can deduce the end of other characters). This event series had a bit too much shine and shimmer for me. There were a lot of bold colors and a line of clean lines, which screams CGI and not reality. Green screen is rather obvious and used a lot. Abilities and characters are rather superficial. It definitely felt like there has been five years between the resurgence. The directing style is very different, too. A lot of on characters as opposed to the shadowing on faces for dramatic affect. I did enjoy the event series as it was, and will add it to my Heroes continuum. But, it needed some more work and a better eye and ear on several things...those being Plot, Character Development, Acting, Effects. Heroes came in as a bonfire, left as a puff of smoke and came back as a tea-light candle. If they are going to bring it back another time, they really need to look at season 1 of Heroes.",1453680000,6,1051,4.340101522842639
7608185,5,B01AT251SE,I love Heroes Reborn!!!!!!!!! I watch it on TV anytime it airs. Though It leaves me with questions you really have to love it!,1453334400,2,126,4.291666666666667
7608186,5,B01AT251SE,"Heroes Reborn is actually a very strong re-boot
Anyone who still hasn't given it a chance mostly due to any word of mouth online (Don't trust any major negative reviews or nitpicking of this Mini series) The problem with the internet most people are usually very untruthful everyone has to be the edgy hipster that's to cool for the room
You might be thinking why should i listen to your review
I'm not hiding behind some fake screen name and I don't need to be edgy I'm very cynical/negative when it comes to good tv series
but, this series is actually very enjoyable for a stand alone re-boot
This is the type of mini series you have to actually watch and decide if you enjoy it or not
It's not perfect I'll openly admit that but, it has the spirit of season one
The story is told much like season one (by the time you get to the 7 episodes almost everything adds up
There's plenty of cool payoffs almost all the new cast really fit into the Heroes universe
NBC did a terrible job pushing these new characters in my opinion before the shows even aired
On paper most of them look generic/cheap but, none of them actually are almost all of them are extremely layered

New cast
Zachary Levi  (Luke Collins) This is a project where Levi gets to show of his acting range
He's not at all what you think
Robbie Kay  (Tommy Clark) the kid carries a lot of this mini series he's does a great job
Kiki Sukezane  (Miko Otomo) Kiki is very good she is a character you really don't get enough of
Ryan Guzman  (Carlos Gutierrez) One of the very few humans his character is in many ways a rip-off of Batman/The Punisher but, it makes sense and works
Danika Yarosh  (Malina Bennet) She does get nearly enough screen time she is what Claire Bennet should have been in the original season
She is likable and more grounded in reality
Aislinn Paul  (Phoebe Frady) Before Reborn hit the airways NBC put out Heroes Reborn: Dark Matters which was meant to bridge the gap between the original series and Reborn you also get a massive back-story to Phoebe before she became a monster
Dark Matter is included with this blu ray set
Rya Kihlstedt  (Erica Kravid ) Erica Kravid is meant to be these series main villain she is actually very good but, some of the build up coming to destroy the planet is a little cheap
Gatlin Green  (Emily Duval) Tommy's new girlfriend
Henry Zebrowski  (Quentin Frady) He is very good until the past is changed then he changes
Judith Shekoni  (Joanne Collins)  Luke's wife very good actress at first you don't understand her motives and why she does what she does but, after you see the aftermath of Odessa, Texas you'll pretty much understand why she is so broken
Will you agree with her actions probably not
Krista Bridges  (Anne Clark) Tommy's mother who is on the run with her son
Toru Uchikado  ( Ren Shimosawa) Toru is fun to watch he has a much bigger purpose in the story overall
Cl Bennett  (Harris Prime) In many ways he's meant to be the new version of Sylar but, more of a cooperate hit man
He a interesting bad guy but, you never get any real back-story to him which is a shame
Eve Harlow  (Taylor Kravid)  Erica Kravid black sheep daughter she has a surprisingly good story arc
Nazneen Contractor  ( Farah Nazan)
Hiro Kanagawa  ( Hachiro Otomo) Great actor he's done everything!
Pruitt Taylor Vince  (Casper Abraham) Great new Hero with a very cool power he can make anyone forget whatever he wants with a penny

Returning Cast Members
Sendhil Ramamurthy  (Mohinder Suresh) you don't get enough of him he makes pop in cameos
Greg Grunberg  (Matt Parkman) This isn't the by the book good cop Matt Parkman he's sold his soul for power
Noah Gray-Cabey  (Micah Sanders) Micah all grown up he has a small cameo
Masi Oka  ( Hiro Nakamura) very small cameo I'm shocked he was even able to work for a different network since he's on a full time CBS series
Jack Coleman  (Noah Bennet) He is the only original member that is in almost the entire mini series
This Noah Bennet isn't the same guy at all time has changed him

The biggest thing you should now going into this it takes place a year after a massive tragic event in Odessa, Texas
Much like a Sept 11
The series at first makes no real sense but, by the time you get to episode 5 lots of story elements come together
There's a lot of good interesting pay offs
On the surface it's a mystery but, everything goes much deeper then that
Do you have to be a fan of the original series to like or get into this mini series without a doubt no
It's written for new and old fans alike

The biggest problem i have with this blu ray set is lack of any cool special features like a cast/writers audio commentary track
But, this is the type of series you have to go back and view a couple more times for everything to click  9/10",1453248000,13,4784,4.3861834654586636

7608196,5,B01AT251SE,"Regarding the Blu-ray -- the menus could be a bit better (seem hastily put together), but they work I forgive them because this show is so amazingly epic! Also, I'm getting a single season show on Blu-ray so that I can watch it whenever I want, so I can't complain.

Spoilers follow... FYI

I have never seen the original Heroes series. My lil bro came home one day talking about some save the cheerleader, save the world crap hed heard a friend mention at school, and we both made fun of it for five minutes. That was the extent of my exposure to Heroes. But the trailer for this looked good, and I was in need of a new TV show to watch this September so what the heck.

I loved it. I felt like a kid reading Harry Potter. Watching these characters wake up to their powers gave me an adrenaline rush you don't see on TV much anymore. The multitude of storylines never bored or confused me, and the pacing was just right to give me tiny clues, but not too much. And when the big reveal did happen EPIC!

The framing device of Noah losing his memories could get frustrating at times, and I knew there would be no valid explanation for it. It was plot device, and Id have to accept the stupidity of the reason once it was revealed. Wrong! The explanation made SO much sense, and it blew my mind. I seriously think June 13th Part I is the best hour of TV Ive ever seen.

One theme I loved was the fear and marginalization of the Evos for being different. Sure, I get that people are afraid of randos with crazy powers, but the extreme, government-sponsored discrimination showed how far the mob is willing to take things. The heroes are trying to save the world and Erica is stopping them because, well, shes a bigot. I think some people can overlook their prejudices in everyday life, and Heroes Reborn is a good allegory that can open their eyes. I almost think it should be required viewing but I digress

Diversity was another big contributor. Some shows shoehorn it in with characters from races A, B, and C. Okay, we got all three? Perfect, quota met. This show didn't have diversity for inclusive purposes, the concept is that Evos are everywhere around the world. It was truly a diverse show. Heroes Reborn didn't have a diverse cast to win an Emmy, they did it because the story needed it. Thats kind of diversity/casting/story I like to see. Meaningful, purposeful, and not abusive or marginalizing.

Speaking of the cast (and the writing), it was great. The acting was phenomenal. All of the characters were interesting. Tommys storyline (and Emily) was probably my favorite, but I love a good coming of age tale. I mean, all he wants to do is live a normal teen life. Youd have to be cold-hearted not to root for the guy. The Noah-Quentin bromance comes in a close second, and may have been first if Noah hadnt been absent for the end arc there and, well, the whole twist with Quentin after the June 13th episode soured it a bit for me.

Oh, and Hiro Nakamura is officially my favorite character. I want to name my son after him. His first name will be Hiro Nakamura. He will be the master of time and space, and thats that.

Anywho, the storyline itself was good. It lagged a bit in episodes 10-11, but picked up steam in the last two. Im starting to notice that trend in 13 episode series. But the climax was phenomenal. The villain was well-developed. And magic was always there. I recommend it. Now off to watch the original series. Not sure Ill feel the same, but ya never know! ",1485043200,4,3493,4.4183514774494554

My jaw dropped when they ended the Haitian. I think the whole thing was well planned out, well written, well acted. Why there will be no more Heroes, I don't understand. But whatever. We got some good closure, and got to see some of our favorite characters from the series. I wish Peter Petrelli had been there, at least for an episode or two, but it works without him. Between the Haitian, HRG, and Hiro, there was enough of a callback to the series to hold onto, but I still wish more had come back. I have no major nits with any of the episodes, as I felt they were pretty solid. The way it plays out, in my opinion, is the next evolution of the show. I do like that they didn't pick up right after season 4; I get it, not enough of the actors came back for them to be able to, but still, it was a good idea. HRG was spot on as always, all of the originals were. It's like no time passed between Season 4 and this.

7608239,1,B01AT251SE,"1. Loaded with borrowed (stolen?) film hooks from other similar films. Super power (what ever that means) human(s) being pursued by evil gov/corporate group headed by, usually, (trending now) female nasty.
2. Cheap graphics & CGI effects, e.g butterfly that looks like a child's cutout; fake fire; paper appearing cut outs of flying people. Lots of shots of the Aurora Borealis as filler.
3. Juvenile dialogue oriented to the under 16 audience to help understand what's going on.
4. 75% of the film is standing around with robotic talking/acting. A lot of it just to prolong/lengthen film as filler to make four discs. The acting (ha!) extras look really fakey amateurish (especially the panic running scenes). And, always found in these films is a scene of cars abandoned with debris strewn about; all look artificially placed by the props people.
5. The science would get a failing grade in a middle school science class. Instant transporting of people with a thought - think about it. Flying, OK, well everyone is doing it in film so it's just second nature now. Add to that the stopping time then moving things around - just Gawd awful writing.  Stopping a world wide Earth destroying storm by screaming while holding your arms up? Solar flare causes the Earth's magnetic poles to reverse - sorry, that won't pass middle school science either.",1462233600,,1347,4.933920704845815

7608243,4,B01AT251SE,"This is part reboot, part continuation of the original Heroes series that bowed out with mostly a whimper years prior.  It tells the story of what happened after Claire Bennet outed the heroes (referred to in this series as Evos, short for evolved humans, and of course involves another threat to the world.  While Hayden Panettiere does not appear in the show, aside from a couple season 4 video clips and a picture of her from season 1 (because of her role on the show Nashville), her character has a ton of influence over the events of this season, and she is referenced a lot.

The show did a good job mixing characters from the original series (Greg Grunberg, Masi Oka, Jimmy Jean Louise, Christine Rose, Sendhil Ramamurthy, and Noah Gray-Cabey all reprise their roles), with the main character being HRG, played by Jack Coleman.  The season starts with him in the aftermath of a bombing without his memory trying to put together the pieces of what will ultimately be a much larger plot.  I will not go into a lot of character details because to do so would spoil the story, but the standouts to me were Greg Grunberg taking on a much different Matt Parkman that was seen in the original series, and Zachary Levi, who is playing a character about as far from what he played on Chuck as possible.

I do think the 13 episode run for the series was much better than trying to cram 22-24 episodes into the season.  Although I think it did make some of the plot elements feel a bit rushed, the flow was much more like season 1, which was about as perfect a season any TV series has ever had, and much less disjointed like the other seasons (especially season 2 which was cut short by the writer's strike) were.  I do like how the show took something that was grounded in actual science, in the shifting of the magnetic poles of the earth, and made an interesting science fiction story out of it.

For those who get the discs, the show looks great on Blu-Ray, as you would expect.  The extras consist of deleted scenes from most of the episodes, a 10 min behind the scenes feature with the cast and crew about making the new series, and a 45 min six-part show telling the backstory of Quentin and Pheobe, two of the new characters this season, that basically leads up to episode 1 of the show.  All in all, good for what is there.

The show is not perfect, just like seasons 2-4 were not perfect, but I think it did kind of redeem itself for the dud that season 4 really turned out to be.  There were, of course, no sightings of Peter or Sylar, because neither Zachary Quinto nor Milo Ventimiglia had any interest in returning.  Rya Kihlstedt who played Erica Kravit did a good job taking on one of the main bad guy roles, and I think they effectively told the story they were looking to tell.  My only real complaint is that they again ended the series on a cliffhanger, hoping (or wishful thinking) that another season would materialize.  As most know it ended up being canceled so at least in the near future there will be no continuation, so it does leave things up in the air a bit.  That said, I think for die-hard fans of the show it is worth checking out, if you can accept that it is a different series than what came before.",1460592000,5,3233,4.397651006711409
7608244,3,B01AT251SE,"I was one of the loyal few who stuck with Heroes until the bitter end  mainly because I knew it was going to be the bitter end.  As a result, I was going to skip Heroes Reborn  that is until they cast Zachary Levi in the show.  I had to give it a chance to see him in another role since I was such a huge fan of Chuck.  This show reminded me exactly what the strengths and weaknesses of the original series could be.

Our series opens several years after the events of the Heroes series finale.  Evos, as those with abilities have become to be known, were living among us normal people until a horrible disaster strikes and Suresh (guest star Sendhil Ramamurthy) takes responsibility in the name of all evos.  Suddenly, they are now enemy number one, and must go into hiding to avoid being tracked down as part of a government program.

Our story opens a year after this horrible attack and follows Tommy (Robbie Kay) and his mother (Krista Bridges), who have spent the last year moving from place to place to hide his ability.  Then theres Luke Collins (Zachary Levi) and his wife Joanne (Judith Shekoni) who are hunting down all the evos they can to kill them.  Over in Japan, Ren (Toru Uchikado) and Miko (Kiki Sukezane) have made a startling discovery about who she really is.  Then theres the young girl in the far north with a strange ability (Danika Yarosh).  In the familiar faces department, we have Noah Bennett (Jack Coleman), who doesnt remember anything from the past.

What no one realizes is that our world is facing annihilation, and these evos are our only hope.  Will they be able to work together to save the world?

As you can see, the old formula of having a variety of characters eventually coming together for one mission is still in place.  At times this was entertaining since the stories were so scattered it was hard to see how everything would come together.  And other times, it was just as frustrating because it seemed like the stories were distracting more than anything else.  Usually, this frustration came when I felt wed begun to get some traction on our story the previous week only to have very little forward progress the next.  Heck, there was one story that still felt like it was just filling time on the show when everything ended.

A few of the old characters did pop up for a few episodes, which was fun at first.  I actually began to dread that since I didn't like what they did with many of these old friends.

I already mentioned being a fan of Zachary Levi thanks to his days on Chuck.  It was interesting watching him play a very different character.  I thought he was great.  Likewise, I enjoyed seeing Robbie Kay outside of Once Upon a Time, where he made an awesome Peter Pan.  The returning cast slipped into their characters perfectly, and the rest of the new cast were just as great.

It continues to amaze me when I see how far TV special effects have come.  I bought everything I saw on the screen week after week, and since this is a fantasy/sci-fi show there are plenty of effects.

When the show was on point, it was still fun.  The fantasy filled with some very creative powers works.  Unfortunately, the plot still wanders with sub-plots and characters that could have been trimmed or cut altogether.  One week Id love the show, and the next Id be bored.  In other words, it was just like the old Heroes.

Oh, and can we mentioned that they left us with a bit of a teaser cliffhanger even though this was supposed to be a 13 episode event series?  Yeah, not impressed.

The 13 episode event series is captured on four DVDs or three Blu-rays.  Extras include two featurettes and some deleted scenes.

Die hard fans of the franchise will want to watch Heroes Reborn.  The rest of us can skip this in favor of something that is consistently entertaining.

7608245,3,B01AT251SE,No Syler. No talk of what happend to his character. No Clair Bennie ( blond wig on bed doesn't count). Two stars gone for both show and review.,1457913600,2,143,4.142857142857143
7608246,5,B01AT251SE,"Great series!!! I miss characters like Claire, Peter and Sylar and wish we found out what happened to the latter two but its really great. Noah takes a major role for the first half of the series and then starts to take a backseat after episode 8. Not much airtime in 9 and 10 then doesn't reappear until near the end of episode 13. He focuses on trying to discover the truth about what happened to Claire and finds more than he ever bargained for. AND he plays a major role in saving the world too. A direct one. Best line: ""You two have your destiny, this is mine. Its time to save the world.""

Then there's Tommy Clark the kid with the teleportation power only not. It was cool as he tries to find himself then learns its up to him the save the world and tries to come to terms with that as he tries to understand his destiny and the true scope of his power which is so much more than he knows. LOVED the final episode when Tommy wears the Kensei Sword as he saves the world and even wields it briefly.

Then there's the threat that's coming, the HELE, the Human Extinction Level Event. Previous events that have been stopped are ones that have repercussions into the future (the explosion) or take awhile before the world is over (the virus and formula). THIS is immediate and will destroy the world if its not stopped by the end of the show. Its even a realistic threat too: two massive solar flares hitting the Earth while the magnetic poles shift (ala 2012 the movie) and frying the planet. Something like that could ACTUALLY happen, solar flares destroying the Earth.",1457395200,,1575,4.390410958904109
