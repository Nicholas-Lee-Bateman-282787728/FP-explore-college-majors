8339724,2,B001SGEUDI,"Ceremonia Sangrienta (Blood Castle) (Jorge Grau, 1973)

Jorge Grau is best remembered in English-speaking countries for the utterly ridiculous The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue, one of the silliest zombie movies of all time. Ceremonia Sangrienta is likely his second-best-known movie, Grau's take on the tale of Erzebet Bathory, the countess who believed she could keep herself young by bathing in the blood of virgins. Now, before I say this, your mileage may vary, and mine does on occasion, but the thing about these two Grau films (IMDB tells me he's made twenty-eight more; I haven't stumbled across any of them) that rubbed me the wrong way is his insistence on taking a shoestring budget and still trying to come up with realistic-looking scenery. Man, if you can't afford to rent an actual medieval castle, don't build one out of styrofoam and color it grey, either work with a room or two or modernize your story and put your new Bathory in Polish block housing. (Hey, Polish block housing worked great for Kieslowski's movies, don't knock it.) I know some folks find that charming. I'm not one of them. The same can be said of the woeful acting to be found here, though that does tend to be offset by the oodles of attractive young things, even if you'll have a hard time believing any of them were virgins by 1973. Can you believe Lucia Bos&eacute; had, just five years previously, worked with Fellini? * ",1396828800,,1423,4.780487804878049
8339725,4,B001SGEUDI,"The director of the film, Jorge Grau, is less known than other Spanish ""fear makers"" of his generation like Jesus Franco or Paul Nashy. But with only three films (this one and the excellent Pena de Muerte and No Profanar el Sueno de los Muertos) he proves an incredible ability to create disturbing and compelling horror films.

Ceremonia Sangrienta is for me not only his masterpiece, its also the best attempt to do horror cinema in Spain, its as good as other countries with longer horror traditions like the United States, United Kingdom or Italy. The story is fascinating. It proposes a new point of view of the classical myth of the vampire, more realism than existed in the moment that was made the film, and really visionary.

Visually the film is equally splendid. The photography of Fernando Arribas, present in a lot of Spanish horror films like La Cruz del Diablo, Horror Express or the recent Memorias del Angel Caido, is simply extraordinary, giving the film the appropriate color and light.

The cast is perfect, especially the sensual actress Lucia Bose, but its the work of Jorge Grau behind the camera that makes this film so interesting. The tempo has ups and downs and progresses with the force of a train in the night, the mise in scene is classical and stylish at the same time, and I have no doubt that Grau really had known how to capture the essence of vampirism in images.",1386547200,,1398,4.67479674796748
8339726,5,B001SGEUDI,"This Spanish-Italian vampire film from 1973 goes beyond the vampire genre and becomes something else entirely, which was I liked about this 88-minute film. Set in Central Europe during the early 19th century, the story revolves around a dashing nobleman who becomes a vampire, after defying local superstition by wearing a mysterious medallion found around the neck of a staked vampire. Featured in a supporting role is ""Candy"" star E w a A u l I n, a strawberry blonde this time around, who falls in love with him, unereaware he has become a vampire. The plot takes a radical turn when Lucia B o s e, who plays his brooding, sexy wife who, working together with the vampire, turns to strange rituals to retain h
her youthful beauty. Recommended for fans of the vampire genre, this film contains some genuinely gruesome moments.

8339727,3,B001SGEUDI,This is an older title that was not exactly a well known movie. I was hoping this movie would have went into the torture tactics rather than the just story of Erzabet Bathory. I was hoping for horror not drama. Not a bad movie but not the Witchfinder General or Mark of the Devil type of movie I was looking for. I am surpised this hasn't made its way to netflix yet.,1375228800,,367,4.111111111111111
8339728,1,B001SGEUDI,"No vampire.....no monster in the castle.....no anything really. This is one you'll put on to have in the background to fall asleep to, with no chance of anything cool happening to hold your interest.",1369440000,,199,4.882352941176471
8339729,4,B001SGEUDI,"""Legend of Blood Castle"" is one of the best of the slew of international gothic horror movies that were so prominent in the wake of Hammer Film's success. A Spanish telling of the Elizabeth Bathory legend, it is beautifully shot, oozing with atmosphere, acted superbly, and has a great story - truly, it is one of the pinnacles of the genre. So its release from Mya, while appreciated, is both a blessing for being made readily available and a curse for being handled with the company's now-expectedly amateurish gloves. I don't know exactly where Mya gets their prints from but they usually seem to be about the same quality you would expect from one of those ""Mill Creek"" 50-movie sets, yet they come with a hefty ""Criterion Collection"" price-tag. However, it is in widescreen (non-anamorphic) and a pretty decent cut of the film, the most that has been made available since the medium of DVD arrived, though still incomplete. Although 3 audio options are available (English, Italian and Spanish), there are NO English subtitles, save for the few scenes that are presented with Spanish dialogue during the English version. I actually prefer watching these films in their clothed versions, as I feel that the nude scenes so commonly shot for international audiences in these types of movies, are usually extremely silly, unrealistic and take away from the overall seriousness and effect of the story. However, many fans will disagree with me and find much disappointment in the fact that these ""international scenes"" were not edited back into the film, however they are included on the disc as extras. Will we ever get to see a genuine, restored release of of this rarely seen yet much admired classic?? One can only dream and keep their fingers crossed that a company like ""Dark Sky"" or ""Severin"" will provide a truly worthy double-dip on this title, but until then, don't deprive yourself of a delicious visit to Blood Castle.",1335139200,8,1929,4.920245398773006
8339730,3,B001SGEUDI,"It's worth noting that this dvd from Mya utilizes a covered print, ie: nudity filmed for the movie is replaced by 'covered' shots so the film would pass censorship rules in the Franco ruled Spain of the 70's.
This is not what the director intended and not what fans want from a 70's exploitation horror movie.
This is a wonderful film, but Mya has chosen the cheaper, easy route and delivered a dvd that is sure to annoy fans of the film.  Buyer beware.",1251849600,30,453,4.392857142857143
8339731,3,B001SGEUDI,"This movie is a adaption of the Countess Elizabeth Bathory story. She killed over 600 people and used their blood in a attempt to stay young. Only her real life story took place in a castle in hungary in the 1500's.  This story takes place in the 1800's and the main character is supposed to be a decendant of the evil countess.  Many parts of the story are very similiar to the real countess who was walled up alive in her castle and her evil cohorts were all burned.  In this story which is well photographed and done in a good straight forward manner; the evil countess makes her husband fake his death so he can kill victims for her.  The people of that century and earlier did in fact try the dead for being vampires and their idea of vampires is different from ours.  They Believed the body stayed in the ground but the soul came out to suck the life or blood of the living.  At least that's how most europeons looked at vampires until Bram Stokers  ""dracula"" novel. So noone wanted to be a vampire back then , after all rotting in a grave and your soul is out and about is not romantic like a ""Twilight"" book.  I would have rather seen a story about supernatural vampires in a castle but
this story is good enough to be enjoyable for 1970's Europeon made horror film fans.  There is gore and bloodletting but it's not bad by todays standards.  Someday someone will do a real faithful movie about Bathory and it will be very horrible indeed.  The print of this movie looks pretty good and thanks to Mya for getting this older movie to our shores.  Now if they can find some movie like 'orgy of the vampires"" or other supernatural europeon vampire movie that has never been released with a decent print that would make many people happy.  They are putting out 'Island of the fishmen"" aka 'screamers"" and that is excellent news indeed.  The acting is very good in this movie and the whole enterprise was done by veterans and that's another reason to enjoy this movie as well.
It has a english soundtrack and original spanish as well.  So if you are a fan of 1970's Europeon horror then you might enjoy this movie.",1249171200,4,2117,4.392307692307693
