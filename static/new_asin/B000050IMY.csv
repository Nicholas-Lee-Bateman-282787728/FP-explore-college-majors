1385580,5,B000050IMY,I look forward to doing this each day.  You can really feel the burn during and after the workout. It is an intense and quick workout.  This is great for those people who are running on a short schedule.  The instructor has a lot of energy and really knows how to keep you interested in the excersize.  I have started to see results after 3 weeks of working out.  My stomach is becoming more defined.,1023494400,3,400,4.28
1385581,5,B000050IMY,"I bought this DVD after reading the reviews and I have to admit I was very sceptic at first, but after using this product for 2 months it has been the best exercise program that I have ever had!  It is only 08 minutes for each workout and I have honestly lost 2 inches around my waist and 15 pounds!  I am going for 2 more!  Great product for those people that are very busy.  This is the first product that I have followed through with and I believe it is because it is only 08 MINUTES long!! If You have a hard time with those 1-2 hour exercise videos this ones for you!",1018828800,9,572,3.991228070175439
1385582,5,B000050IMY,"I recently developed a very sore painful lower back from too much sitting on the job, bookkeeping.  I was looking for something I could every morning on my way to work to stregthen my back. I found it! I have been doing the abs segment almost every day for one month and my back pain is completely gone. I think I will continue doing this video for ever as insurance.  I will start the arms segment next and write in with that review soon.",1016150400,5,439,4.214285714285714
1385583,5,B000050IMY,"I know those words are rarely used for describing a workout but it definetely needs to be said. I have been using this DVD for a little more than a month (first as a rental then bought from Amazon.com) and already I can see some results in the way my jeans fit. I actually went out today and bought myself a smaller size and they looked great. Anyway, this DVD is perfect because unlike other ab workouts this one those not hurt your back and the fact that all workouts are done in small time intervals makes it seem like your not doing any work at all. It actually helps push you to levels you thought you couldn't reach. Also the other workouts (Bodies in Motion) are great to help burn some fat. The arm workout it also helpful for definition.  No more excuses ladies, this is the one to get.",1015632000,5,795,4.264900662251655
1385584,5,B000050IMY,Both of these workouts are good - The Abs are so hard to get through at first and the Arm workout you will probably want to have some small weights to use along with the video.,1015545600,2,176,3.9166666666666665
1385585,5,B000050IMY,"There is no denying that these workouts really work. After a while you not only see the difference but you feel it to. It feels great to run the workout and see how much more you can do than when you first started.
 I'll agree that the music can become grating after a while, but I've learned to just turn down the volume on the TV and put the radio on when I'm working out. After a while you pretty much learn the routine, so a couple of glances at the TV and you can keep up.
 But this DVD is definitely worth it. Not only do you get a great workout for your ALL of your arms and ALL of your abs, but the bonus workouts and stretching are also effective.
 I highly recommend this DVD, as well as the Buns & Legs.",993686400,12,714,3.9444444444444446
1385586,5,B000050IMY,"I have used this tape everyday now for the past 2 months.  I have seen results.  It is a great tape to work out with, because you can go at your own pace.  Also, there is a constant flow of movement.  Therefore, if you need to take a break, you do less of one exercise, but don't miss out on the entire routine.  My mom even started doing it with me.  There are various levels that she was able to work at.  Try it for yourself, you will get a lot out of these exercises.  For abs each exercise is 45 seconds and for arms each is 30 seconds.  Although it is a continious 8 minutes in rotation.  Try it!  You'll LOVE it!",993168000,65,619,3.951219512195122

1385634,5,B000050IMY,"I began using 8 Minute Abs in my college days. Over a decade later, this is still one of my favorite workouts. I like that the workout is not too intimidating to begin when you've wandered away from exercise for months/years, yet you can really feel it the first few days of doing this regimen. It's hard at first, and it will burn!  However, after a few weeks of doing this daily, it's difficult to remember how hard it was in the beginning. No joke!  I'm speaking to the ab workout here. I can't testify to the arm workout, as I only bought the DVD to replace an old VHS tape of 8 Minute Abs. The arm workout was a bonus on this DVD.

Best of all is that it goes at a good pace (he encourages you to go slower at first and work into it), and the 8 minutes is up before you know it! It's fun, feasible, and fast. The cheesy 80s music is just a bonus. :)",1401753600,,854,3.982456140350877

1385654,5,B000050IMY,"This is an excellent DVD to strengthen and tone your abs.  I had this in VHS format (remember those?) and used it for several years until my VHS player broke.  Even if you are soft around the middle, this 8 minute routine will not tax your abilities.  The instructor even tells you not to push too hard if you are just beginning.  I have tried other ab crunching videos that were just brutal but this one can easily strengthen and define your abs without straining your body.  The instructor makes sure every excercise puts no pressure on your lower back.  I would recommend this to anyone.",1315958400,,590,4.518867924528302

1385656,5,B000050IMY,"I've been doing this workout for several years now.  The most amazing part about this video is how it has been carefully designed to change up which part of your abs you target with each variation.  If you keep pace with the instructor, you will be doing about 20 crunches with each variation.  By the time you've finished the 8 minutes, you've chalked up over 200 crunches.  I agree with some reviews here, mostly for those interested in toning, but it is fun bragging about those 200+ crunches I do every day!  Highly recommended.",1258588800,,532,4.617021276595745
1385657,3,B000050IMY,"This DVD may be great for beginners, but I find these exercises to be too easy.  I consider myself to be somewhat of an intermediate exerciser.  I'm by no means in tip top shape and I was hoping this workout would be a nice challenge but after a few weeks of doing this dvd I never really saw any results.  The exercises may be a challenge for a beginner but more experienced exercisers will be bored with this.",1219276800,,411,4.243589743589744

To be honest, I'm already pretty lean with just a few inches of unwanted pudge in certain areas but after only 2 weeks I've already seen results with this DVD as well as the 8 minute buns and legs work out. This is not for hard-core exercisers but if you're looking for an easy way to keep in shape and tone up key areas, this is a great way to do it.",1210723200,,532,3.9813084112149535

1385674,5,B000050IMY,"(I am only commenting on the ab portion of the DVD, since this is all that I use)  Guys, this is seriously a really great ab workout.  The DVD itself is a little old, but the workout in my opinion has withstood the test of time.  There are many different ab exercises you go through in the course of 8 minutes and they all isolate certain areas of your abs that will make you want to beg for mercy by the end of the workout.  8 minutes is long enough to get a great ab workout and this DVD proves it. Do this consistently, meaning on a daily basis, and you will see results.  I have been doing this now for about 3 months and definitely see some definition (I would see more, but I am trying to bulk up actually, so I am not dieting yet to tone up).  Anyway, well worth the money, so check it out.",1163116800,2,797,3.981132075471698

The workouts are easy to follow and are effective, too. I always feel the burn after I finish. The DVD has some great aerobic ""bonus"" workouts. When I do the bonus workouts in conjunction with the 8 min. ab or arm workouts, I feel as if I got a decent workout in a short amount of time.

surprisingly enough, i actually do feel a slight burn at the end of the segment. the dvd's strategy is to work your abs nonstop.

what i love about this dvd is the bonus material, which i end up using more then the ab portion. there's this tae-bo kickboxing segment (kai-bae) that i do regularly. it tends to exercise one side more, so i compensate by starting with the opposite side each time i do it.

i'd say this is an alright dvd. i recommend getting it if all you want is a quick and mild ab workout. i can see how over time it can strengthen your abs. but if you want something more hard core, this is not the one.",1128816000,2,772,4.065789473684211

I even had the indention below my obliques.

Doing weight training on my own I didn't know the proper form or in what order to do the exercises to create the most effective routine.  This DVD fixed all that, 8-minutes didn't seem that long so I gave it a try and was sweating and puffing because you move from one exercise to another so quickly with no rest your heart rate stays up.  I alternate this with the 8-minute buns & legs and combine them with Pilates for dummies (video) and my 30-minute treadmill walk.

1385712,5,B000050IMY,"I've been using this DVD for the last week, and I never thought that  8 minutes would give me the workout that this seems to!  I've only used the arms section, but if the abs workout is anything like the arms, it has to be just as great.
I really feel as though this workout is doing the trick.  It's too early to tell, but these are standard exercises, so presumably I'll see results in the near future.  I feel great after using this and the Pilates for Dummies DVD!  For the first time in my life, I LOOK FORWARD to working out!",1046390400,6,531,4.116504854368932
1385713,4,B000050IMY,"I love these 8-minute workouts!  I have both the buns/legs and arms/abs DVD.  There's really nothing WOW or super fancy here -- these are just honest-to-goodness workouts. It's super easy to squeeze in one or two 8 minute sessions in the morning before work plus they really do seem to be effective.  Best of all the people aren't annoying or boring. One thing that's really cool is that there is no counting -- they tally reps by time (eg: 30 seconds doing this, 1 minute doing that, etc.).",1045612800,2,491,4.556818181818182
1385714,5,B000050IMY,"Forget the excuses.  8 minute abs is short, easy and effective.  Do it everyday and you will notice results.  PERIOD.  Do not buy the VHS version, you'll wear out the tape.  The DVD is much better.  Apart from the 8 minute abs I have also done the 8 minute stretch and cardio exercises for when I was not able to make it to the gym.",1043712000,2,332,4.030769230769231
1385715,5,B000050IMY,"I (like a reviewer way down below) also had the 8-minute abs/arms workout on VHS and have recently upgraded to DVD.  I too agree that this will work for your flabby tummy and jiggly arms, expecially if you're anything like me - a person who does not at all enjoy exercising.  As to the 80's ""gang"" who will assist with your new transformation (I've renamed them, Todd, Sven and Belinda Carlisle) their personal styles are indeed dreadful, but their bodies are nice and tight.  It's not a bad incentive to try to look like a hot 80's chick.  Buy the DVD, laugh your butt off at how cheesy it is and firm up your beer belly!",1034726400,,622,4.336206896551724
1385716,5,B000050IMY,"I had this workout on vhs and I loved it, however I no longer have a vhs player so I tried to order it on dvd. I have NOT received it yet. The shipping servive or Jaime Brenkus is extremely slow. I would not order anything from them.",1031529600,,233,3.875
1385717,5,B000050IMY,"I really enjoy this DVD.  A few years ago, I bought 8 minute abs on video cassette and used it until the tape wore out.  The video was just 8 minutes of ab work and that was it.  I pretty much had the 8 minutes down, but after my tape broke I realized I needed the (albeit cheesy) motivation of the intructor making me do the movements for eight minutes.  I am so glad I went ahead and replaced the video with this DVD.  I really enjoy the arm workout and the bonus workouts too.  The abs workout is pretty intense, even after all of these years.  The good thing about it is that it is very concentrated and efficient.  After just 8 minutes I feel more toned than with other ab videos that might last up to 30 minutes.  The arm workout is good too, although I think it focuses mostly on shoulders, which is fine, especially if you alternate with other arm programs.  It is a little silly that they have the woman doing the movements with no weights and the big men using 5 pounders and 15 oz tomato cans.  I generally use 15 to 5 pounds for the arm exercises and because it is 8 minutes, it feels very rushed. You have to be ready to switch weights fast or go light.  Still it is a great way to do something good for yourself in a very short time.  There is an 8 minute stretch routine on this DVD which is a good warm up and easy even for people who aren't very flexible.  I was also pleasantly surprised with the ""bonus"" workouts.  These are really just excerpts from other people's workouts, as an advertisement, but they are good too.  I have this DVD in my sometimes temperamental computer and I like the fact that I can use it for cardio without having to switch to a different disc.  There is a 20 minute kick boxing routine done by a HUGE person.  I don't know a lot about kickboxing, but this routine is still fun to try and works up a sweat.  There is a 20 minute aerobics routine that looks like it came straight out of the 80's with big bangs and shiny tights, but it is a great leg and thigh workout.  It is set up so you can do the whole 15-20 minutes together or divide it into 5 minute circuits.
This DVD gives you a lot of options and you can get a total body workout very efficiently.",1028851200,24,2202,4.124413145539906
1385718,5,B000050IMY,"TRIED & TRUE! {  }bought this video out of sheer luck 4 months ago. And boy, do those 8 minute workouts work!!! I have been doing them about 5 times a week, and my abs not only lost inches, but they also have gotten so much stronger and better looking!
I won't say the ab excecises are easy for the beginners, but you will soon be able to complete the whole thing if you
stick to it. As for arms, I have been doing them 3~4 times a week, and my arms are much firmer and shaplier! What's
great about the arm segment is that the beginners use no weights, but can progress to tomato can and heavier
weights at their own pace, resulting in more strength and muscular development/toning! I also love the bonus 8 minute stretching workout, and do them everyday, even just to relax! I got my husband to do those excercises with me too!
If you want to have a flatter stomach and toned arms while spending least time and money, this is the video for you!
FYI : I do yoga and other cardio / strengthing workout to get a full workout in addition to this video.",1028764800,9,1049,4.193069306930693
1385719,5,B000050IMY,"This video proves that there really is no substitute but good old fashioned sweat to get results. Being an avid runner, I worked on my abs many times a week, and thought they were in pretty good shape. I guess I was wrong! This video made my abs feel like they had been worked more than any other program, and I have only had it for a week. I would highly recommend this video for anyone looking to tone their midsection.",1026950400,3,421,4.209876543209877
1385720,5,B000050IMY,"I bought this primarily because of the reviews I read here and the fact that exercise DVS are still a rarity (love DVD format).  I was skeptical because I thought ""How am I going to tone my big fat stomach in 8 minutes a day?""  Well my friends this WORKS.  I am already seeing a difference in 3 weeks.  What's more, the video, while challenging, is easy to follow.  I hate it when the exercises are so complicated that I am not sure if I am even doing the exercises correctly.  You will have no problem following these.  I had bad lower back pain when I began this program and it is just about gone now.  My Doc gave me a sheet of back exercises to do, but I never wanted to do them.  As a bonus, there are some cool bonus workouts including a 20 minute kick boxing workout done by a tough navy seal looking dude.  Boyfriend thought that was cool.  I bought the ""8 minute workout"" DVD set that includes butt, abs, arms, legs, etc.  It wasn't much more money just to get everything at once.  I have to try the other workouts and will report to you!",1026345600,40,1047,4.149253731343284
