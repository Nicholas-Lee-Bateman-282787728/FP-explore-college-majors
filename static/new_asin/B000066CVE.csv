7962285,5,B000066CVE,"Perhaps the magic can't be recaptured. Certainly this series of six episodes is what critics like to call ""dated"", whatever that means (usually cheesy or in a style nobody uses any more). People will likely find this series both a bit cheesy and certainly in a style nobody would use any more. It's an amalgam of music video, kitchen sink drama, and prescient warning of the Thatcherite world to come. If you were young, and you were there, it was breathtaking (it changed my young life, for sure). What anyone, certainly modern Americans, will make of it I can hardly guess--they'll probably be so confused by the accents and argot and put off by the poor production values that they'll never see it through. But along with The Ascent of Man, Civilization, The Prisoner, and The Key to the Universe it provided me, a young American watching British reruns in the 1970s, a window on the world my own culture never provided. I don't just love this series--I owe it.",1371513600,2,964,4.676470588235294
