689102,2,6303584845,"Nearly RIGHT after I saw Children of the Corn II on Cinemax, I saw a commercial for Part III. Before I saw part II, this movie was out. I said  ""Who makes these movies! "" They both looked really stupid. But I  saw Part II on Cinemax and really liked it. So, I thought nothing about  renting Part III. I saw it and thought it was going to be good based on the  fact alone that the kid from Demonic Toys was in it. But I hated it. The  whole thing was stupid and then the ending. I can't say enough bad things  about that ending. I rented it again after I got sorround sound and I like  it better now.

The acting was decent, the killing were decent (except for when the woman gets her face burned and the kid looks at her laughing mercifully, that was corny). Charlize Theron appears for like 2 minutes (gets killed somehow similar to Evil Dead in that she gets tangled with vines and the monster sticks his branch down her....you know where). The movie is lame, has some moments of goodness but still...after this sequel the rest of the series really is a wash and total waste of time, it started here.",1354665600,,587,4.547169811320755
689291,2,6303584845,"""Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest"" is a somewhat tacky and unnecessary sequel to the moderately successful Stephen King adaptation and its slightly under-rated sequel.

In the film, two youths from Gatlin (the setting of the first two films) are taken in by a yuppie couple in Chicago. The older of the two fits in relatively well, but the younger has plans of his own. Planting a corn field in the abandoned property next door, he creeps out his adoptive parents and eventually converts the entire teenage population to his maze worshipping cult.

Despite a predictable plot that seems to be missing chunks (at what point did Eli win over his peers?), dodgy special effects and wooden performances by its relatively unknown cast, the film is moderately enjoyable for what it is. If you want to see some brutal and over-the-top death scenes committed by vegetation, then ""Children of the Corn III"" hardly disappoints. Elsewhere, however, the film comes up short, and that's all there really is to it.

The film was dumped in theaters briefly in 1994 before being thrust into complete oblivion, making room for four direct-to-video sequels and a made-for-TV&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/remake/dp/B002KH4KSY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">remake</a>.

I thought it was kind of funny how its in the city and that kid eli is seriously demented! and this movie did indeed scare the crap outta me. The only part i can safely say i thought was downright stupid was the ending. The part where the ""monster"" picks up that girl, it looks like a doll! it IS a doll! you can totaaly tell. But anyway if you are thinking about buying this (and if you don't mind a stupid ending)u should give it a try. I am collecting this bad ending or not. for me it is still a somewhat good movie and i am trying to collect the whole series. Go children of the corn!! It is kind of like the TCM:next generation of the children of the corn series i would like to mention. The end-",1257552000,,840,4.0359281437125745
689293,3,6303584845,"He Who Walks Behind The Rows is back, bigger and badder (and weirder) than ever.  The first two films in this series disappointed me by jumping straight to the parts of the stories where children decide to start dispatching of adults.  This time, however, the agricultural monstrosity must rely on his newest prophet, the cute-as-a-button Eli.

The movie actually has a strong start, as Eli and his brother-by-adoption, Joshua, escape the clutches of their alcoholic farmer father.  The two kids are adopted by an upwardly mobile couple in Chicago, and Eli wastes no time in converting the local population into his weird brand of Ultra-Violent Environmental Satan Worship.

Eli's preaching gets old fast (like most kinds of preaching, if you ask me) as he screams about purity and adults polluting the Earth.  But as he (and his uber-corn) set about getting rid of those who stand in the way, the film achieves actual scares (although most of the time it's just gross).  Eli's adopted parents just happen to live next to a massive, abandoned factory.  ""It's dangerous there,"" the father says, which is why he has erected a tiny wooden fence four feet away from the factories looming brick walls.  It seems like mostly a symbolic gesture, but his heart is in the right place.

Unfortunately, in spite of some pretty nasty effects and unsettling deaths (who knew a human spine was over eight feet long?), the movie succumbs to stupid theatrics in the last half of its final act.  Finally, we are treated to an up-close-and-personal look at HWWBTR, and it's mostly just silly.  Pay close enough attention, and you'll get to see Charlize Theron in her first theatric role as a woman who is horribly, horribly violated by Eli's Cob King.  (You'll also see several extras laughing as they are killed, and the disgusting deaths of at least two different Barbie dolls.)

Oh, well.  At least it's amusing.  Scarier and funnier than either of the films that came before it, URBAN HARVEST doesn't really do King's story any justice, but it's fun for a nauseating chuckle or two.",1238716800,,2068,4.865714285714286

689295,4,6303584845,"This children of the corn is deffinatally the best of the series. it has great acting, a great plot and all of the rest. I really enjoyed watching this movie cause it actually makes sense. Most of the movie makes sense anyways. the only two parts that didn't make sense were the seen were Joshua and malcolm were driving in the car. They drove from Chicago, illinois to ???,Nebraska spent time there and drove back all in the same night??? Thats a long drive! it would take atleast 2 to 4 days to do all of that! come on that doesnt make any sense and the other part that didn't make any sense was at the end where that big monster comes up from beneath the ground.now come on guys,does that have anything to do with ""Children of The Corn""? now, on the other hand if it was called monsters of the corn, then it would make complete sense! But overall,this was a really enjoyable movie, and it is deffinatally worth the time, so you should tottaly check it out.",1233878400,2,959,4.333333333333333
689296,2,6303584845,"Well, Children of the Corn Part I was pretty cool and Part II was just OK, and now we take alook at ""Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest"". Let me start off by saying I live in Chicago, so this movie was made right by me, even though I live in the south suburbs.

Well, like alot of these movies, it opens in a flashback. We see two boys, one a teenager, one probably like 12, then their drunken, abusive father trying to chop his own kids with a scythe. But the younger boy, has some sort of witch-craft power built in him, and he uses his black magic to kill the father.

Now the boys are adopted in Chicago by a couple, whom find them normal....at first. The younger brother is the evil one, while the older brother is the normal one. Well, while checking the suitcase, the foster mother realizes it is nothing but bugs and creepy crawlies. But when the father opens it, he finds nothing but clothes and fresh corn. The boys care for eachother, sleep in the same bed. While the younger evil brother is the laughing stock of the school, the normal older brother finds himself making lots of friends and getting popular. He makes a majority of his friends playing basketball with kids. His best friend later is named Malcom, who comes with him to uncover the secret of his brother, Malcom also has one of the most comedicly dumb deaths ever in a horror film, where is head is pulled off and his neck stretches 40 feet.

The end where all the children of the school are possessed by Eli is one of the worst endings ever made, it is the cheapestm dumbest MONSTER look I've ever seen, it looks like a drunken New Years celebration, and the fakest effects with dolls.

I really did not care for Children of the Corn 3, I thought it was incredibly stupid, pointless, and had terrible effects in it, I wouldn't recommend this to any horror fan, but a COMEDY fan might like it. I give it a 2/5.",1196208000,,1891,4.31830985915493
689297,2,6303584845,"I can't believe anyone would think about putting the third Children of the Corn movie on the same level as the original and part 2.  Come on, the original was the best, and the second one was really good as well.  Part 3 contains cheap, ugly-looking production that doesn't have any scare factor whatsoever.  The corn field is inside the city, for crying out loud.  How scary can that be?

At least the fourth movie was a bit of an improvement.  I would strongly recommend looking into the first two Children of the Corn movies before spending money on this low budget film.  That's just my opinion though, and usually I'm wrong.",1161388800,,629,4.5625
689404,1,6303584845,"I repeat, the original had no room for a sequel. What a waste of film and talent. This stuff is worthless. Enough said.",1142726400,,119,4.217391304347826
689405,3,6303584845,"'Children of the Corn 3' is pretty damn entertaining.  Not as good as two, but still superior to the original and well worth watching.  It's certainly never effective as a straight horror movie, but it's got plenty of camp appeal and some amusing gore.  This one is sorta vaguely related to the original central story, as it's about little creepy Eli and larger, normal Joshua who are adopted brothers.  At the films beginning  Eli murders his adopted father so they have to move in with a foster family... IN THE CITY!!!!!  Eli is some sorta evil corn warlock and he starts killin' people for no particular reason and works on a scheme to feed tainted super-corn to all the world with the unwitting help of their foster father, who is some sort of corn magnate.  What's worse, Eli starts preaching at the toughest Catholic school in the hood and starts converting everyone, to create a whole new pack of corn children!  That all sounds pretty silly, I'm sure, and it is, but they try to take is seriously, which is nice.  Intentionally camp movie do work sometimes, but they can rarely compare to something which was meant to be taken seriously.  Though actually, I don't wanna be to hard on it, as it's actually more competent than a lotta films of this caliber.  I get the feeling that the director could manage a pretty decent horror movie if he had a decent script and a moderate budget.  But this is what we got, and there ain't much they can do with this plot, and the dude who plays Eli just ain't menacing, like Malachi was in the first one.  Still, it's pretty awesome, with a nice scarecrow attack, a corncifiction, a big scary corn monster that eats a doll, some computer generated fireballs, a crazy agitated priest, a chick totally melting, a corn-thieving hobo who gets his comeuppance, icky bugs, a scary corn-bible and a glimpse into the mysterious world of international corn trade.  If all that hasn't convinced you that you need to see 'Children of the Corn 3', that I don't think it's gonna happen.  Also, Charlize Theron has a small role as one of the new Children of the Corn towards the end.  Not that I can imagine why you'd care, though it does show how life really can change- in ten years she went all the way from 'Children of the Corn 3' to... ... .... ...'Aeon Flux'.  You've come a long way, baby.

689406,3,6303584845,Despite the rotten ending this direct-to-video movie has good special effects and a few effective scenes. Two brothers move to Chicago and one of them is the children them of the corn and move with a foster family and the weird thing is the dad dislikes the older brother while the mom hates the younger brother. The other brother brings seeds that grow a cornfield in a vacant lot and rise the evil spirits and soon weird things start happening. Screaming Mad George's special effects are good especially the teen getting turned into a cornstock and blood shooting everywhere though the only fake effect was when a girl was getting picked up by the cornfiled monster they used doll and you could see the small doll that looked so unrealistic. the only part that was bad was the ending which was rotten.,1106092800,,803,4.661971830985915
689407,4,6303584845,"No other author in recent memory has had as much consistent success selling books as Stephen King. For roughly three decades the Maine writer churned out book after book, each one selling more and more copies. He's a world unto himself, the lucky fellow! He's so successful that he could throw out his pens, put away his typewriters, bury his word processor six feet under, never write another word in his life, and STILL have enough money to wallpaper the Great Wall of China five times over. In many respects, it's Stephen King's world and the rest of us are just living in it. But, and this is a gigantic but, an enormous number of metaphysically bad films based on his novels threaten to put a serious dent in his legacy. We all know the good ones, the ones that not only scared audiences stiff but also helped propel King's career to even greater heights. ""Carrie"" is probably the best example, followed by ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Dead Zone."" These are wonderful, magical films that one can watch again and again without wearying of them. Then there are the rest: the truly wretched refuse that reminds one of dental plaque or the junk that washes up on the shores of a filthy river. Welcome to the Children of the Corn franchise.

""Children of the Corn 3: Urban Harvest"" moves far beyond the parameters established in the first film. Instead of Isaac issuing the doom and gloom prophecies of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows,"" we now have Eli (Daniel Cerny) stepping up to the plate. He and his older ""brother"" Joshua (Ron Melendez) turn up in Chicago after Joshua's father, who had the temerity to question Eli's increasingly bizarre behavior, perished in a hideous manner back on the Nebraska farm. Adopted by William Porter (Jim Metzler)--a big shot at an agricultural firm specializing in the creation of resistant grains--and his wife Amanda (Nancy Lee Grahn), Eli and Joshua seem like fish out of water in the Windy City. Right from the start it's obvious that Eli is a little strange; it is also obvious that he has some sort of weird hold over Joshua. How odd is the pint-sized preacher? His new mother opens his suitcase only to find it packed full of ears of corn covered in huge bugs. Screeching like a banshee, Alice is astonished to discover that the insects were just a hallucination of some sort. Hmmm. Anyway, Eli soon realizes that a huge, abandoned warehouse right next door to the house provides fertile ground for a few rows of special corn. This crop grows to full height in a matter of hours, is impervious to disease and other forms of damage, and tastes great.

William Porter soon learns about the crop and dreams about how much money he can make selling these plants around the world, an idea encouraged by Eli. In the meantime, the two kids enroll in a Catholic school run by the kindly Father Frank Nolan (Michael Ensign). Eli continues to try and control Joshua, but his influence seems on the wane. With the help of Malcolm (Jon Clair) and his cute sister Maria (Nari Morrow), Joshua begins to emerge from his shell. He takes up basketball despite Eli's objections, and even strikes up a physical relationship with Maria. The young preacher turns his attention to the other kids in school, lecturing them about the importance of children in scripture and thus usurping Father Frank's authority. He even stands up one day during services to relate his interpretations of the holy word. Predictably, the kids soon fall under Eli's power. Joshua, with the help of Malcolm, heads back to Nebraska to unearth an important book buried there by Eli that just might help defeat the evil intentions of ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" and his earthly minion. We finally see the incarnation of this demon when Eli holds a ceremony in the warehouse. The film ends on one of those ""the evil goes on even though we thought it was over"" themes.

Actually, ""Children of the Corn 3"" isn't half bad. Director James D.R. Hickox is well known as a purveyor of schlocky yet entertaining low budget horror, so maybe that has something to do with it. I got a real kick out of the Eli character, who I thought looked like a miniature version of a certain ""Grease 2"" star (The movie should carry the title ""Honey, I Shrunk Adrian Zmed""). He's not as eerie as Isaac in the first one, but he does carry a certain unease about him. The guy who played Father Frank was a real hoot, too. His hysterics make Rod Steiger's priest in ""The Amityville Horror"" look tame by comparison. But what really takes the cake in ""Corn 3"" are the imaginative kill scenes and cheesy special effects. A head bursting into flames, a combination garden tool/pipe atrocity, and people torn apart by ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" insures a good time for all. The model the filmmakers used to depict the corn demon, however, looks woefully inadequate. At one point the beastie snacks on a kid, but it's so obvious that the crew stuck a doll in the creature's mouth that I howled with laughter for hours afterwards. By the way, Charlize Theron appears in a bit part as one of Eli's followers during the final showdown.

Trailers for parts four, five, and six of ""Children of the Corn,"" ""Dracula 2000,"" ""Halloween: H20,"" and ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" are the only extras on the disc. I would recommend ""Children of the Corn 3"" over most of the other entries in the series. Sure, it is cheap and cheesy, but it's also a lot of fun. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours of your time.",1103932800,4,5496,4.622313203684749

They are so into killing in all of these sequals that they never acually have the chance to make it better. Another King classic shutting down, thats what. But lets go back to the movie. What the hell happened at the end? And that POTATO was He Who Walks Behind The Rows? Damn it to hell! The one chance of a good COTC movie and all of us beg for one, RIGHT? But no.

Surprisingly, this third in the long-running series is actually the best of the bunch. Changing settings didn't work for ""Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhatten"", but surplanting the Corn Kids in suburban Chicago gives this series an energetic kick.  Two silblings (Daniel Cerny, Ron Melendez) are adopted by a couple in Chicago, but the younger brother cannot escape the evil of He Who Walks Behind The Rows... and small town havoc is unleashed in big city Chi-Town. Featuring some imaginative sequences and genunie surprises, ""Corn III"" packs a pretty good punch.  The finale was meant to be horrifying, but obvious budget contraints really turn the final battle into a joke.

Finally , the cliche was taken out of the cornfields and into the  urban city . Daniel cerny's performance was not only chilling but  overshadowed all other performances . Although some effect were at times  ""corny"" , Cerny's performance made up for it . It's a shame that  kids not in more movies !",960336000,2,454,4.244186046511628

689507,2,6303584845,"After Joshua's parents got killed, he joins the group of the children. He finds his friend and ""brother"" Eli, who is a young and agressiv member of the group. A little while later they get adopted by a couple in  chicago. Joshua gets at once the moste liked on, mostly cause he haven't  been very change by the children of the corn, and Joshua tryes even to get  to know other people. Eli dosnt like this at all. He spends most of his  time growing up a cornfield near his home. Nobody but Eli knows about it,  so he can help his dark powers, and he who wakes behind the rose alone.  After the field is big and powerfull he starts to get people to listen to  him, to make also them disiples of he who wakes behind the rose. With this  group of people Eli is going to change the youths of chicago, he hopes.  There is only one problem by this, Joshua dosn't want to help him  anymore.
As you can read, James D.R. Hickox has taken the story to the  city. That could be cool and scarey, but it isn't. The story is almost  boring, the specialefects get TO supernatural-if the story had been abit  more in contact with our world it might be ok-and you cant help crying over  the terible music. Not much of a movie. Can destroy the whole cotc series  for you if you're not a real fan.",957312000,,1278,4.159183673469387

URBAN HARVEST

You know after reviewing a few of these films in the series I decided I might as well finish them off. So I went back and watched parts three, four and five. Three as you may recall was the one that took place in the city instead of the country. Heck this film was even the debut of one Charlize Theron; she is one of the cult kids. After going back and watching this again I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It isn't my favorite but still it is good, better than I remembered.

The story follows two boys who are adopted by a Chicago couple after their father was killed, see previous films. So it is understandably awkward at first but as time goes by and the boys are still not adjusting things seem to be getting worse. That is until Josh, the older of the two, starts to make friends while Eli continues the business from back in the country. Eli has found an abandoned building in which to grow corn and worship He Who Walks behind the Rows.

This was the last of the series to go to theaters I believe, I really cant remember. But anyway writers Dode B. Levenson [Tripping the Rift] and Matt Greenberg [Prophecy 2, Halloween H2O, 1408] did a pretty good job here along with director James D.R. Hickox [Blood Surf, Sabertooth]. This film moves at good pace and has some creepy moments, but what horror film involving kids doesnt. Speaking of the kids in this film do a nice job with the acting as does the adults.

Towards the end things kinda fall off track but over all this is a good entry in the series. Any horror fan out there should check this out if they haven't yet. Not the best like I have said before but you can tell some care went into this entry. Not sure where I would rank it among the others but it is far from the worst.",1421712000,,1790,4.209912536443149

7851480,3,6303584845,"I really enjoyed the first film in this series, it captured the spirit of King's original tale, and did a good job of fleshing to short story into a full film.

The second film wasn't that great, but still enjoyable for the wheelchair attack scene if nothing else.

I wasn't sure what this third entry would bring, but my hopes weren't high. With that said, I actually myself really enjoying ""Urban Harvest"". Sometime after the events of the first two films, two brothers, Eli & Joshua, suffering under a drunken and abusive father, kill him in the cornfield. Now orphaned, the siblings are sent to foster care with a childless couple living in Chicago. Right away Joshua begins to make friends and adapt to a normal life, but Eli clings to He Who Walks Behind the Rows, even planting a small cornfield in an abandoned lot. Eli fears that he is losing Joshua, and begins to convert the kids at school to his corn religion, soon bringing a weird order to what was a rough inner city school. Eli's power over the children begins to grow, and it won't be long before blood is being spilled.

After two entries in Nebraska, I liked the fish-out-of-water vibe ""Urban Harvest"" has. And while I wouldn't say this movie is scary in the least, there are some pretty fun scenes sprinkled throughout, and I really liked the chemistry between Eli and Joshua, and how each reacted differently to their new surroundings.

Oh, and if you are hoping that ""Urban Harvest"" is to Charlize Theron what ""Leprechaun"" was to Jennifer Anniston, don't bother. She is in here, but only a minor background character that you see for about 30 seconds in total. With that said, I don't recommend you purchase ""Urban Harvest"" alone, there is a mega-pack with 6 of the Children of the Corn sequels packed together on a couple DVD's for about $5, pick that up instead.",1402272000,,1836,4.64
