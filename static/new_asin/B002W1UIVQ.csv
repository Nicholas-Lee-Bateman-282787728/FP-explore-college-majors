4003857,1,B002W1UIVQ,"Since Warner Bros. acquired Scooby Doo from Hannah Barbera, they have put out garbage like this movie Abracadabra Doo! I bought this movie yesterday from Best Buy, could only sit through 1/2 the movie then put it in the case and threw it in the garbage.  I am a HUGE Scooby Doo fan and this was horrible! I don't know what clowns Warner Bros. has writing and directing the Scooby Doo films now, but they need to go back to Hannah Barbera and ask for their help in bringing back the magic. It's obvious Warner is just in it for a quick buck, not quality.  Abracadabra, hocus pocus...make Warner Bros. executives vanish!",1266969600,2,618,4.508928571428571
4003858,4,B002W1UIVQ,"I've always been a fan of Scooby-Doo going back to the originals when I was a kid. This latest direct to video movie is one of the better efforts.
It's a great story. The Scooby gang comes to the aid of Velma's sister at her magic school, with a bit of a Harry Potter vibe. They are being terrorized by a giant Griffin which is one of the better monsters they have faced for some time. There is lot of good action and creepy locations in the manner of the best Scooby-Doo. There are some good humorous moments too, without stooping to the ridiculous sight gags and role playing bits from the earlier shows. Except for musical interludes, this movie plays the mystery pretty straight.

I like the interpersonal action going on in this movie. Fred and Daphne at first are close and clingy until Fred sets eyes on the magician's assistant. Daphne, now jealous, tries a bit of ballet to try to improve her grace and not be the ""danger prone"" one. Velma's sister has a crush on Shaggy who actually responds to her if in a limited way.

Matthew Lillard, who played Shaggy in the two live action movies (loved the first, liked the second) takes over for Casey Kasem as the voice of Shaggy. Though Kasem IS Shaggy, in the last few movies, his age came through in his voice work, making teen-age (early adult?) Shaggy sound kinda like grandpa. Lillard does a fine job here and would be a worthy successor to Kasem.

I'm a bit conflicted by the new animators. At times I thought it was great, while at times it looked to be too stylized. The Scooby gang seemed a bit too much of a representation of the characters instead of the kids we're familiar with. Unlike another reviewer, I preferred the ""What's New'"" animation to the earlier movies like the ""Witches Ghost"" era. While it was great animation, the core characters seemed to be changed too much. The later ones like ""Loch Ness"" (one of my favorites) while cartoony, seemed more like the originals. Just my opinion.

On one final note, keep the mysteries real. Keep away from the supernatural as much as possible. My favorite thing about Scooby-Doo is that it's always a man in a mask. If kids see that what they think is real might be something else underneath, they may just develop a bit of healthy skepticism.",1266364800,3,2259,4.529411764705882
4003859,5,B002W1UIVQ,"WOW! Colored me floored after decades of Scooby Doo remakes that never live up to the original Where Are You show this one hits it out of the ballpark! The creepy backgrounds, the eerie tension, the charming gang done justice, decent voice acting, amazing animation and shadow work! Very refreshing plot, nothing overly annoying just to appease 5 year olds, adults will love this too, quite intelligently done! I can see watching this dvd again. Highly recommend this dvd and please please please tell me there is more like this to come!!!",1266364800,2,539,4.869565217391305
4003860,4,B002W1UIVQ,"Scooby and those meddling kids are back on the case once again in this frightfully fun animated adventure from Warner Home Video.

Scooby and the gang take a trip to check up on Velma's younger sister, Madelyn, who's studying magic at a special school for stage magicans. Apperently the school is being haunted by a griffin, a  legendary creatre that's half lion, half eagle. Of course, as the mystery unfolds at Whirlen Merlin Magic Academy, not all is what it seems.

First off, let's talk animation. Instead of continuing using the animation from What's New Scooby Doo, WB decided to go with a new look, and quite simply, the animation is fantastic.  It has the same feel as the early Scooby movies{Scooby Doo on Zombie Island, Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost} with a ""retro"" twist to it. This is the best looking Scooby movie since Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase.

Speaking of retro,  Abracadabra-Doo takes Scooby back to basics here, right down to the mystery, and it works really well. The gang are dressed in their classic outfits., and their personalities are more in tune with Scooby Doo: Where Are You{though, not completely. For example, Fred's not a complete jerk like he was early on}.

Of course, no Scooby Doo movie would be complete without it's humor. Some of which involves Madelyn's crush on Shaggy. But I think the funniest parts in the movie come from the Mystery Machine's new ""G.P.S"" system. At one point in the movie, G,P,S proceeds to call Fred ""Scarf Boy"". Just think Robi the Robot from Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get A Clue!, except funnier.

I had alot of fun watching Abracadabra-Doo. With a good mystery, great looking animation, and some funny bits, This is the best animated Scooby movie in recent years. I would definitely recommend this to Scooby fans. 4/5.",1266278400,7,1789,4.766990291262136
4003861,5,B002W1UIVQ,"This movie is absolutely awesome! Twists, turns, even some scary jump scenes with a great storyline as well! A change in the animation style gave it a big screen feel with shadowing and excellent scenery. The addition of Mathew Lillard was also a GREAT addition, he really lives up to the challenge of giving LIFE to this iconic role. Sure it takes a minute to make the adjustment from Casey, but Mathew takes control and delivers an excellent performance. Looking forward to him in the upcoming series, although he doesn't take over until season 2. A GREAT fun-filled spooky Scooby trip worth taking for children of all ages! Get the popcorn and enjoy. Already looking forward to the next one!",1266192000,2,694,4.791666666666667
4003862,5,B002W1UIVQ,"Nice to see Scooby-Doo alive and well in this 2010 new movie.  The major change is that Matthew Lillard from the Scooby live action movies, fills in as the voice of Shaggy.  I always thought Matthew was the best of the characters of those somewhat bizarre movies, and here, he's more than adequate but no Casey Kasem.

The mystery: a flying half-lion, half-bird monster terrorizes a school for magicians where Velma's sister, who's got a crush on the Shagmeister, elicits the gang's help.  A little tension develops between Daphne and Fred over his goo-goo eyes for Whirlen Merlin the Magician's assistant.

It has all the traditional Scooby trappings- with lots of potential suspects, lots of like creepy, 'reepy' settings- a giant castle, a dark isolated forest, an island haunted by another monster, trap doors, towers, colorful artwork, Scooby and Shaggy silliness, a few tunes, and a mystery to solve.  We prefer solvable mysteries versus supernatural ones.

A cute cartoon plays during the opening credits of the feature cartoon (a novel idea) with a bouncy song that got the kiddoes dancing.

Our children, ages 3 & 6, loved it; although, we fast fowarded for the younger one, the extra spooky scenes on the 'ghostly' island, but overall the writers resolve it nicely for kids' sensiblities.  As adults, growing up with SD, we liked it a lot for what it is.  This one rates somewhere between ""Chillout Scooby and Where's my Mummy?"".  4-1/2*.",1266105600,11,1448,4.966804979253112

4003896,4,B002W1UIVQ,"Released in 2010, SCOOBY-DOO! ABRACADABRA-DOO is the fourteenth in the feature length Scooby-Doo cartoon series created specifically for the homemarket, and it is easily among the best.

The Scooby-Doo features are often at their best when they poke fun at popular entertainment, and ABRACADABRA riffs on the Harry Potter movies with a touch of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK thrown in for good measure.  On this go-round, Velmas mother sends the gang to the Whirlen Merlin Magic Academy: Velmas sister Madelyn is a student, and the school is being plagued by a monstrous griffith!  Thrown in a diabolical GPS, a lion, a slinky magicians assistant, a banshee, and a housekeeper named Mrs. Rumblebuns, and the result is unexpectedly creepy and surprisingly witty fun.

Casey Kasem voiced Shaggy from the characters creation to the feature SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE SAMURAI SWORD in 2009, when he retired due to failing health (he died in 2014.)  Matthew Lillard, who played Shaggy in the live action movies, steps seamlessly into the role, and the writers give several entertaining twists to the time-honored characters and formulas.  No one would accuse the series of being high art, but it is generally well-animated and well designed.  The youngest of the regular viewing crowd may be perturbed by some of the ghostly surprises in this title, so parents may want to do a preview, but even so, SCOOBY-DOO! ABRACADABRA-DOO is a kick-it title, lots of fun for old and new fans alike.

4003972,5,B002W1UIVQ,"Well, I don't know about magic, but there is one thing you can surely believe.  We've been treated to another fine flick in this enduring franchise.  Sure, the Fred/Daphne relationship was a bit forced on the viewers (where as it was more hinted at before), but I'm willing to look past that.  The film also shows how holograms and similar technologies have played such a big role in modern-day magic acts, something I'm not a big fan of.  This was never addressed, but I hope that the mere presence of the technology will cause others to think about this.  But apart from that, we got all the crazy, slapstick adventures that this pup and his fine humans are known for.  I particularly enjoyed Shaggy's ""wierd kid with the glasses"" line.  A great installment to a ever-lasting series.  Enjoy.",1401235200,,793,4.695652173913044

This film is very action-packed, but there isn't so much jumping around (unlike shows such as Sponge Bob), so I don't feeling like it's breeding ADHD in my child's brain. The colors are beautiful, too.

Another positive is that I feel like THIS Scooby Doo movie isn't quite as bad as objectifying the females as sex objects... it makes them seem more cute and endearing. I'm not that much of a feminist, but certain Scooby Doo movies are horrible about this...",1364774400,3,670,4.4471544715447155

Matthew Lillard is perfect as Shaggy. He was by far the best suited for his role in the live-action movies.

4004038,3,B002W1UIVQ,"Very quickly,  my favorites were ""Pirates Ahoy"" and ""Goblin King."" I really liked ""Zombie Island"" and ""Witches Ghost."" ""Legend of Vampire"" and ""Where's My Mummy"" were pretty good. ""Loch Ness Monster,"" ""Monster of Mexico,"" and ""Alien Invasion"" had their moments. ""Aloha Scooby Doo"" had some good moments. I didn't much like ""Cyber Chase"" or ""Chill Out.""

This 14th chapter of Scooby Doo is kind of in the middle. It doesn't quite have the chilling edge of ""Pirates Ahoy"" or ""The Goblin King."" But on the other hand, it's got a decent story, some memorable characters, an interesting twist, and some good moments of suspense.

Velma's sister is going to a magic school, and of course there are some problems scaring off the students. They of course borrowed some material from Harry Potter. But Shaggy makes comical use of that by not quite recalling his name: ""...and that English kid with the glasses.""

I'm sure many people miss Casey Kasem as Shaggy. But being fair, Matthew Lillard does the role as well as we can expect a new Shaggy to.

While there is some interesting material in that Daphne is jealous when another woman finds Fred attractive, the real strength of the story is that Velmah's sister finds Shaggy attractive and Shaggy has to overcome his 'lovable cowardly traits' to save her.

There is a fair amount of suspense and mystery, as well as tension. There's even an interesting twist end that makes it hard to dislike any of the characters.

4004043,1,B002W1UIVQ,"I miss when the monsters were real like in Scooby do and the curse of Zombie island, Scooby Doo and The Witch's Ghost, Scooby Doo and the alien invaders and even Scooby Doo and The Goblin King.  That's the only time Scooby Doo was ever interesting to me, when the monsters turn out to be real and they get creative with how the characters have to react to it.  The 'guy in a mask' routine was old back in the seventies.  It bored me. I wish they would do it with the monsters being real again.  It was popular in the eighties with The Thirteen ghosts of Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo and the Boo Brothers, Scooby Doo and the Ghoul School, and Scooby Doo and the Reluctant werewolf.  And it was popular again in the nineties with the slightly darker Witch's Ghost, Space Invaders, and Zombie Island.  I wish they would start remembering the formula is more interesting when the monsters and ghosts are real.",1284508800,3,899,4.418181818181818
4004044,5,B002W1UIVQ,"This movie is one of the best Scooby movies to come along in quite some time... and I think alot of that has to do with a great story.  The writers seemed to get back to the basics - back to what makes a great Scooby story: not overly obvious, not overly fantastic, a nice blend of humor, rooted in reality, but leaving you with a hint of a mysterious and supernatural vibe.  This is very much UNlike the last two movies, which were way too ""fantasy"".  It also felt like they had a firm grasp on the fact that their audience varies from 3 to 80 in age, and they needed to be sensitive to the way they blended ""too childish"" with ""too adult"".

The entire cast does a great job, and I personally really like Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.  No, he's not Casey Kasem... but to me, I think that's the point... that's why I like him.  With Casey passing the torch, I wouldn't want someone to come along and try to pretend he's Casey Kasem and try to duplicate him in a way that's completely transparent.  Because frankly, I don't think that's possible.  Instead, I want someone to bring themselves to the role, while still maintaining character integrity.  And to me, Matthew does this beautifully.  Casey Kasem should be proud of his successor, and I look forward to seeing Matthew grow more into the role as time goes on.

All in all, this movie represents exactly what I want a Scooby Doo movie to be.  I hope they stick to the formula they've developed here, because it works perfectly.",1283990400,4,1480,4.400735294117647
4004045,5,B002W1UIVQ,"A fun movie- typical Scooby Doo with some modern tech thrown into the mix. My 5 year old loved it!

4004046,4,B002W1UIVQ,"We own every thing related to this show and are huge fans.  This movie goes out of its way to let you know it will be a little different compared to other Scooby-Doo movies.  The beginning credits are cute with stylized versions of the gang.  It starts with them wrapping up a case at a chemical factory when Velma is called by her mom who is worried about her little sister.  They head off to a Magician School where she is studying.  The mystery involves a griffin.  While the story is good the voice of Shaggy as Mat Lillard instead of Casey Kasem is distracting.  My three kids kept saying, ""That is not Shaggy.""  ""Where is Shaggy.""  I too, found it distracting to not have the now familiar and comfortable voice of Mr Kasem there.  If he was there it would have been a five.  I don't understand the choice not to include him.  Too bad, really.",1272931200,2,848,4.3312101910828025

4004049,4,B002W1UIVQ,"First this was a great Scooby movie but two things. Matthew Lillard does not sound like Shaggy. I would have gotten Scott Innes who voiced Shaggy in some of the other movies, way better at doing casey casem. The Screaming Banshee was way to scary for kids. Some reviewers don't like that the gang is wearing there 1969 outfits and that daphnee is still clutzy etc...I wish they would stick to the original format, less supernatural more mystery...And bring back Scott Innes!!!",1272153600,,476,4.817073170731708
4004050,4,B002W1UIVQ,"Scooby-Doo:  Abracadabra Doo is gonna split the households because it's not what people in the lifelong fans or progressive Scooby camps will have in mind when they sit down to watch it.  Whether either camp is able to survive the changes remains to be seen, and the success of this movie may dictate the way future movies are made.

The most apparent change is the video appearance.  The art is a curious blend of old and new.  It's almost like the original art from the early television shows were somehow rendered against a 3-D background.  I found the art a little jarring and hard to get used to, and I kept noticing it instead of simply getting into the story.  However, I have to admit that the landscaping and settings were definitely creepy and attention getting.

Another visual oddity is that the dress and manners of the Scooby gang seem to have taken a step back.  Way back.  Fred's back in the annoying ascot, and the gang seem to have slipped back into their sniping ways and aren't necessarily happy with each other.

Still, several visual gags are in place, such as Scooby's efforts to prove that he was a trained performer when challenged by the castle keeper.  The fish swimming around inside the bowl on Scooby's head is pure fun for the kids.

One of the audio presentations has definitely been changed, and it's one that's going to get the most attention.  Casey Kassem, the longtime voice of Shaggy, is MIA in this one, folks, and he's been replaced by Shaggy screen star Matthew Lillard.  His voice screeches and wears thin, but a lot of fans seem to like the change.

Most of the people that watch the Scooby-Doo cartoons are kids and parents that remember the old cartoons, not the movies.  Imagine trying to get away with flatulence jokes and gags (pun intended) in the old cartoons.

And there are some visual shots that will jar parents, such as the first encounter with the griffin in the opening sequence.  We have a definite cartoon buttshot of the young woman following her cave exploring boyfriend, suggestively pointing out that there are other things to look at.

The opening sequences and changed music will set the tone for people to look out, that Scooby isn't going to be the same old thing.  Interestingly enough, the movie script was written by Alan Burnett and Paul Dini, both from the Batman Animated series, and by Misty Lee.  So maybe this was an honest attempt to retool the series into something fresher without losing the long-term audience.

I enjoyed the film a lot, but I'm not totally adverse to seeing old series get new treatments -- unless the new treatment totally blows.  Scooby-Doo:  Abracadabra Doo is an interesting story, and I liked seeing Velma's younger sister Madelyn, who isn't as together as her older sister.  Some of the traditional clue finding gets lost in the mix, but everything comes out in the end -- thanks to those meddling kids and that dog!",1271548800,,2920,4.68762278978389
4004051,5,B002W1UIVQ,"Why the heck isn't this released theatrically? The animation, the story, action, humor..it's all brilliant! I can't believe this is the same basic story-line as in the old Scooby Doo, Where Are You series (which I love, by the way) as it seems almost in the same league as Dreamworks and..dare I say it..Pixar, given the basic premise? The level of ambition here is staggering for a Scooby story, and I am at awe over the new direction one seem intent on pursuing.

From my sons point of view, he loved it from the start to the finish.  He loved the magic of the cartoon and how it had magic tricks and how the story line went with it in a 'harry potter' style castle. The cartoon filmed had him laughing and scared in places which I felt was good - as I felt that is the effect the cartoon film is meant to have.  To give the child joys and thrills - feeling apart of the cartoon film.  Like you are one of the characters. My son loves Scooby Doo and thinks this cartoon film is 'wicked' and that we watched it again straight after to make sure he didn't miss anything else.  It still had the same effects on him.  We would give this cartoon film 8/10 as my son says its scary, magical and the crew is on the case. We loved the ending as for once the person was just trying to do right and not con others and saying if it was not for these kids etc etc....  The man just wanted to do right.

4004082,2,B002W1UIVQ,"We own every Scooby Doo dvd you could ever find in the USA, my boys love them and my husband and I have grown to like them too.  I even admit to having the silly Scrappy Doo and horrible ""Hollywood"" and ""Arabian Nights"" movies.  The second this ""Abracadabra-Doo"" movie started and Shaggy spoke, my 4-year-old started crying - I rushed in and he said ""there's something wrong with Shaggy!"" ""his voice is bad, he must be sick!"" ...I also wanted to cry because this is the first movie in years without Casey Kasem as Shaggy and I actually had to explain to my child that this Shaggy's voice was like the live action movies (which my kids do not like very much), not the cartoons.  No offense to Matthew Lillard, but he does not sound like our beloved cartoon Shaggy and is not a good voice actor at all, especially compared to the amazing performances in other most recent scd movies (""Goblin King"", ""Samurai Sword"").  I again was in disbelief when the gang reverted back to the ""Where are You?"" series dress and degrading treatment toward one another - Daphne was back to being a silly clutz that Velma made fun of and had an argument with, Daphne called Fred ""scarf boy"", both girls were busy being jealous of someone else and the show was largely dominated by useless Shaggy and Scooby dialogue versus mystery solving fun or funny quips.  The best parts were great explosions, interesting ""ghost/monster"" designs and a good plot twist/happy ending.  But I also have to scold this one for the shameless advertisement of Bakugan Battle Brawler balls which, in key chain form, just happen to look exactly like the 5 dozen ""fireworks"" balls thrown at the monster by Shaggy and Scooby (sadly pathetic, do we need to meet Shaggy on the street corner late at night and slip him a few ones so he can get by these days?).

4004086,5,B002W1UIVQ,"Okay, first lets get through the hard part...I am a 37 year old man and I love Scooby Doo. There, I said it.

Being a Scooby Dooby, I enjoyed this movie, as I have all of the direct to DVD/Video movies that have come out. I also enjoyed the live action movies, including the direct to DVD one released last Fall.
I also thoroughly enjoyed the ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"" Series. I thought it was better than the classic 1969 ""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" series (there's something about the 1960-esque songs of ""sunlight and flowers"" in the 1969 series that rub me the wrong way)

 I have a crush on Daphne Blake. Sad. Yet, true. Man, what does that woman do to keep her youthful appearance? Find out what she uses and market it!

  This latest Scooby adventure is a magical (literally and figuratively) tale, where the gang gets to see, for the first time in a long time, Velma's Sister, Madelyn. Man that girl is high on Shaggy, isn't she?

  Anyhoo, the gang confronts the legendary, feared throughout the ages, Gryphon (also spelled ""Griffin"" depending on who is spelling it) a spine tingling monster that is half man-eating bird, and half lion.

  It is classic Scooby Doo. And what is great about Scooby Doo shows and movies is their familiarity....they never really change....drastically. And that is part of their appeal...you know what you're getting when you watch a Scooby Doo cartoon/movie: Fun, Scooby snacks,laughs, ""Zoinks"", ""Jinkies"", ""Run Raggy...Rits a Ronster"", etc, spooky monsters, and the ever-hungry Scooby Doo and Shaggy, always looking to go on a ""Burger Binge"", as long as they do it TOGETHER. I think it is touching to see these two best pals always sticking together through thick and thin. They love each other...a guy and his four legged best pal. That is awesome and sets a great example for kids to treat their four-legged friends as their best pals, and to stick together through thick and thin.

  Many have commented on the ""shadowy"" difference in this movie, and the ""non whites"" of the eyes. Personally, I prefer it without the shadows, because it's kind of distracting to look at the shadows. And I prefer to see the whites of the eyes...it gives the characters a soul. But as mentioned earlier, Scooby Doo never really changes....drastically, and that is what is great. These shows are like a familiar friend, or a familiar street, or a familiar favorite store, and that familiarity is comforting in this ever changing world.

 I hated the eyes in ""Scooby Doo and Shaggy Get a Clue"". It took away the Scooby and Shaggy we all know and love.
 But except for that rare instance, these characters stay the same: Scooby and Shaggy are still best pals. Daphne is still hot. Fred is still...well...Fred. Velma still masters rocket science, and they are all still one happy family.....a bunch of kids and a dog who are the wrenches in the machinery of the criminals. They are the good guys who save the day and have spooky fun doing it.

  The shows are a nice escape from religion, politics, and the store owner who just got held up.

  I hope that there will be many more of these direct to DVD movies.....keep 'em coming, and we scooby doobies will keep on coming back to the friends that we all feel like we know: Mystery Inc.

  Those meddling kids, and that dog.

P.S. Rumor has it, Cartoon Network is working on a new Scooby Doo cartoon series and a sequel to the live action film, released last Fall.

  Hopefully more direct to DVD movies are in store too.

4004087,2,B002W1UIVQ,"The mystery was the only good thing about the movie.  That was it.  My sister and I had to pull out the original to wash this movie out of our minds.

Scooby-Doo is supposed to be fun but this one isn't.  I endured ""Zombie Island,"" ""The Witch's Ghost,"" and ""Alien Invaders"" - but I don't watch them often because they don't feel like Scooby-Doo.  They're too dark, the villains are to threatening - and I'm not talking supernaturally.

I don't mind the supernatural in some of the Scooby movies.  A sense of wonder is as important as being skeptical.  Remarkably, Scooby-Doo has found a way to blend the two worlds into one.

Also, I can't buy anyone but Casey in the role of cartoon Shaggy.  Every time he spoke, I was pulled out of the cartoon, realizing the truth.

Daphne's regressed back into ""Danger prone"" Daphne instead of being the competent lady she is in the later movies and tv series.

But the constant agenda of pushing Fred and Daphne romantically kills me, making it less family friendly.  This movie, as well as ""The Mystery Begins"" is pushing my devotion to the limit. I watch the original to get in a Halloween mood and notice that Fred goes off more times with BOTH girls than he and Daphne do.  So, why isn't there a triangle?

Developing a romance between two of the main characters destroys the close friendship they all have.  Can you imagine what would happen should Fred and Daphne fight or break up?  Sides would be taken and it's good-bye Scooby Gang.

If they continue along this path, they will lose me.  Warner won't notice but it'll hurt me because I have loved Scooby-Doo since I was a child.",1268006400,,1625,4.52233676975945

After the absolute garbage that was the last two animated films (The Last Samurai and The Goblin King), I had very little hope that this was going to be any better.
Wow, were we pleasantly surprised!  This movie is a wonderful return to classic form for Scooby and the gang.  This is a real whodunnit, with several real suspects, and NO REAL MONSTERS!
And thank goodness for that.  I don't know what the folks at WB's were thinking, but the whole point of Scooby Doo is that the monsters aren't real, and you've got to figure out who's doing it, why, and how.  Otherwise, it's not Scooby Doo!
As others have said, the animation is slightly different than it has been in recent years, but I thought it looked more like the original animation than the more ""What's New""-era stuff.  The eyes are completely colored in skin tone, for example, with no white in them.  I really liked it.
Also mentioned was Matthew Lillard doing the voice of Shaggy.  No, it's not Casey Casem, but he does a fine job, better than anyone other than Casem that has tried.  And I found that after about 10 minutes of getting used to it, I stopped noticing every time Shaggy spoke.

Thank you, WB's, for getting back on the right track.  Now keep up the good work, and no more of these awful Goblin King-type movies!",1266969600,2,1417,4.436293436293436
