206140,4,555402128X,"After seeing HBO's disappointing ""Rat Pack"" movie, it was nice to encounter this four-part A&E documentary. Running nearly 3 1/2 hours, it traces the origins of the Rat Pack from the days of Bogart and Skinny D'Amato. The documentary contains a wealth of show-biz and political history, with rare footage of the 1960 Summit in Las Vegas and the star-studded Democratic fund-raiser organized by Frank Sinatra. The interviews with Keely Smith, Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis and Sonny King are particularly revealing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of archival interviews with Frank, Dean, Sammy, Peter and Joey. Danny Aiello's narration is OK, but could have used a little more pizzazz. For those who were not around during the Rat Pack's heyday, this DVD package is a valuable document of a bygone era.",1094428800,18,796,5.083969465648855
206141,4,555402128X,"As a young fan(21) of Frank, Dino and Sammy, I loved this buy.  It goes through the whole careers of each star on an easy to follow timeline.  It also provides interesting facts from the friends of the great entertainment superstars.",1074988800,9,233,4.658536585365853
206142,4,555402128X,The first three tapes are entertaining and informative. The forth sews up things too quickly and gives no information on the Pack the their later years. A fifth tape would have been excellent.,1032739200,8,192,4.848484848484849
206143,4,555402128X,"At slightly over 3 and one half hours, this two-disc set in a direct transfer from the A&E Biography series sans any commercials.  Each disc contains 2 episodes, in which you have a choice of playing both back to back, one at a time, or basic scene selection.  No frills here.
Narrated by Danny Aiello, this series delves deep into the lives and personalities of the four main Rat Pack players: Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Peter Lawford.  Very little is given on Joey Bishop (the 5th member).  Along with the rise and fall of these greats and all the troubles in between, we are also treated to some detailed background histories on Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis, and Frank Sinatra and Hollywood legend Ava Gardner (Frank's 2nd wife).  There's a bit to detail Peter Lawford's life and loves as well and how he gets wrapped up into the Kennedy family and a triangle with Frank.
This series is filled with rare footage highlighting many points (and again lows) in each of their careers, and there are many great stories told in interview style by Angie Dickinson, Tony Curtis, Milton Berle, singer Keely Smith and many other legendary singers and actors.  Mixed into these interviews are serious and sometimes comical stories on practical jokes, heated tensions, personal issues of the group and spotlights on others that traveled at times with the Rat Pack including mobster Sonny Dimato and Jimmy Durante.
The 4 episodes do their best to keep things chronological; however, (and for obvious reasons) do jump around from time to time only to paint a nice solid picture of a story that may span years.  The series in total seems to focus primarily on Sinatra, and interlaces his story with the others.
All in all an excellent series though Joey Bishop gets the short end of the stick in this biography, but really....it is about Frank, Dean, and Sammy isn't it?
However, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of any extras for a DVD.  When this show was being produced, you know A&E had tons of more footage, interviews, and information they had to edit out for a hour long episode.  With the amount of space on a DVD, they could have easily supplied a photo gallery, a snazzy interactive or animated menu, and I would have loved to seen some un-edited clips of some concerts or `Summit' highlights, but alas, A&E Biography opted to do just a direct transfer of the VHS episodes to DVD....a shame.  It would have been really nice if they included an episode of the Dean Martin show, or a Sinatra special or even filmographies of the Rat Pack players.",1028678400,82,2566,4.669623059866963
206144,5,555402128X,"Why A&E would devote the same length of time to a biography on The Rat Pack as they would to the Civil War, the American Mafia or the history of locomotive trains is beyond me - I'm just grateful & amazed that they did.  Clocking in at over 3 and 1/2 hours, this expansive insight into ""the greatest party in showbiz"" knows no bounds.  Intimately narrated by actor Danny Aiello, A&E dives deep into the history of America's first celebrity gang.  Covering everything from Sinatra's tortuous break-up from Hollywood sex siren Ava Gardner to Dean Martin's accidental alliance with comedian Jerry Lewis, this biography covers it all.  It is deftly composed, and never bores.
The first hour of the documentary shuttles back & forth between chronicling the rise of Las Vegas - the Rat Pack's playground, and the individual careers of each Rat Pack member.  A&E spends generous time on each member - the turbulent highs & lows of Frank Sinatra, the easy-does-it success of Dean Martin, the desperate ascension of actor Peter Lawford, and most importantly, the barrier-breaking accomplishments of the multi-talented Sammy Davis, Jr.  Only standup comic Joey Bishop is shy of biographical information (he is introduced much later in the documentary when Sinatra began assembling his ""summit"" crew).  As usual with A&E biographies, there is a wealth of rare footage here.  Utilizing countless film reels; summit performances, Peter Lawford sitcoms, Martin & Lewis television specials, etc.  You see a rare glimpse into the performing life of each member.
Also an A&E is custom is the absense of interviews with its biography subjects (everyone but Joey Bishop is dead anyway).  Instead, we rely on the funny memories of many Rat Pack insiders & biographers to fill in the details, even though we'll never really get to know about the late-night parties Sinatra held in Las Vegas.  Among its interviewees are Sammy Davis' mother, Rat Pack actors Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis and Angie Dickinson, as well as Rat Pack performers Sonny King, Keely Smith, Claude Trenier and Pat Cooper.  Milton Berle and Jerry Lewis also provide insights (Lewis is particularly candid about the nature of the public's reception to ""the Martin & Lewis magic"" - regretfully taking much credit for their audience's delight).  Other people interviewed include historians and even bartenders.  If you want to see the source of all the magic and are short of patience to settle on HBO's film of the same name, this is your ticket.",1010275200,59,2490,5.02676399026764
206145,5,555402128X,"This DVD set is a worthwhile investment for any fan. This is an informative and fun documentary that provides plenty of background, although is a little light on their years together. Not surprisingly, Frank & Dean receive the bulk of the spotlight, with only Joey Bishop possibly being slighted. This is a great introduction for new fans, and great fun for anyone who likes this great group of entertainers!",1009152000,10,408,4.927536231884058

7802474,5,555402128X,"Who exactly were the Rat Pack? How did that appellation come about? How did the whole gang come together? This is just the mere surface of this amazingly in-depth history/biography/entertainment piece. Intriguingly narrated by Danny Aiello, this comprehensive docu-tainment piece covers the tale in such marvelous depth that the deepest issues in American society, and in the world of entertainment, are uncovered in the process. Expecting a mild, superficial piece of fluff about an entertaining group of goof-offs, instead I got an intriguing, captivating, meticulously researched history/biography that taught me more about American history and sociology, as well as about the lives of celebrities, than I've learned in decades. Quite entertaining and enlightening. Quite recommended for all buffs of entertainment and of the hidden side of all things.",1445299200,,855,5.6875

7802480,5,555402128X,"THE RAT PACK is a four part Danny Aiello narrated A & E documentary that covers The Early Years, The Road to Vegas, The Summit and Camelot & Beyond. The five bad boys of this little band and their many hangers-on enjoyed a glamorous lifestyle for a full decade. They lived everyone's dreams, did so publicly, and were the envy of a generation.

Frank Sinatra was appointed Chairman of the original Hollywood Rat Pack by its founder, Humphrey Bogart. His first Hollywood association was with Peter Lawford when Frank arrived at MGM in 1944. At the time, Lawford was a star and Sinatra an unknown cinematic commodity. Peter was dating Ava Gardner and Frank took up with Lana Turner. Lawford and Sinatra had a falling out over Ava in '48 and their reationship was stormy for the next 20 years. Frank befriended Sammy Davis in 1947 when Sam was a teen member of the Will Mastin Trio. Sinatra met Dean Martin at Atlantic City around the same time; Dean never recognized Frank as his superior. All this and much more is covered in Part One.

It's a well-constructed program that contains numerous rare film clips plus commentary from many of the Pack's contemporaries.",1277856000,4,1162,4.719211822660099
