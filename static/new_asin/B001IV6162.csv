8311404,5,B001IV6162,"Wow! I have to admit, I don't think this DVD is quite worth the normal $2,999.99 price tag, but it's certainly worth every penny of the $1,658.74 discount price!  Thanks to this instant classic, I think I'm finally about ready to quit quoting Austin Powers and quote this film instead (""mmmm, cookies!"")!  I laughed out loud at least 9 times and thought to myself ""hey, that's funny"" at least 6 additional times.  Bottom line - if you've been living under a Rock and haven't seen this film yet - do yourself a favor and buy it while it's still on sale!",1417564800,2,552,4.445544554455446
8311405,5,B001IV6162,"Busdrive My Heart was made by first time filmmakers Dan Packer, Max Riesberg and Shane Zinkhon who decided to make a feature film while still acting as full time students at Indiana University. With little to no budget, they managed to come out with a film that is hilarious and very well made under the circumstances. Busdrive My Heart is an outrageous comedy about a college student named Scott who falls in love with a day camp busdriver named Amanda. Amanda's emotions are put to the test as she must decide whether her love for Scott is stronger than a promise she made to her dying grandmother. Hilarity ensues as their love is constantly being thwarted by Amanda's grotesque sister, her meddling parents, and the exboyfriend living in her own home.

It's great! You won't be disappointed. Busdrive THIS!",1224547200,2,810,4.827338129496403
