4470011,5,B004UQR6Y8,I had the pleasure of doing a live Masala Bhangra work in NYC last fall at a conference I went to. The video is great and was just like working out with her live. I am loving it and have put it as part of my routine. If I ever get invited to an Indian wedding I am sure to know some dance moves but jsut for a fun and different work out this is a great way to get you moving and sweating!,1348185600,3,388,3.630952380952381
4470012,4,B004UQR6Y8,"Going to an Indian wedding?  Dance around the ball room with confidence.

Sarina Jain's Hollywood Bollywood Style workout is an almost non-stop, energetic dancing with lots of arm movements.  Ms. Jain dances with five ladies in this intermediate workout.  You do need clear space, about the size of a small room, to move.  For the ladies,  a colorful scarf is optional for visual flair when you move the arms.  As Ms. Jain says, this workout will teach you moves if you are going to an Indian function.

Total workout time is about 50 minutes.
Warm up (6:43)
Section 1 (9:57)
Section 2 (9:35)
Section 3 (9:12)
Jam (9:06)
Cool down (5:34)

Warm up and cool down consists of dance moves and stretches.  Dancing steps are divided into three sections and all the moves are put together in the jam session.

Some moves are easier than others.  When I could not follow, I just moved my body around the floor.  If you want to learn the moves individually, there is a separate tutorial or breakdown.

Break down of moves (about 22 1/2 minutes)
1. Basic: tap forward with side arm movements and claps
2. Bhangra slide, hand behind ear: side stepping across the room with one hand behind the ear and the other arm extended
3. Power Bhangra, hand behind ear: little jumps with arm movements from the head
4. Bhangra fly: four taps, with wide arms and claps
5. Bhangra clap tap: three hops to each side with claps and arm swings
6. Bhangra four: side kicks to each side with claps and shuffle to the side with raised arm movements
7. Bollywood star: moves get a bit more complicated from this point
8. Basic with three claps
9. Three steps with bhangra fly
10. Bhangra 8
11. Bhangra circle with Punjabi boy
12. Bhangra squat
13. Bhangra stomp
14. Bollywood twist: upper body twist with arms

This package also comes with a separate CD which plays the Masala Bhangra theme song, which plays about 4 minutes, 24 seconds.",1324339200,18,1906,4.5811209439528024

DVD's and she is a ball of energy.  she knows her stuff and you will not only get a wonderful work out but learn some great new Bhangra combo's and steps.

Quality product and a must for every Bollywood dancer or person looking for a fun way to burn fat.,1409702400,2,396,4.0
8442010,3,B004UQR6Y8,"The Workout is fun, but the volume is TERRIBLE!!!  I have my television as loud as it will go and I can hardly hear the music or the instruction.  They need to redo this DVD, sound quality is horrible.",1407196800,2,201,4.128205128205129
8442011,2,B004UQR6Y8,"I bought this DVD because I enjoyed the 1 & to some extent even #2. But this DVD was a great disappointment. The moves are very fast and the same step is repeated over & over again, making the workout very boring. But I must say ""Hats off "" to Sarina Jain's energy . How she can keep on talking and dancing at the speed she does, it's truly commendable. I wish Sarina comes out with some more DVDs with some variations in the workout items.",1404259200,,440,4.127906976744186
8442012,5,B004UQR6Y8,Saw this routine on a fit TV program and have been l ooking for it. It wasn't out on video for a long time and now am glad it is.,1374451200,2,129,3.3333333333333335
8442013,4,B004UQR6Y8,Great workout but the volume is super low! I have to turn my volume up to the highest level to try to hear the music. Good fun workout.,1370563200,,135,3.857142857142857

8442016,5,B004UQR6Y8,"I am not a dancer or a gymnast and I don't have any type of coordination--and I love this workout! What I like most is that Sarina Jain is so encouraging. I feel like she's in my living room encouraging me to try the moves and keep going. It's just so much fun. I'm sure I look silly, but I don't care because I'm having fun while exercising. There are a few moves I just can't get down (lack of coordination), but I just keep moving and make up something. I really like that there is a break down of the moves. I did those before the workout and it helped so much.",1358208000,6,565,4.008849557522124
8442017,4,B004UQR6Y8,"I really wanted to like this workout, but it requires a lot of space, and I fear I'm not quite co-ordinated enough for some of the moves.",1357689600,,137,4.111111111111111
