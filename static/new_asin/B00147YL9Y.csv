8254686,5,B00147YL9Y,"Of course the only squeal to the Failure Is Not an Option (History Channel) series.

The interviews, original footage, and narration really was the best I've seen to date for the complete series of NASA maned missions. Especially if your into Mission Control.

I just wish I could get the first DVD to go with this, ASIN: B000KEVR2Q",1373241600,,332,4.706896551724138
8254687,5,B00147YL9Y,"""Beyond the Moon: Failure Is Not an Option 2"" is an excellent introduction to the world of NASA's mission controllers after the glory of the Apollo program faded. Certainly the Apollo-era team left mighty big shoes to fill, but this documentary discusses the transition to a twenty first century Mission Control, both in technology (goodbye MOCR, hello FCR,) and in the personnel plugging into those consoles.

Various missions are emphasized, each with a ""this could be the end of manned spaceflight if we don't get this right"" angle: that for me got tiresome. The things that pose the biggest threat to manned spaceflight are the fickleness of politicians and the NASA budget which has been chronically underfunded in recent decades. Nonetheless, the information on Skylab, ""Challenger,"" ""Columbia,"" and the Hubble fiasco is well presented and the interviews the filmmakers picked were extremely well selected.

I was happy to see the new controllers and Flight Directors (there's tons of them now compared to the Apollo era) interviewed, and I think their spirit and perspective are what we need to take leadership in space once again, if they can get a program that's actually funded correctly. Having said that, it was the interviews of the old hands that put the programs in perspective that I most enjoyed. Listening to guys like Gene Kranz, Gerry Griffin, Glynn Lunney, and Jay Greene discuss spaceflight makes this DVD a treasure.",1301443200,5,1439,5.1191489361702125
8254688,5,B00147YL9Y,The Beyond the Moon:Failure is not an Opyion 2 is really a great addition to the first DVD of Failure is not an Option.  The DVD was is great shape and I would recommend the seller to any friend of mine.,1245801600,,203,3.951219512195122
