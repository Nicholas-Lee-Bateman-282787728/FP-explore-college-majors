7951881,1,B00005QY94,"I too got suckered by this DVD having the description, cast list, and DVD details for the film starring Sid Haig and Gloria Hendry.  Even with all these reviews notifying them (which I didn't bother reading since the top of the page describes the film I want - and I know what it's about), and the merchandise returns, one would think Amazon might be bothered to do something about THEIR error..............seeing as how they just cost me the return postage to send this item back to them.

FIX THIS PAGE!!!!!!!!!!  >=(

7951882,1,B00005QY94,"According to the other reviews here, this is NOT the SAVAGE SISTERS movie starring Gloria Hendry.

It's a boxed set of 4 other movies, and one of them looks like a made-for-TV movie.  Not that the blaxploitation film sets a very high bar as far as production values go, but I can't think of a more useless product than a blaxploitation movie that's been made for TV, let alone edited for TV.

Either way, when SAVAGE SISTERS makes its way onto DVD, I wouldn't get too excited by that either.

Unless you want to see what would happen if you crossed a 1970s Blaxploitation Flick with a 1960s Beach Party Movie.

If you did, you'd have SAVAGE SISTERS.

What I mean by that is: John Ashley, who was usually Frankie Avalon's rival in the Beach movies, turns up here as...I'm not sure what.  An arms dealer, an ex-pat pimp with chubby harem girls--I'm not sure what he is, but he looks like a puffy, older Max Baer Jr.  And his name appears a few times in the credits, which makes sense of the Beach Party comic tones thrown in.  (Like the corrupt general S&M scenes and the medals he wears on his T-shirts under his shirt with medals).

And the lack of nudity--despite scene after scene of flirting and titillation--was definitely reminiscent of the endless skin and cleavage tease of the Beach movies.

The language and violence (and bad acting) are very Blaxploitation.  In fact, the lack of nudity felt very weird.

But it would not have shocked me if the lead revolutionary ended up being Erich Von Zipper, or if Deadhead appeared as a heroic CIA agent who swoops in to the save the day.  Or if Paul Lynde had appeared as the pirate-like captain of the escape boat at the end.

Now if they'd really carried out the genetic experiment that far, I would give this movie five stars.

As it is, it's a pretty horrible waste of time.",1121472000,9,1828,4.477341389728097
7951883,1,B00005QY94,"Whatever you do please use caution when ordering this DVD.  It is not the about the female revoltionaries that are released from prison hoping to find a million dollar prize on a deserted island.  Instead you'll get 4 movies!  The ONE movie is not released on DVD yet with the same name. This is very confusing since the release date is the same, 1974 and has the same exact title and some of the same actress.  This is an attempt to confuse and outright deceive and unsuspecting consumer.",1120608000,13,489,4.5227272727272725

TNT Jackson is a blaxploitation film about a woman kung-fu expert seeking revenge for her brother, killed while working for a Hong Kong heroin sydicate.  Poor quality transfer, and really fake fighting, but great fun.  Best fade-to-credits image ever.
Get Christy Love is network TV's response to the blaxploitation craze.  This is the pilot of a series that lasted a single season.  Black woman detective tries to make it in a white man's world.  It's ok.
Sister Street Fighter is a film in the great and hyper-violent Steet Fighter series starring Sonny Chiba (although this is not really part of the series, and does not have much Chiba).  Great film.
High Kicks is one of the worst movies ever made by mankind.  No, I am not kidding.  Starring a white woman that has nothing soul or savage about her.  An aerobics instructor gets raped and her new super-mullet karate-expert janitor and his buffed, shirtless and probably gay fellow karate guys beat up the greasy multi-racial gang.  Terrible production qualities, awful acting, pathetic, childish script.  No nudity, although lots of serious exploitation shots of women in spandex.  Listed at 85 minutes, but it feels much much longer.
And before you think you get no extras with this cheap disk, it includes a Casper the ghost cartoon.  Was I ever so young that this boring tripe was enjoyable?  No.
I recommend getting the TNT Jackson and Sister Street Fighter disks seperately instead of this - it ends up costing the same.",1023580800,11,1501,4.881422924901186
