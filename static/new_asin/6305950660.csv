1105380,4,6305950660,"This Republic B-pic is a cult noir film with a deserved following. It stars Brenda Marshall as a committed career woman in research chemistry who experiments on herself after hours to avoid the red tape at work. The experiment goes horribly wrong, leaving her face badly scarred. Her pretty lab assistant (Hillary Brooke) schemes to get her boss out of the way and marry the man that Marshall was putting off at the start of the film. The film follows Marshall's plastic surgeries and return to the same firm, where she figures out how the assistant managed to marry her former fiance. A subplot involves a woman she accidentally meets, whose identity she takes over in order to effect the deception. The whole thing is served up with a wicked twist at the end that I thought worked completely. The film proves you can do wonders on a low budget if you've got the script, right actors & director, and a lot of guts.",1144195200,3,915,4.585365853658536
1105381,2,6305950660,"This film was fairly interesting in parts, but the plot didn't make any sense.  Brenda Marshall plays an interesting person- a woman scientist- which was rare in the 1940's.  However, the film loses credibility when she has an accident and is disfigured.  She has plastic surgery and changes identities. However, she looks the same as she did before, but  no one seems to recognize her.  That particular item spoiled the movie for me.

Ruth Ford plays a tough blackmailer and Hillary Brooke portrays a really bad lady.  William Gargan is very ineffective as Brenda Marshall's love interest.  His usual vibrant personality is really subdued here.

Anthony Mann is the director and he does a credible job, but the writing is amateurish and the whole production looks very shoddy.

The print itself is pretty good and there is a certain film noir feeling to it.

I liked the fact that Brenda Marshall played an intelligent scientist and that the women had very strong roles, but the overall impression that I went away with was disappointment",1140480000,8,1039,4.913793103448276

1105383,1,6305950660,"A chemist (Brenda Marshall) working on a new anesthetic takes the product home and tries it out. Her assistant (Hilary Brooke), who may be after Marshalls' husband, arranges an ""accident"" that reults in Marshalls' face being disfigured. Marshall then murders a woman trying to blackmail her over a previous car accident and has to go on the lam with the dead womans' identity. She plots to take revenge and everything snowballs into a nightmare worse than before. The finale sees it all as just a weird hallucination she experienced from the drug. Huh? All this mumbo jumbo is played out in a very short running time. I wouldn't call this a ""movie"" so much as a cheap experimental student project. There are no production values at all. The sets are cardboard and the acting is dull and at times amateurish. I know that Anthony Mann has a reputation as a low budget film noirist but this is the cheapest attempt at telling a story I've seen in a while. Ulmer's ""Detour"" is pretty cheap but at least it's interesting. This was interesting at first but the ending just left me flat. Low budget is one thing but out and out cheap is another. I will not fault this films' defenders. To each his or her own. But it's just too cheap for me to see more than once. So it's recommended for Manns' fans and others with their curiosity meter turned WAY up.",1036713600,9,1345,4.539094650205762

Jealousy, murder, plastic surgery and revenge in a Hitchcockian tour de force from Director Anthony Mann (""El Cid,"" ""Desperate,"" ""Bamboo Blond,"" ""God's Little Acre"").

7899063,3,6305950660,"Genre: Romantic Thriller...Feel-good!? of the 1940's

Pros:
-Acting is passable (good B movie acting)
-Storyline is unique-ish and a little bazaar
-Has a good Pace (never drags)
-likable and hatable charcters

Cons:
-The ending is abrupt
-The ending is (although stated in the dialogue at the beginning of the movie) is a little bit counter to much of the tone

There was a lot I like about this movie.  The B acting was good and I enjoyed the characters.  So why only three stars?  Well my Cons explain it, the ending fell flat.  I have to admit that for the craziness of the storyline was well executed and I have to give my complements to the director.

7899068,3,6305950660,"When the DVD cover reads: ""Hell hath no fury as a woman scalded by acid"". You know you are in for ... um ... something different. And it is a tribute to director Anthony Mann, that he is able to take such outlandish material from Republic Pictures, and still make a watchable B-movie. Here is the plot:

Two medical scientists, William Gargan (Dr. Stephen Lindstrom) and Brenda Marshall (Nora Goodrich), are in love. But Hillary Brooke (Arline Cole), Nora's jealous lab partner, loves Lindstrom too. During an experiment using Nora's developmental anaesthetic (Nora is out cold), Arline sabotages the test and sends acid over Nora's face, disfiguring her. While Nora is in hospital, Arline sets events in motion to convince Lindstrom and Nora that the one doesn't love the other anymore.

Ruth Ford plays a drunken woman, named Jane Kuraski, who Nora had knocked down with her car on the way to the experiment (Kuraski was at fault). Kuraski is persuaded by a bystander that Marshall owes her $25,000 in damages ... [even though Kuraski has no injuries, and it was her fault.] Tired of waiting for the money, Kuraski gets a gun and attempts to rob Nora in her apartment. In a struggle, Kuraski falls to her death. Because Kuraski has Nora's identification on her, and because the woman lands on her head, everyone thinks it is Nora who has died.

Nora flees the scene with Kuraski's identification, and begins life anew as Jane Kuraski. During her plastic surgery, that removes the acid burn from her face (and apparently makes her look different, but she looks exactly the same). Nora reads that Arline has married Lindstrom. It is then that she figures out that she and Lindstrom have been duped. She dyes her hair and changes her hairstyle. Armed with this impregnable disguise, she re-enters the lives of Lindstrom and Arline, ironically, as Jane Kuraski, a ""friend"" of Nora Goodrich. Eventually, Nora confronts Arline with her real identity, and fights to regain Lindstrom.

This is an interesting film for Mann fans; you can see him developing some of the ideas he later uses to better effect. I would only recommend it to those who don't mind suspending their disbelief, as Nora's plastic surgery leaves her looking just like her old self, and she is apparently unrecognizable to everyone. In my opinion, it is a worthwhile effort, as the Robert Pittack cinematography is nicely done, and everyone turns in a good performance.
