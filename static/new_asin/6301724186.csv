7814294,5,6301724186,"A very good video.  I was able to repair a lot of years of dings to my boat with professional results.  The only hard part is matching the color of your gelcoat.  I had the glass guy at our local boat yard make me up about 1/2 qt. which was more than enough to do the job (about $25 for the gelcoat).  With a perfect match, no one could see where I had made the repairs.",1356048000,,370,3.8289473684210527
7814295,1,6301724186,"The people that made this are crooks. There is at the most,ten minutes of the most basic info. And that is so basic,almost anyone would know it by reading the label on a can of resin.all of the rest of this tape, is useless filler.  For instance, film says to use four different cut sandpapers to finish a small spot repair. What you get is the person showing how to put the paper in a sanding block, takes his time.  and he shows the whole dragging thing each time he goes to a different grit paper,yes four times,the whole video is like that. Amazon should take this junk off of their site.",1119398400,4,592,4.276785714285714
7814296,2,6301724186,"I was very dissapointed in this video.  There is little useful information on color matching, unless you own an off-white boat.  About half of the short (38 minutes) video you watch the author sanding on a boat hull, and stiring pigment into gelcoat.  I didn't pay [money] to learn how to sand and stir.  Several times the author refered to his gelcoat matching kit, and how you could order it from him.  Also, the video quality and directing is poor.  If I had known this, I would have saved myself some money.",1017100800,10,511,4.5
