205582,5,5558279494,"Tearjerker with strong moral values stressing commitment, faith and love.  What a joy to see a movie without being embarrassed about language, sexuality or violence.  Highly recommended!",1161388800,29,186,5.851851851851852
205583,3,5558279494,"Don't start this movie by selecting the first scene (select Play Movie from the main menu).  There is a large portion of the movie hidden in the introduction (approximately 1/7, I'm guessing).  This movie may have appeared to have more depth had the entire film been seen by me start to finish.  The introduction does provide a bit of character background and begins to build the relationship between Ben and Elizabeth.  That said, the simplicity of the movie allowed me to not get lost when not seeing the first portion of it.",1160956800,34,527,4.695652173913044
205584,3,5558279494,"It is ""The Notebook"" only not as well done as far as the storyline - BUT with morality.  So, if you're hardpressed to find a good Christian film, but don't mind a sub-par story, this one will do - but don't pay full price for it.

If you haven't seen the movie and don't want me to spoil the scenes, don't read further.  I thought the movie was too busy - too many stories, without all of them being fully developed.  My favorite scene was the one where Elizabeth sets the table for the romantic dinner with Will after the return of Ben.  It shows the commitment to her marriage, in spite of her painful loss.  It shows that real life bites you hard sometimes, but if you allow God to take your heart and mold you, He will enable you and it will be a reward in itself.  That said, the movie went more downhill from there for me.  It's a shame, because I think it could have gone the other way.  I didn't feel any emotional connection between the younger Elizabeth and Will and the older Elizabeth and Will.  It's like there are two - or three - different stories told through this film - of different people.  It's too disconnected.  Taking the same actors and applying a lot of make-up and whatever they do to make people look older would have helped a lot, rather than whole new actors that don't really look, feel, or sound like the younger adult characters.  In addition, you don't even get to know their son, so how do you feel the loss of anything to grieve.  There are not even a quick few scenes, perhaps with music playing in the background of their son's birth and the growing up years.  There's no emotional connection to their loss.  If they had done a better job of connecting the stories, this would have been a much better film.  That said, I loved the line where Will says, right before he dies, ""Thank you for chosing me.""  It points back to the scene where Elizabeth chose not only to stay married to Will, but to love Will and to pour her heart into her marriage, not lamenting what might have been.

The fact that this storyline was so close to the one of The Notebook made me wonder.  The dates of the copyrights of each book are three to four years apart (with The Notebook being published in 1996 and Though None Go With Me published in 2000).  Did Jerry Jenkins come up with the idea to make a ""clean"" sanitized version of The Notebook?",1160956800,8,2360,4.3061224489795915
205585,4,5558279494,"It may have to do with the fact that I watched this movie in the middle of the night, but I very much disagree with the previous review.  There was a bit of predictablity to this movie, but it was still very sweet and carried a great message.  It speaks the truth that just because you have faith and follow God things will not always be easy, but in the midst of hardship there is comfort and a chance to make a difference.  I found it to be uplifting and enjoyed it.  I even recommended it to others.",1157846400,201,502,4.091836734693878
205586,1,5558279494,"well, compare this movie to 'notebook' is simply too much. this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. deadbeat and simple-minded  storyline with such pretentious acting and unlikable casting.

my wife used to like this kinda movies, but after tried 30 minutes, she just told me that this movie was very bad and asked me to reject it from the dvd player. the screenplay was like written by a high school girl, so cliched and so tasteless. don't waste time in this one, rent 'notebook' instead.",1156723200,9,497,4.636363636363637

205637,1,5558279494,"This purported to be a faith-based movie.  I don't know, I just watched it because I got it for free and the cable was out.  In short, this is faith-lite if faith at all.  Main character talks about her commitment to God ""no matter what"" but little else in the movie suppports how she gets through her trials (not backing out of her commitment only?). Then she challenges God for all the rotten things HE did TO her and I personally don't believe God attacks us -- instead I believe He allows things to happen to us.

In any case, much of this story was absurd and implausible.  We are supposed to believe that her father (a strong Christian man) left his daughter homeless and pennyless???  We are supposed to believe in a small, tight-knit town that a young lady (flung to the streets by her father's death and financial irresponsibility) that the ONLY person she could live with was a single lad? In the early 50s?  Please!  Weak story line, marginal acting, silly things like her moving into the house with a guy and her old lady wig were just all too much for me.",1435017600,,1068,4.413265306122449

Tragedy strikes, and life does not turn out as she planned, but by following God's plan she ends up leading a life even bigger and more important than she ever hoped for.  Beautiful story- only flaw in it is the woman who plays the younger version of our heroine... she is not a very good actress. Cheryl Ladd as the older version is well  acted.",1410048000,,514,4.34375

205669,1,5558279494,"I see many of the positive reviews are for the main line of the movie, ""though none go with me, still I will follow"" and then some people also gave it good review for being a movie about following God. I did not like the movie at all. It did not have much scripture in it, maybe a line or two that's it. Bad things keep happening over and over to the main character but the story never goes into how she dealt with things or what she went through. It just blindly follows the I will follow God with no real depth. She has to so she does. Not sure how else to explain it. I have been moved more by other movies. I just wanted to review this as I bought the movie having never seen it before based off of the many 5 star reviews. Was expecting more from it.",1403136000,3,755,3.9411764705882355
205670,5,5558279494,"This movie was a sure winner for me because it's not our will but it's the Lord's will that should be done in our lives. I would recommend it to anyone who thinks that life is always peaches and cream but sometimes when we chose the Lord's will we will lose some people and some stuff. Like Job, "" though he slay me yet will I trust Him."" I recommend this movie to everyone in the body of Christ.",1401580800,,396,4.025316455696203

 The DVD has two shortcomings; no closed-captioning and the film isn't presented in its original aspect ratio. If it weren't for these, I would have given the DVD five stars.",1369180800,,572,4.737373737373737

This movie is a chick flick but my husband really enjoyed it too as he says it's not too much of a chick flick as 'Waiting to Exhale' or 'Steel Magnolias.'  It is such a beautifully written movie in the 1950's and her life's journey is so tragic however, the way she handles it with such dignity and grace with her faith sustaining her.  It's such a heartwarming movie and it will cause you (and your husband) to pause and think about the later years in our life's journey and how important it is to have our affairs in order.

She looses her father who she is real close to. There is also her next door neighbor who is in love with her. She meets the town's new minister who she quickly falls in love with and plan to marry, but he leaves for korea to do God's work. She receives letter that he has died in battle. She is heartbroken. After awhile her neighbor declares his love for her and they eventually marry. After being married for awhile she receives letter from her ex-fiance that he is still alive. She meets him and tells him she is now married. All these events alter Elizabeth life forever and tests not only her faith and inner strength, but her resilience as well.

205740,3,5558279494,"I do not recommend this movie for any Christians who is looking for wholesome and Christian spirited movies.

As I watched this movie, I was surprised and disappointed to see that the lady was never seen praying or confessing her faith with true conviction and  love for God and Christ...(except for a little blessing 15 minutes before the end of the movie).

Therefore, the characters lack of depth and inspiration. This is a depressing movie because little hope and love is proclaimed in Christ.

However real Christianity is how it is portrayed in this movie:
- shallow and passive, distant for a living  and loving God.
Real Christians do not take life's blows one after another with self pity, sadness neither. In the contrary, they put all their hope, love in God and find joy in Christ because if our faith is alive and strong, joy is abundant no matter what life is in a fallen world etc...
God does not test our faith using all infirmities that life brings...this is so wrong to use death, loss and grief as tests from God.

There are a few positive points:
The marriage portrayed, yet superficially, is solid and both characters grow in love for each others, faithful and caring for each others. They share the same faith.

I enjoyed the 50's settings and the decency of these times.
The female character has a beautiful character, despite the shallowness of what defines her faith, she has resilience and enduring courage but does her foundation lay on moving sands or on the firm and solid rock of salvation and faith in Our God and His Son?

it is for each Christians to appreciate and decide for themselves...",1363996800,2,1623,4.690140845070423

205745,2,5558279494,"I have some VERY SERIOUS misgivings about this movie. However, it can have value if viewed in the proper context and with proper follow-up discussion/critical thinking.

The Christianity portrayed is a VERY watered-down Christianity (Jesus I don't think is even mentioned) - it seems a very ""religious"" Christianity rather than a ""relationship"" Christianity - the main character seems to be ""committed"" to God in a religious sense since she made a commitment to Him and wants to keep that commitment, but she doesn't seem particularly close to Him at all and indeed seems to be very frustrated at Him because of all He has allowed in her life.

Which brings me to my really big beef with this movie:

This movie portrays God as someone distant up there that basically is just out to cause us pain. Through the main character's brushes with several tragedies, lots of questions about God's goodness are raised, but are never resolved in the movie. Basically you can easily come away with a view that God is a God that really doesn't care about our hurts - and almost that he ""delights"" in causing us pain to ""test us"" so we will trust Him more. That is NOT the God I know.

There is hurt and death in this world, but God is not out to kill everyone close to me just so He can ""test my faith"". Who wants to follow a God like that? Not me. And in the movie, you get the clear indication that the main character really doesn't either, but she is just forcing herself to persevere out of duty because of a religious commitment she made early in her life where she decided she wouldn't ""turn back"" from her decision to follow.

In reality, the deaths and tragic situations in the movie are merely a reflection of life in a fallen world, including our choices. For instance, the death of parents just happens because people do not live forever here - there is a time for us all. Yet, in the movie, the deaths don't come across this way as just something that happens, but rather comes across more that God ""has it out"" for the main character.

Another tragic situation that occurs centers around a relationship that gets jilted because (slight spoiler) one of the characters (a pastor) believes God is calling him to leave the main character (woman) and go overseas to war - this results in all sorts of hurt and pain and a terrible mix-up that has lifelong consequences. God gets blamed for this too. Yet, as I was watching this unfold, all I could think was it would be far more likely that the guy misheard God and his own choices caused this hurt. It's hard for me to envision God calling this pastor to do such a thing given what we've seen building before that with this woman. Again, it just doesn't mesh with the God I know, and indeed the result of what happens seems to prove that out. If it had really been God, it would have been a whole different outcome because God isn't out just to ""do us in"" and take away all our joy and any chance at happiness. It seems like the man's choices as a flawed human cause a cascading series of events that hurts all sorts of people (including himself) - and yet, God gets the blame.

And that's the problem. The net result is you walk away from this movie with the following message:

""There is a God. He does what He wants to do. He causes hurt and pain and kills people close to us to test us. We just need to keep persevering and trust Him anyway and do good for others.""

Which is really quite depressing and is why I have a very hard time recommending this movie. God is most definitely NOT portrayed as a God of love in this movie and indeed any real relationship with our God of love seems absent.

However, this movie is a very vivid portrayal of a life, with all its twists and turns, and yet a commitment to God remains. And we do see how God works with the events and choices that occur and does still ultimately work things out ""for the good"" in the main character's life. It's a ""case study"" of sorts of a life in motion and because this portrayal can be enlightening and cause consideration of how our choices affect others, I do feel there is some value in this movie and it can ultimately be an ""uplift"" if processed correctly. But I do believe it definitely requires ""processing"" - it warrants some very strong consideration and follow-up after-the-fact to make sure that you aren't wrongly internalizing the problematic messages stated above.

After you watch this movie, you want to go back and make sure that you go confess how Jesus loves you and is for you, NOT against you! A read of Romans 8 might be in order - even singing ""Jesus Loves Me"" might help... :)

I strongly suggest that you *NOT* watch this with children of any age or with new-in-the-faith believers. This is a movie more for spiritually-mature adults in the Lord that can appropriately strip out the problematic messages.

The acting and production quality of this film were just fine and the story is interesting and engaging (FYI: you WILL cry in this movie). Think ""good made-for-t.v. movie"" and that about sums up the quality-level.

You might recognize the name Jerry Jenkins from The Left Behind Series.  My wife and I have been fans since before that famous series.  And this movie adapted from Jerry Jenkins' novel by the same name does not disappoint.

It is the story of Elizabeth Leroy, a doctor's daughter, who wants out of a small town.  An associate minister comes to town and she is taken by him.  The story has twists and turns that test Elizabeth's faith severely.  Though None Go With Me's themes include enduring faith, a resilient spirit and love that lasts a lifetime.

205800,4,5558279494,"I thought this was a pretty good movie, although at times rather sombre due to the heartbreak the characters experience. If you like romantic films you will probably enjoy it as love is the main thread in the storyline which is slightly lacking otherwise. The main theme though is that life is not easy even for Christians.  We need to keep following God despite our difficulties and He will help us along the way.  The lyrics from the song, ""I Have Decided to Follow Jesus"" are quoted as encouragement for Elizabeth, the main character.

This story is also about a woman's love for two men and their love for her.  Her handsome childhood friend Will, has been secretly in love with her, but she thinks of him as just a brotherly type friend.  When the young and handsome pastor arrives and Elizabeth starts to fall in love with him, Will proposes.  However, the love between her and pastor Ben Phillips continues to grow. Their happiness is complicated by the Korean War and Ben's call to the ministry.  Will on the other hand continues to stand by Elizabeth through some very difficult times and tragedies.

Criticisms of the film: Unfortunately the make-up for the characters was very over done which I found distracting.  Also, aging Cheryl Ladd did not come across well on screen.  The older characters in the movie were the age of my parents and I thought they were trying to make her look way too old.  Instead they should have hired a different actress to play the part of the aging Elizabeth and had Ms. Ladd continue to play her as a middle aged woman as she did in the film as well.  Also, I was puzzled about the ring she took off being too big for her...again that was distracting. I don't know how close this is to the book as I've never read it and I've heard conflicting reports.

The two men in the film present a different type of support to Elizabeth.  My preference is for Will whose love is completely unconditional and he stands by her no matter what happens.  Ben is an encouragement to her in terms of her faith and what God is calling both of them to do.  The romantic scenes are very touching and rather heartbreaking at the same time.  Both men want only what's best for Elizabeth and truly love her which makes for a complicated love triangle!  The acting, particularly by David Noro&ntilde;a and Brad Rowe, was excellent and both are believable suitors for Elizabeth.

I'd recommend this film as I think it has a good message and it emphasizes the things that are important in life, but it does contain some imperfections that you need to overlook to fully enjoy it.  However, the idea of holding onto your faith through all the trials in life is a very good message.",1345334400,3,2696,4.542443064182194

I wish I would have had a box of Kleenex beside. I never cried so hard, so many times in my life. Perhaps because some of the events in this movie were identical to my own life. I don't know but, I absolutely loved the movie.

There's no room for the skeptical, cynical, over-analytical audience here.

In the end, the movie reminds us that no matter how bad these days can get, to hold fast to our hope, our faith, our what ever you call it. Don't give up. Because, the ending might be the best part of all, and it's worth sticking around for.

It's a reminder that all things work together for the good of those who love Him.

I'm really confused by the person who thought the author just wanted to make a clean version of the Notebook, they are not that similar. This movie if similar to any other I would say a clean version of Pearl Harbor. I mean in the Notebook Noah and Rachel McAdam's character still end up getting married and the only similarity is the time period and an alztimers spouse. In Pearl Harbor the leading lady believes her love to be killed in the war and marries someone else before finding out that he survived, but even then there were different circumstances behind that.

205858,4,5558279494,"This film is to be commended for its message: no matter what God brings into our lives, we are to faithfully follow him and trust His sovereignty.  The main character had her faith tested many times and she always chose to do right.

A secondary theme is faithfulness and fidelity in marriage.  This is in complete contradiction to modern Hollywood sensibilities about ""love"".  Very powerful message.

From a conservative Evangelical Christian viewpoint, however, the content of faith (salvation is in Christ alone) is absent--just the general non-offensive sense of God.  Christianity, according to the film, is not about the gospel and making disciples, but about social causes.  Furthermore, the faith and morals of the main characters were not passed on to their child and grandchild, who is in rebellion and running off (and presumably living with) a man who is not her husband.  This is disappointing, but all too frequent in second, third, and fourth generation Christianity.

From a cinematic standpoint, the acting isn't always the greatest and the granddaughter's interest and then lack of interest in her grandmother's tale doesn't seem realistic.

Again, the message is extremely powerful--well worth the time.",1212105600,8,1222,5.317708333333333

The story of a young woman with plans and dreams of her own, who yields her life to God, and in doing so instead trusts in His plan for her life.  Through trials and tribulations, hardships and heartaches, her faith, though questioned and tested at times, endures and upholds her, shaping not only her own life, but of those around her.

It's a story about life and love, faith and friendship, hope and humanity.  A movie that takes you through the whole gamut of the human experience.  Full of meaning and memorable moments, the strength of the story is such that it stays with you long after the closing credits.

Encouraging, edifying, and uplifting.  This is a story that speaks to the heart, strengthens the spirit, and nourishes the soul.

Guaranteed to make you cry.

Highly recommended for all!",1199491200,32,848,4.86013986013986
205863,1,5558279494,"I usually enjoy most romance movies, even ones most would consider sappy.  However, this has to be the first romance movie--based on a book--that had me absolutely bored to tears.  I kept thinking it would end any second, and then it just kept going, and going, and going.  I think if it had ended earlier, it might not have been so bad.

Also, when the grandmother was trying to get her granddaughter to stay, the story she told didn't seem to have any relation to the granddaughter's situation.  So, I don't know why she was telling it...

It was a very depressing movie.  One that sort of says, ""All God gives us is destruction, but keep on going anyway...""  I don't think God's like that.  He may give us strength to continue on despite circumstances, but He doesn't make bad things happen in our life.

I think perhaps the book might have been better (I've never read it).  If you haven't read the book, don't watch the movie.",1198713600,14,931,4.482142857142857

I was sorry to see a swear word in it...which I felt was totally uncalled for in the movie and just didn't fit. I just add that for those who prefer to buy movies without them.

205883,5,5558279494,"Written by acclaimed author Jerry Jenkins, I would highly recommend this movie. It's one of my favorite movies of all time and focuses on God and the importance of faith, even when it's difficult to maintain that faith.

Though None go With Me is a heartwarming family movie that focuses on what's important. It's well written and the actors and actresses did an excellent job. It is a touching movie that opens up discussion on God's plan for our lives and Jeremiah 29:11, grief, importance of sharing stories with younger generations, love, and selflessness.

We travel through the life of Elizabeth Leroy, who grows up in the 1950s in small town America. Through some triumphs, some heartbreaks, and some hardships, we watch as Elizabeth continues to follow and serve God.  By telling her story, can she persuade her wayward granddaughter that all she endured was worth it?

Part romance, part drama, there is nothing objectionable in this movie and I would recommend it for ages tween to adult.

The movie stayed true to the novel's themes and is a wonderful, uplifting story that refutes the idea that bad things never happen to Christians.

205885,4,5558279494,"Having read the book, the movie was predictably disappointing, and I am surprised that Jerry Jenkins would allow them to stray so far from the original story.  In addition, the book was based, very realistically in Three Rivers, Michigan...a small town of about 7800, where I've resided for more than sixty years. Of course, the movie doesn't mention the state (not that I heard anyway), and I suppose that was omitted to increase appeal for the general public. In any case, it definitely wasn't filmed here, and as a long time resident, I found that part sadly lacking. However, had I not read the book first, nor had any knowledge that the story was based in Three Rivers, Michigan, I would have given it five stars. It's a beautiful story, well done and well acted, heartwarming and uplifting, and illustrates perfectly, the inner peace and security derived through  a true walk with God.",1165017600,19,891,4.816993464052287
