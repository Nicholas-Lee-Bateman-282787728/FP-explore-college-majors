3001597,5,B000XCTD3K,"One of the problems with listening to sung music on the radio or on CD is that unless one knows the language and can understand the words one loses out on the total experience.  The composer has spent much time and effort trying to marry the music to the words; and that is often lost.

That is certainly not a problem with this DVD,  ""The Full Monteverdi"".  Not only are there subtitles, but the acting by the whole ensemble leaves one in no doubt as to what is going on:  the breaking-up of a relationship can be hell.

The language of the sixteenth century Italian poetry is admittedly flowery and florid, but when married to the music of Monteverdi it becomes a very intense emotional experience.  There are six couples (one singer and one actor) in a restaurant, in the throes of disintegrating relationships.  The couples do not interact with each other -- they have enough to contend with, but the singing is as an ensemble.  The camerawork and editing, along with the occasional flashback and outside scene add considerably to the excellent singing and acting.

I had the mistaken impression that madrigals were about fun and frolic.  Not so here.  The emotion is raw and intense.  But it feels true and it can be cathartic.  Who knows, it might also help hold a relationship together.

This is well worth experiencing.  Very highly recommended",1204070400,13,1352,4.713675213675214
3001598,5,B000XCTD3K,"This DVD should come with a warning: Dangerously raw emotional material inside! I felt so emotional after watching five minutes of this DVD I had to have a break. Yes, it is that powerful.

The DVD contains the enture 4th book of madrigal by Claudio Monteverdi, presented in a staged way. Sceptical? Have a look, my friend, and prepare to be astonished.

An intense, emotionally raw and uncompromising look at madrigals - how they work, what they're about, how they might be presented and how important the best are when we want to examine our emotions, motives and well being.

The Full Monteverdi is a film, as the editorial has suggested, and it depicts some very emotional moments between six couples in a modern restaurant. The film was directed by John La Bouchardire and Robert Hollingworth is the musical director of I Fagiolini.
Each member of I Fagiolini is paired with a non-singing actor:
Anna Crookes [soprano] + Pano Masti [actor]
Carys Lane [soprano] + Alan Mooney [actor]
Clare Wilkinson [mezzo-soprano] + Mark Denham [actor]
Nicholas Mulroy [tenor] + Katharine Peachey [actress]
Matthew Brook [baritone] + Anna Skye [actress]
Giles Underwood [bass] + Gina Peach [actress]

The film is based upon stage performances and this really shows - both the singers and actors bring a great depth of experience to each of the madrigals. Monteverdi almost certainly didn't intend the Quarto Libro to be performed as a cycle, but it works remarkably well and it is immensely satisfying to behold and hear. The near silence between each madrigal further charges the emotional atmosphere of this production. The whole thing is a triumph and a brilliant conception. I hope I Fagiolini is tempted to do something similar with other High Renaissance and Early Baroque works. I believe a DVD of the Balli from the Libro ottavo dei madrigali of Monteverdi is under consideration.

Anyway....

Buy, buy, buy!

You should, you know!

PS: I forgot to mention that there are no 'extras' [i.e. cast interviews or scenes behind the making of the film] on the DVD - just the film and some chapter, audio & subtitle options. However, the DVD booklet does contain a generous amount of information.",1203465600,9,2186,4.953551912568306

8228009,5,B000XCTD3K,"A brief review because I think the other reviews have covered what I wanted to say.

What I will add is that I have sung madrigals for the past 40 years and that has included quite a bit of Monteverdi. After watching/listening to The Full Monteverdi, I do not think I will ever sing again in the same bland way I have sung in the past.

This DVD is what my conductors were always trying to get us to do - sing from our hearts and souls. I will take a break for a while (to recover), then I will watch again and again and again.

Bravi!",1291075200,4,535,3.9813084112149535
8228010,5,B000XCTD3K,"Where love comes to die.

Several years ago I attempted to watch this film and couldn't make it to the first madrigal.  I'm not kidding.  Bored early this morning I decided to give it another shot and an entirely different reaction took place:  overwhelmed.  I've had a lifelong love of all things Monteverdi and the madrigal books were amongst the first works of his I fell for.  Hard.  The idea of setting Monteverdi's Fourth Book of Madrigals (complete) to a lip-synched film of modern couples breaking up in a posh London restaurant somehow just did not feel ""right."" This time through however, I got exactly what director John La Bouchardiere felt when he thought this a great idea for a short (hour long) film.

While it isn't necessary to have visualizations for Monteverdi's grand excursion into love and loss to make their point - the music and word settings make their point(s) beautifully sans pictures, La Bouchardiere nonetheless achieves something beautiful and manages to capture the heartbreak by sharing the breakups of six couples occuring simultaneously in a single night.

Through the use of changing camera lenses, lighting, filters and various techniques (most notably cineme verite) and brief flashback sequences, we see the couples loving and losing.  We see them on camping trips, christenings, post love making (discretely, no nudity here) and feel their sense of elation and doom - all of which somehow gracefully compliment Monteverdi's difficult, often stunning harmonizations and beautifully sung polyphony.  The richness of his a capella score, lays wide open the naked emotions with an often brutal power that LaBouchardiere captures with a sure and natural sense of timing, knowing where to place and leave his cameras, when to cut to a flashback, where to allow the reaction shots - all of it flowing in seamless rhythm with the music.

The vocal ensemble I Fagiolini, paired with silent actors make up the entire cast all of whom hold the hour long film together as if their lives depended upon it.  I Fagiolini approach the music powerfully and often full voiced as opposed to the delicacy frequently heard from many other early music groups.  The result is an often thrilling (and raw) soundscape of theatricality unique in this style of music.  The ""sighing"" quality so necessary in this music is not eliminated by such an approach but rather becomes a highlight because of the more complex dynamics and shadings of the ensemble.  They're simply wonderful.

I can imagine many (most?) might feel the same as I did when first trying to watch this, but - if you've got an hour and can open your heart to some of the most exquisite music ever written to being performed - to being the ""script"" for an oddly beautiful film, I strongly recommend this gem of a movie.",1279065600,2,2799,4.933901918976546
8228011,3,B000XCTD3K,"One of the earlier descriptions gives the plot hook. I might have tolerated this in real time in a live production, on video it feels like an exaggerated mismatch between suburban couples (dining in the big city) and the high artificiality (a positive trait) of the late Italian madrigal. Only pastoral and courtly men can be so pained, musically; the men in the film don't come off as ""sincere"" in a modern sense. There is a sort of slow unfolding of the backstories and the tensions, but I have yet to get to the end ... can take only about ten minutes at a time. This is a lot of pained and weepy madrigals back to back. Monteverdi was not pre-channeling Mahler.",1250726400,4,665,4.459016393442623
8228012,3,B000XCTD3K,"I could go either way on this staged version of Monteverdi's Fourth Book of Madrigals. I could say, sure, watch it once, just for the concept, especially if you've never quite captured the ""affect"" of late Renaissance poetry and music about love. Or I could say, avoid it at all costs, since the music is oddly truncated - polyphony stripped to one voice! - and the singing scarcely competes with what's available on CD from ensembles like La Venexiana and the Consort of Musicke. And the acting by the singers... either very impressive sincerity from people who really look like you and me, less than mannequin-perfect; or else unleavened dumpiness, cinema so close to verite that it's as false as reality TV.

In any case, I doubt that I'll watch it twice. Let that stand as my advice to rent it, not buy it, if you have an urge to see/hear an interesting experiment.",1220832000,7,869,4.642857142857143
8228013,5,B000XCTD3K,"The other two reviews of this dvd are excellent and very perceptive. I can't help adding my own two cents, partly because I love this performance and partly because I just finished writing a review for a professional journal.

Even though I had heard good things about the NY live performances, I was skeptical. How does one take polyphony -- even polyphony in which intimate individual feelings are paramount -- and create a theatrical piece, in which a sense of dialogue, of interaction, must be made visual? And how does one come up with a narrative? Book Four is not a madrigal cycle. (There are such things: a group of madrigals intentionally written with a longer narrative arc.)

WARNING: possible spoilers ahead. As the film begins, it is evening. Six pairs of twenty-first-century lovers meet (separately) in an upscale restaurant in some unnamed European city (much later in the film we realize it's London). One by one, the camera introduces us to them: they exchange endearments; they profess undying love; they quarrel; but no one says ""It's not you, it's me"" or ""I think we ought to start seeing other people""--this is florid, take-no-prisoners Italian love poetry. The couples part; they anguish; they make tortured love one last, exquisite time; finally, they separate for good, and in the cold morning light, we see those left behind having their meager breakfasts, alone, at the same restaurant.

One reason it works is that each couple is made up of one singer, one actor. The singers do all the pleading and recriminating, while the actors silently receive their partners' pleas. It's a stroke of theatrical genius. Because this is a film, we also get flashbacks that open up the visuals and provide context or background. Each individual's narrative is individualized just enough so that their heartache is believable.

There are no bonus features, but the included booklet offers helpful essays by director and music director, artist biographies, and Italian and English texts of all the madrigals.

Almost the only sounds heard in the film are the Monteverdi madrigals themselves. I Fagiolini, who enjoy a long familiarity with this repertoire, sing superbly. Their full-voiced vocal freedom, control, and ensemble precision are impeccable (imagine singing all these pieces without ever making eye contact with your fellow singers, or with a conductor). Their passion and musicality emerge intact as well. Buy it. It may be the most compelling music/theatre that you've heard/seen in years.",1205280000,7,2513,5.1495098039215685
