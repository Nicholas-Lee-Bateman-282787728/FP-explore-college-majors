4229026,1,B003YE7DKO,"There are a lot of wonderful Christian films.  This is not one.  First, I was disappointed in the lack of Christian message (Jesus Christ is the way).  Also, I try to instill ""the modesty"" issue in my girls.  The main character often wore low cut tops that the camera seemed to be well aware of.  There is a scene where the main character is sitting in her boss's home reading from the Bible.  The camera shows the Bible and the girl's low-cut top.  If you aren't one who cares about the whole modesty thing or you are accepting of today's fashion, then you won't have a problem with it.  I just know that I have been showing my children movies where the girl's are still cool while dressing fashionably and over time, I have come to see that my girls want to dress modestly now and they hate anything low-cut or short-cut.  Like I said, I know this isn't a issue for most; however, if this is an issue that God has been dealing with you and your family, then don't get this film.",1297641600,12,980,4.282608695652174
4229027,3,B003YE7DKO,"I really wanted to like this movie - I really did.  I bought it because I'm trying to buy more wholesome ""family friendly"" movies for my family, and it was recommended by the Dove Foundation.  While I thought the story was good, it was hard to get past the sub-par acting, directing, and overall low budget feel.

I try to give Christian Indy films like this a break because I know they usually have low budgets and limited resources.  But even I had to cringe a couple of times because of the acting and direction/production elements.

I rated it 3 stars because it's not all bad - the story itself is pretty good.  If you can overlook the shortcomings of this movie, then you will probably like the thought-provoking story.",1295568000,,725,4.538461538461538
4229028,5,B003YE7DKO,"I had a lot of fun watching this movie.  I saw places and people that I knew and it was a fun experience.  IMDB says the budget for this flick was extremely low.  It still looks nice.  Some the the dialogue is a little corny, but that just added to the experience in my opinion.

It's definitely got an independent feel to it.  You can really tell that that the 4 people who made it did most of the work themselves and really put their heart and soul into it.  Be sure to watch the gag reel, it's hilarious.

It's great to see Christians putting out good godly entertainment that the whole family can enjoy.  Mine really liked it and I'm sure yours will too!",1289347200,,658,4.2
4229029,5,B003YE7DKO,"This movie really is going to get you in your heart! True, budget was not in the highest range, but new Christian film companies have to start somewhere! Look to the MESSAGE here! Miracles exist. The best miracle is receiving Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior!",1285718400,3,263,4.617021276595745
4229030,1,B003YE7DKO,"I purchased this for my mother as a gift before viewing it myself,which I shouldn't have done. I thought since it was a Christian film she would enjoy it. She was extremely disappointed with it. I asked for it back and finally viewed it and saw why. The acting is not very believable, there are scenes where the main character is just walking with another character and there is no dialog. It's a bit choppy going from one scene to another. It doesn't feel like it flows very well. You feel like you are watching a home movie instead of a supposedly professionally made film.
There are better made Christian films out there, so I would not waste money on this one.",1282262400,,664,4.450819672131147

8409164,2,B003YE7DKO,"I really hate to say this, but this is just a stinker of a movie.  The script is awful.  The production quality is B-movie level.  And most of the acting is bad. The film's message is great, but, oh my goodness, that message is so horribly packaged that many people will turn off the movie without finishing it.  The movie drags horribly at times.  At one point there's an obvious film glitch where you see where a splice was done.  I just hate to say this about this movie because I was really looking forward to it, but it's just very poorly done.",1344297600,,549,4.281553398058253
