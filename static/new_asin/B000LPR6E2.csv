2711939,5,B000LPR6E2,"My 15 month old LOVES, LOVES, LOVES this video. She has several favorite parts and knows when they come in the video. The images of the kids, animals and animation are great and keep my daughter's attention, as you know can be difficult to do with a toddler. She loves Elmo, but has no interest in any other videos except this one. And mommy and daddy enjoy the video as well -- it is very well done. And we know this is a great way to teach her about God as well. We will certainly be adding other Praise Baby videos to the collection.",1183766400,,536,4.163461538461538
2711940,5,B000LPR6E2,"Great buy!  The music is soothing to babies and uplifting to the Mom at the same time.  The images of the other children and animals keep my 17 month's old attenion.  She enjoys watching them.  After using Baby Einstein for the past 15 months with my baby I was delighted to learn of a christian alternative.  God bless those who were inspired by God to create the Praise Baby Collection, Great work!!!!",1183248000,,403,4.541666666666667
2711941,4,B000LPR6E2,"This DVD was just as good as the others that came out before it.  It was refreshing to see new scenes.  My 2 year old loves the cartoon Elephant and asks for the Elephant worship when he wants to see the DVD.  It was nice that most of the taping was done outdoors and the special effects with the double images were catchy (at first I thought ""how many twins are in this new Praise Baby?"").  I do recommend it, I enjoyed it as much as my boys did.  Whether or not you have the previous Praise Baby DVDs, this one is a must.",1180137600,,523,3.9903846153846154

2711979,5,B000LPR6E2,"I heard of these DVD's from a friend and decided to order one or two!  They are amazing and much like the Einstein children's DVD's, capture and hold our babies attention like nothing else, with the added blessing of beautiful and uplifting praise music playing throughout.

2711981,5,B000LPR6E2,"I have four of these Praise Baby dvds along with all the cds.  I absolutely love them!  My baby suffered from severe reflux which made him very fussy early on and there were times when he refused to take his bottle.  As soon as I put on the dvd he would take his bottle and stop fussing!  Every time he hears the introductory tune he smiles with a HUGE grin!  I also love the fact that these dvd's are nourishing his sweet little soul!  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this series! :)",1395014400,,488,4.138297872340425

2712004,4,B000LPR6E2,"This is a sweet DVD for my babies to watch & listen to. I have no complaints generally except that all the worship songs are the type that do not mention the name of Jesus Christ. It is odd, and only an observation but there I've said my piece. Still I do enjoy this DVD in the mornings while making breakfast, as my daughters are playing in the living room. Starts the day well.",1386892800,3,379,4.135135135135135

2712007,5,B000LPR6E2,"Grandkids have several of Praise Baby videos, but this is the favorite by far.  All of the videos hold the attention of the one year old, but this one had the cousins in rapt attention, ages 5-6.  The animals were the favorite, but there was something for every child, even ballerinas. Wholesome and uplifting.",1381968000,,310,4.722222222222222

2712010,2,B000LPR6E2,This video is boring and doesn't seem very well made. I will not be buying more in this series. I wish I hadn't bought this.,1373932800,,124,4.0

2712034,4,B000LPR6E2,My son loves the Praise Baby series.  He loves the music and the graphics.  He has watched them for the past year and it was neat when he started to talking because he used the dvd as a slideshow to name the object/people appearing on the screen.  My godchildren also enjoy it and will sit and watch it.,1306627200,,303,4.189655172413793
2712035,5,B000LPR6E2,"The first one we bought was Praises & Smiles. They loved it so their gramma went out and bought ALL the other ones, of course. Lemme tell you as soon as they see the screen with the copyright info and then the picture of the 'big house' and the little jingle that goes with it, they both immediately turn their heads towards to tv and smile. They love every single one of these DVDs and I don't know what I would do without them. There's nothing else I've tried that's even close. Baby Faith is okay but doesn't make them smile and laugh like the Praise Baby series. My personal fave is My Fathers World and the Lullaby one. My least fave is the Christmas one. And it's something that can be played for the babies without driving the parents insane. The music is just lovely. So relaxing. Thank you and God Bless you, makers of Praise Baby.",1274140800,3,840,4.322784810126582

2712038,5,B000LPR6E2,"I WAS HESITANT AT FIRST ABOUT THIS VIDEO, BUT IT IS GREAT!
I we use it when we travel. It has upbeat praise music that isn't outdated. I find myself looking forward to hearing the music. A GOOD BUY FOR ANY CHILD ANY AGE",1238630400,,219,4.0
2712039,5,B000LPR6E2,These videos have allowed me to shower everday since my daughter was born!  :) She loves them and calms right down whenever I turn one on.  She'll sit contently through the whole thing and even laughs at parts of it.  I don't let her watch more than 30 minutes a day but those 30 minutes allow me to do things I need to do...every mom needs an occasional break.,1234828800,,361,4.202898550724638
2712040,3,B000LPR6E2,"My son really didn't care about these DVD's.  It's really easy going and relaxed sounding.  My son likes more upbeat music.  I wouldn't purchase these again. ""C-""  Like the songs though.",1230336000,,186,4.903225806451613
2712041,5,B000LPR6E2,"The Praise Baby Collection is fantastic for babies, children, and adults. The songs are not too ""babyish"", and are all together great worship songs. From 3 months old, my baby has recognized and loves certain songs. It is encouraging to see her ""worshipping"" at such an early age!",1226188800,,280,4.854166666666667
2712062,5,B000LPR6E2,"Great songs.  Well done.  My kids have enjoyed it.
 Sometimes I play this as background music even after the kids are asleep!  We love it.",1224201600,,138,4.4
2712063,5,B000LPR6E2,"I can't say enough good things about this DVD. We received it as a gift from my husbands co-worker. They have 4 kids so I figured they might know something and popped it in around the 3 month mark. My daughter is 7 months old now and she absolutely loves it. The music is great, it's one of the only ones that doesn't drive me nuts and I get some soothing Praise and Worship time inadvertantly. The images stay up just long enough to hold her attention and change before she gets bored. I love the diversity between children of all races and the animals and graphics. I don't want to be a big ""TV Mom"" but I don't feel guilty letting her watch this. She literally can't take her eyes off of it and grins and laughs, she can be sooo tired but will force herself to watch all of it and then crash. It's very mellow and calms her down when she's worked up. I never ever write or have written reviews, but this deserves it. WE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1222819200,,943,4.2154696132596685
2712064,4,B000LPR6E2,My 2 year old likes this one. She'd like it more if it had more pictures of babies and less of electronic shapes. The outdoor shots are nice and more mature than the first Praise Baby DVD we have. The songs are great and I like being able to change the voices or play without them.  The Praise Baby DVD's are the most requested by my kid - even over other cartoons or puppet type DVD's.,1207699200,,386,4.078947368421052
2712065,5,B000LPR6E2,My 10 month old loves this DVD.  Whenever she hears the DVD player come on she just sits there and waits for it to come on.  When it comes on she will just rock back and forth and just watch the DVD.  She just laughs & smiles whenever the children come on.  I would really recommond this DVD.  I just bought another one so I don't have to keep hearing the same one over and over.,1203292800,,379,3.9342105263157894
2712066,5,B000LPR6E2,"My just 2 year old daughter enjoys this video as much as the other two we have.  She will sit in front of the television and watch it more than once.  The scenes are visually interesting and the music is lovely to listen to.  I am pleased that she is starting to pick up the tunes of these contemporary Christian worship songs.
I highly recommend this product for a jump-start to your child's Christian music education!",1198972800,,419,4.4868421052631575
2712067,5,B000LPR6E2,"My son is 1 1/2 years old and he's been watching these videos for over a year. He loves Praise Baby. They are very similar to Baby Einstein, but instead of classical music they play worship songs. The songs aren't annoying and I actually enjoy the worship filling my house as he watches them. They are very calming too if he's in a cranky mood.",1198713600,,344,4.3076923076923075
2712068,5,B000LPR6E2,"My husband and I received this DVD as a baby shower gift and it is wonderful.  Our daughter is nearing 10 months of age and she's watched it since about 5 months.  Nothing holds her attention like this!  If I need to wash some dishes or take care of some other things, I can put her in front of the TV and she is absolutely mesmerized for the whole 30 minutes.  And I feel good knowing that she's hearing praise & worship music and seeing children moving around, being active.  Also, great colors and movement on the screen to grab her attention.  She recognizes the opening music and will instantly turn to watch it no matter what she's doing.",1192320000,,644,4.369747899159663
2712069,5,B000LPR6E2,"My eighth month old loves the Praise Baby Series and I do, too. He hasn't gotten into some of the other Baby Video series so far; but he loves the music on these. We were worried about too much TV, so we saved watching the videos for the 5 pm fussy time, while I'm cooking dinner. Now we've also found that they are a lifesaver for long drives or getting caught somewhere unexpected for too long. The music is great and the video of kids and animals are so great. My Father's World also focuses on children of different nationalities and has words that are teaching my little man about God. I highly recommend them.",1187827200,,615,4.356521739130435
2712070,5,B000LPR6E2,"My granddaughters love it.  We dance together.  They are the cutest at age 1 and 4.  We especially like ""Blessed Be the Name of the Lord.""  Good investment.",1185753600,,156,4.464285714285714

8163172,5,B000LPR6E2,"My 2 year old grandson loves this video.  I have brainy baby and have exposed him to baby Einstein.  This video has captivated his heart.  He sings along with the songs.  This is the type of video that I would play background for any daycare, preschool or sunday program for babies and toddlers.  Its such a beautiful introduction to the beauty of life and learning.  I thank the creators and wish I had this when I was raising my children.  It makes learning time so much more fun.  Everything is age appropriate.  He likes to play guessing games and counting with this video.  I love the entire series.",1489363200,,604,4.5092592592592595
8163173,5,B000LPR6E2,My child is addicted to this. I now have it on almost 8 hours a day in the background for her. She loves the music and images.,1487548800,,126,3.7037037037037037
8163174,5,B000LPR6E2,My two toddlers LOVE this DVD. It is so calming and the pictures of animals and nature really captivate their interest and attention. I highly recommend to families who enjoy having calming worshop music in their home.,1476144000,2,218,4.918918918918919

8163176,5,B000LPR6E2,"Praise Baby was a life-saver for me as a first time mom! I would use it to calm my little one down when nothing else seemed to work. I could put Praise Baby on and set him in the area of the TV (sometimes he didn't even need to see it) and he would settle down and just listen to the beautiful songs. You can choose from a woman singing, children singing or instrumental. It helped give a little variation to it. I love them all!",1461974400,3,429,4.0
