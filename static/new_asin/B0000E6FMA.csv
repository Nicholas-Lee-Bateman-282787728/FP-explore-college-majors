8002018,5,B0000E6FMA,"HELLBOUND (BOOK OF THE DEAD) is an excellent creeper w/ a fantastically dismal atmosphere of doom. The characters are believable, the plot is oldschool terrifying (think MONKEY'S PAW / PET SEMATARY), and the finale is a grabber! If you love black magic and / or things that won't stay dead, then this belongs on your shriek-shelf! I always watch this one w/ the lights out...",1307664000,,375,4.7846153846153845
8002019,1,B0000E6FMA,"I fell asleep during the first 20 minutes.  My nap was the highlight during this abomination.  Maybe I fell asleep hoping I'd have a nightmare; because the film surely didn't scare me.  I've seen many low-budget horror flicks but this one cuts the cake (no offense to this specialty dessert).  If you are a horror fan and even feel a moment compelled to watch this film, turn on your TV and watch the Weather Channel...you'll be much more entertained.  No joke.  I'm a horror buff.  I was horrified that this film had a price tag.  If someone gives it to you free-of-charge they are not your friend.  It's like slipping Ex-Lax into baked brownies.  Oh Sh--!.  Enough.  I'm the first to review this piece of junk...and hopefully the last to buy it.  Trust me...re-runs of ""Leave It To Beaver"" are more entertaining.",1250035200,3,814,4.647887323943662
