8650602,5,B000IFRROY,"This DVD contains two documentaries that are as honest and truthful as any combat film could ever be. Thunderhawks, the first film of two, is composed of actual combat scenes shot by the crew of the smokeship Pollution IV, and others. Amazing footage, great sound track and a great expose' about any day in the life of an assault helicopter company in Viet Nam. The second doco is Brian Wizard's return to Viet Nam 30 years later. Again, the truth is told, and if you ever asked, 'Did we win that war?' you'll see that in fact, the North won nothing, and the people are living the dream of freedom as best they can under a communist government.

The accompanying music video is good music in which selected combat footage portrays.

This video has NOT been discontinued and is readily available at Brian Wizard's website for the best price possible. Just search for Brian Wizard and you'll find it.

Enjoy, BW",1224892800,,909,4.633540372670807
