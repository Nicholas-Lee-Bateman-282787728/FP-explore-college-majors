8510332,5,B00753WZT4,"Black metal on Blu-Ray; really a first !!! For those unfamiliar with the band, they perform a blend of symphonic (albeit quite brutal) black metal with folkloric chinese elements and instruments, but don't worry, these are sparsely placed and not predominant so the brutality is far from compromised. They are well described by the saying : an iron fist in a silk glove. The performance is filmed with 5 cameras and fantastically edited so that at first you think the stage is a big indoor one somewhat recreating a chinese temple but in fact it's a tiny outdoor stage. They perform an (almost?) then-new complete conceptual album plus a lot of their hits in 10' shy the 2hr mark if we add the 5' videoclip comprised by alternate takes of the same song from this very one concert with studio audio on sync.

The performance is brutal and relentless, only bummer being the singer's endless in-between-songs banter in chinese. I was really impressed by their A Decade In The Throne dvd so I bought this one blindly and was equally impressed. These guys unleash hell on stage !!! I understand they sing about a variety of themes like chinese history, equal rights, animal rights etc, not satanic references. But all the vocals were in chinese and low in the mix, and if any of them were in English, I couldn't tell. Not that it mattered though. Guitar tone was homicidal, wire-thin trebley with just a tad of crunch thrown in for good measure. keyboards are there just not all the time; this is a GUITAR-driven band and that is the loudest part of the mix (luckily). Randy Blythe of Lamb Of God guests on vocals on no less than 2 songs and shines at it. It's funny to see him struggling with chinese phonetics during the reharsals on the bonus footage, but on-stage he confidently lays the vocals down stealing the show in the process and making the audience go crazy with joy.

Funny fact is the band's bassist is a hot chinese model by the name of Doris, and when they were off stage awaiting for the crowd to ask for an encore, all of the crowd began Do-ris Do-ris !!! Can't blame them, the gal is not only pretty but shows quite some flesh, esp a magnificent pair of legs, and she plays a massive 5-string ESP custom-made bass guitar. Gee, she's endorsed by the company and is at their website presenting her particular axe, the Doris Yeh ESP, very similar to Slayer's Tom Araya's with a slightly different tailpiece, purple color sheme and 5 as opposed to 4 strings and a 34fretboard instead of Tom's 35.

Pic : Good, but the bitrate could have been higher. 25 Gb for nearly 2hs when a BR disc can hold 50 ??!! C'mon !!! Why ??!!

Sound : very good stereo-only LPCM; not excellent. The mix is somewhat uneven; the double-pedal kickdrum passages are intrusive when they kick in and kind of buries the other elements in the mix. At first I thought my sub had to be lowered but turned out this sucked out the rest of the bottom end during the regular parts so in the end I decided to cope with it.  By track 10-11 overall volume gets louder yet (it's really loud to begin with) so I had to lower it a tad to prevent my head from exploding (was listening at a very high volume to begin with). Cymbals, esp. the treblier ones were a bit lacking, and my speakers are not exactly shy on that part of the spectrum; no big deal there and certainly attributable to the sky-high guitar tone and volume . Doris swaps her black axe for a 5-stringer and plays a lot of B-string notes so the sound does get fatter despite her playing the entire set with a pick.

Going for the new In-B dvd now so you'll soon se my review there. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!!!",1406678400,,3644,4.455772113943029
