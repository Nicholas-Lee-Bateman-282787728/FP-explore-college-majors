2641389,4,B000HT3Q2I,"This is perhaps the best season of the set...too bad it was the last. The only thing that I noticed, other than the theme song change, is that in the final episode, Sam leaps back to tell Beth that Al is still alive. In the background, ""Georgia On My Mind"" from Ray Charles IS playing. This is noteworthy because in the original Season 2 episode ""M.I.A."", the song was omitted. So what changed? How come the song could be used in the season 5 discs, but not in the original episode on Season 2? Is it because Ray Charles passed away between the two releases? Not sure, but the set is a definate must for any Quantum Leap fan.",1167782400,2,625,4.260504201680672
2641390,3,B000HT3Q2I,"To be fair, I just bought the set today, so I haven't had the chance to evaluate picture and sound quality on all the episodes, but I will have to vent about one little thing.

I realize I might just be about the only person who actually cares about stuff like this, but when shows began coming out on DVD, I had the expectation that we would get the shows exactly as they aired on network television, and at first, it seemed as though this actually was the case; original theme songs, unedited episodes, but as of late, it seems that distributors are getting a little lazy. In this case, my gripe isn't about the editing of episodes; these actually might be all the complete original edits, but my issue is with the sloppy job Universal did on the season five opening sequences. I realize it's not THAT important, but I'm a bit particular about wanting television on DVD to be as close to what we originally saw on network television as possible.

If you'll notice, every episode features the original, revamped season five theme song, but it does not run in time with the action in the pictures. I can also tell you that the ""J.F.K."" episode had a couple of different pictures in the original saga cell and opening. Why didn't they just leave the original openings alone? I don't understand why, when these shows are issued on DVD, they seem to pick one opening from each season, and tack it on every episode from that season; even when one or two of the episodes might have originally had a different mix of music, or a couple of alternate pictures.

I realize there are more important complaints when it comes to TV on DVD; such as music replacement and syndicated episodes being used, but this drains a little of the enjoyment for me.

This all being said, season five was a good way for the show to go out, and if all of these are the unedited episodes, this is still worth the purchase.",1167350400,5,1893,4.46242774566474
2641391,5,B000HT3Q2I,"We all seem to agree that we could have watched this show for a few more years and that the music on the DVDs is sub-par.  Considering all of the ""reality"" shows on TV now, a show this imaginative might never have had a chance, especially since there were so many references to God.

As for the ending--Sam did the only thing Sam could do--he laid down his life for his friend and saved Al.  What a guy!",1166486400,4,403,4.141025641025641
2641392,5,B000HT3Q2I,"Almost every TV show overstays its welcome and jumps the shark. ""Quantum Leap"" didn't and that's a rarity. The final season looks very good in its presentation on DVD and, while I haven't ploughed through every episode yet it appears that the music hasn't been replaced in the ones I've watched. There's also no notification about the music being replaced (as on the third and fourth season the second doesn't count because Universal hoodwinked everyone on that one). We also get an actual extra in this set--the blue prints for two sets in the show. You can actually zoom in on separate sections to view them.

This episode features a number of classic ones including the one where Sam encounters the ""Evil Leaper"" in a terrific two part episode. Also, Sam becomes ""the King"" (Elvis) just before he breaks through to the big time and in the most fascinating of the episodes written by Donald Bellasario Sam becomes Lee Harvey Oswald (played by character actor Willie Garson best known for ""Sex and the City""). Sam and Al struggle to find out why he's leaping in and out of Oswald throughout the time leading up to the assassination of Kennedy. Here's where a great extra could have been included by Universal as Bellasario actually knew Oswald and served in the military with him (an actor plays Bellasario recreating their first meeting).

Now for a bit of  bad news--we get the series once again on dual sided discs. Unlike some previous sets from Universal I haven't had a problem with these so far so maybe they've finally figured out how to make the darn things properly. Luckily these aren't packaged facing each other (like many of the Fox dual sided discs) but in individual slimline cases.

Unlike many fans of the series I disliked the resolution in the final episode of the fifth season and had hoped for something less open ended. It would have allowed a terrific TV movie to tie things up but unfortunately it never happened. I'm not going to say anything else for those who haven't seen the final episode. Some great guest stars during the fifth season--Neil Patrick Harris, Brooke Shields (even though I think she's a horrible actress normally she does a solid job here), Dr. Ruth, Terry Farrell, John Hillard, Michael Boatman, Stephen Root and a young Jennifer Aniston in one episode.

The show goes out in style with some of the best episodes of the series.",1163462400,69,2375,4.754854368932039
2641393,5,B000HT3Q2I,"This is the one I've been looking forward to the most! Although it has many episodes that have been panned for being laden with celebrity leaps (Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, JFK, etc.) and for having the silly Evil Leaper episodes (which I LOVED, by the way) overall, it is a fantastic season. The Trilogy eps are by FAR the highlight of the season. Also a neat thing about this season: we get to see more of the inner workings of Project Quantum Leap in ""Killin' Time"" and ""Lee Harvey Oswald"". The stories spend a lot of time at the physical Project Quantum Leap underground building in New Mexico in the ""future"" with Al and the person Sam has leapt into for reasons I won't go into so I don't spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen them yet. It's really fun getting to see what the room where the Leap-ees stay in looks like as well as other parts of the Project!

I highly recommend this season above any others, except for maybe the very short first season.

With that said, I of course have not watched any of them on the DVD because as of right now, it has not been released yet, so I can't review the DVD versions of the eps. On DVD releases of previous seasons, Universal has made several glaring changes to many very important episodes in the way of music/soundtrack songs which was VERY disappointing for HUGE long time QL fans like myself. I've heard that there will be no changes to the Elvis music since it is such an integral aspect of that particular episode. I really Really hope that there will be SOMETHING in the way of extras, which have been sorely lacking on previous seasons.

And just FYI: that Scott Bakula rumor about him returning to the small screen for a new QL series is just that -- a RUMOR. It is not fact; SB himself has repeatedly denied any involvement in any new series since the end of ST:Ent. IMDB.com has the series listed as In Development, but it's been in that status for literally YEARS and no stars are attached to appear. It's all rumor... for now.",1156982400,40,1991,4.419618528610354

I was shocked when my mother told me and my sister that we were watching ""reruns"" because the show aired on TV from 1989-1993!!!!! Who knew!!!! I thought I had stumbled onto something new! It is an amazing Sci-Fi Trip into the world of Time Travel. If you love The Back To The Future Trilogy, then you will love Quantum Leap. ""Putting right the things that Once went Wrong""!!!! How can you not love that!!!! The movies and Shows Today are missing that 80's sparkle and flair. Action,(minus the unnecessary violence)Good Actors, A positive message, and A good story line is all that is needed for a good successful Series and Movie. I can enjoy Quantum Leap anytime on Netflix Streaming Movies at Home Unlimited for 7.99 a month. There are a few episodes available only on DVD so I also use my Netflix in the mail service to watch those DVDs. This is a good way to see or get caught up on your favorite episodes so go to Netflix.com and get started. Amazon.com also has episodes available for .99 and can be watched instantly on your PC.

2641763,5,B000HT3Q2I,"Quantum Leap is by far one of the best TV series of the 80's and early 90's, and in my humble opinion, one of the better shows in the past 30 years. It managed, without gratuitous sex, nudity, or cursing to present a wonderful show that the whole family could watch, and tackled many issues head-on (racism, sexism, the Vietnam War, etc.) And the whole theme of the show--someone putting right what once went wrong--was perfect, and was very inspirational. In this 5th and final season, you get to see some of the best episodes of the series, and some of the most memorable. I have seen the comments by others on the final episode, and how it ended things abruptly, but I beg to differ. I thought it was a perfect wrap-up to a series that (thankfully) didn't try to overstay its welcome. Many other series have tried to push their lifespans to the point where they're not fresh anymore--but not Quantum Leap. Other series never get the chance to wrap up before they're cancelled (especially these days--how'd you like the endings to Joan Of Arcadia and Tru Calling? Oops, forgot--they didn't have one). Quantum Leap not only got to wrap things up, they did so in the most memorable of fashions. This is a gem of a series, and this final season is the sparkle in that gem.",1254441600,7,1271,4.530434782608696
2641764,5,B000HT3Q2I,"While there are still a few ""bad"" ideas here, overall this season pushed forward to its very satisfying conclusion.

The ""evil"" leaper idea was pretty good, but honestly, it fell flat. We have to suspend disbelief a little more than normal to accept its premise. That done, and by concentrating on the story that parallels in each of the episodes they're in, you get by and still enjoy the stories.

The concluding episode was a little enigmatic to me when I saw it on broadcast. Here I got to watch it with a bit more focus. It was still somewhat enigmatic - though I think that was by design - and even more enjoyable the second time around.

Even my girlfriend at the time of original broadcast loved this show. And she only kind of liked science fiction.",1254268800,2,758,4.478260869565218

Dean Stockwell and Scott Bakula were a wonderful team, the writing was usually very good, and there are so many ""cameo"" performances by actors who later went on to bigger, better things; fun to see them in their early carreers.

Please also do not order the British complete package, as you cannot play the final episode, according to several posters.  Get each season separately.  It adds up to about the same.

I started seeing Quantom Leap when I was about 14..
Every week this show literally saved me from deppression!
I just waited to see this show who brought Light to my life..
Sam & Al were my friends and true heros who'd Inspired me... :-)
They helped me in my hard times of life.
And Sam was my role model of a Good person!
I knew thagt this is how I wanted to live my own Life.
It felt in my heart that this is who I Am!

I purchsed all of the 5 seasons and watched it with my newly wed wife.
She also now adores this series and eagerly wait to see another episode!
I'm sad to think that soon ""my show"" will be over again..
since we started from the begining and soon we'll reach the end..
(we try to see just one episode each week..) :-)

I highly reccomend season 3 since Sam comes back home as a teen-
and also sings the wonderful song: ""Imagine"" to his sister.
For me it was the most touching episode of all.

Too bad the theme of the 5th season had changed a bit.
And actually it's my least favourite- but still worth every penny!!
I hope for one day to be able to Thank personally to all of the team,
All the people who made Quantom Leap dream possible..
Donald P. Bellisario, Scott Bakula, Dean Stockwell, Deborah Pratt..
and all of the wonderful Family of Angels who made me tear out of joy,
of appriciation and deaply from a heart filled with Love!

Thank you! Thank you very much!
You Have truly Changed the World! :-)
Certainly you've changed me & my wife..
and we'll try to help others as well.. :-)

Another show I recommened and hope that will reach Amazon-
is called: ""Early Edition"" about a guy who recieves tommorrow's newspaper-
and tries each day to save whoever he can... (sounds familiar huh?)

So all the people here who had seconds thoughts- Don't!
It's for your future- as well as your kids, friends & loved ones!
Keep this flame alive for many generations to come! :-)
