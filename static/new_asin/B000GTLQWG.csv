Cedric the Entertainer is one of the greatest comedians of our time. He ads a little dancing in there, and we all know he likes to dance. But all around it was a good show.",1192665600,,285,3.9310344827586206

2618152,5,B000GTLQWG,Cedric made a good comeback with this stand up routine. I mean this show is absolutely hilarious. Sort of reminds me of when he was on  def comedy jam.
