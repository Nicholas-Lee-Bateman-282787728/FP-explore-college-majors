8322357,2,B001MWUWT4,"After a brutally bad premiere episode BLOOD VISIONS, ANGELS & DEMONS restores a measure of hope for the rescuscitation of A HAUNTING from its five year coma. While still plagued by bad writing and hyperactive CGI that undercuts atmosphere, the problems were not severe enough to obscure an interesting story. More substantive and animated, the interview clips meshed well among the narration and character re-enactment as compared to BLOOD VISIONS, where it felt more perfunctory -- more forced into a template.

The use of special effects, while obnoxious in transitioning between scenes (and during the climactic exorcism), were executed effectively in portraying the movement of the back-pack and the sleeptalking of the acutely possessed son, whose verbal regurgitation of an argument he was not present to hear had struck that first vital stranger-than-fiction note of the season. (The strength of the series has always been the depiction of events that parodoxically strain and support credibility in that they seem unlikely inventions of the imagination).

The program however continues to suffer from writing problems, particularly in the area of dialog. This was evidenced in Karen Carbone, whose acting skills I would have deemed gag-worthy if she had not come off so well as Jan Foster in the Season 2 episode DEMON CHILD. And the writer is not giving narrator Tony Call anything to work with. His lines are dreadfully on-the-nose. While words like ""the shocking answer would come all too soon"" fit seamlessly and added to the suspense of season 1 episode ECHOES FROM THE GRAVE, the line ""little did she know it would become her worst nightmare"" struck me as juvenile and like the interview from BLOOD VISIONS, formulaic. As in BLOOD VISIONS, the narration contributed little of value, telling us either what we already knew, what was unfolding before our eyes, or did not need to know. In BLOOD VISIONS, when the possessed teen hears the disembodied voice of the demon -- ""Die Now"" -- the voice of Tony Call
reminding us that it was ""the same phrase written on the bathroom mirror"" only blunted its impact and prompted my wife to ask, ""how stupid does this program think we are?"" At the end of ANGELS & DEMONS, a new individual is introduced in an interview clip that had my wife and I simultaneously asking one another: ""Who is this woman?"" We were able to determine it was the friend and Tarot card reader, but the lack of set-up made for an odd moment that disrupted the flow. Building a quality program begins from the ground up or the inside out, to borrow some clichd metaphors and that means greater emphasis on writing. Writing. Writing. Writing.",1350691200,,2666,4.961968680089486
