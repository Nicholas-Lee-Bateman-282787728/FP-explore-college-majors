2906574,5,B000TLTCOK,"I've loved this great western series since it's debut in 1965. The show boasted a fabulous cast which had incredible chemistry, great scripts,terrific music, and an abundance of good old fashioned fun.

2906577,4,B000TLTCOK,"Yahoo! The Texas Rangers are back.

What made ""Laredo"" unique in the annals of tv westerns was its unique blend of humor and action. 'Reese Bennett' (Neville Brand), 'Chad Cooper(Peter Brown),and 'Joe Riley' (William Smith) were a likeable trio of Texas Rangers who may have been a little rough around the edges, but always managed to get the job done in the end.

""Laredo"" was actually a spin-off of ""The Virginian."" The characters were featured with 'Trampas' in the episode ""We've Lost a Train.""

The transfer quality of the episodes is very good to excellent. If you are an aficionado of  classic tv westerns, this dvd set will be a great addition to your collection.

I noticed an NBC/Universal logo on the dvd which seems to indicate this compilation was done with the company's backing. If that's the case, let's hope we'll see the release of other NBC classic westerns such as the aforementioned ""The Virginian,""  and ""The High Chaparral.""",1194825600,46,947,4.8875

2906579,5,B000TLTCOK,The show was juast as I remember it - ;ight comedy  mixed with a little serious drama.,1410480000,,86,4.0588235294117645
2906580,4,B000TLTCOK,very cool,1409356800,,9,4.0
2906581,4,B000TLTCOK,"One of my all-time favorites.  I like how they auto-run the opening credits and then pause at the menu for the individual episodes.  You can stick it in the player, go grab a beer and it will be waiting for your selection when you settle in and don't have to watch the opening over and over again.  Like others, I do wish they were in chronological order or maybe some documentation on original air date.",1402617600,,404,4.36
2906582,5,B000TLTCOK,"I ordered this by accident.  When I started watching it, I really got into the show.  However, I was horrified to see the way Native Americans were portrayed in the show.  Yikes!  It was rather touchy in terms of Hispanics, too.  But aside from that (I tried to recognize those failings were a sign of the times), I really enjoyed the show.",1401580800,2,340,4.419354838709677
2906583,1,B000TLTCOK,Should've been called a TV sampler of the series. Only 4 episodes. I was fooled into believing it was the first half of season and at least 12 episodes.,1394323200,,152,4.275862068965517
2906584,5,B000TLTCOK,Great classic of the TV show (I had forgotten about )  and has a flare of adventure as well as comedy,1386720000,,101,3.8095238095238093
2906585,5,B000TLTCOK,great western to watch on dvd  and all about the texas rangers  like the whole dvd to watch over and over,1376697600,,105,3.9523809523809526
2906586,4,B000TLTCOK,Laredo is a funny western and kind of in the same theme as an early Bonanza.  Enjoyed it very much.  Picture quality is very good.  I would recommend for a light-hearted show.,1329782400,,175,4.40625
2906587,3,B000TLTCOK,I thought that this was the complete season one of Laredo. I must have miss read it.  I was dissapointed in the selection of the episodes selected as 'the best'.  None of my favorite episodes with Linda Little Trees and Blue Dog were there.  Other than this I enjoyed watching Laredo again.,1305244800,3,290,4.538461538461538
2906588,5,B000TLTCOK,"I enjoyed watching this show.  It was sad that it was cancelled after just two years.  The network kept moving it around which could be certain death of a tv show.  The network and the producers of the show could not agree on when to schedule the show and the network ended in canceling it.  It was a very good show and it was very unfair for the network to do that.  I was unable to get the complete series from Amazon.  I ordered all of what they had, but I was still missing 9 shows.  I had to order the complete series in order to get every thing.",1304467200,,551,4.0
2906589,1,B000TLTCOK,"This is not Season One, Part One.  It is The Best of Laredo, Season One. If you want to have the entire season, you have to order the 3 DVD set, entitled ""Laredo, Season One, Part One.""  Unfortuneately the title of the 3 DVD set contains ""Best of..."", which isn't correct either.  However the production is excellent.  You just have to be sure you're ordering the right product.",1245628800,7,378,4.514705882352941
2906590,5,B000TLTCOK,"I'm making this short as others have given their reviews.  A good quality product, actually first of two DVD sets which, I understand, total almost the entire first season.  It is fun to watch the great shows again.  They are just as I remembered them.  Go with the ""Best of..."" series from Amazon--best bang for the buck.",1243209600,,322,4.5964912280701755
2906591,2,B000TLTCOK,"I loved this series in my youth; but, alas I find that as an adult - this TV show was so goofy that I'll probably never finish watching the episodes. It's hard to believe that we loved this so much in the 60's.",1240617600,,210,3.9069767441860463
2906592,3,B000TLTCOK,"This is NOT Season One, Part One as the heading would lead you to believe.  It is Laredo, Best of Season One.
It's good, but not if you're looking for the entire season.
I had ordered this with Season One, Part Two; Season Two, Parts One & Two and was quite dissapointed.",1239235200,8,271,4.211538461538462
2906593,2,B000TLTCOK,"IF you were not familiar with this TV series, you wouldn't know what show this is! There is no Title Screen that says ""Laredo"" - Obviously CUT!
DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIP OFF!",1234915200,,181,5.066666666666666
2906594,5,B000TLTCOK,"I remember watching these shows with my brothers. late at night. I enjoyed them thoroughy and you will also. Laredo combined action and humor with the focus on three fictitious Texas Rangers. Reese Bennett, played by Brand, is older than his two partners. Chad Cooper was played by Peter Brown, the former co-star of NBC's Lawman. Joe Riley was portrayed by William Smith. Reese was previously an officer of the Union Army during the American Civil War. Originally from New Orleans, Chad was in the Border Patrol during the war. He joined the Rangers to search for the gunrunners who had ambushed fellow border patrolmen. Joe was a gunfighter who was at times on the wrong side of the law. He joined the Rangers to obtain protection from a sheriff. Chad and Joe tease Reese about his age: he was in his forties.

The three Rangers are led by Captain Edward Parmalee, played by Philip Carey, who was stern and disciplined. Robert Wolders as Erik Hunter joined the show in the second and final season. Claude Akins played Ranger Cotton Buckmeister in five episodes but never became a part of the cast. The pilot of Laredo was an episode of The Virginian called ""We've Lost A Train"", which was broadcast in April 1965. It was released theatrically in 1969 under the title Backtrack.

Reese's horse Cactus is mentioned in several episodes. Chad's horse called ""Amigo"" was actually Peter Brown's personal horse.

Three of the episodes from the first season of the series were edited into the feature film Three Guns for Texas",1227484800,2,1520,4.793893129770993
2906595,1,B000TLTCOK,"Yes, I think that more care must be taken in the production of these DVD transfers. The cast of ""Laredo"" and the fans are done an injustice when this happens. The cast was great, especially Neville Brand. However, where is that fine old series ""Lawman"" starring John Russell and Peter Brown (Brown did ""Lawman"" before ""Laredo""). Of course, if Warner Brothers--I think that they own the rights--does a really bad job on the production of the ""Lawman"" DVD--don't even bother. For instance, if they leave out the song:""The Lawman came with the sun...There was a job to be done..."", etc. Leaving the song out alters the impact of the series. I just purchased ""William Tell"" and the original song ""Marching behind William Tell we rebel in a cause that is just..."" was no where to be found. Apparently, they used the song that was employed for the British release. I hope future releases correct the omission. It may seem trivial, but these things are important to fans who grew up with these shows! ""Laredo"" had glaring defects per the production values of the DVD; I hope that more care is taken next time.",1226016000,,1102,4.715025906735751
2906596,2,B000TLTCOK,"I purchased this set because of the good reviews.  I guess I should know better because 95% of Amazon reviews are worthless.  It would of been nice if someone had mentioned the opening credits were missing from all the episodes.  They only show them once with the menu.  For that reason only, I cannot recommended the set.  I will be selling mine.  This could have been a great release.  The quality looks good and appears otherwise complete.  Timeless Media has screwed the consumer again with another edited release.  I called and let them know how furious I am about this and encourage others to call and complain about this and their other butchered releases.  The show is worth 5 stars but I only gave 2 because of Timeless Media's moronic decision to omit the titles.  I will not buy any release by them and hope others will not either.",1222819200,7,842,4.583892617449664
2906597,4,B000TLTCOK,"As the other reviewers have said, Laredo is great entertainment, and the shows hold up remarkably well.  The characters are so much fun that you overlook some of the outlandishness and silliness.  No need to go into further detail on the content, as the other reviewers cover it accurately.  If you remember Laredo fondly, you will not be disappointed.

Picture and sound get a 4.  The shows have not been remastered with any attention.  Image is overly bright, the color can jump around a bit, and the compression was not done with the greatest care.  The image is mostly clean.  The episodes are all uncut.  There are 5 episodes on each dual-layered DVD.

The packaging is disappointing. Slim cases would have been better; the boxes have no description or information about the episodes beyond their titles, and each case is almost identical to the others.  There are no special features.  Although it would have been better had they been presented in broadcast order, it's not too annoying as there is not much continuity between the episodes.

Nevertheless, content trumps everything, and Laredo is a winner.  It belongs in your video library.",1217289600,3,1147,4.93717277486911
2906598,1,B000TLTCOK,"As much as I like william smith, neville brand and 60's t.v. westerns, these guys are annoying! Some of the comedy is good but the fact that these guys are always trying to backstab each other every chance they get throughout the 1st season, it gets old fast. My favorite scene is after smith and brown get brand put in jail(out of the way to get their greedy hands on some indian gold), brand gets out of jail just in time to save his partners but lets them suffer first by not cutting them loose to sweat it out'til he discovers the gold for himself(they don't like tasting their own medicine). I haven't seen season 2 but I hope Smith and brown's characters get to grow up. William Smith is a fantastic actor misused here. The show is never boring though and always something going on, lots of action, some funny situations like ""calico kid"" episode and many familiar guest stars. The dvd looks like the uncut episodes that originally aired on t.v.(unlike will sonnett, branded) picture is pretty good and audio even better.",1211155200,2,1027,4.586956521739131
2906599,5,B000TLTCOK,"I actually purchased this for my mom and I got it only after 3 days when I ordered. The DVDS were in great shape and I've had no problems!
Great Job!",1210204800,2,149,3.838709677419355
2906600,4,B000TLTCOK,While I liked this show very much I was disappointed the way Universal arranged the first DVD package. If they were going to do the first season in 2 parts they should have put them in order with the original airdates. Also they don't arrange them in chapters by episodes. Despite this flaw I probably will buy the remaining episodes. It was quite an ensemble of characters.  I wonder if they will put out the second season with Robert Wolders as Eric. I enjoyed this western very much.,1208995200,2,486,4.5227272727272725
2906601,4,B000TLTCOK,"This was a show I enjoyed when I was I kid; one of my three favorite westerns (the others being Maverick & Wild, Wild West). But I have to admit that I'd totally forgotten about it, until I ran across a reference to the new DVDs online. Forty-year old memories can be a little fuzzy, so before I bought the DVDs I rented. And this was one childhood show that's held up nicely--funny, lively, entertaining. The stories are engaging, there's plenty of action and lots of hilarious situations that the three Texas Rangers get themselves into. Gravel-voice Neville Brand is the heart and soul of the show--usually typecast as a heavy, here he's first-rate comic relief. As you proceed through the series, you'll also see a number of ""name"" actors put in guest appearances. If you're up for a funny, action-packed good time in old Texas, Laredo is the show for you.",1207958400,2,860,4.6644736842105265
2906602,5,B000TLTCOK,"I've liked this show since I was a horse crazy kid, and would watch any western just to see what horses the characters were riding. Recommended for anyone who likes 60's TV or westerns. Even after all these years it's still fun to watch, and William Smith is still a hunk. However, I never did get my horse.",1206230400,2,307,4.310344827586207
2906603,4,B000TLTCOK,"I remember this show when I was a kid but didn't really watch it much.  In viewing it today, yeah, it's a little dated but still an enjoyable combination of western adventure and laughs.  The comradre betwen Brand, Brown and Smith is pretty damned good.  Let not forget Phillip (Granny Goose) Carey.  That may lose something is you are under 45 or so. Yes, Neville Brand -- a Congressional Medal of Honor winner in WWII -- was a raging alcoholic.  Brown and Carey would go on to soap opera roles and William Smith would be best remembered for his biker films and being one of the best over the top crazed pschos in the movies.",1205798400,3,626,4.408695652173913
2906604,4,B000TLTCOK,"The West to all Color.

2906605,5,B000TLTCOK,"After checking and rechecking for years trying to find this tv show on tape - it's FINALLY here.  My VHS copies of the show have pretty much faded completely out.  This was one of my favorite shows when I was younger and it has not changed now that I am middle aged.  I sat down and watched this the day it came in the mail and most of the following weekend.  I enjoyed myself so much.  It was a wonderful show which should have lasted longer than it did.  Neville Brand, William Smith and Claude Akins were my favorites in this series.  There just are not shows like this on tv anymore which can just give you a good feeling watching it and over and over again.  I am so happy that this show was not lost.",1203984000,8,706,4.102189781021898
2906606,5,B000TLTCOK,"I was so happy to see this come out on DVD.  In 1965 I was 9 years old and fell in love with the character of Reese Bennett.  It is high camp western at its finest.  As was stated by another review when they lost Neville Brand the series fell apart.  Reese made Laredo the hit it was.
Enjoy a taste of 60s westerns.",1203811200,6,315,3.875
2906607,5,B000TLTCOK,"I wondered what this DVD contained when I saw it listed in several places but seemingly not available or ""backordered"". I finally found one actually for sale and ordered it. I suppose you could call it a Laredo Sampler, as it contains five episodes from Timeless Media's Best of Laredo, Season One, Part One set. It's exactly the same as one of the discs in the full set, and contains the episodes Rendezvous At Arillo, Anybody Here Seen Billy?, I See By Your Outfit, A Question of Discipline, and Limit-of-the-Law Larkin. If you already have the full three-disc set, you don't necessarily need this but it would make a nice item for someone who wanted to try the show without buying the whole thing.",1203552000,42,700,4.653225806451613
2906608,4,B000TLTCOK,"I loved this series as a girl (especially William Smith!), and I love the DVDs - except for 1 thing.  The episodes aren't the first 15 that aired, and they aren't in airdate order.  Attn: DVD Manufaturers: DO NOT bother with ""Best Of"" type collections.  All you're doing is disappointing your customers.  Everyone has their personal favorites, and nine times out of ten, it's not going to be what Hollywood thinks it should be.  I would much rather just get all the episodes of a series, in straight airdate order.  Thank you.",1203206400,16,526,4.663043478260869
