8148124,5,B000IZJR1A,"This film has it all! Like much Indian food. Adventure, comedy, every genre all packed into one. We saw this 35 years ago at the University of Minnesota with friends who took us to the Hindi movies every week, shown on screen before anyone had VCR's or DVD players. I was editor of the Indo-American Newsletter. This was the one film that stood out in my memory. Talking on the phone recently to the old friend with whom we had seen this, I decided to see if there was a copy around with English subtitles. I had found a DVD at an Indian food store about 12-15 years ago but no subtitles! So I couldn't understand it!!! Very fun to get it and watch it again.",1385424000,,658,4.23015873015873
8148125,5,B000IZJR1A,"I first saw Fakira about 30 years ago. I have watched it numerous times over the years. It is the story of two orphans who were separated after their parents died. They are reunited years later and then take revenge against those responsible for their parents death. The story is comical in some areas, and the music is wonderful.",1379376000,,330,4.610169491525424
