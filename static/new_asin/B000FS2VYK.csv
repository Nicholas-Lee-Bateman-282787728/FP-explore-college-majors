2582756,5,B000FS2VYK,I love the collection of the Lupin movies the difference in the movies than the series is funimation dubb the movies but pionner geneon dubb the series. The characters even look different especially Fujiko. Lupin in the movies he's more of a fighter which is awesome.,1152316800,4,267,4.826086956521739

8125824,4,B000FS2VYK,"All rather enjoyable TV movies and one theatrical one (Dead or Alive). Provided in Japanese and English (I think on Twilight Gemini it is. But it might not be, and it might also be edited for content). Dead or Alive certainly gets rather dark and gritty, kind of away from the comical aspects of the TV movies. The only TV movie it's really close in tone with is Island of Assassins that's in the next box set. Both are rather dark for the character, but supposedly closer to the manga.

Like I said though, Funimation decided to release an edited cut of Twilight Gemini, they released an Uncut version as well, but mixed them up for the box set and so some early sold versions had the edited cut. So be wary. The edited version is like watching a 4Kids version of Lupin the 3rd or a TV edit version. Apparently Funimation hoped to release this to TV some time and made an edited version.

The cuts affect nudity, violence and some brief really minor profanity.

The box sets are sadly out of print as is the titles. Hopefully Discotek steps up to release them all. They already have stated plans to release Voyage to Danger in a new edition.",1452556800,,1142,4.428571428571429
8125825,5,B000FS2VYK,These movies are so good. All of the action is over the top fun. I would even recommend them to someone who isn't  fan of anime.,1413504000,,128,3.923076923076923
8125826,5,B000FS2VYK,"I've been meaning to start a Lupin the Third collection, and the First Haul set of DVDs was an excellent choice to start with. I may be a bit biased seeing as this my favorite anime series, but I enjoyed all five movies. I was worried that a Funimation dub would be sub par and just not work, but I was wrong. During the first movie, it seemed like the cast was still getting into character a bit, but after that, they just fell into the roles of the characters I've come to know and love.

I thoroughly enjoyed the plot of each film, as well. While I'm sure there are flaws, I was too busy enjoying the films to notice any.",1254614400,6,624,4.114754098360656
8125827,5,B000FS2VYK,The animation quality of Dead or Alive is something that impressed me a lot.  The other films are fun as well.  Animators and fans alike can learn from the quality of the art.,1235692800,7,175,4.2727272727272725
8125828,3,B000FS2VYK,"I bought this, think it was from best buy? It was a while ago. Either way, it wasn't from amazon. The movies are all pretty good, some better than others, translation is nice and they leave the options for dual audios and subtitles, which for whatever reason anime distributors love to leave out. Except on the last disc... It was english only, which bothers me not because I am some anti dub fanatic but because it was marketed as japanese with english subs, it also has copy and pasted elements to I suppose censor it, I'm not entirely sure. I'm not sure if this was some kind of mix up with another version, but I've tried contacting funimation multiple times to get a replacement, since I didn't notice till it was far too long to get a refund or replacement from my local store. All my efforts on this front were fruitless, and while I got a response and I sent them the serial number information, I never actually got sent it. Just make sure you check out all the discs before you start using it...",1232236800,2,1004,4.403225806451613
8125829,5,B000FS2VYK,"Most people say ""it ain't Miyuzaki"".  However, the difference (besides style) is action.  This movie pack has a lot more to do with cunning and ingenuity than just straight boom and blow em' up.  I think anyone who likes 007, or likes watching ""Cat-and-Mouse"" movies will really like this one.  One word of caution:  This is definately not a movie for kids...so make sure they're gone!!  And to Die-Hard anime fans like myself, swoop this one up while you can!!!  It's worth it!",1222387200,8,478,4.686746987951807
8125830,3,B000FS2VYK,I thought these were Miyazaki films after seeing the Castle of Cagliostro - sadly they're not. Good fun but not in the master's league.,1193788800,,135,4.666666666666667
8125831,5,B000FS2VYK,Lupin reminds me of a James Bond thief. The cast is great and the voice acting is top notch. Highly recommend.,1186099200,,110,4.285714285714286
8125832,4,B000FS2VYK,"This contains 5 of the Lupin movies: Voyage to Danger, Secret of the Twilght Gemini, Dragon of Doom, Persuite of Harimao's Treasure and Dead or Alive.

I've watched all but two(Harimao and DoA) and they're all fairly good. The English dubs are done by a diff. team as opposed to the TV show put out by Pioneer, and I have to say that im not as fond of the funimation team. Its not the voices so much as the dubbing is just not as good. The movies also are not as well done as Secret of Mamo or Cagilostro, Twilight Gemini especialy. When the plot starts to lag in Twilight Gemini the flash some shots of Fujiko's boobs in hopes of sucking you back in. Voyage to Danger features Jigen in a plot line that highlights him, as opposed to mearly Lupin's sidekick. Dragon of Doom does likewise with Goemon, and lets us hear some stories of Lupin I. One of the other two(DoA) i have heard of and hear as far as the newer films is one of the best. The Persuite of Harimao's Treasure ive heard nothing of, but if its like the rest of the Lupin movies, it should be pretty good",1171497600,8,1067,4.204878048780488
