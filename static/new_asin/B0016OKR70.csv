3161978,5,B0016OKR70,I had bought this item for a 21 year old. she wanted to relive her past. She loved it. It was worth the money!,1263859200,,110,3.625
3161979,5,B0016OKR70,This video went to my grandson and he is innamored with it.  Couldn't wait to see it so he saw it on Christmas evening.  How cute is that.  Thanks for a nice product.,1262822400,,166,3.9696969696969697
3161980,5,B0016OKR70,"My family has had this product for about 20 yrs, since it was on VHS tape!  The songs are awesome, the animation is wonderful, Carole King is awesome.  We still love these songs!  Your kids will enjoy it too.",1257724800,15,208,4.282051282051282
3161981,5,B0016OKR70,"Bought this as part of a box set of Scholastic DVDs. This is one of our daughter's favourites (aged 3). As much as she enjoys Dora and Yo Gabba Gabba as much as the next kid, she loves singing/songs in anything. Yet because of the less-than-colourful images and simple animation style, even I was a little suprised at just how much she enjoys this one.

I do agree with other reviewers that this is not your average kids' fare and many may not take to it. However we aren't likely to take our 3 year old to see the new Spike Jonze movie (though I am very tempted and she is very interested), so this version is as close as she'll get for some time (until we parents can vet it on DVD later on). The 'Where the Wild Things Are' is straight from the book, like it has come to life. She really enjoys it - asks to see it regularly. Nothing overly frightening, safe to watch right before bedtime.

I didn't know the other stories at all before seeing them on this DVD. The Nutshell Kids segment is lots of fun (probably her favourite really) with short songs/stories (good for short attention spans!) on simple themes. 'A is for Alligator' goes through the alphabet with an alliteration of rather unconventional word choices (fun). Daughter requested that she have 'Chicken Soup with Rice' for dinner after seeing this. Now my husband found the Carole King songs (album named 'Really Rosie') and loaded them on our iPods. We are learning the words so we can all sing along in the car.

So if your intended audience likes 'Where the Wild Things Are' but isn't really of age to see the new movie, this could be the way to go. Also if they love music and singing, this could be a hit with yours as much as it is with ours for the other content.",1257724800,17,1737,4.354938271604938
3161982,5,B0016OKR70,"I bought this for my sister-in-law, who works at a child-care center. I bought it more to placate my nostalgia for the songs of Carol King, and the limited animations I had watched in the local library as a child, during after-school care (They were only available on 8mm then).

It's probably more suited to nostalgia-buffs, than kids of today, who have Dora, the Explorer; Ben-Ten; et al, to entertain them. But some kids actually like this! I'm buying myself a second copy to keep for my future spawn, in the hope they ask me what was around when I was a kid.",1255996800,,562,4.456310679611651
3161983,3,B0016OKR70,"kids don't like to watch it! Yes it's a ""classic"" but I enjoy it more than the kids. Which really isn't saying much because animated stories are for them.",1234137600,6,154,4.344827586206897
3161984,5,B0016OKR70,"This DVD contains a collection of the best of the Maurice Sendak children's books.  The subtitles come on automatically so the child can read or SING along, but you can turn them off if you prefer, of course.

First is Where the Wild Things Are, a story of a boy having a dream about friendly monsters after being sent to his room for punishment.  The illustrations are bold and the reading and accompanying sound and music add to the story.  Next is In the Night Kitchen, which is read and sung.  The tune is very catchy.  One note, this is also a dream story.  As the boy, Mickey, dreams he is falling his pajamas fall off.  The nudity is not graphic, but you could skip that story if it bothers you.  The rest of the stories are from the Nutshell books, which Carole King put to music for her project Really Rosie.  These tunes are absolutely wonderful.  Your children will sing along and sing them other times, too.  Chicken Soup With Rice seems to be the favorite of my little library patrons.  They will sing it any time they spot the book.  And, these are good songs that adults enjoy as well, not cloyingly obnoxious kiddie songs that will fray your nerves.  The Nutshell books are Chicken Soup With Rice, Pierre, One Was Johnny, and Alligators All Around.

This DVD is definitely on my ""must have"" list for my library's DVD collection in our children's room.",1232236800,68,1367,4.495934959349594
3161985,5,B0016OKR70,"I received the video in a timely fashion. Appears to be in good shape. This is a Christmas gift, so I can't say that my nephew enjoys it yet or not. I Like the concept of the book being on a video format, though, as the genre is about the right age bracket for his enjoyment and he loves watching DVDs, particularly cartoons. What kid doesn't? I believe my choice is a good one.",1226275200,,378,4.121621621621622
3162006,2,B0016OKR70,My class and I only liked the first story.,1489622400,,42,3.7777777777777777

3162009,5,B0016OKR70,"I already have this on VHS at my school but wanted the DVD for the coming grandchild to enjoy. A lovely, lively version of books set to music and drama!",1471132800,,152,4.1
3162010,5,B0016OKR70,"I absolutely love this DVD.  The stories themselves are of course classics and we have them all in book form, but there is something about hearing these stories out loud, particularly the ones set to Carol King's melodies that is so soothing.  I especially love Chicken Soup with Rice.  I could watch it over and over again with my kids.  I like the option of seeing the words on the screen too, which helps with learning to read by visually following along with the books.  I can't recommend this enough.",1468108800,,505,4.566666666666666
3162011,5,B0016OKR70,This is a terrific book.  I used this in my classroom for many years and enjoyed watching the children read it.  They also wanted me to read it to them.  Now my grandson reads it and he likes it a lot.,1468108800,,201,3.8536585365853657

3162014,5,B0016OKR70,My children loved this book and now my grandchildren are having the pleasure of sharing it with their children.  Yes I am a great Great-grand-mother reading this and also showing the dvd to my Great-grand-children.,1454457600,,214,5.114285714285714
3162015,1,B0016OKR70,"This is just way too disturbing for kids. My almost 4 year old daughter has been crying for hours about the image of Mickey being stirred into the batter. She was trembling with fear and won't let me be more than an inch from her, and she's not normally so sensitive. I'm afraid to see what happens when I put her to bed tonight. Really wishing I never put this DVD on. It's in the trash now. Obviously I would NOT recommend it at all.",1454025600,,435,4.129411764705883

3162040,5,B0016OKR70,Love this.,1444608000,,10,4.5
3162041,5,B0016OKR70,"My kids had this when they were growing up and just loved it! Now my grandkids watch it and love it! The stories are very creative, and the songs are great. Our favorite song is Chicken Soup With Rice--very catchy! There's also a book too. The quality is old-school, so don't expect the high-tech graphics they have in today's cartoons ( but I also think that's the appeal in it too!). Also if nudity bothers you, you probably don't want to watch In the Night Kitchen. The little boy's clothes fall off, nothing is shown in detail ( mostly his bottom) or done in a sexual way whatsoever. If it was like that I would be totally against it. It's just being silly, which is just my opinion though.",1444435200,,694,4.387596899224806
3162042,5,B0016OKR70,"This CD is absolutely the best little collection of stories!  When my kids were young, we had this collection on a VHS tape (which they just about wore out playing it over and over again) so I was glad to see it appear on a CD for a new generation to enjoy.  The stories are short, the illustrations are simply understood by the young ones and entertaining enough for older kids, too.  The music will get stuck in your head for a long time after the stories are finished.",1439942400,,471,4.269662921348314
3162043,5,B0016OKR70,"I purchased this so I could watch In the Night Kitchen. I used to watch In the Night Kitchen on YouTube, but it always kept getting removed. Now that I have this, I don't have to put up with YouTube taking it down any longer.",1437264000,,225,4.022222222222222
3162044,5,B0016OKR70,"My two year old loves these videos.  They are basically just the animated version of the classic storybooks.  They are slower paced and stories she knows and loves.  They are also very short 3-8 minutes each generally, so it's something I'm comfortable giving into her requests of more for.",1436486400,,290,4.877551020408164
3162045,5,B0016OKR70,My granddaughter loves this. I don't much care for it.,1435104000,,54,4.5
3162066,4,B0016OKR70,"I had this years ago on VHS and wanted to be able to play it for my grandson as we are reading my sons favorite books, Where the Wild Things Are and In the Night Kitchen. He is getting a kick out of seeing them animated. I was amazed how I remembered alll the lyrics to the other songs.
I would recommend this video for young children especially if you are reading these particular stories to them.",1435104000,,398,4.181818181818182
3162067,3,B0016OKR70,The animation for Where the Wild Things Are was just like the book which was great for my 3 & 5 year olds. The other shorts were a little odd but the boys still liked them. Having 3 out of the five stories sung instead of read was not as engaging.,1433462400,,247,3.8627450980392157
3162068,1,B0016OKR70,I agree.  The stories are weird.,1432166400,,32,4.333333333333333

3162070,5,B0016OKR70,"OK, I admit I'm a g-granny, but I love these stories. Scholastic books are the greatest. (I haven't yet tried the DVD on a youngster.) They are a great get-away from car chases, bombs, deafening explosions, murder. More entertaining than so-called ""adult"" fare.",1430092800,,261,5.093023255813954
3162071,5,B0016OKR70,This is an incredible little collection of animated stories from Maurice Sendak. They bring me back to my childhood and now I get to share them with my son. The last three are actually musical versions of the stories from the pocket library collection. and this DVD makes a great companion to the books themselves.,1430006400,,314,4.7272727272727275
3162072,4,B0016OKR70,"Just like I remembered from when I was a kid. I was so happy to be able to share them with my toddler son.

3162074,5,B0016OKR70,"Previously I had the vhs tape of this and seem to have lost it, I couldn't rewind it fast enough the my grandkids but the advantage of that was that they had to watch the other stories before Wild Things came on. Now I have the dvd the next group of grandkids can go straight to whichever story (Wild Things) they want to watch and they will miss out on some useful and entertaining information.",1426291200,,395,4.28
3162075,5,B0016OKR70,Love Maurice Syndak and this is a replacement copy as my original became lost in transit from Germany. Some stories are worth spending money to replace.,1425427200,,152,4.884615384615385

3162107,4,B0016OKR70,"I bought this for a 2 year old little boy who loves Where the Wild Things Are. We read the book constantly. He has the Max doll. We both enjoyed the DVD reading of Where the Wild Things Are. However, the other ""stories"" included on the DVD were not impressive. He had no interest in watching those, and I didn't either. They weren't very entertaining.",1405036800,,351,4.415384615384616
3162108,5,B0016OKR70,I loved the story when I was young!  Me niece just had a baby and Where the Wild Things Are was a must have!,1404604800,,108,3.5

3162133,4,B0016OKR70,"This is just copy of the VHS product to DVD. When you watch it, you can tell it by its fuzziness. But, I think it's because we're so accustomed to the HD's. This is a true classic! This is one of my toddler's favorites.",1398643200,,219,4.0
3162134,5,B0016OKR70,"I've always loved this book. even though I still have my copy from childhood, I bought another one for the kids to keep and pass on to their kids. love the illustration",1393718400,,168,4.28125

3162141,2,B0016OKR70,"My kids seem to like this just fine, but I find the reading of The Night Kitchen pretty creepy. It's really weird that the last four are entirely sung, also. I guess I always heard something different in my head. Very 70s.",1376956800,,222,4.309523809523809
3162145,1,B0016OKR70,"This is the weirdest DVD ever! I have purchased several of the Scholastic DVD storybooks and loved them all, until this one. Carole King sings several of the books. The stories are weird. I would NOT ever tell anyone to buy this DVD.",1375747200,,233,4.441860465116279
3162146,5,B0016OKR70,I love Maurice Sendak's stories; Where the Wild Things Are was a favorite of my daughter and then my grandchildren! This dvd contains five of Sendak's beloved stories and is sure to entertain children of all agesand many people who haven't entirely left childhood behind. In the Night Kitchen is cheeky and so fun! Highly recommend this dvd to any fans of Sendak.,1375747200,,363,4.777777777777778
3162147,5,B0016OKR70,Bought this for my 2 year-old granddaughter.  We had to watch it at least 10 times within 5 days.  She loved it!,1375660800,,112,4.045454545454546
3162148,5,B0016OKR70,"Okay, this is kind of a weird confessions but...I keep making the kids watch this. The music is so catchy. I love Carole King. I had no idea Maurice Sendak was so weird. The illustration colors remind me of the 70s, there is no cartoon animation. It's just a story being read to you and sung to you and it is...terrific!! Anyway, the kids don't mind. Their favorite story is Pierre, because they think the lion is *so* funny when he eats Pierre. Oops, was that a spoiler? ;)",1375660800,2,474,4.337078651685394
3162149,3,B0016OKR70,"The video is amazing, but the picture size is so small in comparison, it's not full screen so we're always concerned our child is squinting.  I agree with other parents it's much better than putting on the other shows out there.",1371686400,,228,4.560975609756097

3162153,5,B0016OKR70,Got this for a collector's item and will watch on occasion. Had this on VHS ages ago when my girls were little (over 20 years ago) then my ex-husband kept it out of spite. He knew it was the girls favorite.,1368057600,,206,4.048780487804878
3162154,5,B0016OKR70,"I used to watch this with my son when he was a toddler. I don't know who likes it better, him or me. He's 12 years old now and still loves sharing it with all his friends.

3162173,5,B0016OKR70,I had this collection when my son was a young boy.  Very good stories with morals to them.  Interesting artwork.  Great music.  Shipped & arrived swiftly.  Thank you!,1366502400,,166,4.785714285714286
3162174,4,B0016OKR70,"I first sought to purchase this DVD because the compilation of stories was such a hit back when my kids were growing up and were shown on the ""Children's Circle"" on PBS, along with other classic books.  Now, my just 2-yr-old grandson asks for ""MAX"" while he's choosing his favorite titles from the bookshelf, and loves to watch the story pages come to life to enhance what he sees when reading the actual books. Songwriter Carol King composed background music and sings through each of the Sendak nutshell library stories, also included, leaving you singing along with the ""alligators all around"" alphabet, as one example (which my daughter's 1st grade class learned to use American sign language to). In all 6 stories, you are given the choice of reading along with Sendak's words on the screen, or just listening to the narration and music. Both wonderful and strange, the ""wild things.."" and ""..night kitchen"" story lines are very dream-like in nature, yet where kids like to join in the rumpus with Max or fashion an airplane on a mission with young Mickey.  But be prepared when it comes to small ""Pierre"" and his bold disregard for his parents' civil requests, who finally finds wisdom in their regard the hard way.",1366329600,4,1221,4.809523809523809

3162176,1,B0016OKR70,"My three year old loves Where the Wild Things Are, but this video really old.  The others stories on the DVD are really bad.  To make matters worse, several of them are set to a Carole King soundtrack, making them incredibly dated.  Unless you want bad grainy stories from the early 1960's set to mediocre music, don't buy this DVD.",1364774400,,332,4.5
3162177,5,B0016OKR70,"Since it's pretty short, this is great for when you need your toddler entertained for 15-30 minutes. Lovely story, of course.",1362182400,,125,5.0
3162178,5,B0016OKR70,This dvd was purchased for my grandchildren for Christmas. They have enjoyed it immensely and even sing the songs throughout the day. The adults have watched it also and love the animation and stories.,1361232000,,201,4.9411764705882355
3162179,5,B0016OKR70,"Maurice Sendak himself drew the lively illustrations for this animation  movie - so the film is as close to the book as possible. Absolutely, this is the one to buy for your 3-7 year olds.  The live action movie does not capture the magic of the book ... so, in my opinion, it should be avoided.

Hard to imagine, but this story was revolutionary in its day...about a misbehaving boy who dreams up a fantastic world of curious beasts and then ultimately desires to come home (as in the Wizard of Oz).

In summary, in its own way, this is an animation classic.",1361145600,,559,4.398058252427185

Most people are familiar with Where the Wild Things Are, but following it are numerous short stories set to music written by Carole King that make this video special. I highly suggest also purchasing the small set of  four books, the Nutshell Library (illustrated by Maurice Sendak) that King put to music. That way you can ""sing"" the books with your kids at night or on the road. Some are educational, others are just fun, but they are very entertaining, and not annoying even after hearing multiple times.

3162207,4,B0016OKR70,"This DVD contains the following stories (all by Maurice Sendak):

Where the Wild Things Are
In the Night Kitchen
Pierre
One Was Johnny
Chicken Soup with Rice
Alligators All Around

I'm a music teacher, and I buy these DVDs for my class. Primarily, I look for stories that my students can sing along with. Secondarily, I look for stories that teach anything about music, or stories involving music in some way. What attracted me to this DVD was the first 2 stories being narrated by Peter Schickele (aka PDQ Bach), and that the last 4 stories were all sung by Carole King. Those names should date these stories for you; the audio (and visual) quality of the Carole King stories is not stellar, but you can still understand it.

WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE is a classic. This version of the story doesn't disappoint. There's no singing, but Peter Schickele, in addition to narrating, orchestrated this story with a chamber ensemble. The story goes by pretty quickly, but it's entertaining throughout.

IN THE NIGHT KITCHEN: I don't quite know what to say about this story. I think the best description is ""acid trip"". In this story, Mickey, a little boy, hears noises in the kitchen at night and drifts out of bed and discovers what the racket its. Throughout the story, Mickey is naked, and at several brief points it shows his privates (front and back) - it's all very innocent. What Mickey discovers in the kitchen is three humongous bakers, all with t he face of Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and Hardy - complete with his iconic mustache), who try to bake him in a cake. Mickey escapes, and flies around in a bread dough airplane, until he is able to supply the bakers with what they REALLY need for their cake: milk. The message in the end is: ""That's why we eat cake for breakfast""......?????????  All this being said, I actually find it really entertaining in a VERY odd way...but I'm still on the fence about whether I would show it to my class...

PIERRE is the first of the Carole King songs. It's a cute enough story about a boy who only says ""I don't care"", which gets him eaten by a lion. The lion later spits him out, and then he starts to care. The moral at the end is simple: care. I would be hesitant to show this story to some of my students, because they might find it funny to just start saying ""I don't care"" to everything.

ONE WAS JOHNNY is a very short story, but a good one. It counts up to nine through the distractions that Johnny faces, and then back down from nine when they all leave. Simple and cute.

CHICKEN SOUP WITH RICE is actually the most useful story for me, because the chorus is very easy for kids to pick up, and it's a cute song that takes you through the months of the calendar year. The read-along feature also makes it easy to sing with. I like it a lot!

ALLIGATORS ALL AROUND is an alphabet song. It's another cute little short story that kids can really enjoy.

All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this DVD. It suits my needs well, and it's very entertaining!",1330992000,6,2997,4.462522851919561
3162208,1,B0016OKR70,"Where the Wild Things are is great.  The rest of the stories bored my daughter and I found them to be a bit disturbing.  The third story features a little boy saying ""I don't care"" to everything including dying.  I did not mind the nudity in the second story, but I know that can be a problem for some parents and some situations.",1330905600,4,330,4.2063492063492065

3162210,3,B0016OKR70,"I purchased this for my 3 and 5 year old kids because I thought they would like Where the Wild Things Are. They did enjoy it and then I was surprised by the second show In the Kitchen. It had a naked little boy used for the story. Not something I would recommend for my children to watch much. Plus one of the shows features a little boy Pier singing a song about saying, ""I don't care"". Not something I'm trying to teach my young children. Overall, not my favorite Scholastic DVD collection, but if you love Where the Wild Things Are, you'll still want to own it.",1319328000,,564,4.231481481481482

3162223,5,B0016OKR70,Excellent video!  Our daughter has autism but loves the music combined with the stories she reads and loves.  Seeing them come to life made her so happy.  Both children love Where the Wild Things Are as well as the added storys/music and especially There Onces was a boy named Peirre by Carol King sung with the story.  Now they sing the songs all of the time.  I am so glad to have found this still available as the new movie version was too scary for our daughter.,1297641600,3,466,4.310344827586207

My favorite stories are those sung by Carole King, and Pierre in particular.  Her voice is so beautiful and she belts everything with such feeling that it's hard to miss the message.  In addition to this being one of my children's favorite DVDs, I use it as a teaching aid in a special education classroom.  The kids there love it too and it helps with their reading and memorization skills.  I would whole-heartedly recommend this DVD to any parent or teacher looking for beautiful stories and music to share with their children",1292803200,2,681,4.728813559322034

We love Scholastic Storybook Treasures because they stay true to the original books and each DVD has several stories on it, not just the story on the cover jacket. Where the Wild Things are is one of our son's favorite books so he loves watching this video. What I love the most on this DVD is the classic Nutshell Kids, with original songs by Carole King. Scholastic Storybook Treasures are great for long car rides, because I can ""play all"" stories on the DVD for at least an hour of entertainment that won't leave him bored.",1275264000,,579,4.471698113207547

My first surprise was that it was from 1970!  The second surprise was that the music was sung by Carole King!  I thought this was pretty dated and was all set for disappointment but my third and biggest surprise was how much my granddaughter enjoyed it and asked for it to be played over and over. I was afraid to buy her the new theatrical version of the story and settled for this one. I know now I made the right choice. It is wonderful and I know she will enjoy it time and time again.,1271030400,9,647,4.16

3396478,5,B0016OKR70,"Bought this as part of a box set of Scholastic DVDs. This is one of our daughter's favourites (aged 3). As much as she enjoys Dora and Yo Gabba Gabba as much as the next kid, she loves singing/songs in anything. Yet because of the less-than-colourful images and simple animation style, even I was a little suprised at just how much she enjoys this one.

I do agree with other reviewers that this is not your average kids' fare and many may not take to it. However we aren't likely to take our 3 year old to see the new Spike Jonze movie (though I am very tempted and she is very interested), so this version is as close as she'll get for some time (until we parents can vet it on DVD later on). The 'Where the Wild Things Are' is straight from the book, like it has come to life. She really enjoys it - asks to see it regularly. Nothing overly frightening, safe to watch right before bedtime.

I didn't know the other stories at all before seeing them on this DVD. The Nutshell Kids segment is lots of fun (probably her favourite really) with short songs/stories (good for short attention spans!) on simple themes. 'A is for Alligator' goes through the alphabet with an alliteration of rather unconventional word choices (fun). Daughter requested that she have 'Chicken Soup with Rice' for dinner after seeing this. Now my husband found the Carole King songs (album named 'Really Rosie') and loaded them on our iPods. We are learning the words so we can all sing along in the car.

So if your intended audience likes 'Where the Wild Things Are' but isn't really of age to see the new movie, this could be the way to go. Also if they love music and singing, this could be a hit with yours as much as it is with ours for the other content.",1257724800,17,1737,4.354938271604938

I bought it more to placate my nostalgia for the songs of Carol King, and the limited animations I had watched in the local library as a child, during after-school care (They were only available on 8mm then).

It's probably more suited to nostalgia-buffs, than kids of today, who have Dora, the Explorer; Ben-Ten; et al, to entertain them. But some kids actually like this! I'm buying myself a second copy to keep for my future spawn, in the hope they ask me what was around when I was a kid.",1255996800,,562,4.456310679611651

3396481,5,B0016OKR70,"This DVD contains a collection of the best of the Maurice Sendak children's books.  The subtitles come on automatically so the child can read or SING along, but you can turn them off if you prefer, of course.

First is Where the Wild Things Are, a story of a boy having a dream about friendly monsters after being sent to his room for punishment.  The illustrations are bold and the reading and accompanying sound and music add to the story.  Next is In the Night Kitchen, which is read and sung.  The tune is very catchy.  One note, this is also a dream story.  As the boy, Mickey, dreams he is falling his pajamas fall off.  The nudity is not graphic, but you could skip that story if it bothers you.  The rest of the stories are from the Nutshell books, which Carole King put to music for her project Really Rosie.  These tunes are absolutely wonderful.  Your children will sing along and sing them other times, too.  Chicken Soup With Rice seems to be the favorite of my little library patrons.  They will sing it any time they spot the book.  And, these are good songs that adults enjoy as well, not cloyingly obnoxious kiddie songs that will fray your nerves.  The Nutshell books are Chicken Soup With Rice, Pierre, One Was Johnny, and Alligators All Around.

Now, my just 2-yr-old grandson asks for ""MAX"" while he's choosing his favorite titles from the bookshelf, and loves to watch the story pages come to life to enhance what he sees when reading the actual books. Songwriter Carol King composed background music and sings through each of the Sendak nutshell library stories, also included, leaving you singing along with the ""alligators all around"" alphabet, as one example (which my daughter's 1st grade class learned to use American sign language to). In all 6 stories, you are given the choice of reading along with Sendak's words on the screen, or just listening to the narration and music. Both wonderful and strange, the ""wild things.."" and ""..night kitchen"" story lines are very dream-like in nature, yet where kids like to join in the rumpus with Max or fashion an airplane on a mission with young Mickey.  But be prepared when it comes to small ""Pierre"" and his bold disregard for his parents' civil requests, who finally finds wisdom in their regard the hard way.",1366329600,4,1221,4.809523809523809

Hard to imagine, but this story was revolutionary in its day...about a misbehaving boy who dreams up a fantastic world of curious beasts and then ultimately desires to come home (as in the Wizard of Oz).

I highly suggest also purchasing the small set of  four books, the Nutshell Library (illustrated by Maurice Sendak) that King put to music. That way you can ""sing"" the books with your kids at night or on the road. Some are educational, others are just fun, but they are very entertaining, and not annoying even after hearing multiple times.

3396704,4,B0016OKR70,"This DVD contains the following stories (all by Maurice Sendak):

Where the Wild Things Are
In the Night Kitchen
Pierre
One Was Johnny
Chicken Soup with Rice
Alligators All Around

I'm a music teacher, and I buy these DVDs for my class. Primarily, I look for stories that my students can sing along with. Secondarily, I look for stories that teach anything about music, or stories involving music in some way. What attracted me to this DVD was the first 2 stories being narrated by Peter Schickele (aka PDQ Bach), and that the last 4 stories were all sung by Carole King. Those names should date these stories for you; the audio (and visual) quality of the Carole King stories is not stellar, but you can still understand it.

WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE is a classic. This version of the story doesn't disappoint. There's no singing, but Peter Schickele, in addition to narrating, orchestrated this story with a chamber ensemble. The story goes by pretty quickly, but it's entertaining throughout.

IN THE NIGHT KITCHEN: I don't quite know what to say about this story. I think the best description is ""acid trip"". In this story, Mickey, a little boy, hears noises in the kitchen at night and drifts out of bed and discovers what the racket its. Throughout the story, Mickey is naked, and at several brief points it shows his privates (front and back) - it's all very innocent. What Mickey discovers in the kitchen is three humongous bakers, all with t he face of Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and Hardy - complete with his iconic mustache), who try to bake him in a cake. Mickey escapes, and flies around in a bread dough airplane, until he is able to supply the bakers with what they REALLY need for their cake: milk. The message in the end is: ""That's why we eat cake for breakfast""......?????????  All this being said, I actually find it really entertaining in a VERY odd way...but I'm still on the fence about whether I would show it to my class...

PIERRE is the first of the Carole King songs. It's a cute enough story about a boy who only says ""I don't care"", which gets him eaten by a lion. The lion later spits him out, and then he starts to care. The moral at the end is simple: care. I would be hesitant to show this story to some of my students, because they might find it funny to just start saying ""I don't care"" to everything.

ONE WAS JOHNNY is a very short story, but a good one. It counts up to nine through the distractions that Johnny faces, and then back down from nine when they all leave. Simple and cute.

CHICKEN SOUP WITH RICE is actually the most useful story for me, because the chorus is very easy for kids to pick up, and it's a cute song that takes you through the months of the calendar year. The read-along feature also makes it easy to sing with. I like it a lot!

ALLIGATORS ALL AROUND is an alphabet song. It's another cute little short story that kids can really enjoy.

All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this DVD. It suits my needs well, and it's very entertaining!",1330992000,6,2997,4.462522851919561
3396705,1,B0016OKR70,"Where the Wild Things are is great.  The rest of the stories bored my daughter and I found them to be a bit disturbing.  The third story features a little boy saying ""I don't care"" to everything including dying.  I did not mind the nudity in the second story, but I know that can be a problem for some parents and some situations.",1330905600,4,330,4.2063492063492065

They did enjoy it and then I was surprised by the second show In the Kitchen. It had a naked little boy used for the story. Not something I would recommend for my children to watch much. Plus one of the shows features a little boy Pier singing a song about saying, ""I don't care"". Not something I'm trying to teach my young children.

3396720,5,B0016OKR70,Excellent video!  Our daughter has autism but loves the music combined with the stories she reads and loves.  Seeing them come to life made her so happy.

Now they sing the songs all of the time.  I am so glad to have found this still available as the new movie version was too scary for our daughter.,1297641600,3,466,4.310344827586207

My favorite stories are those sung by Carole King, and Pierre in particular.  Her voice is so beautiful and she belts everything with such feeling that it's hard to miss the message.  In addition to this being one of my children's favorite DVDs, I use it as a teaching aid in a special education classroom.
