7799950,2,1598035738,I bought this for one of my girls who was taking Discrete mathematics in college because she was originally having some difficulty with the subject.  Sadly according to her this did not help her at all. She said neither the dvd or the book was helpful.  Momma was trying to help- wasted money.,1468800000,,293,4.509433962264151

7799953,5,1598035738,"This is a serious treatment of number theory and other topics in discrete mathematics by an enthusiastic professor who has mastered the art.  Unlike other such videos, this course contains both abstract theory and detailed examples that support the theory.

The guide that comes with the video is a faithful outline of the lectures and a useful tool in its own right.

While number theory is usually one of the most advanced courses in the undergraduate curriculum, this is mostly due to the focus placed on the continuous math needed to complete the march to calculus rather than the inherent difficulty of discrete math (an observation contained in the video).  A reasonable grasp of algebra is all that is needed to benefit from this course.

If you want to go deep into discrete math without sitting in class or stressing over the tests, this is probably the course for you.",1382745600,3,878,4.826666666666667
7799954,5,1598035738,"I have been a programmer for over 20 years and most of my math has been x++; which appeared to be sufficient. Took this course and my programming has really changed; it is so far beyond what I used to do as to almost be indescribable. I dread having to explain the algorithms to someone who doesn't have any background in Discrete math. This course opened my eyes to a world of computation and complexity that before was just something that I would wave my hand at and say ""There probably is a way to figure that out.""
The lecturer moves quickly which is hard but great. The math you would need to know would mostly be of the pre-calculus sort. This same company has a great precal course by Bruce Edwards that would be a solid preparation for this one.
The videos are well done and the lecturer seems to have a passion for what he teaches. I suspect that what you see is the result of years of boiling it down for some university course. Do the end of unit questions and you won't get lost.",1347235200,14,991,4.276595744680851
