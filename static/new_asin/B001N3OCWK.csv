If you are a history buff, that absurdity will turn you off instantly. Either way, the show insults everyone's intelligence by pretending to be a non-fiction show, when in actuality it is as artificial and empty-headed as the worst ""reality"" program on MTV or VH1.",1391904000,,399,4.714285714285714
3709418,5,B001N3OCWK,"Love the stories, especially because they are FACT not fiction.  Fascinating.  I definitely recommend the whole series, we loved them all.",1391299200,,138,5.523809523809524
3709419,5,B001N3OCWK,"Cities of the Underworld is a great show and Don Wildman is a wonderful host. He explains things really well and he has a really nice voice. This show goes under our world and shows us how people lived in years past. It is wonderful to see how our ancestors lived and how items they made or invented are inspiring people today and some are still in use. Some of the episodes are from our recent past as well, buried places from WWII are very moving.",1389139200,,449,4.232558139534884
3709420,1,B001N3OCWK,"Wow - hugely disappointing.  We bought this for our parents specifically because the Chicago episode occurs in Season Two - they opened the package on Christmas day to find that this episode is not included in the set!!!

This should NOT be sold as a complete season - it is in fact missing two episodes that ran during this season (Chicago and Katrina).  It appears as though this was a HIstory Channel mistake, not this seller specifically (History Channel's ""Compete Set"" isn't complete either.  But still - people need to know that they are not actually buying all of the episodes.

VERY upsetting - what a waste,",1324771200,,617,4.728971962616822
3709421,4,B001N3OCWK,"Cities of the Underworld is an American documentary television series that premiered on March 2, 2007 on History. The program explores the subterranean environment and culture beneath various civilizations. The show employes a quick-paced editing and shooting style along with extensive use of 3D computer graphics. Basically it's a mix between an History show and a Travel show. The show is hosted by Don Wildman.

This is one of my favorite show. In Season 2, the show takes us to the darkest recesses of New York, Dublin, Berlin, Moscow, Washington, DC and many more places. The show explore the relics of the ancient Maya, the Vikings and the Knights Templar. The show investigate the secrets of Stalin, Hitler and the Viet Cong. Episodes for Season 2:

1. Underground Apocalypse (Jerusalem, Israel)
2. Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and the Vietnamese jungle)
3. A-Bomb Underground (Tokyo and Hiroshima, Japan)
4. Viking Underground (Dublin, Ireland)
5. Hitler's Last Secret (Prague, Czech Republic)
6. Maya Underground (Belize)
7. Prophecies From Below (Jerusalem, Israel)
8. New York: Secret Societies (New York City, USA)
9. Washington, D.C.: Seat of Power (Washington, D.C., West Virginia)
10. Stalin's Secret Lair (Moscow, Russia)
11. Secret Soviet Bases (Ukraine)

Everything about Season 2 is great: The footages, the topics, the informations given to us....As always the host, Don Wildman, is doing a great job. Only disappointment: two episodes were left out of the DVD set, the episode about Chicago and the episode about New-Orleans. Overall it's a great collection, and if, like me, you buy a lot of DVDs about History or about other Countries you need to add this DVD set to your collection. :)",1320192000,,1716,5.16546762589928
3709422,4,B001N3OCWK,"Interesting video with stunning visuals; great for high school classroom use.  However, they buy into and perpetuate the 2012 hype, ignoring the beliefs of most experts on the Mayans and even Mayan elders themselves.  Aside from this departure from true history, it is an excellent series.",1292976000,,289,5.260869565217392
3709423,4,B001N3OCWK,"Two Season Two episodes are missing:

17 Mar 08 -- Mob Underground
28 Apr 08 -- Katrina Underground

Neither are listed in Amazon's summary (taken from The History Channel's
""shop"" site (shop.history.com) for the upcoming Season Three box set. (Both are available (on DVD-R) from The History Channel (for $25 EACH!))

A couple remarks about the series itself:
1) The ""Gee Whiz"" attitude of the host (Don Wildman) doesn't take long to grate.
2) The same music score is used in every episode so that gets old fast as well.
But the locations and history are real and that's what makes the series interesting.",1239840000,,605,4.798076923076923

3709425,5,B001N3OCWK,"This series is a great adventure show in which the underworld loving
host Eric G takes us beneath many various places and cities in a hunt for history and knowledge. Each episode travels somewhere in the world to a new location to see more exciting explorations of history and mystery.
And there isn't a bad episode either because there are so many places that can be visited and seen in so many locations.  Season 2 keeps up the great spread of
explorations from around the globe and not one is boring because history and things that lie below us are always fascinating.  Let's  hope Mr. G
makes it out to Colorado someday to see the death pit in trinidad and of course Cheyenne Mountain Complex the worlds most famous and important bunker complex.  Every season of this show is worth seeing or owning because you learn something in a enjoyable underground history hunt.",1238284800,,871,4.673202614379085
