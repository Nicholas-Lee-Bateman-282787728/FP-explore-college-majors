This is a fast-moving, interesting film with good acting and an engaging plot. Its well worth watching.",1514332800,,263,5.285714285714286
7995673,5,B0000A381Y,"This is indeed a great movie, probably Ulmer's best. It's shameful that it isn't available in a decent format. I have seen it at a film museum and on European TV in excellent prints, so there is no excuse for the poor quality of this tape. There was an Edgar Ulmer series of DVDs a few years ago, but unfortunately it didn't include this. It's time for someone (Criterion?) to fill the gap.",1211932800,,390,4.3561643835616435
7995674,2,B0000A381Y,"good price, fast delivery, but barely watchable. I expected not the highest quality, but it was the poorest quality video I've ever watched.
Fuzzy, Muddy, scratchy describe the picture",1199664000,,184,5.379310344827586
7995675,1,B0000A381Y,"This is a superb movie with Zachary Scott at his rattiest, Diana Lynn at her prettiest, and Sydney Greenstreet in his best performance outside of the Maltese Falcon.  Unfortunately, the VHS tape by Terra Entertainment is the LOWEST quality tape I've ever seen!!!  It is literally painful to watch.  It is certainly RUTHLESS to sell such a low quality product to unsuspecting people who just want to own a memorable 1948 movie.  In the product details it says ""Studio: Terra"".  Whenever I buy another VHS tape, I will be looking for the name Terra or Terra Entertainment and avoiding it like the plague.  I only hope that someone comes out with a digitally re-mastered DVD version of this excellent movie.",1175126400,7,704,4.825
7995676,5,B0000A381Y,"Made in 1948 during the golden years of film noir, ""Ruthless"" was another low-budget gem directed by the great Edgar G. Ulmer, famous for the cult classic ""Detour"". It was released by the Poverty Row studio Eagle-Lion, the same studio responsible for B film noir classics such as ""He Walked by Night"", ""Hollow Triumph"" (AKA ""The Scar""), ""Raw Deal"", ""The Spiritualist"" (AKA ""The Amazing Mr. X""), and ""T-Men"". Edgar Ulmer considered this movie as his ""Citizen Kane"", and Ulmer fans will surely agree that this movie was much more ambitious and had a far more impressive cast than ""Detour"".

Zachary Scott stars as Horace Woodruff Vendig, a heartless cad who plots and schemes his way from the slums to the big time, eventually being in charge of a multi-million-dollar business industry. He uses everyone on his climb to the top, including three beautiful women, and then discards them when he's tired of them. His best friend Vic Lambdin (Louis Hayward) has known him since childhood, but it takes Vic a very long time before he realizes just how cold-blooded Horace is. Horace ruins the lives of everyone he comes in contact with, and eventually his wicked ways catch up with him as he realizes he has no one left to use.

""Ruthless"" was the perfect showcase for Zachary Scott, cinema's ""king of the cads"" in my opinion. He was a highly underated actor and appeared in numerous noir films, including classics like ""The Mask of Dimitrios"", ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Danger Signal"", ""The Unfaithful"", ""Flaxy Martin"", and ""Flamingo Road"". The rest of the cast in ""Ruthless"" was excellent as well and for a Poverty Row movie the list of stars was quite impressive: Louis Hayward, Diana Lynn, Sydney Greenstreet, Lucille Bremer, Martha Vickers, and an early appearance by Raymond Burr. This movie is a definite must for any film noir enthusiast. Let's hope a DVD release is not too far away.",1137801600,10,1879,4.887147335423197
