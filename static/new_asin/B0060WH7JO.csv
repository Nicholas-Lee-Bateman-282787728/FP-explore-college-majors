4924095,2,B0060WH7JO,"""I'm the son of two movie stars...that's like a super-duper movie star."" Bucky Larson (Swardson) is working as a bagger at a grocery store when he gets into a fight with his manager. Depressed, he goes to his friends house to watch a ""nude"" movie. When he sees his parents on the screen he finds his destiny. Going in I saw the reviews for this (2.2 out of 10 on IMDb, 33 out of 100 on Rotten Tomatoes) and I am usually skeptical of bad reviews. Like most good ones they tend to exaggerate how good or bad a movie is. This is did not. This is awful. A few funny parts mixed in with the same joke over and over and over. The best part of this movie hands down is Kevin Nealon but he is not in it enough. I will say that I have seen worse, but this is a movie that people will watch out of curiosity and may regret it. Overall, not the worst comedy I have seen, but without Nealon it may have been. I give it a D+.",1325635200,5,912,3.9351351351351354
4924096,5,B0060WH7JO,"I guess you either get this type of humour or you don't.
Personally, I loved it and Nick Swardson is a very funny man. Even here.
It wouldn't be unfair to say that by provoking such a strong negative reaction it almost hits John Waters territory.
Nothing can ever touch those early films, but this is so  against the grain it almost has to become a cult classic.
Am I lying?
I thought it was well acted and the production values are just fine, so if there's a problem, it's only with your taste buds. Maybe I'm an army of one, but I feel I must stand up and be counted. I will cast my vote by ordering the blu-ray asap.
In a perfect world this would be a franchise!",1321142400,10,665,4.115384615384615

And YES it is quite raunchy and absolutely funny as hell. I have never laughed so hard at anything in my whole life. It is corny but utterly unforgettable and gut busting. This movie is ate up and hilarious. It had my wife and I spitting soda out our noses. If you watch this and don't find it to be one of the funniest movies ever you must be a real boring bunghole.

4924138,3,B0060WH7JO,"The movie makes a prominent point about relationships, albeit somewhat hidden towards the end of the movie. Swardson and Sandler have been moving away from knee-slapping comedy and making films that are more message oriented. I am perplexed by some of the ""message"" which tends to be highly raunchy and out of my league, but I know going in that the content is going to be very liberal and frankly absurd. The Swardson/Sandler crew did much better with Jack and Larry or Grandma's Boy. Both were a lot funnier than this one. I am not a fan of alternative lifestyles or sex humor stemming from same, but I am open-minded enough to set aside my preferences for an hour or so. I wish it had been funnier. There was no DRIVE MONKEY DRIVE scene. What I did find was that beneath the unadulterated sickness, there was a message of honesty and love. If you are willing to watch, you might want to do so alone first. This is NOT a family movie, and I would not recommend watching it with parents, grandparents, pastors, priests, pizza delivery personnel or political pundits.

4924148,3,B0060WH7JO,"Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star is intended for people that like lots of sexual-related comedy.  Now I definitely fall into this category much to many peoples dissatisfaction but... when used in a comedy, the sex jokes need to be backed up with a solid storyline and interesting characters.  Unfortunately Bucky Larson doesn't contain either (despite how attractive Christina Ricci is of course!)

It's about the immature, unattractive, sex-happy character of Bucky Larson going to his friends house one evening as a way to discover himself shall we say, and upon watching a porno he recognizes the characters in the movie... because they are his *parents*.  Now wouldn't THAT be the ultimate surprise?  Not in a good way either!

After confronting his parents, Bucky realizes that he'd like to travel to Hollywood and make it big as a porn actor.  This is when the storyline gets going.  He meets several people including Christina Ricci at a diner and when Bucky realizes he has no place to go, Christina introduces Bucky to a roommate that's probably the funniest person in the entire movie because he's so incredibly direct and demanding that Bucky do whatever he says and that's that.  A segment involving Bucky seeing this man on the toilet is hilarious.

Ironically enough, Christina Ricci plays a normal and rational woman and not a quiet weirdo like in other movies!

Later on Bucky eventually finds himself in a porn audition after meeting the right people that give him the chance.  However everyone makes fun of his tiny man parts and laughs at his desire to be a legitimate porn actor based on his ugly and unsatisfying appearance.  The movie sort of falls into this seemingly constant pattern for an extended people of time and the storyline never accomplishes much as a result.  Plus the sex jokes reach a level of such mindlessness that you might be tempted to turn the movie off halfway through (and I wouldn't blame you if you did).

Overall, not enough substance from a storyline point of view, and Bucky's character is too dim-witted and clueless to really care about either.  I'm not a fan of Nick Swardson either so that certainly doesn't help.  I say skip it.",1364428800,,2182,4.82258064516129

4924152,3,B0060WH7JO,"This was a weird movie and the production cost 10 million. It was also from Adam Sandler's production. So for those who are tired of his ridiculous films like Jack and Jill,I completely understand. The lead actor is Bucky who is played by Sandler's protege Nick Swardson. He really is unfunny and cannot carry a movie even if his life depended on it. His best role was probably in Don't Mess with the Zohan.

This movie is kinda like Joe Dirt but with an R rating. The best roles come from washed up actors like Don Johnson,Stephen Dorf,Kevin Nealon,Nicholas Turturro. They carry the movie with their lines. Christina Ricci is the lead actress and she plays a happy low self esteem girl. Worth watching if you watch movies with Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill. There is nudity from female adult pornstars as well. Ido Mosseri from You don't mess with the Zohan stars as well as a producer. Very funny performance from him

The movie bombed at the box office and has an extremely low rating at IMDB.",1348358400,,992,4.567415730337078
4924153,5,B0060WH7JO,"I've seen alot of varying reviews for this movie, all the way from 1 star to a full 5 stars.  Well, I for one give BUCKY LARSON 5 stars without a moment's hesitation!  This is one those films that I found by accident and it pulled me in like a hungry fisherman reeling in a prized rainbow trout.  It had everything you could ask for in a film, a great star, NICK SWARDSON, great co-stars, DON JOHNSON, CHRISTINA RICCI,...and of course a poignant, sweet and funny story.  I can't say enough about how much I just loved this movie.  If you are feeling down, BUCKY LARSON will turn that frown upside down!  This movie really is uplifting.  It portrays a life that most people would kill for.  Bucky has parents who love him, neighbors who care about him, friends who want to help him, a girlfriend who would sacrifice everything for him, and why?  Well Bucky is just that awesome!  People question Nick Swardson's acting ability, well, I can't imagine that anyone else could have pulled this character off without being phony or smarmy.  Nick Swardson gave Bucky incredible charm, humanity, warmth, heart and likability, and to me, that is award winning acting!  Plus the co-stars were just a perfect addition.  Don Johnson and Christina Ricci were fantastic!  They were absolutely believable, sincere and likable.  I want them to be MY friends!  And Bucky's parents,...I love my parents but I would be honored to have Bucky's parents be my own.  I can go on and on here, but just take a look.  This is a fun movie, an enjoyable movie but most of all, a charming, heart-filled story.  Give it a try.  Get your friends over.  Get a bottle of whiskey.

What was clearly the 1st sign of what direction ""Bucky"" was heading into is when we saw an inbreed farmer (probably left over from Deliverance) smacked peanut butter all over his Junk so his goat could ""snack"" on it, this was still in the middle of the intro credits before we even get to Bucky himself. Once the Peanut Butter and Goat credits finally ended we see Bucky at his job as a grocery sacker at ""Fooders"" where his boss played by Curtis Armstrong (AKA Booger) fires poor Bucky (Not clear why but it does not really matter anyways). I'll skip over the dinner seen with Bucky's Parents and get to where Bucky goes to his friends house to watch a new movie.

I never truly recognized how bad the economy had gotten until watching Bucky, seeing good actors like Don Johnson, Christina Ricci, Stephen Doriff, Jimmy Fallen, Curtis Armstrong and Pauly Shore (Yes I said Pauly Shore, Bio-Dome was a park walk with what Nick Swardson did) give up what integrity they may have had to actually use their real names with this movie.

The really sad thing my son who is an Adam Sandler fan (as myself) is hoping that Adam just put his name on the script and can have plausible deniability that he had any ""creative input"" concerning this abomination. Before anybody says anything we are not defending the stuff that Adam has put out over the years but you can usually get a laugh even if it was unintentional. This cannot be said for this unholy horror. I'm just hoping after this Adam Sandler revives Rob Schneider's mediocre career, it will be a welcome site after seeing Nick's first starring role.

4924162,1,B0060WH7JO,"Another amateurish piece of cinematic trash from the Happy Gilmore writing desk of Adam Sandler and Nick Swardson. This not even remotely funny movie revolves around the adventures of the titular character Bucky Larson...who has buck teeth (hence the name Bucky, get it) a Dutch boy haircut, and a small penis. This Iowa dimwit (all Iowans are depicted as morons) heads for the bright lights of Hollywood to pursue a career as a porn star after discovering that both his parents were 70's porn stars. Many agonizing twists and turns later, Bucky rises to fame and has an unlikely romance with Kathy (Christina Ricci) a sweet waitress in a dismal diner.

Why such a talented actress would allow herself to appear in this stink-bomb remains a total mystery.

4924164,1,B0060WH7JO,"Synopsis:  Bucky Larson (played by Nick Swardson) is a man-child living in rural Iowa who believes he is destined for better things after getting fired from his job at the local grocery store.  During a night of fooling around with his friends, he finds found that his reserved parents Jeremiah (Edward Hermann) and Debbie (Miriam Flynn) were popular and prolific porn stars during the 1970s.  Inspired, Bucky packs up his things and moves to Los Angeles, where he plans on continuing the family legacy.  Though he knows no one in Los Angeles, a waitress by the name of Kathy McGee (Christina Ricci) takes him under her wing and ensures that he sees to it that his dreams are fulfilled.  Under the pressure to get money for his new roommate Gary (Kevin Nealon), Bucky tries to get into the adult business, but is publicly humiliated by his lack of endowment by the over-endowed Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff).  This doesn't dissuade down-and-out porn producer Miles Deep (Don Johnson) from attempting to make a buck off Bucky and his family's reputation, however, so he offers to make Bucky Larson ""a star.""  Will Miles regret taking a gamble on Bucky?  Will Bucky Larson be a star?  And if so, will Kathy accept who he is for who he is and take their relationship to the next level?  Pauly Shore and Jimmy Fallon make cameo appearances.

The premise is convoluted and it seems odd that everyone in Bucky's life is so nonchalant about his newfound choice of vocation. BThe movie followed a lot of the humor that the other Happy Madison films followed and the acting as a whole seemed rather weak.  Kevin Nealon is singlehandedly the reason why I would even consider watching this film again.  Had he not played the role of Gary, I could see myself enjoying this as much as I would have enjoyed a root canal.  I was expecting more with that kinda star power.

Members of the 18-35 crowd who like to party while watching movies may find something worthwhile in watching this.  Anyone else, however, probably wouldn't enjoy it enough to watch, let alone own or rent.",1328486400,2,2060,4.696378830083566
4924165,1,B0060WH7JO,"If you haven't heard of Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star, then you are extremely fortunate. Considering it only made about $2.5 million in box office receipts and left theaters after two weeks, it's an understandable oversight. Produced by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison studio, the film stars comic Nick Swardson as the titular Bucky, a man-child who discovers his uptight parents were once famous porn stars. With this newfound knowledge, Bucky decides to follow in his parents' footsteps and sets his sights on Hollywood, where his small genitalia make him a popular gimmick. There's more to the story, but it's really not worth getting into. This aggressively unfunny and severely misguided comedy is the worst movie I saw in 2011; do what you will with that information.",1328054400,6,772,5.0390625

This movie was very funny!

It's part of the joke, I get it.  The problem was the story, it was just flat.  I honestly was able to tell what was going to happen five minutes before it happened as it became cliched.  The loser becomes a hero.  There was no real original level of comedy here.  I don't give it a 0 star like many had.  But I can't give it a positive as the writers didn't come up with anything fresh as far as the jokes go.  You pretty much see the movie in the trailer.",1327017600,2,604,3.925619834710744

Fine, how's a 9/100 metacritic rating for you?  I wouldn't be surprised if nobody hires this director again, not even for a youtube video.

Do not purchase this film based on people giving it 5 star and 4 star reviews.  That's saying that there's no movie better.  Check other sources first if you're on the fence.  This movie should have never been made.",1326758400,13,857,4.426751592356688

If you really like Ed Wood movies, precisely because they are terrible, then you are Bucky-ready. If not, and even the most hilariously wretched movies just seem plain bad to you, then please move on to the next film. But if you like 'em so bad they're good, then here you go...

Bucky Larson is now infamous for being the lowest rated Rotten Tomato of them all: zero percent thumbs up! So I was expecting the worst film ever made, which some reviewers claim Bucky is. But let me damn them with some faint praise for Bucky (that will probably be the only Shakespeare reference ever made within ten miles of this film).

Is this film ""good""? No. But, it was never meant to be. It's clearly an uber-parody, a satire about how bad movies can be, especially romantic comedies. I think a lot of people miss that, or just didn't see enough of the truly execrable romcoms that came out from about 1974-1992 or so. Some of those films were so bad because they thought they were kinda good. Not in this case! Bucky takes every trope and cliche from bad comedies and milks them, as it were, until they cover the wall. It's even got a Journey song during the final ""they-get-together-forever"" scene. Now that's the romcom seal of approval. And don't forget that Adam Sandler is one of the writers, so Citizen Kane is not exactly on the radar...

I love to laugh in general, so I was ready to take what came my way here. The thing most miss is that this film actually has a pretty good heart; they could have gone for meaner laughs but didn't, which makes this almost kind of gee shucksy at points. And frankly, there were more laughs than expected. Kevin Nealon is very funny at moments, as is Swardson, simply because he is such a truly weak actor. He knows it and works with it and it works...but once again, only if you like that extra layer of So Bad It's Ridiculous/Stupid/Funny. Ricci plays it straight and gives this the slight veneer of normal movie it needs to ""succeed"" (at not succeeding, that is). Don Johnson is suitably silly; think Burt Reynolds circa 1980. He adds that layer of perno sleaze that defines what this flick is playing against, and once again, if you don't see the fun in that, then save yourself the 90 minutes.

But if you've ever suffered through a really lame chick flick, and can laugh at yourself for putting up with it, you'll enjoy this for all the right/wrong reasons.",1326153600,,2406,4.4840182648401825
