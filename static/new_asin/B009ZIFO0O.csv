5374166,5,B009ZIFO0O,"and that's not easy considering I am now on my 80th K-drama.  This drama has superb acting (great chemistry between the 2 Leads), music, cinematography and superb directing.  One reviewer skipped the historical parts of this show while watching.  That's a shame.  Whether a drama stays true to historical facts or not, the historical parts here added to the authentication of this ""time travel"" drama.  Lastly, too often as viewers, we fail to give credit to the Cutting/Editing Team.  Here, they have done an outstanding job ... the Time Travel here is so seamless.  K-drama fans are aware of the fast-pace, nonstop filming once a drama is started.  Kudos to the Team and the Director for paying great attention to this not-too-small detail (editing).",1367020800,,752,5.008064516129032

I went into Marathon Mode as this story unfolded, immersing me in the chemistry, the romance the two lead actors shared-- The fascinating parallels of time travel-- of changing history-- the results of ""Cause&Effect,"" the Consequences of time travel, Are ALL Explored in this UNFORGETTABLE Korean Drama that had me in tears (especially the last episode). I'm SO HAPPY I BOUGHT This One!! I rarely have any desire to watch Korean drama's more than once, and can think of only two exceptions (both starring So-Ji Sub), BUT THIS ONE I WILL Watch Over And Over Again And Again!!

5374186,5,B009ZIFO0O,"Time travel themes offer movie directors a chance to mingle hard science with fantasy. In QUEEN AND I, the viewer gets several genres in one film. There is, of course, time travel itself, a concept that opens the door to parallel universes and altered history. Then there is fantasy allied with the supernatural. Finally there is romance liberally sprinkled with comedy, drama, and tragedy. It is rare that any film can successfully pull off such a union. Earlier Korean time-travel movies like DR. JIN, FAITH, and ROOFTOP PRINCE managed to do so, and now you can add QUEEN AND I to this short list.

The parallel plots involve a very unsuccessful actress Choi Hee Jin (Yoo-In Na) who has recently broken up with her far more successful actor ex-boyfriend Han Dong Min (Kim Jin Woo). The latter wants to revive his philandering ways with her by recommending her for a part in a historical saga about Joseon's royalty of the 17th century. Dong Min is a colossal jerk, an arrogant playboy who wants only what he cannot have. The other half of the plot centers on a martial artist scholar who lives 300 years from the present. He is Kim Bong Do (Ji Hyun Woo) a classy gentleman who is trying to survive in a court where fatal intrigues are the norm. A geisha gives him what she calls a ""charm"" which is a slip of paper containing words which when spoken aloud permit him to be whisked away into the time stream to 21st century Korea. Further, if Kim Bong Do is threatened with immediate violent death, the charms also kicks in to plunge him into the future. Since this time travel movie does not rely on the mechanics of tachyons or black holes to move the hero about from one century to another, the audience soon enough accepts the credibility of Kim Bong Do as a Korean In King Arthur's Court. Bong Do is unfailingly polite, inventive, erudite, and a generally upbeat guy with whom the viewer instantly bonds.

When Bong Do is whisked into the future for the first of various round trip journeys, he meets Choi Hee Jin, who immediately begins picking on him by calling him ""player,"" a term that he does not understand. Much of the first half of the movie mixes comedy with palpable romance as Bong Do is portrayed as a Joseon-era fish out of historical waters. He looks, judges, and evaluates all that he sees and looks astonishingly good as he does so. Choi Hee falls for him in a big way. Her ex-boyfriend Dong Min does his level best to break them up. Choi Hee's manager, the annoyingly whiny Jo Soo-kyung (Ga Deuk-Hee) provides comic relief with her whininess.

The world of comedy/romance is often separated only by the thinness of the charm that symbolizes the unforeseen consequences of time travel. More than once is Bong Do warned that this charm is far more than an unpunched bus ticket between far flung destinations. Small changes in the past are magnified over the centuries so even future human memories are subject to temporal alteration. His past life centers on his loyalty to the Queen whose very life may be threatened by his temporal travels. His future life similarly centers on his growing love for Choi Hee Jin. To his immense sorrow, he slowly accepts that he cannot have both. Prioritization leads to choices, both of which involve a vicarious audience identification, a process that causes that audience to root for him despite the emerging obstacles.

The casting for QUEEN AND I is superb. The secondary actors are totally believable, especially the geisha who clearly loves Bong Do and is willing to sacrifice her own happiness for his, even if it means a happiness with a future female. The chemistry between the leads is undeniable, and in real life they fell in love during the filming. What emerges after a sixteen episode run is a magnificent exhibition of how fantasy is carried off so well that the audience eagerly accepts a willing suspension of disbelief to involve themselves in the vagaries of time travel. Highly recommended.",1406678400,2,3967,4.7118155619596545
5374187,5,B009ZIFO0O,The best k-drama of 2012!,1406073600,,25,4.2
5374188,5,B009ZIFO0O,"Love it!!! Favorite k-drama by far... Excellent quality . .. And excellente translation,... The package is gorgeous... Really satisfied with everything...",1400976000,,154,6.380952380952381
5374189,3,B009ZIFO0O,"I absolutely adore this drama & recommend watching it if you happened to have not seen it yet. However, I cannot recommend buying this DVD set. I have watched this drama a few times on viki & loved it so much, for the 1st time ever, I bought a kdrama on DVD. I made a mistake in not opening & watching it immediately though because I am now unable to return it. I purchased this in February 2014 but just opened it today (May 6).

The problem is the sound quality, which is way off. The sound issue is apparent as soon as the voiceover begins in ep 1. The sound is a bit muffled and slightly faster than normal. It almost sounds as if it is dubbed but it would not make sense to dub Korean in Korean & (some of) the voices sound too similar to the actors' real voices to be dubbed. However, the sound is off enough to detract from the enjoyability of the show. I tried the DVD in several different devices, including an Apple & a Dell computer, a DVD player & a play station--They all sound the same which leads me to conclude it's the DVD w/the problem.

On a positive note, the subtitles appear to be solid. I saw a few very minor grammatical errors and a word missing from the translation here or there but nothing that detracted from a viewer's ability to understand what was going on.

Update: I have watched the other discs & the sound problem is limited to the first disc & improves as time passes. The first episode is the worst in terms of the issue. I now suspect disc one is defective. Perhaps all of the DVD box sets are not like this, especially considering no other review mentions a sound quality issue on here.",1399334400,8,1626,4.2387096774193544
5374190,1,B009ZIFO0O,Why does it cost 41 $ I mean I watched the whole series for free on viki with English subtitles so 41 $ seems really far fetched. More like ridiculous actually. I do love the show tho but I wouldn't spend that much money on something you could watch for free on the internet.,1396656000,,275,4.111111111111111

5374192,5,B009ZIFO0O,"I have been watching Korean drama for about six years now.  I have watch lots and lots of them.  This one is one of the best.  The lead couple are so cute together.  They are a real couple too in their real life. It is just a cute, sweet drama.  If you like Korean romance/comedy drama you will love this one.",1395014400,,309,4.0

5374195,5,B009ZIFO0O,"Lovely mix of romance, historical political intrigue and a sweet sane caring and hot relationship between the leads.  Highly recommended.  Subtitles were not as good as the fansubs, but luckily I had read detailed recaps so that did not bother me.  A keeper in my library.",1380412800,3,272,4.869565217391305
5374196,5,B009ZIFO0O,"I went on a spree last year, watching several time-travel-themed programs, and this one was among the best. In a genre fraught with science errors and truck-sized plot holes -- just the nature of the genre -- this one used Buddhist-related magic/magical realism to cover most of those problems. What helps this story stand out is the male lead, who portrays Kim Boong Do, a fictional scholar and administrator, who aids the real Queen Inhyun 300 years in the past, as well as meeting and falling in love with an actress portraying the queen in a modern television drama. The story doesn't work if the viewer can't believe Kim Boong Do, and the actor ""sells it"". Caught up in the story, I can believe he is a scholar who is thrust centuries into the future, and I can believe that he takes this absurdity in stride. He looks on the world -- his own, and this strange new place -- with amusement and wonder, and adapts to both worlds as he slides between them, learning modern ways while dealing with historical changes.

There's humor and history, sword fights and romance, palace intrigue and comic pratfalls. Something for everyone.

5374199,4,B009ZIFO0O,"Since I seem to not be able to get enough of the Korean dramas, I purchased this one even though it was going to have our current time, 2012, a majority of the time. At first I was not hooked, but it didn't take long and I just couldn't stop at just one episode.",1373241600,,262,3.8703703703703702
5374200,4,B009ZIFO0O,I enjoyed this drama - I was needing something on the lighter side - too many sad ones.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Hadn't seen the male lead before but he was adorable.  The main actress was the roommate in Secret Garden and she did a good job carrying the movie - I don't think you can go wrong with this drama.,1372809600,12,316,4.064516129032258
5374201,5,B009ZIFO0O,"I have been asking for this dvd for birthday and christmas and mothers day since it came out in an international viewing edition.  This show hits every sweet spot, and I wish drama producers would take note.  The time travel actually makes sense.  The female lead is not helpless.  The male lead is smart and kind (no prickly bickering full of hate turned into love business here).  You even have to like the conceited ex-boyfriend character.  I know the ending was a bit controversial, but it is worth every minute.  There are scenes of love and bonding that you will want to replay over and over again.  This is a video you will want to own, so you can watch whenever you need a pick-me-up.",1369440000,20,692,4.48

8545664,5,B009ZIFO0O,"The drama itself is hugely popular even after almost 5 years.  I've watched it more than a half dozen times with subs from both Viki and DramaFever.  Viki's was better.  This was purchased from a 3rd party seller, so I was cautiously optimistic and thankfully it was a keeper.  Picture quality was as original.  The subs were a bit different.  Since I've watched it so many times, it was interesting to see the different interpretation.  Nothing earth shattering, just a different take on translation and they censored the one swear word.  There were a few syntax and tense errors, nothing un-understandable. They consistently messed up though when there were 2 people talking and the dialogue of one continued into the next screen.  The other person's dialogue appeared with the continuation of the first person's sentence appearing underneath it. This edition was distributed by a Malaysian company called PMP.",1490745600,2,912,5.108108108108108

I would give it 10 stars if possible. Let me say that I usually do not like watching a show with subtitles. However, the actors and actresses in this show made every moment worthwhile. Yoo In-na and Ji Hyun-Woo make an adorable couple, and most of their scenes together make me laugh. The supporting cast members are funny and zany. I am sure to rewatch this show when I want to laugh. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a Korean drama full of magic and comedy. =)",1437955200,,652,4.352459016393443
