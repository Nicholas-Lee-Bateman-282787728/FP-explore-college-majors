[A note on the price of this tape. This tape is out of print and was never released as other than a video store copy (meaning the price was kept high). This is a difficult tape to find. If you look at the auction sites and are patient, you may be able to find one for $10.00 or less (if you pay any more than that, you are paying too much). To keep you from getting a thousand hits by searching for 'midnight' in VHS, use the search words 'midnight' and 'russo' in an item description search. Keep in mind Amazon.com does have an auction area.]-Bob",1097798400,8,2696,4.319526627218935
1203071,3,B00000F50O,Midnight is an adaptation of a novel written by the director John Russo.  I have not read his book but the movie is an enjoyable cheesy slasher film.

1203072,1,B00000F50O,"Midnight (John Russo, 1982)

Oh, John Russo. I loved your novels when I was a teenager. I had every one of them. (In fact, I had them all up until a few years ago, and even now, I've only sold one.) When I first heard that two of them, Midnight and The Majorettes, had been turned into films, I champed at the bit to see them; after all, they're two of my three favorites. Let me ask you something. No, let me plead with you. If you ever decide that Black Cat needs a film adaptation-- and it surely does-- can you please, please allow an indie company with a proven track record to do it? Because I'm sorry, but your movies are nowhere near as good as your novels, no matter how many Night of the Living Dead alumni you rope in to help.

The story: after an opening scene that will make no sense to you until we're long into spoiler territory, we are introduced to Nancy Johnson (Melanie Verlin), a teen who's finally had more than enough of home life after her constantly-drunk stepfather puts the moves on her (again, we are led to infer). She runs away, gets picked up by a couple of college boys headed for Florida, and goes along for the ride. All goes well until the teen trio decide to stop and heist groceries in the wrong small town, running afoul of local law enforcement and a deranged family of Satan-worshippers. (Yes, there's a connection, but how, I can't tell you.) Meanwhile, the stepfather (Lawrence Tierney, surely in the nadir of his career), having sobered up and realized what a donkey he's been, sets off to find his stepdaughter, beg her forgiveness, and get her to come home.

It really is a good book. Yeah, it's cheesy as all get-out, but hey, it's an eighties horror novel, what do you expect? It's got all the trappings you need for a good, quick read, doesn't require any mental effort, and is as predictable and oddly satisfying as any Harlequin romance, just with a lot more blood. But you take a genre potboiler and add a film crew for whom ""amateur"" would be putting it mildly, and you've got something... well, awful. The acting is atrocious, even from the legendary Tierney. The direction is about what you'd expect from a guy working on no budget and doing his second feature, but without any of the zeal that has been so thankfully present in many of today's microbudget horror flicks. (Okay, ""many"" may be pushing it, but there have certainly been a few.) The soundtrack, well, it must be heard to be believed.

I can't even consider recommending this to anyone but the most rabid John Russo completist. And that would be me. I assume, since you're reading this, that you're probably #2 or #3 on the list (how many of us can there possibly be?). Trust me-- I watched this so you don't have to. *",1207008000,,2735,4.442231075697211
1203073,1,B00000F50O,"John Russo wrote co-wrote a little chiller called ""Night Of The Living Dead"" and then turned to writing books. Among them a novelization of that movie and then he wrote several good ""pulp"" horror novels that were gory and always ended very bleakly. I read them all(and past them on to friends in school,yes in the 80's we did read books that weren't on a list of ""have to"" by the school system) and I thought that ""Midnight"" was one of the better ones he wrote. It was dark , scary, and had one scene in it that chilled me to the 13 year old bones when I read it. So watch this movie was a slam dunk,I mean the Author wrote and Directed it, what could go wrong?  EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  The plot was hacked to pieces(yes I know , the pun was meant), and in it's place was put a basic slasher movie. What's that smell it's this movie on the bottom of my shoe! Just awful!!!!!!!!!!!

  If you can find it at a used book store somewhere,get the book and see what this could have been. Really , READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1175040000,,1061,4.494791666666667

1203075,1,B00000F50O,"What I originally sought out to get when I rented this was the 1981 slasher ""Midnight Evil"", which is what I thought this was. When I read the synopsis on the back of the box, however, I saw that this was an entirely different movie. But it sounded so exciting, I decided to get it anyway. I was expecting a raw, brutal Hills Have Eyes/Texas Chainsaw Massacre type thing. In alot of ways, it is, buts its totally devoid of scares. There is a family of giggly crazy, satanic kooks who terroize and murder innocent people in the muddy backwoods of Pennsylvania to please thier dead mother. The main victims are a group of ""teens""--2 guys and a girl--traveling around in a blue van who shoplift groceries on thier way to Florida. The girl Nancy, who we are soppoused to believe is 17 years but looks like a 35 year old housewife, is running away from her stepfather who tried to rape her. It's a confused, dim, very poorly made piece of trash free of any scares with unimpressive though bloody kills. It literally looks as if a young college film student assembled a bunch of friends and family members together and pieced together a project in his spare time using a cheap camera with alot of cherry Kool-Aid on hand (though the special effects are soppousedly Tom Savaini's doing. He should be ashamed). The climatic satanic ritual scene looks like it was taken right out of an Ed Wood film. All this is soppoused to be taking place around Easter, but this was obviously shot in the middle of fall. I could go on and on about this films ineptness, but all I really have to tell you is that it's a waste of time.",1151193600,2,1610,4.4425675675675675
1203076,1,B00000F50O,"The only halfway decent thing about this film is the makeup FX by Tom Savini, and even those aren't terrific.  Terrible acting, poor script, weak story, the list of problems goes on. A film entirely populated by ugliness, even the female lead in this one is so unattractive it makes one ask why the step-dad would even bother in the first place?!

1203077,1,B00000F50O,"I've searched the English language and cannot find a word that truly describes how awful this movie is. Don't spend a penny to buy or rent it, if a friend has it and wants you to watch it, say no.

The plot is a girl runs away from home and is picked up by two guys. They run into a family of satanists who kills the guys and take the girl prisoner. Her stepfather, the reason she ran away in the first place, is searching for her.

The acting is, well, suffice it to say these people are not, nor never will be actors. The plot is thin and idiotic, the dialogue is unbelievably  poorly written, the direction is incompetent. I don't think it's possible for this movie to be worse than it is.",1149897600,,692,4.149253731343284
1203078,1,B00000F50O,"MIDNIGHT is one bad movie.  The script by novelist John Russo is derivative and unsuspenseful.  Former 40s actor Lawrence Tierney suffers through his role as the libidinous stepfather who is called upon to rescue her from a family of Satanists.  As in many of these early 80s films, the production is cheesily filmed, with a ridiculously corny soundtrack.  The rest of the cast is pretty bad, and the ending sort of just happens.

Not a good representation of horror films and not really worth seeing.",1143936000,,501,4.847058823529411

It left you without any type of a climax! Now i love both films 'JUST BEFORE DAWN'&'SLAUGHTERHOUSE' but its almost like some shmucks collected all the scraps off the cutting room floor of those gems & came up with 'MIDNIGHT'.

A teen-age girl runs away from home and is picked up by 2 guys in a van and they all 3 meet up with a family of Satanic killers. Pretty suspenseful in parts.

7906963,3,B00000F50O,"I am now officially convinced that if you're looking for the weirdest, most ridiculous, and often most unintentionally hilarious horror films of days gone by, you'll find they were made in Western Pennsylvania by George Romero's friends and previous co-workers (Flesheater, The Majorettes, Special Effects, Heartstopper). ""Midnight"" is another of these. It is one of John Russo's films (he was really the only member of Romero's group to ever have any career AT ALL in film) with the exception of Tom Savini, of course. This film is based on one of his novels, the majority of which were made into super low budget films. Coincidentally, ""Midnight"" is one of the only films Russo himself actually directed, and to be honest, it's not as horrible as I anticipated. That's no rave review, but if you've seen any of those other films i listed, you'd expect ""Midnight"" to be some pretty horrible filmmaking. Aside from the obvious budget problems, unbelievably horrible music, and some questionable dialogue, the film is an interesting idea that is competently filmed and acted (well enough). It's not scary, and I have a feeling it never was, but it has a certain charming creepiness that kept my attention.
The plot is almost irrelevant, it's basically your run of the mill slasher, masquerading with a thin ""satanist cult"" explanation that was ever so popular in 80's culture (everyone thought satanists were everywhere). A group of travelers running from the cops stop in a rural county full of racist psychopaths, where several murders have been happening...and surprise...these young travelers are next on the list.
 For the price, it's worth a view. But, make no mistake, this is one low budget, dated film. It doesn't hold up as much more than a curiosity. But, for those wondering what was the *best* Russo could create post-""night of the living dead""...i'm pretty sure this is it.",1496361600,2,1886,5.02555910543131

7906966,1,B00000F50O,"After hearing Sam Sherman mention John Russo's Midnight on my umpteenth viewing of another movie released by Independent -International, I decided to grab a copy at what seemed like a bargain price.
I'm staggered by how amateurish it is.
Aside from Lawrence Tierney (who is terrible) the other actors don't seem to be trained professionals.
It seems as though absolutely no effort was expended making this mess. The opening scene, featuring children who are clearly dressed in late 70s clothes, turns out to be a flashback from decades earlier.
The female lead-- in her first scene I thought she was a boy (the haircut, clothes, and schlubby body language don't help).
Not only does it compare poorly with similar, modern films made by complete amateurs at a fraction of the cost, but this worthless, boring waste of time is especially disappointing in that it was made by one of the men behind Night if the living Dead at the end of a decade that gave us Texas Chainsaw and Last House on the Left.
I'm amazed even Sam Sherman thought it was worth releasing, and it wound up in Lion's Gate's clutches. The DVD opens with their logo, giving it a slight air of legitimacy.

7906967,4,B00000F50O,"""Night of the Living Dead"" remains one of my favorite films and while I've followed George Romero's subsequent career, until recently, I didn't know much about ""Night's"" coauthor, John Russo (other than his involvement with the exceptional ""Return of the Living Dead).
""Midnight"" is no ""Night"" or ""Return"" but it is an intriguing film in its own way. The writing is strong (until the ill-fitting end, which betrays the film in many ways) and the overall atmosphere is like a creepy bad dream with distorted religious imagery and an anti-social world view. It's LOW budget so there are certainly some kills and stunts that could've been greatly improved with more money, but I figure if you've gone this far down the rabbit whole of b-80's cinema that you're searching out a movie like this, you know what you're in for.
