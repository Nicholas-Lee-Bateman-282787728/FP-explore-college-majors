So disappointed to have waisted money on this!",1467849600,,214,4.2439024390243905

8037486,2,B00062IWVQ,"We are visiting California later this year so I wanted to show my daughter some of the parks. The video was of horrible production, basically a bad home video. What made it worst was the fact that the video kept stopping. I restarted my ROKU box and still had problems. I never wanted my money back before, but this sure would warrant that. I would of given it one star but I don't like to use the word hate.",1392249600,,408,4.177215189873418
8037487,5,B00062IWVQ,I bought this dvd as a reminder of my times spent in california and its theme parks. As some of my friends have not been as fortunate as me to visit such a wonderfull state they have watched the dvd with me and enjoyed at least in film some of california's amazing attractions. The dvd arrived on time and in perfect condition.,1382918400,,327,4.290322580645161
8037488,2,B00062IWVQ,"The footage in this video was a little rough around the edges,
yet it was still a fun DVD to pop in to watch.  It featured
a good mixture of attractions.... Too bad it wasn't shot in
HD, but no film is perfect.

Overall, I'm satisfied with this one, but it definitely
could have been better.",1337990400,,291,4.178571428571429
8037489,2,B00062IWVQ,"I don't want to ""diss"" this product or it's filmmakers, however, I've gotta say please, please, please invest in a newer camera for taping (was this 8MM???), and PLEASE use a tripod or some type of stabilizer next time if your hands are so shakey.

Thanks.",1198886400,4,256,4.565217391304348
