8286976,4,B001CD514O,"If you have an opportunity to watch this documentary I highly recommend it. It is not an over the top sappy tribute to mankind but rather a gritty tells-it-like-it-is piece on the will and determination of a group of disabled people following a dream. I cant imagine just how hard it would be trudging day after day trying to make it to Mt Everest base camp yet alone someone with one arm, or one leg or being a paraplegic and trying to navigate a wheelchair in this terrain. You will see it, not everyone makes it and yet everyone is a winner. I shook my head on more then one occasion. The Sherpa alone would have made a hell of a story! It does run a tad long; could have benefited from some stronger editing and it would have been nice to see more of Gary Guller's attempt to summit at the end. This is just my opinion. The film is presented in a 4X3 aspect ratio and has L-R Dolby sound and has a run time of approximately 111 minutes. The image is sharp and very easy to watch. Dialogue is very clear and easy to understand. Buy it, rent it, watch it!",1222387200,3,1057,4.186274509803922
8286977,5,B001CD514O,"Everyone has at least one ""Mt. Everest"" in their life.  This film will inspire each of us to climb our own and help those around us to climb theirs.  And just as in the film, you need not make your journey alone.

In seeing how these climbers faced their challenges, you will learn how to face your own -- the ones you have been avoiding.

To ""top it off"" the film shows the rugged beauty of the mountains and beauty of the people that make them their home.",1216425600,,457,4.159090909090909
