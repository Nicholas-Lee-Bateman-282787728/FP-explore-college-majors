897110,5,6304542852,"I just watched The War At Home.  This story is very well written, acted & directed.  It makes you care for all the characters, and understand what each one is feeling and going through.  Not just with what is said, but more importantly, what is not said.  The movie gives us a small glimpse of what the Heroic and Brave men went through after returning from the Vietnam War.  I myself do not care for war movies, but I could not stop watching.  I gave this review five stars because it truly deserves it!  I also love that the story is character driven, and does not for one minute rely on special effects.  There are a few scenes that were VERY tastefully done, and I did not need to look away once.  I highly recommend it.  Rarely do I cry during movies, but this really touched my heart, as it will yours. Martin Sheen, Emilio Estevez, Kathy Bates & Kimberly Williams really give great performances.  Directed by Emilio Estevez.",1051315200,8,931,4.449704142011834
897111,5,6304542852,"This is an unforgettable film, by great performances from Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen, Kimberly Williams, and Emilio Estevez. This timeless story is of a Vietnam veteran who has an equally difficult time adjusting to returning home as his family does. There have been many movies that depict the horror many vets and their families have had to endure. The difference, `The War at Home' is so natural and well acted that is difficult to separate fact from fiction. You believe this is the family next door. Estevez directed as well as stared in this 1996 intense drama. For those who are sensitive to the plight of the Vietnam veteran, or this subject matter, this might be to intense. It is haunting and unforgettable. Without question an excellent movie brilliantly acted.",1046822400,5,771,4.938461538461539
897112,5,6304542852,"I really liked this movie and was very disappointed that the
studio did not promote it.  Everyone in the cast was excellent.
The subject matter was handled with honest emotions and reactions.
Emilio Estevez did a great job acting and directing.
Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates....wonderful.
High Recommend it!!",1033862400,,307,5.26530612244898
897113,4,6304542852,"Kathy Bates and Martin Sheen are excellent as oblivious parents in this film about a family torn apart from the inside but completely not dealing with their problems. Emilio Estevez is a son who returns from Vietnam and obviously has some real psychological problems and cannot reintegrate himself into society and definitely not into family life. His father tries to gloss over the problems and thinks Estevez can be ""normal"" again if only he will go out and get a job. Bates is totally oblivious and the overbearing and overprotective and overly sensitive mother. The story is actually fairly complex emotionally and is surprising considering that Emilio Estevez directed. Not a great movie, but not a bad one either. What can I say? When we rent videos in Iceland we rent a new film and get to choose an old one free... this was a free one. It is always a pleasant surprise when the free one turns out to be something worthwhile. Happily, also, this film does not have a happy ending.",982368000,3,987,4.710982658959537
897114,4,6304542852,"I rented this video because it deals with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder,  a relatively common and severe psychiatric disorder which doesn't get as  much ""press"" as other ailments such as depression and phobias  (not to minimize those conditions). It's extremely well-done, with many  nuances to the family dynamics written very accurately; the characters are  played extremely well by the various actors. The whole thing was, insofar  as it dealt with this issue in the context of a Vietnam vet, almost  flawless until the ending, which didn't make as much sense to me as the  rest of the story. In addition, I was disappointed by the somewhat flippant  conclusion when the main character's sister says in a voiceover that Emilio  Estevez's character will be fine, and eventually he was. I would give my  right arm for a movie which depicted realistically the recovery process for  someone suffering from PTSD. I realize you can only make one movie at a  time, and this movie was not about that, but it's still something I would  love to see and I hope someone out there decides to take on this project.",967680000,,1104,4.865591397849462
897115,5,6304542852,"This is really good movie that shows the backside of war, and the love of people that is trying to help, when the help you get is wrong kind. And you only know what is missing. "" They will never understand what's going  on inside me"".",952214400,,234,4.086956521739131

897117,5,6304542852,"As a peace time veteran I have always been interested in the elements that made up the Vietnam war.  No movie spoke to me more than Born on the Fourth of July because it explored the naive patriotism so often held by the young  and inexperienced (such as I) and the disillusionment born of societal  apathy and disdain as well as the pathetic way our vets are 'cared for' and  utterly disregarded by the military itself.  That's not an endorsement of  the Vietnam war itself but merely a commentary on the condition of our so  underappreciated veterans.
That being said 'The War at Home' explores  (quite adeptly if I might add) many of the psychological effects suffered  by those brave men and women who so gallantly served in addition to the  heartache and responsibility of the families involved.
It's a masterful  work.  Unfortunately most who have never served or put their own well being  on the line for a cause they believe in can not even begin to understand or  empathize with the inner plight of the Vietnam veteran.
A must see film!",915753600,9,1045,4.639344262295082

897313,5,6304542852,"This movie is seriously underrated. Hollywood must have screwed Emilio Estevez on this one (by not promoting the film) because it was dramatic, scary, and told a story of what many soldiers have to face when they come back from war. This war was Vietnam but it's just as applicable to today's dirty wars (all for profit). Highly Recommended film. One of my favorites from Emilio.",1406678400,2,379,4.757575757575758
897314,5,6304542852,"This movie is so, so real. I do not know how this movie did not become talked about in a big way... it is truly a sleeper. The plot and all the actors are truly amazing and a story we ALL need to see. Understanding is key to our humanness and this gives understanding to the Vietnam War Heroes who returned and their families in a way untold anywhere else. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough... it will change you: as a parent, as a US citizen, as a human being. There are levels of depth you will note in parenting, human nature, self concern, the way we relate, and the 'normalcy' of our American way...  The Vietnam War was different from the previous wars our country had fought.... and these people who fought it were exposed to tragedy that we, who were safe at home, could never realize... Emilio Estevez (director and actor), his father-Martin Sheen, Kathy Bates (who as an actor is and has been the apple of my eye) and Kimberly Williams: all gave savvy & intelligent performances of their career.

897315,5,6304542852,"Emilio Estevez directs and stars in this very powerful, very well acted, intelligent, wrenching movie on family relationships, war and its effect on one's soul and how one survives - or not. Estevez's real-life father Martin Sheen also stars along with Kathy Bates and Kimberly Williams. All give excellent performances but Estevez's haunted portrayal of a returned Vietnam vet stands out. That does not take away from any of the other actors who are outstanding. In my opinion it is a better film about the effects of war on one's psyche than 'Apocalypse Now'. The War At Home is unforgettable.",1400457600,4,595,4.96

897379,1,6304542852,great actors.  last scenes were overblown in my opinion.  story applicable to times and understanding the Vietnam war vet's concerns were applicable.  the lack of connection in the family was so vicarious and sadly so true in many homes even today.,1346716800,2,248,5.0
897380,5,6304542852,"The film is accurate and shows the dynamics of the family, the secrets in the family are front and center, that's what many recoil from in this story. The women who started Mother's Day fought to keep their sons from becoming cannon fodder, now mothers don't tell their sons, ""don't go"" to a war in a country that isn't attacking us, fathers didn't say ""don't go"", here's some money to go to Canada.

The returning soldier in these types of families after the horrors they saw now have to be confronted with the cowardice of mom, dad and sister. He can't pretend this is the Norman Rockwell family unit anymore. The facade is forever undone. The parents can't face what they did so the son will have to pay. Many families were like this and they will never come to terms with it while their children will never get the healing they might have if truth telling could be done.

It is one of the most powerful films that's deals with the essence of why Vietnam tore us apart. There's no justice, there is just us.

What we don't remember, we will never forget and we will never be able to talk about it. This film opens a door to the that which we don't want to talk about. It is courageous and it is emotionally devastating to know how many families have never dealt with the fact they simply allowed their children to be carted off as cannon fodder to the hot steaming jungles of Vietnam. Not only allowed but when their children came back, turned on them, ostracized them, kicked them out of the family thus shredding the family finally and forever.

Get this film, weep and let it lead to some kind of healing.",1342483200,5,1611,4.414141414141414

897383,5,6304542852,"The War at Home is an underrated drama. It's SO good. It's so intense and wonderfully directed by Emilio Estevez. It's a shame it's gotten so little recognition. Hopefully with the release of his new film, people will realize how good a writer/director/actor he is.

This is an intense movie filled with Oscar worthy performances, especially from Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates.

Please buy this film and support Estevez' work. The bluray itself is great. Good picture quality. Too bad about the barebone release but still glad I got the bluray instead of the dvd.",1319414400,3,562,4.905263157894737

897465,5,6304542852,This is a movie that all families should watch. It gives a window into the mind of each family member as they try to come to terms with the devastating effects that war has on their returning war veteran. A powerful film.,1243987200,,221,4.285714285714286
897466,4,6304542852,"This DVD covers many emotions (Albeit sometimes a little dramatic) that the returning Vet feels. It was about Viet-Nam but the current conflicts may well apply as well in that the characters are still very much present. Here is what I am talking about:
1. An extremely jingoistic father who ridicules instead of supports.
2. A doting mother who thinks if you ignore what happened or kiss the situation to make it better it will all go away and be like it never happened.
3. A family member who is close to the same age who sits on the other side of the fence politically (Liberal who hasn't got a clue)
4. Those who are in daily contact who also for the most part have their heads up their backsides as far as knowing what is going on.
5. The girlfriend who went elsewhere because the guy wasn't there for her good times and who doesn't like how he changed after he returned.
6. The Vet who has bottled up his feelings and doesn't know where to turn... He turned to what was his life and found out he definately didn't belong any longer.

I think if the Vet was willing to watch with others letting them know how he really felt, and if they were open minded and understanding enough to listen, it would help overall in many respects. The one thing I hated and that finally became a sore spot for me was those well intentioned people who would say something like ""I know how you feel"" when unless they had experienced it really had no idea. Unless you experienced war up close and personal (and this goes back as far as you want to take it for WWI, WWII. Korea, Viet Nam, Iraq, Afganistan, or any POLICE ACTION), you haven't a clue into what is going on inside the person's head.",1238630400,4,1678,4.343949044585988
897467,5,6304542852,"A very well acted, heart wrenching movie. Kathy Bates delivers yet another brilliant performance in this film proving why she is one of Hollywood BEST actors. I thought her role as the mother was one of her best roles EVER! The story line was well thoughtout and believeable which is what I look for in a film. I won't go into the details of this movie (others have) but IF you want to watch a film where the acting is top rate and the story line so good that it seems real, check this movie out. It's a keeper.",1215907200,,511,4.171717171717172

He had served there and I knew that interested him.  He had seen this dvd at my house several years ago.  I bought him a copy this year since this Christmas he asked me the name of this dvd, etc. and said he would enjoy watching/buying it IF he knew the name of it.  Thanks so much for having the dvd for him.",1168819200,,451,4.044943820224719
897469,1,6304542852,"I am amazed at the great reviews this film has received.  I thought it was quite underwhelming.  As I see it, there were two problems.  The first is that the family portrayed in the film would drive anyone crazy.  Estevez didn't have to be a Vietnam veteran to have problems with the parents.  Even ""The Graduate"" (Dustin Hoffman's first lead role) would have been driven out.  I would have joined the army just to get away from them, war or no war.  This dilutes the impact of the plot.  It would have a more poignant film had the parents been understanding people without the idiosyncrasies of the parent characters.  It would have focused more on the actual problems of a returning veteran.  The film ""The Best Years of our Lives"" was far more powerful, even if it was about returning WWII vets.  ""Born on the 4th of July"" was a far better film too, even though it was an anti-Vietnam film with political motives.

The second problem is the main protagonist.  The character is a clich Vietnam veteran, not a real one, even though many real ones had problems.  He is more of a political device than a real veteran.  Jeremy resents his father for not giving him the money to go to Canada.  While in Vietnam, his commander orders him to shoot a prisoner, which is the source of his psychological problems.  There is little portrayal of the horrors of war. The event that caused the psychological problem is the only scene that explains it.  The plot is thin.  This is exacerbated by what I consider a poor performance by Estevez who, in my opinion, has problems playing serious dramatic roles.  His behavior isn't convincing.  Tom Cruise played his part in ""Born on the 4th of July"" far more poignantly.  Jeremy was a flat character with little substance.

Perhaps this is why used copies of the film are so cheap.  I think that I will pass on ""Bobby"".",1164585600,2,1852,4.5592705167173255
897470,5,6304542852,I just watched this movie on TV and all I can say is wow. The characters all play out like real family members. Kathy Bates is just brilliant in her role as the mother.

897471,5,6304542852,"This movie shows the way war veterans feel out of place once they return from war.

I believe this movie should have recieved a lot more recognition however. I just rented it by chance, but I heard nothing about it before hand.

897473,5,6304542852,"A griping story of a families turmoil brought about by a Son's experience of the war.  The writer delivers an unusual look at what can, and often does happen when the ""prodigal son"" returns from Vietnam. The actors,truly captured the essance of the turmoil and bring it to the screen with stark reality.  Martin Sheen as the Father, and Kathy Bates as the Mother excell in thier roles, and Emilio Estaves who also directs create an emotional crisis that wrench at the heart of the viewers. Thier powerful performance is only enhanced by the fact that they are Father and son in real life. Kathy Bates is ""annoying"" as the Mother who simply won't let her ""Son"" grow up upon his return...yet her performance is outstanding. The entire production brings the audience ""into"" thier home ... one becomes part of thier ""Family"" without realizing it.

The timely ""flash backs"" of the war's actions are well done and allows the audience to see just where the turmoil begins without disturbing the central storyline.  There may be many who do not understand this turmoil but for those that do, this small and underated production is a must for everyone's video library. To those who understand,the ""War"" within the household  is far more devastating than the War at the front. The conclusion is the true reality of the piece and allows one to share the heart wrenching sadness that comes with the inablity to  cope. The entire cast is a true credit to the acting profession... and Martin Sheen can be proud of his son's ability to continue in the profession he was born into.",1100304000,,1565,4.735294117647059

If your looking to explore how America dealt with the return of our soldiers from Vietnam and the expectations placed on them, then this is definitely a movie to watch. As the first generation of men raised to not only recognize their emotions but to express them, the returning soldiers were poorly understood and received little to no support for their emotional crisis. This movie attempts to explore the phenomena of combat PTSD before it even had a name. Excellent movie that doesn't shy away from exploration of a confused and turbulent subject.",1430956800,2,729,4.887096774193548
