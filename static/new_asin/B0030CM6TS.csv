8385740,3,B0030CM6TS,"This movie was alright, it was nice to see some of the insights of the anglers, especially, the other side of Mike Iaconelli, who is a loved and revered Classic Champion.  He has done so much for the sport, whether it be on the lake, bringing new fans to competitions or for his work with the wounded warriors program.  It's extremely interesting to learn about how Florida strained bass are now stocked in most lakes in warmer climates, especially, the Southeast where they are able to feed all year round due to the warmer climate.  It seems as if the North is the only place you can truly catch a classic monster that is of natural DNA and grows up in an environment where the fish actively gorge half the year as opposed to these monster bred fish from the south who grow so quickly and become big so fast.",1388793600,,810,4.386666666666667
