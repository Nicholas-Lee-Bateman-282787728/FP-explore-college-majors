Like make the subtitles ANY color EXCEPT white and instead a DARKER color and BIGGER size so it would be easier to read it during the movie. The current size is too small and the color of the subtitles is too light and fades easily with the constantly moving background of the movie. Either change the size and color, or give the audience the option to put a background on the suptitles so it doesn't blend in with the movie so much...",1516665600,,523,4.282828282828283
