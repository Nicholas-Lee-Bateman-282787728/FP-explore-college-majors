They didn't have cable and they always said really sounds interesting that they would look into it. . .well, I couldn't wait so I purchased it for her and her hubby. . .GUESS WHAT, they like the series so much they ended up getting DIRECT TV so they can see it up there in the mighty Rockies. . .So I'd say GREAT PURCHASE, changed some minds out there!",1371686400,,417,4.085365853658536
