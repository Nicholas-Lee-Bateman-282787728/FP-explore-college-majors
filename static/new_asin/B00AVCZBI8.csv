8558023,5,B00AVCZBI8,Awesome. I love this dvd and Richard Dolan is the coolest. I have other dvds with Richard speaking on them and I really enjoy what he has to say. This dvd is majorly informative and I am glad I own it.,1458777600,,201,3.926829268292683
8558024,5,B00AVCZBI8,If you are into this topic as much as I am you will find this very informative and interesting. Worth the watch!,1421193600,,112,4.136363636363637
8558025,1,B00AVCZBI8,This was not a comprehensive and very boring for this writer. It almost seemed that he was consumed with other business. BAD and not worth the movie,1400457600,,148,4.518518518518518
8558026,4,B00AVCZBI8,"It might be a little dry for some, but it is the equivalent of reading Dolan's book of the same name. Not the highest quality video, but the information is very high quality.",1388966400,,174,4.303030303030303
8558027,5,B00AVCZBI8,"I had read the book ""UFOs & The National Security State"" about 4 years ago. This documentary does a good job of hitting some of the high points in that book. Briefly, this is a serious attempt to document the government attempt to discredit and coverup the reality of flying saucers. This documentary is one of the best, given that we lack a ""smoking gun"" to absolutely prove the case, although another recent documentary, ""Out Of The Blue"", references a public French government report stating that UFO's are real. This is an important documentary for anyone interested in the UFO controversy.",1388880000,,594,4.891089108910891
8558028,4,B00AVCZBI8,"It is hard to deny the existence with this information.  Yes, I know this is a lecture with slides and can be boring.  I guess you have to make the choice of being entertained or getting information.  I take a star off for the fact that it is long and can be boring but the remaining 4 stars are for the critical information it provides.",1388188800,,337,4.153846153846154
8558029,1,B00AVCZBI8,I don't understand why Amazon charges money to view some guy giving a boring lecture with power point slides.  REALLY?  Absolutely awful!,1384646400,,137,5.181818181818182
8558030,4,B00AVCZBI8,"This is a standard definition video lecture. The speaker's conjectures are intelligent and well thought out. It's a good source, weather you're researching UFOs, or just looking for an interesting perspective on the subject. Some may not be impressed with the sound quality, but it's certainly audible.",1376784000,,302,5.446808510638298
