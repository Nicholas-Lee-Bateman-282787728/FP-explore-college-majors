It is not a documentary as much as it is a piece of art, intended not only to educate but also to evoke emotion and reflection.
The title of the documentary refers to the fact that life is short, intense, absurd, beautiful and this is expressed through small video snippets from the life of seemingly random people. We learn only a small fact about each of these seemingly random individuals, but it weaves into such a powerful story about history and mortality that it leaves me speechless every time I watch it.

There is no narrator, just images and text to provide background information to the video snippets being displayed. All this is set to music by Wim Mertens, which adds to the gripping emotion of the film.

This documentary will appeal most to people who know their history, as otherwise it might not make much sense and much of the meaning might be lost. I guess it can be described as an art house documentary although that label probably would have put me off from watching it in the first place. I only did so because it was recommended to me by a friend and I am so glad he did.",1260748800,,1185,4.431192660550459
