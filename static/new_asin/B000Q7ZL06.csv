8195010,3,B000Q7ZL06,"As with many films which I purchase, I did not get to view this for a long time. When I did sit down [finally] to watch the film, I slowly began to realize two things: 1] It had many places to go, and much to explain to the ""great unwashed' masses of the puritanical mind-set. And 2] the film did not arrive at the desired destination. Yes, there were interesting interludes, but the acting was amateurish, the direction left much to be desired, and the camera/sound work was not so good.  The idea behind this piece of cinema is good; it is relevant; and in the name of broadening one's knowledge and outlook, it could be an essential work to inform and educate. I would not look at it in terms of sexual exciting someone, male or female, or being a prurient movie. The film has a lot of potential, but it should go back to the body shop for a complete overhaul. I can give this a three-star rating, generously.",1488499200,,912,4.333333333333333

8195014,1,B000Q7ZL06,"Shame on writer/producer Katherine Linton for this mess of a film.

It was so bad that I will never see anything by her again.

The title of this lame attempt at film making should have been something more like: ""The Dark Underworld of Torture, Erotica, and the Porno Industry"" and should have come with a warning for graphic and violent images as well as had no mention of lesbians at all.

This film has nothing to do with being a lesbian or human lesbian sexuality at all. If someone who was curious about who we are and what we like sexually and what we really do with our partners, and how we feel in our hearts about our sexuality, this film would give a blatant false impression. This is a six episode film that starts out featuring 3 lesbian Go Go dancers and the shows they put on and the money they get in their garters. What it has to do with lesbian sexuality I don't know. This would mislead anyone into thinking we are all into strippers and have to watch sexually charged dancing to get off Wrong! It is fun to be young and see a strip show but is this how we identify our sexuality? Are we that shallow and warped? The only ""couples"" Katherine Linton features in this film are ""polyamorous"" which means they need more than one sex partner. She picked some real oddballs too all of which seemed very troubled psychologically and immature emotionally. Most lesbians are not polyamorous anyway and Katherine Linton says so herself in an interview on [...], where she clearly states they polyamory is more prevalent in the straight world. So why make it such a theme in a film about Lesbian Sexuality? The series gets worse, three of the episodes were about the porn industry except that the producers happen to identify as lesbian, which was not obvious with the huge fake boobs, fake eyelashes and way too long bleached blond hair. I really thought she was a drag queen. Some use men in their films to make it interesting and the sex scenes are mostly for straight men as the majority of porn is. There were some great shots of raw pussy and hard corp sex acts for the cameras but again, there are millions of lesbians out there leading lives with their partners, raising families, working at many professions who never squatted bare-ass on a camera lens for money, but we are sexual beings just the same and most of us are monogamous. Where Katherine Linton who identifies a lesbian got the idea that we are all oversexed and anything goes is anybody's guess. Again, misleading, if you want your family to understand you, don't give them this film to watch! The icing on the cake has to be the ""Cock and Ball torture"" Yes, you heard me right. Katherine Linton features a woman who says she is a lesbian but instead of featuring her and her partner and their lives a sexual partners it was all about her ""job"" which is...ready? Hooking up naked fat guys to a cock and ball torture machine. Yep, Katherine Linton wasted most of a half hour featuring someone demonstrating how to cock and ball torture a naked fat guy. WHAT? You heard me right.

Then there ""Red"" who likes to use knives and tie up her girlfriend and ""scare"" her. They like to cut each other up and draw blood and mock a BTK (bind, torture, kill, you know like the guy that was a serial killer and did this to dozens of beautiful young women who were daughters, mothers, sisters, before being caught, destroying the lives of the people who loved them.)Katherine Linton wants everyone to believe that all Lesbians like this kind of ""sex torture kill combo wam bam."" WRONG AGAIN! This was so disturbing that we had to turn it off. At this point I got really angry that this film was made and called Lesbian Sex and Sexuality! It certainly is not! Look, Good gay and lesbian films are very hard to find but every one I have ever seen was better than this. If you want to see how bad film making can be and how misleading a title can be then see it. otherwise, don't waste your time.

I have lived the decades this documentary is talking about and it is an accurate depiction of what is going on.  I am grateful for this documentary.",1234656000,,260,4.395833333333333
8195016,1,B000Q7ZL06,I bought this DVD because I read some of the other reviews. The people who wrote those reviews had to be really curious and had not even the smallest clue about lesbians because this dvd was not interesting. I only got through the 1st few chapters. I was so excited about gettin it that I kept tellinmy girlfriend about it then when we watched it we were super disappointed. I will continue to watch and hope to find something interesting that me and my girlfriend can learn. We are new to the lesbian world.,1203292800,5,508,4.414893617021277
8195017,1,B000Q7ZL06,"If I had previewed this movie I would have never purchased it. The filming was amateurish. I should have perhaps researched this movie more. I was thinking this DVD was a movie and had a story line. It is actually performed like a documentary. It basically jumped around here and there pointless never really offering any real meaning. It was a chore viewing this entire film. There was nothing sexy to me about this movie. However the design artistry of the DVD cover and the wording is captivating, but not worth the cost of this horrible movie. I would just give this movie away to a friend as a result, however I am sure they would refuse to accept it and perhaps drop me as their friend. Oh well, I'll just push this one way back in the deepest corner and underneath the shelf of my movie collection.

Don't waste your hard earned bucks on this one.",1200700800,10,854,4.439490445859873

Each episode touched upon a different facet of lesbian sexuality.  They were incredibly informative. Each episode featured many different experts and first hand sources. Overall they were great although they might be better for someone who already has some background knowledge of GLBT culture.",1190764800,9,465,5.092105263157895
