2018390,4,B0001NBNF2,"Ben Affleck plays a computer genius who has sold his soul. In exchange for a big pay day, he allows the company employing him to delete his memory after each job preventing him from selling his ideas elsewhere. Selling pieces of his life and his past has become routine; if Jennings (Affleck)is like the rest of us and really just the sum of his experience, his memories, then he has made himself nothing. He's no better or worse off than a robot.
He's tempted by one really big job. A billionaire (Aaron Eckart) offers him $92 million dollars for three years work and life that he'll never remember. Three years later, Jennings goes to cash in and discovers he traded in his paycheck for an envelope of trinkets. Suddenly, he's on the run and people are trying to kill him for what he can't remember. Jenning is forced to try and recreate his past using the contents of the envelope as clues. With the aid of Rachel (Uma Thurman)a woman he doesn't recall having an affair with, Jennings tries to discover what he did and it's important enough for murder.
John Woo's latest cinematic action piece has all the right elements for a Summer release; it's action packed and has just enough depth to the story to make it a worthwhile investment for audiences. Nicely shot with some great set pieces, Paycheck adheres to the core of Philip K. Dick's original short story pretty well. The screenplay embellishes it in such a way that it's perfect for an action science fiction film (much how Minority Report and Total Recall were altered to fit the mood of their respective directors). The screenplay, despite some plot holes, is pretty good at holding your attention.
Affleck and Thurman both turn in nicely detailed performances. While I didn't completely believe their relationship, perhaps part of that is because for Affleck's character it never really happened. Eckert gives an exceptional performance and actually could probably have played the role better than Affleck.
While Paycheck isn't flawless, it's got all the right elements for an entertaining, thought provoking popcorn movie. If it isn't quite as memorable as it ought to be, it's probably due to memory wipe.",1072483200,11,2170,4.8517520215633425
2018391,5,B0001NBNF2,"Ben Affleck is definitely at his best in this thrilling movie.  Almost from beginning to end, he is playing the role of ""escape artist"" and because there are future factors involved (I won't give away anything here)...he is a master at it!!  With all the twists and special effects of the movie that just keep going on and on, I was almost exhausted by the end of the film.

2018415,4,B0001NBNF2,"This is often considered the ""black sheep"" of director John Woo's American films, though to be honest I don't understand why. The story is engaging, the characters believable, and the ending more than satisfactory. Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, and Paul Giamatti all inhabit their characters perfectly, while Aaron Eckhart occasionally chews the scenery. If you like mysteries, this one's pretty in-depth...but its easy to follow if you pay attention. I think audiences were expecting more action, which is why it failed at the box-office.",1506902400,,535,5.380952380952381

Paycheck is a rip roaring ride at every turn. The characters engaging, with Affleck taking the leading man role in stride. Just enough arrogance-uncertainty-intellegence-guts to make this ""Indiana Jones type"" Average Joe turned Hero into a great time.

That is how well produced and written this movie was. This movie was actually ahead of the game when it came out. It can stand up to some of the best movies out there.

2018488,4,B0001NBNF2,"Paycheck is a fine and under-rated sci-fi film, with an great underscore. A problem is that at least two plot points appear only as deleted scenes making the plot, in the theatrical release, confusing in places. But it's still fine, and with a great cast at their best.
I must object to this Blu-Ray release, however: the film was made envisioning DVD as well as theatrical release, and issuing it now on Blu-Ray does it no favors: the sound is distorted and some of the dialog is inaudible over the SFX.

2018490,3,B0001NBNF2,"I like the work of Philip K. Dick. This film is an adaptation of one such short-story. So much potential yet . . .

Don't get me wrong, the film is an ""action-adventure"" thing and it fulfills the requirements thereof. People are chased, things explode, lives are lost . . . bang! pow! Ba-ZING-ga!

John Woo directed and got the bang-bang stuff right. There is a chase scene in a, I don't know, industrial cast-offs storage yard?, that is fun, though why there would be so many shipping containers lined up with both ends open is beyond me.

Alas, Ben Affleck stars and Uma Thurman follows him down, down, down into some really bad acting. There are a few places where the script is also terrible. When the bad script and the worse acting collide, well, it ain't pretty.

Still, if you want a bit of light-hearted action-adventure with a sci-fi kick you could do worse.",1461715200,,868,4.544871794871795

2018560,2,B0001NBNF2,"Hollywood is very much a movie-by-numbers place from which entertainment is churned out in the same way as Twinkies are churned out in the factory. Originality and good taste are eliminated early in the process in favor of standardized junk that has been proven to sell to people who really don't care about what they consume. Affleck, who takes the lead in this stock action thriller, does what is necessary to try to keep the audience's interest as one clich&eacute; after another rolls across the screen in predictable manner leading towards the overly-predictable finish. The problem is that the script, the direction, the camera-work and the special effects are all so stale that the biggest impression this movie makes is one of deja vu. It's almost a satire on dull action flics, except that it's not that clever so instead it's just an uninspired clich&eacute;d eminently dull wannabe movie that never rises above tedious. From the hilariously inept ""science"" of the ""time viewer"" and the inevitable reliance on justifying everything by using the name of the only scientist Americans have ever heard of, to the can't-quite-make-it-work ""stunts,"" through the flat dialog and the wooden acting there's nothing here that a drowning viewer could grasp for justification. One can only hope the various perpetrators of this movie abstracted enough cash into their private bank accounts to make the exercise worthwhile.

2018562,2,B0001NBNF2,"A lot of squandered potential for a good Sci Fi movie. The Sci Fi is downplayed leaving a weak remnant of an action movie! The time travel (future prediction) is the most believable part of this movie, and it starts out well, but quickly runs out of story line and degenerates into an excuse for endless car/bike chases and baddies who can't shoot strait to save their lives, and evil FBI agents who can't shoot strait or drive cars without crashing. Ben dodging bullets constantly, well you have to be 10 years old to still believe that people can repeatedly doge bullets from 5 feet, its not an intellectual way to do an action movie. If you are a teenager this movie may appeal, but its not Sci Fi and its not good action or story telling. Its available on Netflix, so I only wasted an evening not $15. Still it annoyed me enough to write a review.",1426377600,,851,4.3924050632911396

2018596,4,B0001NBNF2,"While you may not know the name Phillip K. Dick, many of the biggest Science Fiction films of the last thirty years have been adaptations of his work. Dick is responsible for the films Blade Runner, The Terminator, Total Recall, Minority Report, and Paycheck just to name a few. Due to the popularity of his work in film and how successful they've been, even a lesser known work like Paycheck has been made into a film. The story includes many of the action sequences and interesting characters associated with Dick's stories, but Paycheck does lack the futuristic Science Fiction that has become Dick's signature, which is the main reason this story isn't as well known as his other works. The story takes place in modern day, where a man is offered an irresistible deal. Jennings (Ben Affleck) is told that if he works on a secret project for the next 3 years, he will receive 100 million dollars. The only catch being that after the 3 years are up, Jennings memory will be erased and he will have no idea what he worked on. As expected, Jennings accepts the deal and returns to his life 3 years later, but nothing is that simple. Soon everyone from the FBI to bounty hunters show up trying to get to him, and the only clues he has come from an envelope he sent himself, containing 19 random items that seem to have little or no value. Ben Affleck stars and by this point we all know how I feel about him. Affleck is a terrific Director, who seems to have little interest in acting anymore. Paycheck however is a 2003 film, a time before Affleck had proven himself and he shows that rare charisma that is only present in his real early work. His performance is outstanding and aided further by his chemistry with co-star Uma Thurman. Thurman is another performer who I find isn't very good unless she's in very specific type of role, and fortunately for Affleck, this is one of those roles. Paycheck is missing the big signature associated with Dick's work and will be somewhat disappointing to his fans. I did miss the futuristic element, but I was intrigued by the mystery Jennings was trying to solve and the 19 items. Combined with the action sequences, (that are always top notch) Paycheck isn't what I expected, but was still very well done and definitely worth watching.",1413158400,,2279,4.601965601965602

They're each pointing pistols at each other....so, instead of Affleck maybe dodging to the side and firing off a few rounds , what does he do in the movie?  He ejects the magazine ( clip for you non gun experts ) from the pistol's handle and as it falls, he drop kicks it into the magnetized subway train rail....and then the bullets in the magazine explode and act as a kind of grenade to the bad guy as he's standing by the rail.  Yeahhhhh.....riiiiiight.....THAT would happen.  NOT!!!!  Then, a few seconds later, he breaks a pad lock by pistol whipping it........YEeeeahhhhh....riiiiighhhht.....that would happen ....NOT!!!  So...I had to quit watching after these ""defy physics/real world "" type scenes.  Granted, I know the whole movie is science fiction about seeing in the future which of course isn't real also...but when you start incorporating non believability into fights, gunfights and just the manipulation of real world objects in general......well, I'm sorry but I guess I.......and I suspect a whole lotta other people......are just too smart for this.",1395014400,2,1200,4.935323383084577
2018649,3,B0001NBNF2,"I enjoyed the concept of this movie. A familiar Philip K. Dick theme, a person whose memory has been expunged has to find out what his life is all about, is here given a twist in that the person leading him through the maze is himself. The acting is very good, although it is a little hard to accept the idea of Ben Affleck as a genius. Aaron Eckhart is a great villain, Uma Thurman a smoldering heroine and my only regret about Paul Giamatti is that we didn't see more of him.

I'd have given it an extra star if the director, John Woo, hadn't been so obsessed with the action sequences. The motorbike chase was good for the first couple of minutes, but soon got tedious; the fight sequences and explosions were likewise too frequent and too long. There are also rather too many situations in which suspension of disbelief is needed; sure, it's always necessary in Sci-Fi movies not to be too concerned with credibility, but here that need is stretched to the limit and a little beyond.

2018708,3,B0001NBNF2,"Paycheck is a science fiction action movie that takes place in the near future. The film is not too specific on exactly what year but we do know it's the future because of the technology that is presented throughout the film.

Ben Affleck plays the main character (Jennings) who is an engineer that does work for various companies and gets a huge paycheck. the catch is that every time he is finished with a project, he has his memory erased. Jennings takes on a job that takes 3 years that will give him a 90 million dollar pay check.  After he is done working, he goes to collect his salary but finds out that he had given the money back a week before. Jennings has no clue why he did this since he had his memory erased. He receives an envelope that has 20 different items that help him go through obstacles that he comes across after being framed of murdering someone.

The rest of the movie consists of Jennings finding out why he gave away the money and remembering that he had created this machine that lets people see what their future holds.

It is an intense science fiction movie with cool fight scenes that include shootouts and explosions. I would say that the movie is a cool guy movie since to watch when you are in the mood to watch something with violence . The plot was really cool and i enjoyed it alot but i felt that the way it was filmed could have been better and there were too many unneccesary slow motion scenes that ruined  some of the action parts of the movie. I also felt that the  characters other than Jennings, were a bit boring and needed some more time in the screen to have some growth. Another thing that bothered me was Aaron Eckhart's character and role as the main villain. It seemed like he was just there and that he could have been presented in a better way since he was the main villain and the reason that the story even happened.",1357171200,,1875,4.3428571428571425

  In the  past 50 - plus years i have seen several, including some very lame time travel  ideas.  My first was a 50's version of H. .G. WELLS  time machine, which today would be very low key indeed.

  With that in mind, this was well thought out, in modern terms, and probably based in part to what may have been ""Black ops""  over the last ...oh...since after WWII which we had no direct information to the general public, over 60 years of above top secret experiments.

  This also shows the capability of memory wipe, which has been a known  secret testing both in the military, and in CIA type operations over 60 years, and may still be going on.
  So all in all,  i liked the film.  There's more than what you openly see in the film, if you have the knowledge to see  what is there.  No...Not to be taken too literally!

I bring that up because Paycheck isn't a movie you can take seriously.  It's not animated, but it might be better if it were. It's essentially a live action cartoon. (The Bad Guy, for example, might as well be wearing a sign that says Bad Guy.)  Once you realize that, you can have fun watching it.  But don't expect more.

The plot doesn't have much to it.  The action scenes are fun  but in no way believable.  It's not a comedy but the acting is on the level of a sitcom.  Ben Affleck is a decent actor, or can be...he's been good in some movies... but is more or less monotone in this movie.  Uma Thermon is immensely talented but has little chance to show that in this film.

Matt Damon is said to have turned down the role Affleck went on to play in Paycheck; it's a shame if true, because he could have transformed Paycheck into a better movie (though even he might have had a hard time delivering some of the lines believably).

This story by Dick simply takes ""Chekhov's gun"" to the extreme. It is just proof of the principle that ordinary everyday items are what make up the events of our everyday life. Never under estimate the creative power of the ability to take the radically ordinary and create an extraordinary action movie.

Of course, there is a little ""cheese"" toward the end. As a story about seeing the future, it becomes a bit too predictable. The lotto numbers, the watch, all too easily identifiable. Nevertheless, it was a great movie rendition of Dick's narrative genius.

Dick's stories always render a major layer of interesting wisdom, which can be boiled down to a few aphoristic sentences to make a film like this a little less shallow, like: ""Some of the best things in life are total mistakes."" And, the question ""How does it end for us, Michael? I mean, what's in our future?"" can only bring the answer, ""You know, I don't know. And I kinda like it that way. I do know one thing, I never want to forget anything, ever again."" (End the romance with a final kiss!)

This is yet another hack attempt to take a pretty decent PKD idea and put it on the screen, and one of the biggest failures yet in final product.  Both Affleck and Thurmon were utterly out of place as actors. No wonder Affleck doesn't get any roles for anything any longer. Just horrible acting all around on everyone's part.

The only real similarity is that he uses clues to solve a puzzle that he left in lieu of getting a paycheck. Yeah...for a brief moment, there's a Rita Dunn and some of the other main characters from the short, but that's where it ends.  The locale is different, the job is different, Jennings's motives are all messed up.  I really was looking forward to a movie that could take Dick's work and bring it to life.  This thing just died as soon as the lights went down, so to say.  Add the horrid adaptation along with even worse, stiff acting, and you have a train wreck that is actually easily something you'd rather not watch.  I generally like Uma Thurmon, but in here she's exceedingly trampy and a turn-off entirely.  Even the hairdresser for this should not get hired anywhere else.  Yes...it's that bad.

Not only does one set try to follow Affleck's character through a small pipe -- in a car -- which they obviously can't fit through (and promptly spectacularly blowing up), but the Chief Bad Guy has poor deductive skills when it comes to predicting what Affleck's character is going to do.

Ben Affleck is at his Gigli-esque worst, displaying a grand total of two emotions as the genius-level intellectual willing to wipe the memory of his work after every assignment in exchange for a few extra dollar signs. Affleck doesn't deserve the full blame for this film's failings, though, as even Uma Thurman and Aaron Eckhart can't perform any miracles with a script so overcooked. Stiff, senseless dialog, uncomfortably dated pop culture references and an inherently flawed plot may have doomed it before the first role was cast. John Woo brings the goods during a few meaty action scenes, but even those suffer due to a loose interpretation of physics, a series of facepalm-worthy resolutions and a star who's simply not believable as the action hero he's playing. The high-concept introductory chapter works very well, but once this film sheds the skin of Dick's imagination and tries to take a few steps on its own, it stumbles in a series of bad directions.",1311897600,4,1146,4.822335025380711

I will tell you all now that I am a Ben Affleck fan and have always been, any one who stars in Kevin Smith movies is cool with me. Add in that I am a huge fan of Uma Thurman and you are giving me a movie I should like rather easily. Now I know the obvious jokes against this movie are they only did the film for the name of it [get it]. But there is actually something to this film and I do like it. It also helps that a man who knows how to shoot an action film was at the helm, John Woo.

The film follows Ben's character on his quest to find out who he is, that is of course after everything he knew has been erased by his former boss. The thing is he seems to have left himself some clues and tips along the way. Along with some items that e just may need including when he comes out of it. So now he is on the run from every one he knows [or at least thinks he knew] and only has one friend he can truly depend on. Add in a girl he may or may not have had a thing with and you have one crazy flick.

This is by no means a classic but it can be a fun film in all honesty, I know some hate it but I liked it. People tend to hate on this movie it seems because of Ben Affleck or something but to be honest I kinda liked him in this. To be honest this is his type of flick, a big budget with love story thrown in movie. I of course went into this mainly because of John Woo so I knew at least the action would be good. For the most part I was right as the film is entertaining and to be honest I kinda like the story.

Uma Thurman as always is fun to watch and I think unlike others she was a good match up with Ben, I don't know maybe the Tarantino and Kevin Smith fan in me. Still I don't want to give away much if you haven't seen this but for this type of flick it was pretty good. Be sure to put the brain away and just get ready for a John Woo action film with some Sci-Fi thrown in.

2018766,4,B0001NBNF2,"PAYCHECK is a science fiction story regarding inventions, patents, induced memory loss, and a machine for predicting the future.  Ben Affleck plays a reverse engineer.  His job is to copy inventions, and then have his memory of the project erased.  Mr. Affleck eventually gets a job to reverse engineer a machine that predicts the future.  During the time frame of this project, three years, Mr. Affleck develops a love interest with a scientist (Ph. D. in biology) played by Uma Thurman.

The story is one of continual intrigue, and it is not often certain who is being truthful to whom, and who is seeking to destroy whom.  But through all of this, Mr. Affleck and Ms. Thurman remain devoted and faithful to each other, though there is a period where Mr. Affleck's devotion to Ms. Thurman flags, somewhat, because his machine-induced memory loss has wiped out most of his memory of Ms. Thurman.

Shortly before the end of his project with the future-predicting machine, Mr. Affleck manages to send himself an envelope containing a bunch of mundane items, namely, a bus ticket, hair spray, a ring, a paper clip, and cigarettes.  At this point in time, Mr. Affleck also willfully forfeited his entire salary for the 3-year project.  This particular part of the plot, namely, the envelope and foreiting the salary, constitutes the central (and very clever) part of the plot of this film.

Please do not worry, I will not give away the ending.  But it should be noted that a similar plot can be found in Stephen King's story, I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.  And it should also be noted that a similar plot can be found in the TWILIGHT ZONE episode called, WHAT YOU NEED starring Ernest Truex.  WHAT YOU NEED concerns a street peddler, who provides simple items to people in a cafe, where these items prove essential to a hopeless man's quest for finding employment, or to another man's ability to prevent himself from being strangled to death, and eventually to the peddler's ability to save his own life.  These simple items include, a bus ticket, scissors, a leaky pen, and shoes.  It is therefore the case, that an essential part of PAYCHECK's plotline bears a striking resemblance to an episode of TWILIGHT ZONE.

And now for the bad news.  PAYCHECK is a bombastic film that features a great deal of superfluous computer graphics, fist-fights, and automobile chases.  During this movie, one can almost read the director's mind.  One can almost hear the director thinking to himself, ""Hmmm, the American public is too stupid to appreciate a clever plot on its own merits, and so what we need to do, is to have computer graphics, sparks, explosions, gunfights, fist-fights, automobile chases, collapsing buildings, more explosions, and even more explosions.""  Really, this is a very BOMBASTIC movie that shows disrespect to what would otherwise be a solid, intelligent plot.",1305590400,,2865,4.892339544513457
2018767,4,B0001NBNF2,"If nothing else, if this movie motivates you to look up its short story source by Philip K. Dicl<, then it's already done its part. But there's more to the film adaptation than that. PAYCHECK is a crackling good science-fiction thriller in which serendipity isn't a fortuitous accident as much as it is an engineered stroke of good fortune. In the near future world of Michael Jennings, time travel is impossible, yes, but what about ""time viewing""? Michael Jennings (Affleck) is a brilliant reverse engineer. He takes on assignments in which his clients hand over (perhaps a rival company's) new piece of technology, and he then works backwards to figure out its design, maybe even improve on the design. A disclosure agreement dictates that, once a project is done, Michael undergoes a procedure which erases all memory of his time spent working on the job. Michael, a rudderless guy, is cool with this arrangement.

Michael's latest secret project steals away three years of his life. Surfacing from his latest mind wipe he learns that he's forfeited his eight figure paycheck. Instead he's handed over a mysterious manila envelope containing twenty ordinary everyday objects. In the coming hours Michael Jennings will learn that these innocuous objects, one at a time and if employed properly, will transform him into an escape artist. The wild Hitchcockian man-on-the-run theme starts when Michael is taken in by the FBI on charges of treason. He may even be a suspect in the murder of a government physicist toiling in the weapons department.

For me the main hook is in seeing how Michael applies these random items - a book of matches, a paper clip, a crossword puzzle, etc. - to extract himself from one life-threatening scrape after the next. It's fun watching him piece the puzzle together, although, halfway thru the film, the audience is already in on all the cogent beats. But, c'mon, don't tell me there isn't an extra kick in that the figure guiding our guy thru the maze is none other than himself, or himself when he still had his memory and had gotten a peek into the future.

John Woo shallowly explores the theme of hope versus fatalism. Wrap your brain around this: The murdered physicist had been experimenting with laser-enhanced lens so powerful it could see around the curvature of the universe. The physicist had theorized that ""if you could see around a curve that went on forever, you would end up back where you started, looking at yourself,"" er, except you're not looking back at yourself now, you'll be looking at yourself in the future. Sounds like fancy gobbleby-goop to me. Suffice to say, there is now a device - which Michael had helped create - that can peek into the future.

The John Woo aesthetics are in full exhibit. The constantly moving cameras, the kinetic action ballet, the sheer style, the Mexican standoff with guns, that damn bird... The action sequences are dynamically staged (mostly), the stunts are amazing. I love watching John Woo at play. But PAYCHECK is also grounded by a strong love story, which is when Uma Thurman demonstrates her acting chops. Check out her performance in the scene in which her character, biologist Rachel Porter, realizes that the man she's been with for the past three years doesn't at all remember her. It cements her as someone with whom a rudderless gent like Michael would fall in love. Michael would never abandon Rachel. He'd think ahead. But the villains realize this as well.

I thought that Ben Affleck was fairly good. He's certainly got the action hero creds, and he doesn't embarass himself in the dramatic moments. The supporting cast is solid, featuring Paul Giamatti (not enough scenes), Joe Morton, Aaron Eckhart, and Colm Feore who's got one of those faces that just smacks of sinister.

PAYCHECK expands on the source, but isn't as good as. And I do admit that the big climax - consisting of an explosive but dull and dragged out action set - undermines the story. Sucks that Woo would pick the last leg of the film to not deliver on the action. And yet I liked the nod to Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST and the sci-fi thriller elements, the plot twists and that Twilight Zone vibe, and I'm thinking of two episodes: ""A Most Unusual Camera"" and ""What's in the Box."" It's too bad that them shifty characters in those two episodes weren't near as savvy as our working backwards, thinking ahead engineer. They probably can't stick fight, either.

2018771,3,B0001NBNF2,"In Paycheck (weird title), Michael Jennings (played by Ben Affleck) is an engineering genius who is hired by companies to develop new products.  The development process, for legal reasons (there is ""reverse engineering"" involved), is so secretive that Jennings typically consents to a ""memory-wipe"" after every job.  That way, he is assured of not sharing one company's secrets with another.

And then the classic, ""final, big job"" is offered.  It involves a three year commitment, and a three year memory wipe.  To Jennings, it will seem like no time passed.  And with a big paycheck, time for retirement!

Except... well, that is the point of this movie.  Things don't seem to be working out for Mr. Jennings, and when your memory has been wiped, you are REALLY confused when so many people are chasing you.

I liked the action in the movie, although the various shooters were even worse shots that typical.  Don't the various security agents ever practice with their firearms?  And that ""secret product"" was a real stretch.  I'll say this in a way that will only make sense to a person after viewing the movie; light from a laser, no matter how powerful, travels no faster than the speed of... light. It takes six minutes for light from the sun to reach the Earth.  Think about it.

And why did Jimmy's company seem centered around plants?

With no memory of the last several years, he tries to understand the items in his pocket (who, what and why???). Uma Thurman has a secondary role as his girlfriend.

There are slight hints of Minority Report and even Time Cop so the movie falls into the action/adventure/mystery/thriller type of category.
Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.
The plot, the setting, the dialogues, the music, and the special effects, are all good, however, there is a significant flaw in the plot in that Ben Affleck's character should have remembered Rachael (played by Uma Thurman) since he met her (at a party) well before being injected with the mind erasing device.
In short, Paycheck is a movie definitely worth watching if you are in the mood for a decent thriller as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.",1260576000,,889,4.894039735099338
2018797,4,B0001NBNF2,"The title for the review is not quite what I was ready to put down, but as I glanced at the web-page for the film I couldn't help thinking it was inferior to that of the lead review so I ""borrowed"" that from Joanna Daneman-the whiz reviewer. Of course, I could simply have said ""ditto"" to the rest of her review and let it go at that....or, better still, not written this at all. However, that is not the way of the world, one wants to stick ones oar in even when it is not in the least required.
Why some films in the same genre, sci-fi shoot 'em up action, leave me cool, sometimes quite cold, while this one was just plain fun and good watching most of the time is a mystery. Strangely enough, I was not really taken by any of the actors, though Affleck did his job well as did the other players who weren't stunt men and women. That crew, as well, of course, as the designer and director of the action scenes, are certainly to be commended. The plot was a tried and true one, the gimmick a good one, the ""end of the world"" scenerio as good as most are in this type of film....Oh, yes, Uma Thurman, got to smile a lot and look winsome when not taking her part in the action scenes (naturally, in between the stunt cast filling in as needed). The other actors did what was required. the non-human aspects of the stunts were entertaining and, on the whole, a good time was had by all (well, by me, anyway).",1254441600,,1407,4.176470588235294

2018799,5,B0001NBNF2,"I had seen reviews on this site that absolutely trashed this movie asking questions such as, ""How did he avoid hired killers?"" ""How did he dodge bullets?"" ""How did he know how to operate the machine?"" etc, etc... then I actually saw the movie. Keeping in mind people will have their own opinion of it, but I have to say for my money this movie was great.
I looked at the ratings and the ratings were so evenly spread out I couldn't believe it. I realize, after reading a number of reviews, a lot of people didn't completely understand the plot of the movie, but they trashed it anyway. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but there's a reason that everything looks so unbelievable. That's the beauty of this story line. There's no real explanation needed if you're paying attention to what going on.
Most of the reviewers that were wondering why these unbelievable things were happening missed the whole point. If they fully comprehended the story line they wouldn't asked the questions they did.
I know I'm being vague, but that's to make sure I don't give anything away. What I'm going to say was already in the trailer. No need to worry about me spoiling any scenes. If you dare to venture to watch the film be aware that Ben Afleck is a reverse engineer and he's the best in the business at what he does, so understand that it's his job to know exactly how the computers he's reverse engineering works. That by itself should eliminate most of the confusion (if any) about this movie. You just have to connect the dots. Don't step away for popcorn, pay attention to the story and you should be very much into this movie.
A lot twists and turns, action and great fun. If you don't enjoy this movie, don't kill the messenger... (eh... I'm mean reviewer).",1250553600,,1757,4.5109717868338555

2018801,3,B0001NBNF2,"In 2003, popular director John Woo would return with a sci-fi thriller adapted from a short story titled ""PAYCHECK"" written by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (known for popular novels such as ""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"", ""Minority Report"", ""Screamers"" and ""Next"", etc.) and a screenplay written by Dean Georgaris (""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2006) and ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"").

It would bring together well-known talents such as Ben Affleck (""Daredevil"", ""Sum of All Fears"", ""Pearl Harbor"", etc.), Uma Thurman (""Kill Bill"", ""The Avengers"", ""Pulp Fiction"", etc.), Aaron Eckhart (""The Dark Knight"", ""The Wicker Man""), Colm Feore (""24', ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", ""Changeling"", etc.) and Paul Giamatti (""Sideways"", ""Cinderella Man"", ""Shoot `Em Up"", etc.).

The film cost about $60 million to make and grossed over $96 million in the box office.  While Director John Woo received praise for his work on the film from several critics, unfortunately Ben Affleck was not so lucky as he received the worst reviews for his performance for the film, earning him the ""Worst Actor"" award for the Golden Raspberry Awards.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""PAYCHECK"" features a 1080p High Definition transfer.  There are times where picture quality is good but surprisingly, there are quite a bit of dust and scratches that show up throughout the film. Because the film utilizes a lot of blacks, you can often see the white speckles showing up and for a 2003 film, I didn't think I would see so much.

What works in the favor for ""PAYCHECK"" is John Woo's way of directing.  John Woo is one of the few men who edits as he shoots and has the film already preconceived in his mind and knows what shots he wants.  Joining him for the ride are talented cinematographers Jeffrey L. Kimball (""Star Trek: Nemesis"", ""Hostage"", ""Mission Impossible II"", etc.) and Steadicam operator Gregory Lundsgaard (""The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"", ""The Spirit"", ""Gridiron Gang"").

The shots that Woo chooses and the visuals are amazing and during the indoor scenes, you get quite a bit of darkness and the outdoor scenes, the transfer looks good.  But  again, not great.  The dust particles of course are not going to deter anyone's enjoyment of the film, but for those expecting the best transfer on Blu-ray, this is one film that needs some cleaning up.

As for audio, fortunately the audio was great.  The film is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD (and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital) and because of the many action scenes, you get great utilization of audio coming from all channels and even low frequency bass coming from the subwoofer.  I notice some scenes with a crowd, you will be able to hear the crowds through your rears.  Music taking advantage of bass but most of all chase scenes, crashes, explosions and bullet sounds directed through the various speaker channels quite nicely.  The audio was a major plus for this Blu-ray release.

As for subtitles, subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The ""PAYCHECK"" Blu-ray Disc release includes the following special features:

  * Commentary by Director John Woo - This film features on John Woo talking about the cast and the various shots and what he wanted to get.  Woo talks about the various revisions done on the film and more.
  * Commentary by Screenwriter Dean Georgaris - Similar to Woo, Georgaris talks about the storyline and the scenes incorporated from the short story to film.  Also, the revisions made to the screenplay.
  * Paycheck: Designing the Future - (18:14) Featuring interviews with Director John Woo, Producer Terence Chang, Production Designer William Sandell, Visual Effects Supervisor Gregory L. McMurry and the cast.  How John Woo took the role and his style of directing.  Both Affleck and Thurman are big fans of John Woo, so for them, it was a great experience to work with him.  Also, learning about the talents and how they prepared for the role and John Woo talks about why he enjoyed working with the cast.  From the making of the film to storyboards, set design and visual effects, this is covered in the featurette.
  * Tempting Fate: The Stunts of Paycheck - (16:48) Interview with Gregg Smrz (Stunt Coordinator) and John Woo about the stunts in the film.  From the motorcycle chase scene, to the building of the construction sites, how Ben Affleck wanted to do his own stunts, no CG used for the fight scenes.  Things were pre-planned.  Why they chose to go for no martial arts and more of a rugged, football/brawling fight moves and more.
  * Extended/Deleted Scenes - (12:37) Featuring seven deleted and extended scenes.  For example, Dr. Porter talking to her friend during the party about Jennings and trying to learn more about him.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""PAYCHECK"" is actually a film that had a lot of potential.  I really enjoyed the storyline of reverse engineering but also having the opportunity of seeing into the future and the ramifications if one had that technology.  Philip K. Dick's sci-fi stories from ""Total Recall"" and ""Blade Runner"" are sci-fi classics that you know that you are going to get a storyline that sci-fi geeks (like myself) can go nuts over.

Having John Woo as a director is like the icing on the cake.  His camera shots, the way the film is cut, the use of his trademark dove, if there was a director that could make this film a fun, entertaining action film, John Woo is a perfect choice.

With that being said, unfortunately, the screenplay by Dean Georgaris and Woo's main focus on the action took what could have been an intellectual thriller, to a film that features mostly all acting and no substance for the characters of Michael Jennings and Dr. Porter.  One is an engineer and one is a scientist, but they ended up being more superhero-like that somehow, due to the lack of any character development to make us really care for these two characters, the storyline and even the acting just falls a bit flat.

The film is entertaining but somehow, Ben Affleck doesn't come alive as an engineer and action star for this film, John Woo wanted Matt Damon originally (especially since he's shown what he brought to the Bourne trilogies).  Uma Thurman, great to see her doing more action since her ""Kill Bill"" films but her character was not exactly used efficiently.  Paul Giamatti was like the comic relief of the film and Aaron Eckhart did an OK job but again, his character was not used efficiently.

As for the Blu-ray release, I was a bit surprised by how much dust was evident throughout the film and that is something I really don't like to see for any film when transferred on Blu-ray.  The audio was well done but you want the picture quality to match the audio quality in HD goodness and unfortunately, it doesn't happen for this release.  Also, you are not getting anything new from the original DVD release, so if you own the DVD and wonder if it's worth double dipping, unfortunately I have to say no.

""PAYCHECK"" was indeed a film with a lot of potential but for Philip K. Dick stories, you want to have a smart, sci-fi thriller in combination with the action but most of all, good character development.  Unfortunately, the film did not meet that potential.

For those who want a straight-up action film, you will definitely be entertained by ""PAYCHECK"" but for those who want a storyline much deeper, unfortunately ""PAYCHECK"" suffers from lack of strong character development, not-so-effective acting and a compromised adaptation from short story to film.",1242691200,2,7562,4.885490196078432

But as it is, it's fun to see how they work the various items into Jennings' master plan in unpredictable ways. I've read the story by Philip K. Dick, and there are points of the story where it has been changed, and the machine works differently here, but the core concept is kept intact. And the question remains: Even if you could see the future, do you really think you'd be able to change it for the better?

Affleck doesn't really amaze anyone here, but he also doesn't detract from the story. Uma is fine and Eckhart is delightfully over-the-top towards the end. This is a man who has received a glimpse of the power he could have if he simply got rid of the obstacles, and he is determined to achieve that power. Even if one of the obstacles is his good friend Jennings.

There are some scientific improbabilities here along with some basic errors, but the driving force here is the philosophical concept, not the

2018822,3,B0001NBNF2,"Ben Affleck sure had a bad year in 2003, all of his worst movies came out that year. To name a few Gigli, Daredevil, and of course this one. Don't get me wrong this movie isn't horrible it's just that it tries so hard at being clever that in the end it fells quite silly. the movie begins with a reverse engineer named Michael Jennings (played by Ben Affleck) who gets paid hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars by big industries to take new existing technology and make it better, after he is finished with his work he is required by contract to submit himself to memory erasure, the memory they erase is only the work that he has done for his clients.

  Afterwards we are introduced to James Rethrick (played by Aaron Eckhart) who proposes Michael a deal of a lifetime, he must give up three years of his life in order to create something that doesn't exist, as a matter of fact he doesn't even know if it can be done: but in the end if he is successful he will be paid a substantial amount of money. anyway so far the premise of the movie is good.... so what went wrong... well after that three year gap we find Michael receiving the payment  for his work... but as soon as he checks his account all the money has being dropped and instead been exchanged for nick knacks. Anyhow i don't want to ruin more it's an okay movie to watch once. The main problem with this movie is the tone, there are things that just don't fit and makes you scratch your head and go ""HUH""? For instance Uma Thurman plays a botanist that somehow knows how to fight in hand-to-hand combat (must have learned in Kill Bill) also there are some plot holes that are kind of hard to ignore, as well there are random action scenes that look better for a matrix movie.

Also, as another reviewer pointed out, either the future can be changed or it can't, and the movie wants to have it both ways.  Even John Woo, whose direction I usually enjoy, wasn't in top form.

2018839,1,B0001NBNF2,"Like John Woo's other American films, ""Paycheck"" shows none of the innovation, excitement, storytelling or other qualities that made such movies as ""Hard Boiled"" so incredible.  ""Paycheck"" is a science fiction movie with no science, an action movie with very little action, a romance without any passion.  Even the McGuffin, which should be super cool, is just blah and unexciting.  The film makes no sense, includes plot holes aplenty, and doesn't have enough energy or fun to compensate.  Affleck, Thurman, Giametti - all of them are good actors that have made far better movies.  It's not their fault; lazy scripting and direction are the culprits here.

2018840,2,B0001NBNF2,"Paycheck is a disappointing and sometimes frustrating film because it clumsily toys with a number of potentially brilliant ideas without really knowing what to do with them. These key concepts come courtesy of Philip K. Dick, via his original short story, though the film poorly represents the themes and conceits that have made his stories into unforgettable classics.  As a thriller, Paycheck depends upon our identification with its imperiled hero, but the movie is never able to make us truly care about Ben Affleck's Michael Jennings or his fragile state of mind, and that's something Dick would have found unforgivable. Only Uma Thurman really earns her paycheck here. The premise is high concept, and the prophetic threat is revealed to be of apocalyptic proportion, but Paycheck is never more than a pedestrian action film spun from chains of meaningless chase sequences and flat fight scenes. The future world created by John Woo isn't nearly as engaging or convincing as, say, the captivating science fiction setting crafted by Stephen Spielberg for another high-profile Dick adaptation, Minority Report. For Paycheck, the comparison is not flattering. Sadly, Woo can't even keep himself from forcing his own creative preoccupations into the film, and a resulting motorcycle chase sequence is outright uninspired and may represent the film's low. Some scenes are enjoyable, and there are fleeting flashes of wit and excitement, but much of what unfolds seems inappropriately conceived or placed. Paycheck isn't a smart film and, what's more, it sometimes assumes that its audience isn't even paying attention. As a result, the film never comes close to living up to its potential. The material and the audience deserve better. Unfortunately, Paycheck is forgettable fare and, truly, it is without any real payoff.

Edit: I recently watched Aaron Eckhart in ""Suspect Zero"". In which I found his acting to be...competent...yet both had a quality that is indescribably compelling...I think somehow, this average ice-cream-bar-actor brings something very solid and powerful to the screen...although he may bore you to tears.

The first 20 minutes of the movie are admittedly punctuated by asinine stupidity, like science fiction written for kindergarten. In fact, there are incredibly stupid parts that marr the entire movie.

Somehow, the movie works very well together. The stupidity is honed by sleak, sexy science fiction and a well moving action line. I can;t explain it...watch the movie all the way through and see if you like it...I did...and I hate most movies.",1146787200,9,971,5.251612903225807

However, on a particularly well-paying gig, Jennings awakens from his memory erasure to discover that he's traded his obscenely high paycheck for an envelope full of random personal items. As the movie progresses, we learn that Jennings has risked everything to save himself, his girl (Uma Thurman), and (of course) THE WORLD. (Insert booming soundtrack music here.)

Although I found the premise of Paycheck highly original, and the action more than adequate to keep me interested, the scenes between Thurman and Affleck fell flat. (In addition, more than a few melodramatic moments had me rolling my eyes.)

I don't want to spoil the story line, so I won't go much into detail.  The plot has to do with a technology that enables one to see the future.  And a lot of the time the main character is trying to make sense out of the present, and what he has been ""given"".

I was at (am at) a point in my Christian walk of 30 years, that sometimes things don't make sense until I see them through the lense of 5 or 10 years.  Then I can understand that Jesus and the Father love me, and can see the future, and give me just what I need in the present, even if it doesn't seem to make sense.

The film has action, a la Hollywood.  I enjoy that.  If you are offended by that, this might not be for you.  There is also a hint of the protagonist and his partner being intimate.  It is a hint, and I wasn't offended.

2018865,3,B0001NBNF2,"One always has great hope for a film script with Philip Dick parentage, but this film was a disappointment.  John Woo is a talented director, but he is completely unsuited for this sort of film.  The dark paranoiac style in Philip Dick's writing has not been used to greatest advantage in film except in 'Blade Runner', which ironically did not cling closely to the story, however, 'Paycheck' pushes alienation from the spirit of the story to new heights.  Neither does 'Paycheck' show the humor or spirit, director Woo's films are famous for, leaving Paycheck's unnecessary and out of place chase scenes feeling like a death mask of a John Woo film.

From a performance perspective, Affleck and Thurman are ill matched romantically, with this casting choice made worse by director Woo's decision to play up the romantic aspects of the film.  The supporting actors, particularly Aaron Eckhart turn in a strong performance however.

Despite the poor directing, miserable and underdeveloped script, lack of strength as either an action, or science fiction film, and an unhappy ""near future"" look that looks only Hollywoodish and phony, Paycheck is not a genuinely awful film, and someone satisfied with a generic commercial movie might not be too severely disappointed.  I would not recommend purchasing this movie to anyone with a limited DVD purchase budget however.",1132963200,12,1366,5.153846153846154

You have PAYCHECK.

One wonders when Hollywood will realize that the market for this particular clone of movie is saturated and move on to something else.

Sure it's true that Ben Affleck usually has about all the charm and acting ability as a cardboard cutout of himself, but in Paycheck, he actually does occasionally show a bit more talent than usual.

Affleck aside, Paycheck is a stylish mystery that does manage to more than hold your interest. John Woo's direction gives the film its' near frenetic pace, while allowing the viewer enough time to process the new clues as they are uncovered. Uma Thurman is fantastic to look at even when she has dirt on her face, and clearly, this is what Woo was intending when he put her in the role of a gorgeous scientist who steal's Ben's character's heart. Sure lady scientists who happen to border supermodels in appearance is a bit unrealistic, but no more so than the gratuitous and unnecessary motorcycle chase, so characteristic of this genre of movie.

Those slight shortcomings aside, Paycheck delivers on its' promise to thouroughly engross the viewer by delivering a future scene much more feasible than other more weak kneed futuristic thrillers that only rely on special effects to catapult their stories along.

2018873,2,B0001NBNF2,"I do not like Ben Affleck. It's not personal, its just that I think he is a lousy actor who relies on his looks than any other substance that, unfortunately, he does not have.

Paycheck did not change my mind on Affleck. It did, however, change my mind on Uma Thurman who I thought was a decent actress. What is she doing in this movie anyways? Isn't she supposed to be killing Bill? Uma overacts in Paycheck and it is very obvious from her crying scenes and the scene where she is begging Ben Affleck to change his mind and run away with her near the end of the film. Even Paul Giammatti, who is a funny actor, is not funny in this movie.

The story, however, is a rip-off of almost every single movie that was made in the same genre as this (action/adventure/sci-fi). You sense the clear resemblance of Terminator 2 in the whole idea of looking into the future and this big war erupting! Armageddon, in which Affleck also starred, is ripped off at the end of the movie where Affleck will risk his life to destroy the machine and have Thurman run for her life. Minority Report is also ripped off for the obvious reasons (the whole look into the future) In a nutshell, the story's been told a million times before.

In the midst of this viewing chaos, one must admit that Paycheck succeeds in gluing the eyes to the screen. It is mildly entertaining especially the very last scene which is quite funny and surprising (I will not give it away!)
But the overacting, Ben Affleck, the repeated story and plot (and even images) makes this Paycheck not worth cashing.

2018874,4,B0001NBNF2,"It's funny how great ideas can come from the most unexpected places. John Woo is known for his high-energy action films and not for innovative science fiction. Paycheck delivers on the latter, but in a smaller dose. It's more an action/suspense movie anyway, but if you focus on what the movie is you will end up pleasantly surprised by what it turns into later on.

The plot is an interesting twist on the whole man-on-the-run type theme we have seen in movies like Minority Report. And like Minority Report it delves into seeing into the future. Thankfully the similarities stop at the future seeing and hero chasing elements. While the theme is rather simple and even derivative the details around it make for an interesting show. Having our hero not know what he did for the past three years and only having a pocket full of items he left himself is a nice touch, even if the previews made it sound better than that. While the execution of the script is all well and good you don't get to the really good stuff until further into the film when Ben Afleck finds out why he is in trouble to begin with. Not only does this become a fascinating plot twist it makes the entire movie come together as an innovative story.

This being a John Woo movie I am sure many of you are expecting lots and lots of action. Well it's not a full throttle John Woo movie in the action department. Don't get me wrong. There is a really exciting motorcycle chase scene and near the end you get a sweet fight sequence. There just isn't as much action in Paycheck as there are in Woo's other films. That's actually a good thing since you get more background into the story itself that wouldn't be there.

There is one thing that sticks to my craw about this movie and that's Ben Afleck. Don't get me wrong. I think he did do this role well... technically. It's just I didn't feel drawn into the character at all. I wasn't convinced I was seeing Mike Jennings struggling through his predicament, just Ben Afleck. Uma and the rest did a fine job though. Sorry Ben. Technically speaking the movie is tight and you get some dynamic camera angles as well as some other neat cinematography tricks. It all makes the movie quite stylish, which seems to be another of john Woo's trademarks.

Paycheck has elements in it that make it a truly fascinating movie, but you have to wait for it. For those of you who enjoy a good time paradox story I believe the wait is worth it. If you can get past that (as well as Ben Afleck's average performance) then you should be able to get the most out of Paycheck.",1118880000,7,2572,4.431289640591967

He takes on a 3 year project for an old friend thinking of the massive payday when its over. When the project is over he discovers he has signed away his rights to the money and left himself an envelope of seemingly useless objects instead. He uses the objects to piece togeher the mystery of just what he did for the last 3 years. The movie is at its best in the first half as you try along with Affleck to figure out what's going on. The second half humps up the action and the number of bullets that never find their target. Uma Thurman plays the love interest but isn't given all that much to do, nor is Paul Giamatti as a trusted friend. As for Affleck, I'm bored with this ""let's all hate Ben Affleck"" cult that has grown in the last few years. Will he win an Oscar? No, but his performance here was fine.

2018886,3,B0001NBNF2,"By now you probably know the plot of this thriller -- something about an engineer trapped in a mind warp and a lens that can tell the future. This was the promising beginning of John Woo's action film with popular actor Ben Affleck.

It worked for about 45 minutes and seemed to peak at a certain point...until Affleck suddenly put 2 and 78 together and figured out what was going on. That came from nowhere. Then interest began to build again as the character started putting the pieces of his past together.

Until the chase and fight scenes became so fantastic as to be inane, that is. Ever wonder how an actor can avoid 75 bullets shot straight at him from bad guys, who always stand perfectly still with automatic weapons, waiting for the hero to come up and kick them, knocking their weapons asunder and escaping to small spaces when none are available?

If you answered yes, you'll love this movie. It has a good plot for about 40 minutes and good action for a little longer, but it falls apart from ridiculous action sequences and a plot that is simply too fantastic to believe.

I enjoyed this for most of the first hour as escapist cinema but it became too much for me to accept soon thereafter.

2018887,4,B0001NBNF2,"An interesting and thought provoking movie. I love action, karate and shoot-blow-em-up movies so this fits me just right.

What i find worthwhile thinking about is the line of reasoning that results from building the machine.

1- we can see the future

2- therefore the future is not open but determined

3- therefore we have no hope

4- the best we can do is move along a little faster this dytopic world.

reminds me of the movie -Krull?- where the cyclops was tricked into sacrificing one of his eyes to see the future, but all the race saw was the time of their own death. the same nihilism and and resignation was the result.

As an orthodox Reformed Christian i often argue for the strong deterministic side of the equation. God does know and foreordain all that passes. The trick is that He isn't telling us, except about the very end- He wins. This has always been a hopeful argument, God is in control, God is Love, therefore everything is right with the world despite immediate appearances.

This movies take on open future and hope has me thinking about the various ways people have answered these questions. For example, the main character sees and modifies the future, he is hopeful and strives to overcome and change what he sees. Ignore the problems with this, for example, each item in the envelope requires a new future once it enters into the envelope etc. Just look at his reaction, prompted by the love he found while working on the time vision machine, a reaction of hope that motivates to action. He saw the future- two things, the destruction of the world and his own death. There was an element of resignation towards getting on the catwalk and dying throughout the movie, mostly in order to heighten our surprise at the watch going off. But nothing but hope and energy to save the world by destroying the world. Why would he be hopeful if the world was not?

So it is still a weak determinism, he does multiple times change the future, it is probablistic not determined. His hope stills comes from the cracks, from the minor probability that he will alter events. Why would the world react differently? because of the herd effect, stupidity, the movie seems to hint at evil (get a jump on the war).

It was fun to find out that Jennings got a glimpse of his future and knowing that his memory would be erased, he left himself a group of personal clues - he just had to figure them out.

I liked the chase scenes whether on foot or car [motorcycle] - the characters [all of them] were excellent and believable.

2018919,4,B0001NBNF2,"It seems this film's reputation may be suffering from incorrect genre identification. This is an ACTION drama with a futuristic twist. John Woo says the original story was SciFi, but he took ""80% of that out"" so he could make a more believable movie. (Perhaps it would've received kinder reviews if he'd left more in.) The characters ARE developed well enough to create interest & empathy. Perhaps not successful as SciFi, ""Paycheck"" is a decent action flick.

The actors all do an excellent job of staying real & interesting, but nobody goes over the top. Woo intentionally spreads the focus among the ensemble rather than making another Star-Driven vehicle. Oh, there are stars, and the villains do get edgy for sure; but there are no scene-stealing overacted performances. That's just fine - some of us just do not need to be visually assaulted by acting style in order to enjoy a performance. Ben Affleck continues in his understated 'regular guy' mode. Uma Thurman, fresh from her 'Kill Bill' gig, looks smart & tough, and that's exactly how she acts. If anybody in this cast does a very polished job with the action itself, it's her - BUT it's very believable & in character. She just may have become THE leading lady for sincere & skilled action. The supporting cast is excellent, the action is generally slugfest 'NFL' style instead of 'martial arts masters', and the principals do most of their own stunts.

The premise is handled in a believable way (much better than the typical time-travel stories which unravel) with well done tech-FX. Chases, explosions & other stunts abound, but don't overpower the story. The action is REAL live action, mercifully not blue-screen CGI overdone to death. (OK, there are 1 too many ""mexican standoffs."")

The characters actually develop & portray relationships that don't require a lot of screaming, cursing & nudity to convey. Wow. Some of us LIKE that. John Woo did it that way on purpose, with homage/respect (= PROPS) to great films & directors who created memorable classics that way. It even bears repeated viewings. Hmm, wish there was a genre for THAT.",1098403200,8,2108,4.915730337078652
2018920,1,B0001NBNF2,"I don't know if it's an ironic conceit of John Woo that a movie about predicting the future can have viewers predict what will happen next, and it's based on a short story by sci-fi's most unpredictable writer Philip K. Dick.  There are some mildly intereseting moments such as the Memento-like plot device that involve random objects to aid his memory,  but most of the time, it's strictly by the numbers. Compared to other Dick-based movies like Minority Report, Total Recall, and  Blade Runner, among others, where grit and atmosphere are overflowing, Paycheck is bland, bland, bland. From the sets (it's supposed to be 2007 but it looks like Any City circa 2000), to the actors (Ben Affleck and an I-Don't-Know-What-I'm-Doing-Here, Please-Watch-Kill-Bill-Instead Uma Thurman) to the visuals (where was John Woo's flair we last saw in Face/Off? We only saw the trademark dove) and the gaping plot holes (if they were willing to kill him after the memory wipe, why did they not kill him beforehand after Ben Affleck finished the project?), you wouldn't want to spend your hard-earned paycheck buying this movie.",1098057600,3,1113,5.0710382513661205

When it was first released, It didn't sound all that great, so I ignored it. Then by chance I came across a DVD of this movie and decided to watch it. What a surprise! This is now one of my favorite sci-fi movies.  Had I known that it was based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick, I might have paid more attention to begin with. Especially since he was the author of Minority report and Blade Runner (under the written title of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"").  One of the most outstanding things about this film is that there is no bloody gore, no sex, and not a lot of strong language. It is very fast paced, filled with action and suspense, great acting, and includes some of todays finest actors. I thought it one of Uma Thurman's best performances, and Ben Afflick  was at his best. I would highly recommend this DVD (which also has some great bonus materials) to anyone who is a Sci-fi fan and loves action movies, because it is both.

2018922,2,B0001NBNF2,"Don't get me wrong, I'm no stickler for so-called faithful adaptations.  For example, ""I, Robot"" is a wonderful movie though it bears little resemblance to its source, just as ""Apocalypse Now"" remains the only decent rendering of Conrad's classic novella ""Heart of Darkness"".  Adaptation is about transposing a story from one register to another, and that obviously involves making creative choices.  The problem with ""Paycheck"" is that the choices made were all bad ones.  Subtlety and sophistication were Philip K. Dick's stock in trade, but they're clearly alien concepts to John Woo. I'm all for the occasional action film that lets you check your brain at the door - and he's made plenty of those - but ""Paycheck"" should never have been one of them. It looks great and sounds great, of course, as everything from Dreamworks does. Pity about the stupid plotting (why, exactly, do Michael and Rachel need to REACTIVATE the oracle when they've come back with the express purpose of destroying it?!), the dumbed down dialogue, relentless explosions and tired Hong Kong gun-play, and, worst of all, the offensive spectacle of Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman struggling under the dual impediment of zero chemistry and ludicrously bland characterization. It all plays like a Manga animation done with digitized humans, right down to the nauseatingly romantic, soft focus, floral epilogue. Spielberg showed us precisely how to do this kind of movie in ""Minority Report"": you can have all the high-octane fun you want, but give us a hero we care about and a plot that makes us want to keep watching. Watch ""Paycheck"" back to back with that - or with that other Dick-based masterpiece, ""Blade Runner"" - and you'll see precisely what I mean.",1097884800,2,1731,5.020905923344948

Uma was great, but underused.  The cast was good, but the cops were also underused in their roles.  Ben Affleck as one of the most intelligent scientists of our time - a reverse engineer?  Please.  Totally ridiculous casting, either that or badly played by the actor.  Now that I think of it, what has Affleck done that I actually liked?  Maybe only Bounce and Sum of All Fears.

I liked Blade Runner, Face/Off,Minority Report, and Total Recall (in that order).  I liked Paycheck too, but there were way too many pieces of the storyline that came ""unglued"".

2018935,4,B0001NBNF2,"This is really a pretty fun movie that did remind me quite often of Minority Report (Before I discovered both were written by the same writer).  The one big problem I had was with the premis.  This mega computer & software company (In the Seattle area...I wonder what company the writer might have been thinking about?) had initially set up Michael (Affleck) to die while the FBI tried to extract information from his erased memory.  Then when that went sour the software companies staff of team killers (Just like Gates crew I bet) tried to kill him anywhere they found him regardless how many people to witness were around.  I couldn't help but wonder why they didn't just snuff him out when they sat him down for his injection to erase his memory of the past three years.  He had no idea what they actually were injecting into him.  A good dose of poison, and then they'd just have to make his body disappear for good.  Instead they try to be cute and end up playing the wild west all over town and risk exposing themselves while trying to kill him.....Other than that it is really a pretty good movie...As long as you don't expect too much logic in the story.....",1096070400,2,1167,4.502369668246446
2018936,3,B0001NBNF2,"I avoided paying to see this movie when it came out because (other than ""Good Will Hunting"") I'm no fan of Ben Affleck & I formed the impression from the media that the movie was a train-wreck. But along came Hurricane Ivan & I was confined to barracks in Cuba & bored out of my mind & about ready to get physical with one of my more inconsiderate roommates & someone had the DVD, so I borrowed it & was pleasantly surprised.

This is not an outstanding movie, but it's entertaining & Affleck is better than I expected, though far from brilliant. Bottom line: The jury is still out. ""Good Will Hunting"" is one of my favorite movies, but I suspect that is owing to Matt Damon & Robin Williams more than Affleck. I suspect Affleck's supporting role in ""Hunting"" is about as good as he gets. But I'm not certain--perhaps he will get some role at some point that will see him shine. I haven't seen it yet. In fact, I don't understand why he's still getting major roles. He is, however, OK in this movie. Not bad at all.

This movie is nowhere near ""Blade Runner"" & it's not as good as either ""Total Recall"" or ""Minority Report."" The opening title sequence in particular is derivative of ""Minority Report."" Where Tom Cruise manipulated fragments of the images generated by the three visionaries, Ben Affleck manipulates engineering diagrams in a very similar way.

This is also not as good as ""Face/Off."" So it lives up to neither the standards set by the previous movies based on the writer's work nor the standards set by the director.

However, an entertaining movie for a rainy day.",1094860800,,1581,4.536842105263158
2018937,3,B0001NBNF2,"He is however, a pretty good movie star in an entertaining movie. I love the premise. Affleck plays an engineer that takes on top secret projects for money. Afterwards, he undergoes a procedure that destroys his memory of the project so he doesn't remember a thing. For the good looking, affluent player that he is is these gaps in his memory can be a problem, (like how did the Red Sox do in the playoffs?)
  He contracts for a top secret job that will pay him 90 million dollars. The catch? The project will take several years. He memory will be erased for all that time. When he comes back freshly scrubbed, he discovers  he has somhow forfeited all his money. Why? He doesn't know. He has fallen deeply in love with Uma Thurman. He doesn't know her. However he did leave behind a large envelope with clues from which he must figued out what happened. They are seemingly unrelated everyday objects: a diamond ring, a book of matches, a crossword puzzle, a crystal etc.
  He slowly starts piecing things together & getting reaquainted with Uma. There are no sex scenes, but you get the general idea that they are getting know each other all over again. He is being pursued by his former employer & the FBI.
  The climatic scene is the same, disappointing, cliche ending that you've seen a thousand times. A big, overly long, elaborate, chase, then suddenly large explosions, everything blowing up, the villian usually being killed (unless there is to be a sequel) & the hero & heroine emerging virtually unscratched. That scene lost it a star. The end is fine. In the dvd version they have an alternate ending so take your pick.",1093564800,,1630,4.619377162629758
2018938,3,B0001NBNF2,"There've been a fairly high amount of spy/espionage action flicks in the past few years, but this one is actually a bit better than the typical film. I don't really like Affleck too much. This is the first movie of his that I really liked. There are two things that this movie excluded that most other spy movies don't: stupid superlatives and overused cliches and supercool protagonists who get all the ladies. Thank God. I get tired of James Bond's little player persona. The Bourne movies are pretty good, but Paycheck offers a pretty nice combination of action and substance, for an intelligent thriller. Spy Game had too much dialogue and not enough action.

Anyway, Uma Thurman is sexy and she had an incredibly good performance. At first, she appears to be a bit manipulative toward Affleck and you find out that she is actually a genuine, loving character. People are after Affleck because he has access to something worth over $90 million, which makes all the action plausible, as opposed to Collateral, which only had $600-700 on the line. You get to see glimpses of Uma's fighting skills that she uses more often in the Kill Bill movies. There was a movie from 1995, also from Paramount, called Virtuosity, that was somewhat similar to this, but not as good in general. John Woo has delivered again. He is quietly becoming one of the best directors in cinema today. I'm not sure why so many people didn't like this - it was intelligent, but not so much as to confuse the average viewer. Uma Thurman is the life of this movie. She should have won something.",1092787200,2,1567,4.677536231884058
2018939,3,B0001NBNF2,"What has happened to John Woo? First I had to sit through 'Windtalkers', and now this? 'Paycheck' isn't a bad movie. It's just not up to the par of the usual John Woo flick. It just seems like Woo is going through the motions.

John Woo made a name for himself in America with movies like 'Broken Arrow', 'Face/Off' & 'Mission Impossible: 2'. Those were very good action movies. They all follow the same guidelines really. John Woo has a tendency to repeat many of his ""trademarks"" in his flicks. There is the hero (Ben Affleck), the hot girl (Uma Thurman, looking a little rough here), the bad guy (Aaron Eckhart), the cool henchman (Colm Feore), the doves, the guns, the inevitable motorcycle chase scene, etc., etc.

The difference between those movies and 'Paycheck' is that the story was better, the acting was better, and we hadn't seen all of this many times before. This movie tries it's hardest NOT to be a Sci-Fi flick. John Woo doesn't exactly like those kinds of movies, so he turned this into a action, romance, and drama picture.

The story is average. It never seemed to pull me in as much as I wanted it to. I kept waiting for something else to happen to really grab me, but it never did. It is an interesting script and it has it's moments, but it was just missing something.

And when will people realize that Ben Affleck is NOT a great actor? Some of it may be his own fault for picking the crappy movies that he does, but he just seems miscast in many of his movies. He is NOT a good action hero. He gets through this movie, I guess. But, he is no Tom Cruise.

Uma Thurman is pretty much wasted here. I could think of hundreds of other actresses that they could have got for this and much cheaper. She does get to kick a little butt in the end, but she is just coasting through this role. I don't think it's really her fault, as she doesn't have much to work with.

Aaron Eckhart plays the cookie-cutter bad guy. While he does an admirable job of looking somewhat evil and being a prick most of the movie, he never really takes it to that next level. I have always liked the villians in John Woo's movies, and I was excited to hear Eckhart was playing this role. He just downplays the part, which can be a good thing. I just wished there was more energy from him.

The two best characters in the movie were supporting. Paul Giamatti's funny, cowardly character brings some fun to the movie. Colm Feore's henchman role is very well done. He really seems like he is having fun playing a ruthless badguy and he does it well.

Other than all of that, there isn't much more to say about this movie. It's your run of the mill action flick, basically. I was just frustrated with it because it could have been so much better. The story was interesting. The acting was average. It had a good look to it and the action scenes were decent. I just expect more out of John Woo. Let's hope his next movie doesn't leave us with the feeling that he and his actors are just in it for a ""paycheck"".

Special Features: There are seperate commmentaries by John Woo & the screenwriter, Dean Georgaris. There are two decent featurettes, 7 deleted and extended scenes, and that's about it. I feel that is kind thin for a ""collector's edition"", but it's not bad. I would give this disc an average rating in terms of the supplements.",1092787200,,3328,4.3808752025931925

For one, this is a good old-fashioned suspense/action (science fiction!) movie, with no cartoonesque quality, no larger-than-life stuff, and only a teeny-weeny bit of camp. Philip K. Dick is THE man for science fiction in our lifetimes, and even if they messed with the story, it still is better than 95% of the crap out there.

It is well acted, coherent, and perhaps best of all for me, a real example of a science fiction film, as we like it, and not some over exaggerated bit of nothing. This is straight-ahead science fiction. Despite its flaws, I only wish I could find one movie of this quality a month. I liked it.

2018942,3,B0001NBNF2,"John Woo's science fictionish ""Paycheck"" may be a bit much at times, (it really strains one's credibility), but it certainly holds your attention. There are echoes of ""Minority Report,"" ""Total Recall"" and ""Memento"" in this action-packed mystery thriller, which entertains but doesn't quite make-it to the quality level of the aforementioned films. The movie actually feels like a compilation of former, better flicks. ""Paycheck"" is based on Philip K. Dick's short story. Unfortunately, Director Woo's version bears little resemblance to that story.

 Ben Affleck plays Michael Jenn, a computer genius and ""reverse engineer,"" who steals technology and applies it for other companies. He deconstructs high-tech equipment to see how it is put together and what makes it work. Then he reassembles the same equipment, which he makes even more high tech, for any company willing to pay his price. His paychecks are very high but there is a BIG catch. He must agree to have his memory deleted so that he cannot implicate himself or anyone involved in the techno theft. A Non Disclosure Agreement taken to extremes, if you will. Only the memory regarding the job is effected, however. But the memory removal process can get a little dicey. The machine which does the erasing from the brain cannot be allowed to overheat, or the person attached to the brain will become a vegetable.

 A friend and colleague offers Michael the job of a lifetime with Allcom Inc. It will last for three years - he will have to give up the memory of three years of his life. However the paycheck will be 90 million dollars - enough so that Michael will never have to take another job. He accepts. Three years pass in a heartbeat. Memory is removed and Michael wakes up to discover he has signed-away his 90 million dollar paycheck. He forfeited the money, seemingly voluntarily. He has no recollection why he would do such a thing. Has he been tricked into working for free? He is also given an envelope containing the belongings he had on him when he began the assignment. Michael had been asked to surrender them before beginning the job. But the 19 seemingly unrelated trinkets are not his. There are a pack of cigarettes, hairspray, matches, ball bearings, etc. - all seemingly worthless. He has never even seen them before. He soon learns the envelope's contents are worth a fortune. They are clues, but he can't remember how to use them to get what he wants.

Most of the film revolves around figuring out what each item is to be used for. There is lots of action here. Michael does much running, escaping, chasing and hiding, along with his love interest, Rachel, (Uma Thurman), a somewhat ditzy biologist. There is almost too much action at times. Much of it is gratuitous and really distracts from the story. Or perhaps all the action is filler to make-up for lack of content. It's a shame, as this could have been a really intriguing mystery. There is no character development - not that kind of film. ""Paycheck"" is fun and cool, but ultimately does not deliver. It lacks the depth I prefer in a sci-fi film.

3) What was most enjoyable is the story concept. The ""What if..."" possibilities are well worth entertaining. This alone I found made the movie worth watching.

There are similarities sure but no aliens, no people laying in water tanks that can see the future, no false accusations of future murders, and no secret agents hiding their identity.

 In short Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings, an engineer that backward engineers just about anything, then has his memory erased to avoid litigation for borrowing other peoples intellectual property or copyrights, and then take them to the next level in development. It is as though he never worked at the company or created what he creates. A bit contrived? Perhaps but that is for the lawyers to quarrel over.

Good support from Thurman and Giamatti. I think the movie is entertaining. Plenty of John Woo style action, and a hero fighting the odds. Some real imagination went into this and I did not feel like I was watching some other movie. I had fun trying to work out the items Jennings left himself instead of taking the paycheck for his last job. I have seen all the movies the critics mentioned, and I just don't agree with them.

Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) is specialized in reverse engineering and his job consists in working non-stop for several weeks in each project he faces. Upon completion, he gets his money and his memory of that time interval is erased. The longest Michael has worked on a project is two months, but now his boss entices him to work on a three-year project. The bait is an eight-figure remuneration. Of course Michael has doubts, but the offer is too tempting for him to pass. By the time he finishes the project, he gets his one big paycheck in exchange for three years of his life: close to one hundred million dollars.
Michael gets a huge surprise though, when he finds out from his attorney that he has forfeited the portfolio and that the only possessions to recover are a set of items in an envelope at the attorney's office. Michael sent these items to himself, and they all look worthless; the list includes a can of hair spray, a pair of glasses, a book of matches, a bullet, a lighter, a watch and several other little an seemingly unimportant personal effects. When the FBI comes after him, Michael realizes that there is something wrong and that the items he sent to himself are meant to help him solve the mystery and keep him alive.
Even though I am not a big fan of Ben Affleck, I think he does a good job in this movie and that he fits his role very well. I am a fan of Uma Thurman though, who in the film plays the part of Dr. Porter, a lady that captivated Michael since he met her and who also works for Michael's boss. As usual, Thurman's performance is convincing and shows the passion she puts in her work. This is a good movie for spending a couple of hours entertained, but it is not one I would enjoy seeing repeatedly.",1089676800,3,2194,4.585241730279898

This movie gave me back the belief that Ben is still a pretty good actor. One anoyying thing in the movie is ""that haircut"" Uma Thurman ""wears"". It really looks bad and when she's not on screen it's a reflief. They could have casted a better actress to play her part, she did not come off convincing enougth.

2018965,2,B0001NBNF2,"**1/2 Though futuristic in look and tone, John Woo's ""Paycheck"" is really a throwback to that oldie about the man who wakes up one day as an amnesiac only to find himself being pursued by the authorities for a crime he may or may not have committed (just about every other Hitchcock film seemed to be built on this premise to one extent or another).  The difference is that Michael Jennings is an amnesiac by choice, a brilliant engineer and scientist whose job it is to develop top-secret inventions for hi tech corporations. Once he's delivered the goods, he allows his memory to be erased - thereby rendering him innocuous as a security threat - in exchange for the lucrative paychecks the companies offer him.
Yet another of the many recent adaptations of a Phillip K. Dick story, ""Paycheck"" begins in the present day, a strange choice on the part of the filmmakers actually, for in this film's view of 2004, the technology for memory erasure seems to be in full swing and widely accepted (perhaps the producers didn't want to have to deal with the expense or bother of creating futuristic designs for their sets and costumes).  The majority of the story, however, takes place in 2007, after Jennings ""wakes up"" from a three-year stint working on a secret project about which he can remember nothing.  The trouble is that things haven't quite worked out the way Jennings planned as he finds himself the quarry of both the FBI and the organization for which he was working.  Of course, Jennings doesn't know why.  As is customary with films of this type, we uncover the clues and piece together the picture right along with the increasingly more enlightened main character.
It's that piecing together that is the sole factor of interest in ""Paycheck,"" for Dick is clearly a writer with a fertile imagination and a gift for mind-bending storytelling. When the film sticks to unraveling its plot complications, it is generally sharp, intriguing and thought-provoking.  Too often, though, the film degenerates into a collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clichs.  Although the special effects are occasionally impressive, the far-too-frequent chase sequences defy all logic and believability.  In fact, a number of scenes actually elicit a few unwanted giggles, so ludicrous and over-the-top are the setup and execution. Director Woo, past master of action spectaculars, is clearly working on autopilot in this film.
There isn't much to say about the acting, either.  Although Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman - as the woman Jennings fell in love with during the three years, but whom he can no longer remember - do their best with the characters assigned to them, neither is given much chance to expand beyond the stereotypical confines of their respective roles.
When it comes to all those involved in this film, I suspect that Jennings isn't the only one here working solely for the paycheck.",1089331200,6,2895,4.952577319587629

2018987,2,B0001NBNF2,"John Woo swings and misses in ""Paycheck,"" a blandy uninvolving adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story of the same name. While it has some definite promise, the ghastly acting of Ben Affleck and the over-actioned story-line make it a mess.
A man named Jennings (Ben Affleck) is a brilliant scientists, who suddenly discovers that his past job, his past boss, and the past three years have all been wiped from his brain. No, it's not some kind of bizarre hangover -- Jennings finds out that he agreed to do some kind of secret work and then have his brain wiped, in exchange for a fortune.

Unfortunately, the ""paycheck"" is one that can't be cashed -- Jennings learns that he gave up the money, and left himself a bag of seemingly random items. Using them, he struggles to find out what he did before his memory was erased, and the secret machine that can change the world as we know it. But now the police are after him, and he's rapidly running out of time.

Erase the scifi element from ""Paycheck,"" and you have a boringly typical action movie -- attractive love interest, hero on the lam, plenty of money and explosions. At times, the talents of Philip K. Dick peep out of the turgid plot, only to be swamped again by another action scene.

""Paycheck"" is unnecessarily heavy on the action: There's a lot of motorcycle acrobatics and stuntman fights, despite the hero being a nerdy engineer. John Woo doesn't seem entirely sure what to do in the scenes that don't involve any action. And the dialogue is straight from bad cop shows: ""Hey, I said you were okay, okay?"" ""Okay!""

But the overactivity of the plot would be okay.... if it didn't have so many holes in it. In any scifi plot, there are going to be holes, but the ones in ""Paycheck"" gape -- some are big enough to make the entire story utterly useless. For example, why didn't Jennings write himself a detailed letter rather than leaving himself cryptic, random clues?

Ben Affleck demonstrates yet again that bland Ken-doll looks are all he has going for him. His acting is nonexistant -- an accusatory ""you erased my memory!"" has less passion in it than ""you botched my dental filling!"" Uma Thurman wanders through looking confused, as if she isn't sure what she's doing in this movie. She does her best to salvage the plot, but there is only so much she can do. And poor Aaron Eckhart is just an Evil Villain.

Bland acting, giant plot holes, and an plot-lite storyline are only a few of the problems dogging this turgid, poorly-adapted action flick. Despite Eckhart and Thurman's best efforts, ""Paycheck"" fails to pay off.",1088726400,,2590,4.631808278867102

I believe this movie represents. together with 'Windtallkers', a new low for him. It's not that the movie is bad. It's just mediocre. The plot is full of holes but seems like nobody really cares about the plot. Ben Affleck turned out not to be a good fit for this role (I anticipated much more from him and was disappointed).

Ben Affleck, who will probably never have an Oscar on his mantle, portrays the hero Michael Jennings with a reserved and pensive demeanor.  I think he captures the confusion of his situation quite well, and while he may appear ""bland,"" I think Woo wanted Affleck to be more enigmatic than adventurous.  Uma Thurman does a nice pre Kill Bill job as Jennings' main squeeze and the delightfully acerbic Aaron Eckhart conveys smooth evil very well.  Eckhart is one of those actors whose time will eventually come.  Add Paul Giamatti, Joe Morton, Michael C. Hall and Colm Feore, and you have a dandy supporting cast.

It is a slightly futurisitic movie with what would seem to be plausible technology for our world only a few years removed.  This movie is fun, the violence is mostly 'offscreen' so there is little or no blood, that was not the point of the movie, it was the action, not many real special effects, so the action was in the acting which really got to me.
Affleck is definately the focus of the movie and he has two friends, one from prior to his three year excursion and one from his three years of work.  Paul Giamatti plays his best friend, Shorty.  You may remember him from Duets, he plays a really affable friend who is reliable.
Uma Thurman plays Rachel, she does a great job as she helps Affleck figure out his predicament.
This movie presents you with a puzzle that you are forced to figure out as Affleck figures it out.

2018994,3,B0001NBNF2,"Having John Woo direct ""Paycheck"" was a big mistake because forcing this film, based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, into a ""Mission: Impossible"" type movie was the wrong move to make.  But after ""Bladerunner"" and ""Minority Report"" Hollywood apparently cannot conceive of doing one of Dick's imaginative science fiction stories as anything other than an action film.  Of course, look at the travesty they have planned for Issac Asimov's ""I Robot"" with its killer robots violating the First Law and I guess we should not be surprised.
There is a major surprise in this film set up by the trailer, which introduces Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck), a brilliant scientist of some sort who does ultra secret jobs, gets his mind blanked for the period he worked, and then picks up a paycheck.  However, after his biggest job instead of a multi-million dollar paycheck he discovers that he has sent himself an envelope with 20 objects that he has never seen before (okay, he has seen them, he just does not remember any of them).  The inference in the trailer is that these are clues as to what he did and why he would give up the biggest paycheck of all.  It has to be something pretty big and pretty bad to give up all that money.  Chase scenes and fights are tangential to that and not all that impressive (the point of a motorcycle is not speed but manuverability, but apparently Jennings is not smart enough to know that and take advantage of it).
But to get back to the crux of the problem with this 2003 film, those items are not clues but something more interesting that should have been the driving force of this story.  On the off chance that has not been given away already by what you have seen and heard about ""Paycheck"" I will refrain from saying more, because when I picked up on what was really happening was when I really got interested in this film.  But Woo focuses on the physical rather than the cerebral and this film jumps off the tracks.  You know things are just plain wrong when the best moves in an action film are done by a robotic machine.
Ultimately, ""Paycheck"" reminds me of the few computer games I have played in the past such as ""Phantasmagoria"" and ""Gabriel Knight,"" and I was excited by that idea.  This film needed to be more like ""Memento,"" where the emphasis is on being clever instead of dumbing everything down to action sequences that are decidedly unimpressive.  There are some great ideas at the heart of this movie but they were quickly forgotten and buried beneath substandard Hollywood schlock.  Besides, after the ""Kill Bill"" films it is hard to see Uma Thurman playing a relatively ordinary woman.  But the main thing here is that once again Hollywood has taken a pretty good idea and thrown it away.",1087084800,,2745,4.600409836065574
2018995,2,B0001NBNF2,"In one of the documentary featurettes included in this ""Paycheck"" DVD it's mentioned that Ben Affleck's role in the film was pattered after Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill in Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"".
That Ben Affleck is no Cary Grant is certainly not news, but the problem is in ""Paycheck"" neither Director John Woo nor screenwriter Dean Georgaris give him much opportunity to be Ben Affleck, an appealing enough personality under the right circumstances.
Despite a plot that's as convuluted as it gets, the dialouge is stilted, the characters are as flat as a Kansas prairie (with the exception of Paul Giamatti who does more with a thankless role that anyone has the right to expect).
John Woo is an old hand at action sequences (isn't anyone sick of car and motorcyles chases by now)? but he has little flair for character and relationships, so when Affleck isn't being chased, beaten up or shot at, things just sort of congeal.
""Paycheck"" might be a good movie to read by, if there was light in the theater.

2019007,4,B0001NBNF2,"First off, John Woo cannot direct actors.  He never has and he never will be able to.  John Woo is an action director, as you all know, ergo, anyone who watched this film and can't get off on the acting should really have know better.
  Every director (short of himself in ""Goodwill"") has had a hard enough time directing Affleck, especially when he is in the throngs of a who-knows-what emotional crisis that really shows in his performance here.  Uma Thurman gives Woo a full plate as well, coming out of the zany postmodern antics of Tarantino's death camp . . .
  This being said, I really loved the premise of this film.  It contained a very ""Minority Report"" feel to it, much like a Philip K Dick short story.  I really wouldn't be suprised if Paycheck is derived from one or more of Phil's more obscure novellas.
  The whole theory of reverse engineer is not only  meta-fascinating to me, I think it is probably already being implimented on primitive commercial/corporate levels, and will probably evolve pretty close to the predictions here.
  Affleck plays an IT mercenary of sorts, out for hire to mimic/ perfect new hardware/software being produced by the worlds best corporations.  He apparently gets in over his head when he accepts a 2 year job (that involves a two year memory swipe as well) that turns out to e a disaster.  The plot interfacing with the near-future time era is inconsistent if you pay attention, yet not overly abrasive.  I feel they execute plot very well in the film.  I loved the science fiction behind all of the gadgetry and and effectual reality, and I felt the concepts were portrayed solidly.
  Woo does a great job in the action sequences messing with all sorts of science fiction contraptions and creating creative visual concepts in fighting scenarios.  He has always been able to shoot action scenes where people are creatively killed/ miraculously escape.
  If you love sci-fi, and you know better than to get your hopes up for incredible acting, you will really enjoy this film, as I did.  I went into my viewing of it with a 'rock-film-like' mentality and came away intellectually stimulated.  There are a series of subtle clues and philosophical tip-offs that really make this movie interesting to see how it all plays out.

If you are looking for something more along the lines of what PKD writes, this doesn't make the grade (except in one area, mentioned below), despite its origin. While I'm not familiar with the short story, I am familiar with PKD's writings and this does not fit his style.
What this is, is a well-executed action-adventure film that has an element of SF in a present-day earth setting. Forget the chemistry between Thurman and Affleck (Thurman doesn't have chemistry in most of her films, anyway), the film is a nice little puzzle that carries you along with Affleck's character. After last year's raft of blockbusters, it isn't surprising to see films like this one disappoint so many people. This is no comic book adaptation of a superhero, though the previews might lead to suspect it is. It is nothing more than a mystery with an element of time travel mixed in (actually, there isn't any time travel involved... I said element and that's different).
Is the story plausible? Well, the science isn't exactly current at any level, mostly because we don't have anything to remotely resemble it. So don't look for familiar theories validated through the story line. PKD never did that much, anyway... he was a futurist (i.e., Bladerunner) who liked to give us puzzles and some humor. Humor, this lacks, but that's okay because it is generally a serious film.
But is the story plausible? Yes, as long as you don't try to tie in our current science (theoretical and practical). Let yourself go when you watch this and enjoy it for what it is...

The story is different, which is what I like.  However, the thing that makes the movie neat gets old after seeing it work 5 times... and you need to watch all 20 fall into place to solve the big mystery.
There was one thing that really erked me, only because it happened in Minority Report as well.  I work with computers, and therefore, security.  I've got it down so that anybody who leaves the company usually can't get back through the security system before they even leave the door the last time.

His services are often used by a company owned by a friend of his. While he receives big checks, the company demands that, in order to keep their intellectual property safe, Michael's memory of the period during which he worked for them will be erased.
Michael gets hired for his biggest job ever: A three year contract, worth 90 million dollars. A close friend tries to persuade him not to do it, but in vain.
After the three years are up and Michael tries to cash in his paycheck, it turns out that he cancelled the check a few weeks in advance. As if that's not bad enough, his personal belongings that he had to stash away before he started the three-year period, have been switched with other stuff. This, again, was done by himself. Because his memory was erased though, Michael has absolutely no idea what's going on.
To top it off, it turns out he's wanted by the Feds who want to question him about his work. This kicks off a series of events in which Michael will have to discover what he did for the company, why he would possibly sign a document waving the 90 million dollars away, and what went on during the missing three years.

While Uma Thurman's performance is convincing, I had a hard time imagining the two of them being friends, let alone lovers. I especially had difficulty imagining Affleck as a hacker, or anyone in possession of half-a-brain for that matter.

I simply could not remember how it ended because I'd lost all interest midway through. In considering the movie, the word `insipid' comes to mind.
The premise is ridiculous. A man named Michael [Ben Affleck] is well paid by a nefarious corporation run by James Rethrick [Aaron Eckhart] to carry out jobs which require his memory to be erased at the end of each one. When he is offered a job which will wipe out two or three years of his life, he hesitates but is soon lured by an astronomical paycheck. When he `comes to' at the end of his mission, he finds that he has forfeited his pay. Then he receives a mysterious package containing several seemingly unrelated items. He goes on a hunt to discover the truth, no easy task considering that he can't remember anything.
The plots of most sci-fi movies are ridiculous. The good ones, though, cause us to suspend disbelief, at least until after the movie is over. The great ones make us want really to believe the premise and to cast logic to the wind. [""Alien"" comes to mind.] ""Paycheck"" simply makes us roll our eyes and shake our heads.
The other problem is Ben Affleck as the main character. I don't know if he really can't act, or if he has lately been so preoccupied that he doesn't feel like acting. Here, he tries vainly to act against the fine Mr. Eckhart and the incredible Uma Thurman.

I should however have known not to expect too much from this movie, with John Woo directing.
I should have known exactly what to expect: car crashes, a million rounds of ammo expended ( with no one hit), more car chases, more ammo, and just to keep the audience guessing - to my shock, something no one would have ever expected - a motorcycle chase. Who could have imagined?
Somehow Jennings could not find the skill or the speed in a BMW motorcyce to outrun a Ford Crown Vic yet had not trouble evading an FBI helicopter. Man those Crown Vics really go. They fly and
explode well too - all in slow motion.
I was expecting a taut psychological thriller with some action similar to Total Recall or Imposter ( other Phillip K. Dick adaptations) but what we get is a typical Woo. Set up a mysterious and intriguing scenario, sprinkle it with suspense and uncertaintly and begin an almost Hitchcock-ian style premise - then develop none of it. (Face Off and Windtalkers - other cases in point)
In Woo movies, machine guns, bombs and car crashes are substituted for plot points. Despite all the shooting and blowing up I never really saw Jennings in great danger. The biggest concern I had for the hero was that all those flying bullets might muss up his hair requiring him to take a time out
for the ""Queer Eye"" guys to touch up his looks.
Affleck went through the entire film with the same deadpad expression whether he had a gun to his head or was kissing the girl, He had the same perfectly coiffured hair - never one out of place no matter how many bullets zinged past him. Thankfully the girl brought him new clothes after he managed to get a 1"" grease mark on his shirt after almost getting run over by a subway train.
Jennings love interest played by Uma Thurmond was well cast, but there seemed to be no on screen chemistry between them. Their scenes together seemed passionless. If I were opposite Uma I can
guarantee you there would have been sparks at loeast from my side! ( in my dreams of course). With Jennings however, she was just another character along for the ride.
I guess we can thankful that Woo resisted the temptation to include his signature ""flying through the air in slow motion sideways while shooting from a pistol in each hand"" stunts. I gave the movie an additional star just for that.
Aaron Eckhart did a fine job as a villan albeit more of a comic book composite bad guy typical of Woo movies with no depth or personality. For a computer company he sure seemed to have a lot armed security guys around all willing to kill and die for $8.50/hour. I'd hate to see his Workers Comp premiums.
It was okay as an action movie, but it missed so many opportunities to tease the audience with intrique and mystery like Verhooven did with Total Recall. In TR you really were never quite sure if it was real or a dream you were often led in both directions at the same time.  This movie could have used elements like that to blow our minds and add so much depth to the story.
Here, the ""mystery"" was pretty much obvious almost right away then lacking anything else interesting to do Woo started blowing things up. There were no significant plot twists to hold the audience and keep un in any suspense. To Woo, a plot twist is a villan using a pistol instead of a machine gun.
There several 0pportunities to surprise us, but Woo ignored them all lighting off the submachine guns instead.
The movie is by no means dull and boring I actually enjoyed it, even the ending ( both of them), but this film could have been so much more. I did think it was a waste of a perfectly good P.K. Dick story. With a few script revisions this could have easily been morphed into MI3 instead and Paycheck left to Paul Verhooven (Total Recall) or Gary Fleder (Imposter).",1085184000,,4640,4.517241379310345

Mission Impossible 1 was very well done and had lots of twists, it kept me watching on the edge of my seat. MI2 was horribly generic, it was predictable and mindless, MI1 was clever and pleasantly confusing, Face Off was dijointed but also cleverly done. Woo, it seems, makes either generic Hollywood action or clever twisty plots. Paycheck falls into the first catagory, it is predictable.
The plot is about an engineer, Ben Affleck who is hired to do a job, but his memory is erased. Predicting this might happen, he leaves himself clues and falls in love with Uma Therman who tries to help him. He also misses out on 90 million bucks due to Aron Eckhart, who he finally hunts down. So, it has potential, but nothing really gets going. Affleck doesnt do much acting, and the little he does is average,  and Therman is nowhere near as good as she was in Kill Bill.

Once you buy the somewhat improbable premise, it holds together in an interesting way. (Memory is encoded, partly, in the physical structure of nerve cells. I don't think it can be wiped clean as easily as they suggest.) We have good reason for having no clue what's going on, and that gets things going.

The good guy lives happily ever after with the leading lady, and it's generally satisfying as amusement when I wasn't free to do much else. My one remaining question is, if Our Hero is trying to live the rest of his life with a low profile, how will he ever cash that paycheck?

I can only think of one redeming part--a shot of Affleck falling to his soppused death--is classic Woo (complete with the cross and dove).  However, the film is very restrained in the action.  This being a PG-13 vechicle, it does not give Woo the room to make the action he is most noted for.  One sad examble is Affleck doesn't use a gun all that much in the film (so no two fisted gun blazing christ like hero in this one).  The dramatic care chase was boring--I think it was because I knew they were not in Seattle and so I was put off on the reference to streets in Seattle.
I generally, enjoy films by John Woo (granted his American Films are not as great as his Hong Kong Films), I usually know to expect great action--well, unfortuantely it's not in this film.

Ok, so the characters are a bit too typical: Ben Affleck plays the average hero, Uma Thurman is his pretty and smart girlfriend, Paul Giamatti shines as the comic relief loser and Aaron Eckhart gives shape to the cold-hearted, one-dimensional villain. Still, it`s a solid action movie nonetheless, and it provides a couple of well-crafted energetic scenes with some interesting twists along the way. Not a masterpiece, just a good sci-fi adventure that`s way better than most blockbusters around.
Worth a look.",1080345600,,870,5.451851851851852
2019046,3,B0001NBNF2,"Paycheck has a cool if somewhat recycled premise: our protagonist (in this case, an engineer played by square-jawed Beniffer - I mean Ben Affleck) works on reverse-engineering projects and then has his memory wiped so that there's no evidence left behind. But then comes along the job of his life - a multimillion dollar deal that has one catch...he must lose three years of his memory.
So Michael Jennings (Affleck), who is a greedy bastard, takes the deal. A lot can happen in three years and of course, he manages to fall in love with the doctor (Uma Thurman) who he had a brief flirtation with at a party. He also worked on a top-secret project (it's spoiler time folks, so get ready)...
[...] Jennings of course wants no part of the project so he has to send himself secret coded notes in the form of 20 generic, boring everyday items. Then he gives up all that money to ""keep him focused on those 20 items.""
The movie's plot is intriguing. The initial science of memory wiping seems plausible. Jennings brain must be kept at a certain temperature or he ""turns into a vegetable"" during a process where they literally zap brain cells away. You lose brain cells every day, so this isn't quite as awful as it sounds. Of course, one of the problems is that the guy who does the zapping sees on screen what Jennings saw. So should HE have to be zapped too? Shouldn't it be an automated process run by a machine or something?
There are a lot of plot holes like that, and once you go down that path the movie turns into a big, breezy pile of Swiss cheese. As I work for a Fortune 5 company myself, I know for a fact that if a highflying executive sold all his stock or gave up his shares, he'd be immediately called into an office to ask why. People don't just give up millions of dollars because they're having a bad day.
The second memory wipe is also plausible - they insert a tracer into Jennings and then, when the three years are up, follow back to the point of the tracer and chemically wipe his brain. Since it's a chemical process, it's an imperfect one and Jennings has dreams and nightmares of what he saw.
[...]
John Woo has an issue with pacing. It's obvious he wants to show off his martial arts filming techniques and there are plenty of opportunities for Jennings to do just that. But they drag on too long. Jennings is also a fantastic motorcyclist - bizarre, since Rachel (Thurman) tells him he's ""only okay"" on the bike. Then we're subjected to a 10-minute-too-long action sequence of Jennings and Rachel being chased by cop cars, bad guys, and multiple car explosions.
This happens again and again. The protagonists get into a tight spot and some of the time, Jennings McGyvers his way out. The rest of the time, he fights his way out. The engineer. Fighting his way out like a Marine.
There's no chemistry between Thurman and Affleck. I'm not sure how there could be. I'm so accustomed to seeing Uma in movies where she's a tough, pushy, almost manly character that seeing her in pink and giggling seemed extremely out of character. Affleck does a fair job of trying to be bewildered and compassionate at the same time, but nowhere is there any evidence of the incredible brilliance that Jennings used to create the device or negotiate his way through the future.
To sum up, Paycheck has all the twists of Total Recall but drags on its action sequences too long; it has all the mystery of Minority Report but not enough technical savvy to convince us it's a possible future; all the mind-bending antics of Memento but not enough carefully crated design to be a brilliant script, all the apocalyptic predictions of Terminator 3 but not the strength of its convictions to end the movie on a low note.",1079913600,,3717,4.524517087667162
2019047,2,B0001NBNF2,"""Paycheck"" is quite enjoyable if you can forget the fact that it is based on Philip K. Dick's novel, which previously inspired such films as ""Blade Runner"" ""Total Recall"" or ""Minority Report.""  As you see, his novels have many brilliant ideas, one of which ""Paycheck"" tries to use -- that is, ""wipe out your memory, and make money.""
Ben Affleck is Jennings, whose shady job is to re-invent the products of rival company, and make it a better one.  After that process, he undergoes a 'wipe-out' process of his memory with a help from his only friend Paul Giamatti.  This is not a healthy job, he knows, with too much pressure on his brain, but it pays.
Then the sinister-looking Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) comes to Jennings, offering the most lukelative job -- three years' work in his company.  Of course, this means that he has to erase three years memories of his life, but he can get a paycheck with huge numbers, so why not do it?
But, after the three years, what he got turns out a manila envelope, in which he finds 19 seemingly meaningless objects.  Who did that, and more importantly, why?
The original concept is good, but John Woo refuses to handle the matter in a way that would suit a Sci-fi genre.  His approach is more like a Hitchcock-like, cat-and-mouse chase action, which comprises many set-pieces of car chase, gun-shooting, and explosions.  And he does not forget to include a white dove and the men pointing guns to each other.
What I do not understand is, though the film belongs to science fiction, it fails to convey the feeling of near-future world.  In fact, you see the year 2007, and there is little touch of futuristic world, for which Philip K Dick's name is invoked.  The technology looks scarcely progressed when the fire alarm is activated by cigarette's smoke.  In the futute (and Dick's future in particular), chances are people are not allowed to smoke.
But these things can be forgivable if the actions are good.  Actually, they are not bad, just average.  However, we have seen superb ""Minority Report"" (especially its opening 15 minutes), in which the futuristic technology hightened the suspence of the impending murder in a terrific way.  We want that sense of thrill, which is not to be seen here.
More problems: actors.  Ben Affleck is good in ""Daredevil,"" and usually a reliable actor who can suit the heroic figure, but his character looks very bland.  Aaron Eckhart is a typical villain, which is nothing I complain (just OK), but most disappointing is Uma Thurman, who plays the obligatory role of potential love interest to Ben's role, which is painful to see.  Remember, this film was shot after Tarantino's ""Kill Bill,"" and that means she could be in a fit condition to do a bit of physical action.  No, John Woo somehow ignores the opportunities to make her kick and punch, which is quite unaccountable.
Please, please, Hollywood studios, give me something more original -- Sci-fi gadgets or something -- than guns and explosives, next time you use the name of Philip K. Dick, whose genius was mostly ignored while he was alive.",1079308800,2,3077,4.753759398496241
2019048,1,B0001NBNF2,"Philip K. Dick was one of America's finest science fiction writers, not so much for his characterisation or actual writing but more for the quality of ideas. Those ideas have been translated into several interesting movies including ""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"". ""Minority Report"", and the less well known ""Impostor"", and ""Screamers"".
Now it's the turn of former Hong Kong director John Woo to take on Philip K Dick in the movie ""Paycheck"". For uncritical John Woo fans it may have something to offer. For fans of science-fiction it's a much less rewarding enterprise.
Engineering wizard Michael Jennings (played by Ben Affleck) has voluntarily agreed to have his memory wiped. He's employed by big corporations to reverse engineer the inventions of others, so that they can market the product for themselves. To escape detection they clean his memory of all knowledge of what he has done.
Usually Jennings gives up a couple of months of his memories at a time, but on this occasion he takes on a three year job from an old friend Rethrick (Aaron Eckhardt). WE can see Rethrick is a bad guy in about 30 seconds, but despite having known him since they were kids, Jennings has never managed to figure this out. Maybe his brain works only on computers.
Jennings is told that that job will earn him an eight figure sum in terms of stock options, and he'll never have to work again. It seems too good to be true, and it is. When he returns to the world after having had his memory wiped, he discovers that he has earned nothing at all. He's forfeited his stock options and left himself an envelope of personal possessions filled with items he doesn't recognize. He has to figure out what these items mean, or what they are for, if he wants to unravel the mystery.
Not long after discovering that he has no money, Jennings is apprehended by the FBI who use their own methods to try to retrieve whatever's in his mind. He manages to escape form them using the objects he has in his envelope, and it becomes apparent - through one message he sent to himself in the envelope - that he somehow has knowledge of the future, and that if he uses these objects at the right time and in the right way he will survive it.
Plot hole number one. If the future is unchangeable anyway, then it doesn't really matter what he does with the objects he has had sent to himself. And if it's changeable then much of the central concept of the film, which I won't give away too much, is complete nonsense.
Of course one problem with this idea is that if the central character knows what's going to happen anyway and knows how to get out of it where's the suspense for the movie audience? Well the best thing the film-makers can come up with is one recurring image he keeps having of a bullet flying right at him that he doesn't know how to get away from. That's the only suspense we have up until the scene actually occurs.
What is reality? What does it mean to be human? These are questions that fascinated Philip K. Dick. But neither John Woo nor screenwriter Dean Georgaris are really up to the task of dealing with these intellectual concerns. Instead they change it into a chase thriller, with a little cursory romance thrown in, in which the character has most of the tools needed for his survival in his hands.
The cursory romance is provided by Uma Thurman as biologist Dr. Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman), who for some reason manages to research for the same company without having her memory wiped. After taking on the central role in ""Kill Bill"" it's must be a thankless task to be cast as the generic girlfriend in a John Woo movie. Romance isn't a big thing in Woo's universe, and is usually handled by having the man and woman look at each other in slow motion while the camera moves.
Other elements are pinched from other movies based on Dick's stories. Two scenes are stolen from ""Minority Report"" alone, one in which he is reverse-engineering someone else's invention, the other of which takes place in a shopping mall, and uses a balloon in the right place at the right time.
Not much here is not predictable. Including the fact that even though Affleck is playing the ultimate nerd, he also knows martial arts, and how to do hair riaising motor-bike stunts. You can only find yourself groaning when you see Affleck using an old kung fu movie routine to show that his memory wipe hasn't damaged his co-ordination.
""Face/Off"" showed that John Woo could work well with a science fiction concept IF that sci-fi concept didn't require too much analysis or thought and if it dovetailed with his longstanding movie concerns. ""Paycheck"" is Woo on autopilot, and Philip K Dick's original idea is wasted. And someone should tell the director that repeating the same shot of a dove flying in slow motion in every darned film you make is NOT a sign of directorial style. I like birds, but I wish someone would roast this one. Spend your money on ""Paycheck"" and you might be willing to pay to have your memory wiped of that decision.",1078531200,6,5011,4.59375

2019053,4,B0001NBNF2,"In 2003, Paycheck was made into a adventure-thriller starting Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman. In the movie version, Jennings has done the mind-erase engineering jobs several times and we meet him BEFORE he goes into his long, 2 year project with Rethrick. He meets Rachel, a biologist, shortly before starting his work. When he gets out, he gets an envelope of trinkets from a bank lady. He's furious at not getting his $90 million dollars even though it was himself (pre-amnesia) who agreed to the change. He uses a few trinkets to get out of jams before he realizes that he must have given himself those trinkets, and therefore he was able to see the future at the time.
He uses the trinkets one by one to help him escape both the cops, who want to know what he did for Rethrick, and Rethrick's goonies, who now wants him dead. It turns out that during the 2 years, Jennings has fallen in love with Rachel and the two meet up together at a restaurant based on Jenning's trinkets. Rachel of course agrees to help him out.
Jennings decides he has to get back to the laboratory and see what he was working on. Meanwhile, Rethrick realizes Jennings has fouled up the time viewer and plans on letting Jennings succeed so Jennings will fix the viewer, then catch him again. Jennings does indeed fix the viewer using a pretty lame clue and looks into the future. He realizes that knowledge of the future will doom mankind to wars and destruction because it will destroy free will. He therefore plans on destroying the machine. As this was directed by John Woo, there is a fantastic ending battle and the machine is destroyed, and in the end it turns out that Jennings used his future-vision to help them win the lottery, so now Jennings and Rachel are millionaires.
My Notes -
Good God Almighty. Yes, I thought the original story had some flaws because the main character was selfish and greedy. So what the movie did was keep the character flaws and completely destroy the plotline as well. First, some critics picked on Affleck and Thurman as being non-spectacular. Well, yes! This isn't Minority Report, where the hero is a seasoned cop, nor is it Blade Runner, where the hero is ... a seasoned cop. The hero here is an ENGINEER, an average guy trying to think his way out of a complex situation. I thought Affleck did a great job of doing that. He's not a Government Agent. He's a computer nerd. Uma is equally not a Charlie's Angel, she's a biologist who loves an engineer. They both show the intelligence and loyalty that are integral to their characters.
But back to the plot. In the original story, Rethrick was a 'good' company who dealt with Jennings honorably, having him build something critical to them preserving knowledge until government stability came around again. But in the movie, Rethrick is an evil company out to cause harm. In the book, Jennings is just avoiding the police until he can blackmail Rethrick and become ""safe"" as part of the company. In the movie, Jennings is fighting on all fronts AND has a loyal love interest by his side. And instead of blackmailing the company and forcing a woman to be his wife, he destroys a company and manipulates the state lottery to give him millions of dollars. Neither one seems very inspiring to me.
But even worse, we are back to the same free will screw-up that happened with Minority Report. In BOTH Minority Report and Paycheck, Philip K Dick said clearly in his stories that the future is set, that there is a way to see what is in the future and that this knowledge is a GOOD thing. In both stories, the ending is that the future-vision remains in place. But Hollywood seems to have huge issues with this concept. In both movie versions, it is somehow FREE WILL that triumphs. The future-viewing is seen as a HUGE threat and is destroyed quite forcefully. You almost have to wonder if there is some sort of agenda going on in Hollywood, that they fear the loss of free will and are therefore completely altering any storyline that speaks out against it.
In the story version, the ending has Rethrick surviving as a storehouse of knowledge to safeguard the future, sort of like the Irish monks keeping safe the tomes of knowledge during the dark ages. But in the movie version, Jennings gleefully destroys Rethrick because ""knowledge is dangerous"" and then uses his power to rig the lottery! And this is supposed to be a good thing??
I really have to wonder just why both of these stories (Minority Report and Paycheck) were altered 180 degrees from the original intent, in the exact same fashion, only a year apart. I can only hope that the movies have inspired people to go back and read the original stories, and then put some thought into the differences and what they mean.",1075852800,3,4744,4.615384615384615
2019054,3,B0001NBNF2,"A film by John Woo
Once upon a time a film directed by John Woo meant something.  He was a well known and well respected director from Hong Kong.  His first couple of pictures in America, while not spectacular, were fairly good: ""Broken Arrow"" and ""Face/Off"".  Unfortunately, since ""Face/Off"" he has been moderately disappointing.  ""Paycheck"" is not a step in the right direction.
After the success of ""Minority Report"" it seemed that stories by Philip K. Dick are back in demand (he also wrote the story that was the basis of ""Blade Runner"").  ""Paycheck"" is the story of Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck), a reverse engineer.  A reverse engineer works for a company and takes an existing product (typically that of a competitor), takes it apart to see how it was built, and then puts it back together while improving it so that the new company can profit from someone else's original design.  After this work is done, the memory of the reverse engineer is erased so that he does not know what project he worked on, only that he got paid.  Michael Jennings is an engineer in demand.  He takes on a large project from his friend James Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart).  This job can take up to three years, which is a large period of his life to be erased from his memory, but Rethrick assured Michael that the payoff, the paycheck will be worth it.  Michael accepts the job and follows through with it, it is suggested, in part because he meets a woman named Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman).
In the blink of an eye, three years pass.  Michael has no idea what just happened because his memory was just wiped.  Rethrick tells him that he is done with the project.  Michael goes home, checks his account balance and sees that he is now 93 million dollars richer, but when he returns to collect his possessions, the items in the envelope are not his own and his money is gone.  He is told that he forfeited his shares of stock and mailed himself the envelope.  Now United States government is after him for a case of potential treason and Michael Jennings has no idea what he did for the past three years.
This is an interesting enough concept and I would be interested to read Philip K Dick's story.  John Woo just did not get the job done.  It turns out to be a fairly typical action movie, and not at all as clever as I had expected (or as the film itself suggests it could be with the envelope full of strange items).  ""Paycheck"" is bland and dull, and at times it is also silly.  When I think about how good Uma Thurman has been in other movies, it is really disappointing, because she is forced to deliver really bad lines and she doesn't make them sound any better.  Some scenes, like a big explosion late in the movie, just go on too long and try to do too much, and by the end, I was just glad it was over.  This isn't worth recommending and it really isn't worth renting.  Just skip this one.",1075680000,,2884,4.430740037950664
2019077,2,B0001NBNF2,"When I first saw previews for this movies, I was very excited.  I knew that it had been adapted from a Phillip K. Dick short story, the guy who wrote the inspiration for Minority Report, which I loved.  The previews made this movie look like it had it all; a good plot, cool stunts, and great effects.  Well, more or less, it did have all of those.  The thing that it lacked was acting talent.
To say that this movie disappointed me would be an understatement.  As I said, the story, effects, and stunts were all up to par, but I could not concentrate on them due to Ben Affleck's HORRIBLE performance.  The other actors were bad, but nowhere near Affleck.  Also, it seemed that whenever Affleck was on-screen, he brought down the performances of his costars.
Anyway, here's the story.  A few decades in the future, Affleck plays Michael Jennings,a reverse engineer; he takes apart existing products to find out how they work, then builds newer and better models for rival companies.  When he is finished with his jobs, his old bosses erase his memory so that he won't tell the company's secrets.  Soon, Jennings is approached by his old friend Jimmy Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart) with a proposal for a job that will make them both very rich men.  The catch is that it will require three years of his life to complete.  Jennings agrees, but when three years are up and his mind is erased, Jennings learns that he forfeited his paycheck, and instead receives an envelope containing nineteen strange items that don't seem to have any connection to each other, which makes sense because they have nothing to do with each other.  They each serve a purpose in helping Jennings find the truth about what he did for three years.  Along the way, he rekindles a romance with Rachel Porter (Uma Thurman), who he met during his tenure with Rethrick's company.
This is a John Woo film, so we are guaranteed good action sequences.  We got his trademark motorcycle chase, and the ending shootout was good, but after a while, I started wondering how an engineer became such a Superman.  Well, I guess that there could have been worse problems with the story.
I have read that Matt Damon was originally considered for the Jennings role, but he didn't take it because it was too similar to The Bourne Identity.  Why didn't he take this role?  He is such a better actor than Affleck, and he could have possibly saved this movie.  But alas, we are stuck with this Affleck-induced bomb.  Too bad.",1075593600,3,2471,4.623853211009174
2019078,3,B0001NBNF2,"The critics all agreed. ""Paycheck,"" was a bad movie. But what do I have to say about it? I liked it.
I like Ben Afflick. I really do. I like the movies that he chooses. I liked ""Gigli,"" alot. I enjoyed ""Daredevil."" ""Chasing Amy,"" was pretty good, and I loved ""Dogma."" But this review is about his preformance in ""Paycheck."" Nothing that he does in the past is going to change how I felt about him in this movie. I thought he was pretty bad in this movie, but he doesn't hold the candle to the preformance of Uma Thurman which was just the worst acting that I ever saw. Her preformance cost the movie a star and a half, and the other half a star was because of the weak, but good preformance of Ben Afflick. The biggest and only problem with this movie was the preformances.
I really loved the story. It was just so brilliant and clever, and interesting. It begins in the present year and we are introduced to Michael Jennings who is hired by companies to update current technologies for them. But the deal is that once he does his work for them, they wipe his mind of all memory of him working there. His next client is an old friend of his, Jimmy Rethrick, and it is for three years of work. He relizes that he is not going to miss the three years of something that he is not going to remember, so he says yes. He also says yes because he is going to be working with Racheal Porter, played by Uma Thurman. He also says yes for the 90-something millions dollar paycheck.
Three Years Later...
He's done. They wipe his memory and he goes to collect his paycheck, when he discovers that he gave up his money in exchange for an envelope containing nineteen everyday items. What I could remember:
1)key card
2)crossword puzzle
3)lighter
4)bullet
5)ring
I can't remember the others but those and the other items confuse Micheal, because he can't figure out why he would give up all that money for these stupid items. More problems arise when he is arrested by two agents who demand to know what he has been doing for the past three years because it is a matter of secruity. He escapes from the police, and goes looking for Jimmy. Jimmy is surprised that Micheal is not dead yet and sends Wolfe to go and do the deed. Micheal finds Racheal and together they find out that Micheal left himself the clues to stops something horrible from happening... in the future.
The great part about ""Paycheck,"" is that the story, and what happens throughout the film, is go clever and interesting that I was engaged throughout the whole film. I even liked the final twist, or trick, during the last scene of the movie. I only wish that the makers found a better actress to play Racheal then Uma Thurman because I felt that she did a terrible job in it. I thought that she was brilliant in ""Kill Bill, Volume One,"" but she just didn't make the cut in this one. This would have been a perfect film if the actors just worked alot more on their preformances. Aaron Eckhart as Jimmy was good, but Afflick and Thurman really needed some work. I liked it!
ENJOY!
Rated PG-13 for intense action violence and brief language.",1074384000,,3094,4.401396160558464
2019079,3,B0001NBNF2,"How can you not go see a movie directed by John Woo (even if you won't admit to anyone that you turned Hard Boiled off after 10 minutes)? Okay, so I'm a kung fu poser. That's all right, because Paycheck is more of a run-of-the-mill action movie than an artistic, ""balletic"" John Woo movie (remember when everyone used the word ""balletic"" to describe Mission Impossible II?). Woo throws in some of his trademarks (a dove, Mexican standoffs, lots of action), but this movie is more Hollywood than Hong Kong.
Based on a story by Philip K. Dick (author of the stories that inspired Minority Report and Total Recall), Paycheck has an intriguing setup. Ben Affleck is a reverse engineer who does freelance jobs creating competitive technology for a company (ubiquitously named ""Allcom""). At the end of each stint with Allcom, he has his memory wiped clean. He signs on for an eight-figure paycheck on a tour that will take three years of his life and memory.
At the point where his three year contract ends, his memory is erased, after which he finds out that his $90 million in stock dividends has been forfeited, and all he is left with is the contents of a manila envelope. Action ensues.
The setup for this movie is top notch. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first 30 minutes of the film. Although entertaining, the rest of Paycheck lapses into more predictable Hollywood action fare.
This movie is not completely mind numbing, though. Paycheck is reminiscent of old Hitchcock movies, mostly North By Northwest. Affleck is styled to resemble Cary Grant-the swarthy complexion, the dark, slick hairdo, the crisp white shirts and tailored suits. He manages to shed his J-Lo/Gigli baggage for this film and turns in one of his most convincing (and best acted) performances to date.
A cold-blooded Colm Feore is the only notable supporting actor in the film, delivering a mean performance as a bad guy. Uma Thurman is ungainly and awkward in her role as Affleck's love interest. Paul Giamatta's role as Affleck's right hand man is inexplicable, as he drops in and out of the story at random, almost as an afterthought.
Paycheck is not a Christmas movie. If Paycheck had been released mid-autumn, it would have done moderately well. The studio suits should have realized that the hype surrounding other big movies of the weekend would drown out the weaker pull of this movie. Even if it was directed by John Woo.",1073865600,2,2454,4.790094339622642
2019080,1,B0001NBNF2,"Paycheck is utterly atrocious. Please, please don't waste your hard earned money on this pathetic excuse for a movie. It's an INSULT to people's intelligence. Acting in this movie must have been hardly any work at all! No one had any complicated or lengthy lines to learn that's for sure!
The most appalling part of this movie however is (the normally good looking) Uma Thurman's ghastly appearance, especially her hair; did anyone notice how dry, brittle, knotty and yucky it looks? Her face looks so weird. Her skin is so greasy and blotchy like she's having an allergic reaction to something (perhaps to Ben's acting or the claptrap script?). It makes me so annoyed that Bennifer has gotten a cool few million in his account for this tripe. Hey Ben! I hope you spend some of it on some acting lessons or shampoo and deep conditioner for Uma!",1073520000,5,844,4.70945945945946
2019081,2,B0001NBNF2,"I went in to Paycheck with low expectations and it was just as I thought it would be - boring.
The basic story is Michael Jennings (Ben Affleck) plays a reverse engineer who does work for companies then gets his mind wiped afterwards, just picks up the paycheck and has no idea what he did for the last several months.  He meets up with a friend of his, Jimmy Rethrick (played by Aaron Eckhart of the Core and Erin Brockovich), who offers him a job.  The catch is that it's going to be a 3 year job and the entire 3 years will be wiped from his memory when its over.
He takes the job and afterwards goes to pick up his 92 million dollar paycheck only to find he forfeited all funds and sent himself 19 apparently useless items, that end up being clues and lifesavers that help him figure out what he did the last 3 years that was so bad.  The only interesting part about the movie was seeing how each item was used in an interesting way to further the plot.  Also starring in the movie as Michael's girlfriend (whom he no longer remembers since his mind was wiped) is Kill Bill's Uma Thurmon (who can do SO much better than this!).
The action scenes are just ""ok"" and very typical John Woo (lots of cars that randomly blow up.. if cars in real life blew up as easily as they do in John Woo films, I would be dead right now!).  I did enjoy the BMW motorcycle chase, which was probably the best action sequence of the entire film.
The dialogue is horrible as is the casting.  Although I get made fun of a lot for it, I do like Ben Affleck and when he's cast right, I think he's a great actor.  I think he did just ok in this role.  Uma Thurmon is a fantastic actress, but the writing for her part was just horrible.  And whoever did her hair needs to find a new job - they made her look absolutely terrible.
The film is full of ridiculous events, real forehead slappers.  One of the most memorable is when Michael is being questioned by the FBI, who for some reason have him in a chair that revolves around and around and around, and they have the camera moving around it as well, it almost made me dizzy.  Then for some reason, one of the FBI agents lights one of the cigarettes from Michael's envelope, which sets off a smoke detector.  You'd think these agents would KNOW there are smoke detectors and NOT light a cigarette.  Anyways, Michael fortunately has some glasses in his envelope that help him see through the powder fire prevention system that has all the FBI agents bumbling around like idiots because they can't see.  (Great system!  If there is a fire and this goes off, no one will be able to see!  They'll all fumble around like chickens with their heads cut off and eventually die because they can't get anywhere!)
The concept of the film is interesting and I'm willing to forgive that most movies involving time travel or ""seeing of the future"" will have unexplainable plot holes, this one was just poorly done.  The ending especially is anticlimactic and just plain BAD.  I give it two stars because while the writing was terrible, I did enjoy parts of it (mostly I enjoyed anticipating what each item would be used for).",1073520000,4,3139,4.345890410958904
2019082,2,B0001NBNF2,"John Woo's ""Paycheck"" takes its intriguing ""Remember the Future"" premise from a Phillip K. Dick story and turns it into a rather humdrum, by-the-books action movie with a terrible, terrible ending that feels like it was tacked on to the final reel.
Trying to echo ""Minority Report,"" ""Paycheck,"" with the exception of one twist, instead echoes every movie with a chase scene about a wrongly-accused guy running from the law. Yeah, it's that boring.
Our generic hero in this one is Ben Affleck, who seems bored and uninspired in his performance as a ""reverse engineer"" who steals and copies trademark-protected programs. Early in the film, when Affleck creates a program involving a portable porn star, the audience is shown that he has his memory erased after breaking copyright law for companies so, that way, he can't testify against them.
(As a side note, Paul Giamatti, playing Affleck's brain-erasing sidekick, should REALLY stop taking these parts. I mean, after revealing his genius in AMERICAN SPLENDOR, he shouldn't do this wacky sidekick kind of work anymore. His scenes are PAINFUL - only because it feels like he's pandering.)
After that early set of scenes and pointless, chemistry-deficient scenes introducing his character to the capable-of-much-better Uma Thurman's wacky biologist love-interest, Affleck agrees to work with Aaron Eckhart's character, an evil and slimy millionaire.
Once the real plot of the movie kicks in, a memoryless Affleck tries to figure out how trinkets he sent himself in his past will help him survive the future. And he knows the future because the evil millionaire had him build a machine to see it.
If this movie had been at all inspired, it would've cast Eckhart as the guy wrongly accused and Affleck as the smarmy, evil billionaire. The actors would've better fit the roles, and the film would've, frankly, been more interesting.
If this movie actually cared enough about its plot to create an interesting film around it, as ""Minority Report"" did, then there would be more to say. But there isn't, aside from the usual.
As in every John Woo film, things blow up. There are car chases. People get shot, and white doves show up for no reason whatsoever. (What's with the doves, anyway???)

Dick, and squanders the possibilities with his usual overdose of wannabe, ""look-ma-I'm-cool"" gimmicks and completely pointless fight scenes. How many times can the hero be toe to toe with a villain, each with a gun in the other's face and then just walk away?

2019107,2,B0001NBNF2,"Given a dozen lifetimes and an endless supply of opium, Nostrodamus himself could never have predicted the surreal conjuncture of three such personalities as Philip K. Dick, Ben Affleck, and John Woo. But then, the Hollywood film industry in the twenty-first century is a world bizarre beyond words. Even Rod Serling could not have written of stranger circumstances. Yet there it was unfolding on the cinema screen before my very eyes. I suppose worse things could happen, but I wouldn't want to see them, and certainly not for $[...] plus parking.

Of course, I'm speaking of Paycheck, the most recent title to shatter my hopes of a good science fiction film.

The problem with John Woo is that he's so...John Woo. Exactly the same can be said of watching Ben Affleck. In fact, Philip K. Dick is the only one of these three collaborators who cannot really be blamed for the atrocious excesses of this project, mostly because he's dead.

To be fair, Paycheck represents Woo at his most restrained (!). Still, it proved too much for this moviegoer. Those who were hoping for another `Minority Report' kind of experience will be sorely disappointed. Paycheck contains far too many cringe-inducing moments to match the intelligence of that other project by Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise.

While trying to ignore some of the poor dialogue in this film it became apparent to me that the myriad problems in Paycheck began with the screenplay. Granted, our old paranoid friend Philip-K is not an easy man to comprehend or transcribe. Yet other filmmakers, few though they are, have proven that Dick's insanely acquired taste in storytelling can be successfully adapted to the screen without any necessity to dumb them down, though it is sometimes wise to expand the action sequences. In this task John ""over-the-top"" Woo proved to be somewhat overqualified, to the detriment of this film.

The spirit of the original short story is here, but it's buried under a mountain of slickness and the mood has been shifted to a kind of casual, playful smugness. Philip-K would most likely be horrified at the sight and sound of it all.",1073001600,,2121,4.91340782122905

2019112,4,B0001NBNF2,"Paycheck, the new sci-fi action thriller from John Woo delivers some great action and entertains on a high scale.  Ben Affleck is better, (eagerly trying to redeem himself after the huge debacle of Gigli).  Uma Thurman does just fine and Joe Morton and Paul Giamatti shine.
  Now the premise of this film might throw you off, but it shouldn't.  Knowing that this film is based on the work of Philip K. Dick who wrote Blade Runner, Minority Report and Total Recall you can expect something new.  The film while similar to The Bourne Identity definetly has its differences.  In fact, Matt Damon was originally offered the lead role in Paycheck but he declined because he said it was too similar to his role in The Bourne Identity.
  Essentially, Affleck plays Mike Jennings, a big computer engineer.  His clever mind has enabled him to make a new program.  Mike is soon offered a huge job offer by his good friend Jimmy Rethrick (Aaron Eckhart).  After he's done the job he gets a huge paycheck, hence the title of the film.  But his memory but be erased, and so he'll have no recollection of what his job was, since it is very secretive and confidential.  After his memory is erased he soon learns he has a girlfriend, played by Uma Thurman.  She along with his good friend Shorty played nicely by Paul Giamatti are the only ones he can trust.
  Though the movie isn't as predictable as it may seem, it does build up with some suspense.  And as I stated earlier it delivers with the typical action of a John Woo flick.  From here we get a great BMW motorcycle chase, (similar to M:I-2, though it's hard to say which was better) along with some other action sequences.
  Paycheck is rated PG-13 for Intense Action Violence and Brief Language.  The violences includes mainly gunplay, fistfights and explosions.  Language is extremely mild.  There's
also some sexual innuendo, but not explicit.  All in all, a good movie to see over the holiday.  Worth viewing in theatres and possibly owning on video or DVD.",1072742400,22,2005,4.6571428571428575

Paycheck stars our favorite stick of wood who is remarkably un-wooden in his role as Michael Jennings; computer whiz and guru in the art of reverse engineering.  Corporate espionage is a dirty business, so Mr. Jennings has to have his memory erased every time he does his job.  This tends to be a tricky and somewhat dangerous way to earn a living, but he can't turn down an offer in the range of eight figures (plus stock options) in exchange for two years of his life spent developing a very special machine.
There's just one problem.  After the job is done, he awakens to find he has signed away his entire fortune in exchange for about 20 household items such as a paperclip and a can of hairspray.  It's tough enough to prove you've been swindled when your memory has been erased.  It's worse yet, when people are trying to kill you.
People said 2003 would be the year of The Matrix.  It's more like the year of Uma Thurman.  Fresh off the set of Kill Bill, her alien features complement the futuristic role as ""the love interest.""  There's no chemistry between them, but it's not surprising since she stomachs the worst pick-up lines since Affleck did Pearl Harbor.
Plot holes are prevalent, such as breaking into Big Scary Corp. to destroy the evil machine only to use it again for some illogical reason.  Hollywood has churned out so much implausible garbage that I'm not even affected.  My main disappointment was with the only director that I never imagined could make an ultimately boring movie.  There's none of John Woo's signature style, save for a ""dove through the doorway"" sequence.  I yawned through the motorcycle chase.  He even resorts to amateurish camera shakes to create the illusion something exciting is happening.  The story has been done before, from the philosophical future-think paranoia of Spielberg's Minority Report, to the heavy-handed action of Verhoeven's Total Recall.  John Woo takes a lot from both and ends up with a lot of neither.

Who would have guessed?
I was expecting a taut psychological thriller with some action similar to Total Recall or Imposter ( other Phillip K. Dick adaptations) but what we get is a typical Woo. Set up a mysterious and intriguing scenario. sprinkle it with suspense and uncertaintly and begin an almost Hitchcock-ian style premise - then develop none of it.
Guns, bombs and car crashes are substituted for plot points. The biggest concern I had for the hero was that all those flying bullets might muss up his hair requiring him to take a time out for the ""Queer Eye"" guys to touch up his looks.
It was okay as an action movie, but it missed so many opportunities to tease the audience like Verhooven did with Total Recall.

2019116,3,B0001NBNF2,"A lot of people will probably complain that PAYCHECK is nothing but a cheap copy of MINORITY REPORT.  While the two films do share quite a few similarities, the fact remains that all of Phillip K. Dick's stories share similarities of some kind or other.  These do fit better on the page, though, making all of his works seem connected.  On screen, however, it more often than not just makes whatever film it is (in this case, PAYCHECK) seem like a rip-off.
Not to say that PAYCHECK is a bad movie.  Far from it!  It's actually very entertaining at times.  Other times, however, it's kinda boring and uninvolving.  (Then again, whatever plot or romance John Woo tries to squeeze into his films is always sub-par.)  And like I said, it's no MINORITY REPORT (masterpiece!), but it doesn't try to be.  Rather, it tries to be a harmless way to spend a few bucks at the movies, at which it succeeds.
I don't know what so many people have against Ben Affleck lately.  I for one like him; the problem is that he's miscast quite often.  But not so much here, even if he doesn't exactly garner Oscar attention.  Aaron Eckhart was pretty good, but I just couldn't quite stomach him as a bad guy.  And I must say, Uma Thurman is gonna have a really hard time in movies for a while, after KILL BILL and all (another case of pigeon-hole).  I did like Paul Giomatti, however (sorry if I spelt his name wrong), who was very good in a supporting role.
But acting is not what we go to see movies like this for.  The plot keeps you guessing, though things weren't as mysterious as I would have hoped.  The action did its job, but it won't knock your socks off; all in all pretty standard fare.  When the evil device behind it all was finally revealed, I was very pleased.  Really imaginative, if you ask me.
One thing I didn't really like about the movie was that it had no style of its own.  Every futuristic movie, from BLADE RUNNER, to BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II, to MINORITY REPORT had a style of its own.  PAYCHECK doesn't (something that marred THE 6TH DAY, as well).  But I shouldn't complain if a movie doesn't try to break any ground.  After all, that's what a lot of movies these days get unfairly criticized for.  Oh, and I was also confused in that they never told you when the movie takes place.  The technology is very advanced, yet everybody is dressed, acts, and talks like modern-day people.
Complaints aside, PAYCHECK achieves its goal: to tell a harmless story that keeps you guessing and entertains you.<P...",1072483200,,2509,4.463736263736264

8015106,1,B0001NBNF2,"Only worked on my computer...was told that I didn't read the info. about the dvd. I didn't because I had already seen the movie and knew what it was about. I think that the fact that it won't play in the US should be said right after the title, not somewhere else.",1517961600,,264,4.096153846153846
8015107,5,B0001NBNF2,"Paycheck is a very good action- and suspense-filled film for viewers who like sci-fi films. It does not reveal all that is happening at the outset, but only little by little, and this is good; it adds to the suspense. The story, in short, is about an engineer who is hired for an eight figure paycheck on the condition that he work on the project for three years and agree to have his mind whipped clean at the end of the three years, erasing all that happened in the three years and all he knew about what happened. He also has to agree to give up everything he has in his possession, which is placed in an envelope with the promise that all will be returned at the close of the three years. He agrees.
At the end of the three years he is given back the envelop, but it does not contain what he placed in it, but a collection of strange objects, and he cannot understand why they are in the envelope or remember their significance. He finds out that he was paid over ninety million dollars but gave the money back to the company. He cannot understand why he would do so. Also, some one or some group is trying to kill him and the government is trying to get him to tell what he knows about the three years.",1515542400,3,1207,4.184549356223176
