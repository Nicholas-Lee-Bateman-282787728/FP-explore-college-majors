6820100,5,B00PRABXFO,"This is my second Jane Adams yoga practice dvd. I found ""Gentle Yoga:7 Beginning Yoga Practices for Mid-life"" to be my go-to-practice to compliment my water aerobics class. I work very hard not to suffer an injury and I feel very secure in recommending this dvd. Jane is very clear and precise with the movements. The scenic background and music are very relaxing while giving your body a gentle overall stretch. The 7 different practices on the dvd can be combined or done individually depending on what you want or feel like doing. This one is a winner especially for seniors who want to take care of their body as well as their emotional well- being. This is the only yoga practice that I have been able to entice my husband to do with me.",1418774400,337,742,4.503703703703704
6820101,5,B00PRABXFO,"Jane Adams makes yoga very approachable.  She understands the benefits of yoga for all ages, and takes extra special care for seniors.
I forever want Jane and her teachings in my life.",1418601600,23,184,4.75
6820102,5,B00PRABXFO,This Yoga CD is exceptional in that it has a very good selection of Yoga poses divided up into categories that give you the option of what area you would like to work on and it is in an absolutely gorgeous setting at Glacier National Park.  I have found the benefit of Yoga something I cannot do without.  Flexibility and Balance  are so important as we grow older and Yoga is a great way to develop these strengths.  This helps prevent falls and if we do fall can help us fall in a way to prevent fractures.  As a retired registered nurse I recommend this to all my friends and this CD is top of my list.,1418342400,261,605,4.136752136752137
6820103,5,B00PRABXFO,"Our genetic makeup gives us poor flexibility, so this series of yoga videos is perfect for ALL ages of our family. Jane Adams is incredibly skilled at teaching yoga in a simple, peaceful, yet very effective way. Thank you, Jane!",1533686400,,228,4.725
6820104,5,B00PRABXFO,Excellent for Seniors new to Yoga.,1533686400,,34,4.833333333333333
6820105,5,B00PRABXFO,i am a beginner and this DVD is very good at explaining everything - also very balanced with different options - Jane's voice is very soothing and encouraging and i love the music -so relaxing - since the sessions are not too long i can get in one everyday,1533686400,,256,4.244897959183674
6820106,5,B00PRABXFO,Great for beginners. Very easy to follow.,1533600000,,41,5.0
6820107,5,B00PRABXFO,Very good DVD-I am using it at work with coworkers.,1533600000,,51,4.2
6820108,5,B00PRABXFO,The video along with Jane's verbal instructions makes it easy to follow and to know that you're doing the movement correctly. I'm 61 and a beginner. I found the routines beneficial and at the perfect gradient for me.,1533513600,,216,4.7105263157894735
6820109,5,B00PRABXFO,"This is a very nice, easy to navigate, collection of gentle yoga practices.",1533513600,,75,4.846153846153846
6820110,5,B00PRABXFO,I have never done yoga before. I am 56 years old so I tried this dvd to start. Wow. Love it. Jane is great. It is very easy to follow and really makes for a great workout different from the normal which for me was treadmill and airdyne bike. I am using muscles I don't normally use. I love that.,1533513600,,295,3.933333333333333
6820111,5,B00PRABXFO,"Like this video. One woman out in nature, just what I was looking for!",1533340800,,70,4.071428571428571

6820113,5,B00PRABXFO,"I purchased this in the spring. Turned 50 this year and I have NEVER done yoga. I bought this to try to help with balance and flexibility....they seem to be disappearing. Anyway, I think this is probably a good place to start for someone like me. I am in pretty decent shape, just getting older. The DVD contains several different sections, each working on something different. The moves are gentle and slow, and they are relatively simple. I would think anyone who regularly does yoga or is younger and in better shape would prefer something more challenging.",1533254400,,560,4.783505154639175
6820114,5,B00PRABXFO,This is a wonderful introduction to yoga  We purchased to improve balance but have enjoyed all the stretches.  We love the fact that you can go directly to the program you want.  We found the morning energize section is helpful for flexibility and a perfect start to our day following the routine outside facing our beautiful lake in Maine.,1533081600,,340,4.728813559322034
6820115,5,B00PRABXFO,Love it!,1532908800,,8,3.5
6820116,5,B00PRABXFO,"I ordered this DVD for both myself and my husband - we are both desk sitters at jobs 40 hours a week, and both have some minor back issues because of it.  We have been doing 3 or 4 of these 7 workouts at least 4 times a week for the past two weeks, and I can already tell the difference.  The workouts are gentle, yet effective, and even though I have had two hip replacements, the poses are very easy and also easy to adjust if need be. Jane is an effective teacher - calm and easy to follow.  I plan on continuing these workouts for a while, and then maybe add an additional one of Jane's DVD's for some variety.",1532822400,,614,4.016393442622951
6820117,5,B00PRABXFO,Thank you so much Jane for your wonderful lesson. This is exactly what I need simple and fit on my beginner knowledge.am happy with you dvd lesson for senior like be,1532736000,,165,4.354838709677419
6820118,5,B00PRABXFO,"I have taken yoga before and know that it is a wonderful practice for everyone and especially for someone who sits at a computer all day and needs to work out some stiff and sore back muscles. I highly recommend it for the nice, slow, gentle stretches - it's perfect for easing muscle tension and making you more mindful of your posture. Her voice is soothing and the scenery and background music is calming. If you are looking for something very demanding this isn't it - but if you want a dvd that you will go back to again and again - buy this one.",1532736000,,551,4.257142857142857
6820119,4,B00PRABXFO,I really like the video. The only problem is I have to turn up the volume to the max so I can hear it.  Is this normal for this tape?,1532649600,,133,3.433333333333333
6820120,5,B00PRABXFO,A really excellent video. A good variety of programs for various parts of one's day. I like it a lot and have even recruited my reluctant husband to do some of it with me.,1532649600,,171,4.0588235294117645
6820121,5,B00PRABXFO,"When I first got this DVD I reviewed it to see if I could perform any of the poses. The DVD is nicely organized and the instructions are clear and easy to hear even though the instructor is outdoors.  I bought this DVD to do yoga at home vs going to a class for convenience reasons and this DVD does a good job for me. There are sections of options of evening relaxation, core strength, morning poses, etc. I have not done all of the workouts yet but I like the core and evening sections so far.",1532476800,,495,4.103092783505154
6820122,5,B00PRABXFO,"I use this DVD every day.  I recommend it to anyone attempting yoga for the first time.
I'm a 70 yr old woman and was worried about my lack of flexibility. It's helped me.",1532476800,,171,4.029411764705882
6820123,5,B00PRABXFO,"I'm a senior citizen and I needed something easy to get me back into the habit of exercising. I really like this DVD, which has several sessions, most of which are around 30 minutes. I like the 18-minute morning energy workout the best, but they're all good, and not extremely difficult for a clumsy old person like me. If you need something that's even a little easier/gentler, I suggest ""Balance and Strength Exercises for Seniors,"" also by Jane Adams. This is a great purchase on its own, though.",1532390400,,499,4.681818181818182
6820124,5,B00PRABXFO,"This is a very good DVD for the novice. For me, a total beginner, it offers definite challenges, but it is also provides clear instructions given in a gentle, encouraging manner. I would recommend.",1532390400,,197,4.823529411764706
6820125,5,B00PRABXFO,The best dvd I have ever done! Thank you. I recommended it to my parents also. My husband has even done a few workouts with me and he loves it too.,1532217600,,147,3.774193548387097
6820126,5,B00PRABXFO,Your gentle yoga is exactly what I need! I enjoyed every program and your gentle and thorough instructions. I will be purchasing more of your dvds. Thank you! Namaste,1532217600,,166,4.758620689655173
6820127,5,B00PRABXFO,"The veterans said that this was great to do yoga with.  They are planning on switching it up each week, so that the get new things, and possibly do the ones that already know and be able to keep them busy until their instructor returns.",1532131200,,236,4.2444444444444445
6820128,5,B00PRABXFO,"I love the time frame of each session, they fit perfectly in my schedule and if I have extra time, I can combine them for a longer session. I also like to vary my exercise programs and this dvd is wonderful for days when I need a more relaxing routine.",1532131200,,252,4.06
6820129,4,B00PRABXFO,great,1532131200,,5,5.0
6820130,5,B00PRABXFO,"Amazing! I have been having outer hip pain for years now. I walk 2 miles a day at a good clip and it has never helped my hips. Just 2 weeks (6 times of doing the floor excercise and my hip pain is virtually gone!! I didn't do it for this reason, just to get more flexible but it worked wonders!",1532044800,2,294,3.8360655737704916
6820131,5,B00PRABXFO,"My body was stiff,after the 1st session the pain was less.",1531699200,,58,4.363636363636363
6820132,5,B00PRABXFO,My doctor suggested I try yoga to increase some flexibility. I tried yoga but found it too hard on my body. I purchased this DVD and have found it to be extremely helpful getting back into shape. I like the option to choose which practice based on my time schedule or what I want to improve. I will be purchasing more of Jane Adams' yoga  DVDs.,1531526400,,344,4.212121212121212
6820133,5,B00PRABXFO,I LOVE this DVD !!!  Beyond worth the price...Probably will be the only one I use from now on--at 79 a lot of my older DVDs are beyond my physical abilities. There are 7 different practices to choose from.  Something for everyone!,1531526400,,230,4.4523809523809526
6820134,5,B00PRABXFO,"Im 48 years old, relatively active (walks with the dog, yoga on and off, some light weights) but also a total couch potato at times and truly struggle with exercise and some yoga poses.  This  DVD is by far the best yoga one I have and I couldn't be more thrilled. The poses are smooth and not super challenging but yet I can feel it in my muscles and know what it is doing to my body. Ive worked muscles I didn't know I had!  Janes voice and talk through is exactly what I need to follow without overthinking whether or not Im doing the exercises or breathing just right. My husband (works out with weights) even enjoys it and even admitted he felt stretches he never felt before and might possibly become a convert. I cant say enough about how awesome this DVD is and I believe its the perfect fit for beginners or even intermediate yoga goers. Im excited to purchase more videos from Jane.",1531526400,5,892,4.3293413173652695
6820135,5,B00PRABXFO,Thank you so much Look forward to getting more in the fututre,1531526400,,61,4.166666666666667
6820136,5,B00PRABXFO,"As a 63 year old, I was a bit worried about trying to do yoga.  This video erased those concerns!  I love it!  The scenery is beautiful, the narrators voice is calming, and the segments leave me feeling toned AND relaxed.  A great video for any age!",1531526400,,249,4.23404255319149
6820137,5,B00PRABXFO,My father had open heart surgery almost a year ago. A couple of months ago he bought this DVD to try to loosen his muscles & strengthen them again. I bought it from his recommendation & enjoy it. Ive never done yoga before & am out of shape. I definitely recommend this if you're a beginner.,1531440000,,291,4.214285714285714
6820138,4,B00PRABXFO,"This DVD is very useful for helping to improve balance, flexibility and strength for older sedentary people seeking self improvement.",1531440000,,133,5.7
6820139,5,B00PRABXFO,"An exceptional aid to someone who wants to slowly enter the waters of yoga.  At 69 years of age and suffering from sciatica, I purchased this DVD hoping it would help me find relief without medication.  Quite simply, the poses in the very first portion of the DVD helped relieve the sciatica completely.  Gone.  And not even one of those poses was difficult or painful.  Just helpful.  Peaceful and a little addictive.  My only wish is that there were an accompanying CD that I could download onto my smartphone so I could have these guided sessions with me wherever I go.  I can't recommend this DVD enough.  Excellent.  Extraordinarily helpful and beneficial.  And very easy.",1531440000,,677,4.8
6820140,5,B00PRABXFO,"I've bought a few yoga and Pilate DVD's, but I especially like this one by Jane Adams.  It's gentle, but not clinical!  I was experiencing lower back pain that seemed to be aggravated by my following a  beautiful pilates video that was probably too hard for me, so I ordered an expensive one done by a doctor that wasn't any fun at all.  Jane's DVD seems to strike a great balance: it's beautiful, gentle, interesting and very helpful!",1531440000,2,435,4.538461538461538
6820141,5,B00PRABXFO,"I love this DVD. I am 63 years old, never done Yoga and have a sitting job... These yoga exercises help me to become more flexible, I am pretty stiff from sitting at the computer for 30 years. I enjoy Jane's voice and instructions, she is making it so easy to follow. I am looking forward every day to do some of the 7 practices. Thank you Jane, this DVD is just what I was looking for.",1531353600,,386,4.025974025974026
6820142,5,B00PRABXFO,"It is a great yoga video.  The instructions are easy to follow, and you can tell that Jane has lots of experience because she includes comments for you to check and make sure you are doing the postures correctly.  I used the video with 3 friends, and they also thought it was very well done.  I have other yoga videos from other instructors, but I prefer this one because of the pace and the variety of postures that work on all areas of your body.",1531353600,,448,4.247058823529412
6820143,5,B00PRABXFO,Excellent video. Easy to follow along and adjusts to different skill levels seamlessly.,1531353600,,87,5.769230769230769

6820146,5,B00PRABXFO,Great for beginners and challenging enough for intermediate yoga practice too.,1530835200,,78,6.181818181818182
6820147,5,B00PRABXFO,I'm so glad I purchased this DVD.  It is doable and is making a difference in balance issues.  It is easy to follow and she  doesn't stay on one exercise for an endless amount of time.,1530576000,,184,4.055555555555555
6820148,5,B00PRABXFO,Perfect Balance of Yoga work outs - from easy stretches to more difficult moves.  Love it!  Great for someone just starting.,1530403200,,124,4.857142857142857
6820149,5,B00PRABXFO,Love it!  It's the perfect Yoga video for the beginner and especially for the 55+ demographic.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1530403200,,124,4.857142857142857
6820150,5,B00PRABXFO,Very easy for me to pick and choose what workout I want to do. I am 55+ and this is a very gentle way to do yoga.,1530316800,,113,3.2222222222222223

6820153,5,B00PRABXFO,"Very pleased with the  DVD.  I like the variation of difficulty so that I can use it as my body allows.  Helps with arthritis pain.  Also like the mirror image,  much easier to follow, and that there is no loud background music.  For anyone with hearing difficulty, that is a problem.  Thank you for this wonderful Yoga DVD.",1530144000,,324,4.482758620689655

6820156,5,B00PRABXFO,"We love it.  Not too difficult, yet takes you through great series of flows to address specific issues.  Excellent dvd.",1529884800,2,119,4.9
6820157,5,B00PRABXFO,"The part of the CD that I needed the most was defective.  Evening Practice just freezes on the title screen.  Relaxation has the Evening Practice title screen and is frozen.  They will not play forward and the music is gone.
I was sent a replacement CD.  The relaxing music and gentle directions  given by Jane are just what I needed!",1529884800,,334,4.5
6820158,5,B00PRABXFO,Perfect for me!  Gently challenging without straining.  Given options during each session to make it less challenging or more challenging.  Her voice is soothing and she speaks slowly so you can actually follow what she is saying and therefore able to keep up.,1529884800,,260,5.0
6820159,5,B00PRABXFO,"As with the other Jane Adams video I purchased (Balance & Strength), this video also provides muscle stamina.  It takes you through Yoga moves very slowly and every move is very thoroughly explained as you go into the move.  I have done Yoga before, but it hasn't been my best workout.  This one, however, seems to make me want to do these poses.  Excellent step by step explanations as you go through these moves.  Love it too!",1529798400,,428,4.5064935064935066
6820160,4,B00PRABXFO,"Very helpful!  I got it to help with movement, flexibility from a sedentary desk job as well as strengthening for my aging body. I have some experience with yoga so I knew what to expect. I have not gone through all of the categories but what I have, the pace was just right for me, and if I needed to focus on an area a bit more I just hit pause to do a few more of that particular pose. I find the variety of workouts very convenient, thanks also to the way DVD's work.  As for the level of difficulty, I have not found any yet that are way too hard for me and I know the rule is always to do what my body can at the time. I have found continued practice improves my ability and decreases my pain, hence I know it is working!  The only things I would like to have seen more of was coaching on when/how to breathe within some of the poses.",1529625600,,840,3.929411764705882
6820161,5,B00PRABXFO,"This is a great DVD.  I am 56 and have done Yoga over the years, but had been out of it for a number of years.  I love the various options this DVD offers.  You can combine routines or focus on specific areas you need strength building on.  Allows flexibility with your comfort level.",1529452800,,284,4.203703703703703
6820162,5,B00PRABXFO,"I am 64 years old and have very bad knees elbows and shoulder joints so I was looking for a yoga  program that would help me be a little bit more pain free and more flexible without being too difficult. I love this program within just a week of using it I'm feeling so much better. Although I have only used one of the workouts I sense that some of the other workouts are more difficult as there are seven different ones on this DVD but that gives me something to look forward to that I can work into in the future that will give me a more advanced Workout as I get more experience, and get in better shape. Obviously I'm very happy with this DVD.",1529452800,,647,4.094488188976378
6820163,5,B00PRABXFO,"Great routines, lovely presentation that's easy to follow.  Jane Adams is a lovely instructor.  Even her voice is soothing, a nice addition to her routines.

6820164,1,B00PRABXFO,"Threw away this video due to the Holy Spirit's conviction that the ""spiritual"" meditation at the end of some practices clearly contradict the teaching of God's word in the Holy Bible.",1529280000,,183,4.935483870967742
6820165,5,B00PRABXFO,"Well balanced workouts are easy to follow. There is enough variety between the workouts that, by choosing a different one each day, I'm not overworking any particular muscle groups.  In days when time is tight, or I'm feeling less motivated, I keep the habit going by doing one of the shorter workouts. There's a workout that's fine entirely lying down. Great for keeping muscles flexible when I don't feel like getting up.",1529107200,,423,4.875

6820167,4,B00PRABXFO,I think this is great but I hurt my neck I guess I try to stretch to much. I feel Im tensing up during most of the stretches and for many of the bending at the waist exercises it hurts my upper stomach and feel like I cant breath with my head bent forward. Yes my belly is not flat Im guessing thats the propblem,1528848000,,312,3.8153846153846156

6820173,5,B00PRABXFO,"Im an active 72 yr old female who had never done yoga before. After having some minor low back pain and stiffness from lifting grandchildren I decided to try gentle stretching exercise and found this video. It was very easy to follow the instructor and the setting was beautiful. The narration is also relaxing. After a week the back pain was gone probably on its own or possibly from the gentle exercise. In any case, I will continue parts of this video in my morning and evening exercise routine as I do notice increased flexibility in my lower spine.",1528502400,2,553,4.595959595959596

6820177,5,B00PRABXFO,"This the very best gentle yoga I have ever experienced.  Jane is thoughtful in her instruction and helps move me to a greater flexibility each time I do the work. The variety of work-outs provided are fun and specific to certain issues I may be having.  I am a 68 year old woman and I find this very appropriate to my age with the added challenge of a more difficult work out if desired.  Buy this for anyone you care about, it is amazing!",1528329600,2,439,4.2023809523809526

6820179,5,B00PRABXFO,"I am active 72 yr old woman and have been doing some yoga in past. I never was an expert  and have managed to upset my sciatic nerve. (never had any training and I try to do the moves apparently over the top). Went through a lot of treatments/pills which did not help much. This was going on for a years but eventually I got better. Since I tried different CD's tried and was more careful but always ended with some kind of pain. I like this CD especially the morning stretches and the balance exercises since I am having some problem with that with balance. It's a great place to start if you have any issues hip,back pain, sciatica or any spine, or balance issues. In all honesty I have not tried all of the exercises but picked the ones I felt i need the most but hope to do more.",1528243200,2,783,4.151315789473684

6820184,5,B00PRABXFO,"I have purchased many yoga dvds only to find they were too hard or too repetitive for my aging body.  This dvd is perfect for my 60+, less flexible body. Jane goes slow with her positions and tells you exactly how to position yourself. This is a plus when you're lying on the floor and don't want to keep raising your head to look at the tv to see how to do it. I love how flexible Ive become in just a few weeks of doing these moves. There are 10 different practices to do so youll never get bored. I am finding that Im sleeping better since doing her dvd.

6820185,5,B00PRABXFO,"I have had this dvd for several weeks and have been trying to use it nearly every day. I'm 67 years old, still working, and walking up to 2 miles a day, but not in the shape I would like!  So far I've been focusing on the 18 minute session for energizing the day. I've found it to be a good start for my day as it gives me some good stretches, a few balance exercises, and some that seem to be strengthening my core. I really do feel it energizes me--even more so than my daily walk with the dog!  It's a bonus to gaze at beautiful mountain scenery!  I've also tried the first one, which involves floor exercises, and another working on balance, and found them to be good, but the longer time, plus time to spread the mat and/or get out a chair, is a little more than I can fit into most work-day mornings.  Those will be used for days off!
I've been thinking of getting a dvd for my friend, but worry that it might be too challenging since she has more physical challenges, especially with balance.  Is there another program for someone like her?.",1528070400,,1048,4.22

The down ward dog, and some other moves were too much for this beginner  I was not as limber as i thought I was. I did get a little frustrated  Then I found Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams oh my I love yoga now. Jane goes over the moves so you know what to do , and I can do them. I look forward every day to doing my yoga.  I recommend this video to any one wanting to learn yoga or just need a more gentle work out.

I appreciate that we are given ways to vary the poses to fit our physical needs.

6820207,5,B00PRABXFO,"She is a great instructor. Then thing I really like about the video is that, unlike so many exercise videos where they yammer on to fill the gaps while they exercise, this is purely demonstrating the techniques with a calm and to the point narrative done as a voice-over.

6820209,5,B00PRABXFO,"This is my favorite yoga video ever!.  I am in my late forties and since I haven't practiced yoga since the late nineties, I consider myself a beginner.  It seems to me that most yoga videos are more aerobics than actual yoga and do not leave me calm, flexible or clear-headed.  They also force you to do one pose after the other without time to feel the stretch at all.  What I like about this video is that it is slow-moving and even though the poses are simple, I can actually feel myself become more flexible and more aware of my breath, which I didn't experience with the ""power yoga"" videos.  Also, with the other videos, it seems like they are saturated with downward and upward dog poses and complicated floor poses that force you to look up from what you are doing to watch the teacher.  This video doesn't have any of that and includes a lot more poses using your arms, which I like.  There are also many different options you can choose from, not just am and pm yoga.  I very much recommend this video!",1526342400,,1013,4.351063829787234

I have 2 artificial knees and for the very few that have kneeling involved, I use a pillow and it's pretty much OK.

For the first time, I actually look forward to my beginning Yoga routine.  The Morning Energy and Lying Practice are my favorite go to's for the moment. I am looking forward to expanding my ability and agility with Jane.  Thank you so much Ms. Jane for helping me to improve my health and exercise routine.

6820260,5,B00PRABXFO,"i loved the calm and tranquil  setting.  jane's guiding narrative is instructive without being intrusive.  the yoga is deceptively easy and surprisingly effective.  the dvd is divided into segments, making it easy to fit into daily life.  good for beginners and beyond!",1522713600,,269,5.309523809523809
6820261,5,B00PRABXFO,"This a great program for gentle yoga stretching and relaxing or morning energy and stretching after sitting in an office chair for 8-10 hours. Highly recommend, nothing that anyone can't do, no tricky poses or anything like that, gently and easy (not that you don't feel it and may need to progress slowly, but doable)! Highly recommend for anyone that's been away from exercise or is older.",1522540800,,391,4.850746268656716
6820262,5,B00PRABXFO,Jane Adams is a great instructor and the dvd is a good tool for someone who is starting out like me at age 65.  Take it slowly as she cautions and built yourself up.  The background music and scenery are very pleasant and peaceful.,1522454400,,231,4.2272727272727275
6820263,4,B00PRABXFO,"Slow, concise, easy to follow.  Perhaps, for me, a bit too slow. For those of you who know Millionaire Hoy, the exercise/yoga guru on YouTube, HE is how I got started with yoga. So I am used to a slightly faster pace:)  Having said that, Jane makes it immensely easy to learn yoga and I do enjoy the gentle workouts.  But I need that weekly 'fist bump' from the Millionaire, ya know? :)",1522368000,,386,4.260273972602739

6820265,5,B00PRABXFO,"This DVD excellent for beginners over 50.  Jane instructed not only the pose itself and giving the proper name, but instructed on breathing techniques and what parts of the body should be doing what, including where feet and hands should be placed.  I first watched the DVD to see what she was doing and then went through it again.  She's calm, quiet, and knowledgeable and seemed to understand that beginners, especially those over 50 (60 in my case) need to learn flexibility at a slower pace.  I loved it being filmed outdoors (and it truly was outdoors when the ant crawled onto her foot and she gently brushed it off).  Highly recommend.",1522195200,,642,4.696428571428571
6820266,5,B00PRABXFO,"I am 55 years old with Rheumatoid arthritis and this helps to keep me limber. I also had both knees replaced and if I can do the moves here, anyone can. The Only ones I cannot do are anything involving getting on my knees, but those moves can be modified using a straight back chair. There are seven different sessions on this DVD, so you can vary up your routine depending on if you want a more gentle routine or a more vigorous one.",1522195200,,434,4.178571428571429

6820268,5,B00PRABXFO,"This was the perfect DVD to get started with. Easy to follow--not too fast and not too slow. And yet it challenges me. There are still some poses that I can't do quite yet, but I'm getting there.",1522108800,,195,4.157894736842105

6820270,4,B00PRABXFO,"Her office routine and morning routine are wonderful.  They are not too complicated or hard for a beginner like me, and yet I could feel the movements were helping me to stretch and relax some very tight muscle groups.  I would recommend especially for a beginner like me.",1522022400,,272,4.645833333333333

6820276,4,B00PRABXFO,"This was exactly what I was needing!  Thanks so much!  My only problem is that the table of contents to select which workout I want to do is located in the middle of the CD, causing me to have to fast forward through the intro and the beginning instructions (which are great, I just don't want to repeat them daily) in order to get started.  I would love it if there were an option to go straight to the list of workouts near the beginning of the CD.",1521590400,,450,4.090909090909091
6820277,5,B00PRABXFO,This earns my highest rating and was perfect for my needs. I went on to order Jane's next DVD although it will be a while before I am ready. The practices are excellent but equally important easy to follow. Unique and so helpful is that Jane demonstrates but does not speak directly on the video but rather talks over it. It is easier and quite relaxing. Highly recommended. Thank you Jane Adams.,1521590400,,396,4.513888888888889

6820282,5,B00PRABXFO,"This dvd is truly a gentle yoga practice, but works all parts of the body, with some great stretches I have not done to the extent she has one perform.  There are 7 practices, the longest being 34 minutes, and shortest 18 minutes, plus an 8 minutes relaxation.  She gives excellent instruction, Im 68 and just having two hip replacement, the practices are benificial to my recovery.  I would highly recommend this dvd if you are looking for easy to understand and gentle yoga practices.

6820346,5,B00PRABXFO,She demonstrates alternate positions for those of us who cannot quite reach the poses she demonstrates.  I like that she doesn't focus so much on breathing-I know that is a big part of yoga but for me it is distracting when someone is constantly telling me how to breathe.  I am recovering from a leg fracture and this video is helping me regain some strength and balance.  Also I like that the setting is outdoors and not in a studio-I have been to this national park and this video brings back good memories.  I am happy with this purchase.,1518825600,,542,4.444444444444445

6820359,5,B00PRABXFO,"I love this DVD!  I had seen some reviews that noted problems with it playing on their devices, not liking the sound, and not being able to fast forward or reverse it.  I didn't experience any of that.  I think it is a remarkable DVD!  I love the sound, the background where it was recorded and Ms. Adams instructions are perfect.  I've practiced yoga on and off throughout the years and had recently taken a class with a local instructor.  Unfortunately, she only offered those classes once per week.  I wanted something I could use everyday and my instructor recommended any of Jane Adam's DVD's.  I'm glad she did.  I lost my hearing in my left ear eleven years ago, sudden deafness they called it.  I've had balance issues since.  I really believe utilizing this DVD will help with those issues and strengthen my core.  Approximately a week after I received my order, I got an email from Ms. Adams, explaining that she is a small business owner and that she wanted to follow up to verify I had received the order, that I was pleased with it and if there were any quality issues she offered ways to replace or resolve any issues.  So, I can't imagine having better customer service than that!

6820362,5,B00PRABXFO,"I have really enjoyed this DVD. It is ""gentle"" as the title indicates, but surprisingly there are certain practices that I find challenging. One of those is the ""Improving Balance"" segment. I've been doing various yoga DVDs for a couple of years now and have found that my balance and flexibility has improved tremendously. However, Jane's practice on balance had me wobbling all over the place! I also love the setting of the mountains and lake. On one segment, someone in a kayak paddles far in the background; eventually the ripples from the kayak reach the shore. Beautiful.",1518307200,,578,4.908163265306122

I have had multiple injuries and was looking for yoga that would be easy on my body but still help me increase flexibility and strength.

And each session has a different focus depending on whether I want to just stretch, or do more involved yoga. Just what I have been looking for. Thank you Jane. BTW...I am 65, in excellent condition but have had some injuries so need to move a bit slower and be careful. From reading other people's reviews before purchase, I sometimes wondered if the person saying it was too slow was 20 or 60. So that's why I am saying my age and condition so you can get perspective.

Also, the programs have you either standing or lying down; so no moving from floor to standing and back. I love the length of the programs (18 - 34 minutes), I can do them BEFORE work each day; I work thru the programs, 1-a-day, for the week.  Prior to Jane Adams yoga, I was seeing the chiropractor 3 -4 times a month; now I go once every 2 months.

As a senior, I have taken gentle yoga for a few years now and found that Jane's presentation meshed perfectly with what I have been taught. I would recommend this DVD to just about anyone except a person who struggles with several physical limitations. If that is your situation, I would scale the yoga practice down with a different DVD.Generally, I work with the section that deals with the core and balance but have tried some of the other sections  and found they all do what they claim.

I'm a yoga teacher, and I like to have routines of various lengths for my home practice.  Also, I prefer slower, more gentle yoga, especially because I teach mainly beginners.  I saw that my library system had this DVD, so I was glad for the opportunity to test it out before buying.

As the subtitle suggests, this DVD has seven different yoga routines.  All feature instructor Jane Adams teaching alone via voiceover in various outdoor settings.  The routines require a yoga mat, and some require additional props, including a blanket, strap, and chair.  Adams begins the DVD with a short ""Introduction and Guidelines"" section in which she offers tips for practice.  The rest of the Menu Main appears as follows:
->Lying Full Body Practice - 14 Minutes
->Morning Energy Practice - 18 Minutes
->Desk and Computer Work Relief - 19 Minutes
->Improving Balance - 22 Minutes***
->Standing Poses, Flow and Traditional - 22 Minutes***
->Core Strength and Flexibility - 34 Minutes***
->Evening Relaxing Practice - 29 Minutes
->Relaxation - 8 Minutes
*Credits

***Adams terms these ""stronger"" practices in her introduction.

I have provided an overview of each practice segment below.

LYING FULL BODY PRACTICE
This entire routine is performed lying on the back, so it is fairly accessible, although there is some core work that offers a bit of a challenge.  The moves include alternate knee ins, windshield wipers, arm/shoulder stretches, single leg lowers, flowing twist, side leg lifts, pelvic tilts, knee hovers, flowing bridge, open v-legs flow, reclining leg stretch, reclined bound angle, and a brief rest to finish.

MORNING ENERGY PRACTICE
This section does not use any props, and it is done entirely standing.  Adams starts standing for a breath focus.  She moves into a standing twist, alternating heel raises, chair flow, backstroke arms, hip circles, and heel lifts. Adams continues with standing cat/cow, upward salute/rag doll, flowing goddess squat, lateral stretch, leg lifts front/back and side-to-side, and concludes with rag doll with intention setting.

DESK AND COMPUTER WORK RELIEF
Being someone who commutes a total of 90 minutes/day and who has a mostly seated job, I had high hopes for this practice.  Adams starts seated with a jaw and temple massage followed by shoulder rolls.  Coming to standing, she performs circle breaths, goal post arms, standing side bend, and finger/wrist stretches.  Adams returns to seated for a for a twist, Figure 4 forward bend (aka head-to-knee pose), backbend, and wide-legged seated forward bend.  She then stands again for a heel to glutes stretch, warrior 1 variation, downward dog with hands on a chair, and half standing forward bend with hands on the chair.  She concludes seated.  This was a nice practice, but it didn't have as much neck/shoulder release as I would like--personally, that is my main area that gets tight from too much sitting.

IMPROVING BALANCE
This section uses an optional chair, although Adams does not use the chair for the majority of the routine.  She starts in mountain pose, shifting forward/back.  She shifts the feet side to side, forward/back, and lifts one foot for ankle circles.  This is followed by slow balance (high-knee) walks.  Next, balance one leg front/side/back, then flow; remain in one leg balance for internal/external rotation, and then a standing twist on the toes.  Adams staggers her feet for rocking and twisting.  She uses a chair for one leg hip circles, knee opens, and both tree and dancer's poses.  Removing the chair, Adams concludes with eagle pose, modified warrior 3, and ""pretending to put on socks.""  Although this practice was pretty basic, I did like it, as it had a lot of variety and it gave me ideas to incorporate into my yoga teaching.

STANDING POSES, FLOW AND TRADITIONAL
This routine also uses a chair.  Adams opens with mountain, upward salute, a chair sequence, goddess pose with flow, and chair/twist/forward bend sequence.  Adams uses the chair for two sequences: 1) forward bend, warrior 1 variation, downward dog, plank, and 2) forward bend, pyramid, downward dog, plank.  Without the chair, Adams performs warrior 2, triangle, and wide-legged forward bend to finish.

CORE STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY
Adams uses a blanket in this segment.  She starts on all-fours for cat/cow with variations, then continues seated for staff pose with twist, heart opener, boat, cobbler's pose, and seated wide-legged pose with a ""stir"" movement.  Coming to prone (lying face-down), Adams performs low cobra, locust, child's pose, high cobra, forearm plank, and crocodile pose.  A lunge series follows, including low lunge with twist, lizard pose, and downward dog, finishing with resting in child's pose.  Coming to tall knees, Adams does a half-camel with a twist.  Adams concludes this practice lying on her back for bridge with one-leg variations, leg lowers, reclined bound angle with a pelvic tilt, pelvic massage, and a brief relaxation.  This was both the longest and probably the most challenging routine.

EVENING RELAXING PRACTICE
This last routine uses a chair, a strap, and a blanket.  Adams begins using the chair for a downward dog variation, wide-legged forward bend, and one-legged forward bend (foot on chair).  Seated on the chair, she performs a twist, shoulder rolls, cat pose, eagle arms, a neck stretch series, and wide-legged seated forward bend.  She then comes to seated on the mat for head-to-knee pose, wide-legged seated forward bend, and cobbler's pose with forward bend.  She finishes the practice lying, using a strap for a hamstring stretch and then continuing with reclined Figure 4 stretch, a one-leg twist, wind relieving pose, and a very brief relaxation (Adams states ""say as long as you like"").

RELAXATION
For this separately chaptered relaxation, Adams offers a blanket under the knees as an option.  She cues through about the first half of the practice and then allows silence (with music) for the second half.

Overall, these practices were generally well done and include mirrored cueing by Adams.  The routines would be fairly accessible to most, although I would not recommend the DVD for brand-new beginners.  One of the main reasons for this is that she suggests NO modifications, even for more challenging moves such as eagle arms.  In the end, trying this DVD made me decide NOT to buy it.  The practices were nice enough, but not at all new or different from what I already own or even what is available for free online.",1517097600,2,6584,5.098039215686274

6820396,3,B00PRABXFO,"If this is ""gentle"" yoga, then I am doomed!  I bought it assuming ""gentle"" and ""beginning"" would fit me since I'm over 50 and have never tried yoga before.  My doctor suggested yoga so I thought, why not.....hahahahaha!  Let's just say I've aced the lying down on the mat and relaxing part but the rest of it needs a lot of work.  I do NOT bend that way and if I did, I would not need this video or yoga.  Fifteen min. in she had me laughing so hard I couldn't go on.  If I lifted my leg like she asked, I would seriously need a medic!  If you've done yoga before and are athletic or exercise daily then I'd say this is for you.  I walk 2-3 miles a day but that's it for exercise and apparently this gentle yoga is too much for me.  I'm no quitter, I'll keep trying but I'm pretty sure I'll end up breaking something and they'll just have to shoot me!",1516838400,24,851,4.017857142857143

6820408,5,B00PRABXFO,"I bought this DVD after buying and enjoying Jane's tai chi video at Glacier National Park. I loved the setting! I committed to learning the intricacies of tai chi in eight months and yoga in a lifetime (I'm 55). For one, I like the way she is both the narrator and the ""actor"" in the video. She has a comforting voice encouraging progress but not perfection for the beginner. A chair is a prop used at least half the time and there is no shame in it at all. I am as flexible as a lead pipe but already feel hopeful that someday I will be able to reach the heights and depths that she does after all her years of practice if I am diligent. The workout becomes more intense about halfway through and gets into what I think of as real yoga poses but I am not discouraged to keep trying. The sections on balance, which I thought would be easier, are a real challenge! I don't want to be like so many older people I see, dependent on others, on canes, and on wheelchairs because of my own self neglect, so I am willing to put in the work now. I am so glad there is a a DVD available for me to do this in my own home at my own pace. I believe that following the balance and yoga programs will help to make me fit and keep me on my own two feet for years to come.",1515715200,10,1256,3.9683794466403164

I have been doing yoga for about 5 years and found the routines to be beneficial.  I love the way Jane introduces and explains the movements before doing them.  This allows a person to review the upcoming movement sequence before actually doing it.  Another feature that I like is that Jane has  different routines addressing different areas of the body.  For busy individuals it is nice to have great routines within reasonable timeframes.  Whether this DVD is your introduction to yoga, or used as a warm up for more advanced practitioners, it is well worth it.  I have purchased several for my friends.

I appreciate Jane's very clear explanation of the correct form for each pose.  I like how the 7 practices are focused on different needs, different times of day, as well as varying levels of physical ability.  I was shopping for one DVD for myself right now, and I could not be more satisfied with this as the one!

A few months later, not willing to say goodbye to yoga, I decided to order this gentler version of yoga exercise.  I absolutely love all the routines Jane Adams presents on this DVD!!  It has only helped me and I now feel I""m back to where I started with loving yoga. These exercises are helpful and beneficial to me and I feel great again following the exercises.

I manage to fit cardio into my schedule about 4 to 5 days a week however my doctor advised I try Yoga to help me sleep better, unwind, stretch properly and the biggest thing to help with my breathing.  I am typically a hyper person and sometimes become anxious when stressed.  She wanted me to find something for beginners and also that offered some variety for me.  I went on Amazon, saw this DVD set, read the reviews and decided it was time to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did.  I have been doing it about 4 days a week for the last 3 weeks.  I am starting to feel the benefits, I feel like I am stretching muscles that have been just so tense for so long.  I am sleeping better and even on the days that I do not do one of the workouts, I tend to take a few minutes and do a few of the moves to release some tension and stress.  Total thumbs up!",1509494400,5,998,3.843137254901961

6820486,5,B00PRABXFO,This video has been a game changer. My husband and I have been using this video almost everyday since it arrived and we are both enjoying it so much and we both feel great.  Each time we are getting more and more flexible and gaining more and more control. I feel toned and strong. My husband was considering surgery for his stiff arm and shoulder but since we have been following the video his problems in this area have miraculously vanished. We love the beautiful outdoor scenes. I have never been a lover of exercise but the yoga in this video I can do and more importantly I don't have to drive to a studio and a class. Highly recommend!,1509321600,,642,4.35

6820489,1,B00PRABXFO,I was very disappointed in this disc. While the exercises shown are useful for balance and general stretching--they are not by any stretch of the imagination a yoga session. Very few traditional yoga poses were used in the demonstrations. Should not be advertised as a yoga program.,1509062400,4,282,5.0212765957446805
6820490,5,B00PRABXFO,"The episode for chair stretches/poses at work is awesome!  It was just what I was looking for:  1) not too long (19 minutes), 2) simple enough to do right in my office, 3) slow paced enough to find it relaxing, and 4) amazing results.  All those stretches and poses immediately released the tension in my neck and shoulders, and the reminders to focus on breathing with the movements are perfect.  I really love that she uses voice over and only speaks necessary instructions with a gentle, light musical background.  Too many yoga videos are ruined by the instructors talking too much unnecessarily, which really detracts from my relaxation.  This video is great, and I highly recommend it.  I hope to find time daily to squeeze it in and make it a routine on my lunch break.",1508976000,,776,4.661764705882353

Before my surgery, I bought this DVD and it was fanatastic. I helped me stay as flexible as possible before surgery. After surgery, I continued with modifications and then after 3 weeks all restrictions were lifted and I follow the exercises in the video as best I can. It is important to note, I had an ANTERIOR hip replacement which has different restrictions than the more common posterior approach. Up to surgery, I also continued to walk as best I could and to do weight bearing exercises. I am ever so grateful for the DVD and Jane Adams.",1508976000,,691,4.40625

I very much enjoy / appreciate this DVD, which helps me look forward to using it as opposed to dreading exercising. I need daily stretching & gentle muscle challenge to remain mobile & avoid surgery. This DVD is the best I've found for not only gentleness but effectiveness; it's actually more like PT rather than yoga & the stretches feel so good. Jane is down to earth & has an air of authenticity about her. Her directions are soothing without being patronizing- she understands the challenges that age & arthritis present. I also appreciate the setting in Glacier Nat'l Park, having been there many times. It's intimidating to me to watch other ""gentle yoga"" instructors i.e. on tropical islands, who are human rubber bands & whose voices (in my opinion) DO sound patronizing. (""what? you can't bend backwards & fold your legs over your ears?? tsk tsk"")  I rec this DVD to anyone who just wants to improve their strength & flexibility without all of the extraneous 'woo woo' that some yoga DVDs present.

Although I've since added other instructors to my collection, Jane is still my go-to girl for a wonderful workout.  This DVD does not disappoint, and the beautiful Montana scenery is a nice bonus.

Ive been doing yoga at home for four years, and discovered that some of the familiar poses I had been doing were easier with Janes instructions. Or maybe its just a new perspective on something familiar.  Also, the shorter sessions are really helpful;  easier to fit into my day.

She takes the time to explain how to get the most out of each movement, to not be discouraged it will take time to be able to do the practices and to remember that your balance and hip strength are two very important components to keep you from falling as you get older. There are 7 separate practices anywhere from 18 to 34 minutes and they address stress, energy, balance, strength and flexibility.  I am 61 and I have had a couple of falls recently and the last one I was laid up for a few weeks. I had lost my confidence and strength in my body and I needed to get that back. Since using Jane's yoga cd I already feel a big differenceI am gaining my confidence back and the shakiness and uncertainty are beginning to fade.

One of my in-person instructors offered Gentle Yoga; the other offered something called Fusion Flow, a cross between yoga and Pilates that sometimes was a bit too strenuous for me at this time.
In my work, I spend a great deal of time seated, and often have issues with tension in certain parts of my body. I like that there are routines on this DVD that address those issues. In fact,the variety of practices included here is remarkable! Modestly priced, filmed in a beautiful location, soothing voice, supportive teacher. Thank you, Jane, for sharing your expertise.

The video shows all the positions and moves with a voice gently and slowly giving instructions for each one. It is easy to follow and you can take it slow and do only as much as is comfortable.

I have been doing a different routine (morning and evening) every other day for a week now. I haven't found anything I am incapable of doing yet, although I do utilize a chair to help with some of the balance exercises.

It's still early days yet, but I am noticing a little relaxation in muscles that have been tense and knotted for a long time. My pain levels have dropped a bit and I am sleeping better.",1497139200,35,623,4.408695652173913

I'd lost flexibility somewhere along the way, proving the old adage that if you don't use it you lose it.  I was told that yoga would help but I do not like to attend gyms or classes.  I read the reviews for various DVD's and am so glad I chose this one out of the hordes that are available.

Jane has a soothing voice and I love that she explains everything perfectly so that even if you are closing your eyes to relax, she will let you know when she's moving onto something else.

6820647,5,B00PRABXFO,"I am VERY VERY inflexible and wanted a video to slowly get back into yoga after almost 50 yearsand this one is terrific.  The background is gorgeous, her instructions are clear and soothing, and I feel like I will improve my balance and flexibility the more I use this DVD.  It's broken down into 7 sections and an 8-minute relaxation segment; I usually do one segment and the relaxation, and feel great afterwards!  I started back with yoga taking a twice weekly class near my home, but there were so many poses I couldn't do and it became a bit frustrating. :-(
  I truly believe that Ms. Adams wants people to be satisfied with their purchase, offering an exchange or refund if not happy.  This is saving me a lot of money in live classes, and I can do as much or as little as my schedule and motivation allow in the comfort of my own home (no traveling!).

When I first looked at it, I was suspicious, it looked easy, so how could it 'do' anything?  Well, I found out!

I was delighted to find that I could do the poses/figures whatever they're called.  I was amazed to find that I really do sleep better after doing the evening relaxation routine.  While the exercises do make me aware of muscles I do not normally think I am using, I was not sore after doing the routine.  My 72 year old husband likes to do the exercises also.  Thank you for a good product.  Because I am more print oriented, it would be nice to have a printed table of contents on or in the package that matches the tracts on the video.",1492041600,,676,4.1937984496124034

6820721,5,B00PRABXFO,"I love this DVD.  At first I didn't care for Jane's voice, but she kinda grows on you, and now I equate her voice with the soothing movements that I look forward to. These are very gentle yoga movements, good for the absolute beginner (like me) and also good for those who have had injuries, or have old creaky bones and are no longer limber (like me).  I've had this DVD for a long time (at least a year) and still haven't conquered a few of the moves, just because of my own personal problems, but I keep trying.  One of these days, I'll be able to do everything!  Some of the other 'beginning yoga' DVD's that I've tried are way too advanced for me, and I simply cannot do the moves. I'm at a place in my life where I absolutely cannot twist in to a pretzel. One thing I like about Jane's coaching is that she gives you plenty of time before moving to the next move. Other trainers/coaches don't seem to do that.  The assume you are extremely limber and what - 19 or 20?  Even the ones labeled for seniors.  So I ordered this 2nd DVD for my older sister who has a multitude of health issues and bone/muscle issues, in hopes that she will come to enjoy it as I have.

Instead of proceeding to Levels 2 and 3, I purchased ""Gentle Yoga"" and ""Balance & Strength Exercises.""  All three DVDs are treasure chests for seniors seeking doable stretching and strengthening yoga exercises.  I especially enjoy the ""Morning Energy"" practice on ""Gentle Yoga.""  The opportunity to learn some simple Tai Chi exercises on ""Balance & Strength Exercises"" was a beautiful surprise. The DVDs include a number of exercise routines from which to choose the ideal one for your day. Jane Adams, a serene and talented instructor, does all the exercises herself and provides voiceover instruction. Her illustrations, both physically and verbally, make doing the exercises a pleasure. The tranquil and spectacular surroundings are inspirational.  As I select from the various exercise options, I know I am developing my strength, flexibility, and centeredness.  These are my goals.

6820738,5,B00PRABXFO,"What a wonderful teacher Jane Adams is. Her voice is beautiful, calm and measured and warm. She explains each movement and its breathing clearly and simply while doing it. The movements are straightforwardnothing exoticand even though some are challenging (like those for balance and flexibility), all are doable. Each session, or practice, is approximately 20 to 30 minutes long, which works well for anyone who is busy. Can exercise be delightful? I never thought so, but Adamss gentle instruction, the beautiful outdoor settings, and the peaceful flow of the practices have changed my mind. I look forward to doing yoga every morning now, and I miss it when I dont.

I always thought I was fairly uncoordinated, which is why I got a DVD instead of taking a class. After just a couple of weeks my confidence and strength are growing, and I think my coordination is improving, too. Eventually I may take a class, but Ill keep doing yoga at home as well, because Adams is such a fine teacher. Its inspiring to watch her, to appreciate her quiet, unassuming mastery and learn from her. I look forward to buying her other DVDs.",1487548800,6,1125,4.798969072164948

They are fairly simple, some extremely simple, even for someone who has never done a yoga pose in their life (me). The biggest problems I have are that the instructor has that sing song, yoga voice that's kind of hard (for me) to listen to, and that she doesn't come out of the TV and kick my behind to do the sets.

I selected this DVD because it is for my age group and promised to be gentle.  I confess that I am hooked on yoga!  I have not done all the sessions yet, but look forward to it.  They are challenging, but simple, which I like.  My favorite so far is the one on balancing.  I need a lot of that.  My goal is to be stronger in my core, balanced, able to get on the floor with my grandchildren and play without much difficulty.  I am 5 ft 5 and weigh 140, walking 2 miles every other day, and working on discipline with eating, along with the yoga.  I already feel so much better and hopeful that Jane Adams will be able to help me stay on this journey of getting stronger and into a better, more confident shape.

6820786,5,B00PRABXFO,"Have only used it 2 times, but so far I am loving this Yoga workout. I am a novice at 69 and I do not find most of the poses too challenging. I would highly recommend this DVD to all who want to do Yoga at home.",1484265600,,211,3.5106382978723403

6820792,5,B00PRABXFO,I'm 27 and my husband is 30 and we are loving these exercises. I am not very flexible and my joints aren't either. I love the relaxed approach Jane takes. The backgrounds are beautiful and her voice is soothing. We also bought another DVD but I prefer Jane's as her transitions are better. So far we've done a couple of the routines individually. They are around 30 min each. As we progress we will do more than one in a session. They always seem to go by faster than I want them too. Great beginning DVD!,1484006400,,505,4.270833333333333

6820795,5,B00PRABXFO,"Gentle Yoga by Jane Adams is a great DVD for yoga beginners, seniors and inflexible people. The seven practices are perfect and allow us to to just one at a time or multiple practices. They vary in time from 8 minutes to about 34 minutes. Jane takes us through the practices in a slow and steady pace with clear explanation so that we can do the poses without constantly looking at the screen. My wife takes a yoga class for women but we both needed something to help with our core balance and this DVD is doing the trick. We have been using it in the morning for a few weeks now.",1483920000,,580,4.1875
6820796,5,B00PRABXFO,"This dvd is incredible and is changing the way that I start my day!  When I first ordered it from Amazon, I received a personal email from Jane, expressing her appreciation for ordering her DVD and asking me to contact her if there were any problems.  Unfortunately, the DVD skipped after the Morning Practice section.  I emailed Jane, and she emailed me back within 20 minutes!  She apologized and told me that she was mailing me a new one.  She emailed me again the next day to tell me that it was in the mail.  I still can't believe the incredible service from Jane!!!  I am 62 years old, ride horses when it's not freezing out, and experience stiffness.  I am already feeling more limber with just the morning practice! l I can't get over it!  I have recommended this DVD to several friends, and plan to order others.  You can't go wrong!",1483747200,,842,4.444444444444445

But I can do all of those exercises and have seen a big improvement in my flexibility, balance and overall well being. A side benefit is that my cat absolutely loves Jane Adams' voice and gets real mellow when she hears it.
I actually bought this copy as a gift to a friend because it done so good for me.",1483574400,,460,4.010869565217392

6820804,4,B00PRABXFO,"After injuring my foot with excessive walking (12 to 17 miles a day) and hiking, I decided to try yoga for the first time in my life. I wasn't stretching or warming up and my 52 year old body revolted. Learning from my mistake and wanting to allow time for healing, I started slow. I thought this would be easy and boring... Nope. I like the DVD. I found it easy to follow and Jane's voice is pleasant. I have nothing to compare to, so take it for what it's worth. There are a few times where she's saying something that's not matching her actions. I found that to be momentary distracting or confusing. I'm sure it's me because I learn different than most people but that's why it's not 5 stars. I'd give it 4.5 stars.",1482969600,6,719,4.255474452554744
6820805,5,B00PRABXFO,"I got this for Christmas. So far, it is gentle, but I have only done the morning yoga. I wanted to start out very slow.

Had been going to yoga classes at a health club, but your beautifull setting DVD allows me to practice yoga daily in my own home!  I'm trying to recover from a foot injury and am sure the daily balance and stretching sessions are helping me in my recovery. I can close my eyes, with your verbal instructions guiding my moves. I think you do a great job and I'm grateful to you for your easy style.",1482537600,,451,4.183908045977011
6820809,5,B00PRABXFO,"This is a great video for someone just beginning yoga, or going back to it after taking time away.  It eases you into the poses slowly.
I like that each workout is less than 45 min., so I don't feel I have to block out a large amount of time from my day.  I also like that the balance section encourages you to use a chair if you need it, but challenges you to let go & see how you do.  I have not tried all the workouts, yet, but every day I do one.  I also like that the floor workout does not involve getting up & down from the floor.  So many things to like about this DVD.  So happy with my purchase!  Highly recommended.",1482451200,,626,3.8818897637795278

6820811,5,B00PRABXFO,"I'm currently a middle-aged guy who is in decent shape but as flexible as a steel pole.  This disc provides a safe and sensible approach of trying to correct that.  I've spent approximately 5 hours with it and each time I'm done with a session, I feel SO much better.

One nice thing about this disc are the different sessions which focus on different parts of the body.  No one session is too long (longest being about 30 minutes) which makes it possible to do 2 different sessions each day.

If you are looking for a nice, calming, sensible approach of trying to get flexible - I highly suggest this.",1482364800,5,602,4.4363636363636365

However, I've only had this tape one week and I have done it twice. It is a little difficult right now, but I really like it. I find that I do what I can which is most of it. The parts that were difficult the first time seemed a teeny bit easier the second time. And after I finish the segments, I find that I really feel good! I had a lot of trouble with sciatica in 2015 and had to go to physical therapy. I find doing yoga regularly and walking have made a world of difference!

I also enjoyed the squirrel playing hide and seek. I suggest the instructor recommend having a chair or other support nearby when the routine calls for standing on one foot. She swayed at one point and I thought she was going to topple into the river. All the other moves were executed smoothly.

I have had some ""doing a new exercise"" muscle soreness, but I am pleased at how gentle and easy this practice is while pointing out where I need more work (because some things are more difficult than others for me). The setting and music are beautiful, Jane's voice is pleasant, and she gives you time to change your feet or breathe or move without feeling rushed. And she looks like a real person, not a near-anorexic gym mistress.

6820908,4,B00PRABXFO,"There is a lot to like about this practice for older people. Jane is not a drill sergeant, barking out orders like some of the popular glamour yogis currently being marketed everywhere. Jane allows us time to ""get into a pose"" and feel it, hold it. Many of the other practices in DVDs that I've discarded are 1 hour+ long - at a minimum. Jane breaks hers down into 10-30 minutes sessions. You can do as little or as much as you want. Only have 10 min? no problem, get a good stretch in the morning session. The scenery is excellent, although I never see a cloud move, the outdoor backdrop is just gorgeous.

Before I bought this, I read all the other reviews. It is truth that Jane has a ""baby talk"" that comes out and it can be annoying and a challenge with her. I listened to her freebie videos before purchasing and didn't hear it on those, but it is definitely on this DVD - some sessions more so (like the improving balance session is the worst) than others. I like the practice so much that I was able to overlook the babytalk. If she didn't do this, it would be 5 star review.  I would love to see this video redone with her correcting that issue - I'd buy it.",1474761600,5,1167,4.205357142857143

He has been suffering problems with gait, and I have noticed a loss in balance and flexibility, so we decided to try this DVD. I would imagine if you just watched us doing the poses and exercises, you would think it looks like no big deal, but when you actually do them, you'll you are stretching, toning and strengthening muscles you rarely use! Jane provides great instruction throughout, and you see by just the turn of an ankle, etc. that you can hit rarely-used muscles. We find it very effective!",1474588800,9,631,4.448275862068965

I am neither a senior or a beginning exerciser; that said, I am rehabbing a recent knee injury and appreciate the focus on balance, strength, and flexibility.  My most-used practices from this dvd are the 18 minute Morning Practice (great for restoring ease of movement after waking), Improving Balance (who knew I was so wobbly!?), and the Full-Body Lying Practice (I thought lying = relaxing/easy, and boy was I mistaken!)  This dvd offers a lot of content for a small price tag.  I assume it is great for beginners and seniors, but I think it is practical for all exercisers; anyone who wants to improve balance or relieve stiffness/pain or wants to gain flexibility can find something on this dvd.

It has helped me so much with all my low back and nerve issues.  There are lots of programs to choose from and all help me feel better. The natural setting is nice too and is very relaxing and cheerful as opposed to a boring room most routines are done in.  The only criticism I would give to this one is that I wish there more neck stretches.  Perhaps there on there but I haven't found them yet and I believe I've been through most of the dvd. Overall I just love it because I can't do that regular, fast-paced yoga that the general public does.  I am very, very thankful for this dvd!",1471910400,,720,4.107142857142857

6820941,5,B00PRABXFO,"It has been quite a while since I practiced any yoga - in fact much of any exercise other than walking - but I remembered how much better I felt when yoga was part of my life. Being middle aged, way out of practice and out of shape, I wanted a practice on DVD that could do in my home that would re-introduce my body to the stretches and poses yoga, but taking into consideration my body isn't what it was 15 years ago. ""Gentle Yoga: 7 Beginning Yoga Practices for Middle-Age"" seemed appropriate.

The quality of the DVD is not exceptional, but this is more about doing the poses and not about watching them done! The entire DVD was recorded in beautiful Glacier National Park, and it does feel much more soothing to look at that setting over some one doing yoga in a studio. Jane Adams has a calming and soothing voice as she guides the viewer into the poses. It is easy to follow along!

The DVD is divided up into 7 practices of varying length, though none really go much over 30 minutes. Most of the practices are right around 20 minutes. The viewer has the option of working through one practice, or they can work through several during one practice. The practices consist of Evening, Morning, Relaxation, Desk & Computer Relaxation, Lying Down, Balance, etc. Working through these will challenge a body that hasn't done any yoga or has taken a long hiatus from practicing and needs some extra easing into the practice. If some one is comfortable with yoga, this is probably not the DVD for you. The poses are very simple, there is stretching and breathing, but the practices on this DVD are not strenuous. However, if you need a very basic introduction to yoga - with care for a body that might not be as limber as it once was - these are vary satisfying practices.

Because this is very elementary and not at all strenuous, I would suspect if one utilizes this DVD regularly they would find a need to move on in their practice to either a DVD that is a little more challenging or going to a yoga studio.

I look forward to my ""time"" with Jane Adams. I find these practices to mesh well with those in middle-age or even seniors. Highly recommend!",1469664000,5,2152,4.440506329113924

If you've never done yoga before, this would be a good place to start.  If you hate yoga, my guess is you'll like this.  If you love yoga, but want shorter practices or something to do before bed, you'll love this.  If you're looking for something to do during a short break at work, you'll love this...there's even a sitting practice to address working at a desk/computer.  If it's no obvious, I think this is ax excellent price for some exceptional and accessible practices.

6820947,5,B00PRABXFO,"My wife, Katja, and I both teach yoga on the beach in Venice Fl and also groups and individuals in clubhouses and private homes. Many of our clients are older so they have a variety of abilities and special needs.
We often look to others to gain knowledge and see different styles or approaches. Besides attending other teacher's classes we often watch videos on line or on DVD. We found ""Gentle Yoga: 7 Beginning Yoga Practices for Mid-life (40's - 70's)"" very helpful our teaching and in our own practice.

No hype here, just one person doing the Asanas while the teacher does voice over instruction and guidance. I assume, both the voice and the yogi demonstrating the pose are one in the same, Jane Adams. The instruction is excellent and her style very pleasant (style is always subjective).  The scenery is dramatic yet tranquil.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone from beginner to intermediate regardless of age and ability.
Fore those with limited balance and mobility who wish to improve on both, this DVD is almost perfect..",1468540800,5,1038,4.787709497206704
6820948,5,B00PRABXFO,"I cannot say enough good things about this DVD. I've given it as gifts to almost everyone I know. I tried yoga a few years ago in a lovely local yoga studio and threw my back out so badly that it took me 6 months to get back to normal. So I was scared of trying yoga again. But I have a bad back, so I bought this on a whim. I do the Core and Flexibility section every day if I can. It makes me feel so much better and more limber. It's very gentle, but it works every joint. Great breathing too. I have done all of the other sections as well and love them all. Jane Adams is a fantastic instructor. There is nothing irritating about her or the visuals. It's all very relaxing and empowering. I wish she had an entire library! I am not a ""yoga"" person--and never thought I would be. But because of this tape, I can see making this a lifelong practice.",1468195200,2,851,4.011764705882353

6820951,5,B00PRABXFO,"In a search for an exercise program that would work, my wife first bought some of Jane Adam's Yoga For Seniors DVDs over a year ago.  She enjoyed the practices and encouraged me to try them.  I eventually did, and have been enjoying them ever since.  I try to do a Yoga practice about 5-6 days a week in my downstairs Gym area. I have an improved sense of feeling connected to my body, and feel more connected to life around me.  In this particular tape in the series, the Core Strength & Flexibility, Standing Poses - Flow & Traditional, and Improving Balance are the practices I enjoy the most.  As a 60 something guy from suburban Philadelphia, PA who took a serious fall a few years ago, the Improving Balance practice is near and dear to my heart. Jane's DVDs are well planned, designed, and executed.  I appreciate the thought and effort that Jane put into the finished product. Jane has a special gift as a Yoga Instructor, and I very much appreciate her distinctive soothing and nurturing vocal style.",1467244800,2,1009,4.54696132596685

I'm 72, but there were young people in their 30's in the class and a 96 year old woman.  Everyone just stayed in the class because our teacher challenged us beyond beginner.  I now would have to drive a distance to go to classes (although I miss the group experience) and am trying to get back to disciplining myself to do yoga at home.

He is picky about instructors and gets irritated easily (especially when I'm doing my Leslie Sansone DVDs, lol).  He says Jane isn't annoying...he even likes her voice, and finds it soothing after a busy day.  The practices are challenging enough for him that he feels like he's doing something useful, but not so challenging that he gets frustrated.  His favorite section is the 34-minute practice done on the floor.  There is beautiful scenery throughout, with a different setting for each segment.

Plus no one teaches it here. Then he suggested Yoga, and after reviewing this tape, I think I can do this. It appears I've been doing yoga for years in different exercise routines. And I can find classes here. So I'm set. What I like about this DVD is the different segments, timed out for different uses and times of the day, very helpful.

6820971,5,B00PRABXFO,I love this yoga practice.  It is gentle and do-able even for those with limited flexibility.  The scenery is beautiful and Jane's voice is very warm and encouraging.  The background music is nice and not intrusive.  I love to start my day with the 18 minute morning energy practice.  It doesn't require any equipment - not even a mat and because of it's brevity I'm able to fit it in on busy work days.  I've lately been having major issues with insomnia - I have found that I sleep better on those nights when I do her 29 minute evening practice followed by the 8 minute relaxation.  Prior to purchasing this dvd I borrowed at least 8 beginner yoga dvd's from the library including ones by Rodney Yee.  While they were okay - this one is absolutely hands down my favorite.  Highly recommended.,1464393600,3,795,4.503496503496503
6820972,4,B00PRABXFO,I started a Yoga class and this video coincides with the way my Yoga instructor teaches her class and the way Jane Adams teaches on this video. Sometimes I think that they must have learned their Yoga under the same Guru.,1464307200,,221,4.414634146341464

6820979,5,B00PRABXFO,"I love this DVD and it has me doing yoga on days I don't feel like doing anything.  First, it contains several shorter practices with different concentrations so I can pick exactly how long I want to practice and what type of practice I want to pursue.  If I don't feel like getting on the floor, there is a standing-only practice.  If I don't feel like getting up, there is a floor-only practice.  (The practice for people who work at a desk really revealed my weak shoulders and tight hips.  I should probably do that one daily!)  Second, the instructor is not a 20-year-old blonde, and not to be prejudiced, but now that I am in my late 40s, I like to practice with someone closer to my own age.  Third, the voiceover instructions are clear and easy to follow, and sometimes the instructor will supplement the voice instructions with her hands.  Fourth, the practices are filmed in some of the most gorgeous scenery I have ever seen in a workout video.  Fifth, this finally a DVD with ""beginning"" in the title that actually presents yoga in a way beginners can follow.  (Other ""beginner"" DVDs I have used seem to be designed for experts in ballet or Pilates who are nonetheless trying out yoga for the first time.  No, I am an overweight, inflexible BEGINNER.)

Like I said before, I love this DVD, and the only negative I can mention is that the relaxation practice wasn't really what I was looking for.  I have a Rodney Yee DVD where he finishes the practice with the best relaxation sequence I have ever experienced, and I was hoping it would be more like that.  But not using that one routine certainly does not discount the value I receive from this DVD and I look forward to using it in the years to come.",1463097600,7,1714,4.469453376205788

I am in my 70's and have been a student of yoga for over 15 years but have stopped going to a studio and practice at home instead.  I could do a routine while listening to music but I find I tend to rush when on my own.  By using a DVD the workout becomes more deliberative and complete.  I especially like Jane's different sections and her rankings from easy to more difficult workouts.  When time allows, I am now beginning and ending my days with this DVD.  I've also recommended it to several friends and shared it with my tai chi group who enjoyed the morning energize segment.  A friend who is the HR manager of a large law firm is going to make the DVD available in the office  gym because of the segment for those who sit at a desk in front of a computer all day.

6821013,5,B00PRABXFO,"I received this product on Jan 2, 2016 (a gift to myself for the new year!). I've suffered off and on from lower back pain for approximately 30+ years. It waxes and wanes and at times the pain can be incapacitating. I wish I'd have had this in my 20s. It would have saved me from muscle relaxants and opiates to get me through the extreme flare ups! I even had a steroid injection a few years back to help alleviate pain. When I received this DVD, I had been experiencing a nagging 2 week flare up of back pain following a ""tent"" sleepover with my oldest grandson. I popped in the DVD and began with the core strengthening exercises. At first I wasn't sure I could complete the exercises because of the discomfort I was experiencing, but I took it slow and with each movement and each stretch I began to experience a loosening of the muscles. I was really amazed at how good I felt following the exercises. Honestly, within 1 week the back pain totally dissipated. I've definitely been gaining core strength, but took a bit of a break because I'd been feeling so good. However, after a day of watching and bouncing around my 5 month old grandson, I began noticing the onset of a flare. I immediately popped in the DVD, and same result! I am a believer, and convinced now that I will need to make this a part of my daily routine. My 3 grandboys are sure to grow way too fast, and I want to be able to play with them for as long as they're interested in spending time with me. I'm just not ready to slow down!

6821018,5,B00PRABXFO,"As a 65-year-old who has never done yoga before this DVD was perfect for me.  It is well paced, well organized, and easy to follow.  Jane's routines leave me feeling good - relaxed and stretched - which I guess is part of the point of yoga.  There is a selection of types of routines (morning, evening, improving balance, core strength and flexibility, relief from too much desk work or sitting) and it's easy to go directly to the one you want.  Highly recommended.",1456963200,2,466,4.578313253012048

There are several segments - i.e. morning stretch, 18 minutes etc so you can scroll through the segments and choose the one that fits your needs and /or time constraints.  I begin with the morning stretch each morning and love the way I feel during the yoga and after.  Jane gives good instructions so it is easy to understand.  I recommend this video.",1456790400,,426,4.3544303797468356
6821021,5,B00PRABXFO,"I LOVE this DVD.  I'm not really a yoga person.  I do like a good workout, not too strenuous but effective.  I like to do floor exercises, the rebounder, the barr method (which is actually quite hard) Tony Little's exercise bar.  I'm in my late 50's and I have neck and back issues from a lot of physical work and car accidents.  I've gone to the chiropractor over the years. So over the last year and a half I slacked off on any regular exercise routine and knew I had to get started without exasperating my body.  So After really looking at the different DVD'S to ease back in, I came across this one. I did not want to start right back into the barr method even though I eventually will because it really makes your body look great.  In the past other yoga programs actually hurt my body plus I wasn't really liking the routines of yoga. Which brings me to this Gentle Yoga by Jane Adams.  It is excellent.  I love it. The DVD is divided into 7 routines.  Jane does a great job at explaining each move as she is doing it with a voice over.  The exercises feel so good.  I love the Morning Energy routine, they are all good.  Jane is in her 50's and she looks fantastic.  I find her voice to be fine and not annoying at all.  One of the best things about this DVD is the beautiful scenery, it's right up my ally. It is filmed in the beautiful outdoors in Glacier National Park and you actually feel like you are there.  This has started to make my body feel really good again, no back or neck issues.  I've been doing it for about 6-7 weeks.  This will help me ease into more exercising. I highly recommend this program and will continue to use for many years to come.  Very Happy I found this.  Thank You Jane!",1456444800,20,1713,4.196319018404908

6821027,5,B00PRABXFO,This is my favorite Jane Adams yoga DVD.  My wife and I watch at least one practice (our favorite is Core Strength & Flexibility)  6-7 days a week followed by the 8 minute Relaxation at the end.  Last July (2015) we started attending Gentle Yoga classes twice a week with a 67 year old lady instructor.  The instructor has 37 years of experience and is an excellent teacher.  She suggested to the class on many occasions that we practice at home.  She had a CD which we purchased and attempted to use at home.  It was somewhat helpful but both of us are visual people so I looked for a DVD on Amazon.  I purchased one that I thought would work and tried it.  Unfortunately the pace was too rapid for most 67 & 71 year old people.  I looked further and found Jane Adams.  I first purchased Yoga For Seniors (2014) which was a great improvement and next we purchased Gentle Yoga: 7 Beginning Yoga Practices for Your Day.  This was the perfect one for us because we could easily mix & match the 7 practices to give us variety.  This DVD has literally changed are lives.  We look forward playing it on our Home Theater with our yoga mats facing the flat panel TV.  The effect is that we feel like we are with Jane on the shore of Lake McDonald in Glacier National Park (which we have visited).  Her pace is perfect for us and we are always in sync with her moves.  Recently I purchased a third DVD:  Stronger Standing Balance which we are currently viewing.  Review to follow soon.  I highly recommend Gentle Yoga to most anyone as their first Yoga DVD.,1455494400,45,1549,4.331010452961673

6821036,5,B00PRABXFO,"I took yoga classes for several years but stopped when my teacher retired and I subsequently moved to the country.  In time, I realized that my body had lost much of its flexibility, so I decided to try easing back in on my own, and I chose Jane Adams' DVD (along with a couple of others) based on Amazon reviews. This DVD is perfect for me.  Unlike in so many instructional videos, directions are given in voiceover so that the poses being modeled are exactly what one is expected to do, and the instructor does not have to interrupt/adjust her movements in order to talk to her audience.  The pace is slow and controlled, so there's actually time to watch the pose being done correctly and to do it oneself before Ms. Adams moves on to another pose.  The directions are detailed and clear, and the poses are achievable for a novice or a person, like me, who is returning after a number of years away from the practice. The longest lessons are 34 minutes, i.e., manageable for all of us with busy schedules, and I particularly enjoy the 18-minute ""Morning Energy"" practice, which limbers me up for the day.",1454716800,3,1107,4.52

I have only done two of the segments and found them to be challenging but not overwhelming, The instructions were clear and well timed; Jane's voice is soothing, not at all annoying. It was demanding enough that I thought I might have increased soreness following the exercise but I tolerated it well. I had already been doing a modified yoga routine on my own but found this to incorporate a lot more varied moves and to exercise more areas than what I had been doing. The pace is perfect. My plan is to do a different segment each day and then repeat the sequence. As a retired therapist however, I must say that this would not be appropriate if you have had hip replacements.

6821060,5,B00PRABXFO,"Gentle Yoga - 7 Practices For Your Day is actually 7 yoga routines and a separate Relaxation totaling about 187 minutes (over 3 hours) of instruction. All the routines are instructed outdoors in an absolute gorgeous mountain location (Glacier National Park) often standing in front of a lake with the mountains in the background or along a river or among trees along a trail. Jane does the routines alone and her instruction is by voice over. Her instructions are clear and never blocked by the gentle music in the background. The camera work usually shows her from head to toe and takes in the scenery in the background. If you have a large screen TV you will appreciate it. You will mirror her meaning she will tell you to move you right arm and she will move her left so that it is like looking in a mirror and this makes it really easy to follow along. The DVD itself is very easy to navigate from the main menu. Jane's opening and introduction is separated so you don't have to play that every time before you get to the routine you want to do.

The practices with a few notes are below:

1. Lying Full Body Practice (34 Minutes)
Filmed amid large trees on a path/trail. All done on the floor on a yoga mat. Lots of stretches, twist, hugging knees to chest, leg lifts, leg circles and more. I found this to be an exceptionally relaxing routine and didn't want it to end. This routine alone, in my opinion, would be worth the price of the DVD.

2. Morning Energy Practice (18 Minutes)
Filmed by a river with trees in background. All done standing. Jane is barefoot on the grass but I found a yoga mat useful. Lots of stretches, twists, breathing with arm movements, and more.

3. Desk & Computer Work Relief (19 Minutes)
Filmed in front of a mountain lake with mountains in background. Combination of exercises sometimes sitting in a chair and sometimes standing. Lots of twists, stretches, face massage, shoulder rolls, quad stretch, wrist exercises and more. A great routine for any time and or purpose.

4. Improving Balance (22 Minutes)
Filmed in front of a mountain lake with mountains in background. A chair is used for part of the routine but could be utilized more if you have balancing issues. Exercises include tree pose, leg circles and more. I liked her exercise of standing then putting on imaginary socks and then imaginary shoes.

5. Standing Poses - Flow & Traditional (23 Minutes)
Filmed in front of a mountain lake with kayaks out in the water and mountains in background. You will need a yoga mat and chair. In this routine there is more emphasis towards traditional yoga poses which are modified from what you would often see in a regular yoga class. Using the chair as a prop she does standing forward bends, plank, downward facing dog, warrior 1, triangle, and more.

6. Core Strength & Flexibility (34 Minutes)
Filmed in front of a mountain lake with mountains in background. You should have a yoga mat and possibly a blanket. The exercises are down on the mat either sitting, on hands and knees, lying on back and lying on stomach. You'll do staff pose, boat pose, cat/cow, cobra, child's pose, forearm plank, bridge pose, a traditional downward facing dog, and more. There were two poses that I never came across before and which I really enjoyed which she calls Lizard and the other Half Twisting Camel. She also goes through a relaxing lower back massage technique where you lie on the mat and move your pelvis.

7. Evening Relaxing Practice (29 Minutes)
Filmed in front of lake with mountains in background. You should have a yoga mat, chair, yoga strap, and optional blanket. This routine is done sitting in the chair, sitting on the mat, and lying on the mat. You'll start off with modified down dog, modified forward bends, sitting twists, shoulder rolls, eagle arms, neck stretches. Sitting on mat exercises include sitting forward bends, and cobbler pose. Lying on the mat includes leg stretches using the strap, lying twists and a short relaxation.

8. Relaxation (8 Minutes)
Filmed in front of a mountain lake. All done lying on a yoga mat. You may want a pillow and a blanket to roll to place under your knees. Jane guides you through a relaxation so peaceful you may have to consciously choose to remain alert or you may drift off to sleep. This relaxation could be done on its own or added to any of the routines above.

In summary, I find this DVD to be outstanding. The instruction is expert, the location and filming is exquisite. the DVD is easy to navigate, you get lots of choices of routines and over 3 hours of instruction. To be clear this is Gentle Yoga, not athletic or power yoga so it goes at a slower pace and is not physically exhausting. This DVD will stand the test of time as there is little about it that will make it appear dated from the outdoor location to Jane's choice of attire. I have collected hundreds of exercise DVDs over the years and this one will be one I will return to many times when I am looking for a slower paced meditative style yoga.

I am using this video in addition to going for physical therapy.  Many of the yoga videos I have previewed - especially those for seniors - are too easy for me.  They don't offer the lower body challenge that I need.  This video has quite a bit to offer.  In the synopsis, you will note that it is broken into segments, giving you options as to whether you want to work on your core strength, improve your balance (some of the balance poses can be done while holding the back of a chair for safety), or practice poses while lying on a mat, etc.  There are quite a few poses I cannot even ATTEMPT at this point, but therein lies the challenge.  I wanted a yoga video that offered more than just sitting in a chair waving my arms around.  This morning I did the 23 minute segment ""Standing Poses, Flow & Traditional"".  Because of my arthritis and my office job, I have spent too much time sitting.  The muscles in my hips and glutes are weak, and need strengthening, as does my core.  I purchased the video 4 months ago, and I believe it will offer a good workout and challenge for a long time to come.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1444608000,5,1240,4.2703862660944205

I just recently tried the one for ""Mid-day Relief from Desk & Computer Work"" and it was amazing!  I almost always have pain between my shoulder blades and it was gone.  Ahhh.... relief.  And when I'm in a pinch for time I enjoy the 18 minute ""Morning Practice.""  I definitely like the stretching and relaxing and the sense of peace that Jane brings.  I have several other yoga dvds that I consider tougher and more ""yoga-like"" but I still really enjoy this one and I like mixing it up depending on my mood or how my body feels.",1442707200,29,1013,4.3121693121693125

6821079,5,B00PRABXFO,"This is a nice collection of short (average about 20 minutes) routines I am loathe to call yoga.  It is definitely yoga inspired, but they aren't as intense as standard yoga routines.  This is more what might be called active rest.  I've been using them sometimes at the end of the day, to unkink my body and relax my mind.  I also used the morning energy routine the other morning when I was fighting off a bug and didn't want to skip exercise altogether but wasn't up to my usual intense exercise. It got me moving and felt very healing, but I would not use it for a a regular workout.

Added: the more I do these segments, the more I appreciate the very deliberate instruction on form. I wish I'd had access to this information when I first did yoga years ago.",1441929600,4,763,4.3076923076923075

The music is beautiful, but never loud, so it doesn't drown out the speaker's voice. Plenty of time is allowed to change props, if that is called for.

I am 62, out-of-shape, and this is perfect for me. The instruction is wonderfully detailed, the visuals are clear (and the outdoor background is beautiful) - and what's more, I can feel that I am working at an edge that is truly developing my strength and flexibility.

6821091,5,B00PRABXFO,"Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams is an absolutely wonderful DVD for people that are just beginning with yoga, for people suffering from sciatica, for people who have had injuries, for people who live a sedentary lifestyle and want to incorporate a healthful, but gentle exercise program into their lives, or for people who are older. I actually qualify for all of those things mentioned. This DVD is also a very healthful way to learn to how alleviate stress out of your life, as well. Besides sustaining injury and dealing with sciatica, I am also an older, non-traditional student who lives a sedentary life right now due to a heavy course load at school. This video will also help you stretch out and strengthen your body, if you sit in a chair all day like me. I never thought I'd be purchasing a DVD for exercise as I have always lived a very active lifestyle until now, but I am finding that I actually much prefer this over every type of exercise I have ever done! I 'want' to do it every day throughout the day, whereas other forms of exercise took much
self -encouragement on some days just to get going. Jane moves along at a pace you can follow and she explains everything as you are doing it. I have gotten to the point to where I just close my eyes and relax in the different stretches and poses to enjoy it and relax more.  I highly recommend your purchase of this product! It was created with excellence and the scenery is beautiful and relaxing. After reviewing many DVDs for yoga, I feel I made the best choice!   -Robin

I have been using this DVD now for about two years and can say that the benefits are wonderful! I prefer using a DVD for yoga over going to a class or YMCA setting as the ability to focus on what my body is doing is so much easier because the distractions of being in a facility aren't there. It's also extremely relaxing because of the aforementioned fact. I still ""highly recommend"" this video!! ",1437955200,31,1932,4.446327683615819

Eventually it healed, but the injury left me off balance...Partly because for several months I couldn't bear weight on that foot, and partly because the injury left me somewhat hesitant, feeling afraid that I might fall again. I took advantage of physical therapy, but I knew I needed more. . Well, long of the short of it is, this Gentle Yoga DVD was just what I was looking for....Not only did it help with my balance,  but my flexibility as well. I've never done Yoga before and I really wasn't sure I could do it. But slowly but surely, with Jane Adams' help, I'm hooked!

There are 8 different workouts so you can choose what you feel like doing that day. Jane moves in and out of poses slowl enough so you feel like you are getting a good stretch which is exactly what I was looking for.

 At the beginning of the DVD, the viewer is informed that three of the practices are more difficult and I haven't tried those yet but have done all the others.  Jane is very easy to follow and explains the poses extremely well.  She is not instructing while doing the poses as her instructions are voiced over.  I find this to be very helpful since she isn't talking while she's telling us to be breathing and she is focused entirely on the poses.
I feel so stretched and good and look forward to doing the more difficult routines soon.  I definitely will buy more of Jane's DVDs as soon as I'm physically ready.",1435449600,3,839,4.444444444444445

I am very new to yoga; although I am not vey limber, the stretches are slow, gentle and effective.  Less pain in my muscles after the workout.  Ms. Adams descriptions are good, and she allows time to change positions.  I l bought this instead of  Young at Heart because it has may more sessions. I haven't tried all yet but the four I have are easy to follow form an instructional viewpoint.  I find I yearn a little for Young at heart because of the delicious relaxation stretches at the end of the session  On this video, I have to play a separate  relaxation session..not quite the same vibe.",1434585600,5,742,4.444444444444445

My most recent hiatus from yoga has left me weak and suffering from lower back trouble. I have tried many times to rekindle my yoga practice only to hurt myself, even though I always thought I was being careful. This DVD has shown me what a truly knowledgeable instructor can do for you. The sequences don't seem difficult, but they are effective! The first time I did the core strengthening sequence I was left with tired ab muscles but NO BACK PAIN. Each sequence is about a half hour long or less, so they fit perfectly into a busy day. I have tried other yoga DVDs of similar length that left me wanting more after each sequence, but Jane Adams gets the job done in the time allotted. The DVD is organized well, easy to use, and doesn't make you sit through extras you don't need. Jane Adams has a soothing presence, even in a recording.

She is explaining basic moves in the most detailed way for perfect form. I thought we already knew how to do a good set of Warrior poses, for example, But Jane's step by step set-ups for the poses have improved the poses for us, with detailed instructions about knee placements and where exactly to turn the hips and chest. She explains every single pose and doesn't assume you already know what you are doing. I like how long she holds poses, not too long or too short, and she gives you plenty of time to change poses. There are 7 different sets of practices on this one tape, each lasting about 25 minutes or so. Plenty of variety. My husband and I have tried them all and just love them.

6821116,5,B00PRABXFO,"After years and years of walking on my treadmill I got bored with it, gave it away and wanted to try something new.  I purchased this DVD hoping that this is something I could learn to love and do.  First of all, let me tell you that this is excellent for the 50+ crowd.  The instructor walks you through step by step and makes you feel really comfortable.  The exercises are geared for the 50+ crowd and I don't feel defeated doing them.  I have tried other forms of exercise DVD's only to feel lost and left behind but this is not so with this DVD.  The instructor is so graceful with her moves that I can't wait to get to this point, what beautifully slow and peaceful movements.  I didn't feel rushed or pushed over my limits while I do feel I have exercised.  At first I tried the morning relaxation exercise and thought, how is this exercise?  Then I tried the core and strengthening exercise and thought, I am extremely out of shape.  I don't know how and can't explain it but this really works.  I could feel the difference in my posture with wanting sit straighter and was even remembering to push my shoulders back lengthening my back.  I love the total relaxation exercise!  It's 8 minutes of pure bliss, and it sets my mood for the stressful work day ahead and help me to relax.  After only a week of doing the core and strengthening I could feel the pull and difference in my muscles.  All I can think now is, wow this stuff really works.  I highly recommend not only the instructor and the DVD but the workouts for the 50+ crowd.  This is something I will be doing for a long time to come.  I will update 6 months from now and let you know how it's going.",1432080000,19,1669,4.261146496815287

6821118,5,B00PRABXFO,My husband and I purchased this as an introduction to Yoga in our home. We both love this DVD! This new practice of Yoga in our life has brought much needed relief anytime we are feeling soreness. My favorite are the early morning and evening practice. I sit at a desk for work and it really helps open up the shoulder and neck pain I can experience. I do jump around from time to time and do other routines as well and each routine brings its own unique set of stretches to different parts of our bodies. It is very relaxing and meditative to do these routines. If you are looking for a introductory or just a nice way to practice yoga in your home I highly recommend this! We are both in our 50's and it is just never too late to begin working on flexibility and muscle strength. Give it a try! Make sure you buy a yoga mat if you are new to yoga.

I'm so tired in the morning when I first wake up (at 5:30 am) and my body feels really stiff (at age 40) so this is about all I can or want to do that early. I love the simplicity of the video. Her voice is great, instructions are straight-forward and scenery is breathtaking.",1427414400,,318,4.145161290322581

6821139,4,B00PRABXFO,It was what I expected. Great for anyone my age.,1426896000,,48,3.9
6821140,5,B00PRABXFO,Well done with precise instructions.  You are told how to hold your muscles etc. to achieve the poses and do them correctly.  You don't often find this in most exercise videos.,1426377600,3,176,4.645161290322581
6821141,5,B00PRABXFO,I highly recommend this to anyone.  I'm 54 and have limited time in the morning before work. While I enjoy all the practices the 18 minute morning stretch practice is perfect for me! I feel MUCH better throughout the day and its short enough I have time to work it in my morning routine.,1426291200,3,287,4.314814814814815

6821143,5,B00PRABXFO,"I tried Yoga many years ago with a DVD. It was too hard & too long at 60 minutes so I gave it up. Now that I am older and stiffer, I wanted to do something to get limber and improve my balance. I regularly ride my bike, but that doesn't help all my joints. After trying this Jane Adams DVD, I was inspired to stay with it. She efficiently describes the movements. The routines are shorter and are specific to different goals. The morning routine is a great way to begin the day. It's less than 20 minutes so is easy to incorporate into a daily routine. I have seen many improvements in just 1 month. I can bend my arthritic knees much better and without pain. I'm sleeping better and feel more inspired to respect and care for my health.",1425772800,6,737,4.197183098591549
6821144,5,B00PRABXFO,"This yoga is the first I have ever done and at age 75, it is somewhat challenging for me.  I really like that you need only select the particular area or practice you wish to do for that day.  It is divided into 7 different types of practice:  lying down, morning energy, desk and computer work, improving balance, core strength and flexibility, standing poses, evening practice and relaxation.  The three I choose on a regular basis are lying down, improving balance and core strength and flexibility.  Each one of these gives me a good practice and I think it is making me stronger.  I would heartily recommend this yoga CD.",1425686400,193,626,4.6454545454545455
6821145,5,B00PRABXFO,"Love Jane Adams!  Her yoga DVD's are wonderful!  This one fits into life all throughout the day.  Energizing yoga to start your day, yoga if you get stiff at the computer or your desk, yoga for balance, yoga to strengthen your core, yoga for flexibility, yoga to end your day - something for most any time of the day.  She has many wonderful dvd's so there is probably something for everyone.  I truly enjoy her dvd's!",1425513600,2,418,4.447368421052632

6821149,5,B00PRABXFO,I love this DVD!  I have tried at least five of the 7 practices so far and have enjoyed all of them. They are indeed gentle but she does enough that I feel like I've done something.  I have tried some gentle yoga that is so gentle I feel like I haven't done anything.  I first bought Jane's Balance DVD and it is also excellent.  I have a big problem with balance and her balance DVD really helps.  Gentle yoga has one 22-minute balance practice and includes some balance work in some of the other practices.  The bonus to these practices is the gorgeous scenery.  The only bad thing is that the sound is very low.  I have to turn up the volume a LOT but then I can hear just fine.  I highly recommend this DVD!,1425081600,5,711,4.131386861313868

6821153,5,B00PRABXFO,"My 15 year old daughter and I wanted to start doing yoga together.  Even though the description (and title) says for mid life (perfect for me) my daughter loves this DVD as well.  Jane Adams describes the moves so well that I often don't have to look at the TV to know what I'm supposed to be doing and she clearly anticipates the problems beginners might have.  She'll say something like ""relax your face,"" and I'll realize that sure enough, the muscles in my face were tensed up.  Or, she'll mention to make sure your weight is balanced on all parts of your foot, and yep, I'll have been putting weight on one part more than another.  My daughter likes her relaxing voice since relaxation was one reason we started doing yoga to begin with.  So, if you're a beginner but aren't yet 40, don't let the title dissuade you from trying this DVD.",1423958400,15,842,4.435064935064935
6821154,5,B00PRABXFO,"A great follow-up to Jane Adam's other yoga DVDs.  As always, she delivers clear and precise instructions that allow for the learner's immediate success.

6821155,5,B00PRABXFO,"This DVD by Jane Adams is very effective in keeping my body stretched, flexible and strong.  I've been amazed at how my balance and flexibility have improved.  Jane talks you through the different poses as she does them herself in the beauty of nature.  I usually do two practices working different areas of my body.  The Yoga poses help greatly in reducing my mild arthritis pain and stiffness.  gf42",1423008000,5,401,4.753623188405797

I'm  a pretty fit 68 and wanted a truly ""gentle"" video, no headstands.  This one is PERFECT!  Just what I've been looking for.  I can do a little or a lot, and I love this instructor.

6821160,5,B00PRABXFO,"Great variety and flawless instruction are the basis for Jane's latest DVD.  Her voice is so relaxing and calm I can feel my blood pressure drop the minute I turn the DVD on.  Jane pays close attention to safety for elders and I really benefit from doing her practices almost every day.  The soft background music and gorgeous outdoor setting add to a totally enjoyable experience.  Whether you want to spend a few minutes or an hour you will be able to find the perfect workout for each day you choose to practice with Jane and better your life.  One of the most surprising things about Yoga is the way it helps dispel innate anger through no effort other than doing your practice-great benefit for me and my family.  I am 71 and hope to be able to do these for another 20 years-optimistic maybe, maybe not.",1419379200,106,808,4.462585034013605
