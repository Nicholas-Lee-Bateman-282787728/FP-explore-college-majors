7601093,5,B01AHK50AC,Well acted mystery. Confusing in the beginning but the end is good.,1453507200,,67,4.666666666666667
7601094,4,B01AHK50AC,"I don't know what folks are talking about, judge for yourself. Me and my hubby thought it was a good movie. Certainly not below 3 stars in our opinion. Yes more could of been said about other things, but use you imagination, good grief.",1453507200,,236,4.386363636363637
7601095,4,B01AHK50AC,"Held my interest.....both story lines interesting in their own right until the end when they combine....there were plot lines never finished, but overall a good mystery.",1453507200,2,169,5.538461538461538
7601096,1,B01AHK50AC,"This is the worse movie I have ever watched.  There is some explanation of what is happening at the last of the movie but there so many unexplained plot lines that go absolutely nowhere.  I would suggest not wasting your time watching this, even if it is the last movie on earth!",1453507200,6,279,4.346153846153846
7601097,4,B01AHK50AC,"A young Dominican woman is seeing unusual visions at a subway platform in Washington Heights. A police detective is investigating his ethically dubious partner's murder. This film occupies itself with the intersection between the lives of these two characters. The film is well paced and engrossing early on, and offers realism of city and family life within this community. Later on, there is a reveal which is moving and has a serious social message to convey.
  The social and psychological drama of Isabel, a fervently religious young child-care worker whose husband is serving in Iraq, and her boisterous and loving extended family, is the most engaging. The first scene really draws you in, and she continues to draw your sympathies. Our heartstrings are also plucked by Elisa, a small girl in her day care who seems to be having problems at home, and who Isabel feels very protective toward. I feel a great deal of credit should be given to the director and to Ana de Armas to a particular scene which could have been played a number of different ways but which was given both the credibility and level of sensitivity which was its due.
  The detective Scott Galban, played by Keanu Reeves, is very quiet and full of pain. He is widowed, grieving for his partner, and has a young son who he loves but can't quite cope with caring for while under his current stress--he is with Galban's sister. In one scene he calls him to thank him for a birthday card, and afterwards beats himself up physically without much explanation, and it is perplexing. The most frustrating part of this film for me was how the script did not call for any articulation in this character.  The partner's widowed wife, played by Mira Sorvino, is highly demanding. She wants her husband's murder investigated to the fullest, while at the same time does not want his many misdeeds to come to light in the process. She also wants Galban for dinner.
  Big Daddy Kane has gravitas as the kingpin Jonathan ""Black"" Jones, and it is said in promos, and by the detective, that his character has ""motive"", but in the film his actions seem to exceed any feasable motive--ie they constitute a plot defect.  Shout out also to Gabe Vargas as Rocky, whose performance was full of win, and to Laura Gomez from Orange Is The New Black.
  All in all the movie achieves an admirable pacing, and tone, but is a little confused about what it wants to be. It is reported that another, original version of the film, the director's vision prior to the intervention of the studio, is significantly better edited and casts more light on the central themes and characters. One hopes that this director's cut, carrying the original ""Daughter of God"" title, will be made available in the near future.",1453420800,28,2751,4.7364016736401675
7601098,2,B01AHK50AC,"Keanu Reeves  (Det. Galban) either does a great movie or a very poorly made movie.  Unfortunately, this was not good.  If I had realized that Mira Sorvino (Janine Cullen/Glaban's partner's wife) was in the movie too, that would have thrown a red flag.  She's good in the TV Movie arena but nothing more.  This movie was free to watch through Hulu, if you're a subscriber.  But, it kept having streaming problems.  Just that one movie too.  I guess someone was trying to tell me then, not to waste my time.  Now, I've wasted time & money.  I would say that there are about 4 different storylines that just jump in and out from each other and are barely threaded together to make up one big storyline.  Some of the stories were just barely hanging on from all the broken threads (I hope you get my meaning).  It's not even worth watching just to look at Keaanu because, he looks tired and worn out (like a real cop, lol)..  Sorry, that last line was directed more to my hubby's days when he was a detective.",1525219200,,1005,4.396739130434782

7601101,4,B01AHK50AC,"The bad reviews must have been based on dashed expectations of those looking for a Keanu Reeves shoot em up. (Please! They are still counting up the dead in the Wick films.). This film is better than its overall review scores, and in spite of the fact that the director hid behind a pseudonym. You do need to pay attention to the braided plotlines, one in Spanish with subtitles and the other in English, and they each tell compelling stories that come together at the end. As a writer of mysteries, I was intrigued with the approach to this one. The story telling method was a risk, which obviously does not appeal to all, even the pro critics (who should be ignored at all costs anyway). For many, though, the film will satisfy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VOTE-A-Vic-Bengston-Investigation-Vic-Bengston-Investigations-Book-2/dp/B01821AO4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VOTE: A Vic Bengston Investigation (Vic Bengston Investigations Book 2)</a>",1520553600,,991,5.841379310344828

7601107,2,B01AHK50AC,What a waste of good acting talent. Story goes no where - snippets of disjointed logic. A cereal box commercial has better cohesiveness.  It kept getting worse by the minute. I know some people would say it was a 5**** - but that implies their need for entertainment is way below the level of thinking (rational anyway)  viewers hoping to get some bang for buck from  their investment - of time (to watch)  and money (to buy) this absurdity paranoia. If you haven't vacuumed out your car or washed your dog - skip this movie and get down to some serious business. The title says it all - this exemplifies the tripe Hollywood is pumping out to compete with T.V. ridiculousness. Brain overload is result of this movie if you try to figure out why it was made - let alone piece it all together. PS - I did - that's why I gave this review - astronomically disappointed.,1503446400,3,865,4.421383647798742

7601112,2,B01AHK50AC,"Well, first of all, I rented the wrong movie. There's another movie Keanu Reeves did last year and that's the one I thought I was getting. My mistake but I'd already decided I didn't like this movie on its own merits -- or demerits.

The only reason I finished watching this was that I kept telling myself that it just HAD to make sense by the end. No director would leave anything such a mess. Well, the loose ends were mostly tied up, but it was still a mess.

The reason this is bad isn't the fault of any of the actors. I have since read that the studio forced the director to veer from his original version of the film. So, then, imagine if ""Pan's Labyrinth"" had a child with ""Street Kings"" and you've got this movie. There are certain genres that don't blend well together and this, unfortunately, is the perfect example.",1499385600,2,827,4.363636363636363
7601113,1,B01AHK50AC,"This is the worst movie ever. I am a huge lover of almost all things Keanu reeves for their aloof, seemingly unintended atrocities that somehow almost end up working. At least, they usually don't make you want to break your tv.

This will want to make you break your tv.",1494288000,,270,4.4
7601114,5,B01AHK50AC,"This movie took a long time to get there, but it is a beautiful metaphor for how our subconscious protects us.

7601115,1,B01AHK50AC,"On my personal scale of five movie judgment levels (1. Awesome, 2. Good, 3. Okay, 4. Bad, 5.

I will add though that Exposed is not too far behind those other films in the (God Awful) category and that is a legit ""NOT TOO FAR BEHIND"".",1493251200,2,336,4.029850746268656
7601116,4,B01AHK50AC,"Beautifully constructed, with two linked stories: a police detective (Keanu Reeves) investigates his partner's murder, and a young woman (Ana de Armas, in a luminous performance) faces emotional upheaval.

Virtually no humor, and some violence; the R rating is warranted.

Don't watch the video here at Amazon called ""Exposed: Keanu Reeves On His Character."" He gives away far too much of the plot.

This film has stayed with me since I saw it a couple of weeks ago.

The story: suffered under the weight of its own self-importance and never fully explained itself. Instead, it appeared to substitute plot--that of a poorly thought out cop picture--with a meager recreation of Jacob's Ladder with none of the crescendo, characters, or hair raising cuts.

7601204,2,B01AHK50AC,"Of great interest in considering the failure of this film, the following is about the director: Declan Dale is a pseudonym used much in the way that the name Alan Smithee was used for films that a director has disowned. Dale's only film is Exposed, a Keanu Reeves thriller that was significantly edited by Lionsgate Premiere without the original director's permission. The film, originally titled Daughter of God, was a surreal bi-lingual drama, reminiscent of Pan's Labyrinth and Irreversible, that focused on child abuse, violence towards women, mass incarceration, and police violence committed under the color of authority. However, the executives at Lionsgate Premiere thought they had been sold a Keanu Reeves cop-thriller. To increase the film's potential box office, during the editing process Lionsgate changed the story's focus to center on Reeves' character, and changed the movie into a generic crime-thriller. The director disowned the film, using the pseudonym of Declan Dale. And apparently the same situation occurred with the writer Gee Malik Linton, as they are the same person!

Perhaps that is the explanation we need when we wonder how a film can be so scrambled with any sense of character development or meaning. The plot synopsis attempts to make sense of the story: Detective Galban (Keanu Reeves), finds his partner and close friend, Detective Cullen, murdered in an underground subway. On the hunt for the killer/s, Galban begins to suspect his partner may have been heavily involved in drug dealing and police corruption. As Galban investigates, people who knew Cullen, are conveniently found dead. The closer Galban gets to the truth, both Cullen's wife, Janine (Mira Sorvino), and his Lieutenant (Christopher McDonald), try to persuade him to back off, fearing his findings may discredit Cullen and expose corruption within the Police Department. Galban's only remaining lead is Isabel ((Ana de Armas), a young, devout, Latino girl, who resides with her in-laws. Galban fears her life could be in jeopardy should he get too close to her. However, Isabel has recently experienced something not from this world, something mystical that she believes is truly a miracle. Not unlike Galban, Isabel is dealing with her own demons from the past; a past that just may lead them to the truth...

Yes, the film is artsy and that usually is a plus  looming otherworldly spirits that alter the storyline, indecipherable conversations despite constant subtitles, etc  but in the end the film has been too manipulated by too many people and the result is  - confused.

7601242,1,B01AHK50AC,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I didn't think it could possibly happen, but it did: Lionsgate has handed me the Worst Movie of 2016 (so far). The film is EXPOSED, and it stars Keanu Reeves and Ana de Armas, two actors I usually enjoy onscreen. What makes this situation even more sad is that the film could have been mesmerizing. Unfortunately, this is a scenario where the executives at the film company thought they knew better than the director. The result is a garbled mess of a film that is a massive waste of time and money.

If you don't recognize the directors name, don't be surprised; its not a real name. Its used as a way to shield the original director from the travesty the film company edited together. According to IMDB, here is the directors bio:

Declan Dale is a pseudonym used much in the way that the name Alan Smithee was used for films that a director has disowned. Dales only film is Exposed, a Keanu Reeves thriller that was significantly edited by Lionsgate Premiere without the original directors permission. The film, originally titled DAUGHTER OF GOD, was a surreal bi-lingual drama, reminiscent of PANS LABYRINTH and IRREVERSIBLE, that focused on child abuse, violence towards women, mass incarceration, and police violence committed under the color of authority. However, the executives at Lionsgate Premiere thought they had been sold a Keanu Reeves cop-thriller. To increase the films potential box office, during the editing process Lionsgate changed the storys focus to center on Reeves character, and changed the movie into a generic crime-thriller. The director disowned the film, using the pseudonym of Declan Dale.

This pretty much says everything you need to know about EXPOSED. If you watch it, youll feel like you're viewing two separate films that were spliced together. Theres no coherency in the plot, and thus, no entertainment value at all.

I read online that Keanu Reeves character was supposed to be a secondary and lesser figure in the film; the primary focus was supposed to be Ana de Armas and her plight. Shifting gears and trying to use a lesser character as the main destroyed the plotline and therefore fractured my viewing experience. I am stunned this film was even released; it should have been scrapped.

EXPOSED is a huge NO for me, and I cannot recommend it. The original concept of the film sounds like it would have been interesting and fun. But instead, thanks to the quest for the almighty dollar, we are given a poor excuse for a film. It is available now, if you decide to take a look.",1459728000,,2598,4.787946428571429

The deceased cop's wife, played with excellence by Mira Sorvino, rants and raves about her ""good"" husband, then she seduces her husband's best friend. There is a child involved, and that was indeed emotional. There are also guys you wouldn't want to encounter. The movie was actually switching scenes frequently, too often, in my opinion.

His wife (Mira Sorvino) proclaims, ""Joey was no choir boy."" Meanwhile Isabel (Ana de Armas) who is connected to one of the suspects is having visions. Her husband is in Iraq as she says the rosary daily for him. As time goes on, the over clued mystery open up.

Keanu Reeves played a very bland character. They could have hired Christian Slater to do the part and saved some money. He was snooze-fest boring and not well developed. Isabel was an interesting up lifting person, eerily saintly in her actions helping the poor and children.

This is a crime drama you can wait to see.

7601282,1,B01AHK50AC,"Wow... I don't even know where to begin this was so bad.

First, even though it is set in New York, easily 1/2 this film is in Spanish with subtitles.  If you don't want to spend 50 min reading subtitles, do yourself a favor and move along.

The directing, the acting, and especially the editing... made this movie nearly impossible to watch, impossible to follow, and basically complete crap.  My husband and I both enjoy Keanu Reeves (even though, let's face it, he will probably never win an Oscar for his acting skills) and we both like cop action/dramas so this looked like a good bet.  Watched the trailer, it looked ""ok"" so we took the plunge.  Ugh!  I was not prepared for the supernatural element which was not even hinted at in the trailer or synopsis.

SPOILER ALERT: It starts out straight-forward enough, Galban (Reeves) is looking for his partner's killer.  Then, out of the blue, we are following Isabel (de Armas) as she meanders through her seemingly mundane life peppered with some unexplained supernatural oddities that seem like they may be just in her mind (but you really aren't quite sure) and which seem to have started on the same subway platform on which the officer was killed... (or is it the same platform?)... on the same day... (or was it the same day?) You just really don't know and they don't allude to it well enough to be able to tell.  You don't even get that satisfaction of figuring it all out.  You just feel confused.

Scene changes are awkward and badly timed. At one point, we were convinced that we'd skipped over a part of the movie.  At oddly regular intervals, the scene jumps from Reeves to De Armas with no rhyme or reason, no explanation, no way to understand how the two might be related until it's revealed that she is in a surveillance photo with some gang members?  How is this relevant?  We don't know. Later, he is staking out a building from which she emerges. Don't know how this is relevant either.  Then, Reeves states that he hasn't picked up the girl for questioning because she would likely be killed... Why?  We don't know.  And that's pretty much how the movie continues.  Characters are introduced, but then you never really know who they are or how they are related.  A stuffed horse is introduced in an obvious attempt to draw some symbolism, but again, the horse is never explained.  Mira Sorvino (as the dead cop's wife) is alloted even less character development and adds absolutely nothing to the story.  In fact, it seemed that her part was added only to allow for a little sexual content.

The film alludes to the fact that Isabel is living with her in-laws and that her husband/fiance/boyfriend (we aren't told) has been doing military service in Iraq for some time  So, we really weren't sure why, this seemingly intelligent woman, thought it would be a good idea to announce that she was pregnant, in the middle of a family dinner with her in-laws, and then claim it was the immaculate conception.  Come on... even if it was an immaculate conception (it was not), no one with a brain cell in their head would make such a pronouncement at a family dinner with the in-laws just days after her husband (their son/brother/uncle) has died.

It took me about 1/2 the movie to figure out the supernatural stuff was in Isabel's head.  Another 1/4 of the movie to confirm that she was somehow related to the cop's death, and it wasn't until the last 5 minutes that everything is kind of dumped on you and ""sorted out"".  Basically, they took a really shallow, short story, and attempted in some way to make it like this big mystery -- like it would be so exciting when all was revealed -- when in fact, we were so confused and irriated at that point, we really didn't even care. Talk about making a complete hash of it and vomiting it all over an unsuspecting public.

I can only hope that my review will keep other people from wasting their time.  If you have 102 minutes to spare... there are WAY better choices out there.",1454889600,14,3991,4.564606741573034

7601300,4,B01AHK50AC,"I don't know the history of this film, and maybe I don't want to. Ana De Armas plays a young woman in a poor Puerto Rican (?) community who has both horrific life experiences and visions. She sees weird events and ghosts follow her. She is very kind to children. The film really nails the mixed up Puerto Rican/black sub-culture layered with heavy Catholic motifs. Keanu Reeves is a traumatized veteran cop investigating the murder of his partner. The more he digs, the worse it gets as his partner was into every sort of corruption. Meanwhile, his partner's widow (Mira Sorvino) wants Reeves to a) find the killer b) protect his pension, and c) as if a) and b) are not enough, screw her.  Sorvino, who apparently won something for something, chews scenery like it was her last meal and doesn't match at all with the moody and subtle tone of the film. I'd like to tell you this was a good film, but it's not. The writing cheats a lot, though the acting is excellent. Reeves nails the part of the burnt cop with the bad haircut and a kid he can't talk to. Trouble is his character doesn't have much to do, and the film ends just when  you think it is going to get its' sh*t together. Apparently there is a director's cut floating around. I will re-post if I can find it and it resolves some of these issues. Finally, if you are attracted to the style and mood of this film, you will like some much better films by Johnny To, ""Vengeance"" and ""Exiled"" are two of them. I dream of Keanu working with To, who works with his own crew pretty much but made ""Vengeance"" with the French singer Johnny Hallyday (who is an astonishingly good actor).
