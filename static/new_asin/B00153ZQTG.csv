8257438,1,B00153ZQTG,"To portray Detroit as some death trap is just awful.  I was born and raised in the Detroit, and my parents were here in the 50's, and they have said, to me, It was not bad like that, and they grew up in Black bottom and the east side.  Music was in the air and love.  However in the 80's which was my time, I remember YBI, and yes they were ruthless, but we had good times too.  Family was still there, and jobs, so tell the whole story, I'm tired of the bad rap in Detroit. We may not have all the finances, but we have heart.",1298937600,,527,3.8518518518518516
8257439,5,B00153ZQTG,"This documentary of Detroit is SO very concise and painstakingly thorough in its' expose' of Detroits'environ,that anyone viewing it will quickly begin to comprehend the sheer(obscene)level of murder,mayhem and violence that transpires in Detroit on an everyday basis..

8257440,3,B00153ZQTG,"i got this dvd to use for reference and hoped that it had details of many of the major crimes that had taken place in detroit, especially since the 1970's.  i didn't find it very detailed.  it was rather slap dash with many of the stories, particularly in more recent times.  when there were words to be read on screen, they came and went so quickly, you had to rewind a couple of times just to read what was said.  this dvd is amatuerish, including the sensationalistic voice over.  it is good for a single viewing.  expensive too, for what you get.",1284249600,,550,4.3431372549019605
8257441,5,B00153ZQTG,"I grew up on 7 mile & Kelly in the 70's & 80's and to this day wouldnt have changed a thing about my childhood. I went to Denby HS and worked afternoons at the market on Hayes and Troester. It was a tough place, you were always at risk, but you learned how to survive. You knew not to wear your new Jordans or Max Julian to Eastland unless you had 3 or 4 of your boys with you.  I once got robbed for a gold chain by a older kid with an attack dog just on Bishop and E Warren. Come to find out it was a police dog and it was a cops kid, the younger brother knew me and gave my chain back.  We didn't even tell anybody it happened, it was just teenage life in the D.  This movie took me back to the days of hearing about YBI and all those dudes. I remember hearing about an incident on the Boblo boat, and there was always talk about the Guardian Angels in town but neither was mentioned in this docu.  I loved the film, great clips... I think I saw some Bill Bonds in there.  I moved to Cali in 1990, but I still think about the D everyday",1228176000,3,1039,3.813953488372093
8257442,3,B00153ZQTG,"I grew up in the Detroit during the 50's, 60's, part of the 70's.  i would recommend it for anyone who grew up in that era.  i enjoyed the footage shown from that time-it brought back memories.  if anything, the makers of this film could do a film on each of the subjects mentioned in the film-it's an overview but it's like you get a tantalizing bite of a topic and then they move on.  one topic they mention-the death of a persian gulf vet named riggs.  they make his murder sound like part of a social problems of detroit when actually he was murdred by those closest to him-his wife and her brother.  that could have happened anywhere and i am surprised they did not mention the outcome in the film.  other than that, it was interesting.",1214784000,2,741,4.326086956521739
