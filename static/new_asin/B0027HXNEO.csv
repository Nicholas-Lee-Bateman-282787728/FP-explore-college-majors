If you're sensitive to this sort of thing (alas, I am), you might want to see if your local library is willing to buy this so you don't have to pay $24 for a DVD with bad sound.",1503964800,,320,4.161290322580645
8354723,5,B0027HXNEO,"Please ignore the negative comments about the sound and picture. There is nothing wrong with this DVD. The original camera work isn't the best, but this was clearly shot as an archival video by a camera operator who wasn't as familiar with the presentation has he perhaps should have been. The sound is perfectly fine for a live theatrical event. What's important here is the content -And what wonderful content it is! Quentin Crisp performed this one-man show off and on for over twenty years, captured here in 1999 only a few months before his untimely passing at the age of 90. Twenty years ago, when I bought the audio recording of Mr. Crisp doing this show in New York I found it highly amusing, but I doubted both the sincerity and the accuracy of what he was saying. Now that I am older I realize just how sincere (and how right) Mr. Crisp was. Whatever your age Quentin Crisp will make you laugh and make you think. And the more you think, the more you'll laugh.",1394841600,2,970,4.4858757062146895
8354724,5,B0027HXNEO,"I should say firstly that I found this DVD to be of perfectly good watching (and listening) quality.  It is apparently filmed by a camcorder which zooms in very occasionally to the details of Mr Crisp's appearance but as the focus of his show is on his words and delivery overall this filming method works well.

Mr Crisp gives a fine performance of his one-man show.  There have been audio and DVD recordings of his show in the past but now that he is no longer with us there is a moving quality to this performance filmed as it was in the last year of his life.

Mr Crisp's rejection of (sexual) relationships is I believe a somewhat tragic aspect of his life but one that does not feature heavily in this performance.  By contrast he does explain clearly the wonderfully positive core to his philosophy: that of identifying, clarifying and presenting one's ideal self to the world as a means to happiness and fulfilment which also has the effect of enriching the quality of life of everyone with whom the stylist comes into contact.

This DVD will have just that effect on its viewers.",1332633600,,1088,4.553846153846154
8354725,3,B0027HXNEO,"THIS DVD IS RECORDED FROM THE AUDIENCE ON A HOME VIDEO RECORDER...THE SOUND QUALITY IS REALLY TERRIBLE!!...HOWEVER THIS PROBABLY IS ONE OF THE LAST PERFORMANCES OF QUENTINS LIFE AND IS WORTH WATCHING ANYWAYS!!,IF YOU CAN TOLLERATE THE SOUND QUALITY THAT IS!!..",1327881600,2,260,5.365853658536586
8354726,5,B0027HXNEO,"This is the only DVD of Quentin Crisp's 'An Evening With...'. I've seen a different one, broadcast here in England while he was still with us but unfortunately doesn't seem to have been  preserved. So to find this was a joy. OK, there are one or two odd camera angles and the sound indicates it was recorded during a live performance but the picture quality is good and he comes across as the wise, wonderful, eccentric and loveable man he was. Without him the world is a rather smaller, colder place.",1305676800,2,501,4.5054945054945055
8354727,4,B0027HXNEO,"So good to see Quentin Crisp is typically enrapturing form. Words of wisdom and amusing anecdotes, full of self-deprecating wit and immense style. BUT... the camerawork is the worst I've ever seen on any video: jerky, often too close and so irritating I had to stop watching.",1296172800,5,275,4.872340425531915
8354728,1,B0027HXNEO,"I was astonished at how poor the sound quality was on this DVD.
I have bought many DVDs and CDs from Amazon over the years and this is the only one that was so badly recorded that I felt it was unwatchable
It sounded like an amateur effort from the front row of the stalls.",1261267200,7,273,3.981818181818182
8354729,5,B0027HXNEO,"Quentin Crisp was never better than in this late appearance (at 90, in January 1999, the last year of his life) for which we can thank L. Brandon Krall for having so skillfully captured in this dvd. He states his mission at the outset: to cure us of our freedom, which he eloquently and hilariously thereafter explains is the root of all anguish. The sharp Caravaggio darks and lights with which Ms. Krall dramatically frames Mr. Crisp's face photographically add to an overall sense here that we're receiving the distillation of a remarkable life, deliberately and richly offered up as his final gift to us. His grace & unsentimentality & searingly clear if provocative takes on ""how to be happy"" will remain with you for a very long time. Do avail yourself of it.
