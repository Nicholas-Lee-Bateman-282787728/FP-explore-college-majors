6729550,3,B00O9NA6RQ,"The stories on this tape were focused on people with cancer. I hoped to share it with my mother who is healthy but had just lost her husband and is 90 years old herself, but didn't feel it was uplifting enough. The questions raised for use in preparation for death were helpful for my own notes.",1428969600,3,295,4.285714285714286
6729551,4,B00O9NA6RQ,Well done.,1421884800,4,10,4.5
6729552,5,B00O9NA6RQ,I saw part of this video on public television and had to purchase my own copy.  I have given to my physician to view but you don't have to be a doctor to learn from this wonderful documentary.  I suggest that everyone view it.,1421452800,6,226,4.113636363636363
6729553,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"Having worked in hospice for the last 27 years, I truly appreciate what Michael and Terry have done to raise awareness and encourage people to have these crucial conversations with family and their physicians. Studies still show that physicians are not consistently having these conversations with their patients; this results in the patient's wishes NOT being honored at the end of life. This is an unnecessary tragedy for the patient and the family who live, not only with the grief of losing a loved one, but also the guilt of denying their loved one the peaceful death he/she desired. This is a masterful contribution to the issue of end-of-life care in this country.",1416700800,6,671,4.946902654867257
6729554,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"It's a genuine privilege to be able to see such a weighty topic be thoughtfully dissected with nuance, intelligence, and compassion. As a HUGE fan of the first CONSIDER THE CONVERSATION I had high hopes for the second... and it came shining through to meet and exceed every last one bit of my expectations. Yes, it's a delicate subject but the filmmakers never waver from treating it as such. We see dignity, respect, people facing hard choices and a medical profession having to look at the hard ruth that they do not know all the answers. The fact that it might touch a few nerves in viewers is to be expected - this isn't a Pixar cartoon - but I think for this who want to see in-depth issues explored with credibility and equanimity, this film is a can't miss.",1462752000,,764,4.464285714285714
6729555,5,B00O9NA6RQ,Delighted and honored to engage with Mike and Terry in the concept behind this and in contributing. They have really captured the essence of the issues and provide an wonderful vehicle to generate discussion!,1462752000,,208,5.147058823529412
6729556,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"While end of life conversations are difficult, they are insight, too.  Michael Bernhagen has devoted his life's work to these conversations uncovering inspirational stories of personal journeys and a clear understanding of the medical teams role.  This DVD is perfect to evolve personal conversations or group discussions.  Really excellent for any age.",1462752000,,353,5.75
6729557,5,B00O9NA6RQ,This documentary explores why the end-of-care patients receive differs from the care physicians choose for themselves. Anxious to see Consider the Conversation 3!,1462752000,,162,6.086956521739131
6729558,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"The film presents a compelling set of stories about the importance of high quality communication.  It's rich with a variety of viewpoints including patients and physicians at their most vulnerable.  This comes cross as a real story - not a scrubbed version of reality.  We see how doctors struggle with caring for people with serious illness and how those same patients struggle.  It's quite unique, they have actual footage from inside real patient/doctor encounters and you can see for yourself what happens.  It leaves you with lots to think about.",1462752000,,551,5.0777777777777775
6729559,5,B00O9NA6RQ,This is one of the most poignant documentaries on this topic I have ever seen.  The way the producers capture the intimate moments of so many people facing the struggles of serious illness is truly touching.  This is a much watch for any person facing a serious illness or their caregiver/loved one.,1462752000,,299,4.730769230769231
6729560,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"There is such a powerful message contained within this documentary - have the conversation about the end of life within your family AND publically. As a community, we need to stop hiding in the closet, hoping that death won't find us. This piece does a great job at bringing to light some of the personal and profession barriers we face in America and offers some solutions leaders in the field have found.",1462752000,,406,4.652777777777778
6729561,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"This film is absolutely wonderful.  It showcases an area of healthcare that is quite often misunderstood or rather, skipped over completely, due to either lack of knowledge or general discomfort.  I work in healthcare and wish there were more films like this one out there for the general public.  Throughout the course of the film you will laugh, you will cry, and you will feel empowered by the information presented so eloquently.  Consider the Conversation 1 was fantastic and I feel that this second one is even better in some ways.  Hopefully this duo will be able to produce more documentaries on subjects, like this one, that are often difficult to discuss, think about, and put into practice in our daily lives.  It is an eye opening collection of stories that will leave you all feeling more in touch with your humanity.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1462752000,3,849,4.854166666666667
6729562,1,B00O9NA6RQ,"After seeing Consider the Conversation Part 1,  this one was very disappointing, especially since I bought the education license to use for community education on advance directives and MOLST.  The film runs way too long, and makes an abrupt shift from stories of ""cure and hope"" to suddenly talking about hospice.  Puts out some mixed messages from physicians:  ""don't tell the patient that they are dying so that they don't lose hope"",  to tell them so"" they can make the most of their remaining days"" via hospice.  Showed this to several physicians that I work with and they were not fans of this having also viewed part one.",1456876800,,628,4.768518518518518
6729563,4,B00O9NA6RQ,helpful even for hospice volunteers to watch. Good insight into the dying process.,1437091200,2,82,5.384615384615385
8682681,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"Watching this video let me know that it's okay to initiate a conversation of death and dying with my elderly parents.  Not that my family considers it taboo, but it just wasn't something that ever came up.  It made me realize they also need to talk to their doctor about their wishes and questions concerning  future health situations. Another realization is that even though my siblings and I will do our best to carry out their wishes and do what's best for our parents that we may have different interpretations of what that is.  This documentary is real and informative.",1463875200,,574,4.71
8682682,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"As a psychiatrist and co-leader of a local meditation group, I chose to screen this documentary for our group in follow up to its predecessor.  CC2 skillfully confronts the challenges physicians face in dealing with a most difficult point in a patient's journey, revealing the disparities that exist within Western medicine in how to approach these conversations.  The documentary has prompted us to form a group we've titled ""Continuing the Conversation"" so as to sort through these issues for ourselves.",1463788800,,505,5.3
8682683,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"Consider the Conversation 2 is another high-quality film that follows in the footsteps of the equally wonderful film Consider the Conversation: A Documentary about a Taboo Subject. I have shown this film to local community-based audiences numerous times, and each time the participants comment about how thought-provoking the film is, how much they learned -- and how now they really now ""get"" why thinking about advance care planning is so important, and about they want to learn more about advocating for their loved ones within our medical system. They not only find the film itself to be a great viewing experience, but they feel moved to take action -- to have the conversation with loved ones and family members. And that's what it's all about folks, right?
The film touches the viewer with its authenticity as it goes to the heart of the matter about what needs fixing with our medical system in the U.S. right now. Through the heartfelt stories of real people - patients, family members, physicians and other health care providers - we learn, we laugh, we tear up. And then - at least down here in Durham - we ask ""so now what are we gonna do about it?""",1463702400,,1161,4.724137931034483
8682684,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"Building on the excellent first volume, this film examines the doctor-patient relationship beyond the clinical realm, in a way that is calm and empathetic. This documentary is educational and moving.",1463529600,,199,5.666666666666667
8682685,5,B00O9NA6RQ,Mike and his team do a great job sharing with the world the importance of this topic!  Highly recommend this film!,1463011200,,114,4.428571428571429
8682686,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"This movie is a ""must see"" for EVERYONE, not just clinically trained.  Very sensitively created to address a very sensitive subject that will touch us all one day. Better to discuss and prepare in advance then to wait until you or your family is in crisis mode.  Michael and Terry both have personal reasons to want to spread this message and have done so with professionalism and from the heart.  Don't delay seeing this, and when you are finished, share it with family and friends to help raise awareness of how important it is to think about and prepare as best you can, for end of life decisions.  Your family will thank you for it.",1462752000,,636,4.504347826086956
8682687,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"This topic is difficult to discuss and both the first Consider the Conversation and this second one are excellent!  Michael and Terry did an amazing job of gathering experts in the field and share compelling stories on end of life issues.  These both are amazing, heartfelt and compelling.  All physicians and others who work with death and dying should see this.  As a former nursing home administrator, I highly recommend them both.",1462752000,,434,4.986111111111111
8682688,5,B00O9NA6RQ,There is a profound lack of understanding about supportive care at the end of life and few places to learn what we need to know.  Consider the Conversation 2 is a visual blog that interviews compassionate and wise professionals and the patients they serve.  Everyone wants more meaningful and honest information about how to live life well through the end of life. This film is a fine place to access plenty of both.,1462752000,,416,4.684931506849315
8682689,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"As a former Hospice Administrator who actively engaged the community in an effort to enlighten, to educate, and ultimately to change lives, I highly recommend this video.",1462752000,,170,5.333333333333333
8682690,5,B00O9NA6RQ,"Oh, if only we all could 1) see this film and 2) follow through with the concept, the end of life would be dramatically changed for the better.",1462752000,,143,4.142857142857143
