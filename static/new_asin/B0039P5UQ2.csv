8392234,1,B0039P5UQ2,"I agree that Domingo must not have known what he was doing, any more than the A list actors who participated in a CALIGULA by Guccione years ago who thought they were in a legitimate historical epic, and found themselves in a porno movie!  As others have said, this film takes a completely NAZI interpretation of PARSIFAL, mixes it with all kinds of theological questions about the problem of evil and suffering, and concludes with horrible and sickening images of African and other starving and abused children all around the world.  Is Palmer urging compassion, a la PARSIFAL, or is he criticizing ""God"" for the suffering in the world, as the excerpts from Bergmann's SEVENTH SEAL suggest?  There is no organization to the film.  We have an amateurishly filmed outdoor sequence from PARSIFAL (which IS good for laughs) combined with the Mariinsky opera performance, well done but badly filmed.  The film is narrow minded, poorly organized and sickening.  The same sequence from the Richard Burton mini series about the burning of the Dresden Opera house is repeated over and over, to what end? Many people who are famous speak well of Palmer, but he must have in a rage of Wagner hating when he produced this horrible, disorganized film.  Stay away from this at all costs.  I'm aware of Wagner's dark side, and I deplore it; but to reduce him to nothing but a proto-Nazi, responsible for all the suffering in the world is an outrage!",1361836800,8,1435,4.804878048780488
8392235,4,B0039P5UQ2,"The only reason I stopped at four stars was that I felt Palmer could have made this a little shorter and tighter. But maybe you won't think that; after all, if you're watching it you are probably a person who loves Wagner.

I've always found Wagner's Christian operas (Parsifal, Lohengrin, Tannhauser) difficult to embrace. I suppose I'm a bit like Nietszche that way. Palmer has not made me love Parsifal, but he's succeeded in helping me get a grip on it. He's not shy about making some moral and artistic judgments about the subject matter -- but that's part of the package. There is plenty here for people interested simply in the performance, in the history of the work, in Wagner's career and, to some extent, in scholarship of the Grail legend (which is a subject academics have drowned in). If you are interested in opera as a vehicle of meaning, versus just some lovely music and spectacle, I think you will like this.",1355529600,,927,4.652439024390244
8392236,1,B0039P5UQ2,"This review is from: Wagner - Parsifal (The Story of the Opera) (DVD)

While Domingo certainly knows this opera, he could not possibly know what he was getting involved in.
The producers present an unbalanced and distorted view of the themes of Parsifal, especially Redemption through Compassion, by obsessing over Hitler's response to Wagner's works. No one here bothers to mention that the Nazis BANNED Parsifal from all German opera houses, including Bayreuth, in 1939 because they couldn't reconcile its message with their own. But there is an awful lot of blather about purity and blood which I dare you to show me in the opera's text. I've translated every word myself, including the stage directions. Much of the music and imagery used comes from Die Gotterdammerung, without saying so. Even if you can't read German, there are plenty of good translations available, and a few good books, too, about this opera.
Read something, and leave garbage like this to the landfills.",1351641600,10,980,5.049382716049383
