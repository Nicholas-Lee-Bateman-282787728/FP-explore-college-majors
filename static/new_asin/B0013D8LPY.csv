3103186,4,B0013D8LPY,"I was interested in seeing these scooby doo episodes. I had not seen them previously. I am pretty sure anyway. That vampire one seemed slightly familiar. I had not seen a single richie rich cartoon prior to viewing this set. So, what do i think about the material on this set. Well, i found the richie rich episodes to be boring and cliched. I bought this set for scooby and it does not disappoint in that regard. Most of the scooby episodes are great. I have found that after the original series, the best reincarnations are like this. Shaggy, scooby, and scrappy going on 7 minute adventures of various types. I recommend seeing some of the episodes in the series after this which also have the trio go on 7 minute adventures. It is called the scooby and scrappy puppy hour. The episode who's scooby doo is great. The story entails shaggy and scooby getting their personalities switched and being in each others body and struggling to return to themselves after the machine that changed them is swiped by a couple bullies.",1463270400,,1024,4.631868131868132

3103224,5,B0013D8LPY,"I have never been a big fan of Richie Rich, Casper or the rest of the Harveytoons stable of characters. So had the Scooby Doo and Richie Rich cartoons been released separately I would never had bought or watched the Richie Rich cartoons in this set.

And I would have been the poorer for it. I watched these as a kid and they are still enjoyable(ish) today.

And as much as I was annoyed at the inclusion of Scrappy Doo at the time, these are great Scooby cartoons, and a lot of fun.

I hope Warner Bros gets around to releasing volumes 2 and 3 soon, as well as the rest of the Scooby Doo Show cartoons from Dynomutt and Laff-A-Lympics and also the Scooby. I do love the new episodes created for the 13 Spooky Tales releases that include ""lost episodes"", but it sucks to have to buy titles like Spookiest Tales and Winter Wonder Dog to get a single episode each not already in a better collection.",1419984000,,897,4.295857988165681

3103253,3,B0013D8LPY,"Warner Bros needs to finish what it starts and release the complete series.  It's frustrating to only get one third of something (i.e. Richie Rich/Scooby Doo Show ran for 2 seasons with 21 total episodes. This Volume 1 DVD only contains 7 of those 21 shows).  WB has to consider who their target audience is.  Most people who collect sets like these are fans of the show and want more than just part of Season 1.

I'm sure that sales figures and costs are the main driver behind whether they decide to release a second, third, or fourth set of DVD's.  With shows like the Flintstones you get all 6 seasons.  With the Smurfs you get Season 1, and then 60 percent of season two, and nothing of the 8 seasons after that.  I can see that costs exceed profits if you don't have high enough demand for a show that runs 10 seasons - like the Smurfs.  However, with the Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo show, they really only need to release one or two more volumes (14 more episodes) to complete the series.  They could probably do it cheaper with one volume that has double sided discs.  You would think that they would make the extra effort to satisfy their customers, even if it means narrower profit margins.  I would think that if complete series were released for all of the H-B shows, that sales would be higher than they are for just Volume 1's of everything.  Furthermore, why label something as ""Volume 1"" if there is nothing to follow?  That is kind of misleading to consumers, leading them to believe that if they purchase an item that they can expect to get more of that series in the future.  If you are not planning on releasing the rest of the series, then don't call it ""Volume 1"".  I understand the numbers behind your decisions, but consumer satisfaction is something that you are not considering.  Please WB, go the extra mile and finish the series !!!",1328313600,20,1855,4.492537313432836
3103254,4,B0013D8LPY,"Before I yak on, I'd like to say the episodes here were wonderfully remastered (much better than prints I've seen on the internet and television). Secondly, I really only bought this DVD for Scooby. Not that it's not nice having a bit of Richie for myself, but Scooby was my main priority.
Now to the cons: First off, the episodes are out of order. REALLY, out of order. It was like they just threw random segments all over the place and just put that together. Also, there isn't a specific play episode selection (well, there is, but it's only for the separate shorts, not the full 40-something minute episode altogether). I was really hoping for an organized, COMPLETE SERIES set (I won't get into that because other reviews already have), and I ended up with this. And when and if they ever release a 'volume two', I hope more of an effort would be put that than here. Oh, well.",1316736000,8,881,4.5125
3103255,5,B0013D8LPY,All i can say is that the dvds are great. I bought it cause i only wanted richie rich but the scooby doo episodes are still good to watch even if you only want richie rich.

3103269,3,B0013D8LPY,"I purchased this two-disc DVD set for my eight-year-old daughter. She likes it, but she was diappointed that this ""rare"" show DOES NOT have Richie Rich and Scooby together on mystery-solving adventures. The descriptions on the box led us to believe that this was a show where Richie and Scooby actually teamed up. Sadly, it's not. It's just a series of short cartoons, alternating between Richie Rich and Scooby-Doo, each in their own separate cartoon story lines. Despite this disappointment, my daughter does enjoy these silly cartoons. Admittedly, they do not do much for me because I never got into Richie Rich and these Scooby adventures include (ugghh) Scappy-Dappy-Doo.

and is worth the price of the DVD.

3103273,4,B0013D8LPY,"I suppose I'll write the first review now that the product has actually been released.  I consider myself a child of the 80s, although this 1980 series pre-dates my ability to remember the original airing by at least a couple of years.  However, having watched the set I recognize several of the episodes from later syndication and remember enjoying these a lot.

We have here two dual-layer (no double-sided) DVDs.  The contents are divided into individual Richie Rich and Scooby Doo show segments, ranging from 7 to 12 minutes in length.  Extra short Richie Rich ""Gem"" segments are appended to the end of the previous cartoon and are not listed in the menu.  The cartoons from each hour episode are presented in sequential order in the menu.  There is the ever-present ""Play All"" option, but there doesn't appear to be a way to select and play full hour episodes.  The first cartoon from each episode has the original opening sequence, including mixed theme music and mixed animation of Richie and Scooby characters.  The last cartoon from each hour has two separate closing credits in sequence -- not sure if one or both are original.

The cartoons pertaining to each hour episode are listed on the inside cover of the DVD jacket.  The Richie cartoons do not appear to have title cards, just generic ""Riches"", ""Treasure Chest"" and ""Zillion-Dollar Adventures"" segment titles, so the actual cartoon titles are only visible in the menu and the jacket, and where they come from is anyone's guess (syndication titles maybe?).

I find the Richie Rich cartoons to be rather fun.  The character designs are improved slightly from the comic book and Richie seems a bit older.  I'm not otherwise familiar with the comic books or their stories, but the cartoon features adventures with Richie foiling crooks and solving problems, often with the help of his many wonderful gadgets and technology.  There is his robot maid Irona, who can seemingly turn into anything, and the endless assortment of gadgets and gizmos provided by Professor Keenbean.  The optimistic and unapologetic inclusion of so much gadgetry and fanciful technology is fun to watch.  The animation is as good or better than most any H-B series, although the backgrounds are a little flat and the cartoon often resembles a side-scrolling game.  However, Richie's world is bright and colorful and the action is fairly non-stop.  Gloria's voice has a few Bart Simpson moments, but otherwise usually sounds like a young girl.  I think kids today would still enjoy this cartoon immensely.

Then there are the Scooby Doo segments.  Yes they have Scrappy.  While far from my favorite character, in this early entry he's not THAT bad.  I think some kind of third wheel was necessary to pull off this less (to use the term loosely) cerebral incarnation of Scooby Doo.  Scrappy Doo is the catalyst that usually gets Shaggy and Scooby into trouble, followed by lots of fearful whimpering and running scared.  The episodes are a short 7 minutes.  Villains are often real monsters with real supernatural powers.  There are no explanations, no mystery solving, no unmasking some phony in a costume.  The stories are action packed and are meant to entertain with the non-stop comic antics of Shaggy and Scooby, running around scared out of their wits and trying to escape while keeping Scrappy from getting them into even more trouble.  The short running times keep them watchable.  They certainly seem targeted toward a younger audience than earlier Scooby Doo adventures, and would likely still be entertaining to younger children.

I'd say Warner Brothers did a better job on this release than some previous efforts.  If this is the quality we can expect with these slimmer 2-disc Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection sets then I'm reasonably satisfied.  Here's hoping more volumes come out with all the rest of Richie Rich and many other H-B properties still waiting in the wings.",1211587200,22,3925,4.987692307692308
3103274,4,B0013D8LPY,"Richie Rich was a great favorite of mine as a kid. And I still enjoy it when the Boomerang channel plays it (they once spent a 24 hour period playing RIchie Rich). Im not the only one, im actually suprised at the number of adults who count Boomerang as one of the only channels that make cable worth paying for. These H-B collections have been great and grant these shows a long life void of the deteriation that comes from VHS. There are so many things I am hoping for because I love so much of what H-B put out. Richie Rich is one im surprised took this long to come out. I personally do not recall the Scooby portion of this hour. Regardless I am buying this exclusively for the RIchie Rich cartoons. I would like information on the amount of time this box set has in it.

3103275,3,B0013D8LPY,"As a 1970s child (growing up on 1970s TV, of course) this is one of the *few* 1980s cartoons I have loads of fond memories of (minus the ""Scooby trio"" here, doing nothing but bungling and bumbling their way thru every ep. The original 1969 S-D had more class, more pizazz). Anyways, I grew up with BOTH the comic book as well as the cartoon, where I watched every ep. (religiously) and, let me say, it really knows how to stay true to the original (where you see Richie rescuing Gloria, or Reggie pulling one of his countless pranks, only to backfire on him, and so on). However, one main difference here also has the storylines of Jonny Quest with the quirky gadgets/inventions of the Jetsons mixed in (two earlier H-B creations).  Even Season 3, as I remember it, really had a LOT OF HEART.
One ep. shows Irona, the Riches' maid, wanting to try her hand at sports instead of just keeping house 24/7. Richie coaches her, only she ends up breaking one world record after another.  So, by the end, Irona does her ""weightlifting"" event, where she actually lifts heavy inanimate objects from the mansion (like a piano, a statue) with the Rich family and staff acting as judges, holding up score cards and applauding. Richie then hugs Irona and says ""These are the only critics you should listen to, Irona, people who love you the most!""  (Awww, how sweet and nothing sugary about it, either.)

Other eps. also have Richie and co. (namely Gloria and Dollar) trying to catch villains and crooks of every type out there, from ruthless bug-like space aliens, to eccentric oddballs, such as the Giggler and Mr. Dirty, and to the baddies straight out of the comic book pages, like the Onion, Dr. Disguise, and the Shocking Lady.  Richie manages to catch and nail every one them, with Dollar klutzing up in the end and providing comic relief as well.

I was eight when this came out in 1980, and it still holds true for me today: LOTS OF HEART, PLENTY OF ACTION AND FUN, AND JUST SO PHENOMENAL.
FORGET THE SCOOBY SEGMENTS: HERE, THE GANG HAS BEEN REDUCED DOWN TO A ""TRIO"" AND GOES SO FAR AS TO SHOW SOME EPS IN WONDERLAND OR THE LAND OZ.

Also, here's something else you all should know: this has its share of veteran cartoon voice actors (like Mr. Slate's John Stephenson in a few eps. from Seasons 2 & 3) as well as a few new up-and-comings just starting out in the business (Nancy Cartwright, who you all know does Bart Simpson, also does the voice of Gloria).",1207785600,6,2453,4.511261261261262

If you're a fan of Scooby-Doo, or the Hanna-Barbera library of cartoons, you'll definitely enjoy this selection. I'm only disappointed that  Warner Bros. Home Video has opted to go the ""Volume 1"" route instead of the ""Complete Series."" I assume that's to keep costs down since this was an hour-long show.

Lots of episodes to enjoy, don't miss it.",1433376000,,537,4.8478260869565215

3337721,5,B0013D8LPY,"I have never been a big fan of Richie Rich, Casper or the rest of the Harveytoons stable of characters. So had the Scooby Doo and Richie Rich cartoons been released separately I would never had bought or watched the Richie Rich cartoons in this set.

And I would have been the poorer for it. I watched these as a kid and they are still enjoyable(ish) today.

And as much as I was annoyed at the inclusion of Scrappy Doo at the time, these are great Scooby cartoons, and a lot of fun.

I hope Warner Bros gets around to releasing volumes 2 and 3 soon, as well as the rest of the Scooby Doo Show cartoons from Dynomutt and Laff-A-Lympics and also the Scooby. I do love the new episodes created for the 13 Spooky Tales releases that include ""lost episodes"", but it sucks to have to buy titles like Spookiest Tales and Winter Wonder Dog to get a single episode each not already in a better collection.",1419984000,,897,4.295857988165681

3337750,3,B0013D8LPY,"Warner Bros needs to finish what it starts and release the complete series.  It's frustrating to only get one third of something (i.e. Richie Rich/Scooby Doo Show ran for 2 seasons with 21 total episodes. This Volume 1 DVD only contains 7 of those 21 shows).  WB has to consider who their target audience is.  Most people who collect sets like these are fans of the show and want more than just part of Season 1.

I'm sure that sales figures and costs are the main driver behind whether they decide to release a second, third, or fourth set of DVD's.  With shows like the Flintstones you get all 6 seasons.  With the Smurfs you get Season 1, and then 60 percent of season two, and nothing of the 8 seasons after that.  I can see that costs exceed profits if you don't have high enough demand for a show that runs 10 seasons - like the Smurfs.  However, with the Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo show, they really only need to release one or two more volumes (14 more episodes) to complete the series.  They could probably do it cheaper with one volume that has double sided discs.  You would think that they would make the extra effort to satisfy their customers, even if it means narrower profit margins.  I would think that if complete series were released for all of the H-B shows, that sales would be higher than they are for just Volume 1's of everything.  Furthermore, why label something as ""Volume 1"" if there is nothing to follow?  That is kind of misleading to consumers, leading them to believe that if they purchase an item that they can expect to get more of that series in the future.  If you are not planning on releasing the rest of the series, then don't call it ""Volume 1"".  I understand the numbers behind your decisions, but consumer satisfaction is something that you are not considering.  Please WB, go the extra mile and finish the series !!!",1328313600,20,1855,4.492537313432836

Secondly, I really only bought this DVD for Scooby. Not that it's not nice having a bit of Richie for myself, but Scooby was my main priority.
Now to the cons: First off, the episodes are out of order. REALLY, out of order. It was like they just threw random segments all over the place and just put that together. Also, there isn't a specific play episode selection (well, there is, but it's only for the separate shorts, not the full 40-something minute episode altogether). I was really hoping for an organized, COMPLETE SERIES set (I won't get into that because other reviews already have), and I ended up with this. And when and if they ever release a 'volume two', I hope more of an effort would be put that than here. Oh, well.",1316736000,8,881,4.5125

The descriptions on the box led us to believe that this was a show where Richie and Scooby actually teamed up. Sadly, it's not. It's just a series of short cartoons, alternating between Richie Rich and Scooby-Doo, each in their own separate cartoon story lines. Despite this disappointment, my daughter does enjoy these silly cartoons.

3337770,4,B0013D8LPY,"I suppose I'll write the first review now that the product has actually been released.  I consider myself a child of the 80s, although this 1980 series pre-dates my ability to remember the original airing by at least a couple of years.  However, having watched the set I recognize several of the episodes from later syndication and remember enjoying these a lot.

We have here two dual-layer (no double-sided) DVDs.  The contents are divided into individual Richie Rich and Scooby Doo show segments, ranging from 7 to 12 minutes in length.  Extra short Richie Rich ""Gem"" segments are appended to the end of the previous cartoon and are not listed in the menu.  The cartoons from each hour episode are presented in sequential order in the menu.  There is the ever-present ""Play All"" option, but there doesn't appear to be a way to select and play full hour episodes.  The first cartoon from each episode has the original opening sequence, including mixed theme music and mixed animation of Richie and Scooby characters.  The last cartoon from each hour has two separate closing credits in sequence -- not sure if one or both are original.

The cartoons pertaining to each hour episode are listed on the inside cover of the DVD jacket.  The Richie cartoons do not appear to have title cards, just generic ""Riches"", ""Treasure Chest"" and ""Zillion-Dollar Adventures"" segment titles, so the actual cartoon titles are only visible in the menu and the jacket, and where they come from is anyone's guess (syndication titles maybe?).

I find the Richie Rich cartoons to be rather fun.  The character designs are improved slightly from the comic book and Richie seems a bit older.  I'm not otherwise familiar with the comic books or their stories, but the cartoon features adventures with Richie foiling crooks and solving problems, often with the help of his many wonderful gadgets and technology.  There is his robot maid Irona, who can seemingly turn into anything, and the endless assortment of gadgets and gizmos provided by Professor Keenbean.  The optimistic and unapologetic inclusion of so much gadgetry and fanciful technology is fun to watch.  The animation is as good or better than most any H-B series, although the backgrounds are a little flat and the cartoon often resembles a side-scrolling game.  However, Richie's world is bright and colorful and the action is fairly non-stop.  Gloria's voice has a few Bart Simpson moments, but otherwise usually sounds like a young girl.  I think kids today would still enjoy this cartoon immensely.

Then there are the Scooby Doo segments.  Yes they have Scrappy.  While far from my favorite character, in this early entry he's not THAT bad.  I think some kind of third wheel was necessary to pull off this less (to use the term loosely) cerebral incarnation of Scooby Doo.  Scrappy Doo is the catalyst that usually gets Shaggy and Scooby into trouble, followed by lots of fearful whimpering and running scared.  The episodes are a short 7 minutes.  Villains are often real monsters with real supernatural powers.  There are no explanations, no mystery solving, no unmasking some phony in a costume.  The stories are action packed and are meant to entertain with the non-stop comic antics of Shaggy and Scooby, running around scared out of their wits and trying to escape while keeping Scrappy from getting them into even more trouble.  The short running times keep them watchable.  They certainly seem targeted toward a younger audience than earlier Scooby Doo adventures, and would likely still be entertaining to younger children.

I'd say Warner Brothers did a better job on this release than some previous efforts.  If this is the quality we can expect with these slimmer 2-disc Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection sets then I'm reasonably satisfied.  Here's hoping more volumes come out with all the rest of Richie Rich and many other H-B properties still waiting in the wings.",1211587200,22,3925,4.987692307692308
3337771,4,B0013D8LPY,"Richie Rich was a great favorite of mine as a kid. And I still enjoy it when the Boomerang channel plays it (they once spent a 24 hour period playing RIchie Rich). Im not the only one, im actually suprised at the number of adults who count Boomerang as one of the only channels that make cable worth paying for. These H-B collections have been great and grant these shows a long life void of the deteriation that comes from VHS. There are so many things I am hoping for because I love so much of what H-B put out. Richie Rich is one im surprised took this long to come out. I personally do not recall the Scooby portion of this hour. Regardless I am buying this exclusively for the RIchie Rich cartoons. I would like information on the amount of time this box set has in it.

3337772,3,B0013D8LPY,"As a 1970s child (growing up on 1970s TV, of course) this is one of the *few* 1980s cartoons I have loads of fond memories of (minus the ""Scooby trio"" here, doing nothing but bungling and bumbling their way thru every ep. The original 1969 S-D had more class, more pizazz). Anyways, I grew up with BOTH the comic book as well as the cartoon, where I watched every ep. (religiously) and, let me say, it really knows how to stay true to the original (where you see Richie rescuing Gloria, or Reggie pulling one of his countless pranks, only to backfire on him, and so on). However, one main difference here also has the storylines of Jonny Quest with the quirky gadgets/inventions of the Jetsons mixed in (two earlier H-B creations).  Even Season 3, as I remember it, really had a LOT OF HEART.
One ep. shows Irona, the Riches' maid, wanting to try her hand at sports instead of just keeping house 24/7. Richie coaches her, only she ends up breaking one world record after another.  So, by the end, Irona does her ""weightlifting"" event, where she actually lifts heavy inanimate objects from the mansion (like a piano, a statue) with the Rich family and staff acting as judges, holding up score cards and applauding. Richie then hugs Irona and says ""These are the only critics you should listen to, Irona, people who love you the most!""  (Awww, how sweet and nothing sugary about it, either.)

Other eps. also have Richie and co. (namely Gloria and Dollar) trying to catch villains and crooks of every type out there, from ruthless bug-like space aliens, to eccentric oddballs, such as the Giggler and Mr. Dirty, and to the baddies straight out of the comic book pages, like the Onion, Dr. Disguise, and the Shocking Lady.  Richie manages to catch and nail every one them, with Dollar klutzing up in the end and providing comic relief as well.

I was eight when this came out in 1980, and it still holds true for me today: LOTS OF HEART, PLENTY OF ACTION AND FUN, AND JUST SO PHENOMENAL.
FORGET THE SCOOBY SEGMENTS: HERE, THE GANG HAS BEEN REDUCED DOWN TO A ""TRIO"" AND GOES SO FAR AS TO SHOW SOME EPS IN WONDERLAND OR THE LAND OZ.

Also, here's something else you all should know: this has its share of veteran cartoon voice actors (like Mr. Slate's John Stephenson in a few eps. from Seasons 2 & 3) as well as a few new up-and-comings just starting out in the business (Nancy Cartwright, who you all know does Bart Simpson, also does the voice of Gloria).",1207785600,6,2453,4.511261261261262

Is this series a 5-Star classic? Well, no it's not. But it hardly rates 1 star. Hanna-Barbera at their worst was leaps and bounds above Filmation, DIC and other animation chop shops at their best. If you're a fan of Scooby-Doo, or the Hanna-Barbera library of cartoons, you'll definitely enjoy this selection. I'm only disappointed that  Warner Bros. Home Video has opted to go the ""Volume 1"" route instead of the ""Complete Series."" I assume that's to keep costs down since this was an hour-long show.

My only concern is that Warner Bros. Home Video is notorious for releasing edited versions of the H-B library and calling them ""Complete."" I am hoping that's not the case here.",1205625600,8,758,4.770992366412214
