Even if the viewer is not a student of art nor a connoisseur they will find the people in this video have something important to give them.  In essence, we are all  artists when viewed through Laurie McDonald's camera.  Check it out. These  Houston, Texas folk artists inspired me, made me laugh and most of all made  me want to see their work. This is art that lives and is created every day.
