8060686,5,B0009HBPH6,"I have had this video for a few years and it is a great video to go back and forth with. It includes all the bascis needed to start toning in the areas ""women"" need most. I am not a fan of workout DVD's but this one gave me results pretty quick whereas others have left me just watching the TV because I was unable to do 1/2 the moves even after watching the DVD twice! This is an inexpensive way to lose a few inches for the summer and worth every penny.",1247184000,,455,3.903225806451613
