3850524,5,B00260ZIAY,"Robert Hughes is an incisive and entertaining art critic. This DVD set is an engaging video tour of the ""modern"" era and a wonderful follow up to his book with the same title.",1269993600,9,175,4.333333333333333
3850525,4,B00260ZIAY,"Robert Hughes is a well-respected and widely published art critic. In these videos he addresses modern art, starting with the eiffel tower as an emblem of the modern age, built late in the 19th century. Hughes has original ideas on modern art; he doesn't just repeat all the textbook cliches. I also like how the videos place the art into different historical contexts, bringing out how they are part of the larger cultural context. For anyone interested in modern art, these 4 dvds are very worthwhile. Each DVD addresses modern art within a different cultural context.",1251504000,14,570,4.947916666666667
3850526,5,B00260ZIAY,"I saw this documentary when it first came out and it totally changed my way of looking at art, architecture and eventually even music which it really didn't even address in the film. When you spend the time with the fabulous Robert Hughes who is so impassioned with what he is talking about and describes it in such easily understood terms, you come away with not just an apreciation but a way of seeing. Years later after seeing this documentary I was in Barcelona and stumbled into the Picasso museum with my five year old kid and it all came back to me everything that Hughes had said about Picasso and modern art in general. The two of us had a wonderful time exploring Picasso and a few years later we got to see a Goya exhibit and could make the transition of fascination and joy of art to older works as well. His explanation of the significance of the Eiffel Tower made our journey up to the top just that more thrilling. This documentary for me was a sprinboard to great things and a way of looking at life. All I can say is thank you Robert Hughes! I think if you are lucky enough to see this film you will say the same thing.",1250985600,43,1136,4.263888888888889
3850531,3,B00260ZIAY,"I have to agree, unfortunately, with Gary Douglas; the image quality of this set is unacceptable for a DVD, and for this excellent series in particular. It may have been transferred from a U-matic tape, at best, but there's no question it comes from an old tcopy of the films. I purchased this because of the convenience of having it on disc. If you're an instructor using this series for a course in art (as I am), check it out of the University library. If your institution has it and can play it on tape, you won't notice a difference.
On a side note there's a follow-up episode, a kind of delayed epilogue, shot by Hughes before he died recently. It isn't out on video yet but if someone has the sense to do a proper digital release of Shock of the New, using the original materials (16mm, I'm guessing), that extra episode would be a nice addition.",1389657600,3,853,4.405063291139241
3850532,5,B00260ZIAY,"I am the librarian of our Art Association and I ordered this and the accompanying book for the members to use and enjoy. I remember watching the series years ago on PBS and was so impressed with it. It has stuck with me all these years. They came quickly, and just as described. Excellent!",1369180800,,289,4.37037037037037
3850533,5,B00260ZIAY,"At least Robert Hughes is a man unafraid of giving his highly educated and erudite opinion, he is no poltroon.",1367884800,,110,4.55
3850534,5,B00260ZIAY,"It arrived on time, was exactly what I was looking for and have seen the entire series and it is great.",1361145600,,103,3.9523809523809526
3850535,5,B00260ZIAY,It covers modern art in such an erudite and entertaining way. Robert Hughes is at the top of his form. Highly recommended,1357603200,2,121,4.545454545454546
3850536,5,B00260ZIAY,"If you don't understand modern art; if you think a child could do it better; if you dismiss it as unworthy; here is a series of art lessons by a winningly provocative art critic---alas, no longer living---whose insights on modern art will leave you informed and admiring of it.",1356998400,,277,4.673469387755102
3850537,3,B00260ZIAY,"I had seen this series not long after Robert Hughes made it and was enthralled. When I heard of his death I knew I had to revisit this classic and refresh my art history via Hughes excellent delivery. The series is as I remembered in content, i.e. excellent, entertaining and illuminating. Unfortunately the picture qulity is atrocious. It's as though it was copied from an old VHF tape that had degenerated with age. Though I can make do for the sake of seeing it again both audibly and visually, it is unforgivable that a DVD series on art should be delivered with such poor colourisation. Robert Hughes and Shock of the new 5 stars - quality of these particular DVDs 1 star.",1352937600,22,677,4.557377049180328
3850538,4,B00260ZIAY,"I purchased the DVD Set of this great work.  I watched the PBS original broadcast, and still remember much content.  I'll recommend media updates to Ambrose Video & the BBC:

1.)  Add Closed Captions, please.
2.)  Labels of Art Piece & Artist Name would be useful.
3.)  Early 1980's Standard Video quality.  Robert Hughes work deserves more.

The August 2012 death of Robert Hughes motivated me to purchase.  Maybe Ambrose Video will be motivated to update?",1345420800,7,457,4.907894736842105
3850539,4,B00260ZIAY,"I knew about The shock of the new several years ago, when transferring old Betamax tapes recorded by a friend of my father from the original series airings in the early eighties.

I was impressed and captivated by Hughes since the very first minute. His way of integrating evolution of art in history, and the influence of technical, political and social events as well as individual influence of the major artists, draws a very clear and personnal view of the whole thing. He expresses his opinion loud and clear, and is not concerned about being politically correct, so you may agree or not with him, but you surely will be involved as if you were arguing with him.

Of course, quality of the now 30 years old Betamax tapes was very poor, so I decided to purchase this DVD set. Much to my disappointment, transfer quality of the DVD's from the original 16mm master films is very poor, lacking sharpness and with severe color shifting. Ironically, color in the old tapes I had was perfect. Another curious thing is that, in each chapter, about 3 minutes of footage have been cut, I suppose in order to kept the running time of each chapter under 60 minutes.

Anyway, this is the only commercially availaible copy of The shock of the new series, and though it is a pity that the image is not of top quality, the amazing commentaries by Hughes are worth the expense of purchasing it. I hope we would see it some day remastered in a proper Blu-ray high quality version.",1337904000,14,1467,4.570342205323194
3850540,5,B00260ZIAY,I was excited to see that this series is finally available on DVD. The publisher of this version is Ambrose Video. It is available at their web site for $60.00. They currently indicate USA shipping only.,1312761600,20,203,4.666666666666667
8351673,1,B00260ZIAY,"The content was as expected from Robert Hughes  -  informative, mind-changing, and riveting.  Or at least that was most likely the experience for people who had seen the original TV series.  I had to really focus to overcome the inadequacies of the DVD recording, to somehow see through to the fabulous content buried beneath.  Unfortunately the production qualities of the DVD set were less than optimal.  Both the visuals and sound were 'muddy'.  Both visuals and sound lacked clarity, they were dull, muted.  Possibly amateurish.  It had the feel of a backyard job.  Disappointing.",1516838400,,584,5.117021276595745

8351675,4,B00260ZIAY,Robert Hughes is quite simply my favourite art critic so for me he can do no wrong.  The quality of the DVDs on the other hand is not brilliant.  Could it be remastered or whatever it is called?,1457740800,,194,4.078947368421052
8351676,5,B00260ZIAY,"A wonderfully literate comprehensive history of modern art.  The series has a melancholy view of the great promise of the many art movements and their ultimate demise.  Highly recommended for any who visit a modern art exhibit and just ""don't get it"".  This is a serious work and wasted on the dull witted.",1455494400,,306,4.735849056603773
8351677,5,B00260ZIAY,"I beg the BBC to restore this masterpiece. This is one of the best documentaries on art ever made. Robert Hughes, the Australian art critic who became the art critic for Time magazine, wrote and narrated this exposition on the cultural forces behind 20th century art. It is dizzying. It is dense. It is very articulate and deeply profound. Other critics have compared Hughes' writing to George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare. You have to rewind repeatedly to listen for a second time. Unfortunately, the quality of the VHS transferred to digital is shockingly bad. An acute critical examination of 20th century art that is, 35 years later, visibly dull and faded; the audio quality is only a little better. But because the narration is staggeringly good, you ignore the poor video quality. The interviews of Marcel Duchamp and Albert Speer are alone worth the price of this expensive set but the lectures by Robert Hughes are priceless. This is a graduate school level survey of 20th century art that I recommend to every aspirant intellectual who is trying to synthesize a coherent view of the splintered and fragmented causations of modern culture.",1434326400,3,1156,4.994818652849741

8351680,4,B00260ZIAY,"in my opinion, the art world in the twenty first century has been reduced to being a Ponzi scheme with pictures. Shock of the New examines the art world prior  to that happening",1402790400,,177,4.363636363636363
8351681,4,B00260ZIAY,"Although guided by the brilliant Robert Hughes! I felt a litle lost amidst too much information.
The quality of the sound was, for me, as a non native english speaker, lacking clarity and Mr. Hughes' diction and fast pace, sometimes  a little hard to follow.
A pity he is no longer here to revisit the series adding his sharp criticism and comments to the subject!",1391904000,,364,4.6
8351682,5,B00260ZIAY,"I watched this series on PBS some 30 years ago, and couldn't wait for  it to be digitized
 on DVD. This is a dream come true. The late Robert Hughes is one of my favorite art
critics. The other series by him is American Visions, now available only in book and VHS.",1391040000,,264,4.0576923076923075
