I loved this show, although I have to admit that I didn't feel the same about it once Susan Walters left the cast.  The chemistry between Susan Walters and Tony Crane was steamy...and I only wish the writers and done more to tempt us with their relationship later on in the series.  The writing changed and some of the characters seemed to disappear about midway through the first season, but I still consider this one of my favorite series ever.  The New Orleans setting, the music, the quirky characters, the push-pull relationship of Remy and Anne - I loved every minute of it.

3145105,5,B0015I2RZM,Love New Orleans? Then you will love this series. Captures the spirit and values of the Crescent City and its residents. Excellent cast.,1354492800,,136,4.956521739130435
3145106,4,B0015I2RZM,"I used to watch this show when it came out on TV in the late 90s and I loved it. Well, I was also a kid back then and easily impressed I guess. I mean wow was I enamored by Tony Crane who captured Remy McSwain's arrogant and sexy swagger so deliciously.  I also loved the sexual tension between him and Ann Osbourne and the steamy, sexy New Orleans scene and shots of the French Quarter and surrounding neighborhoods. The movie just had a certain charm to it.

Anyway, now, looking at the show I must say it is pretty bad. I love the music, the setting and the sexy vibe of it all, but story and acting wise it leaves much to be desired. It is just not very sophisticated. Remy McSwain (Tony Crane) is your typical film-noir detective. His character is pretty one dimensional and he acts more like he was a private eye than a cop. He is a caricature of your typical loner detective who has a problem with authority really and who roams the steamy city with driving a metallic blue Corvette with the top down while wearing white linen suits with yellow silk shirts and a gold ring. He really doesnt have much of a personality beyond that. I seriously doubt any cop could walk around and behave like that - not even in NO; then again, this is one of the charming things about the show - although it would have been nice to have a multidimensional character.

Ann Osbourne (Susan Walters) who's supposed to be the assistant DA is not very believable in that role, mainly because she spends most of her time chasing people around while playing detective with Remy and throwing in the occasional legal jargon to create tension between her and Remy.

The series is filled with clichees like that. For example, the chief of police walks around with a cigar in his mouth all day making snide remarks (you wonder how he became chief, he never seems to do any work).  The cranky female assistant is a bit quirky and is always ready to deliver some smart remark to antagonize the lead and of course there is  the lead's side-kick and buddy who is willing to break the rules on his behalf because he aint a cop like Remy.

So yes the story lines are unbelievable and the characters full formula, but I go in there understanding and accepting this as a premise and enjoy it.

I also don't care it supposedly wasn't a 100% accurate depiction of New Orleans or if the Cajun accent wasn't copied meticulously. This isn't supposed to be a freaking documentary but a lightweight cop show placed in New Orleans. If you want something more authentic, with the same story lines evolving around either sexual abuse, rape or passionate murders because of sexual abuse and rape, go watch Law Order or CSI. This show is mid/late 90s, kitch; it is goofy and colorful with a great soundtrack. Has sort of an innocence and simplicity to it that you cannot find in any of the TV shows of today that mostly seem to be about some kind of government or alien conspiracy with a political undertone. This show is easy entertainment and  Tony Crane is just dope.",1325894400,,3027,4.459312839059675
3145107,4,B0015I2RZM,"I'm really enjoying this show.  Never had pay channels before so I never heard of it.  I've wanted to try it out but it was just too costly.  finally went on sale a bit and I'm thrilled I took the leap.  It's way better than it gets credit for - takes three episodes before you're hooked though - then you can't stop watching.  I wish there were more shows like this in the sense that it's different, unique geographically and in character.  Most crime dramas are all the same - even the great ones are all very similar.  Because of the location, the accents, the ""big Easy"" culture, it is very unique.  Every big city crime show tends to end up the same, it's rare to have a crime drama in such a unique location with actual southern accents.  Every show these days is in the same old big cities where everyone in the show is a city person, they all sound the same and look the same - even the shows I love don't have any character diversity, location diversity, etc.  I really love the show.",1244160000,6,993,4.262032085561497

8258665,4,B0015I2RZM,"After watching this show on the air twenty years ago, I barely recalled the storylines, but remembered that I enjoyed it, so ordered it to take another look.  I have enjoyed it so much.  With the dearth of real acting on television in these days of reality tv (which wedding dress will she choose, which wife will have a bad hair day, or who will survive/dance/sing through the week ---sick to death of all of it) it was captivating to watch a series with great actors, great music, and beautiful locales.  This is what tv used to be.  It is fun, a little corny, the storylines are a little weak, hence the rating of 4.  But in all other areas, I consider it a good show.  Living near New Orleans, I believe that they caught the spirit and heart of the city very well.  A real effort was made to capture the culture and attitudes, the beautiful sights and famous locales in this most European of American cities.  And if the characters are a little stereotyped, it is still nice to see Ann order an Abita beer.",1510617600,,1010,4.363636363636363

This show has intriguing stories, colorful characters, and I loved the seeing the other side of New Orleans, the side that shows the idea of real people that live in such an amazing city. The music is just, WOW. They need to make a music CD from this show. I should buy a back up of this DVD  because I know I'll wear mine out.
