2429682,4,B000BNI9EU,"Three episodes that explore the life, or what life might have been like, before the dinosaurs showed up onto the stage.  With only about 90 minutes that does seem to leave a lot of details out but most of the major turning points are hit on - animals and plants moving from the oceans to the land, the development of certain organs for survival, evolution working to make animals and plants more fit.  Sea scorpions, giant spiders and killer fish that could take on sharks make me happy I live NOW and not back then.

The DVD extra, the Trilogy of Life, talks about the history of the THREE shows, Walking with Dinosaurs, Walking with Beasts and Walking with Monsters to show how the first series produced the next and so on.

I really enjoyed this series and wanted more - I think dinosaurs get too much of the spotlight and would like to know more about life before and after them.",1140048000,25,883,4.432098765432099
2429683,5,B000BNI9EU,"Nobody should confuse this with a course of paleontology. Nobody should even confuse this with a broad survey of the subject. Instead, it is a magnificent flight of imagination based upon some real science but which does not let the science take precedence over the wonder. It is wonderful

This is a series of three programs. Each deals with prehistoric life before the advent of the dinosaurs.

In the first program, we are treated to one theory of the formation of our planet and introduced to the Cambrian seas. There are not dinosaurs here. Fish barely even exist. That does not stop the cycle of predation in a world of gigantic marine scorpions and the proto-fish prey. We see the colonization of the land by the first plants and encounter the first amphibians, learning a little bit about the evolutionary pressures that drove their emergence. The program ends with the first true reptiles and the hard shelled egg.

The second episode takes place more on land. Gigantic arthropods contest with gigantic amphibians and the odd reptile here and there. We see the first strains of reptile that will eventually give rise to the mammals. Life is still a contest of the predator and the prey.

The third episode advances the story through the lives of some early, pre-dinosaur reptiles. The motif of eat and be eaten is still the rule of the day. The episode ends with the apprearance of true dinosaurs, where the series first began.

There is a lot of speculation in this work. Some of it is well reasoned and logical. Some of it is much less so. Only a few species are looked at with any degree of detail. The great Devonian age of the fishes is bypassed in a short sentence. That does not stop the wonder of it all. It is fascinating seeing the fossils come to life even with the speculations.

The DVD also includes a ""making of"" segment which covers all three of the series. It too is worth watching.

This will never replace real coursework and has all of the depth of the old, ""Mutual of Omaha Wild Kingdom"" but neither was ever intended to teach zoology. Both were meant to kindle a sense of wonder. Both accomplish that end.",1139702400,79,2136,4.620052770448549

The best thing about the series is that it gives one really powerful visual idea of what these creatures may have looked like alive.

2429740,2,B000BNI9EU,"While I enjoy looking at the reconstructions of the animals interacting in environments, I really wish this documentary had spent more time talking about actual science than creating these dramas between animals which are pure speculation. I've heard somewhere that behavior doesn't fossilize, so I don't know where the documentary-makers get the idea that Dimetrodons would fight for a whole day, non-stop, to protect its eggs. The documentary spends more time talking about the unproven / unverified behavior of these animals than  actual scientific facts like the creation of Pangea causing dry weather and destroying the forests of the carboniferous, which in turn favored the rise of amniotes over amphibians during the Permian.
There's only three episodes that cover 7 geological periods (about 300 millions years). The first episode crams in 5 geologic periods, which leaves a lot out, like the massive extinctions at the end of the Ordovician, and Devonian. They also don't show certain ""famous"" animals like Dunkleostus or Cameroceras. The second episode focuses on the Permian. The third episode is about the end of the Permian and the early Triassic. Interestingly, the documentary doesn't give any explanation for the Permian extinction. I know the debate about its cause hasn't been put to rest, but it would have been nice to see some explanation besides ""it got really hot"".
Lastly, and this is a minor peeve of mine, I feel like the animals in these ""Walking with..."" series make too much noise. In my experience, animals tend to be pretty quiet. They don't spend every minute making random vocalizations.",1400371200,,1621,5.210727969348659

It's a shame that someone chose to try and cheat someone out of their money with this broken DVD rather than just throw it away. That being said, the amount of the documentary I was able to watch was certainly amazing. I loved BBC documentaries when I was little. I had only seen this once when I was little, on TV, and since then I have wanted to track down a copy and buy it. It was certainly informative, well-narrated and superbly animated, just like all of their other documentaries. my only wish was that they spent more time on each time period the covered. I feel like they only skimmed over each era and didn't take enough time to really go into depth about each time period. Bottom line: I liked the DVD and recommend it, but would have loved it if it was a fully functioning copy, and therefore I also recommend caution when looking for a copy to purchase.",1394928000,,1047,4.292929292929293
2429742,5,B000BNI9EU,"This is a three-episode video, 90 minutes long, that covers many fascinating creatures that preceded the dinosaurs.
Starting with the arthopods like the giant sea scorpion, then the first vertebrate fish, the first amphibian, the first land-dwelling reptile and leading right into the dinosaurs with some great pit stops into giant spiders, giant centipedes and the fearsome dimetradon.

The series is terrific and detailed, given its compact run time, in showing the evolution of limbs, lungs, and other modern anatomical adaptations that have taken hundreds of millions of years to evolve.

Just a great series, and though it contains a making of series special feature, I wish it were longer. Still, I highly recommended.

2429767,5,B000BNI9EU,"Dinosaurs are the world's favorite fossils. Without question. From Barney to Jurassic Park to major natural history museums, Dinosaurdepictions are everywhere. But Dinosaurs lived only during the Mesozoic Era (about 170 million years long) and that is but a short segment in the total 4.l billion-year history of life as is represented by the fossil record. Well, it seems, justly or unjustly, that Dinosaurs get all the press. I teach a course in fossils and the history of life (a junior-level course) at San Diego State University and, believe me, there's an abundance of exceptionally interesting fossils in the record other than Dinosaurs. The ""Walking With Monsters: Before the Dinosaurs)"" DVD  attempts to portray that record from the first appearance of substantial-sized fossils (Cambrian time) well up into the time of the Dinosaurs. In my opinion, it partially succeeds and partially falls short. Don;t get me wrong. I like the DVD and regard it as a wonderful first step.

Fossils consist of preserved teeth and bones and a variety of traces such as footprints. They must be painstakingly extracted from the rock record, studied with great care, curated and exhibited in one way or another. From that as a beginning, an incredible amount of overlapping interpretations are added and some of these are nothing but pure speculation. For example, fossils don't make noises so when you view this interesting DVD, all the growling, hissing, roaring or whatever sounds you might hear are nothing but pure imagination. Most of the appearances of these life forms is in the interpretation of the artists and how realistic they might be is open to question. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against all of this interpretation. It's part of the fun of paleontology. But when I view reconstructions such as in this DVD (or in Dinosaur DVDs for that matter), I have my own ways of interpreting things and I can get highly critical. But alas, the DVD is meant for the entertainment and education of the general public, and I'm inclined to think it does this rather well,

One of the  things that always gripes me is that about 80% of Dinosaurs are herbiverous (live on plants as food), but about 80% of Dinosaur depictions are devoted to carniverous varieties. It seems that an abnormal interest in blood and gore and violence prevails. Why is this? Well, in this ""Walking With Monsters"" DVD, it's the same way. I guess people just want to see blood and gore and movie directors enjoy giving it to them. Action! I mean, who wants to watch a herd of something or other peacefully grazing? But, I'd be saying that you'd be watching a very distorted picture of the history of life in viewing these DVDs, wonderful though they might be. In any case, that's just one of my personal quirks.

The DVD is broken into three parts with the first part ranging from about Cambrian time well up into Silurian time. Most of the historical depictions in this segment are of marine forms of life and that conforms precisely with the fossil record. The second part of the DVD depicts life from about The Devonian Period up through the Carboniferous Period and into the Permian Period. This is a time when life gradually emerges from an aquatic environment and becomes ever more adapted to the land. The third segment is from the Permian Period well up into the time of the Dinosaurs and almost all of the depicted life is terrestrial. The organization is appropriate and well done. I could quibble about the marine reptiles, but I won't. Now, the history of life is very complex and cannot be captured in a one-hour DVD. I would say that each of these three episodes should be expanded into a full DVD in themselves, The ""Walking With Monsters"" DVD is a good start, but it attempts to cover too much territory. In any case, I enjoyed the DVD and don't have any hesitation to awarding it five stars.

2429768,5,B000BNI9EU,"This whole series is a wonder to watch, Most of us growing up could have never imagined such a realistic show featuring long extinct animals. Even forty years ago they didn't understand about the real nature of dinosaurs or even mammal like reptiles. And special effects were models not computer animation. The only fault with this show is that they do speculate alot. For instance Dimetrodons eating their young. Perhaps they did, or perhaps they didn't, they are the ancestors of mammals so who knows?. Perhaps they raised them. but in their defense they use what modern reptiles would do and interpolate it onto this show. I have the whole series on dvd and when I saw them on tv I was amazed. At the time it was very cutting age. Now we see more of this but at least this is based alot in science. This is an outstanding show and was a step forward in shows like this. The whole series was. Now on natgeo you may see similiar shows but these shows were breakthroughs and can give people a greater insight into the pastworlds of the creatures before the dinosaurs. Which are very interesting. I do wonder though if protomammals didn't have hair on them. It may be that they did in fact look as hairy as todays mammals.
Not in this show though. kids over 7 should enjoy this show immensely. And adults like me can't get enough. I still look for shows on the science channel, nat geo or discovery featuring dinosaurs. Or even the bbc when they do a occasional show.",1325030400,,1466,4.49438202247191

The graphics were well done and the animals looked realistic.
Key anatomical distinctions and developments are highlighted with each new animal.
Negatives:
The size of some of the animals (i.e., giant sea scorpions, dragon flies, and spiders) don't seem large on screen.  Others looked more their correct size, but these did not.
The show is rushed and would have been better with each animal getting more time.
There seems to be more supposition and speculation put forward in this show than in the others of the series.
It was kind of preachy in that just about every 10 minutes a new critter is described as our ancestor.  It would be nice if they'd make a good show about these animals without hammering the point that either: A) we evolved from such-and-such animals or B) that evolution is a scientifically baseless fraud.

2429784,5,B000BNI9EU,"I just enjoyed watching the abridged movie length version yesterday.  I enjoyed this much more than the other chapters of the story (Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Beasts).  Walking with Monsters appears to me to have a number of advantages.

Firstly, the animation appears to me to be more believable, at least in parts.  The animals appear more at home in their environment, and less clunky.  Though I can appreciate that this view would differ from person to person: at the time this thought occurred to me, someone spoke out to say that it looked fake!

Secondly, the narration by Kenneth Brannagh is much easier to listen to.  It is less overbearing, and less obtrusive.  The images and the story carry more weight than his voice acting in this ""speculation"".

Thirdly, the story gives more emphasis on the theories especially relating to evolution, and less on the dramatisation of the lives of animals.  It was particularly effective to see the changing shape of the animals postulated through evolution, and to have the periods/eras of time clearly highlighted.  We have a poster of these time periods and our eight year old enjoyed referring to these while we watched the DVD.  He especially delighted in hearing about our ancestry being traced back to the fish!

Overall the series is a great achievement, and I'm sure has made some advancements towards society's understanding of the concepts that we can gather from our prehistory.  Its certainly improved my knowledge.",1232582400,4,1490,5.004065040650406

This section of the series should have focused more into the Devonian Period (Age of Fish)and included more footage into this period of Earth's history. There were some impressive fish during this period. The series does focus on the huge fish called Hyneria, but the footage on this fish does not appear to contain the large teeth found in fossil finds. This video series is a close second to Walking with Dinosaurs. However, I have read that the series appears to have made an error on the cat sized spider, which was identified recently as a eurypterid instead of a spider. The series does concentrate heavily on the spider, and should have put more time into Devonian fish species, since recent fossil finds have identified magnificent types.

2429811,5,B000BNI9EU,"I found this ""walking with"" to be very good, even in comparison to Dinosaurs and Beasts. I liked how they made it different from the others; such as showing the evolution from one era to the next and the insides of some of the animals.
They also didn't make it as long as the others, but it was actually better having shorter. I found it easier to watch.
There was one thing i didn't like about it and that was some of the effects. Although the cgi upclose seemed to work, the animatronics weren't as impressive as the previous films. The parts that get me (and if you haven't seen it yet you may want to skip this!) are the ones such as where the giant spider attacked the petrolacosaurus and it was half cgi and half puppet. Why wouldn't they have just done it all cg? another one was where the chasmatosaurs attacked the lystrosaurs in the river. At one point the animatronic chasmatosaur bites the lystrosaurus and there is a spray of blood, which is clearly being done by someone off camera. However the lystrosaur animatronics are quite well done, especially considering its operating in the water. I forgot to mention, the chasmatosaur puppets have no intricate movements at all. There jaws are always open, there eyes never shut, there tounges nor nostrils don't move at all. At one point they're on the beach apparently sunbathing, and they don't move at all. They even used the same head in the water as they did on land! Other than those slight mishaps, the special effetcs were top notch.
All the episodes are wonderful, and they all have intresting animals, spectacular effects, great storylines and up-to-date facts squeezed in. However the last episode was kind of short and not as good as the others. It kind of lacked content, but it works. the bonus features on this disc are also quite enjoyable.
 I'm glad i bought this DVD, and if you liked Walking with dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts, you'll love this adventure through the beginnings of our world.",1218153600,,1972,4.666666666666667

The show features creatures as diverse as sea scorpions, giant millipedes, orthocones, unusual-looking sharks, predatory lobe-finned fish, huge dragonflies, primitive crocodiles, and the famous sailback reptiles Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus.  This diversity of wildlife is greater than the other Walking with Dinosaurs serials.  The show is filmed like a nature documentary with minimal human presence, unlike some other dinosaur specials.  Of course, the show's creators have taken creative license with the vocalizations, skin tones, and behaviors of the featured animals, but this is necessary to make the show enjoyable.

Even years ago, alot of creatures presented here were just 'in theory', which has been long since debunked.
The set covers the eras of the Cambrian (and starting with the Cambrian explosion) and continues through the Late Permian. Alot of people (at least outside the field of paleantology) don't realize that a huge chunk of life was exterminated from Earth a good 250 million years ago.
Many different branches of the tree of life just poof. Gone.
As for the artistic merit, this film far exceeds expectations. The soundtrack is also excellent as well.

Don't take this film as a pure science documentary. Some of the animals in are mis-named as well, so there is some artisitic creativity. However, this is the closest thing I have ever seen that actually approaches the subject of early life on Earth.",1216684800,,1185,4.563380281690141

The motions and coloration and interactions among animals are very realistic, the narration is a good balance between technical information of interest to hobbyists and scientists and easy understanding for someone who knows little about the history of life on Earth.

An extremely successful documentary. Like Walking with Dinosaurs and the rest of the series. It might be a bit too much information for little kids. This hasn't stopped my little granddaughter from sitting on my lap watching it and pointing and shouting ""Fish"" at the screen and then ""Dinosaur"" if anything with legs and teeth shows up.

2429829,2,B000BNI9EU,"This could have been a truly wonderful experience, but it falls quite short of the rest of the series.  The animations are still good, and it's wonderful to see all of these reconstructions (even when artistic licenses are invoked), but there are many parts that may mislead the casual viewer.

The video starts will the collision of a large bolide that led to the formation of the moon, and then we jump to the Cambrian and <Anomalocaris>.  If you are interested in geobiology, early plants or other invertebrates of the early oceans, don't even pick this video up; they are mentioned in passing if at all.  Okay, so I guess we are talking about `monsters' and <Anomalocaris>, not microbes, the first plants or other inverts, was the monster of the time, but the video moves on to <Cephalaspis>, hardly a monster.  Granted, eurypterids are covered, but the chronology of their evolution becomes quite confusing.  Now, I am expecting some of the true monsters of the late Paleozoic; <Dunkleosteus>, xenacanthid sharks, <Onychodus>, etc.  Instead we leap ahead to <Hynerpeton> and the land invasion of the amphibians (<Stethacanthus> is shown, but never mentioned by name).  Suddenly, we are in a <Dimetrodon> landscape (how about that amniote egg?--why not convey its importance?).  Here is where a lot of speculation stretches the limits of reason.  Apparently, though there is no evidence of it, baby pelycosaurs would cover themselves in dung to escape the cannibalistic adults.  Funny, but I never came across anything like that in any of my paleoecology work...  Later, the video implies that the <Dimetrodon> eggs hatch in mere hours!  Of course, there is a segue at the end leading us toward the dinosaurs, but there is no mention of the Permian extinction, or any extinction for that matter, and its causes!

I was reluctant to give this video three stars; the reconstructions are cool enough to warrant 2.5.  Since I couldn't record such a score, I was forced, based primarily on the glaring omissions, extreme exaggerations and lack of continuity, to drop it down to two stars.  If you own the other ""Walking with..."" videos, you will obviously want this video.  If you are a paleontology minded person, you will enjoy seeing these fossils come to life.  If you are a casual science fan, keep in mind that you are seeing only a very small and very random part of the picture.  Less time should have been spent with creating a ""Crocodile Hunter""-like program, and more time should have been spent showing how these monsters came about and why they are no longer around.",1182902400,17,2578,4.912240184757506
2429830,5,B000BNI9EU,"If you enjoyed ""Walking With Dinosaurs"" and ""Walking With Prehistoric Beasts"", then you'll enjoy ""Walking With Monsters"". This journey takes you back to before the dinosaurs, to the start of life on Earth. You'll see the Earth's first super-predator get eaten by the Earth's first fish, 3-foot long scorpions devour ancient fish, two-ton fish eat sharks and 4-foot long salamanders, giant spiders, dragonflys, and millipedes fill a world ruled by swamps, giant reptiles with sails on their back get hunted by predators that look just like them, giant wolf-like reptiles and small prairie dog-like reptiles survive a harsh desert, and, finally, reptiles that migrate like wildebeests survive poisonous predators and ancient crocodiles. ""Walking With Monsters"" delights the young and the old and completes the BBC's story of life before humans. Enjoy!

2429836,1,B000BNI9EU,"Although the digital imagery and production values are similar to the rest of the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" trilogy, this one contains a LOT of gore and violence.  One thing I really appreciated about the other parts of the trilogy was that the violence was minimized by the lack of focus on killing.  Most scenes show minimal blood, and prey animals are dispatched quickly and easily -- unrealistically so, but it makes the show suitable for children of all ages.

In contrast, ""Before the Dinosaurs"" shows a lot of blood, and prey animals are killed realistically, meaning that there's not only blood, but the animals struggle and clearly are suffering and afraid.  This kind of footage isn't appropriate for children, IMO it's unsuitable for children any under 13.  And frankly, there were a number of scenes that upset me!

Also, 1 1/2 of the 3 episodes focus on HUGE insects.  While it was very interesting, and presumably scientifically accurate, it's also fertile nightmare fodder for younger children, another reason that I wouldn't recommend this one for children under 13.",1161475200,11,1081,5.03932584269663
2429847,3,B000BNI9EU,"Before the Dinosaurs - Walking with Monsters is the third installment from the ""walking with - trilogy of life"" series. Finishing in the beginning, this is the story of life at the beginning up to when the dinosaurs reign started to take off. This is a very good documentary, although it is not as ""near-flawless"" as the other two. (""Walking with Dinosaurs"" and ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"")

One of the major complaints is that it is way too short! Being only half as long as its predecessors caused it to be much too rushed. As soon as you've gotten familiar with the location you're in, it's off to the next one. As time was reduced, many plot elements would have to be left out, and of course predation wasn't one of them. There's just a little too much here, and it would have been nice if less of the focus was on this subject. (some of it is quite unrealistic and overly graphic)

Also added elements not shown at all in the first two were evolution cut-scenes, and the inside of animal anatomy. Seeing as how this is part of the trilogy, they could have kept the overall structure the same, but unfortunately that's not the case.

These complaints aside though, overall it is still a very enjoyable series. And it is still similar enough to feel very much a part of its predecessors. As usual the locations are perfect prehistoric habitats (although some are partially recreated with CGI) and the CGI models are superb and look outstandingly real. There are hardly any animatronics in this program, but that is due to the fact that the close-ups now look much more convincing in CGI than they did a few years ago.

""Trilogy of Life"" is a very interesting 30 min. extra, covering the creation of all three programs. (including footage of tests for ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" before the series was even in production)

So although not quite perfect, still a satisfying completion to the ""walking with - trilogy of life"", highly recommended!",1158278400,3,1949,4.687134502923977

2429875,3,B000BNI9EU,"Seems that Tim Haines and BBC decided to follow in George Lucas' footsteps. Making what would be best accepted by the public first, then completing the series later with the more controversial stuff (if Lucas had made the Phantom Menace first, no one would know what Star Wars is today - the story is far too complicated).

  Walking With Dinosaus and Prehistoric Beasts were both quite good, except the narration by Kenneth Branaugh, who seemed like he could care aless about what he was talking about and give the impression that these animals were failures (which they were not!) There are some things about the series that I didn't like, mostly the animatronics and some facts, nitpicking stuff.

  Walking With Monsters, in my humble oppinion is the least strong of the series for the following reasons. 1: It was too short. 2: The animals didn't act as naturalistically as they did in the others (spiders don't stab and stab their prey like a human murderer, they jab and then wait for their poison to take affect). 3: It seemed rushed - sequences that should have taken 30 minutes took half that.

  Despite these fallbacks, the CG is quite good, animatronics was used VERY sparingly and the Dimetrodon sequence is GREAT! It was my favorite of all of them. I would recommend this DVD just to complete the Walking With story. If you want more on PreDinosaurs, go for The Shape of Life DVD set. It's GREAT. So, on it's own, Walking With Monsters is a waste of time (in my oppinion), but with Walking With Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Beasts, it works fairly well. And despite all the series' fallbacks, everyone should have the complete series in their collection.

2429878,4,B000BNI9EU,"This ambitious video takes you walking far, far back in time, nearly to the beginning of life...or at least, life that was visible to you and me. It starts with the Cambrian era of ocean life, with a weird-looking arthropod that may have been the very first predator. From then on, it is a running competition between arthropods and chordates, predator and prey. Highlights are the first land creatures, the amphibians, and the lush Carboniferous era of swamps and giant dragonflies. Then on to the time of Dimetrodon, which we know as ""the sailback lizard"", and to a weird assemblage of mammal-like reptiles called Synapsids which survived into the dry, hellish Permian era. All of these creatures are depicted with stunning realism through computer animation. The scenes are as vivid as any documentary about Africa... you really feel as if you are there!

I highly recommend this video, which does everything that Jurassic Park did, without the cornball story line. However, I have a few points of criticism which knocked my rating back to a ""4"". The authors of the series have set up little scripts, mostly about creatures fighting and eating each other. This gets a bit tiresome after several million years. I'm sure there was a lot of predation in the Paleozoic era, but I'd like to have seen more variety in the script. Perhaps some speculation about other animal behaviors, such as mating or reproduction, or adaptations to the environment. And why are Arthropods always set up as the ""bad guys""? Just once I'd like to see insects get the respect they deserve!

My other quarrel is about the depiction of the Permian Era. The narration tells us that it was a ""dry time"" and a time of climatic upheaval, when creatures were ""stressed"" and many died. This is a gross understatement. Something happened at this time which caused the greatest mass extinction in all of Earth's history. It is estimated that 90 percent of all species were snuffed out. Scientists are now speculating that a comet or asteroid may have struck the Earth, rupturing its crust and leading to massive volcanism. Continent-sized volcanoes poisoned Earth's atmosphere, killed most of the ocean life, caused a runaway greenhouse effect, and raised the planet's temperature higher than at any other time.... perhaps 16 degrees C.

Why downplay an event this dramatic? It would have made a hell of a movie all its own! The fact that life recovered from this trauma is truly miraculous. Walking With Monsters does show that life recovered, and 10 million years later, weird-looking critters were still struggling to avoid being eaten by other weird-looking critters. And in the final note, new kinds of reptiles appear... the first dinosaurs.

2429879,5,B000BNI9EU,"This documentary is a view of life on earth before the dinosaurs. The film begins with the creation of the Moon by the impact of the hypothetical planet Theia with the Earth. Starting with the Cambrian period 530 million years ago, the evolution of life on earth is documented, starting with the earliest of man's ancestors, the Haikouicthys, an orange ""fish"" the size of a thumbnail. The progress of the sea-dwelling creatures is charted as they evolve into being able to exist on land and ends where the documentary ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" picks up, at the end of the Triassic period, with the first dinosaurs walking the earth and forcing the smaller mammalian creatures into a nocturnal existence of hiding.
DVD extras include a thirty-minute documentary entitled Trilogy of Life. This documentary covers all of the Walking with series (Dinosaurs, Beasts, and Monsters). There are numerous interviews with the filmmakers and producers of the series. There is even footage of the real locations and backgrounds before the animated beasts were inserted by computer. It's funny to see the filmmakers kicking up dust and moving trees with wires ""pretending"" to be the dinosaurs since the dinosaurs would be inserted later.
The documentary itself is presented with a great deal of detail and authority, as if the filmmakers know for a fact that this is exactly what took place, when in fact it is all quite hypothetical. However, you have to watch it understanding that its purpose is not to present an academic thesis. Instead, its purpose is to bring prehistory to life, just as if you were watching present-day animals being filmed, complete with animated prehistoric beasts occasionally bumping into an imaginary camera.
