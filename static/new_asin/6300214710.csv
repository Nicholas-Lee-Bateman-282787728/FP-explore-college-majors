275784,5,6300214710,"This movie still brings tears to my hi top wearing eyes. If ever there was a piece of cinema that truly reflected the 80's ... this is it. The only catch, which most people don't realise is that in the origional form, Andie  and Duckie end up together! ( If you can find the paperback book.. grab  it... ) however while filming things changed. It was never confirmed to me  that it was Ringwald that demanded the change ... but this just made it all  that much more realistic. The ending - the first tiem I saw it left me SO  ANGRY. Anyone who has been Duckie knows that you don't walk away as quickly  as that. I t had to be a mistake. Either way, an excellent portrait of the  80's , and a movie where Andrew "" Dice "" Clay does not utter a  single vulgar word. Who says miracles never happen.",949622400,3,794,4.1103896103896105
275785,5,6300214710,Pretty in Pink is one of the best movies Molly Ringwald had played in and that John Hughes directed.  If you love 80's movies I would pick this one.  It's a great teen flick about a poor girl falling in love with a rich guy.,933379200,,224,3.9555555555555557
275786,5,6300214710,This movie was the best! It really showed what it was like in the 80's. Molly Ringwald was wonderful a great date movie! I can't believe i finally found it at amazon.com!,929232000,,170,4.34375
275787,5,6300214710,"This movie set in the mid 80s era of brat-prack movies is a unique shining star. Molly Ringwald is Andie a girl from the wrong sides of the tracks who has romantic intrests from both sides of the spectrum; Duckie (Jon Cryer)  who's puppy-dog love for her is both sweet and endearing to watch, and  Blane (Andrew McCarthy) the rich guy who has everything going for him. What  follows is Andie having to deal with this, the bitchy cheerleader type  girls at school, her loving but dishonest father (Harry Dean Stanton) and  through all this will she get an invatation to the prom? This is a great  film, with both Blane, and Andie having to deal with their friends  disagreeeing with their relationship. Steff (James Spader at one of his  very best) Blane's best friend, who tries to make Blane try to decide  between Andie and himself, when really he just wants his finger in the pie.  Annie Potts as Iona, Andie's quirky older best friend is excellent and her  weird and orginal costume changes throughout the movie are a highpoint.  This is a emotionally raw film a rareity at the time it was made. If you  ask me this should have swept the Oscar nominations with Molly Ringwald  getting Best Actress, but hey regardless of the miss of Oscars watch this,  it is a powerful film and a great piece of film making",912038400,,1311,4.542735042735043
275788,5,6300214710,"In the 1980's U.S., of course teen flicks were the rage, and who other than John Hughes would bring it to us?  While Reaganism saturated politics and conservative notions of a ""classless"" society were rapidly being thrown about, Pretty in Pink arrived.  Although all of Hughes' teen-angst films of the 80's dealt with class issues in the predominantly white high schools of the U.S., Pretty in Pink demonstrates the most critical viewpoint of class, consumerism, capitalism, and how they all affect the high school hierarchy of popularity in suburban and more small town schools in the U.S. in comparison to its contemporaries like Some Kind of Wonderful, The Breakfast Club, or 16 Candles. Pink's main character, Andi, is a young woman from a lower-working class, single parent household.  She is academically robust, semi-financially independent, creative and thrifty, and assertive. She doesn't try to ""play the game"" of the ""richies,"" as she calls them, and rather, she stands up for herself and her friends in the face of ""benevolent"" middle to upperclass school administrators (read: the principal), smitten and haughty female classmates (read: benny and her friends), and exploitive and egotistical male classmates (read: Stef).  Her relationship with Blane is something which she takes with a grain of salt, and while she feels great affection for Blane, she is frank about her personal boundaries of acceptable behavior and treatment.  Thus, from a feminist perspective, Andi is a welcome young female character in the 80's Hollywood theatre which usually provides female characters so constructed by dominant ideologies that they no longer differ from each other, and become a token image (for example, the main character in Girls Just Wanna Have Fun or Cindy's friends in the film Can't Buy Me Love).  While the film is not immune from this tokenism, it offers definite progress in comparison to the aforementioned examples.  The film also takes a different approach to the then increasing ""phenomenon"" of the single-parent household (which was/is usually headed by the mother), in the fact that Andi's father runs the household.  While he struggles with his wife's abandonment, this seems to heavily influence his ambition to ""find a job.""  While this issue is not awarded much complexity in the film, it is at least mentioned, and hopefully encourages viewers to critically discuss this situation outside of the film.  For a mainstream film, Pretty in Pink offers many alternatives to the popular films so-far of 1998. Rather uninterrogated images of class differences and class oppression like those seen in Titanic or in Clueless provide a surface critique of class hierarchy and how it permeates youth cultures and high school ""societies.""  I recommend Pretty in Pink with the utmost sincerity.  While it proves problematic in certain areas, no film exists outside of power structures, culture, or oppression and it is our task as viewers to critically immerse ourselves in discussions of film and cinema.

SPOILERS
SPOILERS

I liked this film. I liked all the related John Hughes films that came out about this time with various collections of a larger group of actors called, at the time, the ""Brat Pack."" The story is a Cinderella/Romeo-n-Juliet-type theme set in the mid-80's where an unlikely romance is set up, then falters, then regains its strength at the end. Well, Romeo and Juliet died (Ooops! Sorry for the spoiler on that one!) and these characters didn't need to do that in order to be together, so I suppose this was a better ending.

However, it's not as good as the ending that was originally intended. I'm with the crowd of critics who would have preferred the original ending, where Duckie and Andie hook up at the end, rather than Andie and Blaine. The alleged story behind the change of endings is that Molly Ringwald didn't like the original, realistic ending, insisting that teenage girls would prefer that Andie win her rich guy at last. If that's the case, she misread the demographic rather badly, and I'm annoyed that John Hughes would ignore his better sense and give in to a teenage girl's complaints.

Andie's wardrobe I thought was a lot of fun. I'm curious about who really came up with her costumes; did Molly have any input? Another reviewer has criticized her wardrobe as looking like ""old women's clothing,"" and I think that's an understandable point of view to a modern-day viewer; she wore a lot of busy florals and frills and lace with granny boots. At the time, I saw it as being an off-shoot of the Madonna/Cyndi Lauper style: quirky and artistic compared to the standard ""preppie"" designer look that was the mainstream style then. OTOH, the prom dress Andie created at the end was an absolute nightmare; I don't know who came up with it, but compared to everything else Andie wore that she was supposed to have created, that horrible dress was completely ""out of character."" It was appalling and hideous. Whoever actually created it should have been shot. Or at least fired.

Oddly, at the end, I found myself wanting a sequel; not one where Andie marries either Ducky or Blaine and lives happily-ever-after, but one where she goes to art/fashion-design school and becomes a talented and successful designer in New York or Paris or Milan. Or all 3. She would still have some significant hurdles to overcome -- students who don't have access to lots of money while attending a college or university of any kind generally do. I wanted to see someone else in my predicament (as it was then) struggle and sacrifice and work hard in order to realize their dreams.

This was one of the movies where I first started to dislike the practice of using actors in their 20's to play characters in high school. James Spader is ultra-hot and sexy in this film and plays the snobbish, world-weary cynic, ""Steff,"" fabulously, but at NO POINT in the film does he EVER portray a believable 17-/18-yr-old boy. He looks and acts his real age: about 25. I'm never convinced at all that he's a realistic high school kid. Andrew McCarthy is worse. His face is actually showing signs of aging here, even as young as he was then, about 23. Jon Cryer at 21 was a little more believable as an 18-yr-old, and of course, Molly was a genuine 18-yr-old -- and LOOKED it. I understand that at least partly, the idea is to cast actors who look youthful but who are over 18 in order to avoid all the mandatory breaks and school time that are required for minor-age actors by law. OTOH, looking youthful doesn't necessarily mean looking young enough, and John Hughes had already worked around Molly Ringwald's and Anthony Michael Hall's ages in Sixteen Candles AND Breakfast Club without either film suffering for it, so why he would suddenly choose to cast a person who was a full 6 or 8 years older than his character is puzzling. (Judd Nelson also doesn't look 16/17 in Breakfast Club either, but that's another review.)

Still, in spite of these missteps, the film is sweet and romantic for the mid-teen set.",1499990400,,4021,4.688385269121813

276316,5,6300214710,"Although well intentioned, Pretty in Pink's repeated message of being true to oneself is completely lost during its lame conclusion. (A much different ending was intended for the film, yet after proving itself unpopular with test audiences, Hughes switched it). The script is full of clichs and not a shred of chemistry exists between Ringwald and McCarthy. The film's only redeeming qualities are in the performances of its supporting cast and its totally awesome soundtrack. James Spader is perfect as McCarthy's best friend Steff, the obnoxious self-entitled snob we love to hate. Annie Potts is divine as nostalgia-ridden Iona, Andie's coworker/mother figure, and Cryer's Duckie evokes sympathy, bemusement, and at times intense irritation.

Despite the film's obvious misgivings, Pretty in Pink is highly entertaining and contains some of Hughes' best one-liners. It's hard to judge how this generation will react to an '80s classic such as this one given its dated look and obvious dialogue. Kids will undoubtedly poke fun at Andie's disastrous sense of fashion, in particular her prom dress, which resembles a pink burlap sack. One thing they most certainly will marvel at is a scene where Blane flirts with Andie using a crude form of instant messenger.

Absolutely hated these movies, especially because my girl friend at the time loved them and of course I had to give in to taking her to see them. Now thirty years later my 13 year old daughter and wife have rediscovered these gems of the eighties. I am enduring the pain all over again!  But I can't deny that I've always liked James Spader and Molly. Can't stand Cryer at all these days but his performance in Pretty in Pink is his best. Can't stand Andrew McCarthy. I just want to put some bleach on the floor and mop him up. Thank god his career ended so long ago. This is a classic Eighties movie though.

276373,4,6300214710,"One last collaboration for John Hughes and Molly Ringwald, whose creative partnership dissolved after this film. Somewhat softer and more self-serious than the preceding teen epics Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, it tackles social cliques and classism from various perspectives. Ringwald and leading man Andrew McCarthy, akin to Romeo and Juliet, find their young relationship stressed by the negative influence of friends who insist they find someone closer to their own status. There really isn't much sparkle to the pairing, though, apart from a few awkward make-out scenes, and they both come off as especially wet noodles in comparison to the vibrant, brash supporting cast. Jon Cryer is most memorable of these as Duckie, a flamboyant mod who's been carrying a torch for Ringwald all his life, and nearly steals the film with an abrupt dance/lip-sync number just before everything gets overly angsty. Most of the third act is wasted on hand-wringing and moping, alas, and the ending (changed at the last minute, much to Hughes's chagrin) feels disingenuous even if it does make a better fit for the movie's theme. The window dressings are drowned in '80s flavor, too, from the appropriately synthy soundtrack to the Halloween-grade costume choices. Looks like everyone at this school was either Don Johnson, Sid Vicious or Morrissey.",1467331200,,1347,5.269767441860465

276470,3,6300214710,"Released in 1986, Pretty in Pink stars Molly Ringwald as a working class eccentric at a Los Angeles high school. She finds herself stuck between her likable, but annoyingly obsessive friend, Duckie (Jon Cryer), and a rich preppie with whom she shares affection (Andrew McCarthy). Harry Dean Stanton plays her struggling father, Annie Potts her older mentor at the record store where she works and James Spader the preppies snooty friend. Andrew Dice Clay is on hand for a brief role.

This is not a zany, fun high school dramedy, like 1984s Sixteen Candles; its too brooding and dramatic, which isn't to say it doesnt have comedic touches. The first hour is relatively flat, hampered by a feeling of un-reality, particularly Andie & Blanes horrible first date. Blanes decision to go to his snooty rich friends party is bad; and his decision to continue to hang around when its clear Andie cant stand it there is stupefying. The original ending was reshot after test audience responded badly to the outcome. For me, it makes sense, the actual ending to the movie, not the rejected one. The movies not as good as Sixteen Candles (which wasn't great in the first place), but Im giving it a marginal thumbs up.

The movie runs 96 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area.

Some actors obviously struggled with the idiotic dialog (James Spader, who's insanely gorgeous in this film). Others flew with the dialog, and really brought it to life (Jon Cryer, Annie Potts).
Definitely worth watching to marvel at the inexplicable twists and turns (which made no sense back in the 1980's either, trust me).",1452470400,4,484,4.987654320987654

276776,2,6300214710,"Pretty in Pink has achieved something of cult status among fans of the 1980s teen movie genre and I generally love John Hughes movies because I think that he had a pronounced vision into the condition of young adults in the 1980s. But I just never got the point of Pretty in Pink. While the Molly Ringwald character and her father were okay, the rest of the film came across as an attempt at this rich guy-poor girl love story that is dictated by the pressures of social class and expectations.

But instead you get this rich guy who comes across as a total jerk and Ducky comes across as this annoying person that I really cant figure out how has achieved such a lofty status over the last thirty or so years (although Jon Cryer did play him quite well). Why should I root for any of these people to achieve their end goal and that ending just felt like it didn't come together at all at the end of the day.

When I bought this dvd I was hoping for an original ending and what I got was the sappy, boring one.
O gosh, Blane is such a bore. I don't know if he always was like that or maybe I'm too old for rooting for a pretty, poor rich boy. I'm 30, I need some personality in a guy, not a fancy car and great hair.
The movie is still great, I felt like a teenager, when I first saw it so many years ago. It's great to watch a movie so different than contemporary high-school movies.

276854,5,6300214710,"The young adult social experience was well represented by the work of John Hughes, and Pretty In Pink has become quite the classic. High school social status will forever be part of growing up, and struggles with individuality and conformity are issues all people can relate to. Whilst some aspects of the films plot might be considered too innocent, the fact remains crossing boundaries can be represented in a number of ways, and following the heart and mind over peer pressure is a wonderful message.

276997,5,6300214710,"Writer John Hughes crafts an exemplary Brat Pack romance out of the standard Cinderella story in Pretty in Pink as it is about teenage love and social cliques in 1980's American high schools.

Andie Walsh is a teenager who lives in the dingy part of town with her terminally underemployed dad. She works at a record store with eccentric Ionia and is considered a misfit at her uppity high school, but somehow she rises above them all. Her oddball best friend, Duckie, is hopelessly in love with her, so he causes trouble for her romantic pursuits. When local rich kid Blaine develops a fascination with her, they go out on a date together. Visiting the home bases of each social clique, they are basically ridiculed for their audacity to date one another. When Blaine eventually asks the delighted Andie to the prom, he is threatened by his rich friend Steff. The romance versus high school social politics finally culminates at the big night of the prom.

Pretty in Pink is a rather intelligent look at adolescent insecurities as it provides an understanding of class structure, of culture and counter-culture and the ways that teenagers can destroy one another over the subtle distinctions therein. Although it is clichd and stereotyped, it is remarkably sentimental, and sweet as all get-out. And most of all,it manages to leave an imprint to the viewer.",1419033600,,1357,4.895652173913043

I looked at the front cover and always wondered who exactly was ""Pretty in Pink""?
And what became of her.

After watching the film it is obvious that Molly Ringwall is the culprit.

Life turns out pretty good for her.

Pucky on the other hand is what embodies the experience of the typical American Male today.

Just cool dudes, being mad cool/funny/sensitive.
But that ain't enough.

Good enough to be a real cool friend and confidant.

I know there is a version of this film where Pucky wins.
But it was shelved.

And I am glad.

It's just one more slap in the face.

Who is Pretty in Pink.

It could be you.

277174,5,6300214710,"When I first saw this movie as a young lass, I couldn't get into the movie. The outfits, the hair just seemed so....ridiculous. How do you take James Spader's character seriously with that feathered monstrosity perched atop his head? Also, I found Andrew McCarthy's wide eyed gaze disconcerting.

Revisiting the film with a slightly apathetic attitude, I saw the ""light"", or the genius behind the story. John Hughes captures teenage struggles arguably better than any other writer of his age. Who can't empathize with Andy, and understand the social constraints that grip two kids from completely different cliques?

Maybe it's because I'm older and the inevitable onset of nostalgia has kicked in, but I LOVE the style in this movie. It's a snapshot of a time like no other, when ""more is more"" was the mantra for accessorizing and elevated hairdos. No one can mistake this movie for any other time period than the mid '80's.",1403049600,,926,4.92948717948718

The message was in finding security in herself, despite the criticism of judgmental classmates, but in the end she ditches a loyal (but overly needy) friend to find validation in the shallow jerk who tooled her around, thus undermining the whole message.  She should have ditched both of them and found security in herself.  It's just high school -- move on and get a life in college!

It is so heartwarming to see how this teen daughter  copes with school,
pushing her dad to work, and also working part time.
The unbelievable talent she displays in designing her own wardrobe.
How she is envied by classmates and how she manages to ignore
all the negativities of living on the ""Wrong sideOf the tracks"" supported by
a boy that she only views as a good friend. It has the  cute happy ending
that you are expecting and hoping for.

The whole ending is centered around prom where her BFF is super sweet and escorts her to prom, just to be ditched 30 seconds after walking through the door b/c the rich guy that she's been on 2 dates says that he loves her (after initially ditching out on going to the prom with her b/c his friends didn't approve.)

That's funny right.  I don't like a show, but I'd recommend it.  The movie is a cult classic.  It's well-done, and I like the time period.  I just wasn't interested in the plot.  I was also in a slump at time and not receptive to love themes.  I suspect if I go back to this movie, I'd like it.

Basic synopsis: girl falls into a love triangle when a rich boy takes note of her, vying with her life-long friend for her affections.  I never liked that theme.  It's medieval, and I get a bad flash-black to Camelot, where Guinevere was singing about knights spilling their blood for her. It's all very creepy, gentlemen - women who like men brawling over her has serious issues and a need for profound psychological assistance.  Don't hate on me, Amazon review reviewers, you know it's true!

And then I rewatched it because of Auschwitz and The Blacklist and I am reminded all along that there is something wrong with Andrew McCarthy and even if James Spader is portraying evil - everything he does WARNS everyone to not go near this group of elitists whereas Andrew McCarthy never puts Molly Ringwald at ease but claims to be a friendly face.

This movie still feels OFF after all these years but I really appreciate more how mean and articulate James Spader is here.  Too bad there isn't a movie where he plays this kind of villain thoroughly and brazenly.  His subsequent roles were as benevolent leading men.",1387670400,,696,4.626016260162602

277377,5,6300214710,Superlative!!!The movie accurately captures the high school insecurity angst of the popular rich kids.  Movement between the cliques is still based on the feudual lord (James Spader) approval.  High School social hierarchy is still based on medieval feudalism.  Great directing and acting is represented by the longevity of the principal actors in the fickle Hollywood business.  Writing is fresh and comical with catchy phrases.  May I admire you.  I am forever you duck man.  Classic.  Musical score is great with OMD and New Ordr. I would have added Boys Don't Cry by The Cure.,1386547200,,580,5.095744680851064

277927,4,6300214710,"I am probably alone in liking ""Pretty in Pink"" better than ""Sixteen Candles"" or ""The Breakfast Club"".  I liked the characters a great deal, and thought the cast was superb.  It's hard for me to pick out my favorite performance in this ensemble cast -- they all work so well together, and some of the supporting roles are better than the two headliners, Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy.  The other main character, Jon Cryer as the doormat boyfriend-wannabe Duckie, is charming, funny, and for me, a total heart-melter.

Andi (Molly Ringwald) falls for Blaine (""That's not a name, that's a major appliance,"" says Duckie in one of many memorable one-liners), played charmingly by Andrew McCarthy.  It's the classic tale of the rich guy/girl and poor guy/girl falling in love and finding more obstacles against their relationship than they could have even imagined.  Nothing new here, but again, the performances, the music, the great 80's fashions, and the catchy dialogue make it far more interesting than it could have been.

James Spader is deliciously detestable as McCarthy's best rich pal/enemy (how could Blaine not have seen what was driving his venom?), Harry Dean Stanton gives nuance as Andi's hopelessly heartbroken father, and Annie Potts just about steals the show as Andi's pretty older co-worker, wisecracking friend.  I was enjoying the movie shamelessly, then was so disappointed in the predictably easy, feel-good ending.  The writers, producers, and director all took the easy way out, and who can blame them?  They are in it to make money, not art.  It would have been better as a thoughtful indie movie with a more realistic ending, but then they probably couldn't have gotten all those A-list brat pack actors.

Its not quite the par of ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""16 Candles"" or ""St Elmo's Fire"" but if you enjoyed any of those movies, you will enjoy this one. However, it makes me wonder, Why did some of these actors disappear for so many years. Like Andrew McCarthy and Molly Ringwald who I feel did a very good job of acting in each of her movies. I also didn't remember how annoying the character Ducky really was. He's like an annoying loser and yet almost seems like someone Johnny Deep may have look to for his quirky styleing cues and attire.

""Duckie""'s role is played well, but that's about it in my opinion. The rest of the acting and the movie isn't as great ""for me"".

278142,4,6300214710,"This movie is redeemed from the formulaic nature of its plot -- can poor girl and rich guy really make it together -- by some really appealing performances.  Jon Cryer, Annie Potts, and Molly Ringwald never did better work: the young James Spader is marvelous sleaze, and a very fine actor, Harry Dean Stanton, plays Molly's dad as a man totally unmanned by his wife's having left him.  However, he ends up as the voice of wisdom (if less-than-standard grammar)in the movie: ""You can love someone, but it doesn't mean they'll love you back.""  His articulation of this to Molly gives her the strength to suck it up and go to the Prom alone, and it's clearly the moment that he realizes something about himself, and in our last shot of him we see him putting his wife's photo in a drawer.  The pacing of the movie couldn't be better, and the integration of the musical score with the action is great (as is the music itself, for this movie).  Any disappointments?  Only one, I think -- Andrew McCarthy just isn't a credible object of desire.",1356134400,,1039,4.559139784946237

Pretty in Pink is my favorite Molly Ringwald romance movie.  Molly's acting is really good.  She played really well as the middle class teenage girl - Andie.

Jon Cryer will always be ""Ducky"" to me.  I like this actor a lot.  I think that it was his acting in ""Two and a Half Men"" that has kept the show going.

Andrew McCarthy portrayed the perfect rich boy heartthrob. The chemistry between Molly and Andrew was believable.",1355443200,,636,4.548672566371682

278148,3,6300214710,"This is that one film that has been redone a thousand times, especially by Freddie Prince Jr. in the mid-90's, and so even though I saw it for the first time this past weekend, it was like I had seen it a thousand times before.  That said, the film is so generically 80's that it was almost like a breath of fresh air.  I relished in the dated quality of the film because it made it feel new and different.  Sadly, Ringwald is dull as a doornail and she really drags this film down a couple pegs.  I just couldn't invest in her because she bored me to tears.  Thankfully the rich supporting cast brought the film up, with Jon Cryer, James Spader and Annie Potts nailing their roles and grabbing our attention.  Cryer's take on `Try a Little Tenderness' was the film's biggest highlight, and Spader's perfected soullessness is fun to watch.  I felt like the script was really skeletal in parts, almost laughably so.  When Andie has this heart to heart with her dad about her mother leaving them, it felt so underwritten it was pathetic.  Still, the predictability factor doesn't hinder the smile on my face, it was the boring leads that did that.  It's funny to see what Cryer has become.  Ah, 80's nostalgia.  Gotta have it or make it stop?  Despite the fact that this film gets a middling grade from me, it's an enthusiastic one so I'll vote `gotta have it' and settle in for yet another 80's classic!",1349049600,,1402,4.450980392156863

278202,5,6300214710,"Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks. She's a self-confident high-school senior who dresses in handmade clothes, works in a record store, and lives in a modest home with her unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton). Times are tough for Andie in school, where she and her friends are tormented by the wealthy students who make up the majority of the student body, and where her worst fear is that she won't get invited to the senior prom. Her best friend, ""Duckie"" (Jon Cryer), talks matter-of-factly with her father about marrying Andie, but he never thinks of taking her to the prom--a social event that most of the poor kids avoid. To her surprise, she is asked to go to the dance by the charming Blaine (Andrew McCarthy), who's not as snobbish as the rest of his elitist friends. As in all of John Hughes's films, PRETTY IN PINK touches a chord with today's teens (as well as anyone who has been that age), but at the same time seems to pander somewhat to the audience's expectations. Interestingly, however, the finest moments in PRETTY IN PINK come not from the script by Hughes, but from Howard Deutch's careful direction. While the script contains trite and unbelievable dialogue, the superbly convincing performances make up for these faults",1331683200,2,1282,4.7792792792792795

Of course, now that I'm older, I'm more interested in James Spader (i.e. Steff).  He's a total jerk in this one, but still completely James Spader!!  Love Love Loved Boston Legal!!

But I digress... this is the original story about the spunky outsider who rises above the snobby popular kids.  John Hughes classic, and very 1980s.  Hilarious, and great 1980s hair, fashion, and music.

My only problem?  The prom dress.  I wanted to cry when I saw it. I still can't believe Andie destroyed a gorgeous vintage dress to create that lacy pink...sausage!",1322697600,,690,4.666666666666667

It is actually the director and actors talking through the behind the scene filming where you simply see Molly Ringwald and Jon Cryer standing at prom holding hands with the cameras and microphones swirling around them. They repeat these images numerous times while there is commentary to fill the visual space. It was a disappointment as I expected to see an actual scene acted out with the characters.

278262,4,6300214710,"You know, I just finished watching Pretty In Pink with Molly Ringwald, Jon Cryer, & Andrew McCarthy. I love, love, love the movie. The music just totally saves it for me. The Furs, OMD, Echo, & even some Manilow. Ok, I'm a Fanilow so I have to admit to liking the man's music. Don't shoot me. INXS, New Order, MORRISSEY. Some serious good music compiled. I remember owning the tape (totally dating myself now) and playing it until it stretched beyond repair, or maybe the tape deck ate it? Either way, once upon a time I owned the soundtrack. New quest: regain music soundtrack.

The storyline is your typical John Hughes 80's storyline. That I can cope with. I am after all a child of the 80's and still think it was the greatest decade to date for music. But that's just MHO. One thing though. I can get over Andie's (Molly Ringwald) annoying lips and bad teeth.  Blane's (Andrew McCarthy) inability to man-up in the movie (seriously why does Andie go back to Blane after he wimped out on her? Disaster!) I still don't understand why Duckie (Jon Cryer) was not given the respect he like totally deserved. I mean after all he is the Duck Man! Duckie has the best lines throughout the whole flick...yeah, I went there. Flick.

What I cannot and will not get over is Andies dress. I mean seriously. She's supposed to be this phenomenal sewer, a worker of miracles. She screw's up the courage to show up to prom with no +1 and her high noon showdown dress is that? I remember back in the day when I originally saw this movie at the theatre by the bowling alley...ALHS people, you know the one I'm talkin bout...seriously she wore that unflattering thing? I just don't get it even to this day. I mean seriously. She had the potential to really wow them and let them know she is not a loser, but she shows up in that pink on pink polka dot sack? Bad show. Now Duckie on the other hand...looked Sharp! Go Duckie!

Even though I once again experienced the sad disappointment that is/was Andies showdown dress I still had a good time listening to the great music of my generation. I will of course watch again. Need to repurchase the DVD/Blu-Ray. Now to start out on my soundtrack quest....

When they release the film on DVD with the original ending of Andy and Duckie together, only then will I buy the DVD.

The soundtrack I don't need, I have that for years.  Was a big New Order long before, didn't really like Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.  Left of Center (Suzanne Vega/Joe Jackson) was my life story in high school.  Oh the memories.",1250121600,6,721,4.343283582089552
278323,5,6300214710,"Molly Ringwald is pretty in pink, though she is gorgeous no matter what shade she wears. Andie Walsh in PIP is Molly's signature role. You'd think that a film titled Pretty in Pink would be all about the clothes, but apart from the pink prom dress she put together by combining two vintage dresses, I preferred her wardrobe from 16 Candles or The Breakfast Club. Besides, she was out dressed at every turn by Duckie (Jon Cryer) and Iona (Annie Potts).

Duckie is her blatant admirer who rides by her house about 100 times a day on his bike. Does he ever park? No, he is more of a drive-by kind of guy. He appreciates her sense of fashion, because his own is even quirkier. They both like to work those hats.

--------------------------
Duckie: May I admire you again today?
=============================================

They have a close friendship, though it is obvious that Duckie wants more. ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" by The Smiths, and heard on the soundtrack, could serve as his anthem. Jon Cryer was a fabulous Duckie with all his ducks in a row. This is his best role, and the one he will be remembered for, apart from playing Alan Harper in the syndicated sit com Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen. He was such a cute kid. What happened?

---------------------------
Andie: So what do you want to drink?
Duckie: Oh you know, beer, scotch, juice box... whatever.
============================================

Cryer had another great sit com but no one saw it, a great show about two architects called Partners that only lasted one season. Cryer was Bob (22 episodes, 1995-1996). Does anyone besides me remember this show?

Besides out dressing Ringwald -- his tuxedo even trumps her pink dress at the prom -- Cryer and Potts almost steal the show with their romance. They nearly hijacked PIP and made it into the sequel to HAM (Harold and Maude).

--------------------
Duckie: You know what an older woman does for me?
Iona: Changes your diapers?
Duckie: Touch&eacute;.
==============================

Iona keeps Duckie at bay with her wisecracks, but after Duckie kisses Iona to make Andie jealous, Duckie and Iona almost hook up. This train derails when she starts dating a yuppie pet shop owner who arrives suddenly like some kind of deus ex machina.

Annie Potts as Iona was the coolest vintage record store owner in Chicago since Rob Gordon in High Fidelity. She is a perpetual adolescent and surrogate mother/cool boss to Andie Walsh, always there for her with a quick quip or a shoulder to cry on. She is the perfect mixture of mother and best friend for a post-date recap:

---------------------------------
Andie: Well, not nothing. I mean, I kissed him...
Iona: Anywhere interesting?
===========================================

Her unique fashion sense is all the stranger coming from someone who would play Interior Decorator Mary Jo Shively in 151 episodes of ""Designing Women"" from 1986-1993. Iona lives in a Chinese Restaurant converted into her humble abode with a lot of the original decor intact. Besides her outrageous clothes, she also has a passion for wigs that borders on the criminal. Indeed, she was in Ken Russell's Crimes of Passion, and one of her wigs looks like it was stolen from China Blue.

Harry Dean Stanton was good as Andie's father, who is still not over Andie's mother leaving. Andie has to push him to get out of bed in the morning and look for a better job. She has taken over the parent role, in a way, and dishes out the tough love. Still, they have great rapport. Repo Man and Paris, Texas are the must-see Harry Dean Stanton roles.

Andrew McCarthy was OK but not great as Blane, the richie who faced a lot of pressure when he tried to date a poorie. The issue was would he go against the grain and date Andie in spite of parental and peer pressure, but what did Andie see in Blane, anyway?

-------------------
Andie: You know you're talking like that just because I'm going out with Blane.
Duckie: His name is Blane? Oh! That's a major appliance, that's not a name!
=========================================

I don't know about a major appliance, but Blane is kind of a tool. McCarthy and Ringwald were also together in Fresh Horses, where Molly is even poorer, and Ben Stiller is the rich friend who tries to steer him away from Ringwald. Fresh Horses focuses much more on McCarthy, with Ringwald's Jewell being a mysterious figure that may or may not be married. Is she a real Jewell or merely costume jewelry? In Fresh Horses, the gap between the two is much wider, and harder for McCarthy's character to bridge. He is studying to be an architect, but she is a backwoods yahoo. Even the test audiences felt that they shouldn't get together.

James Spader was good in PIP as the rich jerk, Steff. Spader has a similar role to the one he played in PIP in The Rachel Papers, were he plays the rival for Ione Skye's affections. He makes a good jerk, but would later branch out to more sympathetic and complex roles, like the naive innocent under the Bad Influence of Rob Lowe. His break out role would have to be sex, lies, and video tape.

John Hughes wrote Pretty in Pink but didn't direct it. Don't fall for that trick trivia question. Howard Deutch was the director, and it was Deutch's directorial debut. Since PIP is practically a sequel to 16 Candles it is fitting that Deutch would go on to direct three sequels for which he hadn't directed the original films (Grumpier Old Men, The Odd Couple II, & The Whole Ten Yards).

The audience at the test screening didn't buy Duckie and Andie getting together at the end, so the studio made them change it. They had to call back the actors to reshoot, even though McCarthy had shaved his head for his next film. He had to wear one of Iona's wigs. Hughes wanted to keep his original ending, and later made Some Kind of Wonderful (1987), almost a remake of PIP, just so he could do the ending he wanted. Hughes wanted Ringwald to do SKOW, but she wisely refused to reprise her role yet again, resulting in a falling out and they never worked together afterwards.

If Robert Downey Jr. had been cast as Duckie, it might have ended with Andie and Duckie getting together, because Downey, unlike Cryer, didn't give Molly a brotherly vibe. Downey Jr. is the only one I can think of who could have escaped the friend bag Duckie was stuck in. Anthony Michael Hall couldn't get out of his friend bag in 16 Candles, and he was offered the role of Duckie but wisely turned it down. Dweezil Zappa, who played Simon in PIP, was actually Molly's boyfriend at the time. Would the test audience have bought them as a couple?

Besides Dweezil, keep your eye out for Gina Gershon and Andrew 'Dice' Clay. Clay is the bouncer at Trax, the night club where the PIP crew hang. If you are ever asked who the bouncer in Flashdance was, it wasn't the dice man, but Lee Ving, the singer of So Cal punk group Fear. I could have sworn it was Andrew.

New Order, Echo & the Bunnymen, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, INXS, along with the title track by The Psychedelic Furs gave this film the quintessential 80's vibe, but it also used older songs like ""Copacabana (At the Copa)"" by Barry Manilow, ""Try a Little Tenderness"" by Otis Redding, and ""Cherish"" by The Association to its advantage.

Pretty in Pink is a classic High School romance, and it also owns the 80's. Pretty in Pink is to the 80's what Reality Bites is to the 90's. It is a high point of the Hughes oeuvre, even if he didn't direct, but merely wrote it. I think the ending is fine, even if Hughes didn't. Besides Molly Ringwald being so pretty in pink, you also have Cryer and Potts. Who could ask for more?

278324,3,6300214710,"The Bottom Line:

It's a John Hughes teen film starring Molly Ringwald, so you know what you're getting before you walk in: there'll be some drama, some overacting, some unmanipulative and interesting material undermined by attempts at broad humor, and an ending designed to make everyone leave with a smile on his or her face, regardless of the logical contortions required to make it happen: watch it if that appeals to you.",1244505600,,426,4.916666666666667
278325,4,6300214710,"Continuing on with my 80's movies reviews I started a month or so ago with ""Can't Buy Me Love"", comes this classic John Hughes/Molly Ringwald film from 1986, and directed by Howard Deutch. PIP comes at a time when Hughes'teen/high school work of the 80's would soon be coming, sadly, to an end. While there are a few other works of his in this vein that I prefer(Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club), that isn't to say PIP isn't worthy of being part of the best of the group. It is. It definitley is. And now, we get the ultimate DVD version of the film. There have been others on the market, but the ""Everything Dcukie"" edition is the one stop shopping for your Pretty In Pink needs. Let's move on....

Perennial Hughes favorite Molly Ringwald, plays high school senior Andi Walsh, an intelligent girl with her own distinct style of clothing and way of life. She is not 'popular' at school and comes from the wrong side of the tracks, where she lives with her father(Harry Dean Stanton). She has her best friend Duckie(Jon Cryer, ""Two And A Half Men""), who loves her, a job at a cool record store(before CD's kids!), and a friend, Iona, who runs the place(played by the wonderful Annie Potts). Andi's life soon changes when rich and popular Blane(Andrew McCarthy)takes a shining to her, amidst the ridicule from his popular, cool friends, among them the loathsome Steff(James Spader). What is a girl to do?.

For starters, this is a great cast. With Ringwald and McCarthy, you get some familiar faces that are not new to the teen/school genre, and many argue that this is the best film for each. Elsewhere, there is James Spader, who does a credible job as the despicable Steff. Even though Steff is the typical 80's/rich/super cool/mr. popular/slimeball, Spader really deserves some credit for not only bringing all of that to cinematic life, but for making it believeable. He is slime, and there is not one moment he is on screen that you don't feel it. He did a great job. Annie Potts is wonderful and adorable in her role, and she brightens the preceedings whenever she is on screen. Her and Andi have a great relationship as friends, and even though she is a bit older, there might be a 'mother-ly' connection Andi finds in her as well. Speaking of the parental unit, there is Harry Dean Stanton. He does a fine job, but is it me or does it seem just kinda weird to see him playing the warm dad in a teen friendly 80's comedy/drama?. No matter, he is still exceptional here. And, oh yes, this brings us to the character that Jon Cryer will forever be addressed as even when he is in his 80's. The one and only Duckie. Cryer has done some great comedic work on his sitcom, but Duckie is his best work. He's a great character, and Cryer really makes him come across as real and loveable, even when the character does and says some not so loveable things. Cryer is wonderful, and his dance in the record shop is classic. A great cast.

But how is the rest of the movie?. Just as fun and enjoyable as it's wonderful cast!. The premise of the film may not be anything new, but hey, anything is good 10 times over if it is done well, with the right characters, the right writing, and the right actors to pull it off. PIP was lucky with John Hughes penning the script, so it's going to be better than an average 80's teen flick, and the characters were real and relatable. The movie really captures that feel and essence of certain hierarchy at high schools, the lesser individuals below them, and how they intertwine with each other and get along...or, not get along, as the case may be. The film and it's script ring very truthful in that area, and even though there may be some characters you expect to see in a movie such as this, the characters don't seem like cardboard rip-offs, but their own individual selves. The movie may have some romance and drama, but it also has a nice balance of humor, mostly from Duckie or at his expense, that feels natural. In fact, most of the movie feels natural, even though there will be some who will still question rich guy Blane's interest in Andi. As for how it all turns out, well, it could of gone either way. John Hughes wanted one thing, the director and producers wanted and expected the audience to want another thing. I liked the way the movie ended(even if Hughes didn't), but I will not spoil it for you if you have not seen it yet.

The ""Everything Duckie"" edition has, well, everything you could want. Where to start?. There is a great selection of bonus material here, and you get over 90 minutes worth!. For starters, there is ""The First Time: The Making Of Pretty In Pink"", which is a nicely done documentary that is pretty self explanatory. A featurette on Ringwald called ""Prom Queen: All About Molly"". ""Volcanic Ensembles"" is a piece on, you guessed it, the wild fashion that is on showcase in the film. So very 80's, and that's why it's so cool. People tell their own stories of that special night in every senior's life with ""Prom Stories"". More goodies to come!. ""Favorite Scenes"" has cast and crew commenting on, well, their favorite scenes. You also get the original ending titled ""The Last Dance"". If that's not enough, there is also a featurette titled ""Zoids And Riches"", ""Wrap up: The Epilogue"", a photo gallery, and a commentary with director Howard Deutch. Surprisingly, since everything else is on here, there is no trailer for the film.

""Pretty In Pink"" comes from that special, magical time known as the 80's. Before Miley, Jonas, and Britney, there was Ringwald, McCarthy, and Duckie. ""Pretty In Pink"" is a classic piece of 1980's John Hughes/teen comedy goodness. It holds a place alongside some of the more revered films of his and the times, but deserves a place nonetheless. It was nicely written, well acted, and deliverd an enjoyable viewing experience. All that and a truck load of special features?. How can it fail?!. It can't.

(May Contain Spoilers)

Andie Walsh, (Molly Ringwald) lives with her unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton) in the wrong side of town. Andie is a very headstrong girl who isn't very well liked with any of her peers exept her friend Jenna and Duckie Dale, (Jon Cryer) the boy next door that would do anything for her. She and Duckie are often made fun of by the popular kids, especially Steff, (James Spader). But one popular guy Blaine, (Andrew McCarthey) has been secretly lusting after Andie.

Andie works at Trax, a new wave music store with her older on the outside friend Iona, (Annie Potts) who advises Andie to go to her prom despite not having a date to enjoy it with. Blaine then comes in to buy an album and they talk briefly. In the computer lab next day at school, Andie realizes that she is falling for Blaine and vice versa. Blaine then breaks the social barrier to ask Andie out on a date, much to his buddy Steff's dismay. Andie's buddy Duckie doesn't approve either. Unfortunately, Andie and Blaine have to deal with the wrath of the student body for their relationship. Prom is coming up and the peer pressure suddenly gets to Blaine, leaving Andie dateless. Blaine decides to ignore all of his peers and goes back to Andie on prom night and after a little covincing from Duckie, Andie goes back to Blaine.

Molly Ringwald has great acting skills and it really shows in this movie. Jon Cryer really puts on a great performance as Duckie and Andrew McCarthy, Annie Potts, James Spader and Harry Dean Stanton do a fantastic job in their roles. The superb acting makes this movie a must see.

The ""Everything's Duckie Edition"" includes new interviews with the cast, a featurette about Molly and her work with John Hughes in the 80s, a featurette about the cast's prom stories and great archive footage from the making of the movie in 1985. The biggest flaw with this DVD is that the orignial ending where Andie and Duckie end up as a couple is not included. Instead, there is an interview on why the ending was cut. Other than that, Pretty in Pink fans should get this DVD. This great 80s film should not be missed!

278386,4,6300214710,"I didn't see ""Pretty and Pink"" in the 1980s, but the film's enduring popularity motivated me to take a look 22 years hence. ""Pretty in Pink""  is part of John Hughes' oeuvre of '80s teen flicks, even though Hughes did not direct the film. Hughes wrote and produced; Howard Deutch makes his feature film debut directing. As was common with John Hughes films, the plot is simple and silly. The substance is supposed to be in the behavior. Unlike his other films, I think that Hughes achieved more with casting in ""Pretty and Pink"" than with dialogue or behavior, which accounts for its staying power. The film is a showcase of early work for a lot of big names.

The plot is lifted straight out of Cinderella. Andie (Molly Ringwald) is a barely working class high school senior with a terminally unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton). She's responsible, ambitious, and doesn't let poverty stand between herself and a trendy wardrobe. She sews her own over-the-top '80s fashions. Andie's greatest wish is that dreamy rich boy Blane (Andrew McCarthy) will invite her to the prom, but the only rich boy who has paid her attention so far is Blane's rakish friend Steff (James Spader). Andie's eccentric friend since childhood, Duckie (Jon Cryer), pines after her, but seems destined to friend status.

""Pretty and Pink"" doesn't resonate the way that many of John Hughes' teen movies did. I grew up poor and attended a rich high school, like Andie, but the way the characters interact in this movie doesn't ring true to me. It's a fairy tale. It's not a situation that people can relate to. The film's strength is its cast. Individually, the characters are appealing and interesting: Blane, the nice, handsome preppy. Steff, the licentious, handsome jerk. Annie Potts has a great role as Iona, Andie's colorful friend and employer. If the audience sympathizes with anyone, it is probably with Duckie, played to the hilt by Jon Cryer.

Molly Ringwald was well-suited to most of her teen roles, but I'm not enthusiastic about her in this part. Ironically, the film was written for Ringwald, but somehow I just do not buy it. Andie seems contrived, and her emotions fall flat for me. It's also disappointing to see teens played by older actors. Molly Ringwald was the only real teenager. James Spader must have been about 25. But this is a memorable cast, nonetheless. Andrew Dice Clay has a cameo, and you can catch Gina Gershon, Dweezil Zappa, and Kristy Swanson in non-speaking roles. Cinematography is by the talented Tak Fujimoto. ""Pretty in Pink"" is fun, but you'll be thinking about the iconic characters and ignoring everything else.

The DVD (Paramount 2006): The ""Everything's Duckie Edition"" is loaded with 8 featurettes, a Photo Gallery, and a feature commentary. Most of the featurettes include ""then and now"" interviews, taking footage from interviews with cast and crew in 1985 and in 2006. John Hughes is the only one not featured in any contemporary interviews. ""The First Time: The Making of Pretty in Pink"" (13 min) interviews director Howard Deutch, John Hughes, producer Lauren Shuler, and the cast about making the movie, the music, novice directorial mistakes, and the photography. ""Zoids and Richies"" (19 min) interviews cast and crew about characters and includes interesting stuff about casting.  ""Prom Queen: All About Molly"" (13 min) interviews Molly Ringwald et al about the character of Andie, her situation, her crush, etc.

""Volcanic Ensembles"" (9 min) interviews costume designer Marilyn Vance and actors about the wardrobes. In ""Prom Stories"" (3 min), some cast and crew talk about their proms. ""Favorite Scenes"" (20 min) replays 8 memorable scenes from the movie followed by comments from the cast. ""The Lost Dance: The Original Ending"" (12 min) is about how and why the film's ending was changed. In ""Wrap Up: Epilogue"" (7 min), cast and crew comment on the film's enduring popularity.  The commentary by  director Howard Deutch is not constant but discusses the characters, interacting with the actors, John Hughes' role, themes, staging, editing, production design, and some other technical details.

Enter rich kid Blaine (Andrew McCarthy ,not as snobbish as the others in his set and who woos Andie, a process not without its ups and downs and which divides him from his friends especially McKee .The theme of money and class runs through this movie very clearly and helps make the movie less sugary than it might otherwise have been .
The performances are good especially from Stanton who brings a welcome touch os astringency to the role .The John Hughes script is fine and Howard Deutch directs expertly aided by a well chosen 80's soundtrack(which I did not like as it is not my musical thing but it does suit the movie well and that is the prime consideration ,surely)

Duckie is her best friend who also happens to be in love with her...although at times is borderline obsessed.
Blane is the cute, rich guy who seems to have a little more depth and charisma than his friends...who also falls in love with her.
Steff is, well just Steff. The cool guy who wears the preppy jackets, baggy pants and smokes in the hallway.
Duckie, Blane and Steff all fight for Andie's affections, but in the end Andie goes with her heart and ends up with Blane.
A lot of PIP fans wanted her with Duckie, but as the movie taught sometimes you can love someone a lot and they just don't love you back.

Being an outcast through highschool, Andy (Molly Ringwald), is a budding designer and she makes up all of her clothes, but gets ridiculed by the popular girls. Who doesn't get teased? But Andy likes Blane, a rich kid who has money and hangs out with the popular crowd. Then there is Duckie, Andy's loyal friend who is totally in love with her, and is against Andy wanting to go out with Blane, as he thinks he will break her heart. And there is Stef (James Spader), who wants Andy, but Andy does not want him. So Stef gets to Blane trying to make out that Andy is crazy and that she is not worth dating. But Blane still likes her. They go out on a few dates, and then he pulls away from her and she gets angry. Then the prom comes, and Duckie takes Andy to the prom and tells her that Blane is a nice guy and not like the others. So Blane sees Andy and she is upset. he walks up to her and tell sher that he loves her. Then he walks away. Andy stares after him, and Duckie tells her to go after him.

I'm surprised at how many people still tell me they never watched this movie!

James Spader plays the extreme a-hole and there's no bigger jerk in all of movies!  Molly Ringwald is the quintessential '80s girl acting along with some amazing songs in the background. You also have a quirky ""She's so Unusual"" type performance from Annie Potts (Janine Melnitz from Ghostbusters), an Oscar worthy showing from Andrew Dice Clay, and even a hot Kristy Swanson as Duckette.

I just think it would've been cool if the Andie character could've showed some kind of solidarity and YES loyalty to Duckie--the ONE (if not) ONLY friend that she had at her school and stayed with HIM at the prom--I mean, let's face it, she was Blane's for the taking and then suddenly he didn't want her anymore, but then to sorta wrap things up, he develops some kind of conscience or thick skin or whatever and decides he wants her back and like clockwork, the Andie character is all eager to take him back? I mean, what about Duckie?  What about his feelings?  Don't worry Duckie, I'm with you all the way--the Andie character missed out on the only good thing she had!

278447,2,6300214710,"Pretty in Pink, an 80's teen dramedy may have a FEW worthy moments but it's mostly full of hot air. While I'm a HUGE fan of 80's teen movies (and 80's movies in general) this one definitely did next to nothing for me.

The premise is simple: Molly Ringwald plays Andie, a high school senior who'll be graduating in a month. What sets her apart is the fact that she's poor and comes from a family of a lazy father and a mother who left them. Though she is poor, her home is typical middle class and her stylish clothing make her look a lot richer than she actually is, perhaps to hide the fact that she IS poor. Whatever. Her best friend Duckie is in love with her but doesn't want to ruin their friendship. Andie falls for a cute, but rich, guy at school (played by Andrew McCarthy). This new rich boy is envied and disliked by Duckie and is too much of a coward to stand up to his hoyty toyty rich best friend who doesn't wants to date Andie but is too much of a rich snob to snag her. He's mad so he tells his best friend to avoid her.

Anyways, the typical senior prom happens at the end where Duckie realizes he only wants for Andie's happiness and she ends up chasing her crush out and kissing him and the movie ends.

What's most annoying about this movie is the lameness of the characters. They just aren't very interesting. And when you think things are getting good, they do for a few minutes before the film drags along once again. This movie would've definitely been great if not for the complete lack of chemistry everyone involved had. Sure, there are tears and confusion, but you don't really care because these characters simply ACT OUT the script, you don't get the feeling at all that they're real people with real backgrounds. 99% of the time the ONLY interest they show in their lives is in their given situation. The ONLY time any character shows any type of human character is when Andie remakes her prom outfit because she's really into sewing and fashionable clothing. This doesn't add anything to the story except come in where it's handy. And even then it isn't handy cause the only reason she resewed her prom dress was cause her dad went out and bought one and said ""i know you may not like it, but i know you can do something with it."" she might as well have just gotten one herself she liked and that would've been the end of it.

Molly Ringwald, Hughes' muse for these movies, plays Andie Walsh, a smart hiugh schooler who lives with her deadbeat dad (the always wonderful Harry Dean Stanton) and is generally in the company of her friends, namely the carefree Duckie (Jon Cryer in a classic performance). Pining for Andy's affection is Blane McDonnagh, a rich and very popular student who wants to take Andie to the prom. This does not sit well with Duckie, who's harboured a secret crush on Andie since he's known her. Backstabbing, lies, and heartache ensues, but it leads up to a great conclusion.

He at least deserved some screen time dancing with his true love.

BUT- it's still a great movie, and the other extras are quite satisfying, such as the ""Favorite Scenes"" which includes Duckie's infectious dance to Try a Little Tenderness and the fight between Duckie and Steff (you have to love that shot of Duckie peering over the edge of the balcony down at Steff, staring him down with the look of death).

I was really disappointed to not hear from James Spader on the extras. He's always been my favorite jerk. ""You got a problem, friend?"" And those linen suits and penny loafers with no socks?! I just can't get enough of his smug, self-satisfied rich boy.

Also, hearing the cast talking about John Hughes' directing was interesting. You see how he got the most from his actors. And the more I watch this movie, the more I am convinced there has never been a stronger teenage actress than the likes of Molly Ringwald. Her pout, her passion, her fury- the quintessential redhead.

It has great interviews, and extra features the original DVD release did not contain, but don't buy it to see Duckie and Andie get together. The promised ""Alternate Ending"" is not included on the DVD. Many fans say that we should all be satisfied with the original fairy tale ending.  I loved that theater ending, where the girl gets her Prince Charming. It is a great finale.

However, although I agree that it is a fairy tale, one possible happy ending to this fairy tale would be that the underdog, the boy who loved Andie (Duckie) gets the girl. His utter devotion to her happiness is evident in the theatrical version, where her happiness is so much more important to him than his own that he sends her off to the boy she dreams of.  It should make no difference if the actress does not feel genuine chemistry (an argument repeated many times in the DVD interviews)--that's what acting is about: pretending that which is not real. Good acting can make it appear that there is chemistry. We underdog/outcast-types don't feel the theater ending should be thrown out, we just want a chance to see the other possibility, to see Duckie get his wish, and for Andie to realize she loves him too. It was a real disappointment to see this package promise that little snippet of the alternate fantasy, only to have the special features tell us incessantly why it was a bad idea instead.  I did genuinely enjoy seeing the actors discuss their experiences on the set, and laugh at the debate over which ending they thought made the best sense.

Pretty In Pink is the first one I've watched and if you can turn a blind eye to the fashion, then you'll realise that it's not actually that bad a film.

Andrew McCarthy plays Blaine, quite a rich guy, who falls for Molly's character, Andie, despite the protest of his also rich best friend. They get together, split up, and get back together at the prom, the staple of high school movies. Duckie (played by Jon Cryer) as a crush on Andie, and resents Blaine muscling in on ""his girl"".

FINALLY, I would get to see the ending that John Hughes intended- where Andie (Molly Ringwald) ends up with sweet, lovable Duckie (Jon Cryer) instead of smarmy, sappy richie ""major appliance"" Blane (Andrew McCarthy).

THE ORIGINAL ENDING IS NOT ON THIS DVD. That is a total rip-off. It says in plain English, on the list of features ""Original Ending"". Instead of showing it, they talk about it and why it didn't work.

It sounds like the real reason they changed the ending was that Molly Ringwald had the hots for Andrew McCarthy. And if the test audience booed, then they sure as hell didn't show it to a group of high school outcasts.

When the scene wasn't in the special feature, I even went so far as to watch the end of the movie thinking maybe they had actually put it in the feature. But no. For the one hundreth time, I had to watch Duckie make eyes at a rich girl with big boobs (Kristy Swanson, pre-Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and Andie make out with Sap-face in the parking lot.

First, I would like to say that Pretty in Pink is one of the best movies out of the Brat Pack opus.  It has it all, laughs, tears, good looking characters, and great music.  In sum, an all-around winner.

My answers to the following:

[Spoiler alert. Nothing overt, but I do touch on the ending indirectly.]

Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie:

Q. Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him?

A. Because anyone that clingy is a bit repulsive.

Q. Why does Ringwald's best friend disappear halfway through the movie?

A. She died after the movie was finished.  Iona takes over as the mother that Andie needs at this point.  Jena is a friend.  Andie needs a mom.

Q. Speaking of Spader, why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him?

A. All rich boys like to slum, every once and a while...  don't you watch movies?

Q. Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald's perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful?

A. Because in comparison to Blane and Steph's houses, it is pretty shabby.  Besides, her dad is unemployed, sits around in his underwear and is  pretty embarassing to a 16 year old girl.

Q. Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie?

A. Because in real life, any self-respecting girl in 1986 would have chosen Andrew McCarthy over Jon Cryer.

Q. Why, if the characters' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true, does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun?

A. Because it is a movie...

Q. Why, if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can?

Molly Ringwald gets asked out by the guy she has a crush on, and the 'trouble' is that he has money and she doesn't.

Molly Ringwald, Guilty Pleasure, 1980's Suburbia

""Pretty in Pink,"" along with ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Sixteen Candles"" are the three movies that made Molly Ringwald America's favorite prom date in the 1980's. Of the films associated with Ringwald (and the rest of the ""Brat Pack""), few are still enjoying any regular circulation now. What is sad is how most of the people who starred in these films and once enjoyed A-List status have fallen beneath the mainstream horizon. The interesting thing is the way these films portray an idealized, bittersweet suburban-princess ghetto that never existed but has become part of American mythology that still draws young people like moths to a flame. The films mentioned at the top of this review, along with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" could comprise a modern day ""golden age"" legend for exurban teens. ""Pretty in Pink"" was probably the most financially successful of Molly's follies (it wasn't the best or the funniest, that was ""Sixteen Candles"") and probably stands as a central monument for that last gasp of films that could unapologetically be about nothing at all and still make for good entertainment. These movies were not made for anyone over 20-except as guilty pleasures-and should not be measured or criticized as any more than the fluff they were intended to be...but what's wrong with guilty pleasure?",1140134400,2,1531,5.043478260869565

Despite, the fact that Andrew's character's friends don't like MOlly Ringwald's character because she's from the ""other side of the tracks"" they decide to throw caution to wind and date each other.

Molly Ringwald plays an outcast and dates the popular, rich kid, named Andy (Andrew McCarthy).

The plot is easy to follow and entertaining.

It's definitely a good movie; especially, if you love 80's music. The music in the film is great as are the characters.

An interesting character played by Annie Potts is Molly Ringwald's older friend, who acts as her female confidante and offers Molly advice on dating.

The 3rd in 3 years, thus completing the 80's teen trilogy (""16 Candles"" in 1984, and ""The Breakfast Club"" in 1985). ""Pretty In Pink"" succeeds in several areas (Ringwald and Cryer are great together), but fails in comparison to the other 2 movies mentioned above. ""16 Candles"" was filled with bust-a-gut laughs with extremely memorable lines and characters (Long Duck Dong made this movie). ""The Breakfast Club"" was also filled with humor, but delt with several serious universal issues that teens deal with at the high school level (at school as well as at home). ""Pink"" deals with clashes between classes... a poor girl likes a rich guy and what happens along the way is what this movie is about. Not that there's anything wrong with that... but ""Pink"" just isn't in the same league as it's 2 predecessors. Molly Ringwald is basically the same kid you've seen before... just a tad more sad and depressed about who she is and the poor hand she's been delt in life. Jon Cryer's character (Duckie) is off the wall funny and just looking for acceptance by Ringwald (Andie) throughout the entire movie. Andrew McCarthy is the other co-star as the rich kid (Blain) daring to go across the tracks to tangle with Andie. The DVD has the restored movie - but, NO bonus features. That's a negative in my book. Commentaries, gag reels, deleted scenes, behind the scenes, even a short interview with the stars years later would have been cool.

This time Molly plays a charactor named Andy (why Andy?). Anyway she is from the poor side of the tracks and while she does well in school, she also cares for her heart broken father.

Andy does not trust ""Richies"", meaning kids with money, or actually kids with rich parents. But she meets a Richie played by Andrew McCarthy and well, love takes root. However 'Duckie' steals the movie away from Molly. He's an oddball type who marches to his own drummer. He loves Andy but can't tell her because he is too afraid. His charactor was perfectly parodied in 'Not Another Teen Movie'.

Look for an early Andrew DICE Clay who plays the doorman/bouncer at the nightclub CATS. Also Annie Potts looks pretty hot as Molly's friend.

This is an extremely barebones DVD. No commentary, no deleted/alternate scenes, not even a trailer. You get 'PLAY', 'SETUP', and 'SCENE SELECTION'. That's it.

He was dynamic as always with super cool facial expressions and great one liners like, ""You need to love yourself before I love yourself"". I could write 90 pages on how awesome McCarthy is, but let me simplify this thing. The original story had Ringdog ending up with Dorkie(or whatever the nerd's name is), but the movie producers understood that if a cool popular guy with money wants a girl, he gets that girl. I don't know why that is so hard for people to understand. I'm loaded and drop your groceries hot and if I want to go out with a girl, she goes out with me.

Pretty In Pink, while it might have been Molly Ringwald's crowning achievement tied with Sixteen Candles, lives on in teen movie folklore and John Hughes's impressive resume, was anticlimatic.  The heroine doesn't end up with the lovable friend who had loved her from afar for years, but ends up with the rich guy.  Lucky for her the rich guy cares for her.  Rumor had it that the test audiences wanted her to end up with the rich guy and not the lovable Duckie.  *Sigh*  Well, the screwballs spoke and the producers listened.  We have Pretty In Pink still, but the ending brought it all down the drain.  So much for giving the people what they want.

That was how I felt years ago.  Oh to be so young and foolish again!  I hadn't known love yet, and I hadn't known the pain of unrequited love as I do now.

If anything I've been very lucky, I've learned more about love than most people twice my age, if I can be so bold.  I identified the most with Duckie here, because just because you love someone doesn't mean that you are going to live happily ever after.

But, I just couldn't resist adding this to my Listmania list of ""my favorite movies""!!!

I experienced my ""teen years"" during the mid 1980's, so of course I saw EVERY ONE of the Molly Ringwald movies when they came out - and I LOVED every single one!!!

I often wonder what ever became of her - as she had quite a string of hit movies, and then just disappeared from the radar.  I honestly hope to see her again some day, as I always thought she was a really good actress...

Anyway, ""Pretty in Pink"" is about a teenage girl living during the 1980's (you can tell by the ""great"" style of clothes) on the ""wrong side of the tracks"".  She lived with her father, who simply did not like to work, as her mother had left them some years earlier.

She spends most of her time with her best friend ""Ducky"" - who's a really great guy, also from a ""working class"" family.  However, there are 2 REALLY rich, good looking guys who seem to be interested in her.  1 of them is a MAJOR jerk, and all he ever cares about is ""one thing"" (I'm sure you know what I mean), so she consistently turns him down - which makes him EXTREMELY ""pissed off"".  The 2nd guy seems to be a pretty nice guy, and she becomes enamored of him.

Well, the ""nice guy"" finally asks her out & she says yes - only to be treated like trash by his friends.  But, they try to continue dating & he eventually asks her to the prom - & she says yes.

Will he show up?  Will she be forced to go alone?  Who will she end up with - Ducky or the rich guy???  I don't want to ruin it for you in case you never saw the movie, but suffice it to say that you will ALWAYS remember the ending to this movie!!! (I don't know of anyone who doesn't, and many of them last saw it about 20 years ago!!!).

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage romance movies in general, or the Molly Ringwald gang in particular.

Steph gives him a hard time because she rejected him and went for his best friend. Wouldn't you be upset? And at the end, blane said to steph, she thinks your sh*t and deep down you know she's right.

Andie lives with her father Jack Walsh (Harry Dean Stanton) who is an unemployed alcoholic. Like I said before, Andie is an outcast in her school.

The '80s music fit perfectly with the film. James Spader and Jon Cryer really stole the show here. I especially loved James Spader's smarminess as he tries to sabotage the budding relationship between Andie and Blane.

What is it that we have lost?  In my opinion, in the films of today, we have lost a sense of innocence, we are no longer upbeat and it seems to me that many of the films pandered to teenagers and young twentysomethings are filled to the brim with cynicism and leave a sour taste in your mouth, once you have left the movie theatre.  I find myself saying, ""Did I really pay $7.50 for this?!""

What makes ""Pretty in Pink"" so good is the great cast.  This is truly Molly Ringwald at her finest, cast as a high school senior from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" who is pursuing a romance with a classmate with seemingly all of the breaks (Andrew McCarthy).  Her best friend, ""Ducky,"" is masterfully played by Jon Cryer.  Ducky, of course, is interested in her on more than just a friend level, and feels threatened when this new guy with money and popularity comes around to woo his best friend.  Ducky has a combination of unusual fashion sense (where did he get those shoes?!), he's got that wonderful combination of gawky teenage vulnerability and stand-up comedy timing to match.  The strong cast, along with a great 80s soundtrack that will take you back, great direction and a great plot that challenges us to think about whether your class standing truly determines who you can love in the end makes the film both entertaining and intelligent.  This film should be a pre-requisite for young filmmakers and 1980s film buffs alike.",1102118400,15,1602,4.566433566433567
278846,5,6300214710,"This movie is one of the best for 1980's fans:

1.  The soundtrack is outstanding, featuring several huge hits from that great decade!

2.  Molly Ringwald is superb.  She does a great job portraying the intelligent girl who has one problem, she is from the wrong side of the tracks!  Jon Cryer is great as the wacky best friend ""Ducky"" who has a secret love interest in Molly.  Great performances by Andrew McCarthy (as her love interest) and James Spader who plays McCarthys evil best friend (a role he would often play in the 1980's).

3.  It is a somewhat of a 1980's version of Cinderella.  I enjoyed how it showed there is good in everyone(except maybe Spader).  Except for a few words and a couple of suggestive scenes, this is a great movie for all ages...a timeless piece of history form my youth (class of 1984!).",1097712000,5,822,4.523809523809524
278847,2,6300214710,"Pretty in Pink is truly one of the worst bratpack movies ever made.  Whiny Molly Ringwald has by this time thoroughly worn out her welcome; her perpetual pout, her eye-rolling and her generally sour disposition are extremely grating, all the moreso because she is in virtually every scene!  The only interesting thing about Ringwald's ""performance"" is her ever-changing haircolor (throughout the movie, her hair goes from strawberry blonde to dark auburn to nearly chartreuse back to strawberry blonde, and so on.  At least SOMETHING changed; her expression never did!).
Andrew McCarthy is the wimpiest ""romantic hero"" ever, and, like Molly, his expression never changes.  ""Must remain bland"" was surely his mantra throughout filming.
Jon Cryer plays ""Ducky"" (did YOU go to high school with anybody who had a nickname like that???) like a spastic goofball.  James Spader is wasted in a one-note role as ""The Mean Snobby Guy.""  There's no end to the talent wasted in this film: Annie Potts and Harry Dean Stanton are also squandered in thankless, my-character-only-exists-to-showcase-Molly-Ringwald roles.
As if all that's not annoying enough, Molly's character is the richest ""poor girl"" ever, with her own lilac-colored Kharman Ghia, an endless supply of funky vintage dresses, petticoats, sweaters, granny boots, and hats (if you think she picked all that swag up at Salvation Army, you're crazy), and her own phone complete with answering machine (no big deal now, but it was in the '80s).
The cherry on top is the fact that the dress Molly cobbles together and ""triumphantly"" wears to Prom is ugly.  Ugly, ugly, UGLY.  That's not just my opinion, either: I saw this dog in the theater, and people LAUGHED when she made her entrance.
Bottom line: if you're in the mood for a bratpack movie, watch 16 Candles or Breakfast Club, instead.",1089158400,9,1838,5.1237458193979935

278849,3,6300214710,"I liked the main character, Andie (Molly Ringwald) a lot & I was rooting for her throughout the entire film . Maybe it's because she reminded me a lot of myself when I was in high school. She has her own unique style, which she gets flack for by the popular girls. ""Where'd you get that - the 5 & dime store?"" the snooty Benny asks her. And that hellish scene in gym class made my stomach churn as I recalled my own teen angst ridden days in gym class. One of Andie's best friends, Jenna (Alexa Kenin, who, sadly, died shortly after the film was released) brings humor to the awful situation by flicking Benny off & saying she hopes her breasts shrivel up and fall off. It's one of the many hilarious & memorable scenes of the film.
Ringwald is backed up by a strong supporting cast, including Jon Cryer, who plays her best guy friend, Duckie, who is just side-splittingly funny. In one of the funniest scenes of the film, he gets thrown in the girls bathroom by a group of nauseatingly preppy guys for trying to defend himself. ""Wait a minute. We don't got none of this stuff in the boys room. You got doors on the stalls & a candy machine (He points to the tampon dispenser).
Harry Dean Stanton has never been more adorable & endearing as Andie's father. Annie Potts is wonderful as Andie's eccentric mother figure & co-worker. James Spader is Steff, the totally creepy slimeball & best friend of Blaine (Andrew McCarthy). I dismiss the fact that he looked way too old to be in high school because he just plays the part so damn well. He hates Andie & makes fun of her in front of his crowd. Secretly though, he has had a crush on her for years & it kills him that she won't give him the time of day. Ugh, I remember creeps like that in high school.
What I like is that all of the characters we're cheering for change for the better. Iona stops dating losers & gets herself a classy new image. Andie's father starts to get out of his rut that he's been in since Andie's mother left them years before & looks for a job for real this time. Duckie learns to stop making unfair generalizations about the popular people once he finds out Blaine is actually a very nice guy. Blaine learns to do what he wants to do & tells Steff off & makes things right with Andie. Andie refuses to let the popular kids break her. The only thing I didn't like was the unresolved ending that doesn't really leave things on a completely positive, realistic note. Andie & Blaine still have his parents to deal with & if they're as awful as Steff desribed, Blaine just might encounter the two unpleasant words that can pop up in difficult families: disown & estrangement.

Molly Ringwald, always a pleasure, is at her absolute best in this film.  I'm not normally a fan of Andrew McCarthy, but he's perfect in this film as the dreamy rich boy.

278895,2,6300214710,"A typical John Hughes 80s flick, Pretty in Pink has the misfortune of including both Andrew McCarthy and Molly Ringwald as lead characters.  As anybody who has seen either Mannequin, Less Than Zero, or St. Elmo's Fire can attest to, Mr. McCarthy is always suffering from the presence of superior actors(James Spader x 3, and Rob Lowe, of all people).  Ms Ringwald works well if she has a better romantic lead, but she cannot carry the load in this film.  The rich/poor love connection could best be described as a cliche of a cliche, and Mr. McCarthy's character appears to have no more charm than a blue shirt and a sport coat can muster, thus foiling the audience's attempt to believe that Ms. Ringwald would fall for the ""richie.""
The one bright spot in the film was the too-small role of James Spader as a golden boy with a nasty edge.  Personally, I would have liked to see him trample Mr. McCarthy for being so damn boring rather than be apalled at the unlikely love intetrest he has developed.

I really, really want to give this 5 stars, but can't bring myself to do it. The plot is just too off for me. The whole rich/poor thing is an odd premise, and he asks her to prom after one date? Plus, the predictability of it all is so sickening. And Duckie... my poor poor Duckie.
The acting in this movie is great for the most part. The supporting cast especially. Jon Cryer and Annie Potts made this movie. And if only James Spader didn't look 30, I would say he was perfectly cast as well. Ringwald and McCarthy did alright with their parts, not great, but not badly either.

She works at a small, but hip record store with her quirky, but older friend Iona (Annie Potts) and pals around with Duckie (Jon Cryer), her best friend who secretly loves her.  Andrew McCarthy is Blane the rich and popular boy who falls for Andie despite his friends, including the lecherous Steff (James Spader), balking at him for going out with poor white trash.  The film has a fairly formualmatic plot, but it is elevated above the simple story by wonderful performances by the three leads.  Ms. Ringwald is supremely sweet and you feel for her in her tough situation.  Mr. McCarthy is amiable as a someone caught between his feelings and friends and Mr. Cryer adds the perfect amount of comedy relief to his character.  Mr. Spader is also quite good in his role, but he seems too old to be a teenager and is just a little out of place.  The soundtrack to the film is first rate and the album peaked at number five on the charts.  This was the last big hit for Ms. Ringwald and the film marked her end as the teen queen of films.

0 stars for Paramount's DVD version of this movie. Like virtually all of Paramount's backtitles (just check out their release in September of ""My Bloody Valentine,"" ""The Tenant"" or ""Don't Look Now"", they put NO SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS or EXTRAS on this DVD! What a monumental 'missing of the boat.' And what an insult to fans of this movie and DVD consumers!
Clearly, Paramount doesn't have respect for its own backtitles, preferring instead to put extras mostly on new movies released on DVD. What a shame. ""Pretty in Pink"" is 16 years old.

I really don't think I need to review the content of the movie- if you are reading this you have probably seen it!  I'm thrilled that Paramount has finally put this out on DVD.  But... and there is a BIG ""but""....
There are no extra goodies on this DVD.  The original ending (Molly Ringwald ends up with Duckie) is not here.  (Check it out: Andrew McCarthy looks COMPLETELY different in the last seen. His hair is longer, his skin is whiter, and he looks about 10 years older, even though the ending was filmed only several months after the principle shooting ended!)  That is a total missed opportunity that legions of Molly Ringwald/Brat Pack/John Hughes/80's teen flick fans have been waiting to see for years!  There's not even a theatrical trailer on this DVD!  I can understand that deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer- these things can get lost in the vaults over the years. But you simply cannot tell me that they couldn't dig up the video for OMD's ""If You Leave"" to put on here!
Some commentary would have been great as well!  There are all sorts of things that the director could have discussed: OMD originally did a song for ""Pretty In Pink"" called ""Goddess Of Love"".  When the ending of the movie changed, they recorded a new song (""If You Leave"")... ""Goddess Of Love"" ended up going on their ""Pacific Age"" album.  More trivia: Molly's favorite group at the time, The Rave-Up's, perform in the movie. (Their song wasn't on the soundtrack.)  Molly carries a notebook in ""Sixteen Candles"" that has ""The Rave-Up's"" handwritten across it.
Watch out for an early performance by Gina Gershon!  She barely has any lines- I think she's in about two scenes.  You won't miss those lips of hers.  Also look for Dweezil Zappa (as ""Simon"").  Annie Potts practically steals the show in this pre-""Designing Women"" performance.  Not to be missed!

Who is taking whom, what will they wear, who loves whom, and who is whose true friend. This is about a group of teenagers, specifically one girl and her attempts to cop off with a rich boy. The insight into the American 'class system' will enlighten British viewers as there are closer comparisons with our own class system than might at first be obvious, although the American system seems to be based on money rather than anything else. Having said that, the 'can love exist between people from such different backgrounds' plot was hackneyed after Shakespeare did it with Romeo And Juliet, so by the time we get to 1984 we don't really care whether she gets him or the other guy. This is entertaining, yet examines the relationships of young-adulthood with a subtle intelligence. The sets, costumes, and music are very clever in that they evoke the 1950s whereas they firmly pinpoint the movie in the 1980s.

Andrew McCarthy, though of greater acting capability than he displays  here, still plays his rich but insecure Romeo (Blane) to a T, and is cute enough to make any teenage girl fall in love with him-despite the wierd eye thing.

One day, however, magically, a very rich and very popular Blain (Andrew McCarthy) notices her and starts to pursue her. Naturally his friends make fun of him (particularly a very slimy James Spader) but he tries to ignore them. Eventually though he starts thinking of his reputation more than of her. She is heartbroken, but by the end of the film, at the prom, they hook back up again. And the rest is history.

278931,2,6300214710,"[Spoiler alert.  Nothing overt, but I do touch on the ending indirectly.]
Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie:
Q. Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him?
A. So that the audience can identify with her, even though it turns out they're best friends.
Q. Why does Ringwald's best friend disappear halfway through the movie?
A. Because the actress died.  But that's no reason to keep the scenes she shot, with no explanation of the character's disappearance, and then scribble new material for Annie Potts' record shop supervisor as the new best friend in the second half of the movie.
Q. Why does Spader look like he belongs in college, not high school?
A. Because he was clearly too old for the part, although he was otherwise perfect.
Q. Speaking of Spader, why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him?
A. Plot point Hughes thought he had to have, but it's actually unnecessary.
Q. Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald's perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful?
A. Because audiences would presumably be repulsed by genuine poverty.  (It's also a mystery why she's so ashamed of it if she rejects the values of her snobby classmates so vehemently.)
Q. Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie?
A. Because the writer of the novelization knew what the only real logical ending was.  Hughes mistook gloss over substance again, as he did in ""The Breakfast Club,"" where Ally Sheedy's transformation from quirky indivualist to Barbie doll was supposed to be a good thing.
Q. Why, if the characters' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true, does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun?
A. Because cheap, easy laughs are excused by audiences raised on sitcoms and music videos.
Q. Why, if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can?
A. Don't ask me.
Q. Why is the father played by Stanton such a weakling?
A. It's required in any movie from the late 70s on where a child or teenager is the protagonist.  Has there been a parental figure in movies in the last 25 years as charming and authoritative as Ferris Bueller?
Q. Why would anyone hire an actor whose idea of emoting is to press his lips together and bulge his eyes out?
A. Ask Andrew McCarthy's agent.
Can I recommend anything about this movie?  Yes.  Cryer is genuinely appealing in his best role.  The soundtrack still kicks.  And the climax (moments before the ending itself falls apart, when you think the right thing is about to happen, before it doesn't) is genuinely touching, because Duckie deserves happiness and Andy deserves Duckie.",978566400,75,2749,4.722338204592902
278932,5,6300214710,"John Hughes wrote this story about Andie (Molly Ringwald), the girl from the wrong side of the tracks who has two admires - her best friend, and a  rich guy. She does not exactly fit in with the guy of her dreams or his  popular, rich crowd. And the guy who admires her most, her best friend  who's in the same clique as she, is not the one she wants. Her father  cannot find a job and is still holding onto the memory of her mother, who  left when she was fourteen. Life seems horrible, and she is deeply  confused. She wants the guy she likes, but she doesn't want to loose her  best friend in the process. The fact that she is being harassed by the  popular girls because she is not rich enough makes life worse. But soon she  comes to realize that everything works itself out in time.",966988800,,788,4.1655629139072845
278933,4,6300214710,"Being a guy who was a teen during the 80's, I just love this movie. One of the best coming of age movies ever made. At one time we all were cast in the ""social ladder"" and watching this movies brings back a lot of  memories of the awkwardness of being a regular teen. I have always liked  Molly Ringwald. As a teen I had a crush on her,(didnt all us guys?).She  rules in this movie!",954460800,,382,4.0
278934,5,6300214710,"In my mind, Pretty In Pink is the quintessential 80's movie! I remember seeing it in the theatre when I was 11, and I was hooked immediately. The acting is realistic (Molly Ringwald plays one of the best ""beautiful  outcast""s I've ever seen, and Jon Cryer...well, he's gorgeously  lovelorn), and the screenwriting and directing are top-notch. This is one  of John Hughes' best films! If you love his other movies, you will  positively DIE for this one....
After 15 years, Pretty In Pink still  makes me swoon as much as it did when I was a kid. Funny and poignant from  beginning to end.",953164800,4,587,4.596153846153846

It was ridiculous.
Molly Ringwald belonged with the Ducky guy.
