8575705,4,B00BYS0XE0,"I'm glad that I ordered this dvd.  It was very funny!!!!  Tommy Davidson is a fool....  All of the skits were very funny and clever, NOT ""TOO VULGAR""; but it is meant for grown-ups to watch, NOT KIDS!  The comedy lineup was also good.  Deon Cole was the funniest, and he connected with the audience the best....  All in all, this was a good purchase.",1405814400,,350,4.3076923076923075
