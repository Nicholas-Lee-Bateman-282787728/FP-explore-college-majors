8136846,3,B000H5U6F2,"Inexpensive multi-DVD sets of older films are likely to be dire in terms of quality, with bad picture and worse sound--but this set of three DVDs and eleven films is something of a surprise.  No, the picture and sound are not perfect, but they fall in the range of ""as good as it gets short of a full digital restoration and clean up.""  In that sense, INCREDIBLE MONSTERS is a pleasant surprise.  On the other hand, the films may not be.

Although the earliest film in the set is from 1934 and the latest is from 1976, the majority of the titles are 1950s and 1960s flicks, most of them in black and white and most of them best described as drive-in trash.  On the plus side, the film includes a handful of interesting, entertaining, and fun films.  SHE DEMONS (1958), MONSTER MAKER (1944), and ATTACK OF THE GIANT LEECHES (1959) fall into this category, and the set also offers the seldom seen English SECRET OF THE LOCH (1934), which is really more of a comedy than a horror film.  Even so, I would not rate any of these four films at more than three stars, and I must note that MONSTER MAKER and SECRET OF THE LOCH are really most interesting as comparison points against what major studios were doing at the same times.

As for the rest of the films--the words that come to mind are dire, silly, and uninteresting, unentertaining, and a complete waste of time.  The 1966 MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE is often cited as the worst ""B"" horror film ever made, but both THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS, THE SNOW CREATURE, FRIGHT NIGHT, and TRACK OF THE MOON BEAST give it a run for that title--and THE BEAST FROM HAUNTED CAVE, SHE BEAST, and the utterly ridiculous JESSIE JAMES MEETS FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER aren't terribly far behind.

Quite a few people enjoy ""B"" horror films of the 1950s and 1960s, myself among them, but the vast majority of these films aren't really ""B.""  Nor are they ""C,"" ""D,"" ""E""... well, you get the idea.  Even so, the better films make this collection worth the inexpensive price.

8136847,3,B000H5U6F2,"ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, liner notes appear on box's back cover.

No vintage monster movie collection would be complete without Roger Corman. INCREDIBLE MONSTERS contains two movies he oversaw as producer. ""Attack of the Giant Leeches"" has its share of bloopers, humor (both intentional and otherwise) and 10 cent production values-- everything a Roger C. fan could want. ""Beast from Haunted Cave"" was filmed in sub-freezing temperatures. Corman appears here as a skiing extra, even though he could barely ski. The ""beast"" is a hairy blood-sucking spider/Sasquatch that we see only in the film's last 10 minutes.

""The Snow Creature"" is a captured Himalayan Yeti that escapes and runs rampant in L.A. ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" stars wrestler and Ed Wood veteran Tor Johnson as the post-bomb mutant. This one's practically a silent movie with narration. The most popular title in this set is the self-explanatory ""Secret of the Loch."" ""Nessie"" is portrayed here by a lizard.
