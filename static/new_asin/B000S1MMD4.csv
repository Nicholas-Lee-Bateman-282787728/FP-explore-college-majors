2879022,2,B000S1MMD4,"""Pittsburgh"" has its moments (the initial audition scene with Jeff Goldblum, a few others).  The problem is, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean raised the bar so high on artistic mockumentaries (""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Spinal Tap"", ""A Mighty Wind"") that one is too often aware of what's missing in this effort, namely a sense of true absurdity bubbling underneath the faux seriousness of it all.  The concept is good, but not enough genuinely funny moments to make ""Pittsburgh"" something I'd recommend.",1192579200,,504,5.2875
2879023,1,B000S1MMD4,"Finally, being famous for being famous has jumped the shark. Some amusing moments, but really now, didn't this stuff die with Anna-Nicole Smith? Why not just get a season compendiums of the Larry Sanders Show?

2879024,4,B000S1MMD4,"I initially watched this movie primarily because I live in Pittsburgh and like Jeff Goldblum.  But - even if you aren't from Pittsburgh and only moderately like Jeff Goldblum, this film is worth a watch and I would highly recommend it.

The film reminded me of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" where the central character (in this case, Goldblum) is the vortex with a cast of eccentric characters swirling around him.

Probably most funny are the scenes with Illeana Douglas and new beau Moby and Goldblum, who's trying really, really hard to like Moby, despite some of the stuff Moby is saying - and watching.  There's also scene set in a parade with Douglas and Moby that is also very funny.

Watching Goldblum's mother and stepfather, you'll see the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Jeff's mom is a pip, 80 years young with a 57-year old husband (and - they've been married for 20 years!), who also has a not-so-secret crush on Illeana Douglas.

Also hysterical are Goldblum's exchanges with his agent/manager, whose voice mails to Goldblum become more and more frantic as Goldblum remains resolute in his decision to ditch Hollywood for the lead role of Harold Hill in the Music Man - giving up a multi-million dollar deal and the coveted first guest slot on Conan O'Brien.

Goldblum cast old friends, and you can see the affection and love he has for Douglas as well as Ed Begley Jr., who ropes Goldblum into becoming a reluctant spokesperson for what you guess is another one of Begley's get-rich-quick gadgets.

The quick glimpses you get of Pittsburgh are good - most exterior shots are on one of the famous sister bridges downtown and on streets downtown.

While the film is built around the premise of Goldblum doing Music Man as a way to be with his fiancee and prevent her from getting booted out of the US (she's Canadian and is here on a work visa), you see surprisingly little of her on screen.  So while Goldblum talks and talks to his friends about how in love he is with Catherine, one sees only a short glimpse of that relationship.

Nevertheless, it is funny and smart and I would recommend it to anyone who likes smart, quirky comedies.",1188432000,49,2153,4.666666666666667
2879025,1,B000S1MMD4,"I'm Jeff Goldblum, I have a hot young girl friend, and I'm famous.

I used to like Goldblum Then it seemed like he was veering off from being dry and funny to just smug. This is the movie that marks the dividing line for me. I don't know if the girl friend in the movie is his real life girl friend. It wouldn't surprise me. She is really cute and men have done dumber things than make a movie this bad in order to get laid.

The movie is about Goldblum agreeing to star in a local musical even though he can't sing so his hot very young girl friend can also get a part. The premise could have been a funny mockumantary. That's what they were going for: something like Best in Show or Waiting for Gufman.

But the thing those movies have going for them is even though they make fun of everyone involved they still show us the underlying humanity. We may laugh at the weird couple that wins best in show (slutty wife with nebish husband) but we also kind of like them and root for them. There was no one to like in this movie. The people behave in a completely unrealistic way and Goldblum really phones in his performance.  Everyone in the movie seems to be so in awe of Jeff Goldblum for some reason.  I was totally bored with this movie and only saw it through to the end so that my girl friend and I could make sarcastic comments as it was playing. For a while I was hoping there might be some plot twist, like the hot young girl friend meets another celebrity or something... But no, it just goes on to a very boring predictable unfunny conclusion.",1266624000,6,1552,4.212121212121212
2879026,5,B000S1MMD4,"My husband and I both have done regional theater with celebrities who are out of their element.  The only difference with this movie is Jeff Goldblum KNOWS it.  From an audition scenario to talking with his manager (somewhat reminds me of Sidney Pollack in Tootsie)to a rehearsal situation where the director is less than complimentary, it is hysterical.  I was on the floor laughing from the moment it started to the end.  Don't miss it and shame on anyone that didn't distribute it.",1251158400,,484,4.795180722891566

2879028,4,B000S1MMD4,"Pittsburgh is a movie you don't expect it to be; a mockumentary about a real occurrence, with some great acting by Jeff Goldblum, Ed Begley and Illeanna Douglas. I would definitely call this movie ""quirky,"" because there is so much unique delight in the storytelling and the production value, that you can't help but sit enthralled by it all. Some of the funniest stuff is between Goldblum and his agent who plays himself in the movie. While certainly not the same as Christopher Guest's brand of mockumentary, ""Pittsburgh"" is Groucho to Guest's Harpo.",1224028800,2,552,4.946236559139785
2879029,5,B000S1MMD4,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that shows the deep humanity of Jeff Goldblum and how he is such a genuine human being, going through the difficulties of a commitment he made for love. You see him facing incredible odds as he tries to make his role in ""The Music Man"" workable. You can see his fear that he may be in the process of damaging his career.

  Nothing could be further from the truth. In my mind, this movie cements Jeff Goldblum as someone whose entire career and very essence I admire. He's just a good guy. Not a negative could be said about him and I would even show that some of the stereotypes of him from the past were turned on their heads in this appearance. I watched this movie right through to the end and though I was elated with his triumph, I didn't want it to end.

  One final note: when I heard Jeff say he had been thinking of retiring from acting, I felt a huge sense of alarm. Please, Mr. Goldblum. You're only 51. You look fantastic. Please keep working. You are a Movie Star.",1204329600,,1015,4.260416666666667
2879030,4,B000S1MMD4,"The highlights of every Summer Season in Pittsburgh,Pa.are the two week runs of The Pittsburgh Light Opera Company's productions of various famous musicals.

This film is one big stitch,and Jeff Goldblum is so infectious and adorably innocent that I smiled from ear to ear for all 90 minutes of this semi-spoof of an actor returning to his ""humble origins.""( I have been up to Pittsburgh for these productions and they are good regional shows that act as ""Summer Stock"" for named actors!...and the theater is bigger than 99% of NYC ""houses!"") This film is not like the Christopher Guest mockumentaries. It stands on it's own as an hilarious look at the fear that a great one experiences when he has to act in front of his home town. July 13th becomes ""Jeff Goldblum Day."" Goldblum is amazing in this film!

I met Mr. Goldblum when he was acting in ""The Pillowman"" on Broadway in 2005. He is a marvelous stage presence and has numerous Broadway stints to his credit. Unfortunately,people that only know him from film think that stage acting is beyond his ken. THIS is what ""Pittsburgh"" spoofs. Goldblum taps and twizzles his way to the last row of The Benendum and the audience goes wild. The ""Hometown Boy"" has come home!4 and 1/2 stars!",1202428800,2,2566,6.541176470588235
2879031,1,B000S1MMD4,"I saw this at a film fesival where they screened the movie for free.  Half way through people began walking out due to boredom.  By the time the movie was done, maybe one quarter of the original audience was still there.",1201564800,2,220,4.341463414634147
2879032,4,B000S1MMD4,"I thought Pittsburgh was enjoyable and had plenty of laughable moments.  The reactions of people to Goldblum's decision to actually audition for the lead part in a regional play are really funny.  His agent acts as if Goldblum is committing career suicide, and the Director's comments to Goldblum are not what you would expect.  But it is all for love.

The interactions with Ed Begley and Illeana Douglas, along with Moby, are also funny.

I don't know how much of this is real v. make-believe, but it is funny.  The film is short and you see it as a fly on the wall, so you should not expect more than what it is.",1194652800,,615,4.398230088495575
2879033,5,B000S1MMD4,"Being a Pittsburgh native, I honestly loved this movie and wanted to add my rating to the mix so that it wouldn't be unfairly dragged down.

You just can't compare it to other mockumentaries... (Besides, the story is full of half truths, which makes it intriguing to try to figure out what was real and what was not.) You have to appreciate it in its own right.

Sure, the premise is simple -- you know the whole story from the preview. But the familiar sights and sounds of Pittsburgh, the quirky soundtrack, the just-a-little-beyond-home-movie aura, and the hilarious incongruity of our favorite philosophical scientist singing and dancing to ""The Music Man"" made this movie surprisingly amusing and endearing. It was this incongruity I think that really made it fun to watch and kept us engaged the whole movie through.

If you've seen all the blockbusters and are just looking for a movie to unwind to, do give Pittsburgh a chance.",1194652800,,935,4.83125

8204007,2,B000S1MMD4,"Mockumentaries  with the exception of Best of Show  aren't usually my style. So I wasn't exactly thrilled when my editors sent along Pittsburgh. But I really like Jeff Goldblum  I even watched the no-hit wonder Raines because he was the star (Thank goodness that didn't last long!). After a sluggish beginning, Pittsburgh offered up a few funny scenes and backhanded chuckles at love and the Hollywood ego  but it didn't have that element of ""great.""

Actor Jeff Goldblum is in love. After only a few weeks of intense dating the twice-divorced actor gets engaged to Catherine Wreford, a dancer from Manitoba, Canada. Thing is, Catherine doesnt have a green card, and Goldblums friends believe she is using him to get citizenship. So Goldblum accepts a compromise: Get Catherine a job as a dancer in the small-time production of The Music Man in his hometown of Pittsburgh. Of course, Goldblum has to be part of the production. His agent is furious. The production is beneath the actors career and Agentman would rather Goldblum take a $4 million role in a new Michael Bay film  which has a production schedule that coincides with rehearsals for the play.

Goldblum ignores his agents repeated telephone calls  and discovers the damage he does to his career (and ego) as he opts out of incredible opportunities for love. (Goldblum was engaged to Wreford last year, but IMDB reports that the two are no longer dating. Ah, the long-lasting Tinsel Town relationship, which got the unknown dancer a foot in films) Hes totally dissed by the director, and Goldblum tests the waters with his fianc&eacute; to see if he can wriggle out of his commitment, which causes a bit of tension between the two. He enlists the help of friends Illeana Douglas (LUV her), and Ed Bagley, Jr. to flesh out the plays cast. Douglas is dating a sex-obsessed Moby, who dumps her in the middle of rehearsals and Bagley, Jr. is trying to get Goldblum to do a quid-pro-quo by offering up his name and image for a solar-powered panel scheme, er, business venture.

Pittsburghs not bad  its not great, either. If the actors had been B-grade, it would have been a nightmare, but Goldblum, Douglas and B.J. offer up some funny moments. Still, the first 34 minutes weren't so hot. I finally put in a load of laundry and microwaved some food to get through it. Afterward, there were a few scenes with Moby, the plays director and Conan O-Brien that showed off Goldblums knack of saying so much with just a look (which seemed to be saying What the hell have I gotten myself into? No turning back now). It wasn't enough to make the 84-minute film worth my while  even with one of my favorite actors.

If you like movies like Best of Show, you may want to give Pittsburgh a shot  but I won't make any guarantees. I really liked Show, and though Pittsburgh had its moments, it just didn't seem to have that element of staying power and hilarity I was hoping for.",1423267200,,2922,4.68359375
8204008,5,B000S1MMD4,This DVD of Jeff Goldblum was really good!  Especially since my son is in it!  Jeff Goldblum has a Music Man doll I made in his likeness!

I live in Pittsburgh, and it made it look so bland, stuffy and boring; though it is about Pittsburgh theater, and that is pretty bland and pretentious. The film is as flat as a pancake.. I like Jeff Goldblum, but this one is pretty bad. It's supposed to be a mockumentary, but to even compare it to such classics like Best in Show and Waiting for Guffman is a horrible insult. It's also nothing like Curb Your Enthusiasm, because there's no punch lines or reveals.. There's no dry humor in this, it's just dry and pointless, and it never should have been made for the public.. That said, I still like Jeff Goldblum and Pittsburgh .. the city, not this movie..",1402099200,,777,4.597122302158273
8204011,1,B000S1MMD4,"Back in 2004, Jeff Goldblum starred in the Pittsburgh Light Opera production of The Music Man, featuring his now-former girlfriend, Catherine Wreford, plus Illeana Douglas, and Ed Begley, Jr.  Although Mr. Goldblum is a talented actor, his skills do not extend to musical comedy. That became the basis for this unfunny mockumentry with all of the aforementioned playing versions of themselves.  It's hard to see why this was made other than as a vanity project for  Ms. Wreford.  As someone else pointed out, there are easier ways to get laid.  Mr. Goldblum and the entire cast are good but they have very little to do except mugg and pretend to fumble around.  Premise is that Mr. G has a young Canadian fianc (Ms. Wreford), who, for some reason, can't get back into the US.  Somehow this requires him to participate in the regional production of Music Man. Huh?  If they are engaged, why don't they just get married?  Problem solved.  But then you wouldn't have a movie (a good outcome for all involved).  There are also a couple of pointless sub-plots about Ms. Douglas' relationship issues and Mr. Begely's  promotion of solar cells.",1401408000,3,1137,4.83419689119171
8204012,4,B000S1MMD4,"This film was a wonderfully delightful light hearted comedy.  It really was a credit to the Pittsburgh area and had a nice happy ending.  I liked the fact that the film really disclosed the arrogant side of Hollywood and how when I person gets to a certain level of success it is frowned upon if they try to do something at a local level to help out their friends, family and community.  Jeff Goldblum played 'himself' very well, always witty and comical.  The film complimented the aspects of live stage theater and how much dedicated hard work goes into a production.  I recommend this film as a must see for any Jeff Goldblum fan or person interested in Pittsburgh.",1370995200,,668,4.579831932773109

8204014,4,B000S1MMD4,"I caught this on cable a couple years ago and enjoyed it. When I brought it up to my girlfriend and found out she hadn't watched it, I decided it was worth buying a used copy on Amazon.
Item arrived in great shape, better than I had expected.
The movie is peppered with cameos, some a little longer than others, of Jeff's celebrity friends, which is fun.
Ed Begley Jr's attempt to drag Jeff into his projects is fun to watch.
Jeff is his usual quirky self, so if you are a fan of his, you will not be disappointed.
I don't buy many movies these days, but I feel it is worth picking up at a great price.
Now, if I come across anyone else that hasn't watched it, I can pull out my copy.
Also, you can't find this movie on iTunes, Netflix, or Redbox, so it's definitely worth picking up for around $5 on here.",1328918400,,806,4.1075949367088604
