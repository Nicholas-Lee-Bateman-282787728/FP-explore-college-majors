5015435,5,B006T0R1XY,"Beautiful Venice.  Great plots.  Took some time getting used to German being spoken rather than Italian.  The characters used
Italian with greetings.  The actors are true to the characters in the books otherwise.",1362614400,,212,5.333333333333333
5015436,4,B006T0R1XY,"It's always a bit off-putting to hear our Italian heroes speaking German but one can get used to it. After all, it's still Venice and the characters are simpatici!",1354752000,,163,4.655172413793103
5015437,4,B006T0R1XY,"Consistently good production of the Leon series. Never heavy handed acting, but miss hearing Italian spoken. The scenes of Venice are always evocative and mysterious.",1353888000,,166,5.68
5015438,5,B006T0R1XY,fascinating tv. the only drawback is that it is in German with subtitles. cinematography is beautiful. interesting to see the stories come to life.,1351382400,,147,5.166666666666667
5015439,5,B006T0R1XY,"I've read all the Donna Leon books and find them (mostly) fabulously written, interestingly plotted, with well fleshed out characters. And Venice is one of the most prominent in all of them, of course. Now comes this German-produced translation to the screen. Super well done, captures the essence of the books. The casting is superb, the photography stunning. A perfect score despite the mind bending hearing of German as the language in Venice. Subtitles are good, and the German being spoken is clear enough that I can process much of with with my high school German skills. If it were in Italian, would be over the top.",1336348800,12,623,4.831775700934579
5015440,5,B006T0R1XY,"I love the novels, was astounded to learn that they had been made into a German series, and immediately started ordering them.  I was disappointed that the shows are in German rather than Italian, but the English subtitles are excellent and the language wasn't a problem for long at all.  The characters are very close to what I've imagined they would look like, particularly the Vice Questore Patta and the ever helpful Signorina Elletra!  The stories closely track the novels.  Brunetti's pursuit of justice in the face of the corruption endemic to Italy's institutions -- the governments, the Catholic church and organized crime -- is intelligent and dogged.  His family is a strong counterpoint to his constant involvement in crime.  The shows were apparently filmed on location, as I recognized many of the locations where he and his assistant, Inspettore Vianello, are seen.  There are many beautiful long shots of Venice, one of the loveliest places on earth.  I love the way Brunetti and Vianello use the water taxi vaporettos to travel around the city, just like the tourists!",1336176000,9,1085,5.022346368715084
5015441,5,B006T0R1XY,I have all of this series and waiting for more.  I love the strong characters and beautiful scenery of Venice.,1334188800,,110,4.5
5015442,5,B006T0R1XY,"like all the Donna Leon, Commisario Brunetti series and hope to purchase the rest of the episodes as soon as they are available.",1329523200,,128,4.608695652173913
5015443,5,B006T0R1XY,Never disappointed with Donna Leon's books! This German series scores top points in terms of incredible acting and authentic set design- filmed in glorious Venice.,1415577600,,163,5.56

5015445,5,B006T0R1XY,"Great series, only small change with shift to a different actor for Brunetti after the first 4 shows.",1406678400,,101,4.666666666666667
5015446,5,B006T0R1XY,"Great story and fun to watch. Wish to have more movies like this one.
Fantastic actors with fun personality. I really enjoyed watching this movie.",1393977600,,146,4.88
5015447,4,B006T0R1XY,Commissario Brunetti's thoughtful analysis of the crimes plus the beauty and intrigue of Venice entertained these viewers as well as encouraged us to watch the other mysteries in the series.,1393372800,,190,5.366666666666666
5015448,5,B006T0R1XY,"The Brunetti Mysteries never disappoint, and the scenery is always beautiful.  Like how the dynamics of the family unit are intertwined in each story.",1388016000,,150,5.25
5015449,5,B006T0R1XY,"The entire ""Brunetti"" series is fantastic -- in fact, better than anything on American tv, including PBS.  Just the right combination of suspense and humor against exquisite scenery.  My only criticism is that all these MHZ dvds seem to come in very cheesy cases that break almost immediately if they don't arrive already broken.  It is maddening.",1373846400,,347,5.052631578947368
5015450,4,B006T0R1XY,"I wish this had been an Italian cast speaking Italian with English subtitles.  Uwe Kockisch does his best to look and act like a real Italian, but it's not quite authentic.  Hearing danke instead of Grazie, for example, is a distraction.  A good try, but I will stick with the books.  I think even the German audience would prefer real Italians and their inbred Italian mannerisms to the stiffer German personalities that can't help but be Germans.",1371427200,,448,4.779220779220779
5015451,5,B006T0R1XY,"Good acting, interesting story lines, Donna Leon good author, no problem with subtitles, learning a little German in the process.  Glad we got started on this series!",1370044800,,166,5.148148148148148
5015452,5,B006T0R1XY,This is a great series with strong family characters and they respect their piers and parents and all seem to work together. I like to see the different generations acting together.,1367193600,,181,4.870967741935484
8503839,2,B006T0R1XY,"I will not add what others have said about dubious and changing casting. This I would be  ready to live with, as long as the main character which is Venice itself was adequately showcased. But it is not. I believe this is not the creators fault  but the fault of Mhz and the image compression techniques they used. The DVD  is produced by MMz and like the Inspector Montalbano  DVD's I have purchased from them, the image quality is horrible. These series, Montalbano and Brunetti feature beautiful settings  and this is an important part of the story for the aficionados  I purchased the DVD's rather than streaming from MHZ in order to get a better image for my large screen TV and to be able to fully appreciate the quality of the series. The Inspector Brunetti images are a bit better than The Montalbano. The backgrounds are a bit sharper. However nothing similar to a good quality DVD. Also on some Brunetti DVDs, when the camera moves the background moves in a stuttering fashion which is very annoying. These are most probably artifacts from the compression process used. Not recommended.",1526169600,,1096,4.742105263157895
