Within the first 10 minutes you are told about Hitler's boyhood in Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany.  That funny considering how Hitler was born and raised in Hapsburg Austria.  Then the scene jumps in split-seconds from World War I to the Beer Hall Putsch (erroneously called Riots in the program) whereupon Hitler goes to prison and turns the Nazi Party over to Joseph Goebbels.  That's funny too, since it was Alfred Rosenberg whom Hitler entrusted the Party to and Hitler and Goebbels didn't even know each other at the time.

Don't waste your money or your time on this ""documentary"".",1481500800,,675,4.87719298245614
8057656,1,B00096S3VS,"I was expecting average to good quality images, instead, both ""documentaries"" are very poorly transferred film to video. The footage is old, faded, and out of focus. The Hitler Diaries contain NO narration, only a poorly base-balled text over the actual image which is distracting at best. The Rape of Nanking is rank amateur, as well. Save your money and purchase other quality documentaries. The WWII ""in color"" series is generally excellent, along with ""The World At War"" and anything by BBC. Good hunting, but nich this one! I would give this Zero stars but must give it one inorder for this commentary to be viewed.",1162944000,9,620,4.8584905660377355
