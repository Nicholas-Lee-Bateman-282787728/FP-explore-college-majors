5276824,4,B0097FLLRU,"THE SWEENEY is a suspenseful movie about the UK's top police task force, which is the UK's watered down version of SWAT. I say watered down, only because it seems strange to me to go up against crooks holding AKs with hickory bats and handguns. If you have much experience with riffles, it might also bother you that the riffle bullets in this movie are easily stopped by basic body armor and car doors seem to be impenetrable. Other than that it's pretty good about realism. The movie it's self is an engaging action thriller. It has a somewhat obvious plot, but lets be honest we don't really watch most police action movies for the amazing plots. The Sweeney, I believe is loosely based on a much older series, which explains it's old school gritty flavor. Detective Jack Regan (Ray Winstone) and his partner, play the bad-ass pretty well. If you like cop action movies, you will probably like this movie.",1362355200,,908,4.645962732919255
5276825,4,B0097FLLRU,"It seems that ""The Sweeney"" has bypassed the US theatres altogether and instead gets released directly onto DVD. But by chance during a recent business trip to Sydney, I noticed the movie was playing in Australian cinemas and I took the opportunity to go see this.

""The Sweeney"" (2012 release from the UK; 112 min.) brings an update/refresh of the movie and subsequent UK TV series from the mid-1970s. As far as the plot is concerned, the movie focuses on the London special crime unit called ""the Sweeney"". As the movie opens we see the unit successfully interrupting a heist, and then going out to celebrate and let off some steam (the latter even literally as we see two of the Sweeney colleagues getting it on). The tension mounts when an interal compliance officer announces that he is going to ""observe"" the unit to make sure it plays by the rules (which of course it doesn't). Then a brutal jewelry hold-up happens, during which one of the innocent bystanders gets brutally killed. Will the Sweeney unit be successful in hunting down the perpetrators? What about the internal review of the unit? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, this is a though and gritty police drama and not for the faint of heart, so viewer beware. I thought the at times dark and always intense tone of the movie was brought very well, and in fact reminded me on several occasions of Michael Mann's ""Thief"" movie some 3 decades ago. Several acting performances are noteworthy, none more so than Ray Winstone, as the veteran Sweeney unit leader. Last but not least, the photography of London in the movie is eye-candy, with numerous air shots that give a dramatic panorama of the City. Bottom line: I have no idea why this movie didn't make it to the big screen in the US, as by all means it should have. If you are in the mood for a tough but action-filled UK police drama, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Sweeney"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1361923200,11,2038,4.6115702479338845

5276827,4,B0097FLLRU,"""As far as I'm concerned there ain't another job in the world that'll give me the kind of buzz this one does."" Jack Reagan (Winstone) is an old school detective that does things his way much to the dismay of IA. He is on the case of a string of bank robberies as well as being investigated by his department for questionable tactics. When something goes wrong and he is stripped of his badge it is up to him to clear his name, stop the bad guy and save his department. I am a big fan of the British cop genre and this one is not a disappointment. Great story and acting makes this very very entertaining. The movie is full of twists which keeps you guessing what is happening and who is on what side right up until the end. That makes a movie fun to watch. This is a under the radar movie that I could keep going on about but if you are a fan of this genre like I am then this is a must see. I really enjoyed this. Overall, one of the better cop movies I have seen in a while. I give it a B+.",1361232000,6,992,3.9158415841584158

5276829,4,B0097FLLRU,"Let me preface this review with a statement that is required for UK residents: Have never seen the original tv program this film is based on.

That said, I was stunned to see some of the harsh and, in my opinion, completely undeserved criticism. (via Amazon.co.uk) And I'm already prepped and ready to take on all comers in stating this:

Fellow film fans in the UK have no concept of what makes a truly bad reboot, revamp, or remake. Let me tell you about being an American who regularly screens disappointment. '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dawn/dp/B002ZG98R8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dawn</a>' or the steaming pile called '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Shadows/dp/B009KHDT0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Shadows</a>' being prime examples. In all sincerity, you guys across the pond have gotten way too used to high quality moviemaking. Spoiled, you need to live here for a while, maybe get a good dose of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Footloose/dp/B002ZG97LK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Footloose</a>'.

Again, I'm prepped. Simply because in order to ""defeat"" me, you have to provide lousier examples of bad filmmaking. Sadly, in that category, we Americans have you beat hands down. And because Brits almost never produce something lousy, the weight of evidence is greater on your shoulders. Oh certainly there's adequate, uninspired, and repetitive - but never lousy. In my experience, there's usually something good to say about all UK film productions. Unlike Hollywood, which consistently churns out lousy like the receiving end results of a competitive eater's toilet.

As mentioned, and for those not acquainted with 1970s UK television, this is a reboot of the classic hardcore cop drama featuring a team of famous no-nonsense investigators - The Flying Squad. As of this writing, a retired division within the metropolitan police service of London whose history dates back nearly one-hundred years.

The specialized service was tasked as an action force dedicated to assess, prevent and interdict organized robbery crews. A seemingly straight forward mission. But like previous team leaders, the current head and his lieutenant, Jack Regan and George Carter respectively, came up the hard way. Resentful of paper-pusher cops and desk-bound computer arrests, the pair knows that to catch a dirty thief, sometimes you have to get just as dirty. No laptop is going to break a suspect, no legalese stack of charges will stop hardcore recidivism. Knocking heads is what these lowlifes know and that's what they're used to - so that's what they're going to get.

As squad leader, Jack often finds himself racing along a razor thin line between civil servant and criminality. Repeatedly blurring that line, much to the barely concealed contempt of his immediate superiors. But he delivers the goods - arrests and successful prosecutions - so he and his team are left alone.

Until he encounters a gang like no other.

Without realizing it, the squad's success becomes the foundation for their destruction. Savvy criminals have worked out that fighting Sweeney isn't working. Instead, they realize that in order to beat the squad, they have to adopt their tactics; turning them against itself. By employing counter-intelligence to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities, studying the behaviors and patterns of their foes, and essentially laying out an elaborate trap which the team can't help themselves but to fall into. Doing to Jack what was done to them for so long.

His team destroyed, his reputation in ruins, and stuck in a prison filled to the brim with brutal convicts; many of whom owe their incarceration to him personally. His life is over.

But can one really keep bull of a man like Jack Regan down?

Hardcore tough and thoroughly enjoyable flick with one of my favorite versatile performers in the form of barrel-chested, testosterone-infused Ray Winstone.

Really hope they do another film.

Movie Notes:

- From Wikipedia: The programme's title derives from Sweeney Todd, which is Cockney rhyming slang for 'Flying Squad'.

- One of the most notable missions of The Sweeney was preventing the Millennium Dome Heist. Interdicting a professional gang of thieves from nicking over a half-a-billion dollars in diamonds belonging to De Beers, including the stunning 203 carat Millennium Star, by itself having a shocking value of USD$400 million.

- Was the basis for the wildly popular US version: '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shield/dp/B002M2T1UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shield</a>' starring Michael Chiklis.

Personal Note:

- I honestly believe every filmmaker who does a modern showdown owes a debt of gratitude to Michael Mann's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat/dp/B003WYXJRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat</a>'. <g>",1359417600,54,4976,5.830578512396694

Wouldn't mind seeing more of this. Nick Love deserves a lot of credit for putting up w/ Clarkson Hammond & May while filming the chase scenes, I really think he thought they were going to help.

Every time I give this one a look,  I am awed by the sound track.  Winstone was very fine in The Tracker,  but that film doesn't come up to the kneecaps of  The Sweeney.

I had hoped that this movie would not be quite as bad as many have said but unfortunately it was. The original Sweeney had grit, pathos and humor and was considered by members of the Flying Squad from that era to be reasonably close to accurate in its portrayal of their activities. It was in my opinion the best British cop show of all time and John Thaw and Dennis Waterman were perfectly cast. This on the other hand was a formulaic cop movie with a silly plot and a waste of the talent on show. Ray Winstone is a great actor (Sexy Beast and Scum are truly excellent movies that showcased his talents well) but he's utterly miscast here. Why Plan B was cast I have no clue but he bore no relation to the character of George Carter and can barely act. Atwell, Mackintosh and Lewis did their best but this is not something that they will want front and center of their resumes.

Overall, I really enjoyed the movie although there are more than a few scenes that seemed implausible.  In fact, one of the most pivotal scenes was predictable and frustrating as the leader of the squad, Regan, puts his team (and London's citizens) in a situation that could only be described as inexcusably irresponsible.  The disastrous results of that choice become that much more unforgiveable, making Regan come down in my estimation for the remainder of the film.  Despite this, it's a worthy film for the mere fact that, yet again, the Brits show their acting skills are worthy of admiration.  NOTE: The strong London Cockney accent is so strong that, at times (and depending on which character is speaking), American audiences may need the benefit of subtitles.",1453939200,,908,5.060402684563758

5276860,3,B0097FLLRU,"Way back in the Seventies THE SWEENEY was seen as a groundbreaking police drama, its gritty stories and violent sequences setting a standard that few rival series could match.  The series made stars of John Thaw and Dennis Waterman, and spawned two films, neither of which really approached the television drama in terms of quality and sharpness of writing (from Troy Kennedy Martin).  Nick Love's remake adds some more earthy language, but basically keeps close to the structure of the television series, with the use of realistic London locations and deliberately washed out color photography.  Ray Winstone's Regan is perhaps more world-weary than John Thaw; the way he mumbles his lines is reminiscent of an English Marlon Brando.  Although this kind of role is made for Winstone's craggy features, he seems a little too old and portly for a tough, no-nonsense cop.  Ben Drew, as Regan's sidekick Carter, doesn't have too much to do other than to reveal an enduring loyalty to his superior - he seems a little colorless, as if believing in his heart of hearts that he could not match Waterman's characterization in the television series.  Damian Lewis turns up as Haskins, the Flying Squad's boss - once again he seems too young for the role, lacking the gravitas that Garfield Morgan brought to the television series.  The direction is fast, and there are plenty of action sequences to cover up some of the more implausible aspects of the plot (how Regan gets sprung out of jail is anyone's guess).

In my movies, I like to root for the good guy, sneer at the bad guy, and watch the good guy get the bad guy in the end. Not a complicated plot, I know, but this doesn't mean that I don't think characters should have depth and motivations. I think that those are core to a great movie. Sorry, I should rephrase, movies should have CLEAR motivations.

In this film, the motivations are so cluttered and seemingly misguided that I started to lose respect for everyone (good and bad). I really like Ray Winstone and Damian Lewis but I was constantly confused by their roles. I started questioning everyone's actions. This could have been a great crime movie but if you're looking for a good guy to just take down some bad guys ""Man on Fire"", or even ""Safe"" with Jason Statham, is a better choice. And for Prime users, Safe is FREE. That concludes the spoiler free part of the review.

***spoiler alert***

It's hard to root for the good guys when the good guys are crooked...and for seemingly NO REASON. At one point, one character seems to start to grow a conscience and then decides to forget it and go kill a bunch of people (albeit baddies) for his buddy. On top of that, it seems nobody minds. The general feeling I got from this movie is that it was made by a bunch of teenagers who thought, ""Let's make a story about a squad of awesome and hardcore people. What makes someone awesome and hardcore?"". After several Mountain Dew 2-liters, their answer was: ""someone who does whatever they want and gets away with it because they are awesome and hardcore!!"". Seems like circular logic to me and that's how this movie felt. Great heroes can be complicated and dark (see: Batman) but they are dark for a very good reason but they overcome their past issues and are ultimately logical and moral. These heroes were just thugs with a badge...

Sorry ""The Sweeney"", but you are the one who is ""nicked"" in this case.",1380499200,,2063,4.579945799457994

The Flying Squad is a controversial elite unit of the London police force that became famous via a 1970s British TV series entitled ""The Sweeney."" At least as portrayed in the show and in several subsequent theatrical films, the squad is often seen as acting outside the strict limits of the law when that becomes necessary to get their man.

This 21st Century update stars Ray Winstone as Detective Inspector Jack Regan and Ben Drew as Detective Constable George Carter, along with a half dozen or so other actors (including Damian Lewis of ""Homeland"" fame) who together make up the team. In this installment, the unit is pursuing a man who shot a seemingly random woman during a jewelry store heist.

""The Sweeney"" features strong acting, solid action sequences and enough character angst to keep us interested, if not exactly intrigued, with the proceedings, but there's really not a whole lot that distinguishes it from countless other works in the genre, be they in movies or on TV.",1379635200,2,995,4.875739644970414
5276868,3,B0097FLLRU,"This is a ""gritty"" policy drama in the style of the 1970s. Expect lots of car chases and people being beaten up. There are no surprises in the plot; when a pretty female character hands an earring to her lover, asking him to hang onto it until after they complete this bust, you know she's going to die. That said, it looks pretty good -- very high contrast, lots of lovely night shots in London. Ray Winstone feels natural in the lead. Only three stars because the movie failed for me on two levels. First, it included too many of the genre's plot staples. I can't list them all here without spoiling the movie, but I will say that I thought the rivalry between Winstone and ""internal affairs"" was pointless, as was the brief segment in which Winstone is thrown in jail and has to defend himself against the vengeful thugs he had nicked. These could easily have been bumped to ""The Sweeney II,"" leaving this movie less cluttered.

Second, the sound production on the film is lousy. Gunshots and revving engines are terrifically loud, and conversations are typically mumbled or growled. There is no volume at which you could follow everything being discussed by the characters without causing permanent hearing trauma once the action starts up again.",1378339200,,1250,4.73394495412844
5276869,3,B0097FLLRU,"The film's cinematography is strong, which the acting and dialog fail to match. The quasi-postmodern views of London give the city an edgy vibe and the shootout in Trafalgar Square in front of the National Gallery will impress most viewers. Ray Winstone (DI Regan) performs well, although his character's relationship with DC Lewis, played competently by Hayley Atwell, stretches credibility. Second-billed Ben Drew improves in the latter part of the movie, but casting Allen Leech as Drew's DC Carter and giving Drew the smaller role of DC Ellis might have made a stronger film. The script could have developed more fully some members of Regan's squad, as well as Damian Lewis, who played insignificant roles.",1377475200,,710,5.182608695652174

There's some noteworthy set pieces none more so than a shootout in Trafalgar Square that's reminiscent of a similar scene in Michael Mann's ""Heat"".  Watching it the jaw drops in how-did-they-do-that amazement.  As the leader of the elite police squad Ray Winstone brings the same brutish charisma to the proceedings that he offers in his gangster roles.  Newcomer Ben Drew as Winstone's protg shows promise.  I understand he's a rapper in Britain so there is room for a second career.  The tough uncompromising nature of the film may not be for all tastes but if you're a fan of British cops-and-robbers films this is something of a fair to middling offering.",1373587200,,774,4.915384615384616

5276874,2,B0097FLLRU,"I wasn't expecting an exact comparison to the 70's British TV show, but this was a very disappointing movie. Anyone who has seen the original show, knows that Regan (played by John Thaw) had many personalities, but Ray Winstone (who I am a big fan of, by the way), just seems to play a thug walking around with a constipated look on his face. The worst of the bunch was Ben Drew, who I thought was badly miscast as George Carter (originally played by Dennis Waterman). Most of the other Flying Squad crew were instantly forgettable in the predictable mush of a plot except for Damian Lewis who stood out and did a good job as Haskins and Paul Alexander playing the top bad guy. Other characters include Alan Ford who always plays the cockney villain in every British bad guy movie, Hayley Atwell who starred in Captain America and Allen Leech who plays Tom Branson in Downton Abbey.
If you are interested in the Sweeney, watch the original shows, Regan the pilot episode or the two spin off movies from 1977 & 1978, all of which are better than this.",1373068800,,1050,4.50261780104712

Ray Winstone is one of the world's most watchable actors and it's really only due to his charisma that his character, Jack Regan is remotely bearable - as written he's a boorish, irresponsible neanderthal bully, far more dangerous to his colleagues than any villains. It's arguable that Winstone hasn't played a character this repulsive since the searing 'Nil by Mouth', trouble is in 'The Sweeney' he's supposed to be the bloody hero- welcome to today's police force!

The rest of the cast is appealing and capable but don't get much to do apart from having their lives and jobs threatend by Winstone's nightmare character. Sad to say Ben Drew is miscast in this, he looks too young and completetly unimposing as Winstone's partner. And he seems to have taken a leaf from Winstone's book in the beligerent knuckelhead dept. Both he and Haley Atwell will no doubt do have much better roles suited to them in the future.

5276896,4,B0097FLLRU,"I hadn't heard of the elite British crime squad known as Flying Squad, or commonly known as ""Sweeney"" prior to watching this UK actioner starring Ray Winstone. The film is inspired by the real life Flying Squad of the London Metropolitan police force, officers set on stopping and preventing armed crimes. Winstone's character Regen leads his group of hardened officers to bring down the mastermind behind a seemingly straightforward armed robbery. Loyalties and relationships are put to the test, while authority is challenged all in the name of justice. Veteran Winstone drives the film as a tough as nails leader, while his younger crew made up of Ben Drew and Hayley Atwell among others impress as well. From the opening scene I knew this was my style of movie - the wild introduction of the Sweeney capturing some bad guys was both humorous and thrilling. The sleek crime flick features shootouts reminiscent of Heat, adrenaline-fueled car chases, and a story with enough twists and turns to keep things interesting. The film is cleanly shot, gritty where it needs to be, and is ultimately insanely entertaining. I would have liked to have seen a little more depth with the characters - while there are a few hints here and there dealing with characters personal dilemmas, the focus seems ultimately to be on the action. All in all the film is well done, gripping, and gives you everything you look for in a crime action flick. The Blu-ray video and sound quality are excellent, which does a film like this justice.

Led by legendary Detective Jack Regan (Ray Winstone), the squad is not afraid to use old-school, bare-knuckle tactics to bring down the modern underworld.  Now, with a master criminal (Paul Anderson) on the loose and a major bank heist in progress, Regan will do whatever it takes to get the job done, even if that means defying the orders of his boss (Damian Lewis) and taking the law into his own hands.

The members of the squad are stereotypes -- the Irish guy, the black guy, the jokester, and the one you know will not make it to the final credits alive.  There's also an Internal Affairs bureaucrat bent on bringing down Regan and his team. The R-rated film contains violence, strong language, alcohol abuse, and sexual situations.

I'm British but now live in the US so I can understand many US viewers having never seen the TV series so can't make a comparison. Well, the UK Sweeney fans are wrong to say that it's nothing like the original because the movie, to me anyway, is a kind of remake of the original TV movie called Regan. In that (and it's novel form), Regan is a loner who does things his own way and has little respect for his superiors who are more worried about bad publicity than Regan actually catching criminals. In the original TV movie, Carter was a young, ambitious, Detective Sergeant who was looking out for himself and only later aligned himself with Jack - kind of familiar, huh? This is a great crime movie and anyone who's ever read Ian Kennedy-Martin's novels based on the series will recognize the characters from this movie, not the TV series where Regan and Carter were already best mates. I love the tone they took in the movie - dark, violent and unforgiving. Lots of bad reviews by people comparing it to the TV series and thinking that's who Regan and Carter were.

This violent R-rated actioner will have you covering your eyes, stifling your giggles and checking your watch. The kindest thing I can say is that maybe this is a pilot for a re-launch of the series.

This is a formulaic bunch of nonsense suffering from an overdose of testosterone: brutal, bloody, and profane. It features the worst gunfight in the history of cinema. The squad itself is effective (even thought they can't hit the broad side of a barn), but its methods are so shocking we are left with no one to root for.

We see:
  * Damian Lewis (""Homeland"") I knew things were bad when I couldn't even root for DCI Frank Haskins. Lewis is an actor who could even give Soames Forsyte a bit of humanity in ""The Forsyte Saga.""
  * Ray Winstone (""Hugo"") is DI Jack Regan, brutal, vicious and, according to his mistress, pretty good in bed. I was surprised he put out his cigarette long enough to have sex. He always looks like he needs a shower.
  * Hayley Atwell (""The Duchess"") is DC Nancy Lewis, married to DCI Ivan Lewis and getting it on with DI Jack Regan.
  *  Steven Mackintosh (Lots of TV) is tightly-wound DCI Ivan Lewis, married to the gal who...oh you know, boilerplate misbehavior and ersatz scandal...if only we cared...
  * Ben Drew (""Turnout"") is DC George Carter, an Eminem look-alike, hoodie and all, a young copper who clearly admires his brutal, slightly bent boss.

We are treated to station-house humor: extremely vulgar and obviously relished by all the guys on screen. We in the audience didn't catch many of the jokes because we either couldn't hear or understand them.

5276908,3,B0097FLLRU,"I have not seen ""Sweeney"" the popular British police TV series from the '70s.
I tend to think the police TV series from that era were more civilized and subtle.
After watching this new update film about a team of crime busters within the metropolitan police of London,
I got the impressions that the filmmakers made this film targeting the violence-loving younger audience and AR15 fancy crowd.
The film is about a team of 'elite', 'throw-away-the-book', wooden club toting, never hesitate to pull the trigger
bunch of crime busters under the banner of police whose thuggish and self-important behavior made this viewer
wished to root for the criminals.
Ray Winston, the veteran British actor whom I admired played the leader of the gang(Sweeney) who carried on a torrid
affair with one of his younger female subordinates who's also the estranged wife of his higher ranking police official.
The passionate sex scenes between the couple kind of tarnished Winston's tough guy screen statue, especially one scene
that exposed his naked prominent gut.
Ben Drew who played Winston's deputy did not leave much impressions.
Damien Lewis who plays Winston's superior was left standing around without much to do.

5276909,3,B0097FLLRU,"Look,I agree with previous reviewers' as far as the story goes for this film. Even if the plot is all over the place, on the whole I still enjoyed it. However ,I am skeptical about certain aspects of the characters and the way some of the action panned out. It just didn't ring true for me and I'll have you know I am the kind of person who is willing to stretch the imagination to the limit.
In Australia we saw the original series on television and even though I was very young I still remember that this special team of cops 'The Flying Squad' were an elite team dedicated to the task of bringing down the most hardened and professional of robbery crews.
This led by British hard man of the time John Thaw. Fit, lean and very tough. Now, in my opinion Ray Winstone didn't quite fit the bill. Don't get me wrong ,I love Ray Winstone and have seen just about everything he's been in. He is quite the tough character,but there was talk of Tom Hardy playing the role ,who I thought would have been more suited.
WARNING, Spoiler ahead.
Case in point,Ray's character in the film  having an affair with Hayley Atwell's character who is also in the squad. I just didn't buy it. Have you SEEN this girls figure ? She's HOT.A voluptuous brunette,quite good looking who is a slightly slimmer,British version of Christina Hendricks from Mad Men(look her up on youtube,interview with Craig Ferguson,she's wearing a blue dress,you'll see what I mean)The fact that she's a married women who's having an affair with a fat, balding ,average looking bloke who's at least fifteen years older than her ,well , as I said, I didn't buy it. Tom Hardy sure ,but Ray ? I don't know, maybe I'm being too picky and maybe her character was drawn to the power and position of Ray's character but this wasn't explored. I am a big fan of Hayley's, so maybe I'm biased ,even though I didn't really buy into the fact that SHE wouldn't be in a squad like that herself and this showed through in some of the action scenes. She runs like a duck,not athletic at all.
I have to be critical of the last action scene as well, where Ray's offsider George Carter gets slammed fair in the hip by a car going at least 50k's an hour. He doesn't leap up and bounce off the bonnet and then rebound off the windscreen,he would have wound up in hospital for sure, but in the last scene he's sitting at his desk with his ARM in a sling ???? Come on !!!
I can see why it wasn't released in American cinemas', probably because they do this kind of thing better. Having said that and being perhaps overly critical, you should still check it out. The acting is superb with a great support cast. Damian Lewis of 'Homeland' who is under used I might add, playing the all suffering ""Guvna"" .You can cut the tension with a knife in some of the scenes' because Hayleys husband is the head of Internal Affairs who are investigating  The Sweeney  because the old school methods they use to get their collars are outdated ,and he hates Regans guts to boot.
