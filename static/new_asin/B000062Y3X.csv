I think they should re-write the movie and tell more of the story correct. So we can learn more about the Tom Williams.",1422576000,,246,4.25531914893617
7957971,3,B000062Y3X,"The dvd arrived on time and in good shape.  The problem I have with the movie is the plot was all wrong.  The lead character (Tom Williams) was my partner at the time of his killing.  The real killer, Danny Jenkins, was an honest to god ""real"" killer"".  After my daughter views the movie I'm sending to a ""real"" director and see if I can get it done right.  Tom deserved more than this piece of sh-t movie.  The expression on Tom's face while lying dead on the street next to his truck speaks volumes.  He had a message to give to his brother officers, especially concerning the bounty on cops today.",1421884800,,600,4.303571428571429
