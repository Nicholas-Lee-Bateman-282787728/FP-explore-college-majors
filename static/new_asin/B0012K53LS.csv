8246377,3,B0012K53LS,"The two bios of Mantle and Berra are not great: they have some overlapping footage, and they don't do a very good or very detailed job of talking about Mantle and Berra themselves. If you're a devoted fan of the '40s, '50s, and '60s Yankees there won't be too much here that you haven't seen or heard elsewhere. The technical quality of the bios is pretty low as well. But, the bonus hour-long Max Patkin profile is nice. If you're a fan of baseball lore and the lighter side of the game, or just a Patkin fan, it'll be a treat to watch Patkin do his routine at minor league parks, travel from town to town, talk about his life, and reflect on its sadness, disappointments, and pleasures. It's apparently the only substantial look at Patkin available on video.",1251244800,,760,4.474820143884892
