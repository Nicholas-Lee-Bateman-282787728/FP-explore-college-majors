Fortunately, the songs were well-written and performed. Otherwise, I would have been mostly bored. Overall, it was a mixed bag in terms of comedy, although it did have a few amusing insights into the over-the-top-ness of rock bands.

Period.

Everything about it is fantastic, from the improv-type scenes to the cameos to the music (written by the cast).  Spinal Tap casts a massive shadow among musicians and metal fans everywhere.  It's pretty much required viewing or you lose your membership card to the cool kid club.

It's also one of the most quotable films of all time, with several lines becoming part of rock culture legend.

181422,5,1559408758,"Sitting at home on bedrest after spending 19 days in the hospital with a near deadly case of pneumonia (9 of which I was in a medically induced coma!!) I picked out a bunch of movies ----just randomly,and ""This Is Spinal Tap"" made the cut. I watched it 3 times in a row! HILARIOUS  does not sufficiently describe this masterpiece. The film came out in 82'--so what took me so long to finally watch it! you ask??? Well back in said 82'-I was 19 -I had vaguely heard of the film,so one afternoon after partaking in some herbal product, I convinced my 18 yr old BF and our 2 best friends-also 18-19---that this was a kickass metal movie-so we all went-and basically after about 20 minutes my friends -and me, decided this was a weird horrible movie and bolted.
YES-we thought ""Spinal Tap"" was a real band, and unfortunately none of us had yet grasped the idea of satire and irony--the jokes flew over our baked heads.
Well better late than never---this is now officially one of my favorite movies of all time, I am obsessed with Christopher Guest  and have a list of all the movies he had done since--(best in show ect...)
I love how TIST -nearly 40 years later is just as relevant and current as it is. Watching the band on their ""comeback"" tour performing as a second act at a puppet show-or simply to a measly and uninterested audience is painful-and side splitting, I could go on and on-but I basically suggest that you watch it yourself-don't wait decades like I did--this was the perfect remedy to boring bedrest!!!",1468713600,8,1518,4.536496350364963

181637,5,1559408758,"This is the gold standard of Christopher Guest style improv films.

There is not a full script to This Is Spinal Tap. There was just a general outline to the film. The actors created their own lines on the spot. Hilarity ensued. I mean, if you cant' have fun putting a tiny Stonehenge in front of a bunch of actors and seeing how they react, you're just not trying.

The whole thing is just perfectly made. It's just far and away one of the funniest movies ever made. It actually looks and feels like a real documentary.

If you can get your hands on the DVD I HIGHLY recommend watching that version because it includes a full length audio commentary. The audio commentary is just as good as the movie. It's done with the original actors reprising their roles as Spinal Tap watching the 1982 documentary 15-20 years later and ad libing their lines again discussing what's happened since the documentary was made.

This is an almost perfectly executed movie in what it's trying to do.  It's basically making fun of the hard rock and metal scenes of the time.  And it's just an utter joy to watch front to back.

And in spite of the movie being a parody, the music is surprisingly good.  It doesn't take itself seriously, but it is fun to listen to, and is something you might be humming to yourself later.

The movie itself basically follows a hard rock band during a downswing in their careers, as they tour across the United States in support of a much maligned new record they are releasing.  Disasters befall them at just about every stop, and the band attempts to work past the many obstacles they face during this time.

181716,4,1559408758,"""This is Spinal Tap"" was Christopher Guest's first foray into so-called ""mockumentary"", a comedic genre in which satire and farce are presented in the form of a documentary film focusing on a fictional subject. One of the first of the genre was ""Take the Money and Run"" written, directed and starring Woody Allen. Spinal Tap is a fictional heavy metal rock band originating from Britain, a cross between ""The Who"", ""Alice Cooper"", ""Black Sabbath"", and ""Def Leppard"". The font used for the name on film posters and other media paraphernalia are similar to those used by many heavy metal bands popular during the late 1970's and 1980's, often of a neo-medieval/gothic style. Rob Reiner, who directs, plays a fictional documentary/commercial filmmaker who presents a behind-the-scenes expos of a rock band whose loudness and punctuality are of legendary status.

""This is Spinal Tap"" pokes fun at some of the ""rockumentaries"" which were in vogue in the 1980's, giving audiences and fans glimpses into the behind-the-scenes world of famous rock bands. This mockumentary-rockumentary lampoons such documentaries such as VH1's ""Behind the Music"" with a satirical harpoon large enough to catch the likes of Ozzie Osbourne, Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Joe Elliot and a host of other heavy metal musicians in one swoop. Marty Di Bergi, the fictional documentary filmmaker played by Rob Reiner gives a short introduction to the film dedicated to the band he first saw at a place called ""The Electric Banana"" in Greenwich Village during the 1960's, which, he explains doesn't exist any more. (If he didn't say that, you know some heavy metal groupies would be looking for it.)

The film is a series of bits including interviews with groupies, fans, promoters, producers, and of course the band members. On-stage chicanery and behind-the-scenes mayhem become the cornerstone from which ""This is Spinal Tap"" emerges. Christopher Guest plays the lead guitarist Nigel ""Tuffy"" Tufnel, a Birmingham, England bloke with a heavy working-class cockney accent sporting a hairstyle like late Beatles and The Who. His character is a cross between Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, and the late Randy Rhoades of Ozzy. David St. Hubbins played by Michael McKean, is the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the band. His character seems to be based on David Lee Roth when he was lead singer for Van Halen and Steve Clark, rhythm guitarist of Def Leppard. A short clip of the band's ""early years"" in black and white out-of-focus video with the band in bland suits and jackets with the trademark elevated drummer sets the stage for much of the silliness which follows. Only two bands which continued from the 1960's and into the 1980's which could have looked like that and play the kind of heavy metal in vogue in the 1980's would be The Who and maybe The Rolling Stones. The bands they lampoon largely came into existence during the 1970's.

Many of the bits are actually not as over-the-top as you might believe because of the chaos which haunts heavy metal musicians, both in terms of off-stage buffoonery and on-stage antics. In one memorable bit, the band is singing their newly-composed hit ""Stonehenge"" and a replica of one of the stones is lowered onstage--but it's not quite as dramatic as it should be! Another is when Guest shows Reiner his collection of guitars and amps. All amps in the industry go up to a maximum of 10 in terms of volume, but Spinal Tap's amps go up to 11! ""That's '1' louder!"" proclaims Guest.

If you know anything about the heavy metal and pop music scene and would like a no-holds-barred satire about that Alice-in-Wonderland world, this is definitely for you. By the mid-to-late 1970's heavy metal rock bands, spear-headed by the likes of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath garnered huge followings in Europe and North America. They became so-called ""super-groups"" and were the voices of late Boomers and early Generation X'ers who enjoyed wearing black and other non-conformist clothing, riding motorcycles and taking recreational drugs. They were in a sense the next evolution in rebellious youth making the hippies of a half-generation earlier seem tame by comparison. ""This is Spinal Tap"" pokes fun at this world but not in a disparaging way. However, if you believe these people should be placed on pedestals and worshipped like Gods, ""This is Spinal Tap"" might bring you up from your knees. In a real-life story, Ozzy Osbourne was once asked about his house burning down. He replied he wanted to know if beer was flammable! And yes it is! This could have been a scene in ""This is Spinal Tap"" but actually it wasn't!",1431648000,,4651,4.958974358974359

181799,5,1559408758,"Ironically, although the ""mock"" in this mockumentary is directed at various shades of rock between the British Invasion and the hair band era, the music of ""Spinal Tap"" is actually quite good. At the very least, it's good at being bad, and that's sometimes more than enough to get a song to the top of the charts. It's not exactly the quality, but the believability of the music being lampooned that makes ""Spinal Tap"" a great piece of satire. Like any good band documentary, the story of Spinal Tap is told through their music: they had more artistic phases than The Beatles, more previous members than Black Sabbath, and fell from grace like Guns 'N Roses, and at every stage their material is brilliantly, unmistakably derivative of those legends and their ilk. It's one thing to know exactly what's pretentious and corny and laughable about those acts, great as they all were, but it's another and deeply impressive thing to be able to showcase their excesses through music. Spinal Tap's early, Ed Sullivan-esque days sees them in mop tops and suits, singing jangly, catchy, teeny-bopper pop that really feels imported from the mid 1960s. Same for their flower- power days, the absurd put-ons of their goth rock era, the wanna-be virtuoso indulgence of their progressive experimentalism, and most of all, their preening, testosterone-driven glam rock of the late 1970s and early 80s. This last subgenre is the one the movie skewers most ruthlessly: the ridiculous songs ""Heavy Duty"" and ""Big Bottom"" are two of the wittiest and most scatological in the film, and at the same time are only slight exaggerations of real-life analogues.

Much of the non-musical material in ""Spinal Tap"" works just as brilliantly. The script is quotable in the extreme. It is concise and cutting with its observations on the music industry, as in hilarious dispute over a sexist album cover between a label executive (Fran Drescher) and Christopher Guests's oblivious lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (one of many delightfully English names in the film).

At times, the movie is as earnest and emotional as real band documentaries can be. The Lennon/McCartney-inspired arc between best friends Nigel and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) could almost have been the focus of a straight drama. Near the end, that storyline strains the mockumentary format as the proportion of sentiment to snark shifts in favor of the former, but by this time the points have been scored. Spinal Tap has all the foibles of history's great rock bands, so it would be unfair, and inaccurate, if they didn't take on their essential likability, too.",1423180800,,2606,5.016166281755196
181800,5,1559408758,"This is a movie that has so much subtlety you pick up on each viewing and IMHO the hallmark of the mockumentry style film. The film follows the 'Loudest' band in the world as they attempt a comeback tour which is a disaster from go to fro.

From the laugh out loud moments which mostly involve the band being on stage (the malfunction of props / Stonehenge / the final drummer change) to the subtle interactions and pacing of the film are just perfect. It is a send up of the 80's style rock / hair metal type bands and it hits so close to home it has actually transcended the film and the band Spinal Tap lives on. It mocks the entire music industry as well as 80s subculture

I've read conflicting reports that most or some of the script was improvised and if that is the case then it is amazing acting. The three leads (and Ian / Marty) all are so brilliantly committed to character they pulled out some amazing ad lib moments if they were not scripted.

There is so many great moments in this film its a repeat watching film and it is one to watch alone because many of the jokes are so subtle you need that level on concentration to get them and enjoy them for what they are.

Heavy Metal rock is often an unintentional parody, which explains the fact that many original viewers thought this was a documentary.  And the fact is that it's only a slightly enhanced version of the truth.  My business puts me in contact with a fair number of old rockers, and this movie could have easily been about many of them.  From the unenlightened lyrics to the woozy sophomoric philosophy, this captures an age.

It looks great in BluRay and the bad music sounds--perhaps not 'great', but clean. If you're of a certain age you'll see things you remember (and possibly see yourself)--if you're able to see through the tears of laughter.",1420934400,,877,4.7368421052631575

Every musician should own a copy of this. I remember seeing this on TV in the late 80's and couldn't put my head around it at first and only hit record on the VCR in the second half. This is what I had for about 10 years on the end of The Kids Are Alright (The who). I purchased this once available on VHS, then this version on DVD and just recently purchased the Up To 11 edition (With even more extra's). This is one movie I'd buy if they added even 1 extra scene - it's such a cult classic - I love it. I just gave it to my 17 year old nephew and he's already pulling quotes.
I had to watch the movie a few times before I realized how true comic genius it was. It captures a lot of what happened with music in the 70's & 80's that has happened to musicians at one time or another. Being somewhat based on true accounts, it's almost a reality for most musos - no wonder it is one of the most watched amongst tour buses.
I think the reason why it's lasted so long is not so much of the comic value but it had some really good well written songs to accompany the movie. Let alone that they guys actually tour around at various stages playing the songs. I'm sure Steel Panther took the formula. But really - if you're a muso - try and play Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You without laughing.
You won't want to miss Nigel showing his guitar collection with a guitar that cannot be played, his marshall amp that goes up to 11, self exploding drummers, a barber shop rag-ah version of Heartbreak Hotel and the bass players airport security check. Yes this movie has it all.",1418428800,,1806,4.2682215743440235
181832,5,1559408758,"Brilliant, humorous, realistic ""rockumentary"" of the crazy world of a (fictitious) British heavy-metal band's U.S. comeback tour.  Rob Reiner's affectionate satire pokes fun at every aspect of the already-surreal experience that surrounds any band on tour, from the misspelled group's name on the sign that their chauffeur is holding at the airport when the band Spinal Tap first arrives in the U.S., to the smaller and smaller venues, up to and including the departure in mid-tour of the lead guitarist (Nigel Tufnel, played by Christopher Guest) who's had it with the screw-ups.  Anyone who lived through those times and was a fan of a rock band will ""get"" the inside jokes and the absurd but all-too-real situations.  Rob Reiner really knows the bizarre world of touring rock bands and it shows in every scene and every detail.

The movie is essentially flawed though because the story doesn't have much depth and, although it was meant to be just like a documentary, there could be more bizarre, interesting, and funny moments to explore the crazy world of a rock n roll band.

And I didn't even have to explain the running joke about replacing drummers.

I was not so sure this movie would stand the test of 30+ years.  I first saw it in a college theater in 1980-something at a school loaded with music and liberal arts types that thought it was beyond hilarious.

Who won't find this funny? Those who take rock and/or heavy metal music too seriously (or don't understand it all)  and those who don't understand this could be a parody of any bunch of morons who take themselves (whatever their ""art"") too seriously.

Most 80s metal bands were already on the verge of self-parody, but This is Spinal Tap captured the time beautifully. The fictional group seems to be modeled after Status Quo, who started in the 60s as a psychedelic band, before transforming into a rather mindless but energetic hard rock outfit.

The film's writers really understand the rock'n'roll world and parody it with much affection:

* The chronic problem with changing drummers, especially in hard rock bands
* Losing a key member, causing the band to change its musical direction
* Managers and record company people having their own agendas
* Non-musical girlfriends interfering behind the scenes
* The dubious pleasures of life on the road
* Hyped comebacks that may or may not be successful
* Being reduced to playing in smaller and smaller venues

Truth be told, the heavy-metal genre produces just as much quality music as any other rock-and-roll genre (somewhere around 5 to 10 percent of it is good).

What is the point of satirizing something that is substantially misunderstood and underappreciated? It seems to me that satire best lends itself to sacred cows; such as, for example, small town values and community theatre (the targets of satire in Christoper Guest's excellent mockumentary Waiting for Guffman).",1395532800,,687,5.125

Ono-isms, spoofs of other famous songs, excellent caricatures of aging, rock stars who know nothing else, pretty darned amazing. The humor was dry at all the right times, and the ""true-to-life"" feel was pretty spot on. Quite a few laughs throughout, because they played the parts so well. I had no idea the actors were also accomplished musicians- what a hoot. Gotta say my favorite part was when 'Nigel' was doing his masturbatory solo with a guitar in hand, one on the stand and a violin. Great stuff!

Just as PDQ Bach is a Bach or Haydn without a shred of musical taste or ability, so Spinal Tap is a fine example of how The Rolling Stones or Van Halen would have sounded without talent. It gives a wicked nod to Yoko Ono as well. The impotent and malfunctioning stage props are still a gut buster as well.

My two favorite aspects of the movie are the sincerity of the ""interviewer"", and the vacant expression on the lead's face when the ""interviewer"" asks about his amplifier.

182049,5,1559408758,"For some reason, I've been writing quite a few ""compare and contrast"" reviews lately.  Personally, I like all kinds of essays myself, and I also like film, and so therefore those are at least two of the reasons that I like reading reviews and essays from the late-great Roger Ebert.  But do you remember back in junior high, when the teacher made you write essay after essay, and you just rolled your eyes and groaned?  Well, sometimes teachers know best.  (Don't ask them about politics, however, as they're almost always on the ""wrong side.""  At least in my opinion.)

With regards to ""compare and contrast,"" I wrote a ""Carrie"" versus ""Case 39"" review recently.  Personally, I liked the latter more than the former -- and that opinion holds for all of the ""Carrie"" versions -- which seems to contradict the crowd.  I did find a couple of reviews around the web from true horror afficianados who seem to agree with me; they thought that ""Case 39"" was really underrated.  But for the compare-and-contrast part, you'll notice that parents of a young girl tried to kill her at the beginning of each film.  Well at least in the new ""Carrie"" remake; I can't remember the original exactly, but it definitely holds in ""Case 39"" too.  But after that, the films diverge a bit.

""Where is this all going?!?"" you're probably asking to yourself and if you're still reading, which most likely you are not.  But if you are, I wanted to compare and contrast this film with some more recent films made about music.  In particular, I just watched ""Metallica:  Through the Never"" recently, not because I'm a Metallica fan -- I saw them live once but I find them to be mostly a headache-fest of a metal band -- but rather because, on my Apple TV box, when I was perusing films, that film made the assertion that if I liked ""Spinal Tap"" that I would like ""Into the Never"" too.  I thought, ""Killer!  I love 'Spinal Tap' so 'Never' must be great too!""  (By the way:  the dictionary defines ""never"" as being an adverb.  Why is Metallica using it as a noun?  And that reminds me of another ""music"" film:  ""One Direction:  This is Us.""  Now, I believe that the title should be ""One Direction:  This is We.""  Yeah, it sounds strange, but the to-be-and-linking-verb ""is"" might be the clue.  And remember when you answer the phone?  You're supposed to say proudly, ""This is he,"" or ""This is she,"" both examples of the correct-but-odd-sounding-predicate-nominative case.  I highly recommend reading Grammar Girl's musings on these issues; she's excellent:
http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/it-is-i-versus-it-is-me
)

Now, the actors in ""Spinal Tap"" -- at least the characters they are playing -- know little to nothing about adverbs, nouns, or even the more tricky predicate-nominative case.  But who cares?  While this film has fun with the characters, it really never makes fun of them per se.  In reality, even though they're nearly crazy, and even though they don't seem to understand that making the highest volume on an amplifier 11 doesn't make it actually louder than if it were simply 10 (there is always a linear transformation in any of these types of problems, after all), the film will laugh with the characters and not usually at them.  Even the audience will laugh, but they still find these characters oddly charming and mostly sympathetic.  But most important:  this film is clever while doing it.  Very clever.

On the other hand, I found ""Into the Never"" neither entertaining nor clever.  And I recently tried to watch ""Rock of Ages,"" and I hated it too.  The tone was all wrong, and the characters were neither believable nor interesting.  Now, if you watch ""Glee,"" the singers on that very funny TV show do covers of rock songs -- like Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing"" as an example -- and they do those covers in a slightly cheesy manner.  But they are supposed to be cheesy; they're in Glee, for God's sakes!  How many people in any glee clubs that you know are bullies?  But in ""Rock of Ages,"" minus perhaps Tom Cruise, the character are whimps and it just doesn't work.  Rockers are supposed to be tough guys.

I could go on all day, but I hope that you see my point.  And I also hope that you'll think about those junior high days, think about those essays that you wrote that made you hate your teachers.  But maybe you should thank those teachers now, since they gave you a skill, a skill that allows you to give evidence that ""Spinal Tap"" is ""pure awesomeness"" (as Jack Black might say), while ""Metallica:  Into the Never"" and ""One Direction:  This is Us"" not only have possible English issues with regards to their titles, but are also possibly uninteresting films.

Well, their was no drugs and sex, from what I can remember, but still you question the intelligence. The costumes diffidently have not timed well and they should have hired some to write titles for the sound but then the music is fantastic.

Maybe Roger Ebert's review in Great Movies II built it up too much.

But I think the real reason I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would is that it just wasn't that much of a parody. What I mean is that when the actors were singing really stupid lyrics and behaving stupidly and saying stupid things, and when their fans were acting like dumbbells, I just didn't find it funny, because that's how I remember it was actually like back then. I remember in `66, listening to Eve of Destruction, at age 15, and being swept away by the lyrics, and then discovering Bob Dylan with Bringing it all Back Home and Highway 61.

But most of my high school classmates were listening to ""My Baby Does the Hanky Panky"" (the only lyric).

And no, ""Stonehenge"" was not modeled after Black Sabbath's ""Stonehenge"", apparently Meathead and BS came up with the idea simultaneously since the movie was released the same year as Black Sabbath's ""Stonehenge"" set design disaster and had been shot well before that disaster.

The only problem is the bands not as popular as they once had been. Much of their appeal  hasn't lasted in the ""modern day"" (the film was made in the 80s). The comedy of the movie is more subtle and relies mainly on the bands denial of their current popularity, and them trying to regain their fame for their early years. The movie also relies heavy on band cliches from the sixties on. The deleted scenes on here double the size of the movie and I just as funny as the main movie.

182197,5,1559408758,"After all these years, this rocku-mocku-documentary holds fascination for so many people, and why not?  Under the direction of Rob Reiner, this dry little film takes on some brilliantly satirical moments in real British rock groups' histories and twists them so that you get the jokes with fictitious group Spinal Pap--er, Tap--and the results are still as funny as they were when the movie came out in the early 80s.

They once were known as the Originals, but somebody else had the name the Original, so they changed their name to the New Originals...lol.  And who can forget all the drummers that somehow died mysteriously, bad gigs, nobody showing up at a record signing, and getting lost backstage?  A favorite moment is when bassist Derek Smalls (obviously living up to his last name), is forced to pull a foil wrapped cucumber out of his pants during an airport inspection.  ""We've got armadillos in our trousers,"" eh?

David's girlfriend Janine Pettibone is an unlikeable Yoko Ono rock girlfriend who starts a huge rift between Nigel and David a la Paul and John, and let's not forget that ""Stone'enge was in danger of being crushed by dwarves.""  All this, and some very funny songs like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm Woman"" are merely the icing on the cake as a washed-up band tries repeatedly to make a comeback any way they can.

182199,5,1559408758,"This is the rock documentary film, better than any real documentary that has ever been or ever will be. It's a bit like Withnail and I, where you're primarily watching it for opportunities to get more of that great dialogue, but the musical numbers are wonderful as well, and so are some of the sight gags. But you really just can't get over that understated (and overstated) dialogue. When the drummer spontaneously combusted onstage, ""the authorities agreed it was best left unsolved."" Choked on somebody else's vomit."" Mime is Money. Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal have mime bits, years before either of them made their very big films of the 1980s. Derek Smalls plays a ridiculous double-necked bass guitar. Howard Hessman gets a cameo, he's probably the most famous actor (of the time) in the film. Between Mozart and Bach... Mach. Paul Shaffer plays weird local rep Artie ""Kick My Ass"" Fulkin. ""Puppet show and Sp'n'al Tap"" listed on the billboard.
But the music is wonderful and the boys are great at approximating an energetic classic '70s rock band's stage show, and they fill an audience with extras ready to rock out. Kobe Hall in Tokyo. Nigel playing while wearing a Yomiuri Giants t-shirt. All classic stuff.

The extras are extensive, and there are more minutes of material than there are in the entire official film (culled from ""dozens of hours"" of footage filmed at the time). One of the featurettes is ""Catching up with Marty DiBergi."" Marty and Sp'n'al Tap fighting. He didn't have anything to do with the 18 inch Stonehenge set, and is resentful he can't get more work as a director. ""It's not my fault that Stanley Kubrick's last film was bad. Don't hold that against me. And I'm not as old as Stanley Kubrick."" The ""Rare Outtakes"" section includes over an hour of stuff, including more Billy Crystal mime segment stuff, together with some Dana Carvey and Bruce Kirby in some interesting scenes. The peculiar thing about the Sp'n'al Tap movie is that there's lots of rock `n' roll, but there's very little sex and drugs; the outtakes remedies some of that, and there's a scene when they get conservative Sinatra-loving (""Rock and roll... this is just a fad"") limo driver Tony, played by Bruno Kirby, gets quite zoinked, to the point where he's dancing around in his undies singing Sinatra. Enter the plaster casters... except they cast buttocks. Paul Shaffer smashes an egg on his forehead. Drummer demonstrates his encyclopedic knowledge of baseball in a very funny skit about a radio show where a caller-in poses the typical redundant question (hey, I can relate - I've been there). The actors are actually good musicians - in one musical scene, Michael McKean is fretting a guitar whilere Christopher Guest is picking it - two musical hearts beating as one (it's like Lips and Robb of Anvil many years later). Great! At the Flower People press conference, when asked what they think about free love, the say it's too expensive. In the ""Hell Hole"" video, a skeleton arm sweeps over a doll set of the band on stage. Howard Hessman's character produced music for Smegma Records.

In this case, I watched the film a second time with the commentary running, which is provided by the three main actors, so it's more like a Beavis and Butthead-type commentary than the usual director-discusses-his-choice-of-camera-angles type of commentary, and the guys who play Sp'n'al Tap members David St Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel and Derek Smalls remain in character throughout. Rob Reiner, the director, who plays Marty DiBergi, is not present, so the other three use the occasion to take potshots at him, and make the usual claim that he showed the band in an unglamorous light on most occasions, ha ha ha.

More Sp'n'al Tap songs and albums: ""Big Bottom"", ""Intravenus de Milo"", ""The Gospel According to Sp'n'al Tap"", ""Shark Sandwich,"" ""The Sun Never Sweats"", ""The Incredible Flight of Icarus T Bottom"", ""Blood To Let"", ""Brainhammer!"", ""Bent For The Rent"", ""(Tonight I'm Gonna) Rock You Tonight"", ""Rainy Day Sun"", ""Nice `n' Stinky"".

Great dialogue:

- ""We were called The Originals. But there was another band in the East End called The Originals, so we became the New Originals. And then when that band broke up we considered going back to being called The Originals again.""
- ""We've got armadillos in our trousers, and they run screaming.""
- ""There's such a fine line between stupid and clever.""
- ""It is an endless party, we just don't get invited to it all the time.""
- ""I could hold my own with a gorilla. I read that they can say a few words. They can talk, but they can't swear.""
- ""Water's a drug. Water on your face in the morning is the strongest drug.""
- ""We toured the world and elsewhere.""
- ""You can buy or rent those gold records that you put on the wall.""
- ""This rehearsal was filmed at two in the afternoon - who's awake.""
- ""He could have been killed - missed opportunity.""
- ""Her smoothness was over come by her stridency.""
- ""It feels very fake. Well, not really fake, but false.""
- ""They don't choose to show the enjoyment, only the dismay. The de-joyment.""
- ""When they say the camera doesn't lie - they lie; it's the champion lie of all time.""

First there I about another movie's worth of deleted scenes, some of which are not in any other version.  For instance, the section about the opening act is hilarious.  The commentary was actually serious, as the special edition has the guys back in character, which is just as funny.  But it was interesting o get the real scoop on how it was made, as this is an interesting process since there was a lot of ad libbing.  And, since it such an interesting movie that people will actually like, Criterion, of course, no longer has it available.  The biggest complaint I have with Criterion is that they seem to find the absolutely least commercially interesting movies and use them.  These tend to be movies that only film students will love, and yet they advertise that they are key movies in cinema history.  While they have every single Truffaut, Cassavetes and Kurosawa movie, they have nothing by Spielberg, one by Scorceses, and two by Kubrick.  All none of heir great films.

182203,2,1559408758,"Comedies in general are a strange lot; they rarely if ever retain their comedic value over time as they age poorly being mostly a sendup or a reflection of the times they were made.  There are countless comedies that literally made me roll on the floor with laughter but after subsequent viewings years later barely raised a chuckle out of me.  Thankfully there are a few truly classic films from the genre that still retain or even exceed their comedic value over time but these are few and far between.  ""This Is Spinal Tap"" though especially for those who are musicians or who follow the 80s rock scene closely never fails to amuse and this is mostly due to the excellent performances of Guest, McKean, Shearer and even director Reiner who is an excellent comedic actor in his own right.  It was also nice to see Fran Drescher putting in a great performance before she achieved worldwide fame as ""The Nanny"".

Too bad this blu ray release doesn't live up to the quality of its content; the picture quality can be described as only slightly better than standard dvd in too many frames and I have many standard DVDs that look better.  There are two discs but the content on the second disc barely reaches 15 minutes in length suggesting they could have just put everything on one disc or they could have added more and better Special Feature documentaries on the second disc.  Sadly we get neither here.  The sound quality on DTS HD MA 5.1 surround sound is good except for the very irritating fact that when the band plays, the sound level goes up so high but it goes back down again when the dialogue resumes which is very bothersome when you find you have to quickly adjust the volume whenever this transition is made.

Many fans already have this film in various guises i.e. VHS, DVD, LD etc and so MGM/Fox have to ask themselves what would make fans want to double dip?  As this release is only a slight if I am being generous improvement to the DVD release I am left extremely disappointed and I now wish I had waited for a worthier blu ray release before double dipping.  How about a digibook with much better restored picture quality and a better adjusted sound volume levels for both the music and dialogue parts?  This is not the first Studio Canal release that is subpar and I guess I should have known better instead of taking a chance on this release given how poorly other Studio Canal blu ray releases have been in the past e.g. Kurosawa's ""Ran"".

This is a great comedy that is still very funny today and will probably still be so for years to come but if you already have this on dvd it is not worth the double dip.

Nobody should deprive themselves of the GIFT OF OWNING this uniquely brilliant movie.  My two stars in no way refer to the film itself, it, the movie per se, deserves a galaxy's worth.

The 3 geniuses comprising the original fictional band, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean....have performed on tour in character as well as unwigged, as themselves.  Often with rock's greatest luminaries sitting in, and, I am sure, with a great sense of privilege and joy.

They continue to write & perform incredible music while also pursuing their other unique individual creative  endeavors.

And had it not been for some neat to see deleted scenes and some fun to catch pseudo videos of our fav tracks from the movie....I would have given this edition one star not two.

My intense disappointment---given I got the Criterion DVD mainly for the bonus material which I had never seen---was that the commentary track was done by the principals in character.

OMG, Noooooooooooo!

Am I the only rabid devote of this staggeringly fabulous movie starved for a commentary track by these guys as themselves,  bringing us accurate, esoteric, even arcane  data & insights re, in this case,  an often atypical, sometimes  improvised with flawless instincts... creative process ...and its genesis and unfolding??  (Breathe.)

The only besotted fan starved for a detailed account of actual events.... not by the endearingly self deluded,  adorably moronic, self important but musically gifted individuals these guys played.....but as the full on, uncommon geniuses they ARE????

Being an optimist....I salivate (well, kinda) anticipating the arrival of a new edition including the above commentary track.  I care far less about form including HD/bluray, etc....than I do about CONTENT.

One thing's for sure....if they went there, and for God's sake why wouldn't they???.....THAT edition would sell a bazillion units in record time.",1285459200,2,2179,5.309941520467836

182211,4,1559408758,"""Spinal Tap"" is right-on satire of a wacky 1980's heavy metal band.  The story is weird but you have the gut feeling it is a perceptive lampoon of what was going on in the 80's rock gigs.  Rob Reiner plays Director Marty DiBergi and effectively keeps the story line focused.  Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer are fantastic as they keep their characters real and slightly off regular logic.  Of course we have to remember we are visiting a different universe for the British Heavy Metal Band.

The movie was somewhat sad in that the meaning of success for men in their 40's is to act forever young - not quite adults being shuttled from town to town giving bizarrely ludicrous interviews. Spinal Tap is full of inside jokes for those in the music industry, as well as a vicarious look into the lives of a rock band for the average ""Joe"" and wannabees.

Overall, ""Spinal Tap"" was fun to watch and the dysfunctional group hit every rock star cliche.",1274227200,,966,4.619883040935672

I have the criterion collection version on DVD so I didn't really want to waste any money buying yet another copy that is only marginally better in picture. However, this version is a LOT better. Highly recommend if you're a fan. I did manage to find it for under $13 though on sale at a major big box store this week which is a stellar deal.

They even mocked the big loudest amps and the stupid vintage instrument craze. Indeed, if a guitar can no longer be considered 'true vintage' if the tuners have been replaced, then how can it be considered vintage if the original strings and tags aren't on anymore? Hilarious.

182219,2,1559408758,"I am a huge Tap fan, and when I heard that the Blu-Ray version was to include the commentary from the Criterion Collection version, I eagerly paid early to get on the waiting list for this release. After waiting several months for the Blu-Ray, I realize it's been a waste. The Blu-Ray DOES NOT contain that commentary; rather, it is the same (albeit hilarious) commentary from the special edition DVD release from a few years ago. The only new material is a concert video for Stonehenge (trying lamely to recreate, or maybe reboot, the scene from the mockumentary...it doesn't work), and a series of brief interview clips of Nigel Tufnel discussing Stonehenge (the monument) in connection with a recent special on National Geographic. This is painfully bad, as Guest acts hostile and arrogant, completely out of character from his childlike and enthusiastic portrayal of Tufnel in the film. So, about 30 minutes of poor extra material is dropped onto an extra disc, to give you the impression that this is special material. Otherwise, all the bonus features, etc. from the DVD are here. Don't expect a better picture, either, since the film grain and age of the film are quite apparent.",1248912000,26,1186,4.9054726368159205

The full DVD is what really does, and I'm talking about the special features.  Deleted scenes, fictional character commentary, and a new interview with the fictional characters.  The idea the commentary expresses mainly is that the film showed ninety minutes of mess-ups out of hours and hours of footage.  There are also a lot of funny bits in the commentary, and there are a lot of funny features.  However, the best part of it is definitely the movie itself.  Every musician has at least one embarrassing moment on stage.  Mine was I plugged my guitar in and started rocking out, but I couldn't hear any sound, and suddenly I realized, the amp was on standby.  That's just one moment for me, but technical difficulties with the visual, a blunder in mapping out a set design, getting lost on the way to a stage, and several other moments are what make this film such a classic.  This was also probably the first time when anyone publicly expressed to such a large audience the idea of turning the volume up to eleven.

DeBergi clearly knows nothing about music, and its sad watching him struggle to understand Nigel's technical explanantion of his (then) cutting edge amps. The only reason to recommend this is for the music, which even DeBergi's editors couldn't ruin.

182225,5,1559408758,"I've been a fan of Spinal Tap since they went under the name of The (New) Originals. After the tragic gardening death of their first drummer, John ""Stumpy"" Pepys, Tap tapped Eric ""Stumpy Joe"" Childs to fill the fills and thus began their journey of reputation as England's loudest band. I remember when they opened for Deep Purple in 1972, Ritchie Blackmore, watching backstage, was so intimidated by them that he locked himself in a bathroom for the rest of the night and his band had to soldier on playing a two hour show without him. Spinal Tap were kicked off the bill after one gig.

While I thought Brainhammer and Nerve Damage provided Spinal Tap adequate ""practice"" to become a full-fledged heavy metal outfit, they really came into their own with the release of Blood To Let. I remember my buddy bringing his new Master Of Reality LP over to my house one day and I laughed at Sabbath's feeble attempt at heaviness. I took his silly record off the turntable, broke it in half, plunked Blood To Let down in it's place and watched as his head exploded all over my mom's new sofa after hearing the first two chords of the title track. It was a glorious time to be a Tapper.

Unfortunately, tragedy again struck the band two years later when Stumpy Joe died by choking on his own vomit. Worst of all was the release of the lightweight Intravenus de Milo. THIS was their follow-up to the heaviest record of all time (at the time)?! Their pretentious nonsense kicked up a few more notches with the release of The Gospel According To Spinal Tap, which is still cited as one of the worst mistakes a rock band has ever made. I was officially over this band by 1975.

Years later, in '82, I saw Judas Priest on tour and Spinal Tap happened to be opening for them. The band that once blew Deep Purple off the stage was now greeted with boos and jeers from a hostile crowd growing more impatient by the second for their Metal Gods to come out and show them how it's really done. Then, something amazing happened. Spinal Tap started playing a song. Only this time, it wasn't weak. It was actually pretty good. No, it was GREAT! The song they played was the first single off their new LP Smell The Glove entitled ""Hell Hole."" This song was so awesome that the crowd's cheers drowned the amps out before the second chorus. Spinal Tap played for another 45 minutes or so, but I couldn't even tell what the other songs were because of all the crowd noise. It was Beatlemania all over again. The next day, the Hell Hole single had pushed 427 units. Wow.

But it still wasn't enough for Spinal Tap. Little did we the audience know, filmmaker Marty DiBergi had filmed the whole performance as part of his documentary on the band. Two years later, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" was released and the band's new album shot to #58 on the Billboard Chart. Spinal Tap were finally back. They'd earned their spot as the 58th most popular heavy metal band that week.

Watching this film taught me the secret of being sort of successful. When I got home from my first screening, I immediately wrote the number eleven on my amp and I could HEAR myself actually playing LOUDER!! Nobody else could, but that's because they're stupid. It's such a fine line between clever and stupid, as a wise sage once said.",1240617600,8,3275,4.488255033557047

Following the band on their first U.S. tour in over five years, Dibergi goes where no other filmmaker has gone before - deep inside Tap's history, exploring the lean years (""Gimmie Some Money""), the innocent years (""Cups and Cakes""), the psychedelic years (""(Listen to the) Flower People""), the monolith years (""Stonehenge"") and the then-present years (""Hell Hole"") - while paying respect to all the fallen drummers (R.I.P.) in-between.

Well, some twentysomething years later, I now have the Special Edition of THIS IS SPINAL TAP.  Better late than never, as they say; was it ever worth the wait.

Tongue-in-cheek parody is comic gold when done well; and this spoof of the heavy metal hair bands of the Eighties simultaneously pokes fun at the genre while paying reverent homage.  (Heck, the actors even play their own gigs and songs.)  An alleged ""documentary"", brought to us by legendary (in his own mind) producer/director Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner, who did indeed direct the film), THIS IS SPINAL TAP tells the story of England's ""loudest"" rock band--and of its three core members:  lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest); co-lead guitarist and vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean); and heavily-moustached bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer, whose poorly-played rifts are hysterical).  The band is in America on tour to promote its latest album (""Smell The Glove""); over the course of this tour Murphy's Law reigns supreme, to the detriment of the band--and to the delight of the viewer.

From Guest's outlandish lead solos, to McKean's horrific lyrics, to the actors' over-the-top Manchester accents, to ""flashbacks"" depicting the 18-year history of the band (and its 37 drummers, all victims of bizarre accidents), this ""rockumentary"" is hard core comedic bliss.  All the scenes are improvved; how the actors got through them with straight faces beats the stuffings out of me.  (I'm still in stitches over the scene where the band gets lost trying to find the stage from the dressing room.)  Oh, and look for brief appearances by the likes of Bruno Kirby, Ed Begley, Jr., and Billy Crystal.  Yet after the movie's over, it gets even better. . .

Special features.  This Special Edition includes numerous outtakes (some entertaining, some not so entertaining), some ""music videos"", some ""commercials"", the theatrical trailers, and a special commentary that puts the proverbial cherry on this sundae.  Voiced over by Guest, McKean, and Shearer, the actors reprise their roles as Nigel, David, and Derek, and comment about the film expressing righteous indignation over the ""hatchet job"" director DiBergi did about their beloved band.  Their ad libbed voice-overs, from scene to scene, are just as entertaining as the film itself, making THIS IS SPINAL TAP a crowning comedic experience.

182234,5,1559408758,"I'd give Tap eleven stars if I could. I'd rate my purchase from Amazon Marketplace (from chinaski77) that high as well. Be sure to know exactly what the seller of this rarer version is ready to give you for your money. Fortunately, I got the best deal I could have imagined. My copy looks like it's missing only the original shrinkwrap. The price I paid is not much more than the original price that Criterion lists. As superior as this version is to the ""Special Edition,"" it's not worth being snookered into paying $100+ for it. Shop with vigilence as much as with ""confidence.""

Now for the movie. Nothing more to say about Spinal Tap than has already been regurgitated for almost 25 years. You either revere it or don't get it.

As for the difference between Criterion's version and the recent ""Special Edition,"" the former includes a terrific commentary track by director Rob Reiner and his production crew, and an equally great one by actors Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Sheerer. These commentaries go a long way toward giving viewers insight into the creative process gone through to make such a complex comedy. The latter DVD release contains neither of those tracks. Instead it replaces them with one done by the actors in character: Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins and Derek Smalls commenting on ""rockumentary"" director Marty DiBergi's portrayal of them. The mock track did nothing special for my viewing experience.

More simply put, if Tap is on your must-have list, the Criterion Collection's release is the one to buy. Finding a rental is very difficult.",1218326400,,1583,4.899253731343284

In addition there are many cameos by some of Hollywoods funniest stars.

The disc that I viewed is the MGM Special Edition and it does not disappoint. In addition to a new digital transfer of the film we get the presentation in Dolby 5.1 which adds a lot to the ""heavy metal"" concert footage.

182239,5,1559408758,"Outrageous, wild and intense fun. The best comedy i own is also the best mockumentary and the best ""cult"" classic in my collection, all in one. My devotion for this masterpiece is so great, that i can't help to rejoice in every view, over the misadventures of the intellectually challenged, charming, goofy and charismatic members of the Cult British heavy metal band, legendary ""Spinal Tap"". Actually, and i don't know why, it gets funnier after every show. Amazing! After years of intense exposure to this movie, my emotions still run faster and higher than ever.

In 1982, TV commercial director Marty Dibergi (Director Rob Reiner) is filming the first U.S. tour in years of the cult band Spinal Tap, featuring David St Hubbins (Michael Mc Kean)in guitar, Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) also in guitar, and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) on bass guitar, for the promotion of their new album ""Smell the glove"". Witness the most goofy and entertaining way in wich a tour goes down, when all possible things that can go wrong, got worst. Please watch the interviews with their stories and ""insightful"" opinions, their history (From a R&B skiffle band to psychedelic hippies), the discography (""intravenous de Milo"", ""Shark Sandwich""), the disastrous live performances, the song lyrics and music, the problems with their neurotic manager Ian Faith (Tony Henpra), David's girlfriend tryin to take over the band, and the outrageous issues with publicity and disc Company (promotions and the new LP cover). The most amazing thing, the cast actually composed and recorded the soundtrack on studio, so they actually ""rock"" their instruments. Check the early 80's aesthetics in heavy metal, the costumes, the stage designs, the music and lyrics! Totally absent minded and sexualy liberated!

This is a non stop ""trip"" over a decaying, going-nowhere group of misfits, and we can laugh with the band and at the band. This improvised free style circus got all the elements to crack your jaw out of pure laughter. Elegant, well balanced and masterful conception, and definetly not a fart or pie-in-face comedy, the ultimate mockumentary rocked even the heavy metal world, wich at first thought the band existed (!). The most hylarious experience of my life without a doubt, came out of the absurdities of the world of the music industry, the stage rehearsals, the backstage and the lockers room of a traveling band going down the drain. What a masterpiece, what a concept, such originality and genious all over the place and in every single aspect. Flawless, this is a 5 star Icon in film history, and beyond any known 80's or 90's comedy untill today. Only Coen brothers ""Raising Arizona"" could pull me out of these hypnotic sequences of hilarious disasters. Rob reiner's (the princess bride, stand by me, when harry met sally) best work, absolutely genious, high artistic quality gem.

The MGM 2000 DVD edition, wich i own, may not be perfect in sound and picture quality, but is THE edition: All the available possible material about Spinal Tap is included, Over an hour of deleted scenes enough to make another paralel movie, Tv spots, interviews, gags, music videos... 80 % of the actual DVD disc capacity is used on extras! What can i say!

The DVD menu presentation is Hilarious with the reunited cast playing the band's characters, and the cast and director commentaries based on the same are simply a bonus comedy of its own, simply out of this world, incredible. What a movie, what an edition!

182249,5,1559408758,"I'm a huge metal fan. Whether hair metal, old school, nu metal, alt-metal, prog metal or death metal, I like 'em all. We're talking Slipknot, Iron Maiden, Korn, Poison, Nirvana, Tool, Anthrax, System of a Down, Savatage, Alice In Chains, Faith No More, Lamb of God, Queensryche, Sepultura, Shockplate and many more. And with that enjoyment of heavy metal comes an appreciation of the greatest rock satire of all-time:

""This Is Spinal Tap.""

Directed by Rob Reiner (""When Harry Met Sally"") -- who also doubles as budding documentarian Marty DiBergi -- this mockumentary follows the floundering career of the once-great Spinal Tap. Led by guitarist/vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), guitarist/vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), the Tap is ready to embark on what will surely be a hugely successful tour in support of their new album.

Alas, a variety of dastardly forces unite to ruin Spinal Tap's big tour, from meddling record execs to politically correct organizations to women who, well, are just frightened of the band because they have armadillos in their trousers. Infighting within the band, a mysterious Yoko Ono-esque character, and the band's inability to make it from the dressing room to the stage without getting lost don't help the cause, either. Can the band overcome hardship and rekindle their former glory, or will they be stuck playing barmitzvahs?

Despite a lean running time of 82 minutes, This Is Spinal Tap manages to lampoon an impressive number of rock and metal cliches. The result is a plethora of classic scenes and one-liners, such as when Spinal Tap's guitarist shows off his amps to director Marty DiBergi, and brags about how it's so loud it ""goes to 11."" When DiBergi asks why he just doesn't make 10 louder, the guitarist looks puzzled for a moment before offering his deadpan response: ""This one goes to 11.""

The film is also filled with live performances of such Spinal Tap classics as ""Big Bottom,"" ""Hell Hole,"" and ""Sex Farm."" Each is as hilarious as its title would suggest and does a great job of skewering the big dumb sex mentality of many hard rock bands.

Despite its greatness, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" does suffer a bit from the fact that it pre-dated the heyday of the hair metal explosion, which could have lent itself to some more good gags that seem to be missing from the film. And some of the jokes here have copied so many times they probably don't seem as fresh as they did more than 20 years ago. But considering, for example,that Spinal Tap's ""black"" album pre-dated Metallica's by seven years, it's hard to complain too much.

""This Is Spinal Tap"" rewards repeat viewings, as it delivers as much subtle humor as in-your-face laughs. Keep an eye out for cameos by stars such as Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby and Dana Carvey. The Special Edition DVD, boasting a hilarious intro, incredibly funny commentary track, and hours of solid deleted scenes, is a must-watch. Whether you're a rock or heavy metal fan -- or even if you hate these genres -- you'll get a kick out of ""This Is Spinal Tap.""",1179878400,,3102,4.863636363636363
182250,5,1559408758,"One of the funniest movies ever made ! I won't add to the product descriptions,plenty of reviews for that. But I will add some observations.

  I've lived in Austin,Tx ,""The Live Music Capitol of the World"" ,for the past 30 years, & have known many in the music scene .And no one loves this movie more than the musicians that it skewers. Especially the metal acts . If you ever want to crack one of them up,drop a line from Spinal Tap .Everyone will end up quoting their own favorite line. The smart ones see the joke/danger. The others don't make it and/or end up as jokes themselves.

  Second thing is,the ""in character""voice commentaries alone are worth the  price for any fan wondering why to buy this edition. It is just as brilliant in concept as the movie itself.

  Third thing. Spinal Tap was obviously based on several bands and an entire genre to a degree. But my favorite candidate for ""most based on"" is the '70's band Uriah Heep. They were famous for changing drummers,even changing in mid-album once. I'm a child of the 70's and still listen to them occasionaly. But now I can't keep the grin off my face & keep thinking of that thin,fine line between stupid & clever. Long live Rock 'N Roll !!",1179792000,3,1210,4.4840182648401825

And hilariously so!",1175990400,2,372,4.328571428571428
182253,5,1559408758,"Ever since first seeing ""This is Spinal Tap"" in the theater when it was released, this has been my favorite movie. I have no idea how many times I have seen this film, but every viewing makes me love it more. This is the film that brought the phrase ""mocumentary"" into common use, and while there are many imitators, there is nothing that can rival ""Tap"" in the comedy, satire, or faux-documentary genres.

The film is hosted by director Marti DeBergi, played to perfection by Rob Reiner, and follows the career of the legendary rock group ""Spinal Tap"" as they come apart at the seams during their ""Smell the Glove"" tour. The core of the band are David St. Hubbins (""he was the Patron Saint of Quality Footwear"" and is played by Michael McKean,) Nigel Tufnel (who plays his lead guitar with a violin and is played by Christopher Guest,) and Derek Smalls (who is taunted by a cucumber and an onstage pod, and is played by Harry Shearer.) These three along with Reiner wrote the songs for the film, and, yes, Tap does play their own instruments.

The film skewers every part of the pop music business through wonderful period flashbacks and hysterical situations that unfold during the course of the tour. The tour is a disaster, ranging from a Stonehenge triptych that is ""in danger of being crushed by a dwarf,"" the perpetual loss of drummers (""he died in a bizarre gardening accident,"" ""he choked on vomit...someone else's vomit actually...there's no real way to dust for vomit...,"") to the resignation of the band's longtime manager Ian Faith (wonderfully played by Tony Hendra) with managerial duties being picked up by David's loathsome girlfriend Jeanine Pettibone, who ""dresses like an Australian's nightmare."" The film also features great cameos from luminaries such as Billy Crystal (""mime is money,"") Bruno Kirby (""Spinal Pap,"") and Howard Hesseman as rock star Duke Fame (""I'd love to stay and talk, but I have to go sit in the lobby and wait for the limo."")

The plot thickens when things unravel at a gig on an Air Force base, and ""Spinal Tap, Mark II"" briefly appears in a free-form jazz odyssey at an amusement park (""Derek Smalls on bass...he wrote this...""): the marquee reads ""Puppet Show and Spinal Tap""...but at least their dressing rooms are bigger than the puppet's. An eventual tour of Japan resolves a number of plot loose ends, although they do lose another drummer in a mysterious green explosion.

In sum: this is the perfect movie. It became my favorite the first time I saw it on the big screen, and through many, many subsequent viewings it has managed to retain that status. If you enjoy sly and satirical humor, this movie is not to be missed, but be forewarned: you will not absorb all the jokes the first time, so mentally prepare yourself for the repeat viewings that will surely follow.",1175644800,8,2821,4.762781186094069

The result is genius and not to be missed.

Of course the DVD comes along with the standard hilarious extra footage, an interview with director Rob Reiner, trailers, music videos, and more. But, the part that's worth it all, and the part that will keep you rolling with laughter throughout, is the Audio Commentary by Spinal Tap.

When I first selected the Audio Commentary, I expected to hear  Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer (the actors who make up the band Spinal Tap) talking about what they had to do for each scene. Instead, I found myself doubled over with laughter as all three actors give their commentary IN CHARACTER! If the movie was funny, the movie with commentary from the actors in character is hysterical! You hear the guys reflecting on people they meet in the movie, making excuses for mistakes they made, and more and it all serves to make the movie that much more funny and worth watching/owning.

182262,5,1559408758,"It's rare for me to outright keep loving comedies. The problem with them is that once you've gotten the joke, it either does make you laugh but not as much as the first time or simply no laugh at all. Somehow though, this film manages to be funny even if you've seen it several times. Staged as a ""rockumentary"" about a fictional band, the film manages to be hilarious, filled with good drama and even some social commentary. This is probably Rob Reiner's finest and just one of comedy's better film outings.

The film follows Martin DiBergi(Reiner) documenting the British group Spinal Tap as they're about tour the US in support of their new album ""Smell the Glove"". Members David, Nigel and Derek find that touring has its share bit of problems from lack of promotion, cancelled shows, problems with artwork and many other problems. Of course it doesn't help the members are either ridiculously genius or smartly stupid.

There's so many classic moments that it's hard to pinpoint the most hilarious. Whether it's Derek's comment about his role as lukewarm water, Nigel's vulgar title for a beautiful piano piece or the infamous Stonehedge scene, it's one of those kind of films where it's best if you just watch it and laugh rather than explaining the jokes since it wouldn't be as funny. The film was largely improv'd and it allows the film to have a more brisker pacing and jokes come easier rather than peppering the film with comedic moments at certain points.

The highlight of the special features is the ""band commentary"" where actors Michael McKean(David), Christopher Guest(Nigel) and Harry Shearer(Derek) supply commentary in character about the film. While it does get old since they essentially derail everything in the film but some is just hilarious. I'm particularly fond of the start-up menu before the film logo where one says of a black screen ""it's like space without the stars"" and the other goes ""that's really quite poetic, man"".

Whereas the Princess Bride was more whimsical and even ""magical"", Spinal Tap is just simply funny and even insightful.",1168041600,,2075,4.92

182266,5,1559408758,"""This Is Spinal Tap"" has to stand as one of the greatest parodies ever produced.  To me, there is nothing about this movie that misses, and it is one of those rare movies that actually caused me to fall of my seat because I was laughing so hard (during the Stonehenge scene).  Ostensibly a documentary, or a ""rockumentary"" as Rob Reiner's Marty DeBergi says, it is a portrayal of Spinal Tap's implosion and rebirth by quickly moving from one gag to another.  Anyone who loves and follows heavy metal music, especially the new wave of British heavy metal movement (Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, etc.), will appreciate how well Spinal Tap skewers the stereotypes.  Those gags come rapid-fire, from stage prop malfunctions to songs heavy on arcane mythological imagery to inter-band feuds.  The earlier heavy metal acts are also not spared, such as in Christopher Guest's absolutely hysterical send-up of a Jimmy Page guitar solo.  Throw in some oblique references to even the most venerable acts in music, such as the Beatles, and you have a movie that pulls off the rare feat of being incredibly silly, bitingly witty, critical of heavy metal music, and paying tribute to the genre all at the same time.  I've seen Spinal Tap's formula copied many times since, but never with the same effect or quality.  This truly is the archetype for mockumentary parodies. As with most DVD's, this is packed with lots of extras.  The commentary by the principles, who stay in character, is a treat, as are the song videos, fake commercials, trailers, etc.",1164672000,3,1538,4.862068965517241

Every aspect of `60s and `70s rock music is lampooned.  Surprisingly, director/interviewer Rob Reiner comes off a little flat--but maybe that's just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters.  ""Big Bottom"" (a sendup of ""Fat Bottomed Girls""--one of my politically incorrect favorites), the ""sophisticated"" ""Sex Farm"", and the controversial ""Smell the Glove"" (ultimately released as Tap's ""Black Album"") are among ""Tap's"" big hits.",1163462400,2,663,5.355769230769231

Almost every serious Rock fan and rock star must have seen this movie or if they haven't, they had better see it before they go out and give another interview. Believe me, there are bands and performers who still talk and give interviews like Spinal Tap did in this movie. This movie is made for these guys. Like me, if you have watched countless interviews of rockstars, popstars and movie stars you cannot do without this classic. The Lead guitarist was my favourite. I could give him an Oscar for his brilliant performance. If Jimmy Page used a bow on his guitar you must wait and see what the lead guitarist of  Spinal Tap does.

These guys literally become Gods by the way they poke fun at Rockstars and their mannerisms particularly when it comes to giving interviews and playing live. In fact this movie is so well made that it puts to shame serious rockumentaries made for real rockstars and bands.

One of the most famous lines from the movie apart from ""This one goes to 11"" is when the band is asked about one of their deceased members for which the band mates tell the interviewer (played by the director Rob Reiner himself) that the bandmate died of choking on vomit but they didn't know whose vomit!  Hilarious and highly entertaining you'll love this DVD with tons of goodies which are worth the price of the DVD alone. There is so much extra footage on the DVD that is seems like Spinal Tap 2.

The extras are as good as the original movie. I couldn't stop laughing when the band goes to the zoo and near the chimps cage when they are talking their usual ridiculous lines they say things like ""'..chimps can't talk but can use computers.."" and stuff. You wonder how brilliantly the actors have come together to pull off something like this.

Filled with a host of comedic talent, there's much to laugh at in this film, but one of its great strengths (and what sets it apart from the team's later mockumentaries such as Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show) is that it is never too absurd to be believed. The characters in this film are absolutely believable and the situations they get themselves in are, too (like the stage malfunctions, and the cancelled bookings).

182282,4,1559408758,"Rarely do I come across a movie as funny and original as This Is Spinal Tap. Ed Begley Jr is an absolute genius. His unique method of creating this fictional documentary - or rather -""rockumentary"" that contains hilariously realistic interviews, is truly one of the kind. Once again, Christopher Guest manages to pull off his character with perfection, within every small detail of his performance. Along with Guest, all of the other characters are equally great to watch, and of course the outrageous hairstyles and skintight costumes make a huge plus. Spinal Tap's depiction of typical 80's British rock bands also comes off as quite accurate, and the film enables audiences to take a look at the peculiar but funny culture of hard-core rock n' roll. To top it all off, the songs that are performed will not only make you laugh, but are also catchy enough for you to find them stuck in your head. Although Spinal Tap might seem to lack a real plot, if you truly appreciate good movies, this is one film that you will not want to miss. Cleverly spontaneous and quirky, This Is Spinal Tap is definitely a classic.",1149033600,2,1113,4.712820512820513
182283,4,1559408758,"""This Is Spinal Tap"" is a fun satire.  It is as obvious as it is freewheeling, but it hits its bullseye and never stops.  Rob Reiner, who directed and was contributing writer to this extravaganza, plays the interviewer making a ""Rockumentary"" of the title named band from England.  The disparity between the interviews and the behind the scenes debacles is telling.  Mercilessly, the contradictions poke fun at the pretenses and the self-importance of a successful band hitting the skids.  There are also occasional flashbacks to earlier incarnations of the group and its music that parody different movements in rock history.  The songs, especially the lyrics, nail the music on its head.  ""...Spinal Tap"" does for heavy metal what ""Nashville"" does for country, except the songs are far better here.

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, so we're seldom beat over the head, but it isn't breezy, either.  ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is an infectious parody of heavy metal bands and a fun movie that makes it all seem so easy.",1149033600,,1026,4.953216374269005
182284,5,1559408758,"The only thing funnier than `This Is Spinal Tap' is the people who didn't get the joke. Leafing through the reviews on Amazon and IMDB, I came upon a couple of one star reviews along the lines of `it was an okay documentary but why make a film about this band nobody's heard of when there were lots of better bands around?' There was even one guy who, apparently attempting to appear musically educated, stated that he remembers hearing some of Spinal Tap's hits in the 70's, but they were nothing special. The fact that there are a few who failed to realize that Spinal Tap were a fictitious band, created specifically for this mockumentary, is a testament to the subtle intelligence of the humor and the preciseness of the film's parody, as well as to the dreadful overall state of mainstream rock in the late 70's and early 80's.

In his first feature film, Rob `Meathead' Reiner disguises himself as documentary maker Marty DiBergi and follows around the comeback US tour of has-been heavy metal dinosaurs Spinal Tap. Reiner did not invent the fake documentary - and I don't care what Charlie (or was it Donald?) Kaufman says, it wasn't Fellini either - the concept can be traced back to the brilliant opening scene of `Citizen Kane' and even earlier than that - but no film prior to `This Is Spinal Tap' was this loyal and uncompromising in its documentary structure and in its invented reality. Reiner, Guest and co. took the joke to the very limits, and it's easy to see that with the DVD bonus features, which include TV commercials made by Spinal Tap, video clips, press conferences and TV appearances from across the band's history, even an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.

Spinal Tap are everything that was silly, trite and ridiculous about the music industry in the early 80's. In their Prima Dona behavior, their stupid quarrelling, their idiotic, half-baked pseudo-philosophic wisdom, and most of all in their songs, Spinal Tap put a distorting mirror in front of half the bands that were around at the time; and any band that was insulted because they thought the joke was on them, merely proved the point. The songs use every clich&eacute; of rock music without shame, and the performances of Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as the bandmates are precise, merciless and hilarious. Best of all is Guest as virtuoso guitarist Nigel Tuffnel, who is beyond brilliant in several unforgettable scenes (including the classic `the dials go up to eleven' routine), but is also hilarious when he doesn't say a word; his body language and facial expressions while playing on stage spoof any self-proclaimed genius guitarist of the time, and there's no need for mentioning any names.

Again, what makes `This Is Spinal Tap' great is the subtleness of the humor. Reiner and co. felt no inhibition to supply jokes by the minute as way too many comedies do, and it's an ability he proved again later in the classics `The Princess Bride' and `When Harry Met Sally'. The jokes in `This Is Spinal Tap' do not overshadow the characters and the story told, but with very few actual jokes the film is still unbelievably, consistently, laugh-out-loud roll-on-the-floor funny. Especially for musicians and music lovers in general, who will immediately laugh at many of the easy to miss jokes, `This Is Spinal Tap' is essential viewing, and one of the funniest films you'll ever see.

Though, Guest did not direct this mockumentary---or ""rockumentary,"" if you will, he is brilliant, and wrote this film (along with writing the ORIGINAL rock and roll music) with the wonderful team of Michael Mckean, Harry Shearer and director Rob Reiner.  Incidentally, McKean and Shearer went on to appear with Guest on Saturday Night Live, in the early 1980s, as well as ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" (two of the mockumentary/improv trilogies conceptualized by Guest and fellow comedian Eugene Levy).

David St. Hubbins (Michael Mckean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) are the trio that make up the fading British heavy metal band, Spinal Tap, chronicled by filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner), and we watch their journey, as they gradually spiral downward into obscurity.  But, let me tell you, it is one hell of a ride.  You are going to laugh so hard, as the actors manage to retain their overaccentuated British accents, over-the-top rock star eccentricities and belt out songs like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Hell Hole.""  It just goes to show that everyone is entitled to their fifteen minutes of fame (in the words of Andy Warhol).

The same team that made 'Waiting for Guffman' and 'Best in Show' started with this mockumentary about the fictional band Spinal Tap. It's guarenteed to make you laugh, though it's not the real 'here's a joke, now laugh' humor.

This new edition has many special feautures. For starters the menu in the beginning has commentary by the bandmembers which is really funny. Disc 1 also has the entire movie with commentary by the three main band members. Keeping in character however, not really about how the movie was made like so often. It's almost as funny as the movie itself, but best seen late at night after an evening of partying.

Disc 2 is what really makes this DVD worth buying. It has more than an hour worth of outtakes! I don't really get why they took them out because they aren't any less than what ended up in the movie.

It also has some music videos, TV commercials and a hilarious press conference by the Flower People, the band they were in before Spinal Tap. And throughout the entire DVD they keep in character so I wouldn't be surprised if some people who have trouble grasping the concept of irony will still think it's a real band.

A few problems here, first of all the weight class's started at 98# I weighed 88#  when the moon was not full.

  Wrestling requires physical fitness that can not be faked. I was completely confused about the whole game. First of all I was a runt who spent his time goofing off, riding my mini bike, and shooting some hoops. I signed up for this God Awful sport/game/torture and the next thing I know I am running six miles with short little legs that would have equated (if my calculations are correct) to 35 miles.

What did I do to deserve this? I ended up with a perfect record, no wins all loss's... I retired after the first year and to this day am proud of my efforts.

There's no laugh track, there's no winking at the audience, and there's no need; almost every moment is funny.

The writing by Shearer, Reiner, Guest, and McKean is excellent, and extends past the dialogue to the music and lyrics, which are an integral part of the overall humor.

This will always be one of my favorite films and the Criterion DVD has a commentary with the main actors as themselves , whereas the MGM DVD features them in character .

The Criterion DVD also has another commentary track with Rob Reiner on it , plus some of the technical crew .

This has become a rare DVD , but the MGM DVD will do nicely while you're saving up for the Criterion version .

While the portrayal of a hardrock band on it's way down (IF they don't make it in, say Japan, that is...) is hilarious, as a movie the film has a serious flaw. There is virtually no story. It's are not going anywhere (Japan is not counting), it's more a series of funny sketches and songs.

Having said that, there are many many good things in this film. Like when the band sits and listens to reviews that have been written about their albums. How did they come up with all those stupid album titles? They sound just like something a heavy metal band would come up wi... ah, right. ""IntraVenus de Milo"", for example. And of course, ""The Gospel According to Spinal Tap"", that is accompanied by an appropriate review: ""These prentetious Rock Psalms make you wonder on which day the Lord created Spinal Tap, and if He couldn't have rested on that day too."" The band actually appreciates that review.

Great lyrics to all the songs, too. You can tell that the movie makers love hard rock music as they make fun of the clichs. Clumsy lyrics about sex (""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm""), a song about the 'mysterious' Stonehenge, and my personal favourite ""Rock and Roll Creation"" that mixes concepts from different religions with secular origin science and turns it all into a song about... well, Rock and Roll.

""Twas the rock and roll creation

Twas a terrible big bang

Twas the ultimate mutation

Ying was searching for his yang

And he looked and he saw that it was good.""

That's just ingenious.

Still, the problem is that with no overall direction for the story (there is no murder to be solved, no love to be found, and even the album is already recorded) makes the film a little bit tiresome to watch. Possibly the gags would have worked better if presented separated in a TV-show, so you don't get too much of the same at once. In ""The Office"", we have the unhappy love situation (among other things) that ties the show together. Here we have a series of great sketches and songs, that are of course related to each other, but not going anywhere. Oops, I've already said that. See, that's what I mean. It's the same.

182313,5,1559408758,"A documentary made by a filmmaker named Marti DiBergi ( played by Rob Reiner) gives a look into England's loudest heavy metal band called ""Spinal Tap"" on their history from 60's swingers to a rock sensation that has swept both America & England, there is interviews with the band members Nigel Tugnel ( Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins ( Michael McKean) and Derek Smalls ( Harry Shearer) and behind the scenes of their latest album ""Smell the Glove"".

This entertaining and hilarious mockumentary on a fictional non-existent rock band has became a cult sensation and a midnight favorite. There is such originality within the script itself, a self-mocking sense of humor is what helps the comedy of this movie.

Rob Reiner's direction is flawless, there is also appearences by Fran Drescher, Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal makes this one unforgettable cult comedy experience you must not miss.

The special edition is just as great as the movie itself with awesome transfer & great sound quality, the extras are also very good such as audio commentary by Spinal Tap themselves, outtakes, music videos, 6 TV commericals, Trailers, a Fictional but funny Flower People Press Conference, Spinal Tap appearence on "" The Joe Franklin Show"" and "" Heavy Metal Memories"" fake commercial.

182314,5,1559408758,"Though a bit scattershot and predictable at times, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is the definite satire on the big hair, late-70s rock scene. The first time I saw this film, it took me awhile to realize it was a put-on. The performances are so dead-pan, dead-on and sincere, and the ensemble work is so perfect that you forget you are watching a hilarious send-up of a music genre that is already a self-caricature.

The film follows the come-back tour of a band that never was much of anything to begin with. The band members are semi-talented, self-absorbed and self-important. They are oblivious to the fact that a string of cancellations and no-shows at album signings means they are not popular. The band soldiers on, from one tiny venue to another (at one point they are actually second billing to a puppet show), proving that if you can't be better, you can be louder. The film satirizes everything rock: the faux-satanic outer space stage gear; the trouser-bulging, blow-dried and hairy-chested look of the period; pretentious evocations of all things druid; unreflectively and unabashedly sexist album covers and song titles (""Sex Farm Woman"" and ""Lick My Love Pump"" being my favorites). You have your thinning-haired, bevested managers, empty-headed full-chested groupies, manager-wannabe girlfriends, exploding drummers, and much more.

Special kudos to Michael McKean and Christopher Guest for playing the band's ""founders,"" Nigel Tufnel and David St. Hubbins. They are entirely convincing as old school chums who have been rocking for years. Just managing to keep a straight face through this insanity is worthy of an Oscar. A notable mention to Harry Shears, whose leather-and-steel-clad bass player is a preview of a similar turn in ""A Mighty Wind"". Recreations of the band's past as a 60s ""Flower Power"" band are just perfect. The only thing missing (thankfully) is alcohol and drug abuse, which would have ruined the band's (and the film's) loopy innocence.",1101686400,,1965,5.156739811912225
182315,5,1559408758,"This movie, unlike, say, The Decline Of Western Civilization, conveys a realistic portrayal of what it's like to be in a working, touring band.  Admittedly, it goes a bit overboard, but it's still pretty accurate.  This is coming from a working musician who has been playing in front of audiences for over twenty years.

The technical problems - getting lost on the way to the stage, the six-inch Stonehenge monolith (complete with dwarves kicking it around), the wireless receiver picking up air traffic noise, the pod that fails to open - every working musician has had problems like that, although I'm pretty safe in saying that there haven't been too many exploding drummers.  And the arguments between the members of the group are all too familiar to anyone who has picked up a guitar, bass, or drum sticks.

At any rate, this film should be required viewing for anyone who thinks they want to be a musician.  If, after watching it, they still think they can handle it, they should go ahead.  However, I'm sure that more than a few people sat down to watch it and decided afterward not to go to the hock shop and buy that old guitar they were looking at the week before.

All of that said, this is a hysterically funny film.  Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean are amazingly talented comedians, actors, and songwriters.  It's hard not to tap your foot to songs like ""(Tonight) I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight"" or ""Big Bottom"".

The music - unimaginative and boring as is the scriptwriting.

182317,5,1559408758,"is the closest bottomline I can draw for this film. Made in 1984, This is Spinal Tap is a great mockumentary that shows the rise and fall of a great but imaginary band. It represents bands of all times, and no band at all. Anyone who listens to, or has any vague idea of classic Rock 'n' Roll, would see their parody from The Beatles to Ozzy Osburne at some points in the movie. I particularly love the parody with their early song ""Flower People"".

The characters are well-developed and realistic (if you're a rocker you may agree with this more =)). They say funny things and do ridiculous actions. Some of the jokes are real close to hitting ""dumb"" but it gracefully misses. Laughs are inserted everywhere throughout the film, though again, it's better if you know some rock 'n' roll knowledge to get the laughs.

Criterion disc contains an extra of 60-minute cut scenes add alternative ""footage"" and further completes the story with more laughs.

What distinguishes this film from other satires is that it knows it's subject matter in and out and despite the inherent humor of the heavy metal music genre it has affection for it's main characters.  There is so much good stuff here that to give away the surprises would be criminal.  Kudos to Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer for such an ingenious collaboration.  The numerous cameos here (Ed Begley Jr., Billy Crystal, Angelica Huston,etc.) are also a joy to behold.  Tony Hendra as Ian Faith, the cricket-bat wielding manager of the band and June Chadwick as McKean's girlfriend-astrologer also make a major contribution to the film.  Even Rob Reiner as director Marty DiBergi( a sly reference to Martin Scorsese and his rock film, ""The Last Waltz"") adds something to the film.  This was Rob Reiner's directing debut and despite numerous successes(""Stand by Me"", ""When Harry Met Sally"",""A Few Good Men"") he never, in my mind, attained the heights that he reached with this initial effort.  I think the collaboration with Guest(who had subsequent success to a lesser degree with this ""mockumentary"" format), McKean, and Shearer just brought out the best in everybody.

Instead, I will offer you some quotes. Those alone should give you plenty of insight as to why this is one of the greatest movies of all time. To wit:
""Oh, there actually is, uh... there was a Saint Hubbins?""
""That's right, yes.""
""What was he the saint of?""
""He was the patron saint of quality footwear.""

""What do you call this?""
""Well, this piece is called ""Lick My Love Pump"".

""As long as there's, you know, sex and drugs, I can do without the rock and roll.""
""Here lies David St. Hubbins... and why not?""

""Dozens of people spontaneously combust each year. It's just not really widely reported.""
""It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none. None more black.""
""We are Spinal Tap from the UK - you must be the USA!""
""You can't really dust for vomit.""
""This pretentious ponderous collection of religious rock psalms is enough to prompt the question, 'What day did the Lord create Spinal Tap, and couldn't he have rested on that day too?'""
And of course: ""Why don't you just make ten louder and make ten be the top number and make that a little louder?
""These go to eleven.""

182328,3,1559408758,"I'm not giving this film 3 stars as a comedy but actually as a serious film. What??? Well, here's the thing: I watched ""This is Spinal Tap"" in 2004. For whatever reasons i hadn't seen it up until this point, but i can't help it that it seemed dated to me.
  More than probably, back in 1984 when it was released, this thing cut it. It cut it with the frequency of humor it had and with the story it presents. But today? Today, it simply seems dated and even from a historical point of view there could've been a much better result to have come out of it, especially if another (more interesting) band was featured. It's not like there weren't any choices out there, geeez, this is the rock world we're talking about. Motorhead, for one band, would've easily incorporated many of the ""assets"" of Spinal Tap as well as other added ones that would've made the overall product much more attractive and poignant.
  But having said that, Spinal Tap does have its worth and this is where i come to my point: I personally laughed wholeheartedly with only a few scenes in this film, mainly because to me this was hardly a comedy. Now, this is indeed scary, but why would i laugh with something supposedly made to mock when even big bands (no need to mention names) have been 50 times funnier as Tap? Or when i constantly read to this very day daily quotes from the rock gods that make you first re-read the quote with amazement and then burst with laughter realising it's seriously said. Did i say ""serious""? That's exactly it. This film attempts to make something look funny when it's already hilarious to begin with. It tries too much, and often during the film i thought that stretching it was totally un-needed and spoiled the effort.
  I read the official review from Amazon and at the very end of it, it says that this is the best rocumentary ever made. I take up a  serious issue with that assessment folks: Unless one has not seen ""Almost famous"" (came out 4 years ago) would that statement hold sadly true. But Almost Famous is leagues better than Spinal Tap, it's far more poignant, far more accurate, far funnier, far deeper (ok, that wouldn't be too difficult) and it far more captures the times it portrays than Spinal Tap could ever hope to.
  I think that Spinal Tap is still watchable exactly because we know this is real (well, some of us do). Bands like that did exist in much worse form even, and -that's even scarier- they still do today (again, no need to mention names, those with even half a brain know the culprits). If someone wanted to find another Spinal Tap-like band to make a film about today he wouldn't have the slightest problem. Not back then, not now, not in 20 years from now, as pathetic as that sounds for the rock scene. Or for any musical scene for that matter.
  As a movie, ""Spinal Tap"" does well picking on all the rock cliches and their inane shallowness, it does even better representing the average rock farsical god, but it does so without keeping you interested enough, especially if you're not a rock afficionado and you don't ""see"" the references.
  The humor and the punchlines quickly become not so much repetitive but definately predictable, the horrible Tap songs are simply too horrifying to endure, you end up being thankful the 80s are gone and buried, and yet those with a deep knowledge of the scene are left thinking that this is only the tip of the iceberg and that the rest is left untouched in the film.
  All in all, the Tap movie does have its place in musical history (exactly where that place is, I'm not so sure). However, when it comes to films about the surreality of the rock scene things are pretty bleak: there are simply not many films, with the exception of 3-4, that capture that in an adequate way. All i can suggest for the time being is to opt instead for ""Almost Famous"". Encyclopaedically speaking though, ""This is Spinal Tap"" does have its merits...",1086220800,4,3922,4.511988716502116

This movie will particularly appeal to musicians (or those that know and love them), though everyone will enjoy the comedy of this waning band being booked second to a puppet show and doing an act with a Stonehenge set, only to have a miniature Stonehenge descend on stage.
Whether it's Nigel explaining to us that his amps go to 11 or, my personal favorite part, when he starts to solo during a show, using a violin to play his guitar, only to stop and retune the violin, this movie will make you laugh time and time again.

And now that its on DVD in this special edition, you are defintly getting your moneys worth! I was able to get this cheap for $20 Australian, and it was one of the first DVD's i bought, and it was one I have never regreted!
The sound quality is excellent, altho i do remember the guitar beeing a bit fatter in sound on the VHS but it dosent matter. These guys really know how to make this kind of comedy work. They don't try to go for gag after gag and joke after joke, they succeed well with what they do because it's more on the serios side then on the comedy side, and if you wernt aware you where watchign a comedy and knew it was all a gag then you might take the film serios as i know alot of people have! But they just don't understand the brilliant humour of Spinal Tap, and the very clever way it has been presented to make you laugh.
The bonus features are great, there is 2 discs packed full of extra goodies, video clips, interveiws, telivision appearences.... i don't know if the world version comes with them or not? but the Australian one does come with a few commercials that Tap did back in the early 90's for a food product that where called ""Rock 'n rolls"" which where horrible pizza bun things that never lasted, but the commercials where funny enough to watch again on the DVD!
The only thing I wish about this DVD was that they added the interveiw they did on an Australian talk show called ""Tonight live with Steve Vizard"" and there appearence on ""The Simpsons"" but even tho they arnt included, the DVD is still great value for money!

182331,5,1559408758,"""This is Spinal Tap"" is one of the most original, subtle, hilarious movies you will ever see, and offers more great quotes than any film this side of ""Fletch.""
A ""mockumentary,"" ""Tap"" is pure fiction.  But it's fiction that captures some universal truths about the relentless pursuit of a dream, even while the rest of the world is screaming at you to wake up.
Marty DeBergi (Rob Reiner) is ""producing"" this documentary about Spinal Tap, ""one of Europe's loudest bands.""  We see Reiner travel with the band on tour to promote its newest album, ""Smell the Glove,"" and he gets to interview the band at great length -- in no small part because most of their gigs appear to be canceled.
The music, written and performed by actors Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins on lead vocals and guitar), Christopher Guest (lead guitar Nigel Tufnel), and Harry Shearer (bassist Derek Smalls) is a hilarous reprise of various genres of rock and roll, heavy on the power-rock of the '70s (""Sex Farm,"" ""Stonehenge,"" ""Big Bottom""), with a little psychedelic feel-good rock in there too (""Listen to the Flower People"").  One of the best soundtracks ever, these songs skewer the performers as well as those you who were fans of this kind of music when it was big.
The album is released, the tour kicks off, and the wheels begin to fall off.  Many scenes are legendary.  ""Hello Cleveland!"" -- when the band can't find the stage.  ""But these go to eleven"" -- Nigel explains why his amplifiers have more power than the next guys.  ""It's okay, Boston's not a big college town"" -- when the band learns their next gig was canceled.  ""It's a fine line between stupid and clever"" -- debating artistic choices made by the band.  ""Puppet show and Spinal Tap"" -- the sign announcing the band's next gig.  ""Spinal Tap, currently residing in our 'Where are they now?' file"" -- while the band (on tour) listens to the radio play one of their old songs.  And so on and so forth.
If you have the good fortune of knowing a professional musician, ask them about ""Tap.""  Odds are, without saying any more, you're going to see a wide smile and start getting the quotes.  The filmmakers' understanding of (and affection for) life on the road in the music business is eerie.

While Spinal Tap is capable of turning out the occasional catchy tune, it's obvious watching this film that they were/are basically one-trick ponies.  Whether that's the fault of the editor, I can't say.  I will say that viewing this film made me only want the hits (collected on the film's soundtrack) and it did not give me the desire to seek out their earlier work (""Shark Sandwich"" and ""Intravenous De Milo"", both of which seem to be out of print anyway).
I guess my real complaint is with the filmmakers, as I'm wondering why they chose to cover such a little-known group when there were perfectly acceptable alternatives: Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Eddie Money, and/or Motorhead.

182338,5,1559408758,"One of the funniest films of all time, and certainly one of the cleverest, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is as equally hysterical and subtle today as it was twenty years ago, back when Rob Reiner was pretty much known for his iconic role on the television show ""All in the Family"" -- not yet for ""The Princess Bride,"" ""When Harry Met Sally..."", ""A Few Good Men,"" and certainly not for being an excellent director. (Now, by 2004, his films have occupied many of the various AFI lists, including the best romance films and comedies.)
""This is Spinal Tap"" was the first of its kind -- a so-called ""rockumentary"" following the dissipation of a terrible British hard rock band during the mid-80s, with songs like ""Sex Farm"" ample proof of their considerably awful talent.
Tons of bands like Spinal Tap were popular during the 1980s, then soon fell out of the public eye. Not many of them even had much talent at all -- just drugged-out band members and lots of rebellious attitudes as their primary advertising campaign.
Because Spinal Tap is so close to reality, and because it is so ridiculously ironic and yet far-fetched, it has achieved a massive army of fans and even a famed Criterion Collection DVD (now out of print, unfortunately). The film was never exactly a smash at the box office, but its popularity -- like so many famous films -- grew rapidly over the years since its release, having gradual re-releases (the sure-fire sign of a cult film) and lots of fake reunion concerts. (One of which was recently released onto a DVD.)
Legend has it that after the film was released in 1984, people often came up to Rob Reiner on the street and they would say, ""I really liked your movie, but I wish you would have chosen a more popular band to do a film on.""
Yes, Spinal Tap is absolutely false. It's not a real band. But it's hard to tell at times. Some people don't like the film because they find it too real -- but I think that's the whole idea.
As the film fades into focus, we are introduced to Marty DiBergi (Reiner), a documentary film maker who was drawn to Spinal Tap, the UK heavy metal rock band, early on in their career -- he admired their ""loud"" songs and now, at the height of their career, he is setting out to record their private lives that exist behind the stage.
The three main rockers are Nigel (Christopher Guest), David (Michael McKean), and Derek (Harry Shearer), who go around the world on rock tours, inspiring lots of loud noise amongst fans and upsetting a lot of people -- like the limo driver played by Bruno Kirby (""The Godfather Part II"") in a pre-""When Harry Met Sally"" cameo. (Billy Crystal also makes a cameo as a mime waiter in one of the most subtle scenes -- look quick, you might miss him.)
The cast performed all their own songs, as well as writing them. Guest, McKean and Shearer are all gifted musicians -- but they're also pretty funny. Part of what makes this film so effective on repeat viewings is that you're guaranteed to find some things you didn't notice last time. John Hughes once said that he liked to place small background quirks in his films (such as the crawling mice in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"") so that, on repeat viewings on television, someone watching might drift from the main focus of the film to the background of the sequence -- and there's the hidden gag that isn't even all that funny, just...different.
Your first viewing of ""Spinal Tap"" might be less than enthusastic. But I beg of you, watch it again, take a chance to open your ears more, pay attention to small things in the background, and listen to those songs the guys are singing. That's where much of the comedy lies. This is a film that is definitely worth owning for such purposes.
Speaking of hidden elements, much has been said -- or rather implied -- about the homosexuality of Nigel. When David's girlfriend joins them for the tour, his heart sinks because he loves him. I dunno, I've always thought it was because they were childhood friends and Nigel doesn't want anyone to take David away from him for friendship reasons. (Although the line ""We're closer than brothers..."" makes you wonder.)
This mockumentary formula has been re-created time and time again since ""This is Spinal Tap,"" even in films such as ""The Blair Witch Project.""
But the mockumentary style has been mimicked particularly by Guest, who starred in -- and directed -- ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best in Show,"" and most recently, 2003's ""A Mighty Wind."" Michael McKean and Harry Shearer returned for these entries, and I'm thinking that the next film should be a collaborative effort, and should reunite everyone from ""Spinal Tap"" for a 20-year anniversary -- Reiner, Guest, McKean, Shearer, the cast from Guest's mockumentaries, and perhaps even Crystal and Kirby, et al., in cameos. I'm sure more than a few people would go to see it. And, unlike so many other films, it is one that actually deserves a sequel. And probably one that would be just as funny as the first. And one that would have a purpose, other than being just another cash-in. Anyone interested in what happened to the band members twenty years after their downfall? I know I do.
But this is getting off the point, and the point is that none of these Guest mockumentaries -- as good as they are -- come close to the pure greatness of ""This is Spinal Tap,"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" -- although funny -- started to show signs of formula aging. But ""This is Spinal Tap"" was, is, and always shall be, the granddaddy of the mockumentaries. It's the ""Psycho"" of mockumentaries, and actually a lot of ""regular"" comedies, too.",1073520000,,5585,4.625377643504532
182339,5,1559408758,"I know this sounds trite, but this DVD truly goes to eleven...
Ever since the Beatles came to America almost 40 years ago, pop culture has been fascinated with English rockers. So in the early 1980's, when spandex and makeup were coming into play in the Brit rock world, it seemed only natural to make a mock-rockumentary; it was ""THIS IS SPINAL TAP"". And boy, what a hoot it is. To this day, almost 20 years later, this movie is still very enjoyable, with its satire, silliness, and, actually, realism. Yes, many rock musicians have noted how realistic the movie is. Many of them admitted it on ""I Love The '80s"".
As for the movie's humour, it's not for everyone. (See some of the one-star reviews written by rocket scientists who think Spinal Tap was a real band.) It's kinda dry. But if you get it (like I do), then it's hysterical. Take, for instance, the following:
Nigel showing Marty DeBergi his guitars/amps.
Marty reading off some negative reviews for Spinal Tap albums.
The band taking the stage in Cleveland.
The infamous Stonehedge moment.
Priceless. This is actually brilliant humour; something that not every Chris, Mike, and Harry could pull off. (Get it?)
As for the music itself: Spinal Tap may have been a fictional band, but they might as well have been real. After all, the entire soundtrack was written/recorded by the actual actors. (That's right, that's really Chris Guest doing that solo.) ROCK AND ROLL!
So if you like rock & roll and laughter, check out this DVD. (Lots of cool bonus features too!) It may take a couple of watches for the humour to sink in, but trust me, it will. Now I'll close this review with a quote from Megadeth's Dave Mustaine:

Since Rob Reiner dreamed up this ""pseudo-rockumentary"" (after affixing some gold paint strategically on the USS Coral Seas baseball cap he wears--one of the many sight gags in the movie) the satirical assault on rock culture as been done and done again, perhaps a time or two too many.
The music itself is, shall we say, derivative with the Stones, some early Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and others having some distant unavoidable influence, while the unwashed antics of the stars both on stage and off have become cliches of the biz.  Worse yet, satirizing the documentary mode itself has been done to death.

182346,5,1559408758,"Spinal Tap. Not your everyday mulleted metal-rockers -- oh no, they're the loudest band in the world.

Or so says Marti DiBergi (played with a straight face by director Rob Reiner), in a hysterical ""rockumentary"" that focuses on the dumber side of rock'n'roll. ""This is Spinal Tap"" has become the quintessential rock'n'roll movie -- full of strangely lifelike jokes, gigantic hair, annoying girlfriends, hilarious acting, and a many an exploding drummer from time to time.

Spinal Tap, the loudest band in Britain, is returning to the US for the first time in years to promote their new album, ""Smell The Glove."" Trailing behind them is DiBergi, capturing every strange moment on film and interviewing the solemnly strange trio that makes up the core, Nigel (Christopher Guest), Derek  (Harry Shearer), and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean). Their many drummers have died in a series of bizarre freak accidents (including the vague ""gardening accident""), choking on someone else's vomit, and spontaneous combustion).

Charting the history of the band (including psychedelic rock) to the present, DiBergi chronicles the controversy that springs up around ""Smell the Glove""'s sexist cover (""What's wrong with being sexy?"" ""Sex-IST!""). After bizarre mishaps (a Stonehenge set the size of a cat), waning popularity and falling sales, the manager quits in anger and Nigel walks out. Is it the end of Spinal Tap?

One of the funniest ways make something funny is to stay really, really close to reality -- and that is where ""This is Spinal Tap"" strikes gold. It sticks JUST close enough to be semi-accurate, but remains just on the outside line of comedy --  basically, if you like laughtracks, gross-out humour and pratfalls, this isn't your kind of movie.

The humor is all the funnier because it's delivered in a deadpan manner: Nigel's amp that ""goes to 11,"" the cucumber incident, or when Derek gets trapped in a plastic pod, and has to be freed via a desperate roadie with a blowtowtorch. And sprinkled in between are little interviews between DiBergi and the band, littered with hilarious quotables (""It's like fire and ice, basically. I feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water"").

In fact, Reiner manages to craft a very believable rock'n'roll world, complete with label controversies, Sinatra-loving chauffeurs, groupies and frequent technical malfunctions. And the music... hoo boy, just try not to laugh at ""Gimme Some Money,"" ""Sex Farm,"" ""Listen To The Flower People,"" and the sidesplitting ""Big Bottom"" (""Big bottoms drive me out of my mind/how could I leave that behind?""). Not to mention Nigel's ghastly Druid monologue.

And rock in-jokes are sprinkled liberally through the movie. There are homages to Black Sabbath (the teeny Stonehenge), Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin (playing a guitar with a violin), and countless other little jokes. Even Jeanine is based on famed rock girlfriends like Yoko Ono and Anita Pallenberg.

As for the actors... well, reportedly they made up a lot of their dialogue on the wing, which might explain why they are so unspeakably funny. You'd almost think they were real -- in fact, a few uninformed people have.

Guest and McKean form the core of the story, as the lovably clueless Nigel (""It's one louder"") and the savvier, too-influenced-by-his-girlfriend David. These guys really rule the screen with their rambling dialogue and gigantic hair. The hairy Harry Shearer is less front-and-center, but both he's pretty funny too -- as is Reiner, who somehow manages to keep a straight face through it all.

""This is Spinal Tap"" is the ultimate rock movie -- a funny, deadpan, wittily mocking little look at the world's loudest band. A treasure.",1066089600,13,3737,5.098199672667758

I think it's more of a pastel black myself.
This infamous mockumentary details the life of the band, ""Spinal Tap"", and its members as they tour the USA. Many things happen to them that are very true to real rock bands, such as getting lost backstage, getting the wrong sized props for an onstage show, and having props not work right. And of course, hilarity ensues.
This mockumentary also reveals some of the history of Spinal Tap, such as the fact that every drummer who has ever been in the band has died under mysterious circumstances, such as Eric ""Stumpy Joe"" Childs, who choked on vomit(but we don't know whose).
In addition to this, we also see some of their early songs, complete with video. ""The Flower People"" is a song they did in the 60s, it looks like a cross between The Beatles and John Denver, and I could not stop laughing through the video.
What surprises me most about this movie, though, is that the music is actually good! And further more, it's actually played by Spinal Tap!
This edition of the DVD also includes over an hour of deleted scenes, four music videos (actual music videos, not just the scenes from the movie), commercials, and a few other extras that fit in great with a mockumentary.
Whether it is because the band members try to explain things the right way, or because of the paralells between real rock bands, or because the band members are talking about the spanish subtitles option in the subtitles menu, you will be laughing almost nonstop!

182351,5,1559408758,"When first delving into the world of heavy metal, my friend Matt (a.k.a. tkdmateo) informed me of this film, a funny ""rockumentary"" about a fictitious group called Spinal Tap.  The key members in this were guitarist/vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), guitarist/vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), keyboardist Tommy Pischedda (Bruno Kirby), and a slew of over 30 drummers in the course of their career.
This is one of those films where it's hilarious and sadly true simultaneously.  Stuff like this actually happens in the music industry; it may be overexaggerated, but it's all too true.  The drummers that keep ""spontaneously combusting"" or ""choking on vomit"" (or whatever else initiated their demise) is a homage and a parody of the legendary metal band Judas Priest, who kept switching drummers album after album (until 1980's British Steel).  Rob Reiner, acclaimed director of ""Stand By Me"" and ""A Few Good Men,"" also co-wrote the script (or improvisations, as most of the film was) with Shearer, Guest, and McKean, and he also ""hosts"" the film as Marty DiBergi.  He keeps the film satirical and hilarious, while also keeping the characters straight-forward and serious without making it campy.
The music is performed by all the actors, believe it or not, and the songs are often well-constructed and catchy, while also sporting some hilarious lyrics.  Songs including ""Big Bottom"" and ""Hell Hole"" are both praising and mocking rock, and some other songs like ""The Flower People"" exploit the time periods in which rock existed in a different mindset.
It's all played very well, and it features a few actors that come in as surprising cameos including Ed Begley, Jr., Patrick Macnee, Howard Hessman, and Billy Crystal (who happens to be a good friend of Mr. Reiner), among many others.  A revolutionary film, both for those who love rock n' roll and of improvisational comedy.  Even if you don't like it (for whatever reason, you are wrong), it's still a movie that MUST be seen because it is indeed a cinematic marvel.  Besides, how can you NOT laugh at hilarious scenes like the amplifier that goes to 11, or the album being rechanged to become the ""black album,"" in which no photos or text at all (perhaps Metallica was influenced by this film?)?

To sum it up in one sentence:  This movie is awesome.
I've wanted to see Spinal Tap for years.. I was 9 when it came out, and wanted to see it then... my parents wouldn't let me.  I eventually forgot about it, and didn't have a chance to see it until 19 years later.  (I feel old now.)  At any rate, this movie is just superb, following the waning career of British heavy metal band Spinal Tap.  Filmed just like a documentary, this film is genius.  (Which explains why it didn't do very well in theatres.. the general populace tends to take fluff, such as Titanic, over genius.)
Before I watched, I was expecting it to be something like Airplane.. just insane, nutsy comedy constantly.. rather, I found something that mirrored a real documentary.. some of it seemed to be serious for a while, before descending into side splitting humor.  The music makes fun of other bands.. most notable to me is ""Stonehenge"", which seems to be making fun and paying homage (at the same time) to Led Zeppelin.  Finally.. the most impressive part is that everyone learned to play the songs.. it's actually Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean playing their instruments and singing... no bad dubovers or mouthing of lyrics.  This just added so much to the film itself.  (Indeed, they actually 'toured' several clubs for a few months prior to filming to work on their performance.)

182360,5,1559408758,"Nigel Tufnel, (clearly the brains behind Tap, since without him the band can only muster a ""cozy"" 10 minutes of material,) serves as idiot savant in this free form jazz exploration.  When deconstructing the sublime ennui of the band as they amble through North America's more selective auditoriums, one notes an existential transition in their perspective (often too much perspective.)  From their other-worldy travels during the Flower People period to their joint festival appearance with a puppet show, Spinal Tap demonstrates the resiliance that defines the human spirit.  Tufnel, in particular, is driven with a desire to always go one louder, with his amplifyer, his solos, and his backstage culinary demands.  I for one was particularly moved when Nige tells David, ""do a good show,a'right?"" after informing the band that Sex Farm was climbing the charts in Japan.  In that moment we see the transformation of the Id to the Superego, the lifting of priorites from just performing Tonight I'm Gonna Rock Ya (Tonight) to preserving their enduring friendship.  I found Tap to be a moving tribute to near-competance amidst a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.",1052697600,2,1169,5.191489361702128

182362,5,1559408758,"Why was Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg knighted?  Why can't you dust for vomit?  Why must Nigel continually fold the small ryes until there is nothing left but crumbs?
  This superficial ""rockumentary"" (a term that is more stupid than clever) leaves many a stone(henge) unturned as it continually fails to delve deep enough.  A film that should have been portrayed as a deep psychological drama gives up and ends up playing everything for laughs.
  The how and why Sir Denis became knighted, could make for its own mini series on the BBC.  This question not only isn't answered, it isn't even raised!  Maybe you can't dust for vomit, but certainly DNA testing could prove whose vomit it is.  Any by examining the contents of the purged material, perhaps, something could be learned about its owner.  For example, if vegemite particles appear under the microscope, maybe the originator of the waste was Australian?  Perhaps, most disturbing is the fact that Nigel's obvious obsessive compulsive disorder, goes unrecognized and untreated.  It was so disturbing to watch him crumble the rye bread into oblivion backstage that I could barely watch.  Nigel's mental problems could have been documented by narrator Marti Dibergi in a way not seen on film since ""Sybil"".  Instead, this scene, like many others is played for laughs.  Nigel doesn't require bigger slices of bread because he is a pampered aging has-been rocker.  He requires it because he has a disease, one that often went unrecognized and untreated in 1984.  Nigel's mental fraily is witnessed a second time in the scene where he insists that his amplifier is louder just because ""it goes to eleven"".  Such auditory hallucinations are common in pscyotic individuals.
  In summary, Tap raises more questions than it answers, and it answers very few.  DiBergi fails time and again to ask insightful questions and not surprising, receives dim witted answers.  Unfortunately Tap crumbles like a Nigel prepared Sh-t Sandwich.",1049760000,3,1969,5.103448275862069

First off, you get the film, remixed with far superior picture and sound quality.  All the sounds, all the smells, are there for you to enjoy.  And as for the film, what is there left to say?  It is a brilliant look at what passed for rock n roll, circa 1984, without being condescending.  This is a film a fan of heavy metal could enjoy equally as much as someone who felt that this was just a passing fad.
The disc is great because you also get a great (albeit short) introduction by Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner, completly in character), as well as great trailers for the film (lookout for the ""cheese festival"" bit-it's a hoot).  Also, David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer, also in character) contribute a wonderful commentary track that is just as funny as the film (it turns out that Spinal Tap HATE the film-it makes them look too stupid).  As if that weren't enough, you also get over an hour of deleted scenes, edited together to give you a completely alternate film.  The only thing missing are the opening/closing credits.  Plus, all the music videos shot for the film, and a very funny TV appearence (from the Joe Franklin Show, who doesn't seem to be in on the joke).  All this on one disc!

But an even more interesting line is the one between parody and reality.  I have seen real 'rockumentaries' that are almost as self-important, dim, and pretentious as this one.  Part of the brilliance of this film is that it could almost be taken seriously.  Almost.  It is amazing to watch this and see the other people who show up in the backbround (or briefly in the foreground) of the rather impressive cast.  It includes Fran Drescher, Patrick MacNee, Dana Carvey, Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Howard Hessman, Angelica Huston, and Fred Willard.

Its subtle, biting jabs at the rock and role industry helped pave the way for great comedies like &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221; and &#8220;Best In Show,&#8221; and the performances (especially by Christopher Guest) are true class. Plus, this movie has just tons of memorable scenes (the amp that goes to eleven, the Stonehenge concert, the airport scene).
This DVD is also truly spectacular, and a must for Spinal Tap fans. The new 1.85:1 digital transfer looks a bit grainy, but it always has. The new 5.1 soundtrack is just plain excellent, finally giving us the chance to hear &#8220;Big Bottom,&#8221; &#8220;Hell Hole,&#8221; and &#8220;Sex Farm&#8221; in surround.
There are a ton of extras as well, most notable being the commentary by Guest, harry Shearer, and Michael McKean, who are in full character as Spinal Tap. It's as funny as the film itself.

The fact that some don't get the idea that it's fake all but adds to the amazing job of the director and actors in the improv-heavy film. It certainly gave the push Chris Guest needed to make other great mockumentaries like ""Waiting for Guffman"" or his recent ""Best in Show."" I highly suggest that anyone who has seen either of the previously mentioned films check out ""This is Spinal Tap."" It will give you a better view of how the pacing of dialogue, editing, and refusing to turn the camera ""off"" can create brilliant comedy. The DVD is packed with loads of extra features, and visual/sound quality does show improvement, but to clean it up too much would take away from the style of the film. It's meant to not sound JUST right (or look it for that matter). If you just feel that you can't make the jump yet to this film, start with Best in Show then work your way back to the more obscure.

182370,5,1559408758,"It amazes me that to this day, nearly 20 years later, there are still some people who thought this was real. That Spinal Tap actually existed. It's hilarious. This film is truly one of a kind. It perfectly lampoons the life, success, and downfall of a rock group. The film is shot as a documentary, or as this kind of film is, a 'mockumentary'. It's being done by director Marty DiBergi(Rob Reiner, who also directed and co-wrote the film), who is best known for commercials. He chronicles the life of legendary british band, Spinal Tap. The members of this band include David St. Hubbins(the always great Michael McKean), who is the vocalist of the group. Nigel Tufnel(the brilliant Christopher Guest), is the lead guitarist. Big mustached Derek Smalls(the great Harry Shearer), is the bass player. They started out in the mid 1960's as a mellower hippy/pop type band with songs like ""Listen(To What The Flower People Say)"". The documentary chronicles that to where they are today. They turned into a long haired, heavy metal group with songs like ""Big Bottom"", ""Sex Farm"", and others. The entire film shows their struggles to maintain their career as it appears to be falling down the tubes. Producers won't release their album, concerts are cancelled, no one comes to autograph signings. The inner turmoil within the band is showcased as well. They suffered from we could call, 'the Yoko syndrome', where St. Hubbins' girlfriend, Janine Pettibone(June Chadwick), comes into the picture and causes friction within the group. Throughout the film and interviews, there are concert clips showing the band in glorious action. The film was written by our three stars, and they must have spent time in this world because many musicians have stated the authenticity of it all. Not only did they write it and get it down pat, but these three guys also wrote every song and really performed them. They might not of been a real group, but they could of been. Keep your eyes peeled open for appearances by Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, and Fran Drescher at a party. Fred Willard and Ed Begley Jr., who have become Chris Guest regulars in his future films, appear here as well. Willard, as he will in the future films, steals every single frame he is in. Ed Begley, Jr. plays the band's original guitarist who died in an awful gardening accident. This continues as a running gag(that always works)thru the rest of the film concerning their drummers. The movie is funny. It's not the kind of comedy that a lot of people will get. Read the one star reviews below for that. It's a type of comedy that is very dry, but also very funny. If you are not in on it, you will not get it or respect it for what it is and is trying to do. Same goes for Guest's future films(Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show). The DVD comes with a great load of cool extras. The three guys, in character, give audio commentary. It's priceless. There is a new interview with Rob Reiner. There is a slew of other special features here. Over an hour of never before seen footage; Theatrical trailers; 6 TV commercials; an appearance on ""The Joe Franklin Show""; 4 music videos for ""Listen(To What The Flower People Say)"", ""Hell Hole"", ""Big Bottom"", and one I can't remember the name of. It's a hysterical film that hits on every mark. Definitley the funniest movie about music ever made, and the all time best 'mockumentary'. And once again, just to make sure, this was not a real band. Go ahead and see this. It's one of a kind.",1046908800,52,3487,4.680781758957655

If you have not seen Spinal Tap you absolutely MUST watch it at least once.  The movie is an comedy classic.  If you have seen the movie before, and are wondering if the DVD extras are worth the price, wonder no more.  This is a definite must have.
Most DVDs don't give you much in the way of extras, maybe a documentary and a trailer, if you're lucky.  The Spinal Tap DVD has an interview with Marti DeBergi, a bundle of ads, interviews with the band on television, and tons of deleted scenes.  Also, the DVD has a hysterical running comentary of the three leading band members.  The best part of the DVD is the commentary given by Guest, Shearer, and McKean in character--it's the band Spinal Tap watching the movie Spinal Tap, and giving their opinions of what you are seeing.  It's like getting twice the jokes in one movie.
To sum it up; I put off buying the DVD because it was a little more expensive than your average DVD, but when I finally caved I found that it was totally worth the extra cost.  Movies like this one are what make DVDs so great.",1043020800,,1204,4.241228070175438

Reiner directs and co-writes with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer (all three of whom also play the main three Spinal Tap members) and we get to see the misadventures on the road and a few live performances of the fictional band on the road.  So much could have gone wrong with this mockumentary, but thankfully Reiner and co. hit the satirical aspect dead on, and many bands from the era that this film was made are rightfully spoofed and no matter who you are you will not be able not to laugh.  All in all, fans of comedies or fans of heavy metal music with a sense of humor should more than give this a look.",1042588800,,782,4.531914893617022
182376,5,1559408758,"The movie itself is great.  It's a biting satire on the rock and roll industry, circa 1984 at which point it was pretty lifeless and brain dead.  It features three gifted comic actors who are, in understated and clever ways, as funny as anyone on the planet.
The second great thing about this DVD is the extra footage.  Clearly Reiner could have assembled a very funny 120-minute cut using some of this footage and also more footage from the four videos which are included on this DVD and are also very funny.  He went with a lean 83-minute cut instead, which maintained focus on the storyline, but any fan of the movie will want to see some of the unused stuff - more of every character.
The third way in which this is great is in providing an extra audio track in which the three principal members of Tap speak, in character (as always) about their memories of the film and the ways in which their ex-manager and director Marty DeBergi screwed them.  Three funny people, fully in character, improvising and bouncing off each other's ideas on the spot.

Some of the best moments of this film (in my opinion) are:
~the ""free-form jazz exploration"" or ""Jazz Odyssey"" at the festival park. ""On bass, Derek Smalls! He wrote this!""
~Nigel's guitar solo (you know...with the violin)
~Sex Farm! ""gettin' out my pitchfork,  pokin' your hay!""
~""no, The GIG is cancelled""
~Stonehenge
~""37 different people have been in this band over the years""
~Nigel's sustained guitar note ""aaaaaaaaahhh!""
~Big Bottom ""The looser the waistband, the deeper the quick-sand, or so I have read!""

This movie is absolutely hysterical.  It pokes fun at rock bands, especially heavy metal bands beyond their prime.  But you can find a little bit of all of them in here. I might never be able to look at Led Zepplin, Blue Oyster Cult or Deep Purple the same way ever again.  I don't want to ruin the film so here is one and only one example.  While getting ready to play a concert in Cleveland The band members exit their dressing rooms and actually get lost trying to find the stage.

Okay now I can't stop- or the bass player setting off a metal detector in the airport because he has a cucumber wrapped in aluminum foil in his pants to accentuate his ""package""... or during their gothic anthem ""Stonehendge"" a 20 inch monolith descends upon the stage with dwarfs dancing around it (lead guitarist #1 doesn't know the difference between feet and inches and screws up the design request)...

I would think this film broke new ground in the rockumentary/mockumentary genre *at* the time.  It takes the audience through daily life with the rock group called Spinal Tap.  The movie is shot like a featurette with a director interviewing the band members and following them around as they tour.  It also shows the ups and downs of being a rock group.  One minute they would be on top with stadiums packed with 5,000 audience members.  The next minute, they could be barely foist their albums despite signings and appearances.
This film employs very dry humor.  It's funny because it attempts to be serious.  The writers have made it a point to mock rockstars.  They're airheads.  David, the lead singer of the band, is constantly saying dumb things like every year countless people spontaneously combust.  Nigel is obssessive with his guitar collection.  The drummers seem to die and get replaced constantly.  Band members stuff cucumbers down their crotch.  It's entirely believable that these things happen with rockstars, but this film showcases a selection of stereotypes in one fell swoop.
(I think this film was fun to watch.  I could not believe the number of well-known celebrities that played a minor role in this film including Dana Carvey, Paul Schafer, Billy Crystal and Fran Drescher (she looked so young).)

Even the animated menu is funnier than some films' actual content.  This DVD definitely goes to 11.",1027468800,2,613,4.648148148148148
182388,5,1559408758,"It is not hard to make the argument that This is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest movies ever. It is brilliant from start to finish and is so rich with hilaious dialogue and physical acting that it will stand the test of infinite viewings. Rob Reiner is at his best in this movie, and keeps up admirably with the constant improvisation of the films stars. The camera never misses a beat, and if it does we don't know because it always finds something funy to focus on. Consider the scene in which the band's manager Ian is having a conversation with studio rep Bobbi Fleckman on the obscene nature of the album's cover (a woman is being forced to smell an outstretched male hand wearing a black glove). He more or less threatens to put out the album despite store boycotts. Fleckman dismisses the idea by saying ""money talks and [b.s.] walks."" The camera is not on her as she says this, it is instead on Ian's face as he displays a hilarious look of bewilderment at the uttering of such a statement which he seems to have taken a little too literally. It is moments like these that will continue to pop up and amuse viewers forever, should they tire of the bigger jokes in the movie. Indeed that is the mark of a great comedy.
The advantage that This is Spinal Tap has over other comedies is that it's subject of rock and roll and in particular rock stars, has perpetually been the provider of unintentional comedy. The behavior of the band in this movie, as hilarious and over the top as it may be, can never be too far from the truth. For an example of this, think of how an all black cover is a comedy piece in this movie, and yet a few years later Metallica released one of the most successful albums of the past 20 years with an almost identical cover. Thats not to say that Metallica is on Spinal Tap's level of absurdity, but it is just proof that no matter what lengths the movie goes to in order to poke fun at rock stars, it can never stray too far from the truth. That provides even more depth and humor to a movie and helps to further cement its reputation as a true classic.",1026604800,,2088,4.288607594936709

182394,5,1559408758,"I've nothing to add about the quality of this picture - without a doubt it's the funniest rock spoof of all time (well, it's not exactly hard, is it? Can you think of another one that's actually funny?), but for my money I can't think what beats it for the title of funniest movie of all time, bar none.
I'm curious, though, that a couple of people mark it down as seeming 'tame' compared to what rock bands do now. Come again? Surely this misses the point? Spinal Tap was, and is, a dead-eye satire; it was not intended to be overblown at all. This is why so many people (including me, first time) didn't realise it was a spoof and consequently rated it a dull documentary about a bad band - it's completely on the money.
The bands of the seventies really did all this stuff - a lot of it is based on recorded fact. What is more amazing - and more telling, is that bands since haven't stopped! Bands STILL have umlauts over the wrong letters (Queensrche!), they STILL record experimental jazz concept albums (Radiohead!), they STILL release albums with black on black covers (Metallica!).
This film functions as a handy reference point for when rock bands can still be taken seriously and when they have gone over the edge into parody. All you have to do is ask: could Spinal Tap have done that?
So: Eric Johnston claims to be able to be able identify the brand of battery in his distortion pedal by the sound it produces. Sensible, or Tapular? TAPULAR!
Steve Vai plays a seven string guitar. On an album called Passion and Warfare. Sensible or Tapular? TAPULAR!
Radiohead insist on playing in their own tent so no corporate sponsors can advertise. sensible or Tapular? TAPULAR!
And you know what? the cucumber scene isn't even nearly the funniest. The little vignettes are what make tap so rewarding to rewatch. Every time you'll pick up a new point.  Nigel (from Squatney!) takes a cue off Jimmy Page, but plays hisguitar solo not with a violin bow, but a violin! And then stops and tunes it half way through! Genius!

182395,5,1559408758,"This review will only talk about the features included on this DVD.  My review of the movie proper was posted December 1, 2000.
---
My favourite part of this collection has got to be the animated graphics between the different sections, a shining example of which is the title card for the ""Special Features"" section, which emerges from the insides of Derek's trousers wrapped in tin foil.
Running a close second is the audio commentary.  Chris Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer don't do a typical cast commentary.  Instead, they, as their Tap alter egos (Tufnel, St. Hubbins, and Smalls respectively) perform a 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000'-style vivisection on the film, and the people involved in its making.  Director Marty DiBergi is a manipulative backstabber.  Manager Ian Faith is a thief and a liar.  Keyboardist Viv Savage is a drooling buffoon and an unconvincing lip syncher.  Even the boys themselves can't stay out of the way of the pointed barbs (Smalls: ""Hello!  Yellow Trousers.  What was that idea?""  St. Hubbins: ""Well he [Nigel] had taken up golf."").  The track's best running joke:  Every bit player or background extra is thought to have passed on (""See the Philipino guy in the background?  He's dead..."").  Then, typically, when they get to the scene by Elvis' graveside, they quite obviously remark, ""He's dead"", before launching into the off-key harmonies of 'Heartbreak Hotel'.  This level of necrophilia shows that after 20 years, as David says, the boys have too much perspective.
The commentary is like another mini-film, pasted on top of the original.  Obviously all improvised, it shows that the Tap are still very much in touch with their vivid characters.
The rare outtakes section, when watched in one sitting, forms a nice little alternate movie to the original.  There's over an hour's worth of material here, and it's all golden.  But, surprisingly, it's rarely funny.  Rather, we get a different glimpse into the character's lives: Derek (who gets a lot more airtime here) was dealing with the fallout from a messy divorce; we meet David's long lost son; and we see what Nigel was up to during his hiatus from the band.  I found it fascinating, and it furthered my own notion (touched upon in my original review) that the Tap are more than just cartoonish caricatures.  They are meant to be living breathing people with real lives.  The outtakes show this side of them nicely.
Additional features include a press conference during the ""Flower People"" days that offers Tap's most direct spoofing of the Beatles (Q: ""How do you find the girls on tour?""  A: ""Turn left at the men""), a brief and grainy clip of Tap on the Joe Franklin Show, and three cheesy (pun intended) commercials for some kind of pizza pastry product called ""Rock and Rolls"".  All, while not enhancing the movie watching experience in the slightest, are the kind of detailed miscellanea that make Tap so intriguing.",1015459200,8,2929,4.9427402862985685
182396,4,1559408758,"I'm disappointed that Christopher Guest, being the brilliant director that he is, has only made 3 major movies in his long career.  This one, Waiting for Guffman, and Best in Show.  Owning both of the latter movies, i decided to rent the one that started it all.  And while it was funny, and was a brilliant directoral debut and a groundbreaking movie for the new genre in 1984, this one doenst measure up to his other movies.  Its a cult classic, and i can see why.  Its that certain type of humor that some think is hilarious, and some just don't get.  There small chuckles throughout the movie, like when they are describing their anti-femenist album cover, and some great moments where i almost laughed until i cried- like when they had the 18 INCH stone display on the stage, and when they were in those bubble things and one of the guitarists couldn't get out.  Im laughing out loud just thinking about it now.  But do yourself a favor and rent this- even if you don't like it, just to say that you have seen it.

182402,5,1559408758,"Finaly, A DVD adds up to the great film.
Lets start with the fim itself.
Spinal Tap is a rare comic gem.  A masterpeice if you will.  If I didn't know better, I would have thought this was a real documetury.  It's shot just like what.  And it demenstartes how a rock band would act back stage.  For instance, Nigel (Guitarist) complains about how small his bread is and that he wants it bigger.  And when Spinal app can't figure out where the heck the stage is.
The Extras are amazing.  The commentery is very funny, with the actors portraying themselves as the characters. Even though this great, I would like it if they included a commentery with the rea actors.
The 70 minutes worth of deleted scenes are great as well.  They add much to the plot are actualy funnier than what appears in the film.
The rest are music videos are entertaining and the commercials for ""Rock and Rolls"" are odd, but ae funny.",1007683200,,907,4.421686746987952
182403,5,1559408758,"I can't believe that I hadn't seen this movie sooner.  I was very surprised by this very clever and hilarious ""mockumentary."" (Yes, this isn't a real documentary.  Like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" a lot of people thought this movie was real.)  And now that it is restored and loaded with extras, the film is even better.
The movie is about a heavy metal band, Spinal Tap, who goes on tour and hopes to sell their new album, ""Smell the Glove"" to Tap fans everywhere.  Along that road to fame comes bumps and unexpected events.  The band starts to fight with each other while cities are starting to cancel their tours.  Though this movie is hilarious, it's funny in a very subtle way, so it makes you believe that you are watching an actual documentary.  As funny as it may seem, the movie does seem to have a ring of truth when it comes to the music business.
This DVD is loaded with extras!  The funniest part is when you go to the menu and you hear the band trying to figure out what the buttons mean.  (""That one means `Play.'""  ""But I didn't bring any of my instruments, I didn't know we had to play."")  It's pretty funny to hear the whole thing.  There are also lots of rare out-takes that are defiantly worth seeing.
The best feature of all is the audio commentary, which is done by Spinal Tap.  (Yes, they stay in character throughout the whole commentary.)  It's great listening to it the second time you see it.  You hear the band members accusing the director of the documentary trying to make them look bad, and using ""special"" cameras that they couldn't see.  They also try to figure out what the name of their skull head statue was.  It's pretty funny when they accuse the director of having a fake beard.  (""Look, it's got glue all over on it.  Now, he's scratching it again.)  Definitely check out the audio commentary when you can.
""This is Spinal Tap"" is a cult classic, and is an awesome movie.  It's a very clever satire of documentaries on rock bands.  This is a classic film that you will not forget.",1007164800,8,2019,4.429347826086956

182411,5,1559408758,"As David St. Hubbins, lead singer of Spinal Tap, so pointedly observes, ""It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.""  This Is Spinal Tap is a movie that treads this fine line and is almost always on the clever side.  A mock ""rockumentary,"" with Rob Reiner as the director (of both the rockumentary and the real movie), this film is a romp through the world of heavy metal music, and is very funny as well.  Following Spinal Tap on a tour of the U.S., Reiner's character Marty DiBergi gives us the inside scoop on the band - the post-show parties, the frustration when concerts are cancelled and hotel bookings lost, controversy over a sexist album cover, etc.  When St. Hubbin's wife arrives (whom the lead guitarist Nigel is jealous of), things really go off the rails and Spinal Tap sinks to a new low, playing for a party on an air force base.
The details of the plot are fairly unimportant, as very little actually occurs.  The fun is in the dialogue - Nigel's distress at bread that is too small and his infatuation with his amp that goes to 11, St. Hubbin's revealing that he's named for the patron saint of quality footwear, and the drummer revealing that ""as long as there's sex and drugs, I could do without the rock and roll.""  And, of course, my personal favourite, the bassist Small's prosthetic ""limb,"" a strategically placed cucumber.  Similarly, there's great fun involved in the concert numbers, with such notable tunes as ""Big Bottom,"" ""Sex Farm,"" and ""Hell Hole.""  The fact that the dialogue was mostly unscripted, that the actors adopted their characters as alter-egos and lived in the parts, gives the film an unpolished quality and a feel of ""authenticity"" that many real documentaries lack.
Reiner wisely keeps the film short at 75 minutes or so.  Any longer and the momentum would have waned.  The choice of actors is suberb - they really play the instruments and sing the songs, and keep their parts distinct and self-consistent.  That all the parts are played with such utter seriousness and sincerity only increases the hilarity. The film itself, especially compared with some of Reiner's later work, probably ""only"" rates a 4 out of 5.  The profusions of extras on this DVD raises this disc to a 5.  There is an hour of extra footage cut from the movie.  While the cuts could have been easily incorporated into the movie, I'm glad they weren't due to the aforementioned momentum.  There's also 4 music videos, 3 of which are just the full versions of songs that were truncated in the film, but fun to watch nonetheless.  There are assorted other interviews and comments, and a full audio commentary of the 3 main characters (in character), which is quite amusing.
Clearly, a lot of effort went into making this film, and the proof is up there on the screen - it's a fun film, with enough nuances that it can be watched over and over again.  The extras on the DVD make it well worth the price.",998265600,2,2925,4.648543689320388

The DVD version of this film is exactly why I bothered to even buy a DVD player in the first place.  It is loaded full of scenes deleted from the original film, (and many are hilarious) and many of these ""deleted"" scenes lend credence to some of the storylines in the theatre version.  For example, Billy Crystal's mime character appears for several minutes, and Bruno Kirby's limo driver spends one wild night partying with Tap.

The end result is a much-needed continuation of the story, with some hilarious moments resembling Mystery Science Theater 3000. You can tell they were just winging it, and it doesn't give a complete update on the bad, which i would have liked, but it's great nonetheless. An included interview with Dibergo is also funny and informative, but the audio commentary is better.  This is a first for DVDs as far as I know. I would like to see an MST treatment extra included with all DVDs. It's boring when the director drones on about how great it was to work with all the loser actors or whatever.

So classic that you should have bought it and watched it 5 years ago!",993081600,,565,4.2924528301886795
182421,5,1559408758,"INTRODUCTION: In 1982, an aging (40ish) English band is embarking on its 1st American tour in 6 years to promote a new album, ""Smell the Glove,"" which is not quite ready for distribution due to management dispute over its lurid, sexist cover art. Spinal Tap has had its commercial and popularity ups-and-downs since the mid 1960s. Although supposedly one of England's loudest heavy-metal bands, their catalogue actually includes a wide range of musical styles. The 3 primary musicians include guitarist and lead vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitarist and auxillary vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and bass guitarist and background vocalist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer).
David is a somewhat pompous, pseudo-intellectual who likes ruffles, velvet and satin stage attire and has a rather pushy, astrologically attuned girlfriend (Jeanine exerts a major cosmic influence on David's life and creates a wedge between him and childhood friend Nigel). Nigel is a confused chain-smoking, gum-chewing, accomplished guitarist with strong juvenile tendencies, a love of kilts, and a knack for inane invention. Derek prefers a studs-and-leather stage presence but is perhaps the most intelligent of the lot and assumes the role of realist and peacemaker.
Filmmaker and fan Martin DiBergi (Rob Reiner) accompanies them on this tour to create a documentary of the experience, but Spinal Tap will later accuse Marty of making a ""hatchet job"" by portraying them in an unfavorable and unflattering light. Marty's film does tend to focus on the historic failings of the band, their apparent waning popularity, and the few(?) times on tour when they couldn't find the stage; had cancellations, production failures, embarrassments, and lapses in competence; bickered amongst themselves; acted like prima donnas; sported their herpes sores; and couldn't meaningfully or coherently answer his interview questions.
The film is almost entirely improvised from a skeletal plan. The comedy is subtly and richly layered with humorous but realistic character portrayals, malapropisms, double entendres, and numerous sight gags. Reality is only slightly skewed, with no in-your-face gross-outs or over-acting to emphasize the obvious. These guys are not only brilliant improvisors, but they are also fine musicians capable of performing a serious-but-quirky, full-length concert (1993 ""Return of Spinal Tap"" concert/comedy video). They really have written and performed all the wonderful lyrics and arrangements by themselves. Classics like ""Big Bottom,"" ""Bitch School,"" and ""Sex Farm.""
This film grows on you like an untreated fungus. Note that you probably will need multiple viewings (without interruption) to fully appreciate the humor and to become hooked, but you will love it more and get more out of it each time it is viewed.
REVIEWER CONTEXT: 48-year-old female (a scientist and not in the entertainment or music business) who saw the movie for the first time (!) in October 2000 and who loves rock-and-roll (particularly the 1960s and 1970s ""British Invasion"" bands) but not raucous ""heavy metal"" sounds or outrageously gross personas. Comedy preferences include films such as the Monty Python features, the Pink Panther series, A Fish Called Wanda, Blame it on the Bellboy, The Birdcage, Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, etc.
THE PRODUCT(S): The new VHS tape (MGM Special Edition) adds 10 minutes of out-take footage, including the ""Bitch School"" music video. The new DVD (MGM Special Edition) includes an audio overlay for the film itself (ad-libbed, in-character commentary (""defense"") by the 3 principle musicians), about 70 minutes of out-take footage (presented sequentially like the film), a DiBergi update, 4 music videos (excluding Bitch School), other promotional clips, film trailers, advertisements and interviews. It caused me to buy a DVD player.
There is also a 1993 VHS ""Return of Spinal Tap,"" which is a real London sell-out concert from July, 1992, interspersed (approximately every 3 songs) with comedy inserts and interviews; a 4.5 hour bootleg tape (presumably the original director's cut); 2 real CDs (1984 soundtrack and 1992's Break Like the Wind); a recent book (Spinal Tap Companion by Karl French) with transcripts, lyrics, and other delights; and older materials that are no longer available except through auctions. The out-of-print Criterion DVD from several years ago has a somewhat different selection of out-takes; audio commentary overlays from (1) McKean/Guest/Shearer as their real selves and (2) Reiner and the production crew; and the 20-minute demo tape originally made to try to obtain studio funding.",992908800,17,4656,5.531556802244039
182422,5,1559408758,"This is such a great movie, and the DVD has great extras that make this well worth the money.  The audio commentary by Spinal Tap (in character no less) is so funny, I was laughing throughout.  This DVD also has music videos and outtakes that are also funny.  Spinal Tap alone was a funny movie, the DVD with the added extras (particularly the audio commentary) make this a stellar movie.  Also worth seeing are the other two mockumentaries by Christopher Guest (it's the six-fingered man!) and Eugene Levy: Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show.",992563200,,545,4.705263157894737

182424,5,1559408758,"Did you ever think that Spinal Tap was a real group? Then you were probably appalled at their appearances on the late shows! But if you were like me you became an instant fan once you knew the secret.
So, is the Criterion DVD good?  Yes!  But don't go searching for the Break Like The Wind stuff because it ain't there. Several of the best videos were included on the 1992 VHS release.  But they are missed in this DVD form.  What IS included is great!  A lot of outtakes-some funny, some not. Although several bits I feel could've stayed in, you'll agree that they used the best stuff for the final film. It's interesting to note that most drug references and all the nudity was clipped from the film. Also, the actress from the movie ""Just One Of The Guys"" was clipped.  The new lead guitar player was a very interesting idea.  Perhaps that should've stayed in.  Other material: commercials, promotional materials, complete videos, interviews (such as the Flower People press conference), and more. Plan to spend almost 3 and a half hours on this DVD. It's great fun! The DVD interface is one of my favorites; with new stuff recorded just for the DVD presentation.
So put this in your machine, crank it up (the sound quality is pretty good) and put Spinal Tap on BEFORE the puppet show!",990662400,2,1288,4.545454545454546
182425,5,1559408758,"The classic among classics, this movie will have you rolling.  It's the only movie that will leave your sides hurting without ever telling a joke.

182426,5,1559408758,"Rob Reiner's This is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest movies of all time period.  Let alone funniest movie about Rock and Roll.  This is the perfect send-up of big stadium rock bands from the seventies and eighties.  From the gigantic skull prop to the double neck bass, this movie captures everything that is humorous about heavy metal bands on tour.  Most of the humor is subtle though, so this might not appeal to a Chris Farley or Adam Sandler fan.  But for many, this film will have you rolling in the aisles.
The DVD version is especially worth the value.  Besides the classic feature, you get over and hour of outtakes that makes up an alternate movie almost as funny as the original.  There's also a bunch of other add on's and special features like music videos, commentary, and trailers.  Buy it!",989884800,4,807,4.555555555555555

The outtakes/deleted scenes (which I had only read about) add so much more to what was already a great film. I laughed 'til I had tears.
But I laughed most while listening to the running commentary by David, Nigel and Derek both at the beginning of the disc (discussing how black the screen was) and during the movie (commenting on who they though was dead, now...how Marty's beard was fake....on Ian being...Ian, and the dreaded Janine...etc.)
I think this film on DVD is an example of why the format is so wonderful.

182428,5,1559408758,"This is Spinal Tap is the brilliant rockumentary/mockumentary chronicling the band Spinal Tap's tour of the United States.  This was Rob Reiner's debut film,  and what a film to begin with. This is Spinal Tap remains somewhat of a cult classic,  but its hilarious characters,  awesome music,  and brilliant storyline comes to life on screen,  and everyone could enjoy this movie.  Michael McKean plays the lead singer David St.  Hubens to perfection,  while Harry Shearer plays Derek Smalls with great finesse. A young Christopher Guest plays Nigel with a quiet brilliance,  and Guest would incidentally go on to direct and star in two of his own mockumentary films,  WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW,  which I must say,  are equally genius,  especially the recent sleeper hit BEST IN SHOW.  Also great is Tony Hendra,  as the cricket-stick wielding manager of the band. June Chadwick is strong as David's girlfriend Jeannine,  and Bruno Kirby makes a great cameo as the limo driver.  The other supporting cameos are fantastic,  coming from Fred Willard(who won a Best Supporting Actor award from the LA Critics for his role in BEST IN SHOW),  Dana Carvey,  Billy Crystal,  Fran Drescher,  Angelica Huston, and Paul Shaffer.  This utterly hilarious movie is excellently directed by Reiner,  who plays the director of the mockumentary within the film,  Marty Dibergi!  Fantastic!",988934400,5,1382,5.108108108108108

It is full of satire of distinct metal bands such as Iron Maiden (I think it is the biggest influence for Tap) , Black Sabbath , Dio , Rolling Stones ...

Spinal Tap was on and I remember thinking, ""Man, they stink.""  I continued to watch as I couldn't believe how crap this band were. I found myself laughing at them and pointing to the screen, looking around my room for people who were not there to agree with me that they are just idiots -
""What's the difference between sexy and sexist?"" ""There's such a fine line between clever and ... stupid.""  ""That guitar's never been played..No, don't touch it...Don't even look at it.""  ""Scotland Yard just doesn't have the equipment to dust for vomit.""  ""A musical about Jack the Ripper called 'Saucy Jack'""
After it was over I found myself humming along to 'Stonehenge'  (which nearly was crushed by dwarves), and Big Bottoms (talk about mud-flaps, my girls got 'em).

182433,5,1559408758,"Superb (m/r)ockumentary of the semi-fictitious band ""Spinal Tap"", made up of Michael McKean (""Lenny"", soul mate of Squigy, on the TV series ""Laverne & Shirley""), Christopher Guest (actor/director of ""Waiting for Guffman""), Harry Shearer (performs voices of 22 different characters on ""The Simpsons""), and a random selection of ever-changing drummers.  The movie is a tongue-in-cheek parody of washed-up hard rock bands that still think they are God's gift to the universe.  The inspired idiocy borders on genius at times, lending weight to Michael's observation that there is a ""fine line between stupid and clever"".
The DVD is simply amazing.  For starters, everything is in character.  From the style of the main menu title screen, to the menu voice-overs by the band, and extending through all of the extra material included on the DVD, the personas of the band (and the fictitious director as well) are maintained with perfect consistency.
What makes this all the more amazing is the shear quantity of extras on the disk.  For starters, there is about an hour of ""deleted"" scenes provided.  In addition, there are numerous music videos, TV commercials (fake I presume???), and trailers.  And as if that weren't enough, there is also a commentary track throughout the entire film with the band members, completely in character, being as hilariously idiotic as they are in the film.  The Spinal Tap commentary track is easily the most entertaining commentary in my extensive DVD library.
The DVD medium is put to splendid use as well.  Menu transitions are computer animations inspired by some of the film's funniest moments.  Each menu plays a different ""Tap"" song, giving you access to a decent percentage of the sound track.  And, just as importantly, the animations are not overdone; the menus are still easy to use, and the transitions only take a few seconds.
Overall, this DVD is a great value, and provides a vast amount of material not available in the VHS version.  If you are a Tap fan, or would like to be, you NEED this DVD!

182434,4,1559408758,"This Is Spinal Tap pokes fun at documentary films with what faux director Marty DiBergi calls a rockumentary.  While MTV took this title and actually had rockumentaries, VH1's wildly successful Behind The Music series is a take off (albeit a serious one) of Tap's concept.  Michael McKean, Christopher Guest & Harry Shearer star as a fictional English heavy metal band Spinal Tap.  The film follows them around on their concert tour and the hoopla surrounding the release of their album Smell The Glove.  The three stars are hysterical.  They conduct themselves with a mock seriousness and that better than everyone attitude that stars often assume.  The concert sequences are great as the Tap's songs are great spoofs of the metal genre with titles like ""Stonehedge"" & ""Big Bottoms"".  The movie is woefully short, so the extra footage is a welcome addition.  Tony Hendra is brilliant as the band's put upon manager and a young Fran Drescher shows up as a record label executive while Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal have a small bit as mime waiters.",981072000,7,1048,4.9147727272727275
182435,5,1559408758,"There's nothing to really say about the film itself that has not been said many times before.  This is _the_ standard for the sometimes overdone art of mockumentary filmmaking.  Viewers owe this film a debt of gratitude for any and all films in the genre since thenk, including the brilliant work of Christopher Guest.  One would think that even The Blair Witch boys owe a nod to Tap for the reality style of fiction.
Beyond the sheer brilliance and hilarity of the movie itself, the extra features of this new DVD release make it a must-own, even if you have the original DVD release.  The extra footage is over an hour in length, with deleted scenes that are just as funny as some of the bits in the movie.  The scene where the limo driver gets intoxicated and sings in his underwear is a scream.  Also, there are things like television spots for some sort of packaged sandwich thing that are great for Tap fanatics.  Even the automatic menu opening when the disc is popped in is funny, with the Tapsters commenting on the logo.
Anyone who is in the music business, has seen the music business, or simply loves music, will find this movie hilarious.  The extra features are only one more strong reason to buy this and put it in a place of honor on the DVD shelf.",980899200,,1264,4.465217391304348

The DVD is a treasure trove for Tap fans.  In addition to over one hour (!) of additional mockumentary footage, the DVD contains music videos, an interview with Reiner in character, promotional materials, and the funniest audio commentary track you will ever hear.

In the years I was in rock bands, I encountered so many of the topics in the movie - the arguments, band meetings, people quitting and rejoining, new band direction when member leaves, name changes...  they are not as exaggerated in the movie as you may think.  I highly recommend Spinal Tap for anyone, but it is a must see for musicians!

182439,5,1559408758,"This is the movie that turned me on to Christopher Guest's unique style of subtle comedy (though This is Spinal Tap is hardly subtle).  After watching Best of Show and Waiting for Guffman, it's clear that this is disproportionately Guest's movie, despite the (obvious and extremely beneficial) shared writing credits between him, McKean, Shearer, and Reiner.
I recommend this movie to pretty much everyone who has an interest in music (especially the music of the 60's, 70's, and 80's) and a healthy sense of humor.  No one is immune to this satire, with pretty clear (and not so clear) jabs at the Beatles, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and countless other groups.  Add to that a ""fake"" music group that has about as much musical talent as some of the ""real"" groups from the era that they're satirizing, and you've got a masterpiece of a movie.
This DVD takes it another step and adds in over an hour of cut footage that adds a lot to the story, and adds a lot more laughs.  It would have been nice to have the option to plug the outtakes back into the movie in their original places (like in the X-Men DVD), but merely having them there is a big plus in itself.  Other extras, like commentary from the characters, music videos for some of their songs, multiple trailers and TV advertisement spots, and other more minor extras make this a must have DVD for anyone who enjoys this type of movie.",979344000,26,1403,4.573705179282869

The lyrics are a trasure-trove of obscene innuendo, Ringo-like euphamisms, and senseless combinations of bizarre phrases.

By the 80's few people listened to or even knew about these ""lesser"" heavy metal gods.  Fortunately, in 1984 young director (Marty DiBergi), made a low-budget documentary about Tap.
Unfortunately, strained relationships and their lasting inability to keep a drummer alive for an entire tour eventually took its toll on the band.  But DiBergi really captured the essence of what it is like to be on the road with an ear-pounding, mind-dulling, powerhouse from England.
What the band lacked in sex-appeal, talent and proper hygiene, they made up for with ear-deafening volume, spandex and cucumbers.  But if you're like me, by the end of the film you'll be singing along with songs such timeless classics as Hell Hole, Big Bottom and Sex Farm Woman.

182445,5,1559408758,"Spinal Tap is one of the most clever, incisive satires ever made.  Rob Reiner, et. all created the ""mockumentary"" genre with this film and it's influence and relevance today is as strong as ever.
This is Spinal Tap follows the tour of a British heavy metal band of the same name.  Though Spinal Tap is a ficticious band created for this film, the band and situations bare such verisimilitude to the actual music industry to this day many people still think that Spinal Tap was a real band.
There is so much to this film that a review of a few hundred words can't possibly due it justice.  Spinal Tap subtly and mericlessly satires virtually every aspect of the music industry.  First the fans:  Though Spinal Tap never really existed, when the movie was being filmed in different cities, the creators took out ads that read ""Legendary English Heavy Metal Band"" (or something to that effect).  The producer accurately gauged how many people would show up based on the degree of promotion.  When ""fans"" did show-up, they expressed a remarkable degree of loyalty for a band they only heard about in the last 24 hours.
Not only is the music industry lampooned, but Reiner and Co managed to take a dig at virtually every popular act since the 1950s; some very subtle, so obvious.  Many of the jokes are so subtle that you will not notice them the first time.  I've seem Spinal Tap at least 8 times and each time I catch something new.
What's remarkable about Spinal Tap is it's accuracy and insightfulness.  Though it's presented in a comical, slightly exaggerated way (only slightly exaggerated) everything that happens in this film is realistic:  Equipment problems, declining popularity, bickering bandmembers and managers, just to name a few.  This can best be illustrated by the reaction of Steven Tyler to this film (I'm not an Aerosmith fan, but it's a good story).  This film was released in 1984 when Aerosmith was at the nadir of their popularity (Tyler was so broke he was sleeping on his manager's couch).  Tyler said that he almost cried because this film so accurately portrays the experiences of a band declining in popularity.
Spinal Tap is as fresh today as it was 16 years ago.  Though the particulars of the popular music scene may have changed, the industry hasn't and with the growth of documentary programs such as ""Behind the Music"", Spinal Tap is more relevant than ever.
On a general note, Spinal Tap seems to be the kind of comedy you'll either get or you won't.  Some people love it, while others don't find it funny at all.  Particularly, people who are really into hard rock/heavy metal don't seem to understand it, perhaps because the satire is so subtle.  Also, a good historical understanding of popular music and the machinery of the music industry is necessary to understand some or the humor.",976492800,7,2822,4.747950819672131
182446,5,1559408758,"So I've seen 'Spinal Tap' about a dozen times by this point.  That's one more than 11, for those of you scoring at home (Sorry, just trying to get that obligatory reference out of the way early).  What amazes me most about the movie is that even though the jokes are cultural relics by this point, and you can see (remember) them coming from a mile away, they still elicit an honest to goodness chuckle.  You know when the title card reads ""Cleveland, Ohio"" that it's time for the Tap to get lost in the basement on their way to the stage.  You know when Nigel diagrams Stonehenge that when the prop shows up it will be 18 inches instead of 18 feet tall.  And you know that when the band breaks into ""Rock 'n' Roll Creation"", Derek will get stuck in his pod.  You know all these things.  And yet you wait for the punchline.  And when the punchline happens, you laugh.  Staying power like that is a sign of a well-constructed joke.
What surprised me about the movie when I saw it recently, was that amongst a sea of cartoonish caricatures, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest give strikingly real performances.  Their David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel (the band's ""poetic visionaries"") come off as complete characters.  I didn't notice this upon viewing the movie the first couple of times.  McKean manages to show some of David's manic anguish at being relegated to the deletion bin, as well as his pride at creating a prosperous musical relationship.  Guest's Tufnel is lovably dim-witted for the most part (the mini sandwich scene is good evidence of this), but his jealousy when David's girlfriend shows up is tangible and quite touching.  I don't think these two actors get the credit they deserve for their textured performances (look at me talking about ""textured performances"" during a 'Spinal Tap' review, but there you have it).
Like I said before, the other characters barely escape two-dimensionality.  Harry Shearer's Derek Smalls has some shining moments, my favourite being his stunt at the airport metal-detector.
What makes this movie the classic that it is are the songs.  Never mind the fact that they are outstanding parodies of heavy metal's penchants for primitive double entendres (hello AC/DC).  The most astounding thing to me is that they were written and performed by the actors themselves.  And they ably shift from youthful skiffle music (""All the Way Home""), to watered-down psychedelia (""(Listen to the) Flower People""), to stupid hard rock (the triple-bass workout ""Big Bottom"" is my favourite), to... um... free jazz (""Jazz Odyssey"").  It's hardly fair that these men get to be both this funny and this musical at the same time.  And the fact that the boys can play their instruments elevates the concert footage above other instances of actors-as-musicians.  I find it terribly distracting when the fingers on the fretboard don't match the tones coming from the amp.
So 'Tap' is good.  Well, we all knew that.  What I'm here to say is that 'Tap' stays good, no matter how many times you've seen it.",975628800,8,3033,4.812741312741313
182447,5,1559408758,A must-have for anyone who loved the movie. The extra footage is extensive and hilarious. And the movie itself just gets funnier every time I watch it.,974246400,,151,4.62962962962963
182448,4,1559408758,"I always compared Spinal Tap to a fine wine....the longer you let it age, the better it will taste.  Watching this DVD proves my rather silly comparison.  This film is so funny, and with the addition of over an hour of footage, this Spinal Tap DVD provides an overwhelming amount of laughter.  I find this film funnier now then when I first saw it over 10 years ago.  Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner aka ""Meathead"") is back with his rockumentary classic in the digital medium.  The graphic design on the package and disc itself is simple.....it's black.  I'm sure the members of Spinal Tap approved this color since you can't get any more black then this.  The inner pamphlet contains updates on the members of Spinal Tap, including a ""Drummer Necrology"" of all the drummers that died throughout the years.  A funny little read, but I always seem to want more from an inner pamphlet!  I popped in the DVD and immediately started to laugh.  As the main menu started to load, the band started talking about the menu.  You really have to listen to it to understand, but if you are slow at deciding what you are going to choose, the band members have plenty to say to ammuse you while you decide.  Anyway, the choices you have are ""Scene Selections"", which has a very impressive graphical design.  Scenes are numbered and each one has a picture and description.  You have a choice of French or Spanish subtitles while listening to the band chatter brainlessly about what a subtitle is!  Your final choice from the main menu is ""Special Features.""  You can watch the film with audio commentary by the band which is really funny because the bands IQ seems to have decreased throughout the years!  You also have a recent interview with Marty DiBergi, and you can watch over 1 hour of rare outtakes which are hysterical!  You can click ""Vintage Material"" and watch the 'Flower People' press conference and the 'Joe Franklin Show' with the band.  You will find yourself laughing again and again!  You have the choice of watching 4 music videos including ""Gimme Some Money"", ""Flower People"", ""Hell Hole"", and ""Big Bottom"".  You have a button titled ""Promotional Materials"" where you can watch the theatrical trailer, 3 TV spots and a few other funny trailers and commercials.  The final button titled ""Commercials"" has all 3 ""Rock & Rolls"" spots....all silly, all funny.  So I started to watch the film and a smile came to my face as Marty DiBergi introduces us to his film.  The new digital transfer is fairly clean.  Dirt and grain is noticeable sometimes during the film, but for this feature you really can't complain.  The picture is sharp and surpasses any previous release.  The colors, especially during the concert footage are also a noticeable improvement over any previous release.  This DVD transfer is the best version of Spinal Tap you will find.  The picture is far from poor and will be pleasing to most viewers.  There is no choice of audio formats on this DVD, but the sound was fairly clean.  It sounds great on 2 speaker set-ups and of course sounds better on surround sound set-ups.  The production track is dated, but overall pleasing for this type of film.  The dated production track will not at all affect the overall experience of the film.  It still sounded acceptably clean.  The music track sounds like it has been improved, sounding much cleaner then the production track, and opening up in ambiance and atmosphere a great deal during concert scenes.  In conclusion, if you are a fan of this film, the music, the craziness and silliness, then this release of ""This is Spinal Tap"" is a MUST HAVE DVD.  The menu design and navigation are excellent, and the technical aspects of the disc are quite pleasing.  ""This is Spinal Tap"" is a very funny and entertaining film.  Turn your receiver up to 11 and enjoy this DVD!",973900800,10,3828,4.707831325301205
182449,5,1559408758,"All right.  I know the band has said this in interviews, but this film, while it has some great concert footage and some typically wise interviews, is a travesty of the facts.  Marty DiBergi - whoever he is - went out of his way to present the guys in the worst possible light.  So they got lost on the way to the stage in Cleveland; that could happen to anybody!  Nigel's complaints about the bread being the wrong size for the luncheon meat will be familiar to anyone who's had to deal with low-quality caterers.  When Derek got stuck inside the pod during ""Rock'n'Roll Creation"", that wasn't funny at all, that was very serious.  He could have suffocated in there, or at least got dangerously sweaty.
Another thing that you probably all had a good chuckle at was the bit when Nigel's radio mike picked up the air traffic control.  Well, that scene galvanised the music industry into providing proper screening for wireless systems, which goes to show how one man's tragedy can help the whole business.  It's yin and, what's that other one, yang.  That's it.
The good thing about the film is that we get to see the Tap in all their concert glory, although I personally could have used more of Nigel's guitar/violin virtuosity.  (Jimmy Page was a pussy - he only used the bow.  Nigel used the whole violin.  That's imagination for you.)  But I don't think it was right to show the ""Stonehenge"" debacle.  It wasn't Nigel's fault that he doesn't know feet from inches.  If that designer had been any good, she'd have known that Stonehenge is considerably larger than even a tall dwarf.  Also, the archive stuff is great, and a reminder of how musicianly the Tap has always been, even in their early incarnations.
So why did I give it five stars?  Because, flawed as it is, it's still the only full-length documentary about a seminal band.  Do I mean seminal?  Is that how you spell it?  Probably.  And it's nice to see that they've stayed in the limelight, and sorted out the pod problems, and generally kept breaking like the wind.  Because pods can put you off touring, and touring is the Tap's life blood, or maybe their spinal fluid.  Yeah.  So I recommend this film to anyone who likes to boogie.  Remember - the sun never sweats.
But enough of my yakkin'.",973641600,23,2260,4.562189054726368
182450,5,1559408758,"This movie is easily one of the top ten comedies of the past century. It also happens to be the directorial debut of Rob Reiner (well known to all previously as ""All in the Family""'s Michael ""Meat-Head"" Stivic). Combining the talents of Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest (all by this time Saturday Night Live alums), the movie becomes a rock ""mockumentary""! Reiner also stars as rock journalist Chuck DiBergi, who follows the fictitious English band, Spinal Tap, through a series of mishaps and misadventures. The movie's stabs at rock musicians' behavior hit the mark consistently; all the posing, pomposity and self-importance displayed by any flock of hare-brained and hirsute rock stars are wonderfully lampooned by the trio of aging, obsolescent musicians known as Spinal Tap. The songs are all laughably insipid and full of misplaced testosterone. You'll be able to see the parallels with real rock acts: The girlfriend of David St. Hubbins (McKean) assumes a managerial position by proxy after a series of concert mishaps, mirroring the supposed meddling of Yoko Ono with the Beatles; the elaborate stage sets of Iron Maiden, which never seem to work the way they did for Maiden; the inexplicable deaths of drummers, like those that ended the careers of The Who and Led Zeppelin; and lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel's (Guest's) poke at Zep's Jimmy Page's solos by rubbing a puny fiddle against his electric axe. You'll roar with laughter at bassist Derek Smalls' (Harry Shearer's) inability to get out of a ""star chamber"" on stage, trying to play his instrument in a cramped position while stage hands frantically try to pry him out of his shell. Lines like ""This one goes to eleven"" and ""Hello, Cleveland!"" are still classics. With Tap's rapid decline ending in the ultimate nadir, having a puppet show gain first priority on a festival marquee, we're left with only one question: Will the band bow out gracefully, or continue to wallow in self-destruction? Enjoy this special edition of a comedy great. Also, be sure to look for such screen-comedy luminaries as Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Howard Hesseman, and Dana Carvey as a mime!",973555200,3,2156,5.058988764044944

My good friend and fellow movie geek Brian picked up a copy of the much sought after Criterion Collection version of this film, the immortal Spinal Tap, a few days before the blasted thing was ripped from the retailers shelves due to legal mumbo-jumbo. I could have killed him, I coveted that DVD for so long, so many sleepless nights, wanting it to be mine, all mine! And now, much to his chagrin, I can own the EXACT SAME THING, if not a better version for a fraction of what that rare copy cost. Sure, the now out-of-print Criterion version might be worth a ton of dough in the future, but, hey, I want the movie for the MOVIE. And this very special edition delivers the goods.
The hours of extras, the photo gallery, the videos, and THE COMMENTARY that has Guest and crew in their Tap roles commenting on the terrible depiction of the band as idiots without a clue, when they are so much more than that. It is hilarious and an excellent companion to a film that needs nothing to help it earn its place as a comedy classic.
Yes, Spinal Tap, the first true ""mockumentary"" is a wonderful piece of filmmaking. It is funny and it ROCKS.

This movie is a well-known classic - and it's long standing amongst fans of the movie almost mimics the fan base of the fictional 'Tap' band in the movie!  I loved every minute of this video - Rob Reiner's incisive view of the rock and roll world was right on target - and even many 'old rockers' kid about being compared to 'Spinal Tap' (most recently, Yes and Iron Maiden to name a few - the old rockers get a kick out of it too!) I cannot help bringing up classic lines from this vid when the time is right.  I think Rob really did some homework and did a great job in doing a video that really could have been pretty bad if approached differently.
It is hard to fully catch the quality and fun that is what 'This is Spinal Tap' is - what is great is that I feel it is a movie that anyone could enjoy it - not just a music nut (like me).  Turn this up to 11 (thanks to the new remastering, and with some DUBLY thrown in for sure :) and enjoy this classic all over again.",971308800,2,1170,4.078260869565217

Spawning a slew of ripoffs and inspiring some pretty well stylized movies, Bob Roberts and Boogie Nights to name a few, the mockumentary format in the hands of directors less capable than Rob Reiner has been ridden into the ground.  From start to finish the fab four manage to make constant (ugh...) jerks! of themselves.  Co-written by the cast I image it was as much fun for them to make as it is for us to watch.  Christopher Guest (Jamie Lee Curtis' husband if you're interested) and Michael McKean have the most prominant roles as a pair of guitarists (that's right, two lead guitarists) playing in a down-on-their-luck band called, you guested it - Spinal Tap.  They wale out some of the most side-splittingly funny songs ever captured on tape and during one performance find themselves playing amdist midgets and an eighteen inch model of Stone Hinge, you've gotta see it to realize how funny it actually is.  Maybe the best part of this DVD is the commentary track by the band, playing it in character and equally funny now as they were sixteen years ago.

182462,4,1559408758,"An aging, fading British rock group is touring America, and on hand to document the occasion is a filmmaker who has been blown away by their sound since the first time he heard them; and the result is offered up here for the perusal of all, in ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" without question the best feature length parody of a rock band ever made, directed by Rob Reiner.  When the band returns to the U.S. to promote their latest album, ""Smell The Glove,"" director Marty DiBergi (Reiner)  accompanies them on tour, conducting interviews and taping performances, in an effort to get it all down for posterity.  And get it all he does; the highs and lows, the drama and pathos, the words, wisdom and witticisms of this legendary rock group.  It's all here, and we owe it all to a man of incredible intuition, imagination and foresight, Marty DiBergi.  But, with all seriousness aside, folks...  When this film was released in 1984, it was fresh and new, cutting edge satire that seemed almost outrageous and scathingly intemperate; and to some extent, it still does today.  The difference now, however, is that the times have caught up to and surpassed the parody of the movie.  By anyone's standards, much of this film now seems quite tame, though the subject of the satire remains every bit as relevant today as it did then.  The interviews, conducted and delivered with such dry humor and subtle wit, readily withstand the test of time and are as funny now as ever; but the songs, especially the lyrics, pale now somewhat in the wake of such acts as Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Slipknot, Monster Magnet, System Of A Down, Coal Chamber, Pantera and Alice In Chains (just to mention a few), all of whom in reality have gone far beyond the parameters set by Spinal Tap.  And with today's accessibility to such a wide variety of groups and music via MTV, MTVX, VH-1 and all the other myriad cable connections, it's simply taken the ""sting"" out of the impact of the film.  Like science fiction that has become science fact, our culture and society has contextually changed it's frame of reference, which of course must change the way we perceive a film like ""Spinal Tap.""  What can never change is the quality of the overall movie, the precision of the satire, and the caliber of the performances and direction.  With genuine sincerity, Reiner/DiBergi delivers a truly believable ""Rockumentary.""  His pace and timing are impeccable, and his eye for detail is thorough (though much of it will be lost on today's generation).  The performances are first rate all around:  Michael McKean, totally credible as David St. Hubbins (lead guitar, vocals), possibly the best character he's ever done; Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel (lead guitar, vocals); Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls (bass, vocals); and, of course Reiner, who""is"" DeBergi.  Also turning in notable performances are Bruno Kirby (Tommy Pischedda), R.J. Parnell (Mick Shrimpton, drummer), David Kaff (Viv Savage, keyboards, vocals), Tony Hendra (Ian Faith), Fran Drescher (Bobbi Flekman), and Patrick Macnee (Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg).  Though it may have lost some of it's edge due to changing times, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" will forever remain a milestone in cinematic history.  The songs may be dated but the humor is timeless; this is top-notch satire, and the parody set the standard in the rock genre for those who followed, like Weird Al Yankovic.  The appeal of this film is going to vary from generation to generation, and it follows that the level of appreciation is going to vary; but the fact will always remain that this is a unique movie that succinctly captures the spirit and essence of an entire era.

I had seen this thing twice before, but had forgotten just how funny it was.  Easily my favorite movie of all time.
The great thing about Tap is that the actors never jab you in the ribs and laugh at the characters along with you - an act of treason too often seen in comedy.  They could have easily gone over the top and turned the film into The Naked Gun or Airplane (funny films in their own way, but not at all sharp satire), but their restraint in handling their characters and the story makes the movie.
The songs are not hilarious becuase they are Weird Al- or Spike Jones-style novelty items; they are hilarious because they are incredibly close to what they satirize.  Those things are funniest which come nearest their intended targets, and Tap is consistently dead-on without whacking you over the head with the jokes.
This is not ""serious"" satire (Doctor Strangelove, etc.) that has some huge point to make about society.  It is a brilliant skewering of rock and roll, executed with the perfect blend of creativity, insanity, and restraint.  It makes me laugh until I pee myself every time I watch it.

This is a very good film in the same kind of satirical spirit as the Pythons. It's not the same as Python humor, but very similar. This is a great film with many funny moments.
However, the best part of this new DVD release is the special features. Tons of great special features! These special features are what you are really buying the DVD for. You get over an hour of additional footage that does not appear in the film. This additional footage is great stuff. Some of it should have been used in the actual film.
You also get a humorous inteview with the director, Rob Reiner, who has gone on to direct many successful films. The DVD also provides 4 music videos: Listen to the Flower People, Tonight, I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight, etc.
However, by far the best special feature is the audio commentary by the Tapsters: Derek, Nigel and David. The actors are in character while doing the audio commentary. Great stuff. Watching the movie with the new audio commentary is awesome. It's like a whole new Tap movie! Great idea on their parts. In the end, you get over 1 hour and 45 minutes of bunus footage and special extras.

That said, I can't help but express my disappointment in this film.  I've never seen it prior to renting the Criterion DVD, and I've gone years hearing about how wonderful and hilarious this film was.  I've seen ""Waiting for Guffman"", which was for most intents a spiritual successor to ""This is Spinal Tap"". With that in mind, I sat down to watch Spinal Tap.
As I said above, the film had a few nice moments. But for the most part, the jokes are stale and you see them coming a MILE away. Perhaps in 1982 this boat would float, but not in the year 2000. I'm not a big Monty Python fan, but I did find ""Waiting for Guffman"" INFINITELY superior to this film. Guffman is more sophisticated, more clever, and much more taut as a comedy.  Enduring a horrible 5 minute song just to harvest a few High School-calibre sex jokes is not my idea of good comedy, and This is Spinal Tap is NOT good comedy. All 3 lead actors do a competent job, the directing is nice, but the film is short on content. Too many songs, far too few backstage antics. It makes you wonder if we're actually supposed to be enjoying the music.

Not only  does the disc booklet not list the film's last three chapters, but the film  itself lacks the original on-screen captions identifying characters,  places, etc., thus making itself more bewildering.  (For some reason, a Tap  clip played during Rob Reiner's new interview has the clip's original  caption.)  Did the filmmakers intentionally remove the captions for this  rerelease?

The  extra footage on most DVD re-issues is usually pretty much just throwaway  stuff; however, on this DVD, there is at least a full hour of outtakes that  are almost all as funny as the parts that did end up in the film.  The  outtake scene involving the temporary replacement guitarist they got when  Nigel left the band is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.  It's  almost as if they included an alternate ""Spinal Tap"" movie with  different scenes and different jokes.  The extra scenes show how the final  cut of the movie removed all groupie/drug use scenes, all the more reason  to prize this annotated collection.  The music videos, press conferences,  commercials, and other rarities are awesome.

The seriousness dead-pan nature of the band's attempts to  make it big are so hilarious that you laugh at the escapades they take in  recreating a come back of their former (lack of) glory.  Picture a garage  band that never really made it, try to recapture the glory of never making  it. The songs are musically excellent, and like the rest of the movie, it's  acting and script (and improv)are hilarious in how closely they parody real  bands.  We laugh because we are watching a rock group self-destruct, but  everyone but the group iteself knows that it is happening.  The difference  between these guys and current day musical fabrications like the Backseat  Boys and In Stink, bastions of current lows in musicdom,is that these guys  parody those that aggrandize themselves.

The characters are hilarious and the lyrics of the songs are even  funnier. It's a tribute to their talent that alot of these songs sound  quite good! There's actually a small treat of brief appearances of famous  people in several scenes.

They also run into a series of problems, like  losing their way back stage and not able to find the stage. I highly  recommend this to any garage band.

This  parody of a 70's/80's rock band feels so absurd and realistic that members  of Aerosmith credit it with causing their epiphany that forced them to get  clean -- when the saw it they realized, even if it wasn't a direct parody  of them, it was close enough.

182486,5,1559408758,"Spinal Tap remains one of legendary bands of the 70's and 80's, having provided us with a sound that resonates through to the present in the somewhat hamhanded aspirations of groups like Metallica and the rest of the  alternative music scene.  I feel lucky to have been able to follow Tufnel,  St. Hubbins, and the  tempestuously incomparable Smalls closely through  their early gigging in the LA clubs to the Stonehenge tour and beyond.  Absolutely noone displays the same raw sexual energy as Nigel rockin' on  ""Big Bottom"", backed up by the tight background of David, Derek,  and the drummer.
My only regret is that, like Hendrix and the Beatles  before them, Spinal Tap had fallen prey to the destructive infighting,  backbiting, spontaneous combustion, and drug and alcohol indulgence that's  taken the bloom from so, so many rock super-groups of our time.  Luckily,  my thorough archive of records, remastered gold CDs, memorabilia, and THIS  DOCUMENTARY are my solace through a sometimes dark future of rank  imitators.

MGM Home Entertainment notes that the 1984 rock comedy, about a fictitious over the hill heavy metal band on their comeback tour, will re-released on VHS and DVD after being out of print for several years. The new special edition home video versions of the film will boast new audio commentary from the cast, an hour's worth of deleted scenes, beefed up sound and video, and more. Some of the goodies turned up on a This Is Spinal Tap CD-ROM that surfaced in the early '90s and later on the first DVD version, but this new release will be different in many ways.  Most notably, the new version will feature entirely new audio commentary.  The previous DVD featured the cast members commenting out of character, this time actors Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest will offer commentary in character (as David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls, and Nigel Tufnel, respectively).",960163200,38,1099,5.0

First of all, this is one of the funniest, most original movies ever.  The team  of Michael McCean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer prove a winning  combination.  A great deal of the script was improvised and is filled with  subtle laughs.  It's an incredibly accurate look at the inner politics of a  rock band.
What makes it even better is the ton of extras.  Included on  side two of this DVD is about an hour of grainy bits from the cutting room  floor.  It has feature length commentary by the whole cast, a music video,  and tons of insight on the making of this comedy classic.

Rob Reiner, along with the men of Tap, have created a masterpiece of rock and roll humor.  Incredibly funny, the story of the  Smell the Glove tour by the aging rock band Spinal Tap pokes fun at all the  prior ""rockumentaries"", while providing some suprisingly decent  music too.
Interviews with the band, live concert footage, flashbacks  and behind the scenes of a working rock band, this movie has it all, and it  is all funny.  This is a brilliantly witty take on those way too serious  rock bands who think that we really need to know all about them.
I  hesitate to call the movie well written, as I understand there was quite a  bit of ad-libbing going on. Nonetheless, the actors do a great job of bring  to life the characters that make up one of the loudest rock bands of all  time.  Supporting roles by Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Fran Drecsher, Doug  Squires and Paul Shaffer add even more to this extraoridinarily funny  cast.
Plus, from ""Come on, Mime is money"" to ""This one  goes to eleven"", this movie is full of great movie lines that you will  be quoting to friends for years to come.
A previous reviewing indicates  this will soon be rereleased.  Not a minute too soon.  If I borrow my  friends copy one more time, I may suffer the fate of any of the number of  Tap drummers.
