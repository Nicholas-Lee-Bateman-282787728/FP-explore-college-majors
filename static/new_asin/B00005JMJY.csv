1492448,5,B00005JMJY,"back in the 80s there were these rather ambitious albeit inane and silly action sci-fi horror movies...like: My Science Project, Buckaroo Banzai, Night Of The Creeps? well this film has what many of those other films have. i'm not sure what to call it...but it has that deliberate sens of fun, that joyfulness and faith that the makers had in what they were producing. and it really shows in the final product. something very 80s and awesome about this. and yeh it never answers any questions we may have after viewing. wooo!",1074902400,3,525,4.717391304347826
1492449,3,B00005JMJY,"This movie is definitely cool.  The band (Guitar Wolf) is also cool.  Fun stuff.  Campy cool.  But...well there is not exactly as much zombie action as I thought.  But that's not my main gripe. What really stopped this from being a total killer movie is the use of CGI!  Yes, all (and I mean all) of the gunshots to the zombies are CGI!  It especially look bad when the shot is to the zombie's head (about 96% of the shots).  Man, why did they do this?  Other than the CGI the movie kicks.  But it's really distracting because it looks like a rockin' Romaroesque romp one second and a cartoon another.  Still, it does not totally kill the movie but man, what a mistake.",1074211200,9,669,4.314516129032258
1492450,5,B00005JMJY,"Wild Zero cracks my top 5 list of zaniest films I've ever seen.  This Japanese movie combines flying saucers, flesh-eating zombies, gender-bending love scenes and a sleazy music promoter wearing the tightest shorts known to man.  All of this laced with powerhouse punk music and buckets of sloppy gore.  The movie stars the 3 members of real-life Japanese punk band ""Guitar Wolf"", whose music is an irresistible blend of hardcore, rockabilly and surf garage.  It also has some of the coolest features ever packaged on a DVD, such as behind-the-scenes looks, a Guitar Wolf discography and Bio and an interactive drinking game.  I won't go into too much detail about how that game works but let's just say that anyone who chooses that option is likely to be tanked way before the film reaches the halfway mark.
The film opens up at a Guitar Wolf concert where we meet Ace, a young fan who follows the band on tour.  After the show, Ace inadvertently saves the life of the lead singer who was caught in a shootout with a lowlife music promoter (the one who wears the tight spandex shorts).  As a reward for his good deed Guitar Wolf give Ace a magic whistle and tell him to blow it if he is ever in trouble.  As Ace hits the road on the way to the next Guitar Wolf gig, a meteorite crashes into the town of the next show, turning all inhabitants into zombies.  It is now up to Ace and the members of Guitar Wolf to save humanity in the name of Rock and Roll.
The film never takes itself seriously and for this reason the cheese and lapses of taste can easily be forgiven.  With movies like these, self-parody is often the only way of being effective and if Wild Zero took itself seriously in any way, it would easily reach the botom of the cinematic pile.  Instad, the undercurrent of self-ridicule and over-the-top comedy works beautifully.  One thing I found surprising was the amount of zombie action in the film.  I figured the zombies would only be a backdrop within the overall nuttiness but instead zombies are pretty much present throughout the entire film. It's just that they are never really scary or to be taken as more than laugh fodder.  The paranoia of 28 days later or the claustrophobia and social commentary of Romero's films are entirely absent.  Although zombies appear throughout the entire film, Wild Zero cannot be considered a true zombie film any more than From Dusk Till Dawn would be considered a true vampire film.  But if you liked Dusk, you'll love Wild Zero.
Although the concept is ludicrous Wild Zero is major fun from beginning to end.  In my opinion, this is the most entertaining rock band film ever, edging out classics such as Rock n' Roll high school and A hard day's Night.  Not in quality but in sheer entertainment value.  The best scenes are easily the ones where Ace blows his whistle and Guitar Wolf appear to save the day and lend Ace some of their philosophies such as ""Ace! True love knows no boundaries, color or gender! ROCK AND ROLL!.""  That one phrase pretty much sums up the underlying message of the entire film.  Wild Zero also serves as a commentary on greedy producers and sharks in the music industry who try to stiffle the creativity and artistic freedom of musicians signed under their labels.  Well, Guitar Wolf just ain't gonna have that!",1072396800,10,3297,4.6
1492451,5,B00005JMJY,"If you're looking for something fun...something filled with zombies, aliens, Japanese punkabillies and rock n' roll, well then, sh*t, you're either looking for Wild Zero or you're a weirdo. Freak.
Wild Zero's fun and craziness. A young Japanese man obsessed with the punk rock n' roll band, Guitar Wolf, gets thrown into a world full of aliens, zombies, cross dressing club owners and love regardless of several inch long body parts. Helping him along the way is Seiji, Toru and Billy, the three members of the greatest band ever, Guitar Wolf. They don't say much, but what they do is pure gold.
The leather jacket wearing, Kawasaki with flames for exhaust-riding rockers show up to kick ass, rock and just be cool. Quite frankly, I'd kill to be able to do either one of the three, but 'cause I can't, I loved every single second of this movie. From it's outrageous dialougue, over-the-top bad special effects and downright fun of it all, I don't think I can watch this movie enough.
If you're a fan of campy sci-fi/horror, Japanese craziness or the spirit of sweaty, greasy rock n' roll..or just have ADD, buy this. Ten bucks says you'll be buying a tube of pomade within a week.",1072310400,9,1180,4.705314009661835
1492452,5,B00005JMJY,"I bought this about two years or so ago on Ebay (bootleg) and its been one of my favorite b-movie zombie flicks EVER SINCE! My friends don't love this movie like I do, but I don't care. This movie is totally awesome and rediculous! Oh yeah. Guitar Wolf ROCKS LIKE A MUTHA!
Ok, the story starts with UFOs flying towards the earth (you own't see them again until the end of the movie) and our hero, ACE, in his room rockin' out and coming his hair. He goes to see his favorite band, Guitar Wolf, and mayhem insues. He and Guitar Wolf (the singer/guitarist) become rock 'n' roll blood brothers, and whenever Ace is in trouble, the band comes to the rescue. Tons of zombies appear, a gender-bending ""lady friend"", whom Ace falls for, and lots of rock 'n' roll and exploding zombie heads. The only thing wrong with this movie is that all the head pops are CGI animation, but the movie more than makes up for it in pure wakiness!!
Anyone who likes Japanese movies/music, or just wants to see a fun zombie/punk rock flick, I highly recommend you buy this. If you enjoy it, you're awesome. But if you don't, well, that's your loss.

The story is about a young rockabilly punker named Ace who is following his favorite band, Guitar Wolf, on tour.  Ace passes through a town where a meteorite recently fell and causes the inhabitants to change into zombies and it is up to Guitar Wolf to save the day with their magic powers of rock and roll.

wild zero is an excellent horror/b movie and your not so average love story. i love this movie for its ridiculous characters and their antics. it's wildly inventive, but the japanese have a habit of creating insane scenarios so you can never expect the ordinary from them. if you like low-budget flicks, zombies, and a good laugh- buy it! and remember the words of guitar wolf: love has no race, nationality, or gender.",1059696000,6,765,4.7164179104477615

As if zombies weren't bad enough, Ace is left to deal with some unusual girlfriend troubles, while the boys in the band are forced to face off with a crazed club owner. Mayhem and madness reign supreme in WILD ZERO, the off-the-wall Horror Comedy that stars trash rockers Guitar Wolf as the super-powered versions of themselves. With non-stop action from start to finish, WILD ZERO packs in more head explosions, hair-combing, and outright hilarity that any other zombie film out of Japan. This makes it easier to overlook some of the computerized gore considering the unserious nature of the film and the endless amount of blood that are being spray across the screen. Director Tetsuro Takeuchi is sure to include a ton of top-rate make-up effects as well, which call back to Tom Savini's blue-skinned monsters from George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD. All of the makings of a cult-classic can be found in one place as Ace and the gang defend the Earth using the power of Rock 'N Roll!

1492613,5,B00005JMJY,"Not only am I a fan of the entire horror genre, I am especially fond of Asian horror films. At this point, with upwards of two-hundred zombie films in my extensive collection, I consider myself fairly knowledgeable on the subject. And that is why I would like to share a few words on the film ""Wild Zero,"" which in all seriousness is hands down one of the best Asian zombie films, EVER! I mean, if you're an Asian zombie film enthusiast and have seen the likes of, say, ""Sars Wars: Bangkok Zombie Crisis,"" ""Tokyo Zombie,"" ""Junk,"" ""Zombie Hunter Rika,"" Onechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad,"" ""Zombie Self Defense Force,"" ""Stacy,"" or ""Versus,"" then you know that they make a damn fine zombie flick. In the case of ""Wild Zero,"" however, the not only pushed the envelope, they made a brilliant rock'n'roll zombie film that is destined to become a Cult Classic. After all, when you have an alien invasion, hordes of flesh-hungry zombies, strange and colorful characters, a transvestite as the love interest of the protagonist, weird but effective humor, and the Japanese punk and maximum rock'n'roll legends Guitar Wolf both acting and rockin' the house, you have a movie meant expressly for the margins of the underground film society, as well as a film that has achieved instant greatness! Take it from me, this is one that you'll watch again and again. I know I have.",1293753600,,1362,4.8
1492614,5,B00005JMJY,"All zombie films are, of course, fantasies in that they're purely fictional.  But this film conjures up a sense of ""fantasy"" deeper than merely a depiction of fictitious characters and events.  It evokes a sense of wonderment and magic - almost like some mythological tale of ancient gods -  made manifest primarily through the persona of Guitar Wolf, the film's star and the catalyst through which an almost supernatural salvation occurs.  True, Ace is technically the main character of the film; but he exists primarily as a kind of high priest who's been given the ability to summon the protection of his Rock 'n Roll idol, Guitar Wolf.  And, when summoned to save Ace and his ""girlfriend"" Tobio from the zombies, Guitar Wolf not only saves his blood brother, who had earlier saved Guitar Wolf from his unscrupulous agent - one of the best conceived villains ever; but, almost as an afterthought, saves the world itself from an imminent alien invasion.  These aliens, whose spaceships have engorged the night skies everywhere, were somehow responsible for the zombies in the first place.  The message of the film - loud and clear - is that ""Rock 'n Roll is not dead!"" - at least not as long as Guitar Wolf lives.  Had Ace not believed this with his entire being, the story would have died stillborn in the very first reel; but Rock 'n Roll saves the day both for the film's main characters and its viewers.  Any way you look at it, this is one fantastic movie.",1275609600,,1463,4.68359375

1492697,3,B00005JMJY,"WILD ZERO (2000) is living proof just how weird, oddly brilliant (at the same time stupid) and outrageously cheesy Japanese films can be. Granted this style of filmmaking is not for everyone. This film pretty much has everything from zombies, aliens, rock & roll, super powered rock stars, zombie and transgender love...There's crowbar brutality, bazooka abuse, razor-sharp laser targeting GUITAR picks, electrical eyebeams and a gun-slinging shower scene...The film is NOT to be taken seriously, as the plot lacks structure, characters look like they're rejects from ""Grease"" but for some unbelievable reason, it all manages to click together. WHAT THE HECK?!

Synopsis derived from dvd back cover:
ACE (Masashi Endo), a rockabilly fan who really wants to be cool, is on his way to see his favorite rock band; Guitar Wolf, when a strange thing occurs...aliens invade the earth and people start returning to life as flesh-eating zombies! Enlisting the aid of the real-life Japanese punk/rock band Guitar Wolf, Ace and the members of the band get entangled with many misadventures with insane managers in tight shorts, transsexuals, naked women shooting guns in the shower and blood-thirsty zombies ready to tear them apart!

The one thing that stands out in the film are its characters. They are all underdeveloped but in their own way very colorful and interesting. If you pay attention to their mannerisms and costumes, you'll figure out just what they're all about. Seems like everyone has a purpose; from Masao with the butterfly knives, to the woman in the shower, to the Yakuza gang, from Guitar Wolf up to the lead; Ace. It seems like everyone in the film wants their share of screen time and everyone has a subplot. The events linking all the bizarre incidents all share their own credibility.

Now, this is not an action film so don't expect it to be one or you'll be disappointed. The film is slow-paced in the beginning until it reaches its second half. It's no ""Versus""; the film is pretty much a satirical horror film that makes fun of itself. It is meant to be different and the film manages to stand on its own with its very unique style. It exaggerates smaller things with the action, acting and the special effects itself is a bit over-the-top. The EFX is cheesy and campy as was its intention. If you saw ""SARS WARS Bangkok Zombie Crisis"", you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The zombies pretty much look like rejects from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video with a bluish color that is so vibrant to once again exaggerate the stereotypical appearance of the ""undead"". The zombies also move much like the ones in ""Night of the Living Dead"" (it was even mentioned), slow-moving, shambling dead ""things"".

Cool poses, a lot of hair gel and combing, this is a Japanese film so expect another play on philosophy based on courage and Rock and Roll. Love has no boundaries not even death or gender; it has zombies making out and transgender love. The best way to see this film is to approach it without any expectations and do not pay any attention to other reviewers who say that it has non-stop zombie action. There is quite a bit of blood and gore, brains are brutally blown away and innards of the zombies' victims are eaten on camera. Again, the movie tends to exaggerate, so they all end up looking cheesy and stupidly amusing (?). Of course, no film like this would survive without a few ""splattering blood"" effects.

If you want to see something totally over-the-top with utter silliness and oddball humor; then you may be ready for ""Wild Zero"". The film isn't going to win any awards but hey, it may be the ultimate Asian Cult film; I'm sure some folks will like it while others will hate it. The film does require a very large suspension of disbelief. Director and writer Tetsuro Takeuchi knew exactly what he wanted to do, film a movie to make fun of itself and to pay tribute to the self-proclaimed coolest rock band in the world; Guitar Wolf...again, it is all a matter of exaggeration.

I started watching this movioe twice but only made it in about 20 minutes before I turned it off and gave up. A friend urged me to give it one more shot and I did and fell in love with it. So if you watch it, give it more than 20 minutes, it becomes really funny/interesting/cool.

Wild Zero is kind of like Kiss Meets The Phantom of the Park combined with a Japanese version of The Ramones stuck in a Zombies From Outter Space story. Yes, it's quite a combo. Oh and throw in a love story, some renegade gang members, and a club owner with really short-shorts and you've got it. I love the music in this film, Guitar Wolf rocks.

Plot Summary:  A Japanese Rock and Roll Wannabe (Ace), complete with black leather jacket and motorcycle, happens to be in a small town in Japan that just happens to be ground zero for an alien invasion, via zombies.  Along the way the band Guitar Wolf, a corrupt manager, an gunrunner/mercenary, and 3 slackers wander through the film.  Armed with nothing more than his wits (such as they are) and the ""love of rock and roll"" Ace has to defend civilization (or at least one cute girl) from the zombies.  Over the course of the film the zombies eat people, get shot in the head, show a degree of mobility and intelligence that varies from ""potted plant"" to ""low normal,"" and generally behave the way anyone who has ever seen a post-Romero zombie film would expect them to.  The alien invasion aspect of the film is pretty much just a plot device to explain the zombies and all we ever see of them is their ships flying past.

Review:  (Warning, this review contains a ""Spoiler"")  This had the potential to be a nice little zombie movie.  Unfortunately, ""Wild Zero"" decides that we need a ""message"".  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't think that having my horror movie ""spiked"" with the director's punk rock, free love, down with capitalism, and the power of rock and roll philosophy improved anything.

Bottom Line:  This movie is for hardcore zombie move enthusiasts (if you just have to complete your collection and/or you really want to see a bunch of zombie heads exploding - this is the film for you) and fans of Japanese punk rock only.  For a much better, albeit still low budget, zombie film check out ""Hide and Creep"" or if you want big money polish and special effects in your zombie movies check out the Romero classics and the recent remake.",1187049600,4,1933,4.578488372093023

Continuity, logic, and to some extent--taste---seems to have been thrown out the window in favour of a lot of fire, explosions, screaming and melodramatic expressions.

1492704,2,B00005JMJY,"Wild Zero (Tetsuro Takeuchi, 2000)

Imagine what would happen if you crossed the video for Michael Jackson's ""Thriller,"" the wonderfully bad new wave film Get Crazy!, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger flick, then added a dash or two of Hedwig and the Angry Inch. The result would look a whole lot like Wild Zero.

Takeuchi (who, according to IMDB, had never previously directed, nor had since directed, another movie) gives us a ninety-minute hero-worship session for Guitar Wolf, a band who have the distinction of having been in the Guinness Book of World Records for loudest record of all time (Jet Generation). The story revolves around Ace, a young guy who idolizes Guitar Wolf. After he saves them from a corrupt manager, Ace (Masashi Endo) and Guitar Wolf (playing himself, of course) for a kind of bond, expressed through a whistle Wolf gives to Ace to blow if he's ever in trouble and needs the band to come help him. Meanwhile, in the desert, a large meteorite has fallen to earth, and a number of people who have never met are coming together at a small gas station convenience store. (They do this so we can meet them all, and then have an excuse to follow their stories, most of which never intertwine again.) Yes, the two storylines do eventually come together; Ace meets one of the folks from the gas station, hitchhiker Tobio ([name censored... because yes, you can't say it here]), and falls instantly in love. Not a good thing to do when you're about to face... eh, I'll let you find out for yourself.

Wild Zero is an incredibly silly movie, but if you like that sort of thing, you'll get ninety minutes of enjoyment out of it. There's no portion of the flick that hasn't been done better somewhere else, but all the elements have never been juxtaposed quite like this before. And it does have a good soundtrack. **",1133308800,8,1829,4.656346749226006
1492785,5,B00005JMJY,"If you're into stuff like[...](and why wouldn't you be, for gods sake) this is your movie. Never has there been such an unrestrained indulgence in all things that are awesome. This goes beyond the self-conscious spoof or the hapless low-budget B-movie, into its own realm of pure KICKASS. Every guitar player should probably own this dvd. There is a drinking game included in the special features, or at least there is on my copy. And let's just say, Guitar Wolf's climactic defeat of the UFOs is possibly the most amazing thing ever put on film.

ps. when ace discovers ""the truth"" about Tobio, make sure you pause the dvd to catch the little graphic that flashes. too funny",1131580800,8,675,4.720338983050848
1492786,4,B00005JMJY,"There is a lot going on in this movie to be honest.  Your main character is a guy who idolized the punk group Guitar Wolf (Actual Japanese group), who is also a part of the movie.  You also have a hot female arms dealer, a couple who falls in love later on, a club owner who is...weird in his short shorts, and a girl *snicker* who is the love interest of the main character.  Yes, this is a zombie movie.  A gorey flesh eating zombie movie with a lot plots going on.  I added it to my zombie movie simple because it's a fun-to-watch movie.  If you are looking for a zombie movie where you can tell they had a lot of fun making it, then this would be a good one to watch as well.  Biozombie is another asian zombie movie to check out as well. :)",1120953600,3,745,3.9932432432432434
1492787,5,B00005JMJY,"Yes, since The Beatles made ""Help!"". And we're talking about movies, NOT concert footage or documentaries, so I don't want to hear about ""Stop Making Sense"". Or ""Gimme Shelter"", ""Woodstock"", or even ""Bring On the Night"". And don't even think about bringing up ""Rock and Roll High School"". This is IT. This is THE ONE. ""Wild Zero"" could just have easily been made in the '50s (at 50+, I'm speaking from experience): UFOs, zombies, motorcycles, leather, and the Big Beat. And though it features a soliloquy worthy of Olivier by the amiable goofball ""Ace"" (just before taking a crowbar to a boat-load of zombies), it isn't Art, and doesn't pretend to be. What it is (man), is Fun with a capital F, from start to finish, and that is what rock and roll was always supposed to be about.",1118793600,6,780,4.618705035971223
1492788,5,B00005JMJY,"Night of the Living Dead meets Rock 'n' Roll High School, this film's giddy energy and unrepentantly silly story line are a hoot and a holler of fun. Guitar Wolf, along with his bandmates Drum Wolf and Bass Wolf (all three of whom were reportedly blind drunk during the length of the shoot), make for convincing punk rock superheroes; in one scene Guitar Wolf dispatches with a gaggle of zombies with a hail of flying guitar picks, while in another he cleaves a UFO with a samurai sword stashed in the fret of his trusty instrument. Other characters, such as Makoto Inamiya's womanizing lounge-lizard villain and Haruka Nakajo as a sexy bazooka-wielding assassin, are equally pungent and delightfully bizarre. Shot in Thailand, the film's army of the undead was reportedly played by Thai military staff and their families. While not a film for the Steel Magnolias crowd, Wild Zero is an exuberantly weird and entertaining flick that is totally enjoyable and  a fun movie to watch.",1118534400,3,980,4.903614457831325
1492789,2,B00005JMJY,"Only one word describes this movies and its "" CHEESE "".

 1- Two zombies fall in love,  2-when people are  near zombies, the zombies seem to just walk around them doing nothing in most scenes, 3-these guys are like 80's chinese cheese balls, I love the 80's but the japanese made a new style movie but it seems like they are stuck in the 80's walking around yelling "" ROCK AND ROLL "" lol just stupid as hell. 4- Also all the gore is animated which i didn't like at all. If you want a good Zombie flick  check out Junk or even Versus ( both Japanese cinema ), i would advise Junk its an excellent movie. Versus just drags to much but is still more fun than wild zero, which I will never watch again.",1111276800,3,698,4.102941176470588
1492790,5,B00005JMJY,"Hey now, this is MY kind of movie, rock'n'roll, zombies, space aliens, boy meets girl.....well, sort of.  This one trashy fun wild ride of a movie, in my opinion.  First off the heros of the film are the Japenese band Guitar Wolf, who are kind of like a more punky raw version of Motorhead, for want of a better description.  And there's Guitar Wolf fan Ace, a 50's looking rock'n'roller with the 'do and all.  This is about an alien invasion turning earth people into zombies, you never get to see the aliens but their spaceships are cool.  This has all kinds of great music in the background too, from Surf to The Zero's doing ""Wild Weekend"".  Guitar Wolf himself, while an unlikely hero, does it with style and NEVER changes expression once throughout the movie, which is pretty amusing in itself.  For fans of rock'n'roll trash zombie cinema, you can't beat this.  I loved every minute of it.  HIGHLY recommended.",1106352000,2,917,4.645962732919255
1492791,3,B00005JMJY,"I saw this movie during a ""whatever we got"" timeslot in a convention video room some time around 2am, which actually is how I think it is probably best viewed.

To quote one of my friends who experienced this with me: ""Someday I'm going to either start crying or vomitting and while I might not realize it at the time, subconciously it will be because I watched Wild Zero.""

To quote Guitar Wolf: ""BLOOD! BLOOD! EXPLODING BLOOD!""

Take from this what you will. I'm not even sure how to try passing a judgment on this. It's one of those rare things that simply ""is"". You should go into this being informed that it involves rock'n'roll and zombies. For my part, I regret nothing.",1102982400,7,677,4.487804878048781

1492793,5,B00005JMJY,"This movie has it all; zombies with exploding heads, plenty of guns, naked chicks, naked guys, (only chests are visible) love interests, Rock and Roll, aliens, guys combing their hair, guitars with weapons, and a really good time.  Despite being a zombie flick the gore in this film is kept to an incredibly tasteful minimum; I've played fighting games with more guts.
This is what ""KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park"" should have been, and any other movie in which zombies explode and Rock and Roll saves the earth.  Ace, Guitar Wolf's biggest fan, assists them and becomes a Rock and Roll blood brother.  The next day, he meets a girl and is attacked by zombies.  There's no plot as to WHY the zombies or the aliens are there; invasion, accident, first contact?  Who really cares, however, when you've got true love to save and Rock and Roll to spread?
I'm inclined to place this in my Comedy section, but it fits Sci-Fi quite well: it's not scary, so Horror is out.  If you love Rock and Roll, zombies, or just plain cheesy-good movies that are a blast to watch with friends (this includes a drinking game!)
