808739,5,6304197632,"Ever since I read The Diary of Anne Frank as a child I have always wanted to know about the girl behind the book, and Anne Frank Remembered is perfect for that purpose.  Narrated by Kenneth Branagh, with selected readings from Anne's diary by Glenn Close, this video paints a haunting, heartbreaking portrait of one of Hitler's most famous victims through the personal reminiscences of her surviving friends as well as others who survived the Nazi death camps.  There are excerpts from interviews with the late Otto Frank, Anne's father, as well as interviews with Miep Gies (the woman who supplied the Secret Annex as well as keeping it and its occupants hidden from the SS), Hanneli Goslar (Anne's friend), and Peter Pfeffer (son of dentist Fritz Pfeffer, who was also in the Secret Annex), among many others.  They all paint a picture of a young girl who was just on the brink of womanhood when she died, and who had a lot of hope for the future.  Anne was the typical obnoxious youngster, and yet when one listens to the words of Miep Gies and others who knew her well, their words combine with the images on the video to show that Anne was so much more than what she seemed to be on the surface--forced by circumstance to grow up before her time, but at the same time able to retain that youthful hope.
Watch the video by itself, or read The Diary of Anne Frank and then watch the video--Anne Frank Remembered will stick in your mind for a long time.",1046304000,25,1455,4.5
808740,5,6304197632,"Anne Frank Remembered's greatest strength is in it's interviews.  From Otto Frank (a interview conducted in 1976) to Miep Gies this documentary really brings Anne Frank from a name, face and diary to an actual person. The video also shows some great history and background, and many more interviews; her cousin Bernd, people who knew both her and Otto in various concentration camps.  And also her friend Hanneli Goslar (nicknamed Lies at school) and a brief meeting (the one and only I think) between Fritz Pfeffer's (Albert Dussel in the diary) son and Miep Gies.  This video does feature the only know moving footage of Anne herself, I learned about that by reading the other reviews here.  An excellent documentary, but it is best to have at least read her diary first, and also good to have a bit of general knowledge about everyone involved(helpers and resident's of the Secret Annex), and maybe what they looked like in the '40's because some of them are featured in this documentary.",1030752000,11,991,4.846153846153846
808741,5,6304197632,"Anne Frank Remembered was definately the best video of Anne Frank I've seen so far. I found myself watching in complete awe and silence as I saw Otto Frank, Miep Gies, and countless other people who knew Anne Frank speak of their times with Anne. This documentary is amazing. The mixture of the music, photos, and Glen Close reading quotes from Anne's diary give it feeling. The closing scene that shows the only known moving footage of Anne was breathtaking and left me with tears in my eyes.",1006473600,4,493,4.613636363636363
808742,5,6304197632,"The first time I saw ""Anne Frank Remembered"" was actually in a Sacramento cinema called the Red Lion. The audience was so moved by this movie that they sat in silence the entire time, leaving quietly as the ending credits rolled. I have not seen an audience react to a film in this manner before or since, not even to ""Schindler's List"". To say the least, Jon Blair's rendering of Anne's life is authentic, respectful and honest. A fitting tribute to Anne and the victims of the Holocaust.",998956800,3,489,4.568181818181818
808743,5,6304197632,"I visited the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam this summer and watched this video when I came home.

Our 8th graders read the play, but this video would be a lot more enlightening to them.",996192000,,290,4.490566037735849
808824,5,6304197632,"This is a moving documentary/tribute to Miss Anne Frank. Her diary was intended to show the world that Anne, her family and the others that were in hiding with her were human beings despite the hatred of the Nazis and anyone else not mentioned. I procrastinated viewing this tribute but I finally saw it. Her diary was meant to be found purposely because it showed the world through all the bedlam and chaos, again, those persecuted are human beings. There are no other views to it. And I had read her diary in high school and have decided that I will probably purchase the book when I am able to and re-read but this time I can see the real faces behind the words.",1474416000,,665,4.370967741935484

808830,5,6304197632,So incredibly enlightening. I was not aware of her life in hiding or when she was in the concentration camps. I have never really been interested in learning about her.

808832,5,6304197632,"In my opinion, this book is a must-read along with Anne Frank's diary. It rounds out the people and situations mentioned, as well as being completely inspirational.

808833,4,6304197632,"Anne Frank is best known as the young German Dutch Jewish girl who kept a diary of her life in Amsterdam before and during the hiding from the Nazis in World War II. Anne Frank was a real person and beloved by everybody who came in contact with her. It was easy to fall in love with Anne whether from her precious personal intimate diary or her story. Anne Frank had inspired to become a journalist and writer but she never lived to see those dreams. She was robbed and so was the world of her gift of observation, compassion, and joie de vivre.

When you watch this documentary, you can't help but fall for Anne Frank. She was described best by her childhood friends as lively, mischievous, funny, and alive among her friends during that difficult time. In almost two hours, you learn a lot about Anne's life in Germany and later in the Netherlands and sadly her demise at Bergen Belsen concentration camp where she died with her sister Margot and mother Edith. Her father Otto Frank would survive the camps and learned his family's demise.

This two hour documentary includes interviews with Anne's childhood friends from Amsterdam; the legendary Miep Gies who helped hide them behind the bookcase; a tour of the infamous attic; and a touching moment when Miep meets Peter Pfeffer (son of Fritz Pfeffer, the dentist) for the first and only time. Peter died two months after the meeting from cancer. Miep was a remarkable Dutch woman who risked her life to save them for two years.

The two hour documentary takes the viewers to the concentration camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Westerbork where Dutch Jews were sent upon arrest, and Bergen Belsen. Anne's diary had taken a life of its own in film and stage adaptation all over the world. Anne Frank's life was cut short but she touched everybody who knew her alive and even after death. There is also an actual shot of Anne before the war in Amsterdam in a rare scene from 1930s home movies.

If I have one complaint, there is no extra special features to accommodate this remarkable documentary.",1458432000,,2045,4.6722222222222225

808903,5,6304197632,"With honesty, witnesses recount their experiences at the hand of the Nazi regime. So very painful, they all had one thing in common.
They understood that we carry our history with us and they all were quite determined to speak the truth about a time full of the worst organized crimes imaginable.
Unearthing details I'd never heard, I've no idea how to react... a mixture of grief, anger, a desire to somehow honor these people mixed with profound sadness. I don't regret watching this film... I just believe it will take a long while to assimilate.",1456617600,,549,4.729166666666667

809055,5,6304197632,"The movie is wonderful, but we should have thought the ending through before playing this for our young granddaughters, who came for a sleepover. They began to ask what would happen if Anne and her family were caught. Uh oh. We distracted them with other things so they would lose interest. Then we turned it off. Our granddaughters are 7, 9, and 11. Perhaps we will try this again when they are a few years older.",1421020800,,414,4.4605263157894735

I am a conspiracy theorist at heart and have been for as long as I can remember thanks to my father. This documentary was very interesting, I have recently been swallowing any information I can dealing with the Holocaust and along with this I ordered Shoah and the BBC mini series Auschwitz. I have yet to see either of them, due to time constraints. I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in Anne Frank or the struggle of people during WW2. Superfluous as it may be, I got the disturbing notion Miep was being coached in her responses throughout her interviews. Again, a conspiracy theorist at heart.",1390521600,,712,4.5271317829457365

My daughter is six and was able to watch this and she really enjoyed it and felt a special bond with Anne.  Some parts were a little hard to follow for her but she didn't lose interest and we were able to explain to her.  She really like how they showed pictures of actual places and the rooms.

It was wonderful to see Miep in person (a face to the name), describing Anne and the other persons hidden in the Secret Annexe!  Though it was very difficult, I was esp interested in the seeing the camps where Anne & her family were sent to after their capture and where she ultimately died (I couldn't stop crying), which for obvious reasons the details are not included in her diary.

Viewing the historical context or actual setting was eye-opening for my students; from Amsterdam to the rooms in the Secret Annex--all of it was interesting to them.  The abundance of Frank family pictures also intrigued them and made this family real to them.  The historical footage brought the Holocaust into perspective as well.

If you are interested in Anne Frank's story, and a history buff like my daughter, it's a must see. It's fascinating albeit kind of eerie, as well as awfully sad, to see the footage of the hideaway and to hear the remarks of the various people involved.",1349654400,,398,4.391891891891892
809239,5,6304197632,"The first half is interesting, mostly interviews with friends and
neighbors of the Franks before and during their time in hiding. But so
much of that basic material is familiar to any who have read the diary,
or know the play that there were few revelations, and I wasn't sure
what the fuss was about.

But it is the second half of the film, that fills in with tremendous
detail what happened to Anne and her family and friends after they were
discovered, and after the diary ends that is overwhelmingly powerful.

I've struggled with many films and books about the Holocaust. It's all
almost too much for the mind to take in, reducing human suffering to
insane numbers, or piles of dead bodies that the brain can set up a
sort of emotional firewall around. That's why the most powerful piece
of art about the holocaust I'd encountered before this was Elie
Wiesel's ""Night"" - by reducing the nightmare to one specific young
boy's experience I could finally feel the emotional impact of the fact
that all these numbers and photos of mass graves were real human
beings.

'Anne Frank Remembered' has that same kind of power; by focusing the
holocaust to one family's very specific experience, it paradoxically
makes the enormity of all the suffering real and present.

And yet, like Anne Frank herself, this documentary, while
overwhelmingly sad, also sees the good in people. As much as I wept
(and boy did I weep) at the cruelty and death, I also wept at the
courage and love shown by the friends and family who kept Anne alive,
and the survivors who carry the memories of those who survived and
chose to still embrace the world instead of running and hiding. How I
wish I had that kind of courage and strength.

A truly important document of the human experience.",1348185600,,1763,4.637820512820513

This includes but is not limited to Government and the Real Estate Business, as well as so many other facets of life. However, race also includes religion and how so many diverse entities choose to worship the Lord. For this matter, I am specifically referring to the Jewish Community, who for years has been scrutinized for no legitimate reason whatsoever, accept but to demonstrate power and prowess dominance over another group of unsuspecting human beings. The counter forms of racism have proven to be detrimental to society as a whole, and this documentary does its very best to expose the very intricate form of unrelentless hate against a group of people who have never ever done anything wrong to anyone, accept be who they are, Jewish - the chosen ones. This video is an amazing educational piece to use in the classroom to teach children how the many demonstrations of unnecessary hate can tear apart the human being mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally.",1342310400,,1150,4.963730569948186
809241,5,6304197632,"My first exposure to Anne Frank's diary was as a thirteen-year-old boy in the eighth grade when I first read excerpts in our English class.  Prior to this, I had a vague knowledge that she was a teen-aged Jewish girl who had perished under that devil Hitler's reign of terror, and had kept a diary while in hiding.  Her black and white photo, solemn with haunting dark eyes, had occasionally gazed out at me in bookstores from the cover of the Pocket Book edition of ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"".  These selected entries were riveting, and made me want to read the entire diary, which I did shortly thereafter.  It was a page-turner, I was very impressed with Anne's nascent talent and skill as a writer, but this was leavened with a heavy sadness knowing the malevolent fate that stalked and ultimately destroyed her.  The unfathomable evil and transcendent horror of the Holocaust was revealed to me with a gut wrenching awful clarity that sickened and disturbed me for several days.  It was hard to come to terms with the fact that this genocide was going on in this ""enlightened"" twentieth century, and such a short time ago!  I read it in 1967; just 22 years after the World War II had ended, it boggled my mind.

Reading Anne's diary which only encompassed two years of her all too brief life, piqued my curiosity to know more about her, and over the years I read several excellent books about her which told of her life before and after she went into hiding.  Also, I had read the Pulitzer Prize winning play ""The Diary of Anne Frank"", and viewed the 1959 George Stevens film adaption of the same.  Finally I had read in 1995 a new edition of the diary called ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl - the Definitive Edition"", that included approximately thirty percent of new material that Anne's father Otto Frank had excluded from the original edition.  This documentary was released the same year, and reading this most recent edition first is excellent prep work before viewing the film.

In both versions, Anne becomes more of a flesh and blood human being, a normal teenager and less the shining icon.  Her flaws as well as her virtues are revealed, which doesn't lessen our appreciation or admiration, but rather augments it.  The tragically short trajectory of her life's journey that began and ended in Germany is presented as thoroughly as possible.  Especially valuable are reminiscences by two of Anne's best friends both of who are familiar to readers of the diary, Hanneli Goslar who was given the alias of ""Lies Goosens"" and Jacqueline van Maarsen who was renamed ""Jopie van der Waal"".  Particularly moving is Mrs. Goslar's recollection of the final meeting of Anne and she separated on opposite sides of a barbed wire fence one bitter dark night in the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp shortly before Anne's death.  This is a cruel contrast to an earlier happier memory of Anne and she running to hug one another on their first day of kindergarten at the Montessori school in Amsterdam.

Generous, deserved appreciation is given to that remarkable woman Miep Gies, who was the sole survivor of the quartet that hid and took care of the Franks, van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer for two years in the ""Secret Annex"".  This white haired, grandmotherly woman was a true heroine, remarkable for her sterling character and courage.  Besides putting her husband Jan's and her lives on the line in hiding the group in the ""Secret Annex"", she courageously went to Gestapo headquarters in Amsterdam to try to negotiate the release of the Franks and the others after the arrest.  Sadly, she was unsuccessful, but it was she who saved Anne's diary and writings from the tender mercies of the Nazis just after the raid and kept them locked in her desk awaiting Anne's return.  Her participation is invaluable as one of the few remaining eyewitnesses, perhaps the key one.  There is a touching vignette where Mrs. Gies meets Peter Pfeffer, the son of Fritz Pfeffer for the first time, and he thanks her for all she did for his father.

The narration is well done by Kenneth Branagh clearly modulated but somber given the gravity of the events.  However, the choice of Glenn Close to read passages from Anne's diary is unfortunate, her voice is obviously that of a mature woman, unsuitable for a young girl, better choices would have been Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder or Natalie Portman who would play the role in a Broadway revival a few years later.  The cinematography is excellent through the use of computer graphics; the now empty rooms of the ""Secret Annex"" are suddenly transformed into a reasonable facsimile of what it looked like when occupied.  Conversely, there is footage of the entrance to Auschwitz, and the infamous railroad and cattle car shot is the dead of a moonless night lit only by a sweeping searchlight that chills the blood, it's haunted by the ghosts of the innocents murdered there.

To wind this up, through photographs and interviews including those with Otto Frank, Anne's father, the viewer gets as close to knowing the real Anne Frank as is possible all these many years later.  Deservedly it was rewarded with an Academy Award for Best Documentary of 1995, and was fittingly accepted by Miep Gies in addition to producer/director Jon Blair.  It's excellently done, but in the last half disturbing and harrowing particularly from the betrayal to the awful end when all but Mr. Frank would perish in the various concentration camps.  Yet as in the diary, Anne's soaring spirit ultimately triumphs.  The final moments shows the only known filmed footage of Anne from 1941 as the camera fleetingly captures her, and Branagh quotes her for the last time.  The title of this review is part of the quote, and kind of proves the old adage ""be careful what you wish for"".  Anne Frank lives on all these years later through her legacy as a gifted writer, but at what a terrible cost.",1329091200,2,5923,4.751953125
809242,5,6304197632,"I thought this video documentary with Miep Gies, was a very insightful tribute to not only a girl, but a time in history that should never be forgotten or misunderstood.  Some of the other videos or movies about Anne Frank's life, although may be well done, they are ""Hollywood-ized"" and don't always give us the
true sense of what she, her family, and others who lived this tragedy went through on a daily basis.  Since it was told by one of those that hid her, Miep Gies, and those that lived it,the documentary leads us down the pathway of a factual understanding and not someone's interpretation.  I would recommend it.",1309046400,,623,4.6454545454545455
809243,5,6304197632,"The interviews with Anne's friends, the pictures of Anne's family, the survivors of the camps she was in who shared their experiences...incredibly powerful stuff. But what brought me to tears was Peter Pepper's first and only meeting with Miep. It was astonishing how Miep was so matter-of-fact about everything, she was truly an amazing human being. And Peter's whispered ""Many thanks"" had me sobbing uncontrollably, especially upon hearing he died two months later. (And I know his father was waiting for him in Heaven, his arms held wide open to embrace his son after some 50 years apart)

Another devastating portion was Lies Goslar's belief that had Anne known that her father was still alive, she very well may have been able to muster an inner reserve and fight. It might be wishful thinking on my part, but I have to wonder how much the absolute will to live can turn the tide of a disease intent on removing that will.

The one question I would love to have answered before I die will always be, who was the betrayer. I know Otto Frank has actually said himself he bore no ill will towards Karl Silberbauer, because he was doing his job. But it was a different story for the monster who stole these 8 innocent people from us. Hannah Goslar was right. Anne could have really given something to the world.

809245,5,6304197632,"And so begins Anne Frank Remembered, a beautifully crafted in-depth look at the life, death, and timeless appeal of a young Jewish girl who wished to ""live on even after my death."" Filmmaker Jon Blair paints a fuller picture of who Anne Frank really was by interviewing some of the people who knew her best including childhood friends Hanneli Goslar and Jaqueline van Maarsen. Both describe the girl as a social butterfly whose very presence demanded attention and never backed down when it came to speaking her mind. Hanneli recalls a famous saying her mother made about Anne: ""God knows everything, but Anne knows everything better!""

She was feisty, fun loving, and sometimes bossy. Much different than her proper, quieter sister Margot. A family friend remembers how different the Frank parents were when it came to disciplining their children. Mother Edith was the no nonsense type that scolded Anne whenever she drew negative attention to herself, but Papa Otto saw her as the apple of his eye and allowed her to be a free spirit.

Much detail is given to the tightening vise of the anti-Jewish Nazi laws and the dreaded call-up that led to the Frank's decision to go into hiding. Otto's employees including the young Miep Gies took the dangerous tasks of hiding the family (as well as the Van Pels and dentist Fritz Pfeffer). Nearing 85 at the time of her interview, Miep recalls the daily task of supplying food and other goods to those in hiding and the constant fear of discovery. Her English wasn't the best, but her occasional use of bad grammar and long pauses make her more endearing. Her meeting with Dr. Pfeffer's son Peter is so moving and real. Unfortunately he passed away after a long battle with cancer shortly afterward. Speaking of Pfeffer, those who've read the diary are already familiar with Anne's many run-ins with the seemingly stern man. Little did she know that both shared a common love of life and freedom nearly stifled by their cramped quarters.

Fellow captives Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper and Rachel van Amerongen-Frankfoorder share their memories of the days following the arrests of those in the Secret Annex to the transit camp Westerbork and death camps Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, where Anne briefly reunited with friend Hanneli on the other side of a fence. Hanneli wonders out loud if Anne might've fought harder to survive if she'd known her father hadn't been gassed on arrival at Auschwitz. Sadly Otto was the only survivor and Miep handed over his daughter's diary only after she'd learned the girl wasn't coming back. She hated being called a hero, but what she did was truly heroic and without her Anne's diary would've been lost forever. The last part of the film covers the diary's publication and the impact it continues to make to this very day.

The most striking scene is of 12 year old Anne leaning on her balcony watching a wedding take place on the street below. The clip lasts only seven seconds yet it cements the fact that she was a real flesh and blood girl who had no idea of how her short life would end or the legacy she'd leave behind.",1283385600,3,3103,4.794392523364486
809246,5,6304197632,"This is the riviting, true and tragic story of Anne Frank -- the impish, mischievious, talented, wise, and ultimately the terribly tragic victim of circumstances. She did not live to see her dreams cf fame and fortune come true -- but she has, in death, become a symbol for the 10 million people who so needlessly died in the concentration camps of World War II.  Their talents, as Anne's talents, died with them -- a loss to their surviving families, their surviving friends -- and humanity at large.  Anne's gift was writing, and observation at what she wrote.  She was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.  So, sadly, were all the myriad other victims....

Kenneth Branagh and Glenn Close, (who reads excerpts from Anne's Diary),narrate the film -- with objectivity and yet with tenderness and, when required, a barely-controlled, yet justified anger. This, as well as 1st-person, eye-witness words of those who knew Anne, bring her short, brilliant, and tragic existence so very vividly to life.  Prejudice, sadly, has SO very, very many faces -- and I am sure that there are SOME people who might think that only Jewish people could give this disc the narration that it deserves.  With feeling and rightous anger, with empathic and almost psychic feeling for those involved, Glenn Close and Kenneth Branagh -- neither one being Jewish -- show that Anne's death, and those of all the other victims, was not just a Jewish tragedy, but, far more, a Human one, as well.

This DVD tells her story simply, truely, and without undue sentimentality.  As the saying goes, this DVD tells it like it was...and is.  Those who knew Anne, and who survived the war, are interviewed.  Meip Guies, the secretary who not only hid the Franks, but visited them every day, is seen here, as is Anne's male cousin, who lived in Switzerland during WWII.  A very moving scene comes when the son of the dentist who stayed with the Franks, meets his father's protector, (Ms. Guies), for the first time.  Interviews with Anne's school friends, and the friends she made and met in the two concentration camps, and one transit camp, she was in, are also given.  One of these women had to tell Otto Frank, at the end of the war, that she had seen his daughters die, and she explains what happened at that emotional meeting.

Anne Frank's ""secret annex"" has been turned into a museum, and this DVD gives a tour of the surprisingly spacious hiding place.  We see the small room with two beds in it that Anne and her sister Margot slept in, the movie-star pictures, and pictures of Royalty, with which Anne decorated the walls, the dining room, and the rest of the apartment.  Also shown are the steps up to the secret hiding place, and the small bookcase, with books, that hid the ""secret-annex"" from the Nazis.  At least for a while.

The before-the-war, early, free days, and transit-camp and concentration-camp experiences of Anne, and the other seven people who hid, are discussed by eye-witness survivors -- often Anne's ""normal world"" friends, who were taken, as well.  They describe a girl who was not perfect -- but who had a sense of fun, of mischief, and a growing, and enormous writing talent.  The suit of Holocaust-deniers, to prove the diary a fake, is aslo gone into, and the ultimate verdict -- that the diary is truly genuine, is also noted.  Watching these eye-witnesses, one cannot help but realize that history is being shown before one's eyes.....  (In passing, I must report that Jerry Springer, TV host and former Cincinatti mayor, gave the best counter the sadly perennial queston: ""Did the Holocaust ever happen?""  I believe he had been interwiewing neo-Nazis on his program, and, in the speech he always gives at the end of each show, mentioned this question.  Mr. Springer looked non-plussed a moent, then said these classic words: ""If the Holocaust -never happened...then what happened to all my aunts and uncles?""

How Anne's diary was turned into a book, a play, and a film are also discussed.  The copyright date of this DVD is 1995 -- so the wrenching TV-drama, ""Anne Frank -- the Whole Story"", had not yet been produced.  Nor, of course, the upcoming, (2010), Masterpiece Classics version of the Diary.

I have often though that the ""Nazi"" party was very-well named -- unintentioanlly well-named, at least for those who speak English. In English, the word ""Nazi"" is pronouched ""Nat-see"", (or perhaps this is a translitertion from the German).  Indeed, the ""Nat-sees"" did ""NOT see"" humanity for what it really is -- a group of widely differing INDIVIDUALS, who do, (or, usually, do NOT), bear simularities to those in their own families...not to mention those within their national groups.  No one is an EXACT duplicate of anyone else, after all.  And who, anyway, deserves deprivation, slavery and death only because of their nationality? Obviously -- NO ONE!  But the Nazis, (""Nat-sees""), didn't see this.  If one is UNABLE to see, and is blind, that is a personal, and very deep tragedy, though many sightless people have bravely countered this, and have shown us all what courage is and can be.  But it is very, very, VERY different from one WILL ""Nat-see"". that is either a personal choice, or one is a victim of stealty propaganda.  Either way, this is not only a personal tragedy, in that one loses one's ability to THINK clearly and for one's self, but, if enough people become of the ""Nat-see"" persuasion, it becomes also a national tragedy -- for themselves, and, sadly, for so many others.

Nazis, past, (and sadly, present as well), speak of ""the Master race"". But if one believes in the Bible, one realizes that He created only TWO people, Adam and Eve -- and that ALL humanity is descended from those two people, only! All people, also, have the same basic body structure, inside and out....and the same basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, love, appreciation, accomplishment, etc.  Further -- from reading about Anne Frank's personality -- that she was intensely interested in Royalty, that she was extremely impatient, and that she knew, inwardly, that EVERY human being has worth, value, and something to give to the world -- I begin to wonder if she was, indeed, an ""Indigo"" person.  Indigos --in present-day, ""New Age"" philosophy, have thse characteristics, and some others, as hallmarks.  And, in present-day, ""New AGe"" philosophy, these ""Indigo peeople"" are supposed to be the next stage in Human evolution! If this is so, as I believe it is, then Anne Frank was the future -- the Nazis, with their deadly and communicable prejudicial ideas, stereotyping, their violence, pitilessness, ruthlessness, unchecked militarism, and meglomania, were definitely of the past...showing the worst that humanity offered, from caveman to middle-ages.  To, sadly, even now....

Playful, resourceful, mischievous and ever-curious Anne would have loved computers.  She also would be, I think, very proud of this DVD and how it now availabe f0r playing for anyone with access to a computer. It is a sad story, but if enough people view it, it will be one force to show people living now, and in the future, of a horrible period in Humankind's history, and help to prevent it happening, to any group of people, ever again.

809320,5,6304197632,"""Anne Frank Remembered"" is a well-compiled documentary that provides deep insights -  into the life of Anne Frank, the famous diarist who recorded her experiences as a Jew in hiding with her family and acquaintances in Nazi-occupied Holland, of her life before going into hiding, insights into her character as gleaned through interviews with her childhood friends and acquiantances,  as well as portraying the horrific events that led to the Final Solution, i.e. the Holocaust [ film reels of Jews being persecuted & deported, scenes of concentration camps etc].

The documentary is narrated by Kenneth Branagh and excerpts from the diary are read by Glenn Close. It begins with a close look at Anne's background prior to her going into hiding with her family. Anne's family are German Jews, and Anne's father Otto actually served as an officer in the German Army during WW I. However, when Hitler came to power in 1933, his virulent anti-semitism motivates the Franks to leave Germany - most go to neutral Switzerland but Otto takes his wife Edith, and daughters Margot and Anne to Holland where he has business connections.

Through some insightful and candid interviews with Anne's childhood friends and acquiantances such as Hanneli Goslar and also Miep Gies [one of the Dutch Gentiles that helped the Frank family whilst they were in hiding], we discover Anne's natural tendency to be the center of attention, her precociousness and outspokenness.

When the Nazis invade Holland, Otto Frank decides his family should go into hiding - and arrangements are made for them to hide with the Van Pels' at the office where Otto used to conduct his business. When Margot receives a deportation order, the Franks' go into immediate hiding, giving outsiders the impression they left for Switzerland.

Once in hiding, Anne pours out her innermost thoughts and feelings to her prized confidante - her diary [a present from Otto on her 13th birthday]. Contained within the diary are Anne's intimate thoughts on the pains and joys of adolescence, her dreams and her frustrations, especially with her mother [whom Anne felt didn't really understand her] and also Mr ""Dussel"" [the dentist Mr Pfeffer]. It was quite a revelation to listen to Mr Pfeffer's son disagree with Anne's unflattering portrayal of his father in the diary. It was also poignant to see this grown man tear up and thank Miep Gies for helping his father go into hiding.

The latter half of the documentary attempts to reconstruct the events that occurred after the Franks and the rest were captured by the Gestapo - their brief stint in prison before being sent off to Westerbork [a transit camp] and finally deported to Auschwitz and other concentration camps. The retelling of the tragic fates that befell these innocent people is heartwrenching indeed.

The final scene that has stayed with me is of Anne watching a wedding from her apartment window - it is the only moving footage of Anne that has remained till this day...though brief, it captures this young girl in a moment in time when she was filled with all those childhood dreams, and still untouched by the tragic events that were soon to follow. It serves as a poignant reminder of what might have been had this lovely young woman lived to realise her full potential. ""Anne Frank Remembered"" is a must-watch documentary for students of history and for anyone with an interest in Anne or the Holocaust.",1233273600,,3424,4.963350785340314

A similiar sensation overcame me when I saw this neccessary though not entirely satisfying film about her life, and indeed, does so whenever the subject of Anne Frank is broached.
 But then, why shouldn't it? After all, though it may seem self-evident, the story of Anne Frank is without doubt one of the most tragic of the twentieth-century. Here was a precious human soul, bright, gifted and energetic, literally bursting at the seams with promise and potential, a person whose life was cut short by forces beyond her control. The death of Anne Frank was, in every possible sense of the word, senseless. Her murder, and by extension that of roughly six million equally innocent lives, constitute an inestimable loss.

Anne Frank is gone.

She should not be.

This must never happen again.

But then, who can?

809450,5,6304197632,"Although some viewers may take second-hand accounts of ""naughtiness"" at face value, Anne Frank's exuberance as a little girl is that which is often seen in gifted babies and young children, an indication of of an active mind; that Anne became a gifted writer is no accident.

The film itself is breathtakingly real. That such a precious child should have been treated by the Nazis in such a horribly unhuman manner is unthinkable to those who have any shred of human decency. That anyone should be treated in such a brutal manner by virtue of their ethnicity, religion, color or creed, is  inhumanity at its lowest depths and should never, ever happen again.

Even though she says she was just being a human being, Miep Gies was a heroine for hiding the Franks, the Van Pelses and the dentist. She was a courageous and kind woman who, like Anne Frank herself, serves as a model of the highest caliber for humanity to follow. Otto Frank also served as an important role model for his parenting methods, for allowing the child Anne to be herself and to grow in her own way.

If it hadn't been for the Nazi holocaust, Anne and her sister, along with the others, would have been free to live and let live, and Anne would have undoubtedly become one of the most prolific and inspiring writers of all time, traveling the globe and meeting the movie stars whose photos she still has pasted on the walls of the Anne Frank museum.
Shame on the Nazis for curtailing and making an actual, living hell of this beautiful little girl's life and depriving her, her loved ones, other Jews, and the other targets of German fascism of their freedom, well-being and happiness.

Thank you for this film which is a testament to caring and kind and courageous people like Miep Gies and fellow travelers,without whom this world would be a dreadful place indeed.

809451,5,6304197632,"Young, rascally Anne Frank, if not for the extraordinary circumstances of her life, may have grown up to be a writer, a movie star, or any of the other thousand things she dreamed and fantasized about, as any adolescent girl does. Instead, she has become an icon, a symbol of hope, and an inspiration to millions of people around the world who have suffered under the hands of despotism and fear. This DVD serves as a documentary, and tribute, to this amazing girls life.
Directed by Jon Blair, who previously produced a documentary on the life of Oskar Schindler, brings his skills and expertise to bringing to life the life of Anne and her family as they first flee Germany to set up her home in Amsterdam, and then, to flee into hiding once German invades the Netherlands.  As told through the eyes of her childhood friends, Anne is precocious, impish and fun.  Interviews with Lies Gosslar and others provide first hand accounts about her, and make her real and authentic, not grandios or distorted, as the tendency may be for someone as famous as Anne. This documentary also doesn't shy away from Anne's burgeoning sexuality and her feelings about her adolscence, which provides a more complete picture of this girl.
The documentary moves into the Frank family needing to hide from the Nazis in their Secret Annex, and we meet the impressive Miep Gies, who sustained the people living there for two years. The footage of Miep in the Annex itself was astounding, and her testimony honest and compelling. A scene in which the son of Fritz Pfeffer, the Jewish dentist who also hid in the Secret Annex, meets Miep in Annex itself reduced me to tears in an instant; kudos to Blair for making this reunion happen and capture it on film. Amazing cinema.
What I appreciated most about this documentary occurs after everyone in captured from the Annex and forced into the hands of the Nazis. Blair painstakingly recounts the final months of the Franks lives, which in past documentaries seems to be rushed over. Blair brings Jewish survivors who knew the Franks back to the camps they were imprisoned in, and shared their experiences. The effect is chilling, and allows us to truly understand the last months of Anne's life more than I ever have before. He brings back Lies to talk about being with Anne during her last few days; incredible.
Also amazing, Blair digging up a very brief movie clip of Anne herself, leaning out the window watching a wedding happen on her street. The twelve year old girl becomes even more alive as we see her, hair blowing in the wind, looking up and behind her, not knowing what her fate will be in just a few years.
Anne Frank so longed to be known around the world, dreaming of becoming a famous writer, and even began to prepare her diary for publication after the war. While she never lived to see that occur, her legacy and gift to the world, through her inspirational words, remains with us today. And this documentary serves as an excellent tribute to her short, short life.",1079136000,87,3010,4.688090737240076

I cannot top the other reviewers descriptions, they cover it all so very well, except to add that if anyone is dedicated to keeping the holocaust alive in history, and has any dedication to the ShoahFoundation, then yes by all means, get this documentary. It was wonderful to see Anne's childhood friends in this, who knew her, and to hear Miep speak of those days and all they endured. This was real, not any Hollywood contrived script. As an avid collector of realistic documentaries of history, this one is one of the very best.",1066780800,12,629,4.675675675675675
809453,5,6304197632,"As I have only recently purchased this excellent videotape, I had already viewed ABC-TV's 2001 presentation of ""Anne Frank"".  I have also read - in depth - several books on Hitler's most famous victim in addition to the protagonist's own diary.  Therefore, the dramatic impact of most of ""Anne Frank Remembered"" was diluted slightly.  However, its merits and its poignancy cannot be undermined.  The story of Anne Frank's brief, tragic life deserves to be told - and re-told - into the ages.  And who better to tell it than the formidable Miep Gies - the stalwart and trustworthy employee and friend who, with her husband Jan and several others, gave shelter, solace and friendship to the Frank family during their difficult 26 months in hiding.  Gies's halting English does not diminish her power during this video.  Intermittently struggling with pronunciation, she never wavers in dedication, principle and moral courage.  The safekeeping and eventual publication of Anne's diary is the direct result, of course, of Miep's protectiveness and integrity.  Without her, this precious legacy would have been just another plundered treasure in Nazi hands - surely the ultimate violation.  It has been nearly 60 years since the German surrender, but we must never forget the facility with which so many otherwise law-abiding citizens pledged their fealty to a madman's unalloyed evil.  This priceless videotape also contains a very moving testament to the enduring power of goodness.  A pivotal scene in which the son of Fritz Pfeffer (Miep's dentist who resided with the Franks in their hiding place) meets his father's protector for the first time never fails to bring tears.  Already ravaged by the cancer that would take his life shortly after this scene was filmed, the son of a father he barely knew pays noble tribute to the woman who stood strong against tyranny and oppression.  In so doing, she added more than two years to his father's life.  This tender and wrenching scene brings to mind the epilogue from ""The Tribunal,"" an episode of the TV series ""The Outer Limits.""  Sam Egan, the show's producer whose father survived the Holocaust, intoned the following wise and wonderful words:  ""The wounds of war run deep - cutting across generations.  But there is always the hope of healing - so long as there are souls among us whose hearts are more full of love than hate.""  My deepest admiration and praise to the indomitable Miep Gies - and all who were like her - during a time when human fortitude and conscience were put to the ultimate test.",1058400000,11,2554,4.953051643192488
7864722,4,6304197632,"This film is hideously depressing and not at all inspirational--in fact, the script read by Glenn Close is nihilistic and infinitely dark.  It puts on display the Nazi ""mentality"" (for lack of a better word to describe these jack-booted mutants) and the set mousetrap that was the Reich's strategy to remove all ""undesirables"" from Europe. This is NOT the Anne Frank of the Diary. I expect this is what Mr. Blair was aiming for. By the time we find out what became of that poor child, none of us in the audience are buying the clich about people being good at heart. I walked out of the theater overwhelmed with disgust and hatred toward my species, and particularly toward the government of the United States of KKK that allowed such horrors to happen for so long.  The film can be read as a deconstruction of Roosevelt's administration and of the western hemisphere's rabid anti-Semitism. (The late feminist philosopher Andrea Dworkin often pointed out that in the mind of the Reich, Jews had the status of insects, unfit even for slavery; this film is a testament to her statement.)  Not for children or adults prone to nightmares (as I discovered).",1519171200,,1152,4.778894472361809

7864726,5,6304197632,"I recommend this film as a supplement to The Diary.

This documentary skips over much of the time the Frank family spent in hiding, and only very few of Anne's entries are read. More time is spent on the background of the Frank family, and after they were caught.

That being said, from what I know of the story of Anne Frank, this documentary was very accurate; although as it was produced in 1996, there's likely new information that has been released since, but nothing too significant (to the best of my knowledge).

That her diary wasn't the focus didn't bother me by the end, as it was called ""Anne Frank Remembered"" and not the ""Diary of Anne Frank"". Anyone who has read the diary knows what's in it, so I didn't see that as critical. Though I did think they should have mentioned at least once the names that were changed. They repeatedly referenced the ""van Pels"", though in the version of the diary that I recently read (Definitive Edition), the names were changed to ""van Daans"" - this documentary didn't mention the changed name of the van Pel family.

As I said, anyone who read the diary won't have any problems filling in the gaps.

Several survivors and people who either knew Anne or were in the concentration camps are interviewed. There are several short video clips of Otto Frank, Anne's father, speaking.

There were several portions of this doc that focused on the Holocaust generally, without directly tying it to the experience of the Frank family, or her diary. I didn't have a problem with that and I think the film was a great ""tribute"" to Anne.

This film includes a short video of Anne at a window when she was 12 - It was one of the highlights of this film for me. It is an actual ""moving picture"", the only known video of Anne Frank.

One minor thing I didn't like about this film is the speed at which the names appeared and then disappeared from the screen when it was identifying who the speaker or interviewee was.",1496707200,2,1949,4.501416430594901
