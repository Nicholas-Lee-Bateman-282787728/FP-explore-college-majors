 HOW I WAS WRONG.
 Even if u are a psychopath u can't sit around in the whole of movie.
 This was so bad that even the atrocius mattei's cannibal efforts seems like masterpieces compared to this flick.
 To get a clue even one of the worst zombie movies ever made THE 1990 ZOMBIE EXTREME PESTILENCE created by a german amateur director WAS BETTER if this is possible than this flick.

 Really a warning. don't make the mistake i did. u will throw the dvd after 10 minutes or so....
 There is a lot of nudity but nothing further.
 the gore is amateur and makes u laugh.
 the actors should be executed for their performances.
 Instead of a horror movie we got a comedy BUT the worst of the kind.

8674237,1,B00MR9HO10,"Total garbage!  Nothing is remotely believable or plausible.  The film starts with Nazis fleeing Europe at the end of WWII in modern commercial jets and quickly deteriorates from there.  Forget about the bad giant plastic snakes and spiders attacking people in what is obviously the New Jersey woods (I grew up in NJ) devoid of undergrowth and supposed to represent the South American jungle, NONE of the actresses  plays an even remotely believable 1940s woman.  They have modern hairstyles, piercings, and tattoos, including the supposed well nourished concentration camp survivor with an ugly half sleeve tattoo on her left shoulder, but no identification number on her forearm.  You'd think they could find a magic marker and at least add that in for a low buck film shoot.  The Nazis all wear the armbands on the right arm instead of the left and one of them even has Levis pants that are supposed to pass for a party uniform.  This is just bad all around on every level.  It's sole saving grace is the nude women except for the one heavily made up Bride of Frankenstein pseudohottie blonde chick with the cellulite ass.",1477785600,2,1125,4.817708333333333
8674238,5,B00MR9HO10,"This movie is so good I watched it three times before my old lady kicked me out.  The title may be far out, but after watching it you'd understand it's a mockery of cannibals, and does not trivialize the sensitive nature of horrific events you may associate cannibals with.",1462838400,2,273,4.571428571428571

8674240,1,B00MR9HO10,Watched it using my PlayStation. Watching it in fast forward (x1.5 so I could still hear it) made it a little better. Just couldn't stand all the slow motion. Was glad when the movie was over. Only positive was that a couple of the girls were kind of cute but the male Nazi had a weird mask.,1435622400,,291,4.12280701754386
8674241,5,B00MR9HO10,"Bill Zebub, the king of low-budget, indie exploitation is back!  I've been watching his movies for years and this one fantastic. It's a complete absurdist take on the Nazisploitation genre.  The movie stars the lovely indie vixens Erin Brown (Misty Mundae), Vanna Blondelle and Lydia Lael as perfect eye candy ready to be devoured by the indigenous cannibals.  There is ample T&A, gratuitous violence, mesmerizingly absurd slow-motion combat scenes, smarter dialog then you will likely give it credit for. It's really enjoyable.  It's funny and more importantly, you get to see Nazis destroyed. Look, if you are some genre-purist looking for a modern take on the Italian Films of the 70s, this is not it (also loosen up a bit, jeeze).  If you were excited by Annabelle and obnoxious MTV-style modern horror, this definitely is not your movie (please play with a large plastic bag while you're at it).  If you do appreciate guerrilla, indie film making at it's finest, then crack a beer, sit back with some buddies and watch this.  To paraphrase the great Joel Hodgson ""Not everyone will get it, but the right people will"".",1431129600,3,1122,4.9361702127659575

Terrible.... the very lowest
Clearly just an effective way to deceive people who actually want to buy ""Cannibal Holocaust""",1430438400,,153,6.0
8674243,1,B00MR9HO10,Absolutely no redeemable quality to this foolishness.  The positive review is obviously by the person who made it.  An uninspired amateur piece of junk.  Don't waste the 5 minutes it will take for you to turn it off.  Sad to see that Erin Brown has given up on having real film career.  She has real talent but for some strange reason would rather do this crap than take a shot at true acting.,1425427200,7,393,4.328767123287672
8674244,5,B00MR9HO10,"I bought this because of the clever word-reversal of the title (""Cannibal Holocaust"" is one of ht e more famous genre movies).  It was also entertaining to see someone combine Nazisploitation (like the Ilsa movies) with the jungle flicks).  Both of those genres boast nudity, and rather taboo sexual content, and this one had more of that in the first 20 minutes than all of those movies combined!  It was quite a fun ride.  And beautifully shot.",1423699200,3,446,4.753246753246753
