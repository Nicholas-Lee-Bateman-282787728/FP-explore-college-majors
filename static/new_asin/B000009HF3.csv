7905441,3,B000009HF3,"""Mission of Justice"" is by most accounts an above-average action flick, but it misses a higher rating for a handful of poor decisions. This third team-up between action heroes Moon Lee and Yukari Oshima is a fruitful international production with a good pace and a satisfying amount of karate and shootouts, and would have earned four stars were it not for director Tommy Loo's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-Bastard-Swordsman/dp/B0034KYF86/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of Bastard Swordsman</a>) late shift to an unpleasantly dark tone.

The story: Anti-Crime Agency members Moon (Lee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Angels/dp/B0015WAOA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Angels</a>&nbsp;trilogy) and Bullet (Oshima,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Avenging-Quartet/dp/B000DN5VJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Avenging Quartet</a>) travel to Thailand in pursuit of a notorious human trafficker (Betty Mak,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Heat/dp/B00004YS9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Heat</a>) and an ex-guerilla (Tommy Wong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Chinese-Ghost-Story-III/dp/B004LGRDA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Chinese Ghost Story III</a>).

The movie appears to learn as it goes, beginning as an amateurishly-shot piece that definitely overdoes it with the undercranking, but it soon develops a professional look that makes the most of its locations and art direction. Lee and Oshima are curiously played against type: while still extremely tough whirlwinds of kicks and punches, the plot makes them noticeably more feminine (dare I say girly?) than we're used to, and they're beat up more than is their norm. Characters aside, the film is one of the most well-paced of its kind, rarely lagging or bogging itself down with excess dialogue. Things go fine...and then the narrative abruptly forgets about its heroes and focuses on its villains for the final third. While I appreciate the almost experimental tonal shift and the examination of that particular dynamic, this portion of the feature also makes the molestation of women a prominent new theme and features a pair of disturbing rape-murders for no reason but shock value.

The action's a well-balanced blend of shooting and kicking, and does well with both. Many characters are particularly superhuman in their ability to repeatedly flip and roll out of the line of gunfire, but it helps make for some exciting exhibitions - particularly the cramped shootout in Oshima's hotel room. The seven fight scenes are pretty cool, right up until the last few which are inexplicably shot mostly in slow motion. Gary Daniels (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B00008WJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>) makes an appearance for the opening fight against Moon Lee but disappointingly remains dead for the rest of the film. Having Lee and Yukari be more vulnerable as fighters makes for an all the more interesting brawl dynamic, and action director Yuen Bo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-Terminators-2/dp/B000009DX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel Terminators 2</a>) supplies some pretty decent choreography for the performers to show off their athleticism.

There are a lot of neat little touches that make the movie stand out: Chan Lau's introduction as a Tarantino-esque enforcer, those portable telegraph machines, using that enormous cave as a shootout location... Someone less troubled than me by the rape angle would probably agree that these little tidbits should nudge the rating up, which makes it all the more disappointing that those scenes are so unnecessary to the plot. Nevertheless, the overall quality of this B-movie adventure is undeniable, and should grace the libraries of most Moon Lee fans (if they can get their hands on it). Check it out if this sounds like your kind of thing.",1430784000,,4127,6.66542750929368
