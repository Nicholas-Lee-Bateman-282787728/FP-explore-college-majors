8671705,5,B00MD4SGRK,"This movie was great to see what the character had to endure to fulfill his life's ambition. I had seen part of this movie in the late 80's. I finally had the chance to see it all the way through. It met my expectations. The actors-Nat King Cole, Eartha Kitt,and Pearl Bailey and oh! Little Billy Preston really were amazing! I truly recommend this to anyone up for great drama and nostalgia. Thanks.",1414713600,3,400,4.493150684931507
