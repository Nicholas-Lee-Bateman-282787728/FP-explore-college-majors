8519592,1,B007N0R530,This DVD was not what I expected at all.  I was very disappointed.  It really wasn't about Michael Jackson at all.,1389571200,,114,4.380952380952381
8519593,1,B007N0R530,So terribly dissappointed! It's just some guys in a band talking. I couldn't even understand what they were saying or what it had to do with MJ. It's a rip off!,1347667200,4,160,4.193548387096774
8519594,2,B007N0R530,"This dvd pertains to how Michael Jackson influnenced a man who is trying to start and promote his own career. He has a good singing voice and his tribute song to Michael at the beginning was nice but as i continued to watch the dvd, i was beginning to wonder, okay this is another MJ video, but lets get to Michael. Whoever made this dvd was trying to get his own publicity and notoriety on the coat tails of Michael Jackson. Dont let the cover picture fool you. There are better dvds out there on Michaels life. Shop around a bit.",1343779200,9,531,4.267326732673268

8519596,3,B007N0R530,"This is a nice documentary, but it is not about Michael Jackson.

It is about a bunch of young musicians, who talk about how MJ influenced them and they present their own music.

You don't see or hear Michael Jackson in this film.",1342310400,15,230,4.325581395348837
