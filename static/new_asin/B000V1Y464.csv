Amy Lynn Best and Mike Watt play off of each other perfectly Amy is the leader of a female Brothel of Vampires and Mike is plays an Irish vampire hunter. First off don't let anyone ever say indie films are bad, i would put Feast of Flesh up to any of the genre films the studios are putting out today and i think it would beat everyone of them.

Look for some fine acting by Stacey Bartlebaugh-Gmys ,Aaron Bernard,Sofiya Smirnova,Bill Homan,Zoe Hunter and Jeff Waltrowski. Also you get a good amount of gore a first for Happy Cloud Productions. All in all i had fun with Feast Of Flesh and i highly reccomend it to anyone looking to check out a solid film

8216252,3,B000V1Y464,"Not the best vampire/brothel movie and, to tell the truth, not the worse one either.  This movie suffers from the same problems as most low-budget, a script that could have used a few more revisions, uneven dialogue, uneven acting, and poor editing.  There are a few bright spots in the movie, the story is at least somewhat original and some the actors can actually act.  If you can look past Mike Watt's confusion as to what accent Sheridan should have, you can see a fairly well structured if still two-dimensional character that is the only character in the film that seems to have some back story and gives you some reason to care for him. To mention the characters, none are really fleshed out, they seem to be one or two dimensional stereotypes that really do not give you any incentive to care about them.  One bright spot is the beautiful Sofiya Smirnova who plays the vampire Zhora.  Ms. Smirnova actually seems out of place in this movie and tends to draw attention every time she appears on screen, her modelling experience showing through in her sensual movements (watch her walk down the stairs and later writhe between two bloodied dead bodies) and poses and is a bit of a shock when she later turns into an animalistic, ruthless defender of the hive.
This movie is not perfect by a long shot, but if you want some mindless fun with some nudity, then you should give this film a try.

The DVD also contains a short ""Feast of Souls"" that is an interesting twist of lost souls and damnation.  The short is well worth the look into the DVD extras.",1420243200,,1559,4.546428571428572

8216255,2,B000V1Y464,"This is a really poor low budget effort. It is an attempt at a different type of vampire flick and it fails completely. Start off with a confused plot and characters, throw in some gore, poor staging, and dumb awkward fight scenes and you have a film that you can do without. Save your money.",1400371200,,292,4.327272727272727
8216256,4,B000V1Y464,"I liked this film a lot, but this isn't for mainstream horror fans.  You might need to be a fan of a lot of these independent video films that are made with mini DV camcorders to enjoy it. It does have a nice low-budget and independent film charm to it. It does have some flaws, and it could've been better.  I thought it gets a little too talky at times, and it would've been a better film if they just picked up the pace because the main reason why I want to see these independent digital video vampire flicks is just for stuff like gore and nudity; some of these talky parts may be somewhat boring to some people who want a faster pace throughout the entire film. I personally thought that this was the main problem with the picture. It starts off with a cool low-budget gore scene. I wouldn't label it as a slow-moving film. However, there are some parts here and there that should've been filled with just more nudity and gore rather than some talk that isn't really that necessary for this type of movie; for a film like this, it's best to just keep the pace going really fast and load it with exploitation. The film is about a brothel of vampires and a nearby gang that watches over them.  The vampires are vulnerable to this gangs beliefs; I thought this was original.  One of them even uses money as a weapon against the vampires while the other uses his religion.  This movie has good gore FX for its budget, and there's a good amount of it throughout the film. I thought that it should've been a little bit gorier, but there was still enough to please me; however, if you are looking specifically for something that delivers an over-the-top amount of gore, then I wouldn't recommend it.  I think some gore fans will probably want a little bit more gore in this one, but it does have some effective gore scenes.  There's also a decent amount of nudity, but it's not really explicit and there's no full frontal scenes; here's another problem because a low-budget independent vampire flick dealing with a brothel should just dish out the explicit sex and nudity. It's also decently directed, and the acting is better than many other independent digital video horror flicks that I've seen. However, it lacks atmosphere and good scenery; the obvious low-budget may be some of the reason for this. The settings for the entire film are mostly indoors.

The DVD quality overall is good. The picture is sharp and the brightness is fine. The color and contrast needs some improvement. There's also a good amount of extras like a commentary and a short film called THE FEAST OF SOULS. Unlike A FEAST OF FLESH which takes place almost entirely indoors, THE FEAST OF SOULS takes place outdoors. This short ghost film runs a little over a half hour, has no nudity, and has a limited amount of violence with some gore in parts; although there isn't any extreme type gore. The woodland locations provide some decent scenery, unlike THE FEAST OF FLESH which has you looking at the walls and stuff indoors. The making of segment and gag reel extras are pretty good, and you also get 3 trailers.",1347667200,5,3087,4.54954954954955
8216257,5,B000V1Y464,"SPOILER ALERT: This another fun filled film by the folks at Happy Cloud pictures. Their first foray into the vampire genre and without most of the tongue and cheek humor that is in their earlier pictures. The film is ferociously original in the story concept breathing some life into the very tired vampire cliches. First off you have two warring parties stuck in a very uneasy truce. On one side you have a brothel run by a vampire clan feeding off of the unlucky customers. On the other is an apparent off shoot of the Irish Republican Army who are defending the local townspeople. The truce is simple, don't touch the townies and there will be no war. The vampires accidently break the truce and now there will be Hell to pay. Some of the original twists are that it is your belief (or faith) and not holy symbols that ward off the vampires. The leader (played by Mike Watt) is a believer in Christianity so those symbols are weapons in his hands. Another believes in money so his weapon is flashing the green. All in all probably one of the best vampire pictures I have seen in years and well worth buying.",1243296000,5,1110,4.472906403940887
8216258,1,B000V1Y464,"What makes a B-movie hottie like Debbie Rochon lend her name--and a scant few minutes of screen time--to an amateurish, zero-budget, zero-talent attempt like this? Porcine scream-monger Amy Lynn Best serves up this vanity product with an extra helping of ineptitude, aided incapably by a few of her posse members.  The story concerns a bordello of female vampires targeted for intervention by a group of well-armed holy warriors trying to rescue one man's loved one.  This might have been cool in the hands of someone with more than a few bucks to spend.  Every minute of this ""film"" is wasted with cheap special effects (is that Cherry Kool-Aid they're using for blood?), bottom-of-the-barrel editing and high-school caliber acting.  No, sorry, that's an insult to high school students.  Don't be fooled.  The time and money you spend on this dreck will leave a sick feeling in your stomach.",1217030400,6,892,5.034013605442177
