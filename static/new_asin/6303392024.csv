635176,2,6303392024,"Let me start off by saying that I am in love with the first and second Tenchi Muyo! OVA series. Although sometimes the story was confusing due to writing or translations, it is one of the coolest and funniest animes that I've seen. The character development and inventiveness of the series was great. The latest seven episodes included in The Viridian Collection are unfortunately a big exception.

I was very excited as the episodes were being released sequentially, and I bought the individual volumes as they became available. However, after each episode I was left with a big sense of disappointment. Here is a list of my biggest complaints:

-Ryoko is now voiced by Mona Marshall who seems to have no respect for the incredible coolness that Petrea Burchard brought to the character. Once my favorite character of the series, I now dread any time she appears on screen. Marshall has done good work in the past, but her shrill and downright obnoxious performance as Ryoko will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  The actress playing Mihoshi (and the writers who produced her dialogue) is also missing what made the character so funny in the originals. In these episodes she's reduced to a completely unfunny moron.

-The series is totally and completely weighted down by new characters who serve absolutely no purpose to the overall story. Not only do they bring in new characters, but they fail to develop them at all. The writers seem to think that a one sentence explanation of where they came from will be enough to satisfy viewers. Sadly, the new characters (of which there are probably around 10) distract from the ones that fans of the series have grown love.

-The real meat of the story arc that people are familiar with from the second OVA is really only addressed in one episode, and, since there is enough content in that one episode to have filled the entire seven episodes of the series, the episode as a whole comes off as contrived and convoluted. Not only that, but you'll start the episode (Z) and be completely lost as it plays out thinking that surely you must have skipped an episode before. Had the writers not spent the first five episodes introducing new characters and telling completely superfluous stories, this episode could have been the climactic conclusion that would have satisfied fans of the series. Sadly it is only a suggestion of what it could have been.

I'm sure this comes across as overly negative, but the only positive aspects I can think of would be fairly good animation and the voice acting of the veteran cast members. Unfortunately even these have flaws with odd looking 3D computer generated animations at times and the age of the voice actors coming through in their performances.

I'm hesitant to recommend this even to diehard fans of the franchise. While the craving to get some sort of closure for the series is understandable, I'm afraid this will only leave fans feeling bitter. If you feel the need to see these latest episodes, do your best to find somewhere to rent them such as Netflix. It's most likely not something you'll want to watch a second time.",1311033600,5,3115,4.768089053803339

635181,5,6303392024,"As a huge Tenchi fan that grew up watching it when Cartoon Network actually showed cartoons and Toonami I really really enjoy Tenchi Muyo! It's ashamed to see that it is not as popular as it was before but things change but let me get back on the actual DVD,

It's has 4 Episodes from the 1st Tenchi Series which is the OVA and not any of the other ones that you may have seen or encountered (like Universe or Tokyo) it's starts off with Tenchi trying to get into this cave but his grandpa (who is actually the runaway prince of Jurai, Yosho) forbids him. In a comedic twist he ends up getting the keys to the cave and from there he meets a mummified Ryoko who his grandpa Yosho defeated long ago. Now Tenchi being scared leaves the cave but takes with him the sword named ""Tenchi"" as well. Later on he meets Ryoko rejunvinated and looking sexier than before wants revenge on Tenchi since she as she puts it ""wants revenge and doesn't care whether he is Yosho or not."" Tenchi in another comedic twist cuts off Ryoko's hand and ""defeats her"". Even though she lost, she has the ability of rengeneration so her hand is okay. In the end Tenchi returns home to find a nice surprise in store for him in his bed. ;)

The next episode basically introduces Ayeka, Sasami and Nobuyuki (Tenchi's Dad) but I won't go and summarize it since people probably want to see it for themselves. Anyway, this DVD only has four episodes but is much much cheaper than the actual OVA boxset, which is about 100 dollars here on Amazon, so if you want to own the OVAs I'd recommend buying these DVDs instead but overall, if you're a fan of the Toonami anime classics like Dragon Ball, One Piece and Outlaw Star then you'll love Tenchi Muyo!

5 Stars out of 5! (I'd give it 10 though. :D)",1291248000,3,1761,4.33030303030303
635182,4,6303392024,"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki has been charming fans since the first OVA was released in 1992. Often thought of as the grandfather of harem anime, the OVA follows the adventures of Tenchi Masaki, a seemingly ordinary Japanese high school student,  who makes the mistake of opening up the cave at the shrine his grandfather runs, leading to the arrival of a space pirate, alien princesses, a ditzy yet uncanny space cop, and a (usually) diminutive scientific genius. The title of this set is somewhat misleading, as it contains only OVA 3, episodes 14-20. (The 1st 13.5 episodes are not owned by FUNimation.) This set will entertain fans, though it has also been known to anger fans who did not approve of certain creative decisions taken by Mr. Kajishima. The main flaw with these 7 episodes is that it does too much in too little time, introducing major plot points and new characters

Tenchi Muyo is a series which can confuse many casual fans, because, since it first came out in 1992, there have been many different continuities and reboots of the franchise. This OVA set is part of what was once called, appropriately enough, the OVA continuity. However, the OVA continuity does not consist of only the OVAs anymore: it also contains the TV series, Tenchi Muyo! GXP. It is best to think of it as the Kajishima continuity, named  after the series creator/co-creator who has been the sole guide of the OVA continuity from episode 7 onward.

So, what does the OVA /Kajishima continuity consist of? And in what order should you watch it? The starting point is OVA 1, where Tenchi accidently releases space pirate Ryoko (ep. 1), whose release brings the arrival and stranding on Earth of Juraian princesses Aeka(Ayeka) and Sasami and the introduction of Ryo-Ohki, a cabbit (cat-rabbit mix) which is either extremely adorable, or can transform into one of the most dangerous spaceships in the universe. (ep. 2-3). Next to arrive is Galaxy Police officer Mihoshi (ep. 4) and scientific genius Washu (ep. 6).  OVA 1 followed the introduction of these various girls into Tenchi's life, the arrival of the villain, Kagato, and the discovery of Tenchi's hidden heritage and power. The first 6 episodes, released from 1992-1993, were a success and a 7th special episode was released in January, 1994, and a 2nd OVA series was released from Sept. 1994 - Sept. 1995.

Tenchi fans were delighted to learn that Mr. Kajishima announced that he was working on 3 new Tenchi series: Tenchi Muyo! GXP: Galaxy Police Transporter, OVA 3, and St. Knight's Tale(Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari - a 13 episode OVA set 15 years after the end of OVA 3, following the adventures of Tenchi's half-brother, Kenshi; it finished being released in Japan early in 2010). Fans were puzzled to learn that GXP would be the first of these series to be released, but would be set one year AFTER the events of OVA 3. The GXP TV series was released in 2002. The 3rd OVA was released in 6 episodes from Sept. 2003 - March 2005. Again, a 7th special episode was released in Sept. 2005.

Proper viewing order: OVA episodes 1-13.5, GXP, OVA 3 (OVA episodes 14-20)
.
An advantage Japanese fans have is that they have easy access to supplementary material, from radio and CD dramas to self-published manga and novels that often don't make their way to the Western world. Many of the characters introduced in GXP and OVA 3 had already been introduced to the Japanese audience. Even with this, too much takes place in OVA 3 to be easily digested.  The introduction of the new characters results in too little time being spent on the girls already introduced.

Tenchi is visiting his father and his assistant, Rea, who lives in town. Passing his old school (in Japan, the last part of high school is optional) and the lot where his house used to be, Tenchi thinks back to all the changes in his life. However, Tenchi is starting to wonder what happened to his mother. Ryo-Ohki, who is now able to also transform into a young cabbit girl, gets lost, and Ryoko gets a bit maternal taking care of her. But the first new arrival comes, Tennyo, Tenchi's previously unknown older sister. She's shortly followed by the separate arrivals of Airi, Tenchi's grandmother,  (Yosho's wife) who announces that Tenchi's been betrothed to Noike, the adopted daughter of Lady Seto (the mother of Queen Misaki, and the grandmother of Aeka and Sasami). While we get introduced to the no-nonsense Noike, who quickly settles into the household (and who was once Mihoshi's former GXP partner), we have the arrival of Lady Seto, and the behind the scenes machinations of tansdimensional being Lady Tokimi, whose minion, Z, is on a mission of his own. This leads to the arrival of Mihoshi's brother, who mistakenly believes Mihoshi's in need of rescuing from a two(six)-timing Tenchi. Oh, and Tenchi does find out about his mother. Whew.

All this, and more, takes place in episodes 1-6, (episode 7 is a wrap-up special with a wedding - NOT Tenchi's) and there's just too much going on in too little time. GXP is truly needed to be watched to have any appreciation of either Seto or Airi. (GXP follows the adventures of Seina Yamada, a friend and neighbor of Tenchi whose bad luck leads him into being mistakenly recruited by the Galaxy Police).

Still, this will appeal to many fans. Those coming into this series without years of preconceptions and who watch it in proper order will also appreciate it, as. whatever you may think of his storyline decisions, Kajishima has created a rich and deep universe for Tenchi and friends.",1287619200,2,5550,4.793933054393306

635229,3,6303392024,"Like many people my age I was treated to the strange, cliffhanger ending of the original Tenchi series when it aired on Cartoon Network in 2000. The series was fabulous: fun characters, creative and pseudo-mystical sci-fi trappings, and lots of humor. But how did it end?

Years later this came out. It is 7 episodes to wrap the thing up, and on a whole they leave much to be desired. The charm of the original series is lost with boring stories that lack the atmosphere and charm of the originals... that's true at least of the first five episodes, but then we get the final two: a suprising return to form that fills us in on exactly what the point of the series was and wraps things up in satisfactory fashion.

I get the feeling that these final two episodes are comprised of ideas that were founded back in the mid-'90s when the original series was beging thought up, and the first five episodes were just filler, like how most of George Lucas' backstory for Star Wars was used in Episode III leaving him to come up with a lot of foam peanuts to fill those first two movies.

It's worth watching only because the first 13 epsidoes from the 1990s are, and you need this to wrap those up.",1280534400,2,1191,4.404545454545454
635230,5,6303392024,"It wasn't till after I ordered and watched ""Tenchi Muyo!

For me I debated long and hard over whether or not to spend a little more for the ""Techni Muyo -- OVA Box Set,"" however, in the end I did because it adds coninuity to the ""Tenchi Muyo!

635231,3,6303392024,"Finally - the long awaited completion to the Ryo Ohki OVA collection is available! GREAT! Now I get to watch it from beginning to end as it was intended.

...or so I thought...

First off, the different voices for Lady Tokimi, Tenchi, Ryoko, Nobuyuki, and Mihoshi really throws off the enjoyment of the story after watching it back to back with the original 13 OVA episodes. If I had spaced it out, it might not be as jarring. But, there it is. And to be honest, only Ryoko's and Tokimi's voice actress' had changed. The others are just out of practice I guess... And after a while, they seem to find their spot again.

I just can't get over Mihoshi now sounding like Sugar (from Snow Fairy Sugar) instead of Mihoshi. She falls back into Mihoshi better as the series progresses, but tends to go back and forth. The voices of the guardians, Washu, Sasami, and Ayeka, were of course, spot on.

The first 30 minutes is mostly recaps from the first 13 episodes. Almost no new material here worth speaking of, other than the introduction of a couple of new characters.

Also starting about 30 minutes in the DD 5.1 audio track contains dirty audio causing the LFE to oscillate. This is mostly noticeable in the quieter dialogue scenes. Speaking of audio - at least on the 5.1 track, I can't say on the others, some of the voices echo for no reason as if the recording studio wasn't properly deadened, or the mix wasn't done properly. This happens more on the surround channels than the front field channels.

Disk 2 doesn't seem to have these audio problems. In fact, regarding disk 2, the only complaints I have are that the story line reminded me a lot of Evangellion Death and Rebirth. Without giving away any spoilers, I won't say more. :)

Disk 3...  Well, it is just one episode. Tenchi finally finds out about his mother... Or does he? I'll let you decide. This disk is also free from the ""dirty audio"" that plagued the 5.1 track of the first disk.

All-in-all, it did clean up most of the hanging story line, even if there were inconsistancy issues along the way. But, I guess after so much time, that's bound to happen.

If you are just a casual watcher of the series, then you might want to find a way to rent it. If you are an avid fan, then this is a must for your collection.",1280102400,,2283,4.427207637231503
635232,2,6303392024,"Like many of the other reviewers of this long-awaited series, the original Tenchi Muyo! Ryo Ohki OVA's were among my very first anime titles which served to introduce me to the medium, along with Sailor Moon and Slayers.  And I, too, looked forward to the continuation and possible conclusion of this very popular franchise.  Alas, its very popularity has sown the seeds of its undoing!  A brief look at what has gone before:

In the 1990's our world was introduced to the zany world of Tenchi, space pirate Ryoko, lordly Jurai Princesses Ayeka and Sasami, Galaxy Police Mihoshi, Genius Scientist Washu, and her nemesis Kagato.  For six delightful episodes their story unfolded, ending somewhat satisfyingly with Kagato's defeat.  Predictably, this success led to a couple of stand-alone episodes involving rivalry of the remaining girls over Our Hero Tenchi, and a second OVA sreries which further expanded Tenchi's Jurai relations and introduced some rather ominous new apparant villians.  Though slightly inferior in style and artwork, these generally remained faithful to the original story and characterizations.

Due to the success of the OVA's, Tenchi moved to television in two unrelated ""reimaginings"" of the storyline with the one-season Tenchi Universe and later Tenchi in Tokyo.  These successes were joined by THREE stand-alone theatrical movies which mainly followed the Tenchi Universe version of the story.  The greatest single misfortune, however, in trying to make sense of this all came with the creation of yet another series for television, only loosely based on the Tenchi story: Tenchi Muyo! GXP, which only ""borrows"" the popular Tenchi name for commercial purposes.  It centers on an unlikely NEW Tenchi relative for the main character and was merely an excuse for a sort of You're Under Arrest story set in space, this time featuring the Galaxy Police!  Also unfortunately, it DOES feature the original Tenchi cast, but merely as background characters to vaguely connect the Jurai royalty and the GXP.

Fast forward to 2005 when the current OAV series we are considering here finally appeared after a hiatus of a dozen years or more since the original.  With now no less than FOUR different and mostly unrelated versions of the World According to Tenchi to pick from ( not counting at all the Pretty Sammy/Magical Project S spinoffs which inhabit their own separate continuity/universe ), the authors of this tripe chose the first and the last to vainly attempt to somehow shoehorn together into a coherent single tale.  There were by now so many diverse plotlines and loose threads of stories to try to tie together, it's little wonder that this became such an Excercise in Futility which wound up alienating most of its long-time fans.  Complaints you will read in these reviews about the pointless and boring ""new"" characters introduced here almost all overlook the fact that this is far less a SEQUEL to Tenchi Muyo! than it is a PREQUEL to GXP!

This of course is NOT the ""complete"" Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki OVA series, but the final ""third"", made up of only those seven episodes which attempt to bridge the yawning chasm between the original thirteen episodes and the GXP TV series.  The first episode seems especially jarring in that it features a long series of flashbacks using the beautiful but now old-style animation in stark contrast with the latest CGA.  ( In an especially pointless use of modern technology a sequence featuring a small truck is CG. )  Equally jarring is the presence of a jazzy score totally unlike anything heard previously in any version of Tenchi.  Characterization also rightly comes in for serious criticism due to the psychological contortions to which some of the former main cast members are put.

Completionists will of course want to add this set to their other Tenchi titles, but be warned it fails to address most of the concerns of long-time Tenchi fanatics.  Perhaps those who REALLY liked GXP will find this set worthwhile; but anyone who feels an investment in or attachment to any of the loved and well-established Tenchi characters can only feel revulsion at what its creators hath wrought with this very disappointing attempt.",1273449600,5,4200,5.0726744186046515
635233,5,6303392024,"This DVD contains the first 4 episodes of the tenchi muyo OVA that started it all.

the episodes are
1 Ryoko Resurrected
2 here comes Ayeka
3 hello Ryo-ohki
4 Mihoshi falls to the land of stars

The qualaty of this DVD is excelent it has both japanese and english tracks with english subtitels. In case you are wondering yes it's the real deal not bootleg crap.

Many people are confused about the order in wich the tenchi series was made this OVA in three volumes is what started it all, it is fallowed by tenchi universe the TV series, then tenchi in tokyo the TV series. There are 3 movies and a spin of series called tench muyo galaxy police there is also anouther ova.

I hope you find my review helpfull I <3 Tenchi!! 5 stars!!",1264982400,3,733,4.2898550724637685
635234,4,6303392024,This Tenchi is a little different from the others I've watched. Some of the voices are different. Some of the graphics are too. It's not bad but its not great either.,1252972800,,166,4.387096774193548
635235,4,6303392024,"This particular volume in the Tenchi Muyo OAVs brings us the conflict with Kagato, the introduction of another girl into Tenchi's extended family and a comedy episode with some foreshadowing for things to come. It still features the usual mix of comedy and plot twists galore that the Tenchi Muyo OAVs are well known for. The disc comes with Japanese and English audio which will satisfy fans of both preferences. But special features in this disc are lacking as the only notable feature is a collection of trailers for titles that Pioneer/Geneon recently distributed and licensed back in 2002/ 2003 when this DVD first came out. If you just want the episodes, then this volume of the Tenchi Muyo OAVs is worth purchasing. If you want special features, then try hunting down the Tenchi Muyo Ultimate Edition DVD set which has an extensive offering of special features for fans to go giddy over.",1252886400,,894,4.849673202614379
635236,5,6303392024,I have said this before as I am sure many others have but tenchi muyo really is the god father of combining traditional anime with comedy and japanese customs. I do not like a lot of anime out there but there are these few that trully know how convey a story and keep the watcher interested and like many others I too awaited eagerly for the conclusion to this series. This disc really does contain everything that makes this series perfect including tenchi's ancestry.,1250899200,2,469,4.595238095238095
635237,5,6303392024,"Those just getting into anime should first be told to try tenchi muyo, this anime introduced the harem comedy to the US and has brought many followers in its wake. It was sad to see it finally completed few years ago considering I had been a fan since I was in my 11 years old. I can say this, while the anime is not 100% for children there are many episodes that can be classified as such and I hope future generation get their anime start with tenchi like I did",1249084800,7,463,4.0989010989010985
635238,2,6303392024,"Tenchi Muyo! is one of those legendary anime productions that continues to live on in the minds of fans. Essentially a fairy tale and a coming-of-age story, the plot revolves around the seemingly simple Tenchi who inexplicably finds himself surrounded by a bevy of beautiful alien women. Naturally, zany adventure and epic danger quickly ensue. For many, this now common ""harem"" style of anime was their first introduction to the art form during a time when it was still a rare commodity. And for most, the series' cast of lovable, fascinating, and unforgettable characters still remain indelibly etched onto their hearts.

The franchise is also a complicated one, with various alternate versions of the original series spanning nearly all forms of media, including television, manga, video games, and even novels. Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki - Box Set The Complete Series is the much anticipated seven episode continuation of the original OVA (original video animation, or direct-to-video) animated series, although fans expecting to find the show's earlier thirteen episodes will not find them here.

Misleading monikers aside, these newest installments to the Tenchi canon serve as perfect examples of how not to resurrect a series. After a thirteenth episode that ended on a rather inconclusive note, fans, after years of waiting, naturally imagined the new installments would contain the same heartfelt romantic intrigue, epic battles, and zany shenanigans associated with the earlier productions. Instead, they received seven boring, nearly humorless episodes that revolved around characters not even present in the earlier stories. Below are some of my more detailed complaints, but beware of spoilers:

Remember Ryoko, the awesome space pirate? She's now a weak, ineffectual whiner. Remember Noike and Misau? Of course not, because they weren't in the earlier episodes, but they dominate these. Remember the awesome battles in the climactic sixth episode? Not one is worth mentioning this time around. Remember wondering what Tenchi's mother must have been like? Well, you got your wish--she was a half-deluded prankster who enjoyed toying with Tenchi through trickery and gags. Remember thinking Yosho was an unmarried widower? Well, turns out he's actually married to a Jurain woman that he sees, hmmm, virtually never. Remember thinking Lady Seto, the Devil Princess of Jurai, must really be a force to be reckoned with? Nah, she's just a harmless, somewhat frail woman. Remember looking forward to a climactic showdown with the Goddess Tokimi? Never happens, turns out she just wants to be friends! Remember wondering about the identity of the Counter-Actor? Of course not, she never existed or was even hinted at in the earlier stories, nor is she well explained in these. And, of course, here's the biggest one--Which girl does Tenchi choose? Apparently, he will someday marry all of them! *sigh*

Couple all these complaints with just average animation and shaky writing, and you have what is possibly the worst continuation of a beloved series anyone could have ever conjured up. The show's only slightly redeeming quality is that certain long-held questions regarding some of the characters are finally resolved or explained (but whether anyone likes those ""answers"" is a different story).

The entire Tenchi Muyo franchise is special. Seek out the earlier episodes (known as Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki OVA 1 and 2), check out the TV series Tenchi Universe (and its excellent sequel movies, Tenchi Muyo in Love and Tenchi Forever), and seek out Hitoshi Okuda's brilliant No Need for Tenchi manga novels. But as for the episodes in this set, they will only make you cry.",1246233600,102,3675,5.296740994854202
635266,4,6303392024,"I liked the series just fine but this still seemed like it was missing some pieces.  One time they show a flashback to where Ryo Ohki took on the entire Jurai fleet, but I don't recall that scene from anywhere.  Maybe it's me LOL.  Still a great short Tenchi series.",1245110400,,266,4.28
635267,5,6303392024,"This is boy meets girl series, with quite a few girls.  Lots of humor and the animation is very good.  This is a harem anime with some nudity in it.  This anime is much better than the Cart**n NW version that aired on cable.  They heavily edited quite a few things about this series.  This is an anime for teenagers and older to enjoy.  There is nothing that can not be seen by any age, however some of the humor is romance related.  Over all the Tenchi Muyo OVA series is head and shoulders above Tenchi Universe and Tenchi in Tokyo anime series.
If you like Photon, Dual, el Hazard, Love Hina types of animes, you will like the Tenchi Muyo OVA series.",1198195200,2,653,4.260162601626016

635269,5,6303392024,"Needless to say that I became a huge fan of all of the Tenchi series after watching them on Cartoon Network a few years ago. Sadly, I haven't seen it ever since, until now! I bought this DVD and it really brought back the memories. Man, I do love this series. It has action and comedy. I plan to buy many many more!

My favorite episode on this DVD has to be the third, because it is the funniest. It's your typical Tenchi episode, the girls fighting over who will win Tenchi, but it's always hysterical. Especially when the girls take advice from a romance comic book! A lot of action on the two episodes prior to this, overall a great DVD to have for all fans!",1124064000,4,662,4.21259842519685
635270,5,6303392024,"Amazing.  This is just one of THOSE series.  This is something that just took everything to a brand new level.  ""Tenchi Muyo"" was a real trend setter for Japanese anime and marked Pioneer as one of the true, ahem, ""Pioneers"" in anime.  The animation is FLAWLESS, as is the superb DVD production by Pioneer.
What you have here is a hybrid anime that used many of the qualities of other good animes and improved upon all of them while, at the same time, adding its own unique touch.  Tenchi Muyo is a sci-fi show, a love comedy, and an anime drama all at the same time.  Everything flows together and the planning and execution of this series is breathtaking to behold.  The music, animation, directing, and story coalesce into something that is just really special.  When animes like this started showing up in America around 1995, it was a golden moment for young people.
One warning, though.  I need to warn parents about this anime.  There is nudity in the last episode, so you might want to keep this away from your child until they turn 18.  It's not GROSS nudity, however, it's there, for sure.
Thanks, Pioneer.",1075766400,5,1116,4.585858585858586
635271,5,6303392024,"The fun continues with the ongoing adventures of Tenchi and co.! First, Ryoko tells Mihoshi the Galaxy Police want her to return to head quarters. (Not too hard convincing that ditz of anything-how'd she ever become a first-class detective, anyway?) Will Mihoshi be saying goodbye for good?
Next is the ""Mihoshi Special"" episode. It's not concidered an official part of the OAV series, but it should be. Mihoshi spends a hot summer afternoon telling her friends the story of how she and her partner Kiyone solved the crime of the stolen ultra-energy matter. (When Ryoko asks what that is, Mihoshi answers,""It's a matter that produces ultra-energy, of course!"") Mihoshi, it seems, is unable to remember the exact details, so she casts her friends in her story in different roles-entierly against their will, of course. You can probably guess what most of them end up as. The best moment is when Sasami, in Mihoshi's story, turns into Magical Girl Pretty Sammy, and then she, along with her talking animal sidekick Ryo-ohki, go off to save the others. My only problem is the last scene in the show, apparently set in the real world of the Tenchi series, which shows Kiyone cursing Mihoshi. Kiyone is one of my favorite characters in the series, but still, it's hard for me to belive that she could still be alive after...well, you'll see. Still, this is a must-see for Tenchi fans.
Those interested may like to know that Magical Girl Pretty Sammy and the talking Ryo-ohki made another appearence in an episode of Tenchi Universe before getting their own series, and Kiyone became a regular on Tenchi Universe.",1060732800,3,1607,4.8901098901098905

Ayeka was again supposed to marry Tenchi and that's the last thing most of us would want to see. I wasn't too happy about seeing Washu as a bad guy. The episode was not bad...don't get me wrong, I just expected a new plot. I reccomend this video for TENCHI fans and non-TENCHI fans. It is good.

Of course, her nemesis Pixy Misa gets involved with Bill Gates , I mean Biff Standard (same thing) so poor Bill (umm Biff) has a fighting chance.
In all the commotion, there are some tender moments revealing what's going on inside of Sasami's head.  That's what makes this series special.  She's the perfect daughter we would all like to have.
The Sammy series is extra complicated because 4 different instances of it exist. Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the ""Mihoshi Special"" and later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. (It was Sasami's dream to be Pretty Sammy). Next came the OVA, which is what this tape is from. Later a TV series followed.
Recommmended for Shoujo (Japanese Girl Anime) and Tenchi fans. This one is extra funny for those who work in the computer industry.  This is also good for little kids, and those who are kids at heart.",989280000,2,1183,4.673076923076923

In Vol. 1 she tells this great story about why such a little kid is out  alone and when Mihoshi re-tells it it's simply hilarious.  Anyways, in this  volume the plot becomes even more ridiculus.  Pixy Misa comes back and  Tenchi is a dumb as ever, Sammy seems a bit better adjusted to using magic  now.

While the dub version is well  done, they heavily censor this scene and the translations turn out *very*  different, making the sub version a must have for any serious Tenchi fan,  although it's not exactly appropriate for younger viewers.
