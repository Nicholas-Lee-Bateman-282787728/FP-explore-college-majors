Ok, I have finally watched the entire series all in one go.
Overall I think it is very funny and very good! By the end I wanted to see and know more. The things that make a good series in my eyes are, you care about the characters and you want to know more about them. All I know is, I want to know more. I found that by episode 4 I was emotionally invested in the characters and I had to hide my tears from others in the room (I am such a cry-baby). The storyline for that ep was very poignant and I knew that because I welled up, I actually cared about the characters involved. I think it surprised me, because up until that point I hadn't really thought of Starhyke as a real show. Seeing it finished has convinced me that the Industry has been very blind to what could be a cult classic in the Sci-Fi scene. Again, this is my own personal opinion.

Hopefully, most of you who read this review will know the basic premise of the show so I don't have to explain it all.

First, I want to tell you about the things I wasn't that keen on. I am not a big fan of martial arts and I found it a little distracting from the general theme of the show and oddly out of place. I think a general punch up would have been more appropriate, although Bull Ox bopping the bad guys on the head and knocking them out was inspired. Also, Cropper kicking the Reptid while he was already down was hysterical.

Reg and Vilma's role on the ship I felt wasn't properly explained, we know that they are the maintenance crew, but there was no explanation for the fact that they are subnormal to the rest of the crew.

I also felt that the dance sequence when they are hallucinating was a little too long and I started to get bored.

So, those are my few criticisms! As for what I liked about the show, well, how long have I got, J. I want to tell you about the diamonds in the ruff, as I like to call them. First is Ensign Christian, played by Jason Bailey. Watching him pine for Sally whom he is clearly in love with while she only has eyes for Cropper is heart wrenching. I really felt sorry for him. I was really rooting for him to `get the girl'.
Second is Tom, played by Kevin Barry. Tom is Blowhards son in Episode 4. He is defiantly one to watch for in the future.
Third is Rogan, played by Eugene Washington. Rogan is a scoundrel and Eugene played him perfectly.
These are the minor characters that I particularly remembered and who stood out in my mind.

My personal favourite characters in the show so far are
Sally (Stephanie Jory) Cropper (Brad Gorton) Dotty (Suanne Braun) and the Hologram (Gene Foad). I could go on for pages telling you all about these characters, but then you wouldn't need to watch the show. Suffice it to say that all of the characters are spot-on and integral to show overall. Blowhard (Claudia Christian) also plays her role very well and I personally feel she comes into her own in Episode 4. Again, I could go on for hours and hours.

Ok, so my basic overview is this. Watching this group of people stranded in the past suffering from an Alien virus that has re-awakened their emotions and seeing their reactions to the situations they find themselves in is very funny. You have to remember that they have never felt emotion before, so every emotion is intensified. So if they are sad, they are 10 times sadder than the average human and so on. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series. It was very well cast and I loved all of the characters. The references to well known classics are very well done and very funny. In Particular Striker as Gandalf was hilarious.

I think my favourite episode is 4, Reboot. It has such a brilliant balance of humour and sadness. Also, the music in that episode is amazing.

I know that the series is a long time coming but I truly believe that it is worth the wait.",1345248000,,3866,4.26912568306011
