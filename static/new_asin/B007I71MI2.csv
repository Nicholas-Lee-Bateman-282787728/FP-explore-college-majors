8517368,5,B007I71MI2,"This is a very sweet and quirky low-budget movie written & directed by (and starring) Amber Benson, fom Buffy the Vampire Slayer. A couple other Buffy alums show up in this movie as well. Although this is billed as a quirky story about a young woman trying to find Mr. Right, that makes it sound a lot more stupid and boring than it actually is. The characters in this movie are very cool and interesting. James Marsters is adorable. I'd say this is defnitely a chick fluck (a guy I watched it with found it boring) but it goes beyond the genre. I'd like to watch this again.",1409875200,,575,4.333333333333333
8517369,5,B007I71MI2,It is awesome! But my disc was formatted in PCA format so it wouldn't play in my DVD player. But windows media player on my PC played it fine!,1403136000,,142,3.9310344827586206
8517370,1,B007I71MI2,Didn't get it. Was bored beyond watching within minutes. Maybe not for over 30s? Certainly not for me or my wife!,1389657600,,113,4.428571428571429
8517371,5,B007I71MI2,"I really enjoyed this movie!  It was a great little art-house/indie film made by talented people just for the love of film-making.  I laughed out loud a couple of times; there are some very funny moments in this movie.
And, OMG! who could not love seeing the great James Marsters in a dress!  Lovely to see him playing such an adorable dork, after his run as the sexy vampire, Spike.",1351987200,,383,4.442857142857143
8517372,5,B007I71MI2,"I love Amber Benson and James Marsters from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Andy Hallet (may he rest in peace) from Angel series. I only recently heard of this movie which was written, directed, and produced by Amber, so I just had to check it out and I really liked it! It was different, and I really enjoyed it. Would recommend to anyone, especially fans of BtVS and Angel. It was a fun watch!!!!!",1349654400,,396,4.364864864864865
8517373,5,B007I71MI2,"So I just got this movie from ebay actually from Amber's mom. And I haven't even finished it and it already has had me cracked up throughout.  If you need a laugh, it's the perfect movie to watch. Amber is quirky as ever and the straight to camera monologue is something that you don't get in movies often enough.  It was written with some great comedy in mind and it definately is a great movie.  If you like Amber Benson, I thin you'll love this film Chance. As I said it's a laugh in the darkness, I've been crappy and then I watched this movie and laughing is all I good do.

Definately check this out! You'll love Amber Benson and James Marsters and quirkiness of the film.  Even being cheaply made, I think it's better than million dollar movies.  Why? No CGI and all that specil effect crap that makes it look all fake.  It's a real movie and it's got a good storyline behind it.  Definately something to keep you laughing until the very end.",1344988800,,949,4.322033898305085
8517374,5,B007I71MI2,"As a fan of Angel the Series, I'll admit I was mostly interested in this film to see Andy Hallett. It was bittersweet to see members of the Buffy and Angel cast together again, in roles so different than their roles on those shows. It's a sweet, quirky little film about letting down walls and taking chances, and gives you a few things to think about regarding gender roles in relationships. I laughed out loud a couple of times, and ached a little at seeing Andy Hallett in a rare part without his Lorne makeup.",1297036800,5,513,4.410526315789474
8517375,5,B007I71MI2,"For a low budget, very independant film, i was very entertained.  Watching Amber Benson in this (btw she's an awesome writer)is like watching Betty White in Lake Placid dropping F-bombs everywhere. You don't expect it, especially if you've only seen her play Tare in BTVS (awesome show!)so it's crack up to see her play this type of character. i ended up buying this movie, and am so glad i did, it's become one of my favorite movies to watch.  If you watch this, you will probably end up like me, giggling through the whole movie, not a bad way to spend an hour and a half. I think my favorite scene is when Rory pulls Chance into his car to talk to her, the poor guy doesn't get a chance (pun not intended....maybe) to reply to any of the rantings she gives him.  Everything he says to her gets turned around and she ends up making him cry.....nice! BTW seeing James Marsters in a dress is a nice added bonus! Oh, just found out too that Joss Whedon (hope my source is correct on this) wrote the opening song ""Burn me Down"" which is really catchy, i find myseld singing it in my head all the time now. Watch it, it's worth it!",1290643200,2,1128,4.286384976525822
8517376,4,B007I71MI2,"Chance is a quirky, feel-good romantic comedy that plays with the ways people open up to each other. Whether its slacker trust-fund baby Chance, her nerdy neighbor, new-age mother, or her best friend Simon (who has been crashing on her sofa for a year) the characters reveal their deepest feelings in totally unexpected ways.

Chance is a low-budget effort, and it shows--the camera work, lighting, and sound are pretty uninspired. There is also little in the way of non-diegetic music, although Grant Langston was effective in the role of a troubador/Greek chorus/busker.

If you're a Buffy/Angel fan, you'll get a kick out of seeing Amber Benson, James Marsters, and Andy Hallett playing roles so different from the ones they played on televison. And if you're a pathetic geeked-out Buffy fanatic (and I am) you'll enjoy seeing 1) The Bronze appearing as one of the sets; 2. Amber Benson and James Marsters wearing Oz's Dragon Inn t-shirt; 3. Spike with an American accent; 4. Tara kissing a boy; 5. Lorne sans horns and green makeup.",1274572800,8,1036,4.948275862068965
