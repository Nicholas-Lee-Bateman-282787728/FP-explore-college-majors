7888440,1,6305350752,"I usually have good instincts when it comes to blind purchases. Fruits Basket? Loved it despite how overly dramatic it gets at times. Seraphim Call? Some episodes are boring but the dvd was dirt cheap and it included the entire series. Outlaw Star? Actually, that one doesn't count because I had already seen the censored Toonami version when I briefly lived in Kansas City quite a long time ago.

I was really hoping I'd like this anime. The cover art is quite good and it didn't seem to have that MOE crap that I hate from modern anime. However while it's a very well animated cel anime, there is pretty much no plot at all and the sqeualing, oh good lord, your ears are going to pop just hearing the blonde girl's nonstop squealing. I recall part of the plot is that Yuna has to rescue a Princess or something, but in reality this short OVA has no plot at all. You just see a lot of semi naked hot chicks just screaming with obnoxious voices and running around in circles all day.

The anime was so abhorrent that I simply removed the tape from the vhs player without even bothering to see the end of the second episode. I still have the vhs if anyone is interested in keeping it. If you don't mind one of my cats seems to have nibbled on the paper of the cover and well deservedly scratched it, the actual tape is still perfectly new. Help me get rid of this abomination.",1485216000,,1375,4.325581395348837
7888441,1,6305350752,"This is the biggest Sailor Moon/Tenchi Muyo/Pretty Sammy/Wedding Peach/Sailor V, etc, rip-off I've ever seen.
I'll give any non-hentai anime a chance, so I watched the whole thing, hopping it would improve, meanwhile writing down a 2 paged list of obvious rip-offs, for example a blonde heroine who looks like Minako who wants to befriend the enemy, a masked hero who throws roses, a girl who looks like Sasami, a woman who looks like Urd wearing Tsunami's cloak, a food obsessed girl with a cat, & a sceen disturbingly familiar to when Prince Dimando dies.
Even if I had never seen the other series I mentioned, this is still a annoying series. It's the first thing I ever watched that truely made me want to loose my lunch.",1011744000,3,725,4.671875
7888442,5,6305350752,I think this film is a more of Satire. All I can say is it's better than Kimera. At least there's action and comedy. I won't spoil the plot but your blockbuster night wouldn't be a wasted one.,1001030400,2,192,4.078947368421052
7888443,4,6305350752,"A ""Variable action figure"" (actual text from the package) of Yuna was what originally got my attention and caused me to decide to begin watching the tapes.
Galaxy Faulein Yuna is the Savior of the Light and has been framed for treason. Fraulein D wants to make some trouble for Yuna. Yuna is joined by her friend, Yuri, who is an android who needs to eat constantly. Misaki is the new girl at school who keeps watching Yuna. Yuna begins to have lesbian thoughts about Misaki. Nothing actually happens. Yuna's thoughts just get carried away a couple of times.
There are silly moments throughout, and it may get melodramatic at times. Yuna tends to squeal alot whenever she gets excited such as when she finds a trail of rare Polylina trading cards. She just happens to be a major Polylina fan. Yuna also doesn't realize Polylina is really a member of her team. There are times when Yuna comes across as too innocent or too nice, but it adds to the camp quality of the show. Don't watch this expecting a serious show. Just enjoy the fun.
I admit I'm hooked on the opening theme ""Funny, Funny Little Girl,"" and the closing theme ""Good Night, Moon Shadow"" is nice too.",998870400,2,1164,4.5476190476190474
