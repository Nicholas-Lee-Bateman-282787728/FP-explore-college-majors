8016166,5,B0001RVMCM,"I am going to be visiting northern Spain soon and heard about Brian Sewell's program. I am finding this to be quite entertaining. I love English humor and Sewell excels at entertaining the viewer as well as educating. Brilliant, opinionated, colorful presentation!

Note about the PAL version. I am watching this on my Macbook Pro, using the Apple DVD player. The disc did not prompt me to change my region code to 2. I examined the disc information and found this (see attached image). So, this disc is set to play in all eight regions. Yes, it is a PAL disc but will play in all regions. I can't verify that it will play in a standard DVD player attached to a television, but I do not see why it would not. It plays in my region 1 player on my Macbook without changing",1503532800,,770,4.347222222222222

8016168,5,B0001RVMCM,"The late Brian Sewell's voice and accent are unforgettable.  This 6 episode program is moving and eye opening as Brian makes a spiritual journey in the footsteps of other pilgrims.  He describes himself as a lapsed Catholic but his journey brings an unexpected emotional epiphany.  This is not quite as much fun as Brian's masterpiece travelogue called The Grand Tour but if you like Brian you will love this.  He may have been the most opinionated man alive but the mix of art, buildings, and emotion in this program provides a unique perspective on the spiritual journey.",1457395200,,573,4.876288659793815
8016169,1,B0001RVMCM,"Sewell was magnificent in the Tour of Italy.  I was looking forward to enjoying this DVD as well, savoring every moment. However when placed in our player the screen read ""Playback Prohibited"". So, the one star is for Buyer Beware. It was supposed to be for the USA. I bought it used from Goodwill.",1416096000,4,298,4.518518518518518

8016171,5,B0001RVMCM,"I just finished this series along with the Grand Tour DVD's.  Just a word of caution, these particular DVD's are PAL and NOT NTSC format, so you will only be able to stream from a PC and not from a conventional DVD player in the states.  Regardless, I bought them, then wound up connecting my HDMI cable to my large screeen to watch direct from my Laptop.

Ok, I respect Brian and his views.  He is sometimes brutally honest with how he feels about art and architecture. Although he completed most of the journey in his older, well loved Mercedes, It was a magical experience to watch it.  The constant theme which made it's way back was his curiosity as to the ""Why"" pilgrims make this journey.  We get a nice amount of backround on Saint James and Brian's own interactions with the pilgrims themselves.  I thought the series was much, much too short.  I wanted it to continue far longer than it had.  His respect for those with faith could not be ignored and at times his agnostic views clashed with those of whom have deep faith, of which unexplainable.  I loved the ending and do not wish to give a spoiler.

Well Done.  Would like to see many more productions by Brian.....
