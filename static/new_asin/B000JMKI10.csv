2677812,5,B000JMKI10,"This is so far the best,the finest and the most moving film on the life of Christ. Its inspiring in faith.
I have watched this on TV since I was a little boy and still can't get over it even now that I jave it in BLU-RAY!

2677818,5,B000JMKI10,Best account of the life of Jesus. True you have to select one menu item to view it in English but I don't think that's to big of a deal. Highly recommended,1458864000,2,156,3.90625
2677819,5,B000JMKI10,"This movie was not ""up-converted"".  This series was originally shot on 35 mm film.  The restoration comes from that so the HD is HD. Just wanted to clarify that.  Even though the aspect ratio is 4:3,  it is still Hi Definition.",1457395200,2,227,4.463414634146342
2677820,2,B000JMKI10,"Theologicaly inaccurate in many areas...Excellent acting.
Google Jesus of Nazareth inaccuracies and you will see what I mean.... Biblical stories combined into one, out of proper timeline, omitted several very important happenings, made up happenings...etc.etc. not recommending this movie because of that...too bad because the acting is excellent.  I really loved the parable of the prodigal son scene.",1457136000,,403,5.948275862068965

2677829,5,B000JMKI10,"I went to a Catholic Grade school during the 80s and we watched this movie in class.  I really loved the movie growing up but as many reviewers have commented, the DVD/video cuts scenes. I agree this is the way to get the entire movie and it is gorgeous in Blu Ray.  Since there are no extras on the disc, only the movie, there is nothing that would be missed out on.  Now that it is Lent, it is a great time to watch and enjoy this remarkable movie!",1455926400,3,450,4.033707865168539
2677830,5,B000JMKI10,"Best religious movie ever made.  Franco Zefferelli's masterpiece shows visually the life of Jesus in dramatic  and touching events and tops previous films such as King Of Kings. 10 Commandments, & Greatest Story Ever Told.",1454198400,,222,5.314285714285714

2677858,5,B000JMKI10,"I'll make this short (sort of) and sweet .  This is my favorite filmed production of the birth, life, ministry, miracles, death and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour.  Had it on DVD (my first DVD ever as a matter of fact).  Donated my DVD or accidentally sold it in a lot with other DVDs, so I figured I would just wait for the Blu Ray to be released here in the U.S.  Took too long, so I looked at imports.  German-- Region B only, colors washed out and missing two key scenes.  Mexican-- Region B again, color more saturated (maybe too saturated) and STILL missing same two scenes.  Finally saw this one, color much better, plays in all regions (A/B/C), but in its 1st release was still missing those scenes.  BUT!!!! Checked back several months later and someone had notified the manufacturer, and they corrected the problem!!!

Verdict:  VERY happy with this Spain release.  Sound is excellent (Says English is 2.0, but from the sound of it, they took the 5.1 music and background soundtrack they remixed for the Spanish 5.1 track, and added it to the English 2.0 dialogue as well.  So even though the dialogue is just in stereo, you still hear everything else all around.  Cool.  :-)",1433721600,48,1191,4.5829383886255926
2677859,1,B000JMKI10,"WHY ISN'T THIS MOVIE PRODUCED IN USA ON BLUE RAY WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES? WHEN I SEE ALL OF THE LOW  MOVIES THAT ARE BEING CONVERTED, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ONE IS BEING OVERLOOKED! PLEASE PLEASE",1433721600,5,203,4.342105263157895

2677864,5,B000JMKI10,"I love this DVD...this series is one of the best ones I have ever seen...Robert Powell played the most compassionate, loving and powerful Jesus ever.

2677876,5,B000JMKI10,The best picture ever made of the life and death of Jesus. More important is his message of  God of our Salvation and forgiveness by his dead in the Cross and later resurrection. Powerful and loving message for all ages.,1431302400,3,220,4.5
2677877,5,B000JMKI10,"Might be an old film; however, quality and cast of characters are simply amazing!  This film, along with Passion of The CHRIST, helped give me a new appreciation of CHRIST's love and sacrifice for humanity.",1429488000,,206,4.885714285714286

2677880,5,B000JMKI10,"Best of the Jesus movies. Outdoes all the rest. Stellar acting by an array of international stars who make every part, small or large, of Oscar quality. Ann Bancroft, Laurence Olivier, Anthony Quinn, Ernest Borgnine, Olivia Hussey, James Mason.......and many more. Great musical score, brilliant photography, directing.",1428364800,3,319,5.808510638297872
2677881,5,B000JMKI10,"I have watched this movie for some 15-17 years now and it never fails to show forth a deeper message for the times.

2677885,5,B000JMKI10,"The movie is a masterpiece, no need to comment on it. I just want to mention that the imported Blu-ray from Spain WORKS IN THE US, in any bluray player. It says ""Region B"" in the box but it's actually REGION-FREE. Good picture quality, until Liongate or someone releases a remaster for the US, THIS IS THE VERSION TO BUY.",1422316800,22,321,4.366666666666666
2677896,5,B000JMKI10,"This is one of the most acurate accounts of the life of Jesus I have viewed yet.

Each detail is a factual account separated from the myths, such as the magi were not present at the birth of Jesus, nor right after. They did not meet Jesus until he was about 6 months old.

Unfortunately as is usually the case, Jesus is depicted as the traditional skinny, almost frail, soft spoken, long flowing haired caucasion while all the other characters are dark skinned mediterraneans with strong features, rich deep voices, and wirey hair.",1421798400,3,531,4.698924731182796

2677898,5,B000JMKI10,Purchase as a Christmas gift for my mom. She has the old VHS tapes and let a friend borrow it some time back and unfortunately it came back beyond repair. Viewed it on Christmas with the family and the quality was excellent.,1419984000,2,224,4.357142857142857
2677899,5,B000JMKI10,I saw it first at television about 30 years ago and recorded it on VHS video tape. This film made me love Jesus. I saw it repeatedly so video tape was worn out so I bought DVD after a few years but I was disappointed at its low quality. But at last I found this blue ray and am very pleased with high quality of vision. I want to give my thanks to someone who made it and share this film with whoever love Jesus.,1418169600,7,412,3.8588235294117648
2677900,5,B000JMKI10,"It was everything I remember.  This is by far the best movie made about Jesus ever, even though is it was made for television.  I would love to see this remade in a theatrical version.  Probably couldn't be six hours long, maybe four.",1405468800,2,234,4.395348837209302
2677901,5,B000JMKI10,Great movie great director great acting and great service. Best movie about Jesus Christ life. A must see every Easter...,1400716800,9,121,5.1
2677902,5,B000JMKI10,Just as good from the 1980's when I first viewed it. Robert Powell did an outstanding performance of Jesus!!  Jam up star cast too!,1400284800,8,131,4.458333333333333
2677903,4,B000JMKI10,"I was a bit worried when the cover was in Italian, or European Spanish. Not sure, but I don't read or speak it. The movie was originally produced in English with English actors and the English audio is perfectly synced. A real plus is that, unlike reviews of other DVD products of poor image quality, no such problem exists here. It WAS produced in 480 and is still in that format. But it has obviously been up-converted as the image quality is quite good -- about as good as most ""high def"" DirecTv programs except that the 480 square format is still present unless you want stretched out faces by going  widescreen - not recommended.
The movie, itself, I think, is the best ""Jesus movie"" ever done. Much hoopla has been made of more recent productions of Jesus' life but none have the impact this one makes. I'm glad to have it in my video library now, finally.",1398988800,26,863,4.462025316455696
2677904,5,B000JMKI10,"The attention to accurately presenting the story based on the Gospels and the quality of the movie, actors and geography settings makes this the best movie of all time on the story of Jesus, his life and the apostles. The scenes are so well researched to depict accurately  the gospels and how life reallly was during this time is what makes this movie.",1396137600,19,353,4.603174603174603

8152296,5,B000JMKI10,"BEAUTIFUL.  I only got this for Jesus of Nazareth.  The film is a masterpiece.  It's the only way to get the complete version on Bluray.  It's easy to navigate and change the language option to English. And, the picture quality is stunning.  The DVD I've had does not begin to compare at all.  I am so glad I got this on Bluray.  And, thank God there is at least one version that is complete.  The English Bluray is a lie.  Has missing scenes.  The company knows it and continues to lie, cheat, and steal to sell their screwed up version.",1513036800,4,538,4.29

8152302,5,B000JMKI10,"As is mentioned several times here, this is the best video version of Christ's ministry taken from the book of Luke.  The sequences may be a little out of order, if you want order read your Bible.  But you can't miss with this edition.  I have watched this several dozen times and it matches the Biblical canon very closely.  You won't be disappointed.  Got the VHS in the early 90's (two VHS tapes) and have the DVD.  No other version can compare to this version, plain and simple, as is the Gospels and the way of salvation.",1484006400,2,526,4.371134020618556
