Needs maps, pov, narration, music and it just goes on and on.  I cannot believe that I paid for this thing.  I have learned my lesson, READ THE REVIEWS.",1351209600,,325,4.4576271186440675
8283329,3,B001BJ032Y,"They had the funds to put together a decent reenactment, so why not add maps? Pictures during the time? It could have been so much more descriptive, instead it is just shots of solders firing at each other with a few lines of information every 5 minutes.",1337904000,,254,4.425531914893617
8283330,2,B001BJ032Y,"Was excited to get a video on Cooch's Bridge!  However, I was very much disappointed when the video is poorly done.  There were a few tid bits of information on the engagement that became known as the battle of Cooch's Bridge but the video is very disjointed - using reenactors - and not edited to show a very cohesive story of the battle of Cooch's Bridge.  A map of the battle would have helped alot as well as more information on the geography and commmanders would have been beneficial.  This looks like a video that was done with very little editing.  Very amateurish and very disappointing.",1333324800,,596,4.584905660377358
