8662603,5,B00KYIN49M,This is the Japanese version of the film and is not a combo blu ray/dvd like the American version..just the blu ray only.  It does not have English audio or English subtitles.  But you can download the subtitles on any website.  The front art is also different from the U.S. version and in my opinion this version is WAY better.,1489276800,,328,4.433333333333334
