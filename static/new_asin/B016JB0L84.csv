7474184,5,B016JB0L84,"Pros: Saw this when it played at UNLV in Vegas and really recommend it to gamers. My friend wasn't really a gamer and she liked it as well because it was more about a guy trying to go for his life long dream.
Cons: Not long enough. I had a lot of fun watching this movie and I want to see more of it! What happened on the other days? What was Jay's budget?",1448150400,,356,3.824324324324324

7474186,5,B016JB0L84,"Like the proverbial video game where you need to find the key, the sword and the gemstone to eventually locate and rescue the proverbial princess, Nintendo Quest directs average Jay to collect all the original Nintendo games - but doing so without the use of the internet, eBay, and his own already established collection.  During the film I found myself rooting for Jay several times, and the use of graphics to indicate video game tropes like budget and item hunting makes for a clever narrative.  Makes me almost want to do the same, except that I don't have a third of the budget that the filmmakers and our game hunter has.
All in all, a fine film and I found myself giving the nod of approval when the collection is complete.  I also admire that there are rarer finds across the collection than just the rarest video games - such as World of Nintendo cabinets and arcade games - that this film showcases.  Fine work, and I'm waiting for them to do the sequel when they go in search of all the Super Nintendo games.",1485820800,,1020,4.4972972972972975
7474187,1,B016JB0L84,"Overly scripted, lacking all the raw emotion of other far superior videogame documentaries.  The consistent lack of placing any monetary context to games purchased makes this very unbelievable.

7474199,4,B016JB0L84,"Yesterday I read an article about the rare NES game on ESPN and it mentioned this movie.  As I fondly remember yesteryear and playing games on the NES, I definitely wanted to check this movie out, not having very high expectations, but some hope of finding some nostalgia.

The movie is good, it mixes in very nice historical references and background information during the challenge of purchasing all the games.  The people in the movie seem very authentic, and they have short interview clips with some better known personalities in the cult gamer community.

I don't understand where others are so down on the movie.  Other reviewers cite boring, unrealistic, and an unlikable main character.  I agree that there is some information that is not transparent (prices for games), but the story is good (unless you're expecting an action film), and the main character is a real dude, with real personality issues.

I highly recommend this movie if you lived through the 80s or love gaming history.",1480377600,2,997,4.934131736526946

I enjoyed the quest in the movie and I did not have an issue with the main character. The only complaint I had while watching was the narrator/director who actually appears in the movie.

7474218,3,B016JB0L84,"It was interesting to me as a gamer and semi-collector.  The protagonist could have been more interesting, not the blah hipster we were presented with.  Maybe it was intentional because most games have a generic character as a protagonist so we can project ourselves into them and imagine ourselves in the adventure.  I don't know.

Suggestions would have been taking the very best games even if they weren't the rarest and pumping the video chock-full of trivia tidbits, get the guy excited for the commons and uncommons too because of their little quirks and stories.

No budget, no prices of carts, friends just randomly giving him Panic Restaurant, Contra Force, Bucky O'Hare, etc... completely stupid.",1472774400,,292,4.918367346938775
7474222,2,B016JB0L84,"Do you want to watch 90 minutes of a guy going around to different stores and listing off games he bought there? Well, this is the movie for you. Even as an NES collector who knows the rarities of the games, just watching some guy negotiate and buy it is not interesting (especially since prices are not discussed in the movie). You'll find plenty to nitpick if you're a collector too. Somehow there are 678 games even though the licensed set is 677, and he never gets Flintstones 2 despite it being the second or third most expensive game. These aren't really detractors to the movie, the core concept is just boring to being with.

Interspersed are generic NES history of documentary bits, random tragedy, and perhaps the worst attempt to vilify a character in a documentary ever. I think the last one was a joke though. Either way, this isn't exactly King of Kong.

In some sense, it's kind of cool seeing a bunch of different game stores and big collections. It's interesting seeing the rare games he wasn't able to find even running around 2 countries for a month. For those reasons I'll give it 2 stars.",1472688000,,1109,4.567839195979899

7474242,3,B016JB0L84,"I don't normally write reviews on Amazon but I feel like the production of this was a labor of love for old school Nintendo as well as for for the protagonist Jay. I really wish they would have included more of the negotiations and prices involved in the ""quest"", though I understand that based on everyone's comfort with negotiating there may not have been a lot to include. While entertaining, I did feel like not having use of the internet didn't mean much when Jay was essentially reaching out to friends, followed by specialty shops that already had most of the collection he was looking for. It makes sense that this was the best way to achieve the goal, but it took away from the ""hunting"" aspect.  Jay seems like a nice guy and a sensitive soul, it's nice that he had the support of his friends and family to take on this endeavor that is meaningful to him. With that being said, once the movie moved towards Jay's past experiences and the viewer understands that this is a person who maybe is lacking socially a little bit by no fault of his own, the tone changes a lot and quickly. This isn't really about getting every NES game in a short period of time, we see that this is doable with money and planning. This is about a person trying to do something meaningful, and being lucky enough to have friends that will help him achieve something even if objectively his goal isn't really an achievement so much as a purchase.  He was so timid in negotiating with anyone, I didn't really see growth in that regard, just indecisiveness. Luckily Jay's friennd seemed to pick up on that and try to help him out, but I'm guessing that's why we didn't see those scenes- It's Jay's story.  This wasn't a bad movie, but it did sort of make me sad for Jay- he seems like a nice guy trying to do something that's meaningful to him and I can't fault him for that-but it's not always great to watch. The Nintendo history bits were the best parts.",1470700800,,1940,4.41340782122905

7474244,3,B016JB0L84,"I think this would have been good as an ""episodic show"" in youtube kinda like video game chasers. It's a nice challenge to get every single NES game through physical stores only. But many scenes in the film ended up feeling a bit the same. It's just the same scenes of him going through different stores. There's really nothing in there that makes it interesting. I wished they showed us more of him haggling and negotiating. It would have been nice to see that interactions between him and the seller. I also wished they didn't allowed his childhood friends sold him games. For all we know, those were given to him in next to nothing. I also find it odd how the film reveals Jay's relationship with his father. I felt like it was unnecessary. To make it worse, his father hating him for his hobbies and that causing a rift between them is kinda weird. I mean it's a very petty thing to cause a long broken relationship with. I feel like there's more to Jay & his father's story but that's not even relevant to the whole film. The ending also felt so forced and inorganic.

7474249,4,B016JB0L84,"I didn't know anything about the film before I watched it. It was in my Amazon Prime Video recommendations and I thought it looked interesting. I watched it with my wife and we both liked it, but I can see why it's so polarizing. It's billed as a documentary, and if you think of it as one in the strict sense of documentaries (being fact or history-based), you will be disappointed. Think of it instead as a film about the love of old-skool Nintendo games and the love of Rob McCallum (director and narrator) for his friend Jay Bartlett (the subject of the film) and you may appreciate it more. At its heart, it's an 8-bit bro-mance. McCallum and Bartlett are two childhood friends from Canada, and this is better framed as a cross-country adventure of 2 Nintendo-loving nerds and the people they meet along the way. The premise of the story: Jay has 30 days to collect all 673 original NES games. McCallum is one helluva friend. He raised $40,000 on Kickstarter to do this film.

As a documentary about Nintendo and the gaming industry, or even the games of the NES library, it's light. The Nintendo thing is just a backdrop and it takes a backseat to the story. They could've been collecting vintage Coca-Cola can for that matter, and the story would've been largely the same. I was left wanting to know more about the story of the NES, more technical details about some of the best games, and some of the people who made them possible (musicians, designers, artists, programmers, etc). If you want that, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is not that kind of documentary. Yes, there are brief and fascinating glimpses of that, such as the appearance of Marc Ericksen, the illustrator who designed the cover of Mega Man 2,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Dudes/dp/B00004SVMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Dudes</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tetris/dp/B001QHNYZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tetris</a>, and many more, but the rest are just ordinary people. He talks about the infamous incident of how&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mega-Man/dp/B00S9WV4WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mega Man</a>&nbsp;came to be holding a pistol on the box art.

Instead, this film is largely about the human story of Jay's journey as he criss-crosses Canada and large swaths of the US with the 4-member documentary crew on one massive road-trip (he's afraid to fly). There's a lot of hyperbole in the film about how great the NES and its games were. Granted, Nintendo has some of the most iconic and culturally-important characters and franchises ever created, but let's be honest here. There was also a huge amount of shovelware. Nostalgia is warm and fuzzy.

Several glaring flaws in the documentary that annoyed us:

How much money did he have to spend? We didn't like that no prices were ever shown when he made purchases. McCallum states in the film that this was a deliberately decision so that the viewer focuses on the story, but I think it's somewhat disingenuous. No knowing became a nagging question in my mind during the entire film.

I would've liked more time spend on the actual games themselves. They're treated as just lump-sum commodities and not really part of the story, besides the handful that are rare, and even then, game footage was almost never shown. The number counter jumps dozens at a time without so much as a mention of the games acquired in each lump. I wanted to see more of the individual games and them being talked about in terms of graphics, gameplay, or what memories Jay and Rob had of them. Metroid and the first Megaman, for example, I still remember seeing and playing for the first time and being completely mesmerized. Jay and Rob likely have similar fond memories of their favorites.

Aside from that, I understand that McCallum had a very precise time constraint and a unique premise. Meeting the original creators of the games would've been cost and time prohibitive (necessitating a trip to Japan, since Konami, Capcom, Bandai, Taito, SNK, and many publishers of Nintendo games are Japanese). There are some sad moments in the film like family dynamics, and we liked that McCallum touched on those. I would've liked to learn more about what Jay does (he's in a band, and works as a manager of a game store).

Overall, as children of the 80's, we enjoyed this film.",1469836800,3,4434,5.15855354659249

7474251,2,B016JB0L84,"Wow.  Wow!  That film was stunningly bad.  I enjoyed the documentaries ""King of Kong,"" ""Trekkies,"" ""Bronies,"" and have an unnatural love of ""Helvetica.""  I say that so that when I say this is bad, it is clear that it is not the genre, it is the production, and possibly the on screen personalities of the people involved.  I think everyone is probably a good normal person in real life - but they don't translate well on film, instead coming off as annoying.  The documentary spent no time playing any of the games acquired, and explained very little about the games themselves.  Okay - so it is about the collecting I thought.  But a lot of the time is spent watching him look at games.  Like, leaning over cartridges and saying, ""Hmmmm....""  They talk about negotiating but most of that is done off camera.  A surprising amount of time is spent telling the story of the main collector's relationship with his father, which is both sad (poor guy, bad relationship with dad, I am so sorry for you...), and glommed onto the movie for no reason in an insensitive way.  The ending... I can't.  I can't even express without spoiling the level of whu-huh disappointment.  Side note - the lead looks like the bass singer in Pentatonix.  Some of the most interesting moments (and all the non-white male people) appear at the very beginning, and in the credits.

I watched a bit and started skipping ahead just to see what happens, wasn't surprised by the outcome, but was a bit stumped by the ""life lesson"" our hero walked away with.  At least he did readily admit the pursuit of every Nintendo game wasn't the most noble deed ever chased (not that I'm saying it's ignoble, just silly.)

The movie's focal point is around a guy who is dared by his buddies to collect every game Nintendo ever made in the span of 30 days without using modern technology (eBay, Craigslist).

He gets emotionally involved as the quest goes on, although I'm not sure why as it seemed like it was a bet made by drinking buddies or when shooting the breeze with your friends.  By the end, you want him to succeed though and you get a look into how deep the rabbit hole is that many collectors climb into.

7474296,2,B016JB0L84,"A guy named Jay from southern Ontario, Canada, takes up the challenge of acquiring all of the officially-licensed, North American-released games for the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The catch? He has only thirty days to do it, and he's not allowed to use the Internet in any way.

The quest starts off slowly, with visits to Jay's local friends and neighbors who have old NES games to donate to the cause, but it quickly turns into a cross-country road trip. Jay and the film crew visit used game stores, flea markets, and even private residences, trying to snag copies of even the rarest and most obscure games. (One particular cartridge by the name of ""Stadium Events"" becomes Jay's holy grail. Although few people have ever heard of it, collectors apparently are willing to pay thousands of dollars for it.)

The production values are a little tacky, a little amateur, but if you're a fan of NES, this could be worth watching for nostalgic value. However, it is very repetitive--there's a ton of footage of Jay staring intently at shelves of used games and haggling with shopkeepers--and there is almost no gameplay footage at all. Again: watch this if you grew up with NES, but don't set your expectations too high.",1467849600,,1236,4.8530805687203795

The creative minds at the helm of the film provide ""required reading"" depth of information to understand Nintendo as a company in the NES/Famicom era, and give the conflict of the film context (getting all 678 North American released NES cartridges/games - even the rare ones).

I gave it 4/5 stars because the film really gets into some powerful aspects of collector culture, gamer culture, and fandom in general; what Jay Bartlett goes through could be experienced by people interested in many things aside from video games.  The production team delivers on their intent, but my selfish hope for more information into cartridge and title release history, beyond the rare titles, doesn't really happen.

It's a film that does what it says, and provides some nice entertainment by complicating Jay's collection process and drawing-in some personal stories that were surprising.  Nintendo Quest is a must for those interested in pop and collector culture.",1466985600,,1071,5.313609467455621

I'm not a gamer, but I did enjoy a lot of NES and other games when I was younger, so I understand where they are coming from wanting to make this movie. But it is just bad, really bad. It is a cool idea, but they wrapped up this guy's serious personal problems with what would have been a fun, harmless little quest. It got dark in a very strange way with his anxiety issues and the dying of his dad, grandparents and then his dog. I felt bad for him, but I didn't watch a documentary about Nintendo to get depressed. The narration is not great, but I could get over that and there is absolutely no doubt that they are Canadian. But honestly I didn't expect a big production, I just thought it would be a lighthearted story about a guy trying to buy a bunch of rare games. What I got was a scattered, unexpectedly sad story that left out a ton of details (how much he spent was the big one) and went the wrong way with what could have been a cool idea.",1466035200,4,1181,4.051282051282051

7474388,3,B016JB0L84,"Being a feature length 'Challenge Video', this is pretty on-point.  If you're into the subject matter, it's an entertaining watch, and a well-done effort.

I'm not sure it could appeal to anyone that doesn't already have an interest in the Nintendo collecting scene, hence the 3-star rating.

Lots of the information that time is spent on is more-or-less common knowledge (or at least tribal knowledge), so the target audience ends up sitting through things they already are familiar with, or could have deduced.

Other interesting bits pertaining to the story are glossed over on an almost superficial level (fear of flying... Reasons for delays, etc.)

I'm not blaming the filmmaker or participants for these.  I'm sure extenuating circumstances exist for all of it.  Just giving my impressions of the final production.

If you loved the NES, it's probably worth a watch.  If you're fascinated by the collecting scene, then likewise.

7474397,1,B016JB0L84,"""Nintendo Quest"" is supposed to be a documentary about a man's commitment to collecting all of the original Nintendo cartridges to fulfill a personal goal.  But instead of that, it's actually about a ""filmmaker"" who dares his half-hearted friend into collecting the games under a frivolous set of rules with no consequence for failing.  He's supposed to collect all the official Nintendo games in thirty days, and not buy any online.  Ok, that's fine, but....

This documentary was unnecessary in all ways.  The main subject, Jay, was in constant on-screen communication with the documentary crew, which defeats the purpose of pretty much any documentary, and didn't really seem all that interested in the quest that he was ASKED TO DO by the director, Robert McCallum.  In no ways did Jay mention this was his goal or desire or anything of the sort - it is mentioned he likes video games, but that can be said for almost everyone in their age group.  There was no personal stake or desire to achieve the goal of collecting all the cartridges, but instead it was something they did on a whim at the REQUEST OF THE FILMMAKER.  That's not what a documentary is and it immediately destroys any feelings of risk, reward, or excitement.

In addition to the already pointless premise, the people shown on screen lack any real charisma or interesting qualities.  I'm not saying they don't seem like decent people - I'm sure I'd like to hang out and play games with them - but as far as creating an interesting challenge or journey for us viewers to tag along with them on, everything just feels so inconsequential.  SPOILER ALERT:  Jay does not finish his ""Nintendo Quest"" by the end of thirty days.  But whatever.  There's a text blurb saying he didn't do it, then they cut to eight months later where he just bought all the games on EBay.  We rarely get any sort of interesting action on film - anything POTENTIALLY interesting is doled out to the viewer via text using that ""8-Bit Font"" you can find on any website or is reminisced about on-screen after the event happened.  This is a visual medium, people!  We want to see what you did, with who, and see how it made you feel.  Like they say, ""show, don't tell"" your stories on film.

Most of the ""film"" is spent watching a small collection ticker count higher and higher after Jay and crew visit video game stores, with Jay showing boxes in the back of a van.  You rarely see the haggling process, the hurdles that they needed to overcome, and you aren't really clued in on exactly how much money they're willing to spend.  They make hints to it and mention numbers a few times, but it's all irrelevant because the ""budget"" replenishes when they need it to.  Really, there's nothing at stake here - no pride, no conquest, no feelings of dread or fulfillment - just a couple of guys buying video games and stacking them on shelves.  I can and do do that at home, except that gives me some sort of feelings, unlike this movie.

Not only did I get nothing emotional or thoughtful out of ""Nintendo Quest"", I really didn't get to see any fun or clever interactions among people either.  Interactions were between old friends who simply gave games away (thus defeating the point of a budget) or between Jay, the director, and merchants, giving us a very impersonal look at the ""community"" they wanted so desperately to show us.  Jay didn't have to go outside of his comfort zone or really grow as a person in any way, even if the movie really tried its best to trick us into thinking he did.  Nothing, at any time, was ever at stake.  Except for Jay's dog, who apparently got sick in the middle of filming, which they jammed into the middle of it all to force us to feel sad.

I wanted to like this movie.  The premise seemed fun and interesting, but everything was just so forced and without consequence that I really couldn't find myself invested in it.  Sorry Robert McCallum and crew; better luck next time!",1465516800,4,3953,4.5803698435277385

7474405,2,B016JB0L84,"I love video games, so naturally I was really interested in this film when I saw it pop up on my Fire TV. The ""quest"" is a bit of a flimsy premise for a documentary, but I gave it a shot. The quest is hunting down (the almost) complete NES library within 30 days without using eBay or the rest of the internet to assist Jay Bartlett in his journey. The ""rules"" seem pretty cut and dry and should make for a really, tough challenge...but Jay and his documentary team essentially use loopholes within the rule structure to obtain a significant portion of the collection. For example, Jay gets access to world class collector's secret stashes. That's a privilege that an average person wouldn't be able to get. So while Jay is slightly handcuffed by the rules, he also gets breaks that someone with no ties to the collecting community would ever get or even know about. I understand that Jay and the filmmakers are involved in this community but I felt like this sort of cheapened the premise of the quest. What's the difference in using the internet to find games or using a previous connection (likely made on the internet) to find the games? While the filmmaker introduces us to Jay and gives us a brief bio on him, we never really get to know him (if that makes sense). We're told that Jay is a musician, loves games, Star Wars, music, works at a game store, and loves Dave Grohl. While this biographical summary is nice, we don't really step into Jay's life but very, very briefly. He tells a very emotional story about his father which sheds some light on his character but this is the only real foray into Jay Bartlett's life. I think the film would have been better served to cut some of the Nintendo history lessons that are interspersed throughout the film and focus more on Jay's life. Other than being encouraged by the filmmaker to do this quest, it seems like we don't really get an answer as to why Jay participates in the film. One curious omission from the film is the cost of the games that Jay has to buy. This is an important part of the story that is completely left out of the film. What kind of financial commitment does it take to do obtain this collection? What kind of deals was he able to negotiate? I think this was a kickstarter funded film, were the game purchases funded by the filmmakers? It's only natural to want to see a running total (or any total) of the price of the games in a film about buying games.

I don't know, I guess I'm a jerk, but you can see this guy starts mailing it in when he has to deal with the real world. He lives at home, complains about his dad and quotes Dave Grohl. I'd say he's a walking millennial stereotype, but sadly I think he's older. You can see the film producer's frustration with this kid's lack of motivation during his interviews.

What should be a really fun movie turns into some dude complaining about nothing. He doesn't even reach his goal. Shocker, I know.

That being said, it was still fun to watch.  'Stadium Events' is not worth $77,000 and I am sure he got it for less than eBay was asking.  While this was an interesting trip down memory lane, I wished some big names had made an appearance - like Steve Wiebe or Billy Mitchell (he might have had a cameo), Shigero Miyamoto, Howard Phillips, or Phil Rogers.  Who are those last two you say?  People I met at Nintendo of America and better known in the late 80's.  Phil and his wife were my neighbors in Bothell, Washington and he retired as an Executive VP of Operations at Nintendo.  I was one of the first to receive a gold copy of 'The Legend of Zelda' before the general public could find out the many rewards from playing it.  I got to tour the facility and had many a barbecue with Phil and his wife.  They were nice people.  I also went to the Nintendo World Championship, however did not win.  Luckily there were smaller competitions that I did win - free Gameboys and games.  I remember they had ads from the companies like 'Sega does what Nintendon't' and 'SNES is what Genesisn't'.  I made my own ads (not televised) like 'Saturn runs rings around not so Super Nintendo', 'N64 does significantly more than Saturn', 'Dreamcast is so much more a blast than N64', and 'GameCube makes Dreamcast look like a noob'.  I even made video game newsletters, video game raps, and presented video game quizzes to some people online.  But enough about my life.

7474457,1,B016JB0L84,"When I discovered that this existed I couldn't get my hands on it fast enough. Going cross country in an attempt to buy every Nintendo game ever made. How could this be bad? Well... It was. And it wasn't just bad, it was reaaaaalllllllly bad.

So the fella we're following on his quest, Jay, is just painful. He's painful to watch in so many ways. In reality he seems like a nice guy, but he's also just insufferable. For some reason, rather than focusing on the games and turning up the nostalgia factor everyone watching this is clamoring for, we get inundated with these poorly shot, even worse edited shots of Jay insinuating how hard his life has been and still is.

I'm putting two and two together here and assuming that the man behind the Doc wanted to take us on this journey with Jay where he ""comes out of his shell"", and where he ""finds himself"". What you end up getting is a nonsensical, muddled, all over the place story of a spoiled white Canadian dude that is painfully insecure, has anxiety and Daddy issues, and frankly comes off as extremely disingenuous, and whiny.

What nuggets they do give us paint a picture of a man in his, oh, probably early to mid 30's? He has a dog, is obsessed with Star Wars, and works in a video game store. So, really he's got a Peter Pan complex, and is no different than the one or two guys that we all know in our own hometown, and/or from High School. He thinks nice guys finish last, that all good women are with jerks that don't treat them well, he's the ""the bigger man walks"" away type. He's so Canadian it hurts. He's shy, awkward, and non-confrontational without any of the occasional charm that can be associated with such traits.

What is meant to be a journey is nothing more than a flat, dull slog of 100 minutes. What I suppose was supposed to be some sort of triumph for him gets lost in the amateur storytelling. In the end this a guy that has enough money to buy nearly 700 games (Some of which cost $4,000/each), AND can take a month off of work to do it. He appears healthy, is White, lives in Canada so he's got free insurance and all sorts of other Socialist type goodies. He lives in what appears to be a nice area, and seems to have a lot of equally dorky friends. What the hell are you so sad about?

This may seem like a harsh review, but I had to share it. I just couldn't stop myself. I seldom write reviews, but this one required my time and effort. I've never seen someone seemingly as privileged be so downtrodden and unlikable. It's really quite stunning.",1464048000,8,2536,4.341772151898734

I found myself fast forwarding through most of the fluff thrown in it, because it all felt like it was droning on without any real purpose to the film.  You could even tell at points that the film maker was hyping it up ON CAMERA to mean more than it should; in the end it's still just some rich guy with no problems over coming a bout of infant mood-swings over not getting the games that he wants.  The ending was even more forced, it was so clear that this unlikable main character had not grown at all and yet we are being told he did, just to portray some sort of false point to the film.

The narrator is one of the biggest problems of this film. We are told at the beginning that Jay is about to do the hardest thing he has even had to do. Which turns out to be buying things. Think about that. It's not very compelling. Nor does it seem that hard. We are never told the budget, we are not shown most of the transactions, and most of the games are bought locally within a couple of days. It doesn't really seem like a big deal to the guy. He seems to have a really great life and this just a fun aside.
At one point Jay tells a story of his father. He doesn't like his father but the only reason given is the father didn't like Star Wars and video games. If these are the only issues that seems awfully vain to me. If there were deeper issues why not go into them? If it's too much it should not be brought up at all.
There are good bits where they have little bits of interviews from people in gaming but it's not enough.

There are some things I wish they would of mentioned, like the budget, and the cost of some of the purchases. One thing I fully doubt they did not use the internet in any way shape or form to accomplish all of this, as they had a whole route mapped out I don't see how you can in this day find out where all of these locations were (phonebook, yeah right) without fully scouting out and pulling a bunch of info from the web or other were using the web to help locate sources especially if the main person had never been to the US i find it impossible to believe, and other people reaching out because they (magically)  heard yeah the internet fully was used to the max maby not to physically purchase but it would of been more of a challenge to have really not used the internet.
All in all that was my only gripe with the story, but its more about the people and there undying love and passion for collecting gamers who grew up in the 2000's will not get it as the games are trash comparably, and ownership is a thing of the past (you pay for a game and get nothing really it's all digital copies) so collecting is not even something that young kids understand.",1462060800,,1249,4.161157024793388

While, I do agree with other reviewers, it would have been nice to know what Jay's budget was, overall...this is a solid film for anyone who still loves the NES. It isn't without flaw, as it could have been a little longer, told more of the story (only 90 minutes, which is kind of short in Documentary film...which normally is between 15-30 minutes longer on average), but visually speaking, was a really good effort, you want to root for Jay to complete the quest because it feels like he's doing it for everyone who will never get to do it themselves. If you are a nintendo fan, if you are a child of the 1980's or if you love collecting video games and playing video games. This will help you remember why you love it so much. Now, if you are looking for the kind of movie that takes itself too seriously or is about a serious subject matter....this isn't for you. This is a movie that is meant for the fans of the product, but if you are someone who's looking for a documentary strictly about the history of games, then you can find more detailed stuff on youtube.

This is a fun film where it delivers to all audiences, be it they are avid gamers/collectors or just into documentary movies, you will feel the ups and downs as the two friends soon discover on their journey...or should I say their quest.  Filled many gaming celebrities and personalities, this soon to be classic should not be missed by anyone.  And chances are, after watching this movie, you are going to want to fire up your old NES system or find a way to do so.",1449100800,2,653,4.5

We only dreamed as kids to own every single NES cart.  Now this guy makes his dream a reality! or does he?  Check out the Quest... the Nintendo Quest!  Good for all ages to watch!  Shot and edited great with tons of cameos from video game greatNESs-es!",1449100800,2,553,5.936708860759493
7474500,4,B016JB0L84,"Great documentary that made me wish I had kept up with my NES games/boxes from my childhood. Like another reviewer said, only downside is they don't reveal the prices he paid for some of the games! Such a disappointment as this would have been absolutely one of the most interesting parts of the film.",1449014400,,301,4.592592592592593
7474501,3,B016JB0L84,Great movie but no game prices.....really?  That really hurts it for me. How could you leave the most important thing out?,1449014400,3,122,4.809523809523809
7474502,5,B016JB0L84,Have had the pleasure to see this movie twice now and simply said even if you are not into video games there is a human element to this film that cannot be missed. This not only was one of the biggest surprises of this year but one of the top five films of 2015 period. This movie is worth every penny for gaming enthusiasts and non gamers alike and is an experience not to be missed.,1448323200,3,384,4.065789473684211
7474503,5,B016JB0L84,"I have the fundraiser edition of this DVD and movie. This is not only a great movie about the history of a video game company and their ideas, the console and its media, and the era it was introduced to but also about the community it effected all along the way and through a great device that is very human. This documentary about a dare to try to gather all of one idea together from nostalgia, then ends up being more about testing people without technology blocking the interactions and testing one person's way of thinking for the better, regardless of the ending, is priceless. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If you like even just seeing the trivia portions of every Nintendo Entertainment System video game, you will have a happy bonus surprise of a really great movie.",1448150400,3,778,4.644927536231884

8736640,3,B016JB0L84,"Decent movie that makes me want to hunt out some better quality game shops, but other than that, two criticisms:
1.  You HAVE to show the budget and prices!  The main guy is stressed over pricing most of the time so let us in on it!
2.  ""No using the Internet for help"".  They say they can't use the net, but many of the connections are made and arranged through the net!  I thought it was going to be a true blind 30 day quest.  It wasnt.",1526169600,,439,3.9885057471264367
8736641,1,B016JB0L84,This is not the movie you were looking for. What could have been an awesome movie about two best friends road-tripping across America collecting and discussing classic video games is instead a depressing ego trip for the unlikable main character who seems miserable the whole time and talks about how awesome it was when his father died....yeah. Not worth your time or mine. Nintendo should sue to have their name taken off this tripe.,1524700800,,435,4.891891891891892
8736642,5,B016JB0L84,Anyone who clicked on this needs to watch!  This is a fantastic journey and a well made film.  I wish I had the resources and time to do this.  Great job guys!,1518393600,,159,3.90625
8736643,5,B016JB0L84,It entertained me and I like Nintendo games and video games in general.,1517270400,,71,4.538461538461538

8736646,1,B016JB0L84,"This is the greatest film in the history of great films.  It not only contains audio but also video as well.  There was a guy with a sneer and a guy with a beard, and beard guy wanted to buy all the video games.  So he went and bought all the video games.  There were no commercial breaks, which was good.  Plenty of parking.  Would not recommend this movie to people who are blind, don't have a computer, and live in a bomb shelter.  People who live in bomb shelters will want to stock their bomb shelters with better movies than this, and also food.  Also would not recommend this movie to people who live in boats.  Also would not recommend this movie to people who work in Walmarts, Macy's, or Pier 1 Imports.  Also would not recommend this movie to human beings or residents of the planet Earth.  Would not recommend this movie to aliens either.",1508630400,2,850,4.350318471337579
8736647,1,B016JB0L84,So you just walk into your friends house and he give you Snow Bros and Contra Force???? Yeah this is not actually acquiring a collection it's about friends giving him rare games and him most likely just bringing them back after the movie ended. Garbage and fake.,1507248000,10,262,4.595744680851064
8736648,1,B016JB0L84,The makers of this doc were too close to the project and made the mistake of thinking people would be interested in some guy's random decision to collect a bunch of games. They gloss over the details most viewers would be interested in (such as the pricing and background to classic NES games) and spend a lot of time congratulating themselves for growing up in the 80's and 90's and being best friends. When the main character started talking about his relationship with his dad I turned the movie off because they obviously were never going to go into the interesting aspects of collecting NES games. If you are interested in the history of NES then check out Cinnamassacre and Gaming Historian's YouTube channels and skip this masturbatory bro-fest.,1505692800,13,752,4.837209302325581
