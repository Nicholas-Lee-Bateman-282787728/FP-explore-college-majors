3872470,5,B0028ERCAC,This was the first time back to Daytona since the death of Dale Earnhardt. When you watch the last few laps you can't help but get emotional and cheer on Dale Jr. to get to the front and win the race.,1363305600,,200,3.902439024390244

3872472,5,B0028ERCAC,I get emotional every time I watch this race because Dale Jr. dominated the race and it seemed that his father was on the track once again.  There is so much emotion in this race for everyone at Daytona that night.,1361491200,,214,4.219512195121951
3872473,5,B0028ERCAC,jr kicked some serious ass in this one. his car was so good that he dropped back on purpose to see how long it'd take him to get back to the front. lol. he lead 116 of 160. towards the end he used the side draft to pass cars by himself like no other driver can. he can draft like only his old man could. they are the kings of rp racing. i remember watchin this live in 01 freakin out cause he'd just won at the track that took his dad the legend. good stuff.,1282867200,,458,3.78125
3872474,5,B0028ERCAC,"For Junior to win the next Daytona race after his father died in the 500 was a moving event to all racing fans.

8356125,4,B0028ERCAC,"This is from the standard definition era of TV broadcasting. The picture is tolerable, for a DVD of a TV broadcast.
My disc did have a couple of tiny moments of visual distortion. Just a couple of cracks and pops. Nothing that totally ruins the experience. If you were an Earnhardt fan, and felt hurt after the 2001 Daytona 500, this race will put a smile on your face again.",1392249600,,375,4.371428571428571
8356126,1,B0028ERCAC,"I was very excited to watch this race because I like to watch old races. So when I try to watch this movie it doesn't work in my DVD player. This movie is nothing but a recorded race that is burned on a blank disc. Don't believe me, my mom took the sticker off the blank disc. Please believe this I was basically ripped off and I hope it doesn't happen to anyone else.",1386547200,,368,3.9864864864864864
