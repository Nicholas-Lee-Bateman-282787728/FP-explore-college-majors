Trying to explain its appeal may prove difficult.  It is a vulgar spoof fraught with smutty innuendo and bad jokes that work because they are so bad.  It's packed with male and female nudity that more often than not makes perfect sense in the scheme of things.  Most of the action takes place on the planet Porno Mongo and involves rapist-robots and Penisaurus creatures, among many other odd sight gags and utter nonsense.

She was living with Danny Osco when he made this film and the original film was Hard Core and much longer than 90 minutes.  A lot of the female cast became pregnant during the filming.
BUT, Danny promised to edit the film to soft core at the insistance of ""Dale Ardor'.
THIS is the film you see on Amazon.

Later Danny and ""dale"" had a falling out and Danny released the unedited hard-Core version in Europe in revenge.

So, somewhere out there, probably in Europe, is the Hard-Core version of Flesh Gordon with many scenes that Danny had cut from the American version.

When we got into watching the movie I could see that many of her concerns were being repressed by what she was seeing on the screen, which I later found had touched some of her latent sexual tendancies. She had found it 'exciting' and had ultimately enjoyed it, and later confessed that it had in fact turned her on, her favorite scene being the lesbian initiation with Dale Ardor strapped to a table with another woman straddling her face, where though 'simulated', there are definite touches of forced oral. It ultimately proved to be a quite an erotic stimulus for her imagination. Though by today's standards it is far from being what one would call 'porn', it is a fun and campy film to watch, and the very fact that it goes back to a time in my life that was so open and uninitiated to all things sexual, it is one that will be on my shelf, if not just for the memories..",1209168000,,1161,4.354838709677419

The film is ostensibly a sex- and innuendo-loaded parody of the FLASH Gordon movies I remember watching on Channel 52 back in the 1970s when I was a kid, and of course I knew they were from another era, the Depression. The makers of ""Flesh Gordon"" were very successful at tongue-in-cheek humor with this film.

I will state for the record that I find the average dirty movie to be boring as hell... however, this movie did not bore me, but rather, it made me laugh! I guess it just has to do with the way the actors all maintain deadpan seriousness, as they blurt out the most hilariously farcical dirty jokes.

When I was a kid, my mother had an uncle who always used to go see this film whenever some art-house theater in downtown Los Angeles would show it... and the rest of the family would know, because every time after he watched it, he'd always barge in on the rest of us, and rattle off about how he went to see ""Flesh Gordon"" and oh, it was always so funny.

The humor is basically Kentucky Fried Movie and Groove Tube type camp...  funny almost ""Rocky Horror-esque"" lines, and over the top scenarios.  - - The film is most interesting because the low budget special effects are pretty good (the FX team seems to take up half the credits and one of them went on to DIRECT the THE HELLS HAVE EYES), yet at the same time it is definitely a NUDIE of that era...

It is juvenile. It is crass. The film quality and some of the acting left a bit to be desired. But for all that, it's funny and a great send-up of the original.

However, despite the film's accomplishments, its novelty begins to wear thin after the first ten minutes, and then you're just left with poor, sophomoric humour which quickly becomes sleep-inducing.

And so our hero Flesh, his lady love Dale Ardor, and their scientific genius Dr. Jerkoff set out for planet Porno to defeat Wang... only to find themselves victims of his REALLY kinky ways!  As film-making goes, the quality of this parody is often quite poor, the material itself is extremely uneven, and the performers merely so-so--but what the filmmakers lack in experience they more than make up for in imagination.

That is true; after all, even MIDNIGHT COWBOY was rated X, if you can imagine it.  Even so, there is considerable nudity and simulated sex in FLESH GORDON, and during one or two of the crowd scenes it seems obvious that at least one of the couples is well gone into X territory.

This DVD is NOT for your 13 year olds. Those of you who remember the 70's like I do, will want this DVD for your library. If you do NOT remember the Flash Gordon Series or Movie (Queen soundtrack) you will view this with utterly aghast amazement (hard to believe they had this kind of Mitchell Brothers humor 30 years ago), but you still appreciate the Young Frankenstein approach. This movie was made cheaply, cheesy, and superbly. Trust me. I am never wrong.",994896000,,1473,4.691119691119691

736239,5,6303950000,"This movie is the origianl spoof, others have tried since but this movie has it all.  Remember all the old 1950's space type movies with the planets swinging on string in the background?  Well this has that too.  It has to be watched to be believed.  Fantastic... I laughed from  beginning to the end.  The fine detail is fantastic.  Its actually been  filmed to appear corny.
You cannot go in expecting ""Star Wars""  here.  This is in a league of its own as far as Sci-Fi goes.  When this  first showed at cinema's people were shocked at some scenes, as they are a  bit raunchy, but I feel these help add to the flavour.
If you've got an  hour and a half to just let your mind go, and don't want to concentrate too  much this is great stress reliever.",962236800,,751,4.264285714285714
736240,4,6303950000,"This movie is hilarious with numerous sight gags and spoken ones. The eroticism is silly but, fitting to the point Ziehm is making. It is like a NC - 17 version of Saturday Night Live. The picture quality of the DVD is  the best it could be for the age and budget of the film. I was disappointed  with the special features, or the lack of rather. Also there is no insert  in the DVD which left me feeling slightly cheated. This is a good  investment if you want laugh at the pure lunacy of this flick.",955324800,,501,4.134020618556701
736241,4,6303950000,"Even though the acting in this movie is so over the top it is laughable, this one is definately enjoyable. Watching the string hold up the space ship as it flies across the screen was a highlight for me. It does remind  me of Caligula a bit with some of the erotic scenes. All in all, a fun  spoof on sci-fi.",953078400,,308,4.032786885245901
736242,3,6303950000,"In my earlier review I stated that it was a close call between the DVD and the VHS version of this movie.  At that time, I hadn't found the director's audio commentary.  It is mentioned on the case but is not listed in the  disk's menu.  It is on the disk, though, and can be turned on using the  player's ""audio"" control.  Howard Ziehm's commentary doesn't  track the action in the movie or run half the length of the movie, but it  is an amusing and informative account of what went into making this cult  classic.  That, plus the additional footage and the marginally better video  and sound, makes the DVD a clear winner over the VHS version, in my  opinion.",949536000,,662,4.380165289256198
736243,3,6303950000,"Flesh Gordon has achieved the status of a minor cult film.  Although it carefully instructs the viewer not to confuse it with the real Flash Gordon, it follows the story of the first Flash Gordon serial fairly  closely, at least for the first third of the film.  Part of its cult status  comes from the campy style and humor, but mostly it is the combination of  cheesy soft-core porn with relatively decent special effects.  The DVD  shows that strange amalgamation clearly.  Overall, the picture quality is  fairly mediocre, perhaps not unexpected in a movie this age that was made  on a very low budget in the first place.  There is a lot of grain in many  of the scenes, and some of them are washed out as well.  But the worst  scenes are the live action scenes (though not all the live action scenes  are bad).  The special effect scenes, especially the stop-motion animation  scenes, are pretty good.  They are sharp and the colors are bright and  deep.  It is obvious that much more care was put into making the special  effects than into the rest of the movie.  The sound is also nothing special  and the supplemental material consists only of a trailer.  The DVD does  provide a better viewing experience than the VHS, but not a lot better.  We're not talking Dark City, here.  If you already have this movie on VHS,  it may not be worth upgrading (though the trailer, slightly better picture  and sound, attractive cover on a Alpha Keep case, and the permanence of DVD  was enough for me) but if you don't have it and want it, then the DVD is  the way to go.",949449600,,1568,4.473309608540926
736244,4,6303950000,"Buster Crabbe rolled over in his grave when this send-off of Flash Gordon came out. I should know, I saw it at least 10 times at the local theater. The acting is horrible, but it's supposed to be. I don't think anyone was  thinking Oscar here.  The effects are cheesy with the strings holding the  infamous penile ship up there for all the world to see. The women and men  are nekkid.  And it is one of the funniest movies in cinema because 1) it  doesn't take itself seriously; 2) it's played for pure camp; 3) it  titilates unceasingly.
If you're looking for low-brow fun,  late-night-cable sex, and some hearty belly laughs, Flesh Gordon is the  perfect film. Everyone has mentioned how poor a character Flesh is. True.  But how can you be anything else when you're facing such characters as  Penisauruses, Emperor Wang and his sex ray, or have a side-kick with the  name Dr. Flexi Jerkoff?
One thing to do while watching: count the  various sub-titles Wang's minions spout when addressing him. One of the  best: Your royal protruberance.
I only wish there was a truly uncut  version where the sex scenes were shown in their full glory. Some are  highly original.
Pure fun. Highly recommended.",943660800,,1196,4.677884615384615

Sorry, I am a big fan of non-mainstream movies and there are many delightful gems to be found among the less than famous or unknown movies. However, this film is not one of them. I do not mind the least the low production quality and cheap props used. Its just that the 'story' is simply vulgar and really un-funny. The acting was amateurish and the characters feel like racial and gender stereotypes. Some people may appreciate the abundance of (un-erotic) nudity and the un-PC ness of the dialogues, but I just do not find anything to enjoy about this movie.",1513468800,,588,4.609523809523809
