8047877,5,B0007KX4HO,"As along time (on and off) Judoka, I found this video very well thought out, put together, and informative. He goes over mutiple variation on each technique and even includes no gi variations for each technique. This will upgrade any players ground game (Judo or Brazilian Jiu Jitsu).",1289260800,,284,4.9375

8047879,5,B0007KX4HO,"I have been doing Judo and Jujitsu for a while and this dvd here is outstanding! Now I have his other dvd as well Judo Complete which is real great but this dvd breaks down all of his steps even more and he goes over his techniques in slow motion. If you are interested in improving your grappling game on the mat of rondori, shai, or even in the streets this dvd is a must.",1161820800,6,374,4.0
8047880,5,B0007KX4HO,"This DVD develops a very coherent approach to NE-Waza . Mike Swain presents a logical progression of attacks, from standing to ground,  fighting off one's back , attacking UKE's back and some very nice arm-lock entries.

The simplicity of presentation is first class and most of the moves are interlinked one way or another.

This tape doesn't have the clutter of other Judo or JiuJitsu tapes but presents each move correctly, explaining the finer points of each move so they really can be applied in randori or competion. The only thing thats missing is perhaps some competitive examples.",1127088000,23,589,4.989795918367347
