6650649,3,B00NGL7JK4,"It might be a sign that you're getting old, if you watch a recently released movie and keep being reminded of better ones that came out years ago.  Or it could be a sign that the movie itself is not very good.

""Men, Women and Children,"" seemed to me to have a lot of similarities to ""American Beauty.""  Both open with the main character (here it's Adam Sandler) masturbating, the implication being that he's lost any satisfaction he once had in his marriage. Both take place in suburbia, and all the characters, regardless of age, appear to be clinically depressed and groping after some kind of alternative.  But while ""American Beauty's"" characters discovered a kind of warped joy in bending the rules, ""Men, Women and Children,"" which follows a group of middle-class families as they deal with the current online/texting culture, is mostly dull and preachy.  (Spoiler)  Everyone gets their knuckles rapped for misbehaving and ends the movie as down as they began.

The movie opens with a shot of outer space and is narrated by Emma Thompson, who if she weren't kept off-screen would outshine the rest of the cast.  The film might be more exciting if it stayed in the Milky Way, but it quickly moves to suburbia.  Adam Sandler plays a grownup here and gives an admirably subdued performance as the father of a teenage son with a porn addiction.  Sandler and his own wife are dissatisfied with their relationship, and both wind up secretly seeking online diversion.  Jennifer Garner plays a mom who keeps a tighter vigilance over her daughter's online activities than the CIA.  The girl's love interest, played by Ansel Elgort, has just quit the football team, after his mom moved out, and is becoming obsessed by role playing games.  Another teen girl deals with an eating disorder (fueled by yes, the Internet) and whether or not to have sex.  Another character wants to be an actress and has a modeling website, run by her mom, who is one of those ""cool"" parents.  There are various crises and confrontations.  It is never explained why adults of this generation (I'm assuming it's ""X"") who presumably grew up with video games and computers would have such extreme reactions to their offspring's' online activities.

I wanted to give this movie a much higher rating, since it did not feature (like the last two movies I saw) a character repeatedly vomiting or being murdered during sex, but there were too many stories going on at once, many of which did not have much of a resolution, and the overall mood throughout was dreary, which is all right if the film also stimulates my brain, but here it did not.",1414108800,3,2612,4.7560975609756095
6650650,4,B00NGL7JK4,"The Internet has changed our lives. This movie explores the many ways it has infiltrated our society, particularly that of teenagers, and their parents' bewildered response. This R-rated (for VERY graphic dialogue) outing is directed by Jason Reitman (""Juno"" and ""Up in the Air"") from a script he co-wrote with Erin Cressida Wilson based on Chad Kultgen's novel by the same name.

It is shocking to my generation to see how ""wired"" modern life has become, and it is even MORE shocking to peek at someone else's correspondence. We are exposed to snippets of pornography, anorexia, chat rooms, on-line bullying, extramarital adventures and the pain of awkward teenage dating.

Here is a small part of this highly capable cast:
  * Adam Sandler (""Grown Ups"") is Don Truby, a father who has his own skill set for on-line contacts. He isn't above looking at his son's computer usage...and then his wife's... Oops!
  * Rosemarie DeWitt (""Kill the Messenger"") His wife Helen, is branching out for no good reason except possibly boredom.
  * Jennifer Garner (""Draft Day"") Patricia has mastered on-line skills so she can keep track of her daughter's life. There isn't a keystroke or a digital signal that she hasn't compulsively followed. This is a control freak run amok and we pity her poor daughter!
  * Kaitlyn Dever (""Short Term 12"") is Brandy; her mother has quickly learned the ropes of on-line networking and the girl has NO privacy.
  * Dennis Haysbert (""Think Like a Man Too"") is secretluvur, a chat room identity, who shows up right where he's supposed to.
  * Judy Greer (""Descendents"") Donna Clint is developing a new hobby...smile... Problem is, her daughter is underage and she might be breaking the law.
  * Olivia Crocicchia (""Rescue Me"") is Hannah Clint, the vain cheerleader who aspires to be on a television reality show.
  * Ansel Elgort (""The Fault in Our Stars"") Tim doesn't want to play football this year, which makes him persona non grata at school. He is a fan of Carl Sagan which leads to a big misunderstanding with the school counselor.
  * Emma Thompson (""Saving Mr. Banks"") as the narrator. Her job is to try to bridge the outer space/Carl Sagan aspect of this film with the personal trials and tribulations of teenagers and their parents.

I'm running out of space and haven't covered all of the fine performers. Each individual has his or her moment to shine and there isn't a weak performance. Bottom line, these are all good kids and the parents are doing the best they can, it's just very complicated in today's digital world.",1413936000,4,2554,4.852193995381063
6650651,3,B00NGL7JK4,"This movie is about several different men, women, and children (hence, the name) and their intersecting lives. Basically we follow a few days in the lives of a few different families. Everyone seems to have their own issues or problems that their family or friends may not be aware of.

Technology and social media are definitely very present themes throughout this movie.  One overprotective mother monitors her daughter's every movement online and in real life by checking her daughter's cell phone location, analyzing Facebook messages and texts, and tracking every keystroke. We see one teenager who is practically addicted to online porn, while another is obsessed with an online RPG. Unhappy and bored in their marriage, a couple both use the Internet to search for partners outside of their marriage.

I thought Men, Women & Children was a good movie, but it was at times a bit too risqu for me. It was a bit of a downer, as I left the movie feeling a bit depressed. I really enjoyed some storylines better than others, but felt that there were a bit too many story lines to follow. I felt the movie suffered as a result of the many competing storylines. At the end of the movie, I thought there were some character's plot lines that had been left unresolved and I didn't have as much closure as I would have preferred.

This movie contains a lot of familiar faces, including Adam Sandler, Jennifer Garner, Judy Greer, Ansel Elgort, J.K. Simmons, and Dennis Haysbert (who will always be President David Palmer from 24 to me). I found Adam Sandler's role in this movie to be unexpected but I was very pleasantly surprised by his acting, and he ended up being one of my favorite parts of the movie. However, the characters that stole the show for me were those of two teenagers, Tim Mooney (Elgort), whose mother has abandoned him and his father for a new man and life in California, and Brandy Beltmeyer (Kaitlyn Dever), whose overprotective mother is smothering and suffocating her. I've enjoyed the recent movies I've seen with Elgort and think he has some great talent, and this movie only reinforced those thoughts for me. I've only seen Dever in a small role on Bad Teacher, but I also thought she was great and look forward to seeing her in a bigger role in the future.

Summing it up, I liked the movie, despite the fact that it was a bit of a downer. It did try to tackle a lot of characters and plots, however, which is perhaps what led me to feel like some items were left unresolved. At times I felt like the movie was trying to do too much. 3 stars for me.",1413590400,,2574,4.574837310195227
6650652,4,B00NGL7JK4,"""Men, Women & Children"" (2014 release; 119 min.) brings the interwoven stories of a Texas community near Austin living in today's social media frenzy, and the correlating emptiness. As the movie opens, the narrator (Emma Thompson) informs us we are seeing the spacecraft Voyager, launched in 1977, reach the outer limits of our solar system, and as it leaves for unchartered territories, Voyager makes one last photograph of earth, a mere ""pale blue dot"". We are then introduced to the ensemble cast: Helen and Don (played by Rosemary DeWitt and Adam Sandler) are unhappily married and before long, they are having affairs. Patricia (played by Jennifer Garner) has a tight, if not suffocating, control of how her daughter Brandy (played by Kaitlyn Dever) uses her smartphone and computer. Don (plated by) is struggling to adjust to life after his wife left him and their son Tim (played by Ansel Elgort). Meanwhile, Tim, a star football player, has quit the football team, much to the despair of the glory-seeking school admin and also his dad. And on and on. There are at least 5 or 6 other main characters but to tell you might spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: ""Men, Women & Children"" is directed and co-written by Jason Reitman, he of ""Juno"", ""Thank You for Smoking"", and ""Up In the Air"", just to name those. Even though the story line is very different from ""Up In the Air"", there certainly are parallels in the themes: loneliness, despair, and the need for kindness. While the adults certainly fall short on many levels, I couldn't help but feel for the high school kids, assuming that what is portrayed in the film bears resemblance to reality. It's all about the ""hook-up"" culture, and status. And why would you talk when you can text the person standing 5 ft. away from you? Given the all-star ensemble cast, there are many choice performances, including Jennifer Garner as the unlikeable and suffocating mom, but I also liked Judy Greer's performance (as another one of the moms). Also note that there is a delightful soundtrack for this movie, with among others a fantastic cover of Donna Summer's ""I Feel Love"", dramatically slowed down by Nick Hallett and Ray Sweeten. The movie's last 15-20 minutes are fantastic, and when Emma Thompson's voice-over concludes the movie with reading from Carl Sagan's ""Pale Blue Dot"" book as we see Voyager continue on its never-ending journey, it feels just right.

""Men, Women & Children"" has not gotten good reviews, generally speaking, The movie opened on a couple of screens this weekend here in Cincinnati, and I went to see it with low expectations. Because of the large cast, it took me a while to familiarize myself with all of the characters, but once that was done, I thought the movie was far better than what I had been led to believe. The matinee screening where I saw this at today was poorly attended, but this does not surprise me as this is not a 'feel good' movie like ""Juno"" or in a way even ""Up In the Air"" was. If you have a chance to see ""Men, Women & Children"", be it in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, I'd suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",1413590400,,3210,4.709964412811388
6650673,4,B00NGL7JK4,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related to a lot of these characters, but probably mostly to Ansel's (despite him being much younger than me, haha) due to his ""doomed relationship"".  Anyway, not a perfect movie and certainly not for everyone, so I can kinda understand the low ratings (I give it a 4 out of 5), and I like director Jason Reitman's film Up in the Air better (my fave by him), and I'm not sure I agree with some reviews saying social media is separating us from each other (can be a great way for shy, awkward, introverted, etc people to connect), but this may be his most human film.  Definitely about people longing and searching for connection and as I said that's right up my alley.  So this is the one I decided to review :)

Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,,1796,4.5092592592592595

6650675,3,B00NGL7JK4,"Classic first world problems put to great cinematic use.  If you like pointing your fingers at people of poor moral character you'll like this movie.  It accurately depicts how easy it is for a wife to cheat.. and how much worse the husband has at it .. which is kinda funny, since it's the husband who usually really wants to cheat.  Then there's the creepy mom doing anything to live thru her daughter for fame... and yeah that'll gross you out too.  Then there's the poor milliennial that wilts pretty easily over some of the most soap opera esque antics over a girlfriend and basically tries to kill himself because... his just too white and handsome to deal with this tough life.

6650677,2,B00NGL7JK4,"The film is done by the same people who did Juno and Up in the Air, and this film is noting like either of those quality dark comedies.  This movie is just depressing and downright creepy in parts.  It has no discernable message other than everyone lies and cheats and has lewd sex.  The pornography was so offensive that it significantly overshadowed the quality of the acting of the major characters, and the excellent acting of Jennifer Garner, Adam Sandler, and others is the only reason I gave this movie two stars.  Overall, at the end of the film, I was left with disappointment and the regret that I can't get that hour and a half back.  Skip this movie!",1489017600,,662,4.483333333333333

6650680,5,B00NGL7JK4,I loved this movie. There is a thin line between taking care of your child and causing harm.,1487462400,,92,4.166666666666667
6650681,5,B00NGL7JK4,"As an ensemble film, we are told many different stories that happen at the same time, but they all revolve around society's changing with today's internet. It shows us just how less interested we have become of most reality, and how we're constantly dependent on our phones and tablets. The film dives into the themes of loneliness, depression, isolation, puberty, profanity, shame, adultery, over-protective restriction, and even suicide. These themes are perfectly represented in almost all of these stories, and every single one of the cast members do a fantastic job of portraying them.

If I had to choose one story that stuck out with me the most, it would have to be the romance between Kaitlyn Dever and Ansel Elgort. What really cements it in, is that they are parallels of one another, as they both have mothers who never understood them, and they have their own online worlds they exist in to get away from all the crap that is surrounding their lives. And when their worlds are taken from them, they either find true happiness within each other, or feel like there's no where else to turn. The ending of this left me in tears, as it was just one heartbreaking moment after the next. As someone who has been suffering from depression and feeling suicidal, I relate a lot to this. I know how it feels to be treated unfairly or told that your longtime passions or hobbies aren't what others want. To me, this is the role that I think truly defines Elgort's talents as an actor.

As for any runner ups tales, it would have to be with Elena Kampouris and Will Peltz, giving us a depiction on how far people will go just to get noticed or not made a complete joke out of, and what the consequences will be when going too far. While not much can be said about Will Peltz, the main highlight here is Elena Kampouris. I feel like this film should be shown to all those girls forcefully starving themselves. You know what I mean, those girls who think they're fat but they really aren't.

I have to also give props to the story involving Adam Sandler and Rosemarie DeWitt. Not only does this showcase lost desires, years after marriage, but it also turns cliches on their sides, in ways you don't expect them to. And DeWitt and Sandler both give excellent performances to back it all up. I still hold the fact that I'm an Adam Sandler fan, but I do agree with people that he does manage to do better with dramatic work.

Men, Women, and Children is a film I'm glad I got to see. Performances aside, the writing and direction are flawless, and Jason Reitman has truly cemented himself as one of the best working director's in Hollywood. And as far as I'm concerned, this is his best film.",1487030400,,2689,4.538144329896907

Quite surprising also, is with just a few words, certain individuals, have the power to make someone wish to take their own life.

6650997,5,B00NGL7JK4,"To be clear, I rated this as five stars, not because I loved it or even liked it.  Reitman's film is a commentary on the breathtaking change in relationships, every variety and on all levels since the dawn of our urgent need for constant  and instant connection via wifi and our device of choice.  As a mom of two daughters, it was difficult to watch, My girls are 12 years apart.  Same dad, same hometown, my firstborn and her younger sister , however, could not have different experiences, largely due to this new normal: our obsession with tech.  The film underscores how Carl Sagan has achieved the desired effect.  The supposition of Sagan's flimsy pseudo science theory of the ""Pale Blue Dot"" has done what no dictator or grassroots political movement could.  This film couples Sagan's belief in humanity's lack of uniqueness, purpose or reason for existence with the dividing of life before and after 9/11.  It was this new day of infamy, 9/11 which traumatized the nation in ways we are still learning. Teens, married couples, everyone trying to connect (and remain so) have been hugely effected and blind-sided by the implications of our brave new world, in which we gladly hand over our cash and our privacy to have our phones on us or our computers in front of us at all times.  We know the dangers, the freedoms we are gambling away, but we do it anyway... But more valuable than our money or freedom is the loss of relationships with each other, with our children.  It is all uncharted territory, and we are making a mess of it.  The movie reviewing professionals have dissed and dismissed this film for poor writing, and the usual movie-making flaws.  Writing this, as a mother who held my newborn daughter as I watched the twin towers fall in realtime, I can say that this film does indeed capture the momentous change we have witnessed and experienced together in the years that have followed since that awful day.  As for keeping us safer or facilitating deeper connection, this new form of communicating has served to deliver the opposite:  we are further distanced into our own worlds.  For teens, trying to understand themselves, each other and navigating basic relationships, texting has taught them to dispense with conventional face to face contact.  The mood of the film is insecure, dark and pretty hopeless.  Sadly, I believe the film captured the activities and actual mood of American society quite accurately.

(As the parents to their kids) Even though I believe that the message of this movie was addressing the issues of today's families; technology allows us to reach out, lash, share extensions of ourselves, but also a means to satisfy our own individual wants. I do think technology (social media) has really allowed more deteriation of the relationships between people today more than ever. But the issues in this film have been around longer than the technology that makes it easier to talk to each other online. Overall I think it adds a good outlook and angle on today's modern life. Also that Carl Sagan video, ""Pale Blue Dot,"" does make you think more about everything as a whole. We are all lonely creatures that desire to be loved and love. Just my two cents.

6651521,4,B00NGL7JK4,"Sad movie, touches on reality with a little more drama than necessary?

 I don't know, I was surprised as the way people relate to one another in this film.  Is Life really like this???  Where children are so far removed from parental Guidance?  And think independently, on their own; lost in direction and lacking in morality?  There is no sense of Spirituality left in their lives?  Well...when the young boy  mentioned Carl Sagan...I was beginning to think THAT is where this Film is then leading - that we are Lost In Space with no real direction.  That no one really cares for any one - and this seems to be where I saw the Sadness in this film.  WE all cling to one another...in some glimmer that there might be  Something Better left?  There may be some sense of belonging?  And yet, no one person had the answer - outside of..."" What You want in Your Eggs?""  Perhaps, by all appearances... We are a World Lost IN Space?  (I know better that it isn't)...but that seems to be the message.

So what this Film then prortrays...IS  That THIS is where people are these day ... Nothingness.?  We live, and die - with no real hope for every seeing any real future ahead of us.  Death is the Final outcome - and what you do between your birth until the end - could BE either Fruitless - or maybe - have some purpose.  Which even the Purpose a person may pursue...could be fruitless anyway, there are no guarantees, so why Bother?

IF this is how the World has ended up - then, IT is sad.  And for that reason, perhaps God can not Help THEM.  Because I DO Know that there IS a GOD.  And HE does care for every person on this planet.  IT'S the People who have given up on HIM  They have stopped searching and reading HIS WORD - and This Film is then a perfect depiction of what IT IS Like to be Godless in their life.",1471305600,,1814,4.261764705882353

If you are the parent of a teen or preteen, then this movie is probably not for you.

If you are in the perfect  marriage and every day is sweeter than the next, then this movie is definitely not for you.

If pornography offends you...run, don't walk...away from this movie.

This movie deals with some of the more raw aspects of modern day life in America. It's in-your-face and sugarcoats nothing. For me, I find that to be delightfully refreshing. I suspect most people will find themselves depressed after watching it.

6652203,5,B00NGL7JK4,"In a world of avoided uncomfortable truths, this movie takes a dive into the deep intricacies of modern, human relations. A film that could have been derailed by aiming at stereotypes, this journey is one of familiarity... either by way of personal experience or experience not too far removed from one's own pillow.

For two hours, I found myself on a journey that was terribly horrific to watch, but refreshingly honest. I was torn constantly between the desire to turn off the movie and the need to continue forth. I also spent a great deal of the last act questioning whether the damage of our technological age can be reversed without following in the footsteps of Garner's wonderfully portrayed and well-meaning character.

There was no part of this movie that wasn't well done.  The writing, the acting, the cinematography... all amazing. Unfortunately, it all works together to create a gut-wrenching film that conveys a much needed message in our generation.  It's the overwhelming honesty of this film that kept it from commercial success. Yet, the reality is that this film could change the lives of those that endure the journey. I would challenge anyone of mature and intelligent thinking to brave the viewing of this film.

Fair warning:  this film contains a plethora of adult themes, content, and language (cursing and otherwise).  This material has been handled with the highest degree of care, integrity, and gentleness, affordable to a film of such brutal realism. Please do not watch around children and avoid at all costs if you are easily nonplussed by adult or sexual material.",1457308800,8,1600,5.0150943396226415

1. The benefit of teaching evolution...when the young football star quits and ask whats the point of it all..
2. It shows how women who divorce their husband destroys a family by hurting the relationship bond that children have with their parents. All the time in hollywood movies its the guys who cheat for some young woman but you very rarely see a movie where the woman is cheating on the guy or how about radio songs where the guys are singing about the women being his everything and joy but when a woman sings about a guy its usually because she going to get revenge from his cheating or she can survive without the guy.
3.  It shows how twisted our sexuality has become with the interent from porn and Ashley Madison encouraging cheating.
Just a rare hollywood movie that gives a rare glimpse of real life.  Another great movie is Chris Rocks I Think I love my wife.  Which talks about a wife sexually starves her husband who then is later targeted by a homewrecker.

I would not go to the extreme that Jennifer Garner did with her daughter, but in our society how else do we keep 13 and 14 year old girls from getting pregnant or contracting STD's. I found it very sad as a mother of a 5 year old because I already fear the sexual pressures she will face....probably at 11 or 12 by the time she is older.",1451433600,,691,4.242424242424242
6652811,5,B00NGL7JK4,"I don't understand why this movie is at 31% on Rotten Tomatoes.  I can only assume it's because the critics approached it as being some kind of scathing critique of web technology and thus found it superficial, but I really don't think that's what this movie is trying to do.  It's simply an interweaving contemporary melodrama with a heavy technology element--and a really well done one at that.  The performances are believable and honest, the writing is full of memorable one-liners and scenes, and the production values are top notch.  The central romance between Kaitlyn Dever and Ansel Elgort is way more romantic than any John Green novel adaptation.

My only criticism would be that because the movie has to move so quickly through so many interweaving storylines, nuance is often the first thing to go.  For example, Jennifer Garner's character is and remains ridiculously uptight for the entire movie up until the last scene.  I wanted to know more about why she is the way she is, but because the packed storyline doesn't really allow for for much exploration, we never really know, and thus her final reversal seems rather arbitrary.  The other storylines suffer similarly, but this is a minor critique.  With so many movies coming out that rely so heavily on nostalgia--reboots, remakes, etc--it's so refreshing to see a movie that embraces newness and at least attempts to engage the contemporary world.  That takes guts these days in this risk-averse environment, so I'll add an extra star to my four star review for guts!",1451433600,4,1537,4.945525291828794

I liked this movie.  I found it enjoyable to watch and the variety of characters engaging as they seemed realistic, at least from the perspective of someone living in the Pacific NW corner of the US (we do pride ourselves on being a little weird).  There are no obviously evil characters, nor any saints, just a bunch of basically good people with flaws of different sorts, depending on your POV.  Heat warming with a bit of sadness.

6653446,4,B00NGL7JK4,"I do not watch interpersonal relationship dramas as a rule. We treat others poorly enough as it is without intentionally watching films that give us pointers on new and creative ways to betray our loved one's trust.
That said, I did like this film. I know what you're thinking: ""She must have a head injury if she's enjoying Adam Sandler as the dramatic lead.""
And that is a legitimate concern. To the best of my knowledge, my grey matter is quite intact.
The film addresses the  complicated network of relationships that an American (or any human) has to navigate on any given day. This is the core plot of most dramatic films. Men, Women and Children fully incorporates the ever-increasing technological complexities that have become an integral part of everyday life. What is your teenager texting on their phone and to whom, or browsing on the Internet? Or your husband, wife, or lover?

There are certain subjects that are not discussed. Ever. There are places even TV shows like sex and the city did not go.  This movie went to every single humiliating and private personal place everybody may or may not have in these days of modern technology. And for no apparent reason. It is not funny, it is not amusing,  it has no moral, it draws no conclusions, it is extremely negative and supports the idea that marriage is a totally worthless institution these days, it does not serve the same function as pornography, it is just painful to watch. They should never have made this movie.  I am agog that anybody would finance this script in the first place. This movie left me with the sick feeling that modern technology has made human existence even more unbearable and it,  modern technology, has become abusive to people socially, sexually, financially, morally, and spiritually than it has ever been before in history.  In addition to being just extraordinarily embarrassing and painful to watch, it's also tells stories that are very very depressing and pathetic and sad.  We don't need films to show us how awful things have become. Every adult already realizes how awful things have become. We just don't discuss it. Normally I am against censorship of any kind, but it would be a great boon to mankind as a whole if someone would gather together every copy of this film that exists and destroyed it.",1444176000,,1583,4.7101449275362315

I think people and families who are immersed in the technology age should see this. It gives you perspective on how society communicates today, how innocence is now lost and how much the things we once valued has been affected by our constant obsession with social media and the whole digital world. It conveys this while showing the extreme dynamics of different families and adolescents, particularly how those relationships develop and have to navigate life in such a virtual-instant-driven time period.

The Acting is solid, the stories have both originality and believability. The point it brings home through the several stories and characters is that the internet is not the problem with our societal maladies. The internet didn't make the married couple look outside their marriage for what they were unable to give each other. It wasn't the reason a mother sought to,live out her fantasies through her daughter, or why a teenage athlete felt despondent and found relief in a video game.  These are people who have problems that have nothing to do with the technology of the internet, but its that same technology that is used by them to seek out their own personal needs its a tool, not unlike any other tool, but considerably more sophisticated. Its what these characters did with  this tool that this movie is about. Its real, its at times gut wrenching when you see the desperation and the futility of people in situations of their own making. Nothing is resolved in this movies. Things are only brought to a head, leaving you the viewer to determine what the future holds for these interesting people  Watch it and then youndecide",1444176000,2,1246,4.706422018348624

6654638,4,B00NGL7JK4,"I am of retirement age and I have taught high school for over 40 years.  The reason I mention this is because when I saw the trailer for this I was blow away with the images.  The use of the texting caught my attention and I must confess when I saw Adam Sandler I was curious as to how good he would be in this type of movie. Well the bottom line is that this movie disappeared and it never came to my theatres, so I forgot about it. Then while shopping a Wal Mart I passed by those bins with the $5  movies.  You know the ones that are so old kids won't look at them or they are direct to DVD and bad.  To kill time I shuffled through them and this came up.

I just finished it and I now understand why it faded away. The movie is well made and has many quality actors and has a strong script, all of which should have equaled to a great movie. But....... I laugh out loud in spots, shook my head in others, and groaned in a few.  I knew these kids andI had known about the texting and  ""hookin"" up from days as a teacher. I had met and dealt with mothers like these here, but what took me  by surprise was the adults. Some of these were co workers ,friends, and I am ashamed to say me to an extent.

The subject of sex and belonging is a part, a major part of every man, woman, and child [ just like the title]. I believe the movie faded away quickly because it was too uncomfortable for us to watch. Movies are to take us places we have never been. Show us things we have never seen and make  us think about things we would never have thought about. These are fundamental things movies should do. However when the mirror shows us our deepest flaws we have the tendency to run away from it or deny it.  This movie made me look at myself and others in a way that made me shutter and feel sick.

So should I recommend this movie or not?  Well not really.  This movie is one you the reader/viewer have to make on your own.  I would offer this though I would watch it by myself and not with my wife or girl friend.",1443312000,,2012,3.9676616915422884

If there wasn't the foul language or crudity (which, sad to say, is a reality of the way people and life is today) I'd say it would be a great film to show in a classroom. HOWEVER (I add that before people blast me by saying how could I ever suggest that), that is why I said without the foul and vulgar language and sex. If those were removed however, the movie would have nothing. There is a point to it, of how disengaged we have all become from one another by using the internet, chat rooms, texting, websites, online dating, etc, to fill in the gaps of real relationships and communication.

That being said, my husband and I took a chance and enjoyed it. Lots of talking points, so we pressed pause a lot to discuss what we were seeing play out. It actually was a great date movie just for that reason! It is heartbreaking. The ending, just as heartbreaking; because there is NO ending. No clean ties. No story winding down to ""happily ever after"". It just- ends. I suppose that is life at it's best, though. The open ending leaves room for lots of interpretation. From a psychological standpoint, there are a lot of broken people that had issues that should have been tackled-and weren't. We did not finish the movie thinking that we were to suppose these people had ""normal"" problems and were okay. We got a view into the ugliness of ourselves, and it caused us to spend time evaluating our own relationships and parenting.

Ectopic pregnancy, eating disorder, pornography/sex addiction, affairs, social media and how it affects modern families, I mean that's like not even close to the entire list of junk he threw into the weird stew that is this movie.

Kinda like the ephemeral nature of the 'connections' facilitated by modern day convenience that the film was exploring - intentional? The actors seemed like imitations of roles they've already played: Rosemarie DeWitt as the promiscuous, bored housewife; Jennifer Garner in, what was essentially, a reprisal of her role from another one of Reitman's flicks, Juno; same for Academy Award winner, JK Simmons, as the downtrodden father of a daughter in over her head. The only one that seemed to be stretching himself was Adam Sandler, but his schluppy shtick was equal parts odd-casting and too familiar.

6654868,3,B00NGL7JK4,"Another film that provides the viewer an insight on how the internet has affected people's lives particularly friendships and romantic relationships and its effects with many aspect of their lives is Men,Women & Children. It stars an ensemble cast that includes Rosemarie DeWitt,Jennifer Garner,Judy Greer,Dean Norris,Adam Sandler,Ansel Elgort and Kaitlyn Dever. This film directed by Jason Reitman provides us a view on how these so-called online relationship have affected people in general from men,women and teenagers.

The screenplay follows the story of high school teenagers and their parents with regards to how they use the internet with respect to their relationships with other people and how it has affected them as well and society in general. We get to see them how they doing numerous things online like communication through chatting,forming friendships and relationships through the use of social media,deal with life issues using internet websites,use the internet for careers like modeling and acting; and a source of illicit materials like pornography. We get to see the social change that has happened as well as how it affects people's lives when using the personal computer,PC tablets and cell phones.

While I credit Jason Reitman for trying to make a good film about the internet,I felt that his approach on the subject matter has become hollow particularly the attitude of people towards it. A lot of the characters apparently use the internet to meet someone to sleep with and a great source of illicit materials made the film somewhat overbearing as the other activities people do online were somewhat put in the background. Sex has become the main theme for many of the characters in the story. In addition to that,the screenplay should have minimized the impact of Patricia Beltmeyer (Jennifer Garner's role) for this is someone who probably existed during the first few years of the internet and not after the technology's existence for more than 20 years now. In short,the a lot of issues that Reitman tried to deal about the internet have become obsolete as if we are at a time when the technology is still in its infancy instead of being an integral part of our life. A better film that would probably deal with the subject is Disconnect.",1435881600,,2272,5.104838709677419

6654909,4,B00NGL7JK4,"Possible spoilers.  This well-cast film by Jason Reitman tells the story of how the internet and social media in particular, has changed the routines of millions of Americans.  The large cast depict individual stories in a Texas suburb (shot in Austin) that loosely have a connection.  Adam Sandler, in a rare straight dramatic role (he's fine if constantly sour-faced) plays Don, whose marriage to Helen (Rosemarie DeWitt) has devolved to the point where sex is a scheduled appointment.  He makes up for it with on-line porn.  In an early scene, his computer is so full of pop-up ads and other malware, it won't even function.  So he goes into his 15 year old son Chris's (Travis Tope) room to use his computer and finds that the boy has an even better selection of porn sites.  While this satisfies both males at the time, it causes problems later in the film, especially for Chris.

Judy Greer plays Donna, a single mom who is promoting her teen daughter, Hannah (Olivia Crocicchia) who is in line to get a small acting role in a movie.  She set up a web site for the hopeful model/actress and posted several suggestive photos.  No nudity but risqu, none the less.  Kent Mooney (Dean Norris) and his teen son, Tim (Ansel Elgort) are dealing with their wife and mother abandoning them for another man who lives in California.  She has essentially cut ties with both.  Tim, a star on the football team quits to focus on his on-line video games.  Finally, there is the Beltmeyers (Jennifer Garner, Jason Douglas and Kaitlyn Dever).  Patricia (Garner) is one of those moms who monitors everything on Brandy's (Dever) phone and computer.  It is, in fact, her full time job!  She has an assortment of software and tracking devices she uses to determine Brandy's whereabouts, what she's doing and who she's talking to.  She's even made it known to Brandy as to what she's doing.  Protecting her daughter of course.

It is clear that we are seeing some extremes as to the use of social media.  One mother encourages the use, even posting pictures of her daughter in her underwear.  Another restricts use tighter than North Korea.  A boy gives up active sports for virtual games.  Another boy when faced with his first real sexual encounter, can't get it up.  And then there are the Truby's whose sexual troubles are so great they seek trysts through the web.  Does it all work?  Well, sometimes.

The best scenes are between Tim and Brandy who meet cute in the school cafeteria.  Both Elgort and Devers (so good on TV's ""Justified"") are promising actors and convey the angst of teens coming of age with emotion and conviction.  The film is hardly uplifting and at times confounding and the connection between the families appears a bit of a stretch.  There is also a confusing overriding theme regarding Earth's place in the Universe.  Narration by Emma Thompson pops up once and a while, as well as a reading in class that makes reference to Carl Sagan's book and the photo from space called Pale Blue Dot.  We see the NASA photo and a simulation of Voyager 1 flying through space at the beginning and end of the film.  This isn't a great movie, but I did think it had relevance in our modern world.

The Blu ray transfer features 1080p encoding and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  It is well done as are most major Blu ray features these days.  Colors are excellent, black levels are fine and detail is well defined.  I could see no artifacts or problems whatsoever.  A first rate transfer.  Audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  The content of the film isn't demanding and is mostly dialog.  So what I'm looking for is primarily a clear delivery, usually through the center channel.  The disc delivers.  A few scenes include some ambient sounds from the rear but that's about it.  There are English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and French subtitles.  Extras include some deleted scenes and a couple featurettes (Virtual Intimacy: 13:29 and Seamless Interface: 8:29).",1427673600,,3964,4.7379209370424595

6654918,5,B00NGL7JK4,"I had been wanting to see this film since I first saw the trailer and I am really glad I was finally able to. I watch many films (both mainstream and independent) as an avid Netflix viewer, and fine art student in film courses, so it takes a lot for a film to truly speak to me (as snotty as that may sound.) A lot of films today are carbon copies of each other with slight tweaks to separate them. This was the first film in ages to genuinely anger, sadden, pull at my heart strings so to speak. I think that the film is relatable in at least some sense to any viewer- honing in on topics like teen pregnancy, eating disorders, stunted relationships in the age of social media and easily accessible red tube, and also the effect porn is having on teenagers and their first sexual experience (looking at the male and the female point of view as well-- which I really appreciated.) The only thing that I think actually took away from the film was that it was almost 'too pretty'. They say cinematography can either add to, or hinder a film (even when it is super technically sound and aesthetically pleasing) but i think that the matter that this film dealt with was too real and gritty to have a perfect, glazed over visuals. You also really need to be careful not to glamourize things like eating disorders. I'm not sure.. I could be wrong.. but coming from a female artist's point of view, that's all I have to say about that. Overall, I was really glad to see actors taken out of their typical type cast roles (mainly the adult comedy actors) and do a fantastic job and not give a hint of goofiness, but rather, play a very convincing average, middle class modern day American in any old town. And the fact that the younger actors were given a chance to show their abilities was very valuable as well.",1426723200,,1804,4.372023809523809

Reitman gives it a decent effort and honestly there were many flat moments in the film. I would have given this two stars were it not for the two young leads Ansel Elgort and Kaitlyn Dever and their storyline.  I also thought Dean Norris did very well as Elgort's father who was recently deserted by an unfaithful spouse. It is worth watching for these three.  Everyone else gives a fine enough performance, but I do not care much for their characters.  Reitman tells each one in a heavy-handed style layering cliche after cliche. I think focusing on a smaller set of storylines would have given the director opportunity for more character development and a tighter script might have prevented this film from derailing so badly.  Nevertheless, it is worth watching for the above mentioned actors and the subject matter, which is very timely and should be something we think about.",1423267200,,1034,4.8522727272727275

Characters IM, txt, game, and surf their way through life in this movie that is simultaneously about kids, adult relationships, families, and what could be called regular stressors. Each character in this film is thrown for a loop in one way or another, and yet they (largely) recover. There's some true love, true betrayal, and everything in between.

For Adam Sandler fans, it's cool to see him playing a serious character in this one -- and doing it so well. Many other great actors are in this movie, including Dean Norris who plays Hank (Hank!) in Breaking Bad. Good old Hank does a great job here.

It addresses real issues we all face because of the Internet's integration into our lives.  But it never blames the Internet for anything.  It demonstrates humanity's tendencies THROUGH its use and abuse of the Internet.  Fascinating and sad.  Creepy and liberating.  We live, love, destroy, abuse, and explore on the Internet.

Pornography, cheating, bullying, gaming, friendships, learning, absorbing other philosophies via Youtube, posting too much, posting too little, posting as others, using the Internet to display a different side of yourself--it's all here in graphic detail.  All the effects of using the Internet, misunderstanding the Internet, and fearing the Internet.

Slowly paced, but never boring.  You will see quite a few real-life situations, tragedies, etc. mirrored in this movie.

With perfect performances and tight writing that draw you in before you realize what's happening; Men, Women, & Children will have an impact on you.  Like all good art.

I say that because I see a lot of the negative reviews on here and I think the problem is many of these people are not into this type of movie. This is a complex film, but it stays on topic. the point of this movie is what is and isn't too much. All of the characters, the parental characters, are trying to navigate in a world that is different and in some cases vastly different from the one that they are used to. Each of them fails and their own special way, but no one is a villain in this  piece.
I think this movie is very good, but there are a lot of characters and there is very little in the way of thru line. I for instance feel that one of the story lines kind of peters out. It is an extremely important one so it doesn't really take from the movie, but the part of me that feels like why is this even in the movie. I don't want to give spoilers so I'm not going to say what it is but that is where I think there is room for improvement and that is why I can't give it 5 stars.",1420675200,4,1081,3.825892857142857

6655004,4,B00NGL7JK4,"Sandler is one of the richest stars in the business, playing the same lovable character in the very successful formula movies he produces.  But he is also a very good dramatic actor.  I liked the risk he took in the Judd Apatow film, ""Funny People"", and did an excellent job playing a VERY UNLOVEABLE stand-up comic.

I also like Jennifer Garner, and think she has an eye for good scripts. So when I saw the two of them were in the film, I was optimistic.

I like narration if it is done well, and Emma Thompson is a great narrator.  Will Farrell did a film, ""Stanger than Fiction"" that was similar stylistically, with Thompson as one of the leads, and the narrator, and the same clever use of graphics.

I'm not sure that really worked with this film, however.  It was very effective in the other film, because it was a fantasy love story, but it seemed a bit odd with the heavy subject matter of a solidly dramatic film.

I thought the script and the acting were good, and it held my interest. What I thought was so important about this film, was the way it also informed the audience of so many real dangers technology creates, and a disturbing, real life look at what goes on with teenagers, with, and without the use of technology.

I think Sandler and his son, both being significantly harmed by the accessibility of internet porn, is probably extremely common in real life.  It is scary to see how a teenager, having access to explicit internet porn since childhood, where he could even skype with a real prostitute, could be left a sexual cripple, unable to function in a real life relationship.

And the temptation to use internet porn, when adult relationships are troubled, is deadly.

It showed a couple who love each other, but not able to deal with boredom, both playing with fire, using the internet to actually meet up with sexual partners.

You also see a loving, single mother, trying to relive her own failed attempt at stardom, being seduced by easy money, and basically, prostituting her daughter.

And when an older male athlete compliments a younger anorexic girl on the skeletal figure dieting over the summer achieved, she allows him to have what she know's will be a sexual encounter so brief, it passes unnoticed by her two companions as a bathroom break.  This is not dramatized, it is REAL and happens every day.",1420329600,,2341,4.607228915662651

Makes you ponder how well we are managing our own relationships, but as real life dictates, there's no easy or straight answer sometimes.

6655065,3,B00NGL7JK4,"Alright, this movie is a bit of a mess, with way too many characters and storylines, and some uncertainty about whether it wants to be a witty drama or a campy ""dramady.""  It aspires to be the American Beauty (1999) of our age, giving us a poignant and profound snapshot of middle class white Americana the way that movie did at the turn of the millennium.  Unfortunately it comes up way short.  That director Jason Reitman had this earlier film in mind is evident from the comment he left on the Amazon page for the book by the same title on which this movie is based (an extremely graphic sexual work which makes this movie appear tame by comparison) in which he compared the book to American Beauty and The Graduate.  The main problem is too many characters.  Cheerleader Hannah Clint is a wannabe Hollywood starlet who seems too pre-fabricated (as portrayed by Olivia Crocicchia) to be believable as a stage mom's teen daughter.  Another anorectic cheerleader character could also be eliminated.  And so on.  Books don't translate well into movies unless you streamline the storyline and jettison the non-essential characters.  Perhaps Robert Altman could juggle 24 characters in his movie Nashville (1975), but success with this style of film is the exception to the rule and such complicated scripts are usually just too problematic.

That being said this the movie has some surprisingly good performances by Adam Sandler, Dean Norris, and Ansel Elgort, and a very disappointing one by Jennifer Garner.  Garner's character is so extreme it would have been better suited to a broad comedy, and no actress has been so poorly served by a director since Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest.  It is the director's job to not let actors embarrass themselves but Reitman clearly failed Garner here.

The movie is nicely filmed and scored, and quite beautiful and haunting in parts, not unlike American Beauty. It's just inundated by so many extraneous characters, overly obvious and somewhat dated messages, and it's own desire to be profound (five separate references to Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot - twice by one of the characters and three times by the narrator - just so we don't miss it) that the few good performances and poignant themes get obscured in the clutter.  This movie could have been less preachy about online addictions and the anonymity that breeds cruelty and instead focus in on it's more subtle theme of alienation and emptiness in the digital age.  The one ideal relationship in the movie is between two of the teens, Brandy and Tim, played by Kaitlyn Dever and Ansel Elgort, who establish their bond based on human contact and affection  (two things you can't get from a website, app, or online game).

I give this ambitious film three stars for what it gets right, but it's nowhere near the film it aspires to be.",1419120000,11,2831,4.840248962655601

6655067,5,B00NGL7JK4,"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a performance from Adam Sandler. That is, aside from his role in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" a full twelve years ago. He's an actor that's always had a certain potential that seemed to be wasted on the pointless, raunchy comedies he's churned out for the past few decades.

But, hopefully his emotional performance in ""Men, Women & Children"" serves as a precursor to more interesting work to come. Despite its flaws, this is one of the most timely and deeply affecting pieces of work I've seen in a long time.

It's a movie that tries to tackle many subjects, all under the bubble of technology. At the forefront, we see Sandler's character struggling with his marriage and trying to work out some of his various problems. There's also several other intertwining stories, some that deal with infidelity and young love, and others that handle issues with self-image and peer pressure. They're not all equal in quality (that being expected), but each one certainly has something to say.

The most well-developed segment includes Ansel Elgort (who you may know from ""The Fault in Our Stars""), playing a teen struggling with having just quit his high-school football team. We see him concerned over the meaning of life and this is only alleviated as he gets to know a girl named Brandy. Their relationship in the film is beautiful - and so is most of the movie - with a few exceptions here and there. It's a film that starts off a bit rocky and doesn't really find its footing until the first thirty minutes have past. But once it does, it proves to be shockingly true and current. These are issues that people are dealing with on a daily basis, and it handles them in a touching and true manner that can't be rivaled by the majority of mainstream movies out today.",1419033600,47,1793,4.667721518987341

If there are children in your life that you love, pay the $4 and get the messages this film was intended to give.  It's not a blockbuster, a grammy winner, or even likely to make it in any one person's top 100 all time favorite movie lists - it's a portrait of extremes meant to blatantly remind of you how increasingly complicated life becomes with forever evolving technology taking center stage.",1418860800,,605,4.4324324324324325
6655071,4,B00NGL7JK4,"Men, Women & Children, the sixth feature by writer and director Jason Reitman (Juno, Up in the Air), does not deserve the severe critical lambasting it has received.  Set in a Texas suburb, the film depicts how various people's lives, loves, and day-to-day experiences are facilitated, shaped, or stunted by the Internet and the technology in their lives.  Or, put another way, it is an Internet-age reflection on such enduring concerns and rites as coming-of-age, infidelity, and parental responsibility.  Rosemarie DeWitt and Adam Sandler portray a bored couple both considering extramarital experimentation.  Judy Greer is a mother who tried and failed to become a star in California and now condones and encourages her teenage daughter's oversexed exhibitionism and voracious desire for fame.  Jennifer Garner co-stars as another mother, one almost driven mad by her fixation with monitoring and policing her put-upon daughter's computer and phone.  Other stories touch on pornography, high-school peer pressure manifested online, and the way people, enabled by their digital devices, can be alone together.

Now and then, I admit, Reitman reaches an inch too far or lapses into modestly ponderous pretense.  For example, the slice-of-life Texas stories are blended with shots of the Voyager 1 spacecraft floating in interstellar space in a too-cute bid to contrast relatively microscopic human experiences with the ambivalent grandeur of the cosmos, and the sheer volume of tech-centric conversations and crises threatens to resemble a wag of the self-righteous finger a few times.  Yet there is so much of enormous quality here, from moments of genuine insight (and painful recognition) to a veritable catalog of strong performances, including by the very natural teenage actors.  The various poignant subplots, a few laced with relaxed humor, drew me in.  This is perhaps the highest compliment I can pay this unduly maligned picture:  it is involving and satisfying.",1418601600,,1974,5.457236842105263
6655072,3,B00NGL7JK4,"Whats it about?

In modern-day Texas, three compromised families are fraught with lust, change and despair as they navigate the world found online and off.

What did I think?

In this soothingly intimate and captivating film, Reitman (the director of Juno and Up in the Air) pulls together various stories in a sincere bid to understand how technology is infused into our lives, by visually representing the characters text messages and computer desktops with great flair. His broad approach can sometimes become disaffecting, particularly with a motif involving an intergalactic satellite and narration by Emma Thompson, but his amazing cast of actors (which includes the likes of Adam Sandler, Jennifer Garner and Judy Greer) give highly engaging and nuanced performances. Its unabashedly dramatic, but also quite humorous and much more self-aware than many reviewers give it credit for.",1417478400,,889,5.427536231884058
6655073,5,B00NGL7JK4,"Jason Reitman has been responsible for some of the best portraits of modern life in America, made in the past ten years or so. His fearless character studies have tackled narcissism (Thank You for Smoking,) teen pregnancy (Juno,) crippling loneliness (Up in the Air,) and mental illness/alcoholism (Young Adult.) Men, Women & Children is Reitmans attempt at a modern-day remake of Ordinary People, rewritten for todays generation.

I almost skipped on this film in my local theaters too-short one week engagement of it, because critical reviews have panned it, which I certainly wasn't expecting, given Reitmans track record of timely and well-developed films. This is a time where I really think everybody missed the point. It wants to be an important film about how social media is dehumanizing us, and it succeeded, at least to me.

The film follows several semi-interconnected stories and characters and their sad, inconsequential little lives. They include a couple mutually uninterested in their own marriage, each leading separate affairs (Rosemarie DeWitt and Adam Sandler,) their porn-addicted son (Travis Tope,) a mother (Jennifer Garner) who tyrannically monitors every movement her outcast daughter (Kaitlyn Dever) makes, who falls hard for a similar outcast (Ansel Elgort) who is disgusted with his home life. A progressive parent (Judy Greer) created a website for her daughter, an aspiring actress (Olivia Crocicchia,) when she may be doing her daughter more harm than good. Domestic violence, eating disorders, teen suicide, mental and physical abuse, class struggle and social alienation are some of this films many conversation-starting themes.

So I was very worried about Adam Sandler in a legit movie. I tend to forget hes shown us he can do dramatic work, as evidenced in Punch Drunk Love. He gives a nuanced and very fine performance here, and doesnt detract at all from everything else going on. Ansel Elgort, of The Fault in Our Stars also does very nice work. Really, though, there isn't a bad performance across the board, which is saying a lot, considering this is a film of many younger up-and-comers.

A credit sequence that shows The Voyager Space Probe moving past planet after planet, emphasizing how unimportant Earth, and therefore all of us, are on a grand scale, but the film shows us that even though its become nearly impossible, one can make a human connection in a world that has become desensitized by technology.

And yes, Reitman is a little too heavy-handed with the films themes, a lot of them appearing more obvious than they should. And, yes, Men, Women & Children may not be telling us anything that we don't already know about the world, but you're likely to find more than one or two characters here who you will relate to. This is a film that desperately wants its viewer to lead a more meaningful life. Its a film that, with a few minor tweaks, could have been an Oscar contender, and would have been seen widely, as it should, rather than by a limited audience. Its a real downer, in truth, but it should inspire thought about how little you know about yourself and everyone around you.
