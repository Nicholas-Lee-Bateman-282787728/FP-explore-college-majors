THe only good thing about the movie was that the women were hot, that's it. Save your money and wait till the price goes down to like $2 or somthing before deciding to buy it, you are probably better of renting the movie but trust me, it's really not worth it, this was a huge dropoff from the first movie.",1204070400,,443,3.9887640449438204

If you enjoyed Viveca A. Fox in Two Can Play that Game, you'll love this sequel. Also starring good-looking Jason George, Kellita Smith, and Terri J. Vaughn, it's a cute movie with a cute plot.",1203206400,2,359,7.348837209302325
3049592,4,B0010NXURQ,"As I like to say, this movie is very entertaining. It is not as great as Rainforest Classics ""Stomp the Yard"", ""the Gospel"" or ""This Christmas"", but I only asked to be entertained when I sat down to watch this film. I was glad to see a film that cast the hilarious Tony Rock, Vivica A. Fox, Jason Winston George, and Jazsmin Lewis all in one film together. I am a fan of Fox, Rock and George although this proved to be a big role for George to carry at this point in his career. Especially under this director whom I must say is over his head with this job. By the way, his movie stands on its own independent of ""Two Can Play..."". If you want to get in the Rainforest spirit, get your hands on the aforementioned ""Stomp the Yard""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stomp-the-Yard-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JPK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stomp the Yard (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and ""The Gospel""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gospel-Special-Edition/dp/B000CBP02A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gospel (Special Edition)</a>.

But despite any shortcomings of the film not being a masterpiece of cinema, it was well worth price paid as an entertaining comedy that I enjoyed.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the film acting debut of Hot 107.9 Atlanta's Rashan Ali in the movie in a supporting role as one of Jazmin Lewis' character's best friends. Rashan has a bright spirit in the radio studio and as an Atlanta Hawks announcer and she does well in this movie. I'll be looking for her in upcoming projects.

Vivica does her regular ""thing"" in this movie with grand style and her fans will be pleased to see her go through the paces.

Another odd but pleasant surprise for me was the prominent placement of Upscale Magazine, one of my favorite magazines. I've been reading that magazine almost every month for many years and it was funny to see it on the big screen as almost a co-star of the movie. Big ups to the Affluent Lifestyle!

If you only buy one film every 2 years, this may not be the one for you. But if you like funny, entertaining movies and you like the work of any of the cast members featured, this movie is an easy choice. at the end of the day, this is a movie that is now a part of my collection right next to its predecessor, ""Two Can Play That Game"". ""Hollywood"" Will Packer and ""Big Time"" Bernard Bronner put their stamp on it so I had to check it out. I know I'm on point because I got mine through Amazon Prime but both of my daughters each bought one this week too, one at Wal-Mart and the other at Best Buy.",1203033600,8,2629,4.912162162162162

3049600,5,B0010NXURQ,"It took my husband and I a while to get into this movie. It was not a interesting as Two Can Play that Game.

3049602,1,B0010NXURQ,"Two Can Play That Game caught me off guard. When I first started watching it I started rolling my eyes. As the movie progressed I was laughing and was enjoying myself. The way the movie ended threw me off completely but that is what made that movie special. It tricks you into thinking you can predict how the movie is going to end up then BAM! Nice surprise. Three Can Play That Game is a soulless, unfunny, and mean-spirited sequel that is just as corny and weak as you would expect a direct-to-DVD sequel to Two Can Play That Game to be.

Story: Byron Thomson is caught by his girlfriend Tiffany(Jazsmin Lewis) in a compromising position with Carla(Kellita Smith), a TV executive. From then on Tiffany seeks the advise provided by Shante Smith(Vivica Fox) to help manipulate Byron and the relationship. Byron uses the advise from his best friend Gizzard(Tony Rock)to manipulate the relationship. Byron ends up using Shante's advise to help him manipulate Tiffany and Tiffany follows the advise of her friends, Linda(Terry Vaughn) and Monica(Rashan Ali) to manipulate the relationship.

As you can see the movie is very and confusing plus it doesnt even have the good intentions of its predecessor. Two Can Play That Game had a great message: You cant turn love into a game to be controlled because you will lose. Plus it was pretty clever in how it conveyed that message. This movie doesnt seem to have much to say plus its quite annoying to see these attractive brothers and sisters act like childish high-schoolers throughout the movie. I wouldnt have a problem if it were a means to an end but its not. Add that to the fact that this movie tries to use the same type of jokes from the first movie and fails.

Vivica tries to inject some personality into her character but she comes across as a huge douche bag(if you can call a female that), whereas in the first one she was a likable person with a wayward view of relationships and men. And her performance in this movie is quite forced. Jason George, Tony Rock and Jazsmin Lewis all give forced performances and it shows. Did I forget to mention that this movie is boring. Lethally boring.

In conclusion Three Can Play That Game is a direct-to-DVD sequel that will join the ranks of other bad direct-to-video sequels like House Party 4 and Home Alone 4. The humor falls flat and the movie doesnt even have heart(which the first movie has). Even if you haven't seen the Two Can Play That Game you won't like this one. This is Two Can Play That Game for the Lifetime crowd. Two thumbs down",1242432000,2,2546,4.613686534216336

The only real funny part was that Tony Rock was coaching his friend from a book that Anthony Anderson's character from the first movie wrote called "" The Man's Guide to Pimpin Panderan and Philanderan"" That was the only time I slightly cracked a smile. Oh and Ms. Ford was looking good which might ne worth the price if you pick it out the $.99 used and forgettable bargain bin at the local trade in video hut.",1237852800,,612,4.239316239316239

I tried watching it and it took me like 3 days to finish it.  I couldn't sit through it... it's difficult to be still long enough.  It did not capture my interest and it wasn't really that funny.  I gave this movie 2 stars only because my girl Vivica was in it. I suppose if I had not seen Two Can Play That Game, it would have been a little better but I was constantly comparing the two and... well there is no comparison.  I wanted to be able to give this movie good reviews but I simply cannot.  It's just not good.  Jason George is quite handsome, though. :)",1226534400,2,690,3.920863309352518

This is to say that I had expectations from the orginal movie that we all have when we really like the original that I felt were not met. I was kind of let down. It wasn't as well put together as the original and the female lead wasn't a very good actress, which changed the feel of the movie. I have seen the female lead in other movies but her parts were small so you didn't see much of her acting.  The concept was still the same as the original and I think with a different female lead, this could have been a much better movie. Vivica was just as great in her role as the original and the other cast memebers were great also.

3049611,3,B0010NXURQ,"Look Ima Vivica Fox fan, seen 85% of her movies,and consider myself somewhat of a fan of miss Fox. This movie was funny thanks to tony rock mainly and everyone else had funny things hear and there but felt kind of generic, predictable,and seen before.as far as a independent movie its pretty good. they knew that they had big shoes to fill from the first one though which had a power cast behind it like Moriss Chesnut, Mo'Nique, Gabrielle Union, Anthony Anderson, Bobby Brown, Tamala Jones and Wendy Raquel Robbinson, but one of my biggest problems was Mrs. Fox herself. In the original, the character Shante Smith seemed like a girlfriend giving the viewers advise (like one good friend to another) and the character seeme kind of peaceful and downhome with a few funny lines and gestures here and there, in this one she was all in your face and kinda drag queenish alot with the over makeup and dramatic hair, and just a coldness about the character so much that the original Shante wasn't they were completely different people, I liked the old one better because she felt like ""My girl shante"". In 3 can play that game she's  ""The almighty Shante""  larger than life, bow to her, no woman is ever as good as her. like a drag queen.

I still love Vivica though, thats my girl, from Independence day to set it off and even still with this movie. And don't get me wrong im not saying she did a bad job acting, but the characters aren't the same women at all, but she still made her funny and likeable

Its a good movie on its own, as a sequal it sucks though.
just my opinion, I (litterally) just finished the movie for a second time,so don't compare when you watch it, you might be disapointed too.",1206316800,,1699,4.470967741935484

The concept was still the same as the original and I think with a different female lead, this could have been a much better movie. Vivica was just as great in her role as the original and the other cast memebers were great also.

So a raining day movie is what this is.",1207785600,,754,4.053691275167785
3284106,2,B0010NXURQ,This movie was not even close to being as good as the first movie.  The only thing that prevented me from cutting it off was Tony Rock.  The story line was horrible.  It seemed as if the movie was rushed and there was a lot of over acting in this movie.  Horrible!!!!!!!,1206921600,,270,4.134615384615385

You should always no when to stop and do not spoil a good thing.  Its now time to stop.",1206403200,,152,4.066666666666666
3284108,3,B0010NXURQ,"Look Ima Vivica Fox fan, seen 85% of her movies,and consider myself somewhat of a fan of miss Fox. This movie was funny thanks to tony rock mainly and everyone else had funny things hear and there but felt kind of generic, predictable,and seen before.as far as a independent movie its pretty good. they knew that they had big shoes to fill from the first one though which had a power cast behind it like Moriss Chesnut, Mo'Nique, Gabrielle Union, Anthony Anderson, Bobby Brown, Tamala Jones and Wendy Raquel Robbinson, but one of my biggest problems was Mrs. Fox herself. In the original, the character Shante Smith seemed like a girlfriend giving the viewers advise (like one good friend to another) and the character seeme kind of peaceful and downhome with a few funny lines and gestures here and there, in this one she was all in your face and kinda drag queenish alot with the over makeup and dramatic hair, and just a coldness about the character so much that the original Shante wasn't they were completely different people, I liked the old one better because she felt like ""My girl shante"". In 3 can play that game she's  ""The almighty Shante""  larger than life, bow to her, no woman is ever as good as her. like a drag queen.

I still love Vivica though, thats my girl, from Independence day to set it off and even still with this movie. And don't get me wrong im not saying she did a bad job acting, but the characters aren't the same women at all, but she still made her funny and likeable

Its a good movie on its own, as a sequal it sucks though.
just my opinion, I (litterally) just finished the movie for a second time,so don't compare when you watch it, you might be disapointed too.",1206316800,,1699,4.470967741935484
3284109,4,B0010NXURQ,"This movies is similar to the other one two can play that game, it's okay get it.",1205193600,,81,3.823529411764706
3284110,5,B0010NXURQ,"I play the role of Co-worker #3, and this movie is worth buying just to hear me say ""I wish a buy would buy me flowers"" :) No seriously, this is a great follow-up to 2 Can Play that Game. It's witty and loaded with romantic comedy.

Great Date Movie!
