7862344,4,6304089449,"After I had watched the movie for the first time with our 2,5 year old son, I tried to hide it. It actually is quite ""spookable"", and I was afraid he would not be able to sleep. I bought him a replacement- a nice story with lots of songs and fun- but he insisted on getting spookable winnie back. Ever since, it has been his absolute favorite. And, by the way, he sleeps fine. I am sure he would give it a five. I continue to think there are other Winnie the Pooh stories around with more depth and beauty- the ranking is a compromise between a child's and a parent's perspective.",970185600,2,580,4.1875
