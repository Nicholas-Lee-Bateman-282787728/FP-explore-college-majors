No matter your sexuality, everyone can relate to being in love for the 1st time and wanting to spend every waking moment with that person no matter what anyone says. You may even be able to relate to wanting to run away with that special someone because no one understood the love you shared. All those crazy emotions and passion wrapped up in a teenage body and mind. And how many of us swore we would either never love anyone like that again or would die before someone separates us from ""the one""?
Yup, I'm raising my hand, too.
Watching Laurel Holloman (The L Word, Boogie Nights) and Nicole Ari Parker (Soul Food The Series and also Boogie Nights) in their 1st feature film as they projected so much maturity and chemistry really impressed me. The film is sweet & comical while demonstrating how difficult it can be to be yourself to your friends and family.

728899,5,6303909000,"***SOME SPOILISH MATERIAL IN REVIEW***

This mid-90s lesbian gem story is whether simplistic and surely a low-budgeted affair, yet the story itself with it's blend of humor, coming of age, and first love dimensions makes this picture worth the wild to watch over and over again.  The chemistry between Nicole A. Parker (star of later Soul Food the TV show) and Laurel Holloman (star of L-Word) are undeniably strong and real.  I love the fact the two characters who are involved in a romantic connection are in an interracial pairing, I don't see too much of this kind of pairing besides Bette/Tina and Tasha/Alice from L-Word and another films I liked once upon a time&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-Night-Is-Falling/dp/B000Z27HJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When Night Is Falling</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Watermelon-Woman/dp/6305799156/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Watermelon Woman</a>&nbsp;especially when it comes to black-white for lesbian movies or TV.

As for the storyline, Randy Dean is dealing with typical high school pressures from being picked on about her sexuality to possibly not graduating cause she's horrible at math.  Evie is raised by a single-black mother but brought in an upper-middle class lifestyle, popular at school, and has a boyfriend (that is whether needy and dramatic).  While Evie has mostly everything a lot of teen girls could ask for, she finds herself far from perfect and this causes her anxiety in early parts of the movie.  I guess this is why I appreciate the Evie character a lot.  As a black person, staying ""perfect"" can be hard when so many are waiting for you to screw up and be like, 'Told You So.'  Randy, does though, supplies that special feeling and ingredient Evie hasn't felt before.  The two girls build a strong connection after getting busted by a teacher for smoking in the school bathroom, which is whether cute and open as the two characters from two totally different backgrounds being to connect.  Evie's friends, however, finds that her relationship with Randy is quite appalling and weird later in most of the film, but Evie doesn't giving into their ignorance.  Randy deals with her own insecurities as it pertains to their growing bond because she's from the opposite side of the tracks and possibly flunking out the 12th grade.  To add to it, Randy is having a side-affair with a much older woman that Evie doesn't know about to mid-way into the movie.

Again, the movie is simple and even most cases to the point.  The balance of humor and teen romance makes the film a fun and easy watch that doesn't have sadness or heartbreak that some LGBT tends to have.  I highly recommend this for those who might of enjoyed their first romantic relationship from high school, college or whenever -- even if it didn't last forever.  Or maybe you could watch this with group of your close friends on movie night.  All in all don't pass this one up!",1355529600,,3021,5.2845188284518825

I can't remember how I came across this movie, but I remember I absoulutely enjoyed it! I was very happy to find it here on Amazon because I never forgot the movie, but I didn't own a copy on dvd. It's such a cute film and the girls even though they're complete opposites, share this innocence. A wonderful friendship of love, and non-conformity. The soundtrack was great, the girls were funny, and it was just a feel good movie. Nicole Arie Parker is just beautiful! Laurel Holloman nailed her role as portraying a tom-boy. I haven't seen another film similar to this one that I actually enjoy. I am glad that the director, Maria Maggenti, stepped outside of the box and was courageous enough to use two girls of different ethnicities for the leading roles. This brought great flavour to the film. It's wonderful to see that both ladies went on to further their careers.",1322438400,,1090,5.532934131736527

It is a low budget film, but it is pure genius. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies. Don't be fooled by the title.  It is not a lesbian movie.

As Randy, Laurel Holliman is excellent, and, unlike some other reviewrs, I thought Ms. Maggenti's script and direction were right on. I found nothing trite about it.

Otherwise, it is a great movie, especially when it was made by an unknown director with two wonderful young actresses that had a marvelous chemistry. I would recommend it for a heartwarming story, two great young actors, and for the fact that a movie can be made with a budget of $55,000, and still be very good, if not better than some of these mega-million productions.",1193875200,,605,4.260869565217392
729109,4,6303909000,"I think that the level on which people connect to this movie is directly related to what they think of it as a whole. On my part, I was willing to overlook the technical flaws and sometimes cheesy dialog because the characters really sucked me in. I was reminded of myself rather forcibly several times throughout the film, and because of my own experience found I could understand what Randy or Evie were thinking even when they didn't say it. Most Hollywood movies have so much of a story, they don't bother to create an underlayer of meaning or complete characters. This film, because it followed a standard format of teenage love, had some spare room to delve deeper. The best example I can make is Randy's giddy repetition of, ""I sing a body electric. I sing a body electric, I sing..."" as she rolls off her bed in happiness. This is an honest and heartfelt moment, that captures the essence of what the movie attempts to explain. Moments like these matter much more than camera angles or inexperienced supporting characters.

Incidently, I couldn't help but watch this movie twice in a row (one day and then the next), something I hardly ever do. I'm considering watching it again right now, as a matter of fact. Hm. I guess it's just one of those things.",1192838400,,1261,4.604444444444445

For a more believable (as well as more intelligent and erotic) young lesbian love story, check out the understated and off-beat BBC production, ""My Summer of Love"" (2004). A similarly themed film that's downright hilarious - and with a killer score to boot -- ""But I'm A Cheerleader"" (1999) is a gem. From the same year, ""Better Than Chocolate"" has it all - humor, originality, plot, dialogue, performances, and sensuality.

The only incredible thing about ""Two Girls in Love"" is that it got released in the first place, as without its lesbian twist it's little more than a third-rate Romeo and Juliet tale.",1155081600,6,867,5.223021582733813

I encourage everyone to see this movie a second time with the director's comment.  She did a fantastic  job with so many constraints, namely the money issue and a lot of really quirky stuff like Nicole Ari Parker not knowing how to drive the Range Rover.  Magenti methodically narates the movie and how it was made with a lot of effort, heart and sheer determination.  And ofcourse when you see the movie it shows thru.  I love how this movie is universal in interpreting the joys and angst of intense first love, gay or straight.  This movie was ofcourse completed twelve years ago, so the two main actresses look a little different now like Laurel Holleman, Tina in ""The L Word.""  And Parker (""Dancing in September"" and ""Boogie Nights."") The script is really tight, the funny moments are very right on and funny and the two actresses shared an amazing chemistry that didn't make the intimate moments akward, but rather sexy and genuine.  I love this movie, it is one of the better independent movies that I have ever seen.  And thanks to Maria Magenti for taking the time to comment on the movie.",1142208000,5,1234,4.589041095890411

729218,4,6303909000,"I was browsing through and saw that some of the more recent reviews of this movie were ragging on the low budget quality of the film, which completely overlooks what it achieved. So I felt I needed to add my two cents on a lesbian film that will always hold a special place in my heart.

If I'm recalling correctly, the budget for the movie was somewhere around $50,000. For what many people spend on a car, Maria Maggenti was able to make an entire movie of much higher caliber than one would ever expect in a world of millions spent to make schlock. In fact, for size of the budget Maggenti had to work with, it's a cinematic masterpiece. Okay, maybe that's laying it on a bit thick, but hopefully gets my point across.

The directing and the acting by the two leads are actually fairly top notch for an independant film, and the lack of funds mostly shows in the details. The script and acting is a bit over the top in places, but then in a lot of ways it's supposed to be. Just look at the title of the movie. The movie lacks polish in pretty much all areas, but for a basically no-budget first attempt, that is easily forgiven.

The story is heartwarming and does a nice job of depicting two teenagers coming of age who are from two completely different worlds where neither of those worlds has much respect for the other. It's also a good look at first love and all that entails, whether those involved are straight or gay.

The scene where the mom comes home to find the mess is still one of my favorites in any movie just because of the unexpectedness and hilarity of it. I also think that the music during their love making is one of the best matches of music to a love scene that I've experienced in a movie, probably second only to the use of Santana's Samba Pa Ti in ""If These Walls Could Talk 2"". (Unfortunately I have no idea who wrote that piece of music in ""Two Girls"" or what it's called.)

So yeah, it's a low budget film. But focusing on that blinds one to all the positives and neglects all the wonderful aspects of this movie. ""The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love"" is actually a triumph of independant film-making and shows just how much can be accomplished on talent and determination alone. It puts to shame all those movies out there made with more money, but less true understanding of what makes for a good movie. It is funny and sweet and no lesbian movie collection is really complete without it. I first saw it at an international film festival when it was originally released, I owned it on VHS, and now have the DVD version. I imagine I'll still be pulling it out to watch occasionally 20 years from now.",1134000000,27,2651,4.3582995951417

Yes, it is a low budget film, and yes, it had political importance in 'the scene', but as a stand-alone movie free of context and background, I would never recommend it.  It gets some credit toward the end for showing some self-awareness of how silly and dramatic the whole thing was.

I first caught it from the middle while flipping channels and then checked when it would be on again so I could see the whole thing.  It is a very different movie.  A tomboy, (I can't remember what her name was so for this write-up I'll call her Shawn) who lives with a lesbian mother and is taunted by everybody at school.  She also seems to be failing all her classes.  One day a girl (Evie) from her school happens into her mother's gas station.  On a whim, Shawn decides to see what Evie needs.  Apparently there is a problem with her tire.  Shawn is immediately attracted to Evie, who seems totally lost explaining her tire problem.  Evie seems to notice how Sean is looking at her and after she leaves the station, they each start thinking about the other.

Evie is the opposite of Shawn.  She is very attractive and hangs with the ""in"" crowd at school.  Evie has an egotistical, pushy boyfriend and one day has a fight with him at school.  She goes to the girls room and happens upon Shawn in the bathroom.  She then pours her guts out to Shawn who is totally sympathetic.

Shawn then starts telling her family clan that Evie is her girlfriend, though nothing has happened yet.  Shawn decides to get bold and writes Evie a note that she slips into Evie's locker at school.  Evie finds the note and says nothing of it for several days, while thinking constantly about Shawn.  Evie is battling her feelings for Shawn, worried that her snobbish girlfriends would look down on her if she even associated with Shawn.

Evie can take it no longer and goes to the gas station where she first met Shawn and strikes up a friendship.  The friendship starts to slowly bloom over a period of time with the girls sharing caresses and kisses.  When Evie's mother needs to go out of town for a weekend, the girls plan to take their relationship to the next step.

I don't want to give the rest of the movie away but just to say that it is fun with a few laughs thrown in.

The movie shows that just because someone is different, they can have the same feelings and desires as anyone else.  This is well worth renting or setting your VCR, if it is again shown on cable.",1092700800,38,2260,4.351674641148326

This mood this feeling (now I relate on the film) aw this is such a wondering feeling of me. You feel something which is in opposite with the world cause of one thing ... but you feel you are right ... and maybe you are much closer to the essence of things than others ... and the feeling you are to know this is so catartic. You throw some very unnecessary thing away and this makes you feel to be really free, you feel you fly above the world and nothing gonna stop you. And you feel yourself enough strong to break out of the wall and leave the show in which you would have to play a silly roleplay and what's more and this is the point you found a true girlfriend for you and what you feel is the beautest feeling of you which ever can build up in you and you say aw that's what I want that's what I waited for and you feel some miracle is about happen to you and the miracle is your split soul comes to one part and the other just found part is her. And the most distressing feeling that you are only a half is getting away and from only thinking about who and what you found a crawl comes and runs all over your body. This film tells you about a world which if once you found you could never turn back because in this world you find the essence of you, know what I mean. This film tells you about cracking up the door and what's behind drives you to a truly credible world which fully meets the deepest of you. Sex scenes ... well exactly there is no well evolved sex scenes in obscene way but this is the best way to draw well this world. A kiss, a kiss gives the most from you to your lover and that's the beautest way to tell her: my sweet princess you are the one. And both of you feel in fact you are in the doorway of another world ... and you are just lovin and kissin yourselves into it by holdin each other's hand. And the flower of your common soul is just ridin and ridin on to grow upon your hearts.

729479,3,6303909000,"""Incredibly True Adventures"" is a great coming-of-age-as-a-lesbian movie. It's easy to relate to because many of us can identify very closely with the circumstances of these girls' lives. It makes sense that a lot of young lesbian know, and love, this film.
On the first viewing, it provides plenty of giggles, suspense, and the sense of belonging that questioning teens can get from a movie like this. I, for one, felt a lot better after I watched this at 16. Now that it's been a while, it's just cute. The love scenes are great if you're in it for the sweetness, neither of the girls are that attractive, and it kind of seems like the femme one will eventually cast off her new lifestyle. Viewing a lot of other lesbian flicks made this one, therefore, seem average in a lot of ways. My friends and I own this, but it very rarely gets pulled off the shelf.

729612,3,6303909000,"The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in Love, was a film that I  really enjoyed.  The characters genuinely seem to have a sense of themselves, and the time that they are portraying, which creates a very sincere and realistic atmosphere.  The main characters in the film are Randy, a young rebel, reminiscent of James Dean in  Rebel Without a Cause, and Evie, a more conservative, naive girl that is struggling against the ideas of the mainstream.  The two girls' differences are very accented in the film, Randy is white and Evie is black, Randy likes rock music and Evie likes classical, Randy is a loner/loser and Evie has friends and is well liked.  The two girls meet at the gas station that Randy works at and somehow, against all odds, fall in love.  Their story is shown as their struggle basically against their families, their friends, and society as a whole to follow through with their feelings for each other.
 One aspect of the film that I didn't like was the relative ease of their feelings.  Most young teens in this society would have a much greater internal battle about the fact that they had feelings for someone of the same sex, and little of that was portrayed.  They seemed to move through their actions with relative ease.  However, overall I felt that most of their feelings and actions were done very well.
 The history of the film, and also some of the technical aspects are very worth mentioning.  The film was shot in a record 21 days, and none of the actors or crew members were paid.  All of the locations were homes, donated for free by gay men.  Also, the crew was for the most part female, which adds an interesting spin to how you look at the film.  It is an independent film, and that freedom shows through on the technical aspects.  Many of the shots are very creative, and go against the mainstream Hollywood style of film.  For example, some scenes are shot from above, looking down at the actors, to enhance the feeling of the moment, which isn't often done.  A great panning shot is used at one point in the kitchen of Randy's home, where you can only see the kitchen table, and see the waists of the actors, while they are making dinner.  It adds something incredible to the scene.  If you were to see this movie for anything, look to it for it's creative use of the camera, and the way that the technical aspects enhance the story.
 So yes, I would definitely recommend this movie to others.  A viewer should go into it with an open mind, and be ready to see a story that is simple, but real -- and heartfelt.",1033516800,12,2558,4.489177489177489

Also it takes great care to avoid the preachy and heavy handed treatment given to many coming of age novels. The result: a dynamic product that anybody regardless of sexuality can relate to.

Sure, the title may make some progressives flinch (after all, how many male chauvinist fantasies have been built on the ""amazing lesbian couple"" theme), but I was really proud in the way this movie's script was handled and thought the movie was done very respectively and tastefully. These women seek pleasure only for themselves, and not for oogling spectators who would reduce them to an exotic item. They are natural and three dimensional beings who are trying to find their place in the world.

I am not very overly emotional about films, so I was unprepared for the crying that followed Evie and Randy's hidding. Because these women dared to be themselves, they encountered tremendous amounts of hatred and fear from their town. Whether it was the director's and writers intention or not, that part of the film was the most dramatic (I did not think it was comedic at all). It reminded me of the many publicized hate crimes against gays and lesbians.

Granted the independent nature of the film (as well as the subject matter) made it really difficult to accheive box office sucess. But the world's loss is the gain of devoted fans of all backgrounds who know caring relationships when we see it. Apparently our society is well in need of a wake up call that heterosexuality does not neccesarily equal a great and stable relationship.",982108800,124,1688,4.833910034602076
729719,4,6303909000,"I've been watching movies for quite some years now, but it's only been recently, within the last year of so, that I've decided to try to broaden my horizons a bit, and take chances on movies I usually wouldn't watch.  With that in mind, I've started renting some foreign movies, and began picking up movies I had never heard anything about, or starred actors I had never heard of before.  That's how I came to pick up this movie, and I have to admit that overall, I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did.  I'm going to try to break the movie down into component parts, the cast, story, and things like that, and what I liked and didn't like about each.
 To start with, the cast.  As I mentioned, I had never heard of any of the people that starred in this movie, and to be honest, probably will never see them again, or recognize them.  The two lead characters, the two girls who fall in love, did a very credible job with their roles.  Watching them, I have to say I enjoyed watching their performances, and could believe that the two of them could possibly meet one another, find a spark of attraction there, and grow to be lovers.  Some of the supporting characters were a bit weakly played, but not all that bad, except for one in particular who fortunately, only appeared in two very short scenes.  This was the boyfriend of Evie, the African-American girl, who was very stilted in his acting, and never seemed at ease in his role, but then again maybe he was supposed to play him that way.  I don't really know, but I didn't really care for his acting ability.
 As for the story itself, it unfolded in a very natural way, and the script didn't seem to downplay towards the two girls, or force them to act before they were really ready, which too many teenage lover stories seem to like to do.  As a matter of fact, it's a good half way through the movie before Randy even tells Evie that she would like to hold her hand, and the awkwardness she displays there seems real to life, and further deepened my involvement in the characters lives.  Neither girl is portrayed as being stupid, as a matter of fact, they spend some time reading Walt Whitman's ""The Leaves of Grass"" to one another, and enjoy it.  By the time they do consummate their relationship, we know the two girls as well as they know each other, and fell glad for them.
 My main disappointment with the movie was the ending, which seemed kind of slapped on, and changed the mood of the movie.  Prior to it, I was enjoying the burgeoning love relationship the two girls were experiencing, and the end turns into a sort of slapstick farce where everyone introduced earlier in the story are brought together to a hotel where the girls have gone into hiding after having been found out.  It seemed a bit anticlimatic after the story I was enjoying, but not enough so to completely diminish the good feeling raised by the rest of the film.
 So, all things considered, I would have to recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something just a little bit different from what you usually watch.  If you are like me, I don't think you will be disappointed.",977356800,21,3147,4.422876949740035
729720,4,6303909000,"The story of a typical first love. Not as it happens to lesbian girls only but as it happens to almost everyone. The hesitation to touch, the lovely looking. This movie doesn't have incredible dialogues but the reactions are very true. Some scenes are so cute... like when they touch each other hands for the first time. And it has hilarious scenes too! I laughed a lot! I'm a lesbian teenager and I strongly recommend! U won't be disappointed.",973900800,15,444,4.632911392405063
729721,5,6303909000,"If you wonder what I mean, I had a girlfriend in high school who pretty much dated me to hide the fact she was a lesbian.  I loved her so much that  this hurt me for a few years and I almost couldn't forgive her.  I saw this  movie advertised in the paper and contemplated seeing this, but I was  completely afraid that I would just break down and cry and/or be consumed  with anger all over again, so I didn't watch it.  However after it came out  on video, I rented it, watched it, and found it to be so beautiful, that it  helped me actually get over the whole thing with my ex-girlfriend. I don't  know if it will do the same for you, but it is worth seeing.  You won't be  disappointed.",966816000,6,691,4.037037037037037

As is Nicole Parker (Evie), who you've probably seen in other films, one being ""200 Cigarettes"".  A  story of young love and the importance of finding out and embracing who you  are.  I recommend this movie for anyone, gay or straight.  Invite your mate  and hit the couch.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll enjoy.",963705600,19,420,4.885714285714286
729723,5,6303909000,I've had this movie for a couple of years now and I can still watch it over and over again.  The soundtrack is incredible (i've been searching for it and still no luck).  It's a delightful story of two teenagers in love.  I'm in my twenties and still struggle with my sexuality and society in  which I am surrounded by.  This little tale is a great coming out movie for  teenagers that have to with the cruelty of their peers in high school.  I've never had the nerve....It's also a great first date movie.

I personally liked the way some scenes  were shot (e.g. Evie, Randy, and Randy's family cooking dinner). Granted,  this film is not Oscar quality - but who cares!

729726,4,6303909000,"""Two Girls in Love"" totally shifted my way of thinking when I was smack dab in the middle of my coming-out process.  I must say that the girls, for the most part, had a much easier time with their 'first love' than seems realistic, but what the hell?  It's a nice story.  It's a sweet  movie, it'll make you want to go make a pot of cocoa and snuggle up with  your girlfriend.  There just aren't enough compassionate, un-tormented  lesbian films out there--- but this is ONE, and it's a good start.  You'll  like it! Tootles!",942019200,37,525,4.385416666666667

It's not the best I've seen no but out if all of them it holds a special place for me, mainly due to the fact I was about that age when I saw it and coming out,  it hit home.
It's not like Better Than Chocolate or But I'm a Cheerleader.  It's not ""colorful"" like a lot of queer cinema.  It's more of a realistic situation.  The acting isn't flawless but were they believable yes.  It perfectly captures the clumsy, awkward, dramatic nature of being a teenager head over heels.  If I wanted flawless acting is watch the Piano.",1466553600,3,702,4.133333333333334

7855351,4,6303909000,"This film has a special place in my heart. The film manages to address social issues, such as homophobia, economic disparity, educational aptitude, non-conventional family structures, rejection for coming out and finding love between two people who may seem too different to be together.  The film has small town charm if that makes sense. It is nice to see a film that has butch characters. Sadly, it is still rare even in 2016. The film captures the sweetness of falling in love for the first time and intertwines the literature of Walt Whitman's My Body Myself into the magic of self discovery. Both women are from very different socioeconomic backgrounds and home structures, but they find a way to appreciate their differences. They key is a willingness to try and understand where they do and do not intersect. I enjoy the voice over of the characters during different scenes that provide a reflection to the time shown on screen. Those moments sound like they are reading from their journals in the future. This adds to the feeling of it being a story from their pasts. One where they are honoring and remembering a relationship that greatly impacted their lives.",1466035200,5,1170,4.8793969849246235
