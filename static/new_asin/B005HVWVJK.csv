4706716,5,B005HVWVJK,"As a relatively young anime fan, I had never seen this series back when it first hit the States in the early part of the previous decade. Having only seen a couple of episodes of the original OVA series, I knew next to nothing about the characters or the setting.

""Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040"" has since become one of my all-time favorite anime series, and I even managed to successfully lobby to get in shown at my college's anime club. The cyberpunk motifs and well-fleshed out, mostly female cast is a nice contrast to the stereotypical post-""Lucky Star"" ""moe"" phenomenon of cute girls doing cute things. I liken this series to being a cross between ""Blade Runner"" and ""Robocop,"" along with certain elements of the bishoujo genre thrown in for good measure. It feels like it could have aired alongside Tenchi or Dragon Ball back during the Toonami days, but the story and themes, concerning the place of technology in man's future, make it as relevant as newer series like Ergo Proxy or GITS: SAC.

I think other reviewers have said enough about the story line. This is, unfortunately, a rather bare-bones release, but I am glad that Funimation has successfully saved it from becoming all too obscure.",1353715200,,1205,4.788461538461538
4706717,5,B005HVWVJK,Bubblegum Crisis is really cool. The futuristic neo-punk setting is unique and the characters are awesome. This was one of the first anime I ever bought and now almost 200 series purchases later I have to say it's still a favorite. This anime is timeless. I've probably watched it through 50 times or so and it never gets old. There's nothing stopping you from buying and loving this show so go for it. You'll really like it.,1349481600,,425,4.532467532467533
4706718,4,B005HVWVJK,"Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 is a remake of a famous 1980s anime that fleshes out the storyline more and allows for a lot of character development. At 26 episodes, a lot of time is spent on the various characters and none of them lack for attention. Rather than get into details, I will say this is a lot more intelligent than the sexy art indicates and that I stumbled upon the series by accident. Pretty girls in exoskeleton armor suits fighting rogue androids sounded pretty cliched, but the execution is so much better than that. Heavily elements of noir, both in visual design and character interaction got my attention and held it.

Yes, the main gals are all beautiful and sexily drawn, but they are all strong women in different ways. I think that was the biggest surprise of the show. Independent, feisty, and intelligent, they are very appealing characters. While the males are secondary characters, they are all well written too.

Then there is the fantastic soundtrack, with the explosive opening theme declaring the attitude of the whole production. Having one of the main characters being the singer of the vocal tracks added considerably to how well music, story, and visuals combined. If you like cyberpunk, a good story, or inventive battles, this is a good series to check out. I do dock it one star due to the unexpected nudity in the final two episodes. While not as detailed as R rated animes depict, it is more than the Barbie doll nudity of Spice and Wolf. Other than saying it had metaphorical reasons to be there, I can't say more due to spoiling the intricate storyline.

This edition by Funimation looks good and the art holds up fairly well despite being made in the 90s. That means 1.33:1 video, no widescreen. Sound quality is very good, which is absolutely necessary given the soundtrack. The case is decent, with sturdy leaves inside holding all four discs. The only real extras are the opening and closing themes presented without text. A thin card slipcase encloses the plastic case but is nothing to write home about. Still, it is a good bargain for a long series.

If you like this version of Bubblegum Crisis, I also recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-D-Police-To-Protect-and-Serve-Complete-Series/dp/B00005YUN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.D.

4706719,4,B005HVWVJK,"In 1987, there was an OVA called Bubblegum Crisis; a cyberpunk anime with heavy influence from films such as Bladerunner. Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 is not a sequel - but a remake of that OVA, released in 1998. Rather than being an OVA 2040 is a 26 episode anime. The collection in particular being reviewed is the Anime Classics box set released by Funimation. The set is 4 discs long, costs around $30 (unless you get ripped off like I did) and has very attractive packaging in my opinion. The only bad thing I have to say about this particular set is that the extra features menu consists of nothing but a clean opening and closing.

BGC2040 as I shall call it from here on out is, as I previously stated, cyberpunk. Cyberpunk is a genre of fiction taking place in the future where advanced technology is extremely prevalent and integrated, and artificial life or robots are common place. Some other good examples of cyberpunk anime are Akira and Ghost in the Shell. In the world of BGC2040, robots called Boomers take care of most hard and dirty work for humans. They do road work, and clean sewers and do all toher sorts of tasks that we don't like to mess with. There are also several boomers that are receptionists and hold other more important positions as well. The Boomers are produced by a megacorporation called Genum. Occasionally, somethign strange happens and a Boomer goes ""rogue"". It begins to fuse all technology around it, sometimes forming much more monstrous ""life form"" that it once was and aggressively attacks people and attempts to fuse with as many other Boomers and technologies as it can. The phenomenon of rogue Boomers is on a steady rise - but there's a problem. Genum is talking about shutting down the AD Police, a special Police department dedicated to dealing with rogue Boomers. Genum claims to have solved the rogue Boomer problem - the issue is that rogue Boomers are obviously becoming more and more common. Genum obviously has something up their sleeve. Who will save Tokyo from these technological monstrosities? Cute chicks in metal suits. Duh!

The Knight Sabers are a vigilante group created by Sylia Stingray (in the picture above, she is the one with long, silver hair on the far right). Sylia is actually the daughter of Dr. Stingray, the man who created the Boomers in the first place. She sees it as her own personal mission to stop rogue Boomers. In the begining of the Anime, there are only 2 active Knight Saber; Priscilla Asagiri (Priss), who is the Knight Saber in the blue suit in the above picture, and Nene Romanova, the one in pink. Sylia has retired temporarily, and the 3 before Priss and Nene are, at that time, deceased. they are soon joined by Linna Yamazaki, the one in green. They are quite the colorful cast, pun unintended. Priss is the lead singer of a rock band, and has more than enough attitude and angst for the whole team. Nene is a hacker extraordinaire, but is an operator for the AD Police by day. Nene is also very peppy and a bit immature. Linna is, in my opinion, the most interesting. She is a farm girl who moved to Tokyo specifically to seek the Knight Sabers after reading rumors about them on the internet as an urban legend. It's very enjoyable to watch the characters banter, and their personalities often clash quite harshly - but that's part of the fun. The Knight Sabers aren't the only characters of course. There are many other characters, such as Leon, an AD Policemen who has the hots for Priss. Too bad Priss despises the Ad Police. I could reveal more characters, but I cannot do so without risk of spoilers.

About half of each episode consists of the Knight Sabers' daily lives, and their social situations. there is plenty of comedy, drama and romance so there's a little something for everyone. Action fans won't feel left out either- that other half of the episode usually involves violent robot death! The fights in BGC2040 are quite varied. Some of them are very fast paced while others, because the foe is more dangerous, are slower paced battles of wit and strategy. Most of the major fights are quite long and take up at least 2 episodes. Some of these fights are very entertaining, and you really don't mind but a couple of the battles seem to drag on, and leave you saying ""they're still fighting this thing?!""

BGC2040 has a plot that is much more complex than I have explained - it takes a few twists along the way. There was no way for me elaborate beyond the very basics without spoiling something. This was my first anime that didn't air on Cartoon Network/Toonami. I was 12 then (and frankly had no business watching a MA rated anime) and a lot of the plot left me a little confused. I didn't fully understand it until I was about 16. The ending to this anime is somewhat open - this is a mixed bag. while it leaves plenty of room for fan speculation, fan fiction and the like, it leaves you with only a mild sense of clossure. This anime left itself open for a sequel, but it doesn't seem likely. That's alright though, because this one stands strongly on its own, and has a dedicated cult fan base. Comedy, romance, action, robots, girls, and explosions...what's not the recommend?",1346198400,10,5197,4.621212121212121
4706720,4,B005HVWVJK,"I really liked this anime and suggest it as an addition to any collection. It's full of action and has a fairly good ending. The only thing that brothered me is just hard for me to define. Something just left me flat. I enjoyed watching it, but I just didn't see it as 5 stars.",1332720000,,277,4.054545454545455

4706722,5,B005HVWVJK,"I am so very glad I stopped dragging my feet and purchased the BGCT 2040 collection!  I have some very fond memories of this version of the series -- it reawakened my love of anime and was wonderfully empowering to me as a female fan.  (Priss inspired me to start riding motorcycles!)  This is a great series and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves things mecha.  Even though it's got a strong female ensemble cast, the series is strong on action, gritty character development and great story.  Although this is an 'older' title, it's aged fairly well; fluid animation in the fight scenes, good dub, and character designs that don't all look alike!  At the price you just can't go wrong, so score a piece of anime history and enjoy.",1326499200,16,733,4.557251908396947

I'm a huge mecha & cyberpunk fan and this anime is just what I wanted! I could not stop watching! Two things that I'm not a big fan of are the vocies for the cast and they made the suits look like they have heels...but I've gotten over them.

The backgrounds have that rich, detailed, old school anime style. The character designs and mecha are nicely done. As for the animation... I've seen better, even in a television series. I looked forward to the sequences of Priss performing her concerts. That's what I enjoyed about the original series: the songs and the epic action sequences. To me, it doesn't surpass the original, though it's pretty cool. They should have focused more attention on animating Priss' performances, in my opinion.

8473843,5,B005HVWVJK,"It is just over 30 years since this OVA series began, and it has stood up remarkably well, despite multiple authors, lawsuits between participants, truncated series, reboots, and no definitive ending.  That such a thing is even watchable today is amazing, that most (but not all) of it has appealed to so many different viewers over so many long years is a tribute to the genius (mostly) displayed in creating it.  You won't like all of it, for too many different directions were tried, but you will likely like most of it, and of how many things is that true?

Lets begin with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crisis/dp/B0002TSZME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crisis</a>&nbsp;(1987-1991), a probably intended 13 half-hour-to-hour-long episode series, cut short to just 8.  In 2032 just seven years after Tokyo was hammered by the Second Great Kanto Earthquake, a colossal corporation, Genom, is rising, unchecked by the government entities it corrupts or owns.  Its products are artificial cybernetic lifeforms that are usually in the form of humans, with most of their bodies being machines.  These wondrous inventions do great good for mankind,... when they are working properly.  When they are not working properly, by accident or design, they become a menace to life, and are subject to destruction by the largely overworked and outmatched AD Police and the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of powered exoskeleton equipped mercenaries.  Interestingly, the ultimate goal of the Knight Sabers is not to destroy Genom, against whom most members have a blood debt or two, but rather to control it by destroying only its most destructive projects, products,... and people.

The first three episodes form a loosely contrived trilogy introducing the Knight Sabers, explaining their origin, depicting their struggles, and showing their ultimate triumph over the schemes of Genom executive Brian J. Mason.  This is followed by a single episode savage road duel between an automobile driver and a motorcycle gang, then by a two-episode heartbreaker about love-dolls, apparent vampirism, and Genom corruption.  The last two episodes involve a character with a vendetta (based upon the events of an earlier episode), and a final episode focussing on Nene.

Unfortunately, now the two rights holding companies began to angrily split apart, forcing all sorts of problems.  A truncated 3 OVA episode version of the arguably intended ending of the Bubblegum Crisis series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubblegum-Crash/dp/B00008G6U3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubblegum Crash</a>&nbsp;(1991), was produced, but it pales somewhat in comparison with the preceding (being a bit too silly), though it is necessary to watch for fans of the original.  An additional truncated 3 OVA prequel series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AD-Police-Files/dp/B0002J4X3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AD Police Files</a>&nbsp;(1990), depicting the origin and earlier adventures of character Leon McNichol, was also produced, but it is overly downbeat and depressing, not to mention inconclusive about the fates of characters other than Leon, especially his first partner.

Next are the reboots, and as near as I can tell, no serious attempt was made to link any of these together.  The first was ""Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040"" (1998-1999), a 24 episode TV series plus 2 OVA episodes reboot of Bubblegum Crisis and Bubblegum Crash.  Now, as a rule, I don't think much of reboots for obvious reasons: Wow, the original was brilliant, unique, nothing quite like it!  How can we achieve similar success?  I know, lets COPY it!...  (What can possibly go wrong with that, the world wonders?)  More seriously, the problem with doing this (which I don't recommend by the way; instead Id advise adding sequels to the original story) is how do you do it successfully?  Steer too close to the original, and (unless your animation really is better, which it usually isnt, especially if you are going from OVA to TV) all youve got is a copy.  Whoopee.  Steer too far away, and you risk destroying whatever appeal the original had for its audience.  For this reason IMHO most reboots aren't worth your time, but there are exceptions, and one Im thinking of involves&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Double-Trouble/dp/B00015HUUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Double Trouble</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Final-Force/dp/B0001KNHU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Final Force</a>&nbsp;the 4 episode OVA series and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Decode/dp/B00BLQRFSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty: Decode</a>&nbsp;the 25 episode TV series, plus 1 OVA.  At first glance, with the OVA series animated by Madhouse and the TV series NOT animated by Madhouse, it should have been no contest, but the TV series succeeds by being better written.  For one thing the main male character is less of a whiny wuss and more of a thoughtful contrast to Birdys insane recklessness.  In addition a lot more thought was put into the complications of Birdys life and universe, including the whole hilarious Birdy_pretends_to_be_a_model/idol running joke.

Similar things are going on in Bubblegum Crisis, Bubblegum Crash versus Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040.  The biggest problem with the original IMHO is that except for the 3 episode opening and the 3 episode Bubblegum Crash closing, there is no particular structure to the 5 episodes in the middle, and most of the several different creators seem to have focused on Priss, excepting the 8th episode focusing on Nene.  In contrast Sylia is largely a mystery, and Linna is largely a nonentity.  However, in Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040 all four of the main characters are more carefully plotted out and, in particular, are a lot more in conflict with each other, both over Sylias secrets from them... and problems with each other.  A number of things brought over from the original series are more carefully planned, explained, and implemented in the reboot; in particular Mackey Stingray has been significantly changed.  Finally, the multi-episode stories have no original series equivalent.  About the only criticism Id make of the reboot is that in contrast to the careful plotting of the beginning and the build up to the end, the final events of the ending seem a bit confused and rushed; however, it is noteworthy that it does make considerably more sense in the Japanese with English subtitles format.

Next, although arguably a prequel, is the 12 episode TV series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-D-Police-To-Protect-and-Serve/dp/B00005YUN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve</a>&nbsp;(1999); essentially its a cop show about the adventures of a couple of mismatched partners,... REALLY mismatched partners, who just happen to serve in the A.D. Police.  On the one hand it is pretty well written, and, unlike AD Police Files, this series actually has an ending; on the other hand, it is rather poorly animated and has a fairly downbeat and depressing ending, which goes with the downbeat and depressing halfway point.  Now, if you like cop stories, you will probably like this; there is definitely some clever writing about the problems of being a cop at any time, in any situation.  However, the science fiction seems a bit underwritten.

Last is the 3 OVA episode series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Parasite-Dolls/dp/B0083QJVJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Parasite Dolls</a>&nbsp;(2003), which is arguably another reboot since its connections with A.D. Police: To Protect and Serve (or AD Police Files for that matter) are iffy at best.  Yet Another Serious Look at the Underbelly of Tokyo/Genom City starts out pretty well, if pretty dark and grim, but the individual episode endings don't make much sense, and the final episode is so off the charts insane that it really messes up the series IMHO.

Note: Naked female breasts pop up infrequently but occasionally in many of these shows (in the OVAs) so be ye warned.
