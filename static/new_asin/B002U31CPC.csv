8380925,5,B002U31CPC,"Feel the love in this all-new 6teen DVD.  This has the following three episodes:

""Stupid Over Cupid"" - Jonesy attempts to sell himself on the streets by being an eligible date up for bidding.  Then things get a little out of hand.  Meanwhile, Wyatt tries to make the perfect date for him and Serena, but his plans don't go as planned either.

""Cecil B. Delusioned"" - Jonesy tries out his new video camera by staging a prank on Nikki.

""The One With the Text Message"" - Wyatt is shocked that Serena broke up with him on a text message; therefore, he has to find out why.  Also, Jen and Caitlin fight over a dress.

Surely these episodes may also be on the ""Season 1, Volume 2"" DVD set, whenever that will come out.  But still, you'd be surprised how teenage love comes and goes.",1265414400,3,778,4.347222222222222
