2613873,5,B000GI3RHE,"This is the final volume of the series and all I could really say at the end was ""wow"". If you've enjoyed any sci-fi anime in the past, this series is for you. Great way to finish things off for the Stand Alone Complex series, the only down side is, now I'm really looking forward to Solid State Society!",1167782400,,304,4.169491525423729
2613874,5,B000GI3RHE,"All of Gohda's plans seem to be coming to fruition in this last volume of the 2nd Gig as the city authorities still believe that the immigrants in Dejima have a nuclear device in their possession. Only a few people know it's all a fake and ironically, in the world of Ghost in the Shell where pictures and voices can be faked so accurately, noone would believe it if they said there was no bomb! So it's up to the Major and her team to expose Gohda's plot in a backdoor type of play as they airdrop into Dejima even as the wounded Ishikawa tries to deliver illicit plutonium to the authorities in a bid to prove the substance isn't in Dejima. Meanwhile, the prime minister has been arrested by one of her own cabinet members along with Aramaki and Togusa. Ghoda also has a trump up his sleeve in the form of an American nuclear submarine waiting in the depths, which is prepared to wipe out all the immigrants!

The plots of the two Ghost in the Shell tv shows were a little too complicated to be wrapped up in the last few episodes, but the first season was much more successful doing this than the 2nd Gig. It seems like the staff tried to rush things when you probably needed about 3 more episodes to truly bring resolution. This volume was still excellent and had some beautiful moments, especially between the Major and Kuze while they are trapped beneath a mountain of rubble and perhaps realize they knew each other as children. To me, the greatest heroes of the show have been the Tachikomas, who seem to have a greater sense of loyalty, right and wrong, and sacrifice for the team. The animation as always is first rate and the voice acting is second to none. Along with its first season, it is probably one of the top 5 greatest anime. It just needed a little more time to resolve the very complicated issues it raised.",1167264000,,1829,4.411242603550296

8132668,5,B000GI3RHE,"I am not a big anime guy. Frankly, I have watched and enjoyed only a handful of the classic anime films, Akira, and some others. But GITS was the only one I swear by, The characters are human (err realistic, as opposed to classic anime), Don't go cartoon freak out with a spray of sweat. It's more like a realistic portrayal of a futuristic society, and the unit known as Section 9 that does it's best to defend or uncover the truth - often hidden by its political leaders. As for the voices of the Tachikoma, they are supposed to be childish as throughout the story they become more sentient as the series progresses (The humans become more machine - the Machines more human). It's more a cohabitation than an opposition. From the first Manga (1989) by Masamune Shirow and the movie Ghost in the Shell (1995), the issues facing the characters have been ones of privacy, safety, equality, in a world that is interconnected on the information/communication level (they use wires since Wi-Fi did not exist it's a homage to the original). Certainly, Masamune Shirow was ahead of his time, as these are the issues we face every day. One note worth mentioning is these series and movies (and graphic novels) all tend to start fresh. The TV series is not a continuation of the movie. For various reasons they reinvented the storylines, but you can find all about that elsewhere. Enjoy!",1517961600,,1379,4.679012345679013

I've been known to just watch this dvd over and over with out bothering with the rest of the sieries.

not like any of the other dvds are bad though....",1179792000,,372,3.7088607594936707

8132675,5,B000GI3RHE,"Most animes are not inspirational. That doesn't mean they're not good, they can be really good but to be inspirational is yet another optional step to connect with a certain audience. The reason I like SAC 2nd Gig is because there is really no one ""bad guy"" that must be vanguished for the world to make sense again and morality to be reinstalled. The world never makes sense from the very beginning, and it continues to be enigmatic up until the very end. Some people would call this an unresolved story. I call it a genuine emulation of the real world. A world where even though teamwork and communities work hard to bring about a better world, individuals still feel very lonely. Isn't that everyone's real dilemna? Even with so many friends, why are we so lonely? The fact that our behavior is fueled primarily by neurochemical stimulation and plasticity does not make this existential crisis any better. What do we do? Some of us resort to fables and fairy tales to get some sleep at night. Others become megalomaniacs (Kuze, Gouda). Others try to restore (install) some sense of justice to the world (Motoko, Batou and Section 9). Others put all their efforts into worshipping and following a hero (refugees). Believe it or not, some people just withstand it and go on with life disregarding all injustices and just attempting to live a life of comfort and security.  (Japanese citizens, Nietzche's Last Man). It is very evident solitude is a key theme in SAC 2nd Gig. It is also evident the writers of this show are very erudite. In a way, 2nd GIG is like a pastiche of real life and various existentialist works (I detected abit of Nietzsche, Sartre, Dostoevsky, and Kierkegaard).

If you're a fan of overthinking plotlines and creating structures and comparisons that never existed in the first place. This is a gold mine. If you just want a good anime, this is also a good anime. But I urge you to let it tickle your brain a little. Let it create a spark.",1169164800,,1965,4.64367816091954
8132676,5,B000GI3RHE,"I actually bought whole set of 2 Gig, collectable edition, because I enjoy the show and thought of it as an investmet.  As it turns out, I was shipped all of 2 gig, except vol. 7, which was actually vol. 7 of the first season.  I watched the 1st season for the first time, and really enjoyed it too.  It is somewhat different from 2 gig.",1168905600,,337,4.075757575757576
