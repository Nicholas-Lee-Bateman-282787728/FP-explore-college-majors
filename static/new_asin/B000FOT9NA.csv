8125387,1,B000FOT9NA,"I have no problem with this lady but for someone to label her the ""most beautiful woman in the world"" is downright ridiculous. Even she should say, that's stupid, don't give me that title. She is only attractive with some green/blue eyes. Maybe bcz her people have never seen their type with those colored eyes, that they are amazed at her looks. We can never say that person is the most beautiful, bcz you haven't seen everyone and everyone has different tastes. My opinion is Angelina is much more beautiful. Inside too, with her caring for the world. This lady looks like a bird. I thought 60 mins were more intelligent than this.",1188518400,3,633,4.610619469026549
8125388,4,B000FOT9NA,"Aishwarya Rai is without a doubt a most enchanting beauty.  Virtually every moment of this DVD is captivating.  Now, for the review . . .

As ""60 Minutes"" segments go, this was typical, but quite a bit short.  Only 13 minutes; too bad.  Hosted by Bob Simon, this show aired on January 2, 2005, and had the ""gee whiz"" feel of introducing to a supposedly unknowing American audience a gorgeous celebrity and her dilemma of crossing over to a film industry with a different culture and mindset.  Good timing, I suppose, because ""Bride and Prejudice,"" Aishwarya's first English language film, was due to open stateside a month later.

The filming/interviews took place in India, so we see throngs of adorers at a temple (the pretty actress got more attention than Ganesh, it seems) plus a couple of delightful scenes:  one in a restaurant where Aishwarya orders food with abandon, and another in a clothing boutique where she dons some stunning outfits and gets Mr. Simon to wear a Nehru jacket.  Through the narration, we learn that Aishwarya was studying to be an architect, won the Miss World pageant (1994), was a classically trained dancer, and was still living with her family.  There's also discussion of why there's no kissing in Indian film, and what Aishwarya might do were she told by an American film director to kiss someone.  Aside from one goof, that of proclaiming Bollywood as ""India's film capital,"" the reporting was mildly informative, fairly diverse, and consistent in reminding the viewer of the subject's beauty.  Interspersed between interview segments were some snippets of Bollywood film dance scenes, but not enough for the viewer to really get a grasp of the flavor of Mumbai-based filmmaking.

Aishwarya held her composure the whole time, and was very gracious is answering (carefully) what was asked of her (carefully) about personal matters.

I'm a lover of documentaries, so I'll admit to being bummed over the 13-minute run time, and ZERO extras.  So much more could have been done with this . . . maybe someday a feature length bio will be available.",1181001600,6,2080,4.919770773638969

8125390,5,B000FOT9NA,"Growing up in suburbia, my only portal to the outside was the tv. Blonde, beautiful, and well cleavage used to be the old fad. But aye caramba, with the influx of globalization, Americans get a taste of exotic beauties like

Aishwarya. Smart, beautiful, and talented, what more could you ask for. According to this video she is the most well known actress in the world commanding an audience of 3 billion+ viewers. It's a pity I wasted my life without knowing her :*(",1172966400,,467,4.626506024096385
8125391,4,B000FOT9NA,"Aishwarya Rai is the most beutiful woman in the world, and I'm glad to see that 60 minutes has finally, noticed that. She exudes beauty, and now everyone in the world who hasn't gotten a chance to find that out, can see for themselves in this feauture. She was Miss World, an incredibly talented film actress overseas, and now Americans can get a bit of her too. Angelina Jolie doesn't have anything on her.",1166400000,,407,4.513513513513513

8125393,1,B000FOT9NA,"I was very dissapointed by this dvd. I was expecting to see the most beautiful woman in the world.  Aishwarya Rai maybe a top actress of Bollywood but She is not the most beautiful woman in the world. Her look is quit common---blue/green eyes, dark hair, 5'7--- she looks a bit funny and ordinary like most woman you see on the street. 60 minutes may want to do a more intense search to found the most beautiful woman in the world. A note to 60 minutes ""The world's most beautiful woman"" is a model whom I see in my native Europe on many billboards, her name is unknown.",1162425600,3,570,4.277777777777778
