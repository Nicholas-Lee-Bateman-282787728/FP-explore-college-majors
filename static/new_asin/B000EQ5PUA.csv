Gregory Helms vs. Kid Kash

Would have liked another invitational type match but they already had one at the last 2 paper views.  Should be nice fasted paced action though.

Prediction: Helms

2. Interpromotional Money in the Bank Ladder match

RVD v.s. Carlito v.s. Shelton v.s. Hardy v.s. Lashley v.s Flair

Hopefully they use both brands because you can't have a ladder match without Hardy. I love Flair but get him out of the match.

Prediction: RVD

3. Champs v.s. Champs: Kane & Show v.s. MNM

This will be made because neither of them have a match but should be pretty good to see who are the better champs

Prediction: MNM

4. Hardcore Match: Edge v.s. Cactus Jack

This will happen and betta be a hardcore match. Look for one like the one with Randy from Backlash 04. Tacks, barby, chairs, steps, and tables all make appearances in a great match.

Prediction: Edge

5. Undertaker v.s. Henry

This will happen because Henry will screw Taker in his rematch with Angle on SD! He was suppose to screw Taker at No Way Out but Taker probably convinced someone not to have Henry ruin their classic match.  Should be good with a huge tombstone to end it.

Prediction: Undertaker

6. Shane and Vince McMahon and Masters v.s. Shawn Michaels and Janetty

I think the wwe was just bluffing the Vince/Shawn match and will change.  A regular match with Vince and Shawn would be boring, so hopefully they change it to this or this might be a raw match

Prediction: Michaels

7. WWE Title Match: HHH v.s. Cena

Should be a good/brutal match. Lots of near falls but a typical Cena match where he hits an FU out of nowhere. Tragically Cena will win again to extend the feud.

Prediction: Cena

8. Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Title

Angle v.s. Orton v.s. Mysterio

Match of the Year. Should be great, highflying action from the top 3 wrestlers in the business (maybe RVD instead of Orton). Look for an RKO on the steps, a cool table spot on Randy and Angle, Angle slam from the top rope, and much more.  This is the toughest one to predict but I'll go with Rey

Predicton: Rey Mysterio

This should be a great Mania. Hopefully they have more multie person matches like fatal four ways or another cruiserweight invitational so they use their whole roster.",1141257600,,2293,4.615384615384615

It was very brutal and had an incredible ending with Mick Foley being speared through a flaming table thanks to Lita. Another fantastic match was the no holds barred match between Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. This match was ""Match of the Night"", with many great spots in the match including: Shawn Michaels doing a flying elbow of a ladder straight to McMahon on a table with a trash can over his head.

2529218,5,B000EQ5PUA,"I really enjoyed this Wrestlemania! As I said in my Wrestlemania 21 review, it's always the greatist event ever where we see dream matches come true and moments become legendary.

World Tag Team Champions Big Show & Kane vs. Carlito & Chris Masters- Not a whole lot can be said about the match, but it was a fine opener to begin this ppv. Big Show & Kane a fine monster team and they were enteraining together (Look up Big Show trying to save Kane). Carlito & Masters were also fine together. Not much to say, but it gets things started.
6/10

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair vs. Matt Hardy vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Finlay vs. Shelton Benjamin- Like the year before, MITB was a fantasic match! Everybody was the perfect choice in this match and everybody took a ton of hits. Benjamin once again proved why he was one of the best athletes ever (Why did WWE ever placed this guy in main events). But I was happy that RVD won this match to earn the brief case that earned him title shot at ECW's One Night Stand where he became WWE champion!
9/10

U.S. Champion Chris Benoit vs. J.B.L.- This was a fine match! Any match with Benoit always turned out to be great and J.B.L was a fantasic heel! They worked well together and they show that the US title should mean something. a decent match.
7/10

Hardcore Match: Mick Foley vs. Edge- Hands down, MATCH OF THE NIGHT!!! This was Foley's first match since 2004 and he set has it. Edge proved to the world why he should be considered one of the best. Both take nasty bumb like Edge falling on tacks to Foley getting speared on a burning table. This is the match to watch on this PPV! Still, it makes me wonder why Edge didn't main event this WM.
10/10

Boogeyman vs. Booker T & Sharmell- ........
0/10 Booker T deserves better!

Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James- I have to admit, I enjoyed this match. This was better than the year before and it told an interesting story. Trish's year long reign ends and Mickie James proves that she is a great woman wrestler!
7/10

Casket Match: Undertaker vs. Mark Henry- This was a match that was better than what people give it credit for. Undertaker is one of the best and he is one of my favorites. Mark Henry is a decent ""big man"" wrestler and he does a fine job here. Taker does an awesome dive over the top rope which was the first time he done this in years. A fun match, but it was predicible. Come on, Henry to break the streak?
7/10 14-0, the streak lives on!

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. McMahon- I wouldn't call this a match, but it was fun. Whenever Vince gets owned, it's great. But I think this was a step below for Shawn Michaels after the last three years of having great matches. But why is everyone saying this match was pefect and giving it 10/10 and even say it's a Match of the Year? Come on, this wasn't really match since Vince barely fought! Still, it was entertaining though. Shawn does the DX chop before the end and it was a foreshadowing of DX's return.
7/10

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton- I have to admit, this was a great match but it's ruined by one flaw. One glaring flaw that makes it forgetable, it's very short! This match was getting started until it reaches it's 9 minute mark. All three men worked well together and it had the mark of becoming a classic. It's only thanks to the run time of the match that keeps it from getting it rated higher. I also feel Rey's victory was empty because he seemingly won because of Eddie's death. This helped begin the exploitation of Eddie's death which was one of the worst thing WWE has ever done. 8/10

Pillow Fight Match: Torrie Wilson vs. Candice Michelle- Oh god! Why was this match even on the card? Heck, why was this match before the main event? Was seeing Divas in their underwear worth more than an extra 10 minutes of World Title match? Skip this match at all cost!

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Triple H- This was a fun main event! Triple H came out with a great enterance with a new Motorhead songs ""The King of Kings!"" While Cena came out to a odd ""Gangster"" enterance (Watch for CM Punk as one of the mobsters). The match itself was fun with the crowd really getting into it. Lots of ""yays"" and ""boos from the crowd. Both men really worked well together as this was the first time they ever fought. There are a couple of funny bits like Triple H low blowing both Cena & The Ref and Triple H also doing the DX chop like Shawn Micheals did eariler that night. Everyone thought Triple was going to win until Cena used The STFU on him and actually made him tap. Not the way I would have ended it, but it's fine because this match was fun anyways. 9/10!

Overall, this isn't the best Mania and the year before was better. But I still recomned watch this because it's Wrestlemania. The MITB match, Edge vs. Foley and Triple H vs. Cena were the best matches of the night and they are what I think about when I think about this particular Wrestlemaina. So please, give it a watch.",1349913600,,5023,4.32624867162593
2529219,4,B000EQ5PUA,"This WM is one of my favorites from the past decade.  We're not forced to agree with stupid celebrity appearances and promos to put over the ratings.  Instead we get a lot of originality and innovation.  Aside from one or two sleepers, this is a great show, well worth some money.

World Tag Titles
Big Show & Kane vs. Chris Masters & Carlito:
The team of Masters and Carlito was assembled a few months prior, around the time of NYR in the Elimination Chamber, and WWE throws Kane and Show together every once and a while and gives them the belts (for some reason).  This match is actually pretty good considering who's involved.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Ric Flair vs. Matt Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Finlay:
This was the second appearance of the MITB ladder match, making its debut back at WM21.  This was easily the better of the two, and perhaps one of the best in the series.  This is also before they started throwing 8 or 9 men together just to get them involved in WM.  Anyway, this is the usual highlight reel, spotfest of a match, but it is very very good, with some great execution and innovation.

United States Title
Chris Beniot vs. JBL w/ Jillian Hall:
To me, this was a ""filler"" match that was thrown together in the last makings.  They had no heat coming into the night.  This made for a decent match though.  It was a little slow though, with few, if any, spots that you're going to remember twenty minutes later.

Hardcore Match
Mick Foley vs. Edge w/ Lita:
This was one of the matches I was really looking forward to on the night.  Boy did this one deliver.  Foley did a great job of pushing Edge over, as he looked GREAT here.  I don't think it was as great as Orton/Foley from Backlash 2004, but it was still one of the best hardcore matches I've seen.  There is tons of brutality and weapon use.  The Chicago crowd was alive the whole time.  This turned out to be one of the best matches of the night.

Two-on-One Handicap Match
The Boogeyman vs. Booker T & Sharmell:
This was a loathsome waste of time as the Boogeyman looked like a fool as he always did and Booker T's talent is put to waste.  Come on, now.  At least it was short.

Women's Title
Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James:
Based on their match at NYR, I was expecting big things from these two.  James' character had completely gone over the top by this time.  Despite a couple of missed spots, this was a GREAT women's match.  Both Stratus and James looked excellent here.  I've never seen so much crowd response in a divas match before.  This actually comes to turn out to be one of the best matches on the night.  This is also the last good women's effort at WM dating all the way til today.

Casket Match
Undertaker vs. Mark Henry:
Despite it being a casket match, this was easily one of Taker's most forgettable WM matches.  Taker does a pretty decent job of working with Henry, so it comes off as a pretty good match.  Also has a pretty predictable ending as no idiot in his right mind would predict Mark Henry, of all people, to be the one to end Taker's streak.  Good match, but easily forgettable.

No Holds Barred Match
Vince McMahon vs. Shawn Michaels:
They had a decent storyline buildup before this match.  While this wasn't anywhere near the standards of the earlier hardcore match between Foley and Edge, it was still pretty hard hitting and believable.  It has shown that the only way Mr. McMahon is going to put on a ""decent match"" is when he gets beaten by a fan favorite (Flair/McMahon, Taker/McMahon, Austin/McMahon).  Just call this one an addition to that saga, and we'll all say we enjoyed it.

World Heavyweight Title
Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton vs. Rey Meysterio:
WWE made Meysterio win the Royal Rumble, so I was honestly expecting him to win this match.  Aside from being able to predict the ending, this was a great match from Smackdown.  There was tons of innovation and some great spots.  It had kind of unforeseen ending, which was a bit surprising, but nonetheless a very strong main event.  I had no problems with any part of it.

Playboy Pillow Fight
Candice Michelle vs. Torrie Wilson:
I wouldn't have minded this as much as I did if it were earlier in the card, but unfortunately it falls here between the two main events and completely kills the momentum going from the Word Title match.

WWE Title
John Cena vs. Triple H:
This had much better length than the Smackdown main event.  This was also Cena's first of many WM main events to come.  It was a really great main event, with Cena actually using a variety of moves and counters.  It's a shame they have Triple H tapping out in two straight WM main events though.  Anyway, it was a great match, that maybe fell slightly short of the triple threat from earlier in terms of ring psychology, but nonetheless was still a stellar main event that the live crowd really got into.

I really liked the theme and manageable hype that WWE exercised for this night.  There were plenty of ""BIG TIME"" moments, as Peter Gabriel would suggest, and tons of enjoyment.  Fortunately, you can get this one for a very fair price.  The DVD set has tons of extras as well.  Enjoy.",1304467200,,5173,4.446808510638298

2529221,4,B000EQ5PUA,"The best matches were The Money In The Bank ladder match,the Edge-Mick Foley match which was a good throwback to ECW in the 90's and the WWE championship between HHH & John Cena which was a good soild back-and-forth match. The worst matches were The handicap match between the team of King Booker & Sharmell against The Boogeyman which was a bad throwback to WCW's dying days and The PlayBoy Bunnie Pillow fight which was crud regardless of what men think of it. The HBK-VKM Streetfight was kind of one-sided with Vinnie Mac only getting a few shots but it was still losing badly in the end making this a very dumb match. The 3 way bout for the World's Championship between Rey Mysterio,Kurt Angle & Randy Orton was short but sweet. The rest of the card were good soild matches.

Kane and Big Show vs Carlito and Chris Masters
-Decent match, general tag team match nothing too special

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
-Great match, definitely lives up to a Wrestlmania quality match

JBL vs Chris Benoit
-A decent technical match, enjoyed their chemistry in the ring, although could have been better

Edge vs Mick Foley

Shawn Michaels vs Vince McMahon

Rey Mysterio vs Kurt Angle vs Randy Orton
-I am not a fan of triple threat championship matches, especially at Wrestlemania but this proved me differently.  Nice, solid match.

Torrie Wilson vs Candice
-The only good thing about this match was when it ended.  The two could have had a better match but the pillow fight stipulation ruined it

John Cena vs Triple H
-This was a little overdone, especially with the entrances but the overall match was so back and forth it keeps you on the edge of your seat.

2529225,5,B000EQ5PUA,"What a Wrestlemania this turned out to be. The dark match before the show which is an 18 man Battle Royal match was won by Viscera.

The first match that was broadcasted is a tag team match between Big Show and Kane vs. Carlito and Chris Masters for the World Tag Team Championships. Not a bad match but it was pretty slow. Kane and Big Show win. I give this a 6.5 out of 10.

The second match was Money in the Bank. Not the most exciting MITB but it was a very good match. RVD wins MITB.I give this a 7 out of 10.

The third match was JBL vs. Chris Benoit for the United States Championship. It was a good match but the ending was crappy. JBL wins by cheating(as usual.)6 out of 10.

The fourth match was a Hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley. This is UNBELIEVABLE!!!!Barbwire,steel pans,and fire are what made Mick Foley great and this match is what made Mick Foley say Edge is the greatest wrestler in history. Oh and I forgot to mention THUMBTACKS!!!Edge wins. Unbelievable match 9 out of 10.

The fifth match was a Handicap match between Boogeyman vs. Booker T and his wife Sharmell. I really didn't care about this match. Boogeyman wins. 5 out of 10.

The sixth match is Mickie James vs. Trish Stratus for the Womens Championshp. One of the best womens matches ever. Mickie wins!6.2 out of 10.

The seventh Match is a Casket match between The Undertaker and Mark Henry. I like this match a lot.'Taker wins. 7 out of 10.

The eighth match is match of the year. Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. McMahon in a No Holds Barred match. HBK wins. 9 out of 10.

The ninth match is a Triple Threat match for the World Heavyweigt Championship. Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton. The Match should have been longer but they made every minute worth watching. Rey finally wins the big one. 8.5 out of 10.

The tenth match isn't even worth mentioning.

The eleventh match and the main event John Cena vs. Triple H for the WWE Championship. The entrances are great the match was overall great. John Cena wins.'The Champ is here!'9 out of 10.

You get all these matches plus the 2006 Hall of Fame Ceremony in its entirety AND you also get the emotional return of Saturday Nights Main Event in its entirety including a Street Fight between Shane McMahon and HBK which is a copy of the Montreal Screwjoband a beer drinking contest between Stone Cold and JBL.This is a must have!",1226188800,,2371,4.4004576659038905
2529237,5,B000EQ5PUA,"I have seen EVERY wrestlemania to date in its entirety, i have witnessed some serious flops for main events and undercard matches, AKA (EVERY john cena match) is mockable to say the least, and its credibility is usually saved by the opponent he has in the ring and that was definately the case with their main event square off in the main event. HOWEVER this card was powerful and had my eyes glued to the screen on more than one occasion. A DEFINATE MUST BUY!

Carlito & Chris Masters vs Kane & Big Show: Bad opener. Carlito is an amazing wrestler but putting him in the ring with Big Show and Kane, Two completely different atmospheres, put on a decent show but could have been definately saved for RAW. 5/10

 MONEY IN THE BANK!; Shelton Benjamin vs Ric Flair vs RVD vs Finlay vs Matt Hardy vs Lashley: This was ONE AMAZING match! From the opening bell it was instant action and high flying moves, and you even see Ric Flair fly high! All of these men are amazing performers and you see all of them in their element! amazing finish as it should be! 10/10

JBL vs Chris Benoit: Chris Benoit had been getting underjobs after he dropped the title after WM 20. He was a world champion and was deduced to a US Champion and then was screwed out of that title. very soon after he died, so you kinda wish he had better matches but he and JBL didn't mesh well and the match was very basic, not horrible but predictable and basic. wouldnt hurt to miss it. 4/10

Edge vs Mick Foley: Quite possibly the best match on the card. Mick Foley had never been a showstopper or a high flyer or the powerhouse, but that guy can take a beating and sell it better than anyone else, that night he and edge tore each other apart. a true hardcore match that saw some amazing things! you have to give it up to EDGE he really put himself on the line and cut himself up pretty bad and gave it all to the fans as Mick did. a true wrestlemania classic!

Mickie James vs Trish Stratus: I for one enjoyed this match alot. i never watch the womens matches on any card but i watched this one. besides the fact that mickie james and trish stratus are gorgeous and in provocative positions all match long, they did some high flying risk taking stuff! it was also cool to see the crows get so much into it, and the storyline going in was mickie james was the psychotic trish stratus stalker (heel) and trish was the typical hottie (face) but the crowd turns on stratus mid match and starts cheering for mickie! everytime startus hits a move the crowd boos like crazy. a good match but the ending sucked, really let me down. 7/10

Mark Henry vs Undertaker: Undertaker undefeated at WM, but Mark Henry? come on! hes been a jobber since 98"". and your going to pit him against teh undertaker at the grandest stage? not a good choice, extremely predicatable and very short Taker is a great wrestler and a great showman, but even taker couldn't save this one. 4/10

Shawn Michaels vs Mr McMahon: BEST MATCH ON THE CARD; ONE OF THE BEST WRESLTMANIA MATCHES EVER!! McMahon complimented Michaels so well in this match and vice versa. Vince took so much abuse from Shawn you almos felt bad for the demonic mcmahon..almost...lol this match really hit it on the herad what a wrestlemania match was supposed to carry as far as amazement and showcasing. Mcmahon is not a wrestler but he didn't need to be to steal the show with shawn. I loved it when shawn saluted the crowd with teh DX chop, the crowd went nuts i loved it, unbenounced to be Triple H would also do it later! and DX was reformed shortly after wrestlemania 22. One of the showstoppers best

Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio: This match delivered, however for me i never believed Rey Mysterio to be a main event guy, much less be a World Champion. He just doesnt get over that much for me. and to be put over so heavily at mania, kinda feels cheezy. the match did deliver in its short time span and they all deliver some pretty spectacular moves. Kurt was wrestling injured and i applaud his fortitude. a good match overalljust kinda wish to see more main event guys than Rey Mysterio. 7/10

John Cena vs. Triple H: (WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH)
I have always respected the Game as a face or a heel. he gives everything he has every match, not to say John Cena hasn't or doesnt work hard, i just felt that he was put over way too soon without earning his spot, like the greats did, Steve Austin, the Rock, Mick Foley, and of course Triple H. I think people are getting sick of Cena and his basic strategy. He has a mouthpiece and can talk but hes even derived from that tactic! anyway i digress. The main event at this years mania was good, but Triple H made it that way. he sold Cena so well throughout the match that it put both of them over. This stage really set the Game up for a face turn because there was no evolution anymore and it was just triple H so his effort was heartfelt by the fans. One of the Games best. 9/10",1222387200,,4949,4.329018338727076
2529238,5,B000EQ5PUA,"When you look at the card on paper you see Vince McMahon vs HBK, Mick Foley vs Edge Hardcore Match, Micki James vs Trish Stratus & Mark Henry vs Undertaker. You see this card and you expect to be disapointed but you're sorely wrong as these where the best matches on the card.
Here is a match by match review of the show in no particular order as i'm doing it from memory so bear with me.

Big Show & Kane vs Carlito vs Chris Masters.
3/5 This match had potential but it let me down the only real high point of the match was that Carlito was in it.

6 Man Money In The Bank Ladder Match. RVD vs Shelton vs Ric Flair vs Matt Hardy vs Finlay vs Lashley.
5/5 Amazing match and like always Ric, RVD & Shelton didn't let us down but the other 3 guys really were terrible in the match but it still deserves its 5 stars

Undertaker vs Mark Henry Casket Match.
3/5 very slow match that i honestly expected to be worse but Undertaker delivered a great Wrestlemania match as usual.

Boogeyman vs Booker T.
0/5 The worst match on the card, i am a big fan of Booker's and even he didn't deliver in this match which was a real disapointment in my book.

Mick Foley vs Edge Hardcore Match.
6/5 This was definately the show stealer and shows that Mick Foley is still the hardcore legend and it proved that Edge will still go to any lengths to capture the eyes of the fans.

Mickie James vs Trish Stratus Womens Championship.
5/5 Amazing match that also was one of the best matches on the card it was more the storytelling than the wrestling and Mickie had the crowd on her side to no surprise.

Vince McMahon vs Shawn Michaels Street Fight.
5/5 Incredible match that showed us the old Shawn Michaels and showed us why we love him and Vince really perfomed amazingly in this match.

Rey Mysterio vs Kurt Angle vs Randy Orton World Championship.
5/5 This match was waaaaaayyyyy too short but for the time that these 3 men where in the ring they seriously delivered an incredible match.

John Cena vs Triple H WWE Championship.
5/5 This was a great match and the atmosphere was incredible and i like most of the fans where 100% behind HHH winning but all in all this was an amazing match.

This was an incredible PPV and the best Wrestlemania since WM17 so i seriously recommend you check this out because it was worth the PPV price so it will really be worth the DVD price.",1214006400,,2356,4.274157303370787

This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Wrestlemania 22
This is one of my favorite events to watch. This DVD would have gotten 4 stars if it weren't for the amazing amount of extras on it. Although the event is generally good, it has its low and average points. I find the staging at this event to be superbly made. It really gives Wrestlemania 22 a good feel. The casing for this DVD is also great looking. WWE always does well with Wrestlemania's casing.

-Disc 1-
World Tag Team Championship
Big Show & Kane(c) VS Carlito & Chris Masters
This was an excellent choice for an opener to this event. There are some great comedy spots, high-flying spots, and power spots. This is one of the best normal tag matches I've ever seen.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match

United States Championship
Chris Benoit(c) VS JBL
The match was boring and not much happened in it. It is not terrible it is just average.
RATING- 5.5/10

Hardcore Match
Mick Foley VS Edge (Match of the DVD)
This is a masterpiece of a match. Mick Foley wanted a Wrestlemania moment and he's got one now. Barbwire, chairs, cookie sheets, stairs, and even fire all come into play in this match. Both men take a beating and after this match are bloody messes. Mick has had some great Hardcore matches with Triple H (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Royal-Rumble-2000/dp/B00004VVNN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Royal Rumble 2000</a>) and Randy Orton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Backlash-2004/dp/B0001OGVRG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Backlash 2004</a>) recently, but this match is the best out of all of them.

Boogeyman VS Booker T & Sharmell
The segments leading up to this match are funny and the match can be funny at times too. The problem is that this match took time away from other matches on the card.
RATING- 4/10

WWE Women's Championship Match
Trish Stratus(c) VS Mickie James
This match is one of the best women's matches in a very long time. The ending is messed up and that takes away from the match, but it is still excellent.
RATING- 8/10

Casket Match
Undertaker VS Mark Henry
The last 3 moves in this match are awesome. Everything else is boring and consists of punches mostly. The last three moves save this from being horrible though. Undertaker has had many better Wrestlemania matches, including against Triple H at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-X-Seven/dp/B00005KH1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania X-Seven</a>&nbsp;and against Ric Flair at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-X8/dp/B00005RIYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania X8</a>.

RATING- 6.5/10

No Holds Barred Match
Shawn Michaels VS Mr. McMahon
McMahon gets the crap beat out of him for almost the entire match. JR's commentary is great in this match. There are many cool spots and it really feels like HBK is evolving during the match. I like the fact that McMahon doesn't try to make himself equal to HBK like at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-WrestleMania-XIX/dp/B00008HCA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE WrestleMania XIX</a>&nbsp;where Hogan and McMahon are set as equal opponents.

2529242,5,B000EQ5PUA,"Since 2000, WWE has been on target with WrestleMaina. This years event featured alot of great moments to add to the list of WrestleMaina moments that people will never forget. The hardcore match between Foley and Edge was a sight to behold. I notice this PPV had alot of hardcore matches, something they should have kept up.

Carlito & Chris Masters vs Kane & Big Show: Bad opener. Its funny how Kane and Big Show were called the most dominant tag team in the history of the WWE. They didn't have tag teams back them to wrestle and the tag team division right now is still a joke.

Shelton Benjamin vs Ric Flair vs RVD vs Finlay vs Matt Hardy vs Lashley: Since 2000, WrestleMaina has always put in a ladder match because they know thats what people love. Money in the Bank has been the highlight of the past two Maina's and this is no expection. Short match with RVD winning.

JBL vs Chris Benoit: Good match but the ending was typical JBL.

Edge vs Mick Foley: This match stole the show.

Mickie James vs Trish Stratus: Skip

Mark Henry vs Undertaker: A decent match but it wasn't so great. Taker may have won 15 straight at WrestleMaina but some of the wins are over some pretty bad wrestlers.

Shawn Michaels vs Mr McMahon: After two dismal matches, this is anther gem. McMahon may not be the greatest wrestler but he always puts on his best show. An excellent match.

Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio: One of the best triple threats ive ever seen. Call me crazy but this match was really short and delivered in the time it was given. Awesome match. I hate to say it but since Eddie died, Rey seems to be getting a free pass. First winning the rumble and now the world title. Mysterio is a great wrestler but the way WWE packages world champions, he doesnt fit the bill.

Funny as I go down the list of matches and realizs alot of the wrestlers aren't in WWE anymore.

John Cena vs. Triple H: Amazing Triple H lost in the biggest main event of the year. Decent match but the Smackdown match was far better then this match.

Excellent dvd. Alot of quality matches but a few that could have been left on Raw. Its a shame that WWE didn't put out WrestleMaina 23 the same way as this set. This set included the whole Saturday Night's Main Event show and the Hall of Fame ceremony. Maybe they'll do it for 24.",1196294400,,2318,4.342592592592593
2529243,4,B000EQ5PUA,"This was a pretty entertaining dvd. HBK v.s. MacMahon, Mysterio v.s. Angle v.s. Orton, Edge v.s. Foley, HHH v.s. Cena, and The Money In The Bank matches were probly the best. But some weren't all that good. It might not be that memorable, but it was an awesome dvd.",1184630400,,265,4.428571428571429
2529244,5,B000EQ5PUA,"Since WCW died, WWE had progressively toned down their content to be less innovative and more formulaic. Why bust your ass to be the best if you're the only show in town?

Despite this terrible legacy, Wrestlemania 22 shocked me. Shocked. It was an event harkening back to those days in WWF when a series of foul missteps could have fans changing the channel to watch Nitro. Aside from a small few forgettable matches, the majority of this event was truly a surprise to a disillusioned smark like me.

World Tag Team Championship
The Big Show and Kane (C) vs Carlito and Chris Masters
This was an odd pairing for the challengers, and while they ultimately didn't work out, the match didn't exactly suffer as a result. This was one of those ""just there"" matches, obligatory to add some tag-team action to a 4 hour event. (5/10)

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
The only fault with this match was it was too short. Everyone was on edge in this match, and totally on. It was eight men all fighting at once in a ladder match, and while the WWE prefers not to have an all-out brawl occuring save in Royal Rumbles or Battle Royals, the one-on-ones went on with various superstars changing places so fluidly that you'd think everyone was out there fighting at once. There was never a slow point in this match which dragged it down, and even Ric Flair managed to make a few of the other superstars look good despite his inexperience in specialty matches. (10/10)

United States Championship
Chris Benoit vs John Bradshaw Layfield (C)
How far Benoit has fallen! Not meaning his tragic murder-suicide incident, I refer to how he was a great wrestler, main eventing Wrestlemania XX and winning the Heavyweight championship for the first time. Two years later, while untalented hacks like John Cena reach ""exalted"" status, Benoit is out jobbing to cowardly heels in mid-card matches. Little in this match looked very good, and it was a bad way for Benoit's career to wind up after a stunning Wrestlemania victory two years prior. (4/10)

Mick Foley vs Edge
This hardcore match was heavily hyped up beforehand, and so much so afterwards that Foley turned heel and faced off against his idol and Tommy Dreamer at ECW One Night Stand the next June. This wasn't the best hardcore match I've ever seen, but it was certainly an amazing and extreme match, climaxing with a spear by Edge to Foley through a flaming table. (10/10)

The Boogeyman vs Booker T and Sharmell
The fact that anyone tries to take this Boogeyman gimmick seriously is really sad for Smackdown and the WWE in general. The guy who plays Santino Morella currently had it right when he broke kayfabe in an OVW match by laughing at The Boogeyman. You'd have to laugh at him if the WWE didn't take it so seriously. He belongs among the ranks of Doink the Clown and Gobbledygooker. This match sucked. (0/10)

Women's Championship
Trish Stratus (C) vs Mickie James
This far into WWE's reign unopposed, you expect nothing from the Women's division but scantily clad women with implants catfighting in bra and panties. That match occurs later---THIS match was by far the best match I've seen two women in in years. These two were just ON this night, and it played out for an amazing match, which saw the fans turn against Trish and start cheering the heel--Mickie James. (9/10)

Casket Match
The Undertaker vs Mark Henry
Mark Henry is one of those aforementioned talentless hacks the WWE pushes to high-card status while ignoring the likes of Benoit and others. He's so fat and appalling a wrestler it's disgusting. The Undertaker has to make him look good, or as his previous gimmick said, ""make him famous"". The greatest point of the match is where Undertaker, a 6'10"", 320 pound man, ran across the ring, and leapt over the ropes at least 10 feet through the air onto Mark Henry, soaring over the heads of the referees holding the casket at the edge of the ring. Everything else was unremarkable. (6/10)

Shawn Michaels vs Vince McMahon
I think Shawn Michaels is a poor wrestler, and Vince McMahon isn't so much a wrestler as he is just a character that arouses the worst heel heat any heel could ever generate. But this match was little of a match than it was a brutal, extreme, and full of high spots. From McMahon dominating the early stages, to Michaels coming back at him, handcuffing Shane to the bottom rope, and leaping off a 20 foot ladder onto McMahon (with a garbage can over his head) through a table, this was a match that could almost rival the Foley vs Edge match earlier in the night. (10/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Kurt Angle (C) vs Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton
The last few Angle matches I've watched on DVD were major disappointments, and Mysterio in WWE is not the same Mysterio in ECW and WCW. And yet someone on the booking staff pulled the right moves, and this turned out to be the best wrestling match of the night. No hardcore or weapons, these three went at each other magnificently, in a match caliber that could only be second-rate because it was a Smackdown main event. And it was far better than the RAW main event. (10/10)

Playboy Pillow Fight
Torrie Wilson vs Candice Michelle
This is that awful Women's match I mentioned before. (0/10)

WWE Championship
Triple H vs John Cena (C)
This one astounded me, but ultimately disappointed. First off, each man had a unique entrance special for the occasion. Triple H's was magnificent, as he came out to ""King of Kings"" in a style much like Conan the Barbarian, complete with a massive sledgehammer prop beside his throne. My only gripe was that the song cut off and he went down to the ring to ""The Game"" instead. Cena's entrance was just awful. First we're treated to at least a five minute black and white ""idiot"" documentary about gangsters flourishing in the Great Depression, and how gangsters had ""hustle, loyalty, respect"". Then the most cliche' 1960s ""Batman""-esque music plays as a group of men (CM Punk included, pre-ECW) dressed as gangsters come out in a 1930s style car, giving their best ""Aaa, see? How you like that, see? I've got a gun, see?"" looks while waving fake Tommy guns around. Cena isn't even in the car, as he comes down the ramp with an equally fake gun, shooting it around while touting ""hustle, loyalty, respect"".

A less dismal main event you're not likely to find, and neither a more dismal one. Triple H is a brawler with lots of charisma, and Cena just plain can't wrestle. But the audience is what truly shocked me here. In shades of the ECW One Night Stand to come, much of the audience was against Cena, booing him as he traded punches with Triple H, and even a small portion of the audience chanting ""You can't wrestle!"" as Cena was ""wrestling"" Triple H. Only about half the audience was against Cena, but this half was undoubtedly the loudest. Other than that, the match was lackluster, and Cena's victory only cements his dismal legacy as the ""exalted"" one---similar to what Triple H had in 2000, where he is only main event status, would never drop the title for anyone save the rarest occasion, only to regain it soon after. Even worse is that Cena is not a wrestler, and his gimmick is truly terrible. (4/10)

Surprisingly, this was one of the greatest Wrestlemania's I've ever seen. Aside from a small portion of matches, including an awful main event (because Smackdown main events don't count) this was a sign of a totally un-WWE caliber pay per view. 9 out of 10.",1183939200,,7440,4.65220700152207

Carlito & Chris Masters vs Kane & Big Show:
A decent opener to the PPV. Not exactly something that will get the crowd off their feet, but a suitable match nontheless. A 7 minute match, and probably not the best choice for the opener.  6.5/10

2.(Money in the Bank Ladder Match)
Shelton Benjamin vs Ric Flair vs RVD vs Finlay vs Matt Hardy vs Lashley:
My personal choice for opener would have been MITB. The match is filled with non stop action, and a few high spots. The crowd really gets into it as well. The low point is the ending, with an unspectacular finish at the 12 minute mark. Short, but sweet.  7.5/10

A good match in all, but Chris Benoit could carry a broom to a good match. The ending came rather abruptly, but the rest of the match was quite good. Some nice back and forth action, holds, and crowd invlovement in a good match. Good, not great, and nothing memorable.  7/10

4.(Hardcore Match)
Edge vs Mick Foley:
Ya know how every Mania is supposed to have memorable and breathtaking matches? Unlike others before it, this is one of those matches. Great action, with Edge and Mick giving it their all. Even the ending is great. Match of the night.  9/10

5. Boogeyman vs Sharmell & Booker T:
Bad squash match. That's all that needs to be said here. Garbage. 3/10

6.(Women's Championship)
Mickie James vs Trish Stratus:
A surprisingly good match. But that isn't really saying much if you look at the division in general. Kept to a good lengh of 8 minutes, a surprisingly active crowd, and a Women's match that doesn't suck, which is rare.  6.5/10

7.(Casket Match)
Mark Henry vs Undertaker:
Well, it's a good and bad match. Bad, is the wrestling which is atrocious. But this isn't really a wrestling match, as much as a gimmick, created to entertain. And it's pretty entertaining. a bit slow paced, and dragged on a bit for 15 minutes, but it's okay.  6/10

8.(No Holds Barred Match)
Shawn Michaels vs Mr McMahon:
Basically, this was a squashing of Mr McMahon. But in a good way. The entertainment here is priceless, and the match is pretty good. Long at over 18 minutes, but it serves it's purpose. Mr McMahon in a garbage can. LOL.  8/10

9.(World Heavyweight Championship)
The first world title match of the night. While things start out good, with some nice triple threat stuff, things go downhill quick. At the 5 minute mark, guys are already doing finishers, so you know the match would be quick. It was short, 9 minutes! I can't help but feel if the match was given more time, it could've been very good. Too short, but still somewhat sweet.  7/10

10.(WWE Championship)
Triple H vs John Cena:
This match had the potential to be a classic. But.. it somehow disappointed me. I mean, the match is good and all, but it just didn't live up. The match was a total of 22 minutes, but didn't feel as long. The match had just started getting good, when it ended. Neither man broke a sweat. A really good match, but this is Wrestlemania people! This could've been amazing. It wasn't.  8/10

Overall this was a pretty good Wrestlemania. It wasn't as good as 21, but it was still a very good PPV. A few duds in between, a disappointing main event, and a lack of true Mania feel bring it down though. What can I say? It's WRESTLEMANIA!!

2529257,3,B000EQ5PUA,"Wrestlemania XX was bone-chilling, Wrestlemania XXI was great, but Wrestlemania XXII will soon be forgotten. But I have to praise it, since Wrestlemania is about the only thing WWE still has that feels like a pure PPV, and not like RAW XXL.

World Tag Team Championship

Kane & Big Show vs. Carlito & Chris Masters

After Carlito's and Masters' ridiculous push in the Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution, I didn't think that storyline would be developed any further. Thank god the two began to turn on each other at the end of this match. Just like any other match of the night, it didn't seem to pick up any momentum; not to mention the contestants aren't exactly famous for actually building momentum.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match- Ric Flair vs. Matt Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Finly vs. Bobby Lashley vs. RVD

This was your typical Ladder Match affair. Some entertaining spots, hairy ending and a somewhat predictable winner. I've got just one question: what is Ric Flair doing in this kind of match? I understand that WWE has more than enough absolute superstars, but before you stick them in a pity match, just so that they have their appearance at WM, leave them at home and let them be remembered in all their greatness.

United States Championship

Chris Benoit vs. JBL

Benoit, Benoit ...? I darkly remember him winning the World Title at WM XX, what the hell happened? I suspect Chris Benoit will be another Chris Jericho, and that's really a shame, especially when he has to wrestle someone like JBL. From winning the Championship at WM XX from Triple H to losing the US Title to JBL at WM XXII - that hurts. And it hurts even more when you realise Benoit may be always remembered as the almost-champion.

Women's Championship

Trish Startus vs. Mickie James

It's unbelievable, but this was one of the most entertaining matches of the night. The storyline is nice and engaging, and Mickie James is one hell of a charismatic girlie. Plus, it has the bonus of presenting Trish Stratus' last match as the Women's Champion. I still find the dual nature of the Women's Championship matches rather disturbing, though. They are just ""there"", sort of, half- serious, half- male entertainment.

Hardcore Match

Edge vs. Mick Foley

Alright, now here we have the first, and maybe only, truly great match of the night, with Mick Foley and Edge giving it all. Good intensity, and the ending with a burning table was spectacular. Not much more to say here - straight forward and great.

Booker T vs. The Boogeyman

Watching Booker T being scared by his own firework was pretty funny. That was good for about 5 seconds, the rest is garbage. But look at it this way: poor matches also have a tradition.

Casket Match- Undertaker vs. Mark Henry

Can't have a WM without Taker, can you? I really think WM needs him, but then please give him something worthwhile and better opponents! Mark Henry and Viscera, these two guys never should have come back, let alone face the Undertaker. Nothing good can come from it, and this match, I'm sorry, was just short, boring, slow, and piss poor.

Tombstone, lid closed, 14-0.

Erase it from your memory.

No Holds Barred- Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. McMahon

Hogan vs. Vince was great, Taker Vs. Vince was great, Flair Vs. Vince was great, Shawn Michaels Vs. Vince wasn't. The reason is simple: it was no match. The ""match"" only consisted of Shawn setting up things and eventually pulling off the big climax off the ladder. I'm not sure if it even had much entertainment value, since usually, Vince McMahon provides that value in his matches. But here, he just spends most of the time on his back. And without entertainment value, it's really just a bad wrestling match.

World Heavyweight Championship

Kurt Angle vs. Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio

Why Rey Misterio? Why? Hmmm ... ahem, why? It may remain Vince's secret. Has Rey Misterio the quality to shoulder World Wrestling Entertainment? Well, duh, apparently not. Does he have the physicality? For heaven's sake, we're talking about a guy who spent the heyday of his carreer as a cruiserweight champion! Obviously someone realised that and gave the title to Booker T not much later that year. Not a huge step forward, but at least he's got the looks.

And Randy Orton, the ""youngest world champion ... EVER"" (how many of those did we have already?) was just a filler anyway. At least it appeared that way.

Due to two World Championships being defended at Wrestlemania, you're never sure which title will change, so the match had at least some tension.

Squeezed in between was a pillow fight between two divas. I don't need to comment on that, do I?

WWE Championship

John Cena vs. Triple H

First time that the audience was on the proper side in a John Cena match. Didn't help much, though. As a Wrestlemania main event, it was slightly dissapointing (even more so since the rest wasn't that great, either), we've seen alot better in recent WM history, but Triple H, no matter who he's fighting, always delivers. And so in the end, Cena retaining the title was at least credible.

I don't know why this WM felt, and was, so sloppy and, quite frankly, without any fire. Apart from Edge vs. Foley, there was no match that held what it promised: the Triple Threat for the World Title was way too short, Cena vs. Triple H only lived from the atmosphere. Benoit didn't know what to do with JBL, Michaels vs. Vince was just padding along, and Mark Henry would ruin just about every match he's in anyway.

There's one good thing, though: I like how they incorporated the factor of insecurity about who will win world championship gold by having two Championships in one night. Wrestlemania was always one grand celebration for a new champion, but this new spin ... I find it refreshing.",1172707200,5,5791,4.7076313181367695

Kane & The Big Show Vs. Carlito & Chris Masters - Even though the two teams are made up of four singles wrestlers, this was seemingly a decent match. It certainly got the crowd going which an opening bout is suppose to do. Not a bad match at all but surely nothing special either. Big Show/Kane and Carlito/Masters has a decent Tag Team Title Match here. 3/5

Money In The Bank Ladder Match
Ric Flair Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Rob Van Dam Vs. Matt Hardy Vs. Finlay Vs. Bobbly Lashley - This year's MITB Match isn't better then WrestleMania 21's match but it still holds its own highlight reel and is still a good match. Just like the previous year, Shelton Benjamin once again stole the show while it showed RVD proving himself as a major title contender and Ric Flair having ""one last title run left in him"" which all added something to the match. 4.5/5

United States Championship
Chris Benoit Vs. J.B.L. - Not neccessarily the sleeper match of the night but morely the most under-rated match of the night. Nothing bad about this match, just isn't as good as previous matches between them. Still, this a very good U.S. Title Match. 4/5

Hardcore Match
Edge Vs. Mick Foley - This match was all about Mick Foley having his ""WrestleMania moment"" and he certainly had it here. This also has to be declared as one of the best Hardcore Matches in WWE history. Great spots involving the thumb tacks, barbed wire, and Edge spearing Mick Foley through the flaming table all are a must see. Match of the night. 5/5

Booker T & Sharmell Vs. The Boogeyman - After being given the shaft at last year's WrestleMania, Booker T was given this poor match at this year's WrestleMania against the Boogeyman. Horrible match that shouldn't have made it to the card. 1/5

WWE Women's Championship
Trish Stratus Vs. Mickie James - This has to be the best Women's Title Match in WrestleMania history. Throughout the course of the match, the fans totally turns on Trish and cheers for Mickie James. Great Women's Title Match. 4/5

Casket Match
Undertaker Vs. Mark Henry - It's obvious that Undertaker can bring his A game to WrestleMania so he had to give something special for everybody in this match because Mark Henry is worthless, no matter who he is in the ring with. Two spots to check out in this match are Undertaker diving over the casket and Tombstoning Mark Henry for the win. For what it's worth, this match is worth a view. 3/5

No Holds Barred Match
Shawn Michaels Vs. Mr. McMahon - Unlike the previous year with Kurt Angle, this match is not a Shawn Michaels 5 star classic wrestling match. This match is basically Shawn Michaels beating on Mr. McMahon every way possible with cameo appearences from the Spirit Squad and Shane McMahon. Again, for what it's worth this is an enjoyable good match. 4/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Kurt Angle Vs. Rey Mysterio Vs. Randy Orton - Like Smackdown's previous World Title Match at WrestleMania 21, this match barely goes over the 8 minute mark. Kurt Angle dominates the entire match until he is knocked out of the ring and Rey Mysterio pins Randy Orton for his first World Title win. Honestly, this match deserved more then what it recieved. 2.75/5

Lingerie Pillow Fight
Torrie Wilson Vs. Candice Michelle - The T&A segment of the night and honestly, this match has no reason to it. We already seen both of these two naked in Playboy so whats the point of seeing them in their bra and panties once again. 0.5/5

WWE Championship
John Cena Vs. Triple H - Besides Triple H's ""Conan The Barbarian"" and John Cena's ""Mobster"" entrances, this match was better then what anybody expected it to be. The crowd was the most vocal in this match and giving Cena so much heat. The match went well as it delivered more then what the people expected it to give. It ends with with the unthinkable as HHH taps out to John Cena's STFU. Overall, this is a good WWE Title main event with the Chicago crowd making it more then what it's worth. 4.5/5

Overall, this is a decent WrestleMania event. If you can get over some of the useless matches and skits throughout this event, I recommend to get this WrestleMania.",1169164800,3,4158,4.605405405405405

Match 1 -  Rey's Mysterio Team vs Chavo Guerrero's Team.
  10 Man Tag Team Elimination Match
  Loser has to QUIT the WWE and WINNER earns respect of Eddie Guerrero
Rey's Team ( Rey Mysterio, Brian Kendircks, Paul London, Bobby Lashley & Super Crazy.)
Chavo's Team ( Chavo Guerrero, The Pitbulls, Mr Kennedy, Fit Finaly & Gregory Helms.)

I think that they would have had this at survivor series, but there was no space on the roster, so they forwarded onto Wrestlemania 23. I expect a very quick pace as there are a lot of cruiserweights. I think after 10min it will come down to Rey vs Chavo, I think Rey would win after a further 3-4 min. I think this will be better than having an open cruiserweight invitation.
Winner : Rey Mysterio's Team ( 14min) Rating 8/10

Match 2 - Kane vs Umaga ( Intercontinental Title )
I think this match will also be a quick match, I think Umaga will win because they are trying to give him a big push for after wrestlemania. I think Big Show will come out to help kane, but to no prevail. I personally don't think this is going to be a good match. I expect a match like Kane vs Big Show ( Backlash 2006 ). Could even be a card filler.
Winner Umaga ( 7-8min) Rating 5/10

Some Performance by some band.

Match 3- The Hardy's vs Edge & Christian(RETURN) vs Nitro & Carlito ( w/ Melina and Trish Stratus ) TLC match for the WWE Undisputed Tag Title.
I think there is going to be 2 sets of titles up above , one in the ring and one by the entrance of where the superstars come in. I expect a normal TLC match like Summerslam 2000 or Wrestlemania 17. I think The Hardy's will get the SMACKDOWN Title and Then Edge & Christan  will get the RAW titles, I think there will be big falls from most competitors.
Winner : Hardy's and Edge & Christain ( 15 - 20 min GOOD LONG MATCH )
Rating 10/10

There will be some lingerie contest between Smackdown divas, like Wrestlemania 19.

Match 4 - Mick Foley vs Vince McMahon & shane McMahon ( NO DQ )
Expect a match like last years wrestlemania or Backlash 2004. I think that Shane and Mick Foley will be on the Top of the Arena, then I expect Mick to Push Shane off the Top and then Vince Push Mick off the top of the Areana, then Vince will come down and pick up the win. I expect a very bloody match, expect Vince to bleed like Survivor Series 2003.
Winner : Vince and Shane McMahon ( 14 min ) Rating 9.5/10

Match 5 - Stone Cold Steve Austin  vs Hulk Hogan
I do not expect a very good wrestling match but I think we will see I couple of Legends coming into the frame, such as Piper and Bob Orton. Expect a match like Wreslemania 18, I think the crowd will be right into this match. At the end I expect them  to hug , I think this will be the last time we see Hogan.
Winner : Hulk Hogan ( 10 min ) Rating 8/10

Hall of fame Inductees.

The Rock Returns and says he will come back to the WWE.

Match 6 - Batistia vs King Booker vs Kurt Angle vs Undertaker vs Khali vs Benoit ( Elimination Chamber.)
I think this could be like Summerslam 2003 as I think people will enter every 3 minutes, When Khali comes in, I think everyone will try to eliminate Khali, I then expect people like  Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit and King Booker to get eliminated very quickly, this will happen in 15 min, Then Undertaker and Batistia will go on for 10 min straight in a physical match, I think Undertaker will win and make it 15-0 at Wrestlemania
Winner : Undertaker ( 25 min ) Rating  9/10

Eric Bischoff comes back in and says he is becoming the new RAW General Manager.

Match 7 - Fatal 4 way 60 min Iron man Match
Shawn Michael's vs HHH vs. Randy Orton vs John Cena.
The Rule I think will be if you get DQ then you will lose a point, you can get a point form submission or pinfall, then the 1ast 15 min will change to be NO DQ anything goes. I think HHH and Orton will start fighting well the others are not even in the ring, expect HHH to pedigree Orton on the Commentators Table. Then will get stretcher out of the arena. After 45 min  Randy Orton comes back in, and RKO's everyone and picks up three points in 3 minutes. I think at the end of it all the points will look the following.
Shawn Michaels - 4 , HHH - 6 , John Cena - 3 , Randy Orton - 6
Then they will go into over time and it will turn into an one on one no dq match between Orton and HHH, Then Orton will hit three RKO's in a row, on HHH but Triple H will still kick out, then Orton will hit HHH with a chair then RKO him through a table for the Win. I expect the overtime to last about 10 - 12 min almost like a full match.
I expect Orton and HHH to  bleeding
Winner Orton ( 72 min ) Rating 220/10

big show & kane vs carlito & chris masters

when i was watching this match i couldn't belive what an awsome team big show and kane made they could overpower everyone. but carlitos cockiness could of payed off if the plan that him and chris masters tried would of worked but it didn't and i got to see chris masters get beat up which i thourght was a godd element to this match  7/10

this mactch was really incredible well just imagin the athleticisim of shelton benjamin then ric flairs dirty fighting style rvds hig flying abilitys finlays unique wrestling style matt hardys ladder match history and lashleys stength all in one match what more could you want??? but i do think that rvd shouldn't of won just beacuse i thourght shelton was better in that match 9/10

united states championship:

chris benoit vs jbl

i really like benoit and as a fan of his i was looking forward to him hopefully beating jbl up and winning but it was not to be as jbl won and won the united states championship  7/10

hardcore match:

edge vs mick foley

this match had so many twists i couldn't keep up. it made the match in a way a once in a lifetime match. just watching its brutality is enough. watching mick foley get speared through a burning tabel i was in shock of the extreamness in this match.

9.5/10

boogeyman vs booker t abd sharmell:

i really didn't like this match as a matter of fact i hated it. it was pointless and they could of used the time taken in this match to make other matches better and longer 1/10

womans championship match:

trish stratus vs mickie james

i have to admit i was not looking forward to this match because most womans matches are pointless and the womans wrestlers seem useless in the ring but when i watched this match i was really into it . it was the best womans match in history i think. mickie james when pycho most of the time but it made mickie seem like she was in controle of the match all the way through and she beat trish with trishes own move.  7/10

casket match:

undertaker vs mark henry

i was looking forward to seeing undertaker in this match but not mark henry as i think mark henry has maby injured more people than he has beat.but this match was alright and seeing the undertaker close that casket with mark henry inside reminded me why he is a legend. 7.5/10

no holds barred match:

vince mcmahon vs shawn michaels

i was looking forward to this match because i really wanted to see shawn michaels beat up vince and i wanted to see the side to shawn michaels i had hardly ever seen were he goes mad and risks everything thats why he is so good. this match was really funny as vince had the cover of the magazine he was in blown up and then he had it rapped round his head. later on in the match shawn put vince on a tabel climed up  a ladder then got off. i was shocked as i wanted to see him jump and put vince through the tabel. he went outside the ring picked up a bin put it over vinces head, got and even BIGGER LADDER and climed up it. then he jumped onto vince and put him through the tabel with a steel bin on his head.  9/10

world heavyweight championship:

kurt angle vs randy orton vs rey mysterio

 i was looking forward to this match and i wasn't dissapointed.

before wrestlemania i was a little annoyed at randy orton because he beat rey by cheating.... but then i remember how eddie gurrero lied CHEATED and stole  and i throurght that was  a little weird. but then rey got added to the match and i was so happy becasue he said he wanted to win the match for the late and great eddie gurrero (r.i.p) and the match was great but when that 619 hit the crowd knew it was over REY WON THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP even though he is a cruiserweight well done rey.  9/10

Triple H (c) vs. Edge

- Mick Foley will be the special referee for this match. Edge will lose the WWE Championship at Unforgiven to Randy Orton. Triple H will then defeat Orton at Survivor Series to become an 11-time world champion. While Triple H is feuding with Orton, Edge will be feuding Ric Flair. Edge will end up dumping Lita after she costs him a match. At the Royal Rumble, Edge will come up short and a Smackdown star will win it. At the ''Road to Wrestlemania'' tournament, Edge will beat Ric Flair, John Cena, and then Shawn Michaels to earn a WWE Championship Match at Wrestlemania. Edge and Triple H will then kick off an intense rivalry. During the contact signing Triple H will say he that could beat Edge in any match.

2529355,2,B000EQ5PUA,I tell you what that intro with HGH and Cena was the chessiest thing I have seen in a while. Its getting worse and worse. I was at Wrestlemania 17 in Houston now that was a Wrestlemania. I was happy Mickie won. There were many weak matches. The best thing was when Cena got booed out of the building. That was great! Over all this Wrestlemania instead of big time Big dissapointment.,1154131200,,383,4.333333333333333

Chicago, IL

Match #1 - WWE World Tag Team Championship - Kane & Big Show vs. Carlito & Chris Masters

-Nice opener, but Show and Kane really dominated throughout most of the match. The crowd was really into it, and in fact, you could really hear a lot of support for Carlito. The end of the match, with Masters and Carlito angry at each other, obviously leads you to believe that Carlito will become a ""babyface.""

RATING: 7/10

Match #2 - Money in the Bank Ladder Match - Ric Flair vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Matt Hardy vs. Finlay vs. Bobby Lashley

-Just like last year, this was an awesome match, really elevating the use of a ladder match. For 57 years old, Flair was excellent, and it was even better because you had diferent styles involved: Lashley is a big strong man, RVD is a high flyer, Benjamin is very versatile, etc. All-around excitement here.

RATING: 9.5/10

Match #3 - U.S. Championship - Chris Benoit vs. JBL

-Not a bad match, especially since you have Benoit involved. But, JBL grabs the title.

RATING: 6/10

Match #4 - Hardcore Match - Mick Foley vs. Edge

-Unbelievable! Arguably the most brutal, violent match in Wrestlemania history. You have to give Mick credit; he can still take all of that brutality. Edge showed that his experience in TLC matches was an advantage. The spear through the fire-lit table will be the most memorable part of this contest, even if Joey Styles sounded like he was dying.

RATING: 9.5/10

Match #5 - Boogeyman vs. Booker T & Sharmell

-As if there was ever a doubt about this one. Not much of a match; overshadowed by the gimmick of Boogeyman.

RATING: 5/10

Match #6 - WWE Women's Championship - Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James

-For a women's match, this was excellent. Moves were executed nicely, and the most important part: the crowd enjoyed it outside of just looking at the women. There was a huge support for Mickie, and I think she really deserves to be champion.

RATING: 7.5/10

Match #7 - Casket Match - Undertaker vs. Mark Henry

-Now we all know that there was no way Mark Henry would be the one to stop the Undertaker's streak, but they did put together a decent match. 'Taker will always be the man.

RATING: 7/10

Match #8 - No Holds Barred - Shawn Michaels vs. Vince McMahon

-Great match, but more for excitement and entertainment than for the moves involved. Shane getting invloved was a plus, and Shawn's elbow drop from the 20 ft ladder was awesome. Great job.

RATING: 8.5/10

Match #9 - World Heavyweight Championship - Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton

-Pretty good, but too short. I knew Rey would win, but I just don't see him as a Heavyweight champion. Kurt was great as usual, and Randy did OK. But, it left a lot to be desired.

RATING: 7/10

Match #10 - Playboy Pillow Fight - Torrie Wilson vs. Candice Michelle

-This wasn't a match at all, just really time to kill before the last match. The only good part of all of this was seeing them with little on, but I've seen that so many times without much wrestling and it can get redundant.

RATING: 2/10

Match #11 - WWE Championship - John Cena vs. Triple H

-I was really hoping that the Game would end Cena's dopey reign, but it was not to be. Still, it was an exciting match. It went back and forth numerous times, and the ending was filled with uncertainty and excitement. All in all, a great main event.

RATING: 9/10

Overall, this was an excellent Wrestlemania, definitely one of the better ones. In addition the that, though, you get the return of Saturday Night's Main Event in its entirety, AND the Hall of Fame ceremony in its entirety. Plus, you get to see the 2nd annual inter-promotional battle royal from before Wrestlemania, which is worth a look.

There is so much to look forward to on this 3-disc set, and it's definitely worth the price. Strongly recommended!",1153872000,,3862,4.530346820809249

2529410,4,B000EQ5PUA,"WrestleMania 21 was so good that the expectations were so high for the following year's event. But it just wasn't happening. But, after watching the program a couple of times, I realized that WrestleMania 22 wasn't so bad after all. The tag team match and the Money in the Bank match were yawns (even though Shelton Benjamin and Rob Van Dam were great), Bret Hart declined to be part of the Hall of Fame portion and my boy Booker T got squashed by The Boogeyman. But other than those flaws, the rest of the program is very entertaining.

Chris Benoit and JBL have a predicable but entertaining match for the US Title, with JBL two-stepping his way to a victory (a jaded one, of course). Trish Stratus and Mickie James have one of the better women's matches in some time, despite a botched finish that somebody edited out of the final cut (boo!). Undertaker increases his WrestleMania streak to 14-0, of course. It was disappointing to see him in possibly his last WM against Mark Henry, but oh well. I officially became a Shawn Michaels fan with the beating he gave Mr. McMahon, and Edge and Mick Foley have a brutal hardcore match as well (watch the end of this one). Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle provide a little TNA to keep the perverts entertained to round out the undercard.

The Triple Threat Heavyweight Title match was a breathtaking match. Even though it was short, there was never a dull moment and the ending was a little too predictable, with Rey Mysterio taking the title. I have no problem with Rey taking the throne but this match would have been better if it was just Angle vs. Orton. It's a shame that WWE used Eddie Guerrero's death to boost the career of Rey Mysterio to championship status. It's wrong that they had to do that. Nonetheless, a fun and entertaining match.

But business picked up in the WWE Title match between John Cena and Triple H in their first ever meeting. The crowd was SO in to this match that it was incredible. It was a very exciting match and better than a lot of people expected it to be. Definitely a classic showdown between good and evil. But of course when Triple H is in the main event, good things are going to happen. That's why he's been there a good four, five times.

WrestleMania 22 is really better than it gets credit for. It just couldn't live up to its predecessor. Fortunately, the DVD is crammed with loads of extras, including the Saturday Night's Main Event telecast from two weeks before WrestleMania, in its entirety. It'd be nice to see more whole telecasts on DVD releases in the future. The bottom line: a solid WrestleMania, could've been better (with better inter-promotional matches and an appearance by Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold or The Rock), but great action nonetheless.",1149724800,8,2750,4.617586912065439
2529411,5,B000EQ5PUA,"When you look at the card on paper you see Vince McMahon vs HBK, Mick Foley vs Edge Hardcore Match, Micki James vs Trish Stratus & Mark Henry vs Undertaker. You see this card and you expect to be disapointed but you're sorely wrong as these where the best matches on the card.

Here is a match by match review of the show in no particular order as i'm doing it from memory so bear with me.

Big Show & Kane vs Carlito vs Chris Masters.

3/5 This match had potential but it let me down the only real high point of the match was that Carlito was in it.

6 Man Money In The Bank Ladder Match. RVD vs Shelton vs Ric Flair vs Matt Hardy vs Finlay vs Lashley.

5/5 Amazing match and like always Ric, RVD & Shelton didn't let us down but the other 3 guys really were terrible in the match but it still deserves its 5 stars

Undertaker vs Mark Henry Casket Match.

3/5 very slow match that i honestly expected to be worse but Undertaker delivered a great Wrestlemania match as usual.

Boogeyman vs Booker T.

0/5 The worst match on the card, i am a big fan of Booker's and even he didn't deliver in this match which was a real disapointment in my book.

Mick Foley vs Edge Hardcore Match.

6/5 This was definately the show stealer and shows that Mick Foley is still the hardcore legend and it proved that Edge will still go to any lengths to capture the eyes of the fans.

Mickie James vs Trish Stratus Womens Championship.

5/5 Amazing match that also was one of the best matches on the card it was more the storytelling than the wrestling and Mickie had the crowd on her side to no surprise.

Vince McMahon vs Shawn Michaels Street Fight.

5/5 Incredible match that showed us the old Shawn Michaels and showed us why we love him and Vince really perfomed amazingly in this match.

Rey Mysterio vs Kurt Angle vs Randy Orton World Championship.

5/5 This match was waaaaaayyyyy too short but for the time that these 3 men where in the ring they seriously delivered an incredible match.

John Cena vs Triple H WWE Championship.

5/5 This was a great match and the atmosphere was incredible and i like most of the fans where 100% behind HHH winning but all in all this was an amazing match.

This was an incredible PPV and the best Wrestlemania since WM17 so i seriously recommend you check this out because it was worth the PPV price so it will really be worth the DVD price.",1149724800,6,2366,4.274157303370787

WrestleMania returns to Chicago for the third time in history under the theme of ""Big Time.""  A couple of notes here in that Michelle Williams from Destiny's Child sang the National Anthem & Jim Ross replaced Joey Styles as RAW lead commentator for the event with the exception of Styles calling the hardcore match later on in the show.

World Tag Team Champions Big Show & Kane vs. Carlito & Chris Masters - Kane & Show dominated early on with moves like Show easily tossing Carlito over the top rope onto Masters followed by Kane coming off the top rope onto both men with Carlito & Masters only gaining an advantage due to a mistimed move by show but it didn't last long with Kane & Show once again recovering & taking advantage of the miscalculation by Carlito & Masters.  This was pretty much a dominate showcase of Show & Kane as Carlito & Masters were never able to get a series of momentum throughout the match.

Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair vs. Matt Hardy vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Finlay vs. Shelton Benjamin - This match started off as a 6 way brawl between everyone & didn't stop with various highlights such as RVD's over the top dive onto Hardy & the ladder, Shelton using the ladder as a ramp for the running senton to the outside, Hardy's high suplex off the ladder, RVD's hard landing on the ladder after the Rolling Thunder, a triple powerbomb off the ladder, the showdown between veterans Flair & Finlay, Lashley showcasing his power, RVD's top rope dropkick with the chair, Hardy with a legdrop & side effect off the ladder, RVD's 5 Star Frog Splash off the ladder, and Shelton's showcase of athleticism throughout the match. The bar was pretty set high after the first one the previous year but they were able to match it here.
[Straight To The Top: Money In The Bank Anthology]

U.S. Champion Chris Benoit vs. J.B.L. - Both men started out trading fist before Benoit took him down with grounded wrestling & headbutts but J.B.L. was able to counter with a side headlock only for Benoit to reverse again pounding on his neck & head causing Jillian Hall to be used as a distraction for J.B.L. to land his own punches & kicks to the head as the match started to pick up with both men working over each other's heads such as Benoit's german suplexes & J.B.L.'s nerve hold & side chinlock while also getting very arrogant mocking Eddie Guerrero & his 3 amigos suplexes only for Benoit to perform his own version & countering J.B.L.'s own clothesline from hell into the crossface.  J.B.L. has mostly been known as a brawler but this was a match where Benoit brought out the best in him as far as straight wrestling with both men telling a story of working over the head & neck for this specific signature moves.

Hardcore Match: Mick Foley vs. Edge - Edge went on the offense right away using a cookie sheet & even executing a baseball slide into a road sign but it was when he attempted a spear that for some reason hurt himself more than Foley & causing his shoulder to bleed in the process as he revealed a strand of barbed wire wrapped around his waist underneath his flannel shirt. Foley continued to whip Edge across his bare back with the wire with Lita getting involved only for Foley to do his famous Cactus clothesline over the top rope with Lita on his back going over as well. They started to brawl on the outside with Foley thrown into the steps more than once & head whipped back onto the ramp before Foley own weapon of ""Barbie"" was used against him. Edge ended up taking more punishment of his own when he took a drop onto thumbtacks, a barbed wire ""Mr. Socko"" that Lita even felt the effects of, and ""Barbie"" resulting in Edge bleeding before he was able to give a spear to Foley that resulted in not only such a visual but also Mick Foley finally getting his ""WrestleMania Moment.""

[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses: Hardcore Edition; Edge: Decade Of Decadance; OMG: Top 50 Incidents]

Boogeyman vs. Booker T & Sharmell - We got a funny skit before the match with the freaks of wrestling from the past & present confronting Booker T but this was nothing past Boogeyman's usual act of eating words & freaking out his opponents with it which in this case was kissing Sharmell with a mouth full of worms in a match that was very short to the point where the backstage skit was more entertaining than anything that happened here.

Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James - Mickie game out the gate with a slap to with Trish responding with a Thesz Press takedown followed by punches & chops & a kick to the head only for Mickie to take advantage of a missed move to heavily work over Trish's leg using the ringpost & submissions like a half crab but Trish was starting to mount a comeback taking Mickie down many times with either a head scissors or clothesline or spinebuster & later a counter into a running powerbomb before Mickie still went after the leg & even using Trish's own moves against her like the head scissors & Chick Kick.  These two girls delivered a strong match with the ""bizarro world"" Chicago crowd playing a huge role & they chose their favorite & make it clear.

Casket Match: Undertaker vs. Mark Henry - Another Mania first in that this was the first casket match at the event. In a nutshell, Mark Henry was another limited big man so the match was a slow paced brawl as this was one of those cases where the stipulation definitely helped more than it would have been if they had a regular match. Nothing special here past the fact that this was the first casket match at Mania.
WrestleMania 22
[Undertaker 15-0; Undertaker: The Streak]

No Holds Barred Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. McMahon - Vince came into his match with an unbelievable tan (he looked like an Umpa Lumpa on steroids) showing off a portait of his ""Muscle & Fitness"" magazine cover at ringside before Shawn went right after him using the announce table & the equipment on it to his advantage along with the magazine cover not only resulting in Vince getting cut over his eye but also forcing him to call help in the Spirit Squad allowing Vince to take brief control whipping Shawn & having Shane get involved using a kendo stick only for Shawn to return it right back not only using the kendo stick on Vince & a handcuffed Shane but also put a new member into the ""Kiss My Ass Club"" as Shawn started to get more calculated & more violent with his actions going back to his past as a ""degenerate"" against Vince such as a loud direct chairshot & ladder to bust him open, using a table & trash can & a pulling out the highest ladder I've seen in WWE to land on Vince with impact, and making sure Vince saw Sweet Chin Music coming directly at his face.  This match wasn't the wrestling classic that Shawn has been known to deliver as ""Mr. WrestleMania"" as it wasn't designed to be that way more than just him being pushed to show off a very aggressive & violent side of him that we haven't seen in years while also having all the actions done to him for months by Vince come back to haunt him so in that light, this was a very entertaining match.

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton - P.O.D. performed Rey Mysterio to the ring as Orton attacked Kurt with the belt right from the start with Angle responding with not only a german suplex on Orton but another one on him & Mysterio at the same time before giving an assist to Rey lifting him up in the air for a top rope frankensteiner allowing Rey to take control as he was able to roll through a sunset flip attempt into a knockout kick followed by a head scissor takeover however Angle was able to counter an attempted 6-1-9 attempt into the anklelock & later catching Orton in the anklelock with the referee distracted both times as he kept deliver impactful german suplexes & an Angle Slam that sent one challenger over the top rope only for each man to come back with a big move from Orton's RKO to Angle's top rope belly to belly suplex & Rey delivering a 6-1-9 around the ring post before it came down to come man being able to ""divide & conquer"" long enough to get the victory.  This was what a triple threat was designed to be in that it was non-stop action from all three men delivering one big move after another with each man looking like they had a chance but the major downfall of this (depending on how you want to look at it) is that this match was under 10 minutes when you would expect more from a World Championship match at WrestleMania.

Pillow Fight Match: Torrie Wilson vs. Candice Michelle - Former tag partners & Playboy cover girls met here with both girls wearing evening gowns while the ring was decorated with a bed & pillows in the center of the ring as Torrie actually executed some offense on Candice such a suplex, a backdrop onto the bed before turning it over & stomped on her on top of the mattress, and actually having her pet dog deliver the stinkface while Candice tried to choke her with a leg scissors across her head while she hung over the top rope.  This was what you would expect from these two as it was just an excuse to promote the WWE Playboy issue for the month (do any significant amount of people really order WrestleMania just to see the Playboy cover girl that they already see naked in the magazine?) with the girls eventually stripping down to their bra & panties with the only significant thing I noticed is that for what was advertised as a pillow fight, not one pillow was used.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Triple H - This match was similar to how the Hogan/Rock match at WrestleMania X8 was in that WWE had this match setup for one guy to be the babyface & the other the heel but the fans decided otherwise. It was during this period that John Cena was receiving a heavy amount of backlash by the fans as WWE Champion despite how much WWE was trying to force the audience to cheer for him (his previous Kurt Angle feud is a perfect example of that) which resulted in Triple H (who's no stranger to the audience disliking him for being shoved down their throats) being the lesser of two evils to the audience & came into this match as the fan favorite. As eluded to in the weeks building up to this event, Triple H took Cena very lightly & kept showing him up throughout the match...which would eventually come back to bite him as not only did the match end with the result that some people didn't expect but how it ended was in a way that even more people didn't expect. As a side note, pay attention to the ring entrances during this match as both of them came off as ""did they really think that would get over"" moments while if you pay close attention during Cena's entrance...you'll see a ""Straight Edge"" Chicago mobster.
[True Story Of WrestleMania]

(Bonus) RAW vs. SmackDown Battle Royal - This was the typical battle royal that only had a few standout moments such as ""My Name Is Simon Dean"", the noticeable dominance of Trevor Murdock, Viscera's treatment of MNM, and the crowd getting behind Chicago's own Road Warrior Animal.

Saturday Night's Main Event:
John Cena & Triple H vs. Kurt Angle, Rey Mysterio, Randy Orton - This was set to be a history making tag team match it's the first time that the WWE Champion teamed with his WrestleMania challenger to face the World Champion & his WrestleMania challengers (which WWE forgot about a year later when trying to advertise the No Way Out main event under the same conditions) as Angle & Rey some teamwork with Angle executing his suplexes on Cena & Triple H followed by Rey going high risk with the seated senton & taking both men with back to back dropkicks while Triple H did save Cena from an attempted 6-1-9 but caused tension with his partner when he got very aggressive with Rey on the outside tossing him into the barricade to the point where Cena refused to tag in out of protest before eventually tagging in to work over Orton but the tensions boiled over with one man turning on the other which Orton tried to take advantage of only for his teammates to make it clear they weren't going to accept the win like that.  This was an entertaining tag match perfectly telling the stories between not only the opponents but the uneasy alliance with the partners as well.

Trish Stratus & Mickie James vs. Victoria & Candice Michelle - This match was pretty much short & quick to the point where one of the participants was never even tagged into the match but this was more about what happened afterwords when Mickie James got emotional over how Trish reacted to her ""farewell.""

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Shane McMahon - Shawn started out attacking Shane from behind on the ramp down to ringside where he was able to reverse whip Shawn into the ring post before setting up a ladder in the ring while Vince setup a table on the outside only for both men to come off the ladder & crash through the table but Shane was able to recover using the ladder as a weapon against Shawn's back & delievering a chairshot with Vince getting involved whenever possible using a kendo stick against Shawn & causing distractions in favor of Shane but also ended up getting involved one too many times where it backfired when Shane went for the ""Coast To Coast"" with a trash can allowing Shawn to come back with his trademark maneuvers only for Vince to once again get Shawn to focus on him allowing Shane to take advantage & have a case of ""deja vu"" occur when he had Shawn in a certain submission hold.  This was a fun match.
[Best Of Saturday Night's Main Event]

Also on here was a Beer Drinking Contest between Steve Austin & J.B.L., Edge & Lita hosting ""The Cutting Edge"" with Mick Foley as the special guest, and Mark Henry calling out Undertaker.

The third disc is the entire Hall Of Fame ceremony honoring Bret Hart, Eddie Guerrero, Gene Okerland, Tony Atlas, William Perry, Verne Gagne, The Blackjacks, and Sensational Sherri. Other extras include backstage footage of Mick Foley getting stitches after his match, the World Champion's celebration, the complete post show, Cena addressing the fans the next night after RAW, a look at WrestleMania week in Chicago, and vignettes leading into the Edge/Foley & Triple H/Cena matches.

Again, the event itself wasn't a top level ""classic"" WrestleMania but did have some standout matches (Money In The Bank, Edge/Foley, Trish/Mickie, HBK/Vince) along with extras making up for whatever was lacking during the event so I recommend.",1148688000,10,14505,4.5028506271379705
2529415,4,B000EQ5PUA,"It's unforunate to note that there were no real standout WrestleMania clinics at WrestleMania 22. The match that came closest to being a classic was, in my opinion, the hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley (and if only for its sheer brutality). If you want an idea of how sick some of the spots were in this match, imagine Mick's Royal Rumble 2000 match with Triple H but multiply its shock factor by five. There is a flaming table spot at the end that will shock most spectators. This is nothing compared to what ECW and Japanese audiences have seen, but to the everyday watered-down and sheltered WWE fan, this match is a sight to behold. I have to give Edge his props; he's definitely paid his dues. Now hand the man a world title for more than two weeks!

As I said, there were no classic bouts on this year's card, but that doesn't mean the event wasn't memorable. The majority of the matches -- save about two -- were actually pretty decent. The ""money in the bank"" six-man ladder match upped the ante for the second year in a row. The women's title match was a pleasant surprise. Mickie James is a worthy champion, to be sure. Apparently there was a botched move toward the end of the match, but the DVD I bought has it edited out. The Boogeyman segment (I won't even call it a match for sake of insulting the wrestling business) was a complete waste of time. Booker T deserves so much better. Both championship matches were lacking, I think. Neither of them were bad, or even mediocre, but they just weren't as great as past championship matches at Wrestlemania. The entrances to Cena and Triple H were emberassing as well. I loved seeing the crowd eat away at Cena, though.

Undertaker/Henry was another waste of time, but it was good that Undertaker's streak wasn't killed by the talentless waste of strength that is Mark Henry. I won't even get into the lingerie pillow fight match (I don't even remember seeing pillows involved, now that I think of it). The most overrated match on the card was definitely the McMahon/Michaels street fight. I couldn't find anything really positive about the match, aside from the fact that the chairman of the board was getting his ass kicked.

Overall: 7/10 (rounded up to 4/5 stars)

Another thing I'd like to mention is the third disc of the DVD set. On it is the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony. If you're into wrestling enough, this induction ceremony is more than worth the cost of WrestleMania. It's not quite as interesting as last years, but the induction of Bret Hart is a sight to behold. Hart shares a handful of stories that will get you laughing, many of them regarding his brother, the late great Owen Hart.",1148688000,,2668,4.552083333333333
2529416,3,B000EQ5PUA,"I would give it four stars, but the WWE cheated the fans, and edited some of the Mickie/ Trish Match, and all the deserved negative chants to the pathetic John Cena.  As for the DVD Set, it is simply great. The wrestlemania show alone was slightly above average with the best matches being Edge Vs. Foley and Shawn Michaels Vs. Vince Mcmahon.  The pillow fight and the boogeyman Vs. Booker T matches were fillers.  All the other matches were average with ofcourse some being a little better than others.  The Money in the Bank was not as good as WM 21, but lived up to the hype.  The Smackdown championship was dissapointing, the macth was under ten minutes, and it even seemed liked the boos towards Rey Mysterio were edited (Thanks again WWE).  It was obvious the crowd was for Angle.  They made Randy Orton look bad in the match as well, I don't know why though.  The Hall of Fame was without a doubt great with the highlights being Eddie Guerrero's induction and ending it with Bret Hart's induction.",1148428800,4,1004,4.538888888888889
2529417,4,B000EQ5PUA,"Kane & The Big Show VS Carlito & Chris Masters

Definately a good match to start it out, but could've been much better. Chris Masters didn't get any time to shine, while Carlito showed once again the potential he has. Carlito & Kane definately worked great together. Match Rating- 6 out of 10

Money In The Bank Ladder Match

Bobby Lashley VS Matt Hardy VS Ric Flair VS Rob Van Dam VS Fit Finlay VS Shelton Benjamin

Another awesome MITB match this year. Ric Flair takes some nice bumps, as well everyone else for that matter. It was better then last years match and had things happen where you'd gasp.

8 out of 10

Chris Benoit VS John Bradshaw Layfield

Eh... I dunno about this one. I was expecting alot more from both of these men, but it was pretty disapointing. Definately worth one watch, but I wouldn't go back to it.

6 out of 10

Boogey Man VS Booker T.

Hopefully all DVD players have a skip button, forget this match. The only good part was... well... The red fog was kinda cool.

2 out of 10

Edge VS Mick Foley

Awesome match. They both took equal damage and both shined in this match. Better then Mick VS Randy at Backlash. The spear through the table on fire, man... when they show it in slow motion you really just go ""Holy Hell!"".

9 out of 10

Mickie James VS Trish Stratus

I liked this one. I'm gonna rank this one with other womens matches and it was MUCH better then most other womens matches.

8 out of 10

The Undertaker VS Mark Henry =Casket Match=

This wasn't a bad match at all. The only problem is Mark Henry never has established himself as a top star. No matter how hard the WWE tries, he isn't this great guy who deserves anything more then a mid-card match on smackdown. But if you can get passed that, they both put on a really good match with an awesome dive by Undertaker.

7 out of 10

Shawn Michaels VS Vince McMahon

Don't expect a wrestling match here, it's an all out brawl. The only down points were the stupid spirit squad entering the ring. Other then that it was amazing. Alot of great/exciting moves by HBK, and when he does the 'suck it' sign before hitting the elbow drop off the top of a ladder, you'll be cheering in your seats.

8 out of 10

Rey Mysterio VS Randy Orton VS Kurt Angle

Too short... I would've been happy with another 10 minutes even, I love long matches. But even tho it was short, it was fantastic. Your eyes won't leave your tv when you turn this one on. Fast paced action, I had to rewind my dvd a few times because I'd turn around, turn back and everyone would be laid out with the fans going crazy. Awesome fast paced match.

9 out of 10

John Cena VS Triple H

Match of the night! Triple H's entrance is kinda dumb but the match itself is awesome. The fans made this match what it was. They went crazy at every move made in this match. Both men worked great together and I had no idea how it would end.

The US Title match was a little better than the Tag match. Benoit should have won, oh well. We knew JBL would cheat. 7/10

No Holds Barred HBK vs Vince was awesome! Shane getting cuffed to the ring was funny. This match was very entertaining, and the D-X Crotch Chops by HBK were great. That 20 ft ladder jump was phenominal! 9/10

Triple Threat World Title- Rey vs Orton vs Angle. It was a fantastic match. Great wrestling by all 3 men. I, personally hated the outcome. It was predictable; Rey winning the title for Eddie. Much love to Eddie, but REY IS OVERRATED FOR GOD SAKES! Angle or Orton should have won. 9/10

Playboy Pillow Fight Torrie vs Candice. I'm wondering why they're in evening gowns, and why they stripped eachother. ?? I loved that Torrie won, and that she had Chole[her dog] As you would imagine this wasn't really a wrestling match per say,more of a cat fight. There were some wrestling moves. This shouldn't have been the pre main event!! MY goodness! 5.5/10

Fantabulous match! Best of the night. These men put on a great fight. Cena really has been using the ST-FU. I thought HHH would win, but no, Cena pulled it off! 10/10

Money In The Bank 2 (RVD, Flair, Shelton, Lashley, Hardy & Finlay) 90/100

Better than last year, and one of the better matches of the night. Great spots and bumps. RVD taking the win as I excpected.

Boogeyman vs. Booker T & Sharmell 41/100

I hope they don't put these matches to PPV anymore

JBL vs. Chris Benoit 77/100

Would have been worse than the opener, if JBL wouldn't have won it. That's great news of course.

Edge vs. Mick Foley 89/100

A great match, but an even greater ending. A spear through a burning table... that's just so crazy.

Mickie James vs. Trish Stratus 67/100

Trish is the only woman wrestler who can wrestle. But of course women's matches are only eye candy.

Undertaker vs. Mark Henry 74/100

Henry can't wrestle. Taker's crazy jump lifts the rating.

The match between John Cena and Triple H was also pretty good, specially the entraces and the presentation. Randy Orton vs Kurt Angle vs Rey Misterio was also quite good, and the Money in the Bank ladder match was also interesting.

But the main reason of getting this DVD is the Hall of Fame ceremony, unless you taped when aired on the USA network this is a keeper. The introduction of Eddie Guerrero was so emotional you can see the tears on everybody's face. People always said wrestling ""isn't real"" but times like that you see that the emotions cannot be duplicated. Also Bret Hart (he decided not to appear on the Wrestlemania event with the inductees) induction was memorable and it's good to see Bret getting the recognition he deserves. I think by far this is the best Hall of Fame induction ever! (yes even better than last year with Hulk Hogan and stuff) because the emotions and feelings were very real.

This was a watchable match but it was a little bit on the short side a few good moves by Kane and Big Show, like Kane doing a flying clothesline outside the ring. Carlito and Masters also showed some good teamwork. Funny ending with Master aiming for Kane but hitting Carlito. Winners and still World Tag Team

RVD vs. Ric Fliar vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Matt Hardy vs. Finlay

This match was awsome and alot of good moves from all participants. I don't wanna spoil too much but I will say that RVD does a frog splash from the ladder and that Matt Hardy does a leg drop from the ladder. Winner: Mr. Money In The Bank Rob Van Dam

Match 3

JBL vs. Chris Beniot for the U.S. Title

7.5/10

Not too many good moves in this match. A few boring spots too. Its worth a watch though for Beniots suplexes and diving head butt. Beniot also does the three amigos as a tribute to Eddie Guerrero. Beniot goes for the crossface but jbl reverses into a pin and holds the ropes and gets 1 2 3. Unfortunately new U.S. champ JBL

Vince really took a beating in this match, and so did Shane. Shane kissed his fathers ass on this night (literally). Shawn beat the holy hell out of Vince with trashcans, steel chairs, and two ladders.

2529454,4,B000EQ5PUA,"Just like last year, before the PPV portion started, there was an interpromotional Battle Royale. This will almost certainly be on this DVD. Another thing that usually gets included on the WM DVDs is the Hall of Fame induction ceremony. USA Network only showed bits and pieces of this event, and butchered Bret Hart's acceptance speech from 20ish minutes down to 6.

I also think it will be interesting to see how much WWE will edit the crowd reactions. At times, the anti-Cena chants were considerably louder than the pro-Cena ones.",1145923200,,533,4.857142857142857
2529455,4,B000EQ5PUA,"I would like to start off by saying that this was a very entertaining ppv, which focused more on entertainment rather than actual wrestling, which is by no means a bad thing.

1. Kane & Big Show vs. Carlito and Chris Masters

Not a bad match but not a very good opener.  It did its job of getting the crowd into the event, and the wrestling wasn't that bad. *3/4

2. Money in the Bank Ladder Match

A little on the short side, but this was still a fantastic match.  Lots of nice spots and every wrestler involved did their share and didn't take away from the match.  RVD had the most spots, and Shelton Benjamin and Matt Hardy had noteworthy performances as well. ****

3. U.S. title match: Chris Benoit(champ) vs. JBL(challenger)

Very solid match, but a few slow spots hurt the rating just a little bit. This is still a good match that is worth a look.  **3/4

4. Hardcore Match: Edge vs. Mick Foley

Excellent and brutal match here, both men give it their all.  Lots of weapon use and an unbelieveable ending, match of the night in my opinion. ****

5. Boogeyman vs. Booker-T and Sharmell

Simply awful, worst match of the entire night, and served no purpose being at Wrestlemania except for taking up time that could have been added to the other matches on the card. This was appalling. -*

6. Women's Title Match: Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James

A surprisingly OK contest between these two women, even with a couple missed spots.  I have never liked women's mathes, but this one is watchable.  The only thing that bothers me is the fact that the women have the ability to put on good matches, however they must choose not to 90 percent of the time. **

7. Casket Match: The Undertaker vs. Mark Henry

Undertaker is my favorite wrestler of all time, and it truly sickens me to watch him be pitted against trash ppv after ppv, and this is definatly not an exception.  Mark Henry has prooved that not even the greatest of wrestlers (the Undertaker and Kurt Angle) can put on a decent match with him.  Taker did all he could in this one, and it is a watchable match, but not good by any stretch of the imagination. *1/2

8. No Holds Barred Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Vince McMahon

A VERY entertaining match, and Shawn put it perfectly when he said it wouldn't be a wrestling match.  These two handled this contest perfectly and added a lot of ""Big Time"" moments, including an outstanding ladder spot.  The only annoying part of this match was the spirit squad interference, however it doesn't hurt the match. ***1/2

9. Triple Threat Match: Kurt Angle(champ) vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton

An excellent match in the beginning, however it ending suddenly at about 9:00, and the wrong man won the title.  I'll admit that giving Rey the title is a nice gesture considering Eddie's passing, but it was the wrong thing to do.  Having someone who weighs 150 lbs winning the world HEAVYWEIGHT title doesn't make sense in the first place, and giving the belt to him takes away from the significance of the title.  Still a very good match. ***1/2

10. Playboy Pillow Fight: Candice Michelle vs. Torrie Wilson

Garbage, could not possibly care less. DUD

11. WWE title match: John Cena(champ) vs. Triple H

My expectations were in the middle, and I must say the match did pass my expectations.  However the ending (for me) ruins most of the match, as a VERY undeserving man retains the title with an stfu.  That's right, the moveless wonder makes Triple H submit to an stfu. I let it be known that John Cena is a no-talent waste of time who deserves to be booed out of the building every time he shows his face.  As far as the match is concerned it was real good, and definately had that main event feel as the crowd was super into this one.  However the ending just flat out pissed me off, and if the WWE doesn't take the title away from Cena soon they're going to loose a long-time fan. ***3/4

All in all this was a very good wrestlemania, not so much as far as wrestling is concerned, but from an entertainment stand point it succeded.  However, the endings to the two main events left a BAD taste in my mouth, and I don't know if I can bring myself to watch them again.  If you're a fan of actual wrestling I suggest you don't buy this DVD, however if you want to be entertained then seriously contemplate purchasing this one.",1145836800,3,4325,4.456050955414013
2529456,5,B000EQ5PUA,"Kane & Big SHow vs. Carlito & Masters

A good tag match to start off the show, better than most tag matches I have seen on Raw for a while.

RATING: 75/100

Money in The Bank Ladder Match

A great second match of the night! Just about as good as last year with a few great moves by Benjamin and RVD. Also a nice addition was Hardy who did some good moves. Great match.

RATING: 88/100

Mickie James vs. Trish

A very good match. I didn't even notice the botched move that is often talked about, but I did notice an abrupt ending that hurt the rating slightly. Still a very solid match overall, and compared to regular women matches; excellent.

RATING: 78/100

Undertaker vs. Henry

Undertaker worked well here and made this match good. I enjoyed the whole thing and the fantastic leap over the casket really was a nice addition to the match. Great that WWE weren't stupid enough to end his streak.

RATING: 80/100

HBK vs. Mr. Mcmahon

What a match! Now I know this match was no classic ""wrestling"" match of last years WM, but this match was so entertaining and had so much in it that kept me on the edge of my seat filling me with sadistic laughter the entire way. I loved the DX taunts and a sadistic HBK side. Brilliantly entertaining match!

RATING: 93/100

Edge vs. Foley

Wow! This match had great potential and mostly lived up to it. Now, I believed the ending was outstanding, but I believe that it came a bit soon as the match should have been about 5 minutes longer. Still a great match typical of Foley.

RATING: 90/100

Boogeyman vs. Booker T & Sharmell

Poor. Shouldn't have been on the card. (Isn't the Book End Booker T's finisher? Why did Boogeyman kick out of it as though it were nothingwith no reaction from the announcers?)

RATING: 55/100

Chris Benoit vs. JBL

Good match, physical and technical. Was probably the only match that had a perfect length and used the minutes well.

RATING: 80/100

Candice vs. Torrie Wilson

Note: Here in SA, they didn't show this match so it will not be include in the ratings.

Orton vs. Rey vs. Angle

Although this match was shorter than the majority of most Smackdown main events, I thought that it was terrific while it lasted and didn't let up at all in action. The Rey victory was great and the Hurracanrana to end the match was a nice touch rather that the senton.

RATING: 87/100

HHH vs. Cena

I don't believe this should have been THE main event, but it delivered well and the entrances were a nice touch. A Cena victory did leave a little bit of a bitter taste in my mouth, but I suppose it `had to happen'. The match itself was good and I am glad that finally someone kicked out of the FU. The atmosphere was also very good and added to this.

RATING: 86/100

81% - Outstanding PPV and great Wrestlemania! This iteration had alsmost all. The only thing lacking was a grueling classic wrestling match, but other that, this WM was nearly perfect and deserved in my opinion, to be known as one of the greatest Wrestlemanias of all time.",1145836800,2,3001,4.41970802919708
2529457,4,B000EQ5PUA,"1. World Tag Team Championship: Carlito and Chris Masters vs. Kane and the Big Show (c)
Good opener, the crowd seemed solidly behind Carlito. Not a bad tag match either. 6.5/10

2. Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Ric Flair vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Matt Hardy vs. Lashley vs. Finlay
Great spotfest. Shelton makes his mark in this match two years in a row, and Van Dam steals the show with his high flying moves. I thought Matt Hardy was a nice addition too, considering his history in ladder matches at Wrestlemania. Crowd was definitely behind RVD all the way, and he proves why. Right man won in the end, and a good ladder match overall. 7.75/10

3. United States Championship Match: JBL vs. Chris Benoit (c)
Wasn't expecting too much from this match, and I was pretty spot on with that assumption. Benoit puts on a decent performance as always, but JBL definitely drags this one down. Never was a JBL fan, he's a bit too boring in the ring. Not a bad match tho, pretty average on the whole. 6/10.

4. Hardcore Match
Edge w/Lita vs. Mick Foley
Finally, the match I had been waiting for since its announcement on Raw. Though I was well aware of the fact that Foley is fond of putting over new talent, I was still hoping Foley would finally take home a big win this year. I expected a great, brutal match, and I was not dissapointed. Every weapon imagineable was used, and the ending needs to be seen to be believed. Crowd was on their feet the whole time, and rightfully so. Great match, a must see. 9.5/10

5. Handicap match
Booker T. and Sharmell vs. the Boogeyman
Ugh. Just ugh. Why was this left for Wrestlemania? Should have been left off the card to give more time to other matches. Just a mistake. Not even worth a look, skip this one. 0/10

6. Women's Championship match
Mickie James vs. Trish Stratus (c)
Never a fan of the Women's division, and thought this would be a bathroom break. I was mistaken, and was quite suprised by the match these two put on. Easily the best women's match I've ever seen. Nothing spectacular, but much, much better then expected. Crowd was solidly behind Mickie James, looking for a new champion. Overall, pretty good women's match. 6/10

7. Casket match
The Undertaker vs. Mark Henry
Thought this would be yet another bathroom break. Not much wrestling, and rather boring at times, considering Henry is dead weight in the ring, but a decent Taker performance. A couple good spots, and definitely worth a look, even just to see The Undertaker continue his streak. Its a shame that the Deadman is being used so poorly at such a big event, but not a terrible match. 6/10

8. No Holds Barred
Vince McMahon vs. Shawn Michaels
Was very excited for this match, since I'm a big HBK fan, and was really into the build-up. I wasn't dissapointed. The interferences only help the match, and the beating that Vince receives is very, very entertaining to watch. Also includes a ladder spot that needs to be seen. This match will definitely be remembered for years to come. Don't pass this one up. 8.5/10

9. Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle (c)
I was expecting quite a bit from this match, considering the talent involved. It was a great match straight from the start, with Angle dominating most of it. Very exciting and a good performance put on by all three men. The ending came too sudden and too quick, and the match was over in about 9 minutes, which was very dissapointing. Crowd was solidly behind Angle, which I found suprising, and even booed Mysterio on occasion, which was even more suprising, though both were welcome suprises. Sudden ending, not enough time, and the wrong man winning take this rating down quite a bit. Good with the time allowed though. 7.5/10

10. Playboy Pillow Fight
Torrie Wilson vs. Candice Michelle
I suppose it was to dull the crowd after the Triple Threat, and boy did it do its job. Snooze-fest, should have been removed from the card along with the Boogeyman match. Skip this one too. 0/10

11. WWE Championship match
Triple H vs. John Cena (c)
When it was first announced, I expected a decent match, but I didn't think the two would mix particularly well. After interesting entrances (hilarious seeing them for the first time, but they were pretty good looking back on it), the match got started, and as expected, Cena was badly booed. Probably the worst heat I've ever seen anybody get, even more then a heel. Crowd was solidly behind Triple H the entire match. Great back and forth action, and quite suspenseful and exciting. Probably Cena's best title defense as champion. Felt very much like a Wrestlemania Main Event, because of the hype and the way these two battled in the ring. The crowd was a huge help in making this match seem memorable. Very good match, great effort by both men. Although I do think yet again, the wrong man wins this one. 8.5/10

Overall, this was a great Wrestlemania. Didn't offer much in terms of ""wrestling"", but was a very entertaining show that didn't dissapoint (most of the time). Many classic moments, and only a couple hiccups in the card. I was very dissapointed in how little time they gave the Triple Threat, but I was glad that HHH vs Cena was the main event. Crowd was excellent, probably the best crowd I've ever seen. They were into almost every match, other then the Boogeyman match and the pillow fight, which is understandable.

2529459,5,B000EQ5PUA,"Wrestlemania 22 was placed with the tagline ""Big Time"" so you knew the WWE had some big expectations of themselves going into the event. In this young man's opinion, they did indeed live up and exceed their own expectations. Here is the card with 1-10 ratings on the matches like everyone else does.

Match 1:

World Tag Team Championship match

Carlito and Chris Masters vs. Kane and the Big Show (champs)

Winners: Kane and the Big Show

Rating: 6.5/10

It was an okay match that didn't do much but further the Carlito and Masters dissention. Good start to an awesome night though.

Match 2:

Money in the Bank Ladder Match 2

Ric Flair vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Matt Hardy vs. Lashley vs. Finley

Winner: Rob Van Dam

Rating: 8/10

Very well executed, exciting high spots and a happy ending to boot. Rob Van Dam is looking to get his first legit chance at the World Championship since Unforgiven 2002 and basically let the cat out of the bag by heavily hinting that he will cash it in at One Night Stand.

Match 3:

United States Championship Match

JBL w/Jillian Hall (very cute without the mole) vs. Chris Benoit (champ)

Winner: JBL (new champ)

Rating: 6/10

Aggresive match that was not too bad but did not set the world on fire either. At least the U.S. title has some credibility since former World Champions are fighting over it.

Match 4:

Hardcore Match

Edge w/Lita vs. Mick Foley

Winner: Edge

Rating: 9/10

Fantastic hardcore match with both men giving it their all. The finishing sequence was absolutely amazing and has to be seen to be believed.

Match 5:

Handicap (kinda sorta) match

Booker T. and Sharmell vs. the Boogeyman

Winner: The Boogeyman

Rating: 2/10

The only good thing about this match was the segment beforehand with Goldust, Eugene, Snitsky, Ted Dibiase, Mae Young, and Moolah commiting comedic hijinks. I am a Booker T. fan through and through and he did what he could to make the match work but it was doomed from the start. The Boogeyman is no Booker T. and I hope when he returns from injury that he'll be pushed a little slower and learn his craft a little bit.

Match 6:

Women's Championship match

Mickie James vs. Trish Stratus (champ)

Winner: Mickie James (new champ)

Rating: 7/10

I'm not to keen on Women's wrestling but these two sure can go and put on the best Women's match I've seen in the WWE in a while. I enjoy Mickie James' character and find her current storyline with Trish interesting. A first for WWE Women's wrestling in my book.

Match 7:

Casket match

the Undertaker vs. Mark Henry

Winner: The Undertaker

Rating: 5/10

I think I almost dozed off during this one and that's too bad because I love the Undertaker, he's one of my favorites. The Undertaker gave it his all but this match just was not too interesting. I did snap out of it once he did a suicide dive over the casket and actually hoisted up and Tombstoned Mark Henry. 14-0 at Wrestlemania for the Undertaker.

Match 8:

Street Fight

Vince McMahon vs. Shawn Michaels

Winner: Shawn Michaels

Rating: 10/10

Perfect exectution for this type of match. The best match with Vince McMahon since St. Valetine's Day 1999 vs. Steve Austin because the logical thing happened; Vince got destroyed. Anytime an authority figures wrestles an actually wreslter, this is what should happen. I'll remember this trashing of epic proportions for years to come.

Match 9:

Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship

Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle (champ)

Winner: Rey Mysterio (new champ)

Rating: 8/10

This match was on it's way to 10/10 status until it ended 9:00 minutes in. Too bad they had the ""pillow fight"" follwing this eating up time, just five more minutes, and this could have been a 9/10, ten more and it would be a 10/10. Rey Mysterio is great and deserves a World Champsionship but I predict that Kurt Angle will get it back at Judgement Day and mow down competition until Batista is 100% and Randy Orton is back in the game, then Smackdown truely be compelling. That's just how I see it.

As I mentioned previously there was a pillow fight of sorts between Torrie Wilson and Candice. There was no use of pillows, just Torrie beating up Candice, good for a breather before the main event but it took away some good time away from Smackdown's main event. Oh well, on to the main event.

Match 10:

WWE Championship match

Triple H vs. John Cena (champ)

Winner: John Cena

Rating: 9.5/10

Bizarre entrances aside, this match was exciting and definately tossed a curveball at me when Cena won via submission. I was so sure that Triple H was going to win, it looked inevitable. I was ready to see my favorite wrestler (Triple H) win the title for the 11th time and bam, with about ten minutes of air time left, Triple H heads for the Pedigree but Cena gets a crazy reverse and locks in the STFU. I thought for sure that Triple H was going to get the ropes, hit a low blow or get a fancy counter, hit the Pedigree and make the rabid Chicago fans happy. Instead, Triple H taps and the Chicago crowd as well as myself becomes shocked. This was already a good enough match from both Triple H and Cena but the crowd made it even more compelling. Definately worthy of a Wrestlemania Main Event.

Closing Comments: This card far exceeded expectations and definatley has things looking good for the WWE in the near future. Thus far, the WWE is following up on Wrestlemania quite well with Backlash looking to be great and the revival of the King of the Ring on Smackdown!. I haven't been shocked by a finish like I was with Triple H vs. John Cena in a while and I've been watching wrestling for about 13-14 years (I'm 18 now). In fact, the last time I was that shocked was Goldberg's first WCW loss, I couldn't believe that. But I digress, Wrestlemania 22 is worth the 20 or more dollars on DVD especially considered the boatload of extras that are bound to be on it.",1145404800,23,5928,4.555871212121212

2529470,4,B000EQ5PUA,"WrestleMania, the show of shows, the card of cards with the match of matches. Not so much this year, but with some true exceptions. So yea, let's get into it.

Kane and Big Show vs Carlito and Masters - First match of the night, and not a bad one aside from Kane and Show winning, which was a ridiculous decision. Apparently WWE is gonna try and turn Carlito face, which is wrestling talk for they're gonna make him a good guy. So Kane and Show win this tag team championship match only to lose the titles to the Spirit Squad the following night on Raw. I'm a Carlito fan, so I don't think to much of this match altogether, but it's not a bad match considering. 4 out of 10 stars.

Money In The Bank Ladder Match - RVD vs Benjamin vs Finlay vs Ric Flair vs Lashley vs Matt Hardy. Some good spots in this match from Benjamin RVD and Hardy. See this is the match I would've had Carlito in, win or lose, it was a goof of a decision to not book Carlito in this one AND have him job to Kane and Show. Anywho, a reasonably exciting outing, especially since everyone's favorite wrestler Rob....Van....DAM!... wins after pushing Benjamin and Hardy off a ladder and out of the ring. Hardy takes the bump hard, but Shelton being mr. athletic fanagled his way down. 7 stars out of 10.

JBL vs Chris Benoit - U.S. Title match between two good talents. Benoit is apparently mr. popularity now, and JBL is the king of heel promos. This alone sets up an interesting premise, but then the match starts. Not so hot. Until JBL starts to make fun of the late Eddie Guerrero. I did not like this, but no denying it made the match more interesting. So what happens is Benoit locks in his Crippler Crossface finisher, but it gets reversed and JBL holds onto the ropes to win the US Title. Benoit makes his usual ""I got cheated"" face after the match as JBL gloats back up the aisle way with his manager. 5 out of 10 stars

Edge vs Mick Foley - Hardcore match. VI-O-LENCE. Folks, this is a good one. imo, not as good as Foley vs Orton, but just by a tad. This ones got thumbtacks, barbed wire, flaming tables, the whole shabang. Weirdly enough I don't remember if there were chairs in this match, but theres a good chance. Both guys are bloody, even Edge's manager is a little bloody after tasting the barbed wire, but Edge wins via the Spear to end all Spears. 8 out of 10 stars

Booker T and Sharmell vs Boogeyman - As you'll prolly hear from everyone else who wrote a review, this match isn't even worth mentioning. 0 entertainment value and just a horrible match to be put on a WrestleMania card. Booker T is another guy who shoulda been in the Money in the Bank match instead of Lashley or Flair, as Booker T is one of WWE's total package wrestlers who is squandered, and this match is a fine example. Guys got mic skills, can put on a great match against all most any wrestler, can get heel heat without using cheap heat, and is also one of the top 3 heels on Smackdown, and the guy knows ring psychology. But alas, they made him and his wife face a worm eating moron in the worst match of the night. 0 out of 10 stars.

Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James - Women's Title match. Here you have two of the best Women's wrestlers in all of North America in Trish and Mickie James. and they deliver in perhaps the best Female's match in WrestleMania history. a few botches, but still very entertaining. The crowd turns on Trish half-way through and starts booing all of her moves. Which is the start of Chicago's skewed cheers for the night. Don't get confused as this isn't a matter of Trish sucking or not being hot, but today's wrestling fans cannot STAND long title reigns, and by the time of this match, Trish was Women's champ for a little over a year. Anyways, Mickie wins after the Mick Kick. 8 out of 10 stars

Undertaker vs Mark Henry - Casket match. Filler match. The ONLY reason this match even happened is to continue Undertaker's little WrestleMania streak. The guy never jobs anyways, but especially not at WM. And this is the case as Taker manages to pick up the huge Mark Henry and tombstone him, and roll him in the casket in a subpar match. funny instance where Taker tries going for his Last Ride powerbomb, but can't pick him all the way up. Cole still tries to sell it, but anyone who knows knows it was just a powerbomb. I don't care much for Taker, and this match was just........ nuff said. However there was one instance where Taker went Old School and launches himself over the top rope over the casket and onto Henry which was pretty cool. Personally, I'd like to see Taker vs Batista at a WM, and we might've seen it at this one had Batista gotten surgery when he was supposed to instead of being a glory hog. 4 out of 10 stars.

Shawn Michaels vs Mr. McMahon - No Holds Barred. I'll level with ya, this match happened because Vince wanted to make up for Austin vs Hogan not happening. And boy did he. If you wanna see a man just get beaten beyond of the point of getting the [...] kicked out of him, watch this match. Chairshots, smashed tables, ladder jumps, trash cans hits, all from the former Heartbreak Kid, i say former becuz hes what like 42 now. but on top of this colossal job, Michaels even takes time out of the match to handcuff and cane Vince's son with a Singapore Cane. Vince is bloody after the beatdown of the night when he gets superkicked and pinned. 6 out of 10 star match

KURT ANGLE vs Randy Orton vs Rey Mysterio - WHT Match. On one hand it's good to see Kurt Angle go into WM with a main event title again, becuz Kurt Angle is another Total Package wrestler. On the other, they end Angle's title reign to put over a charity case. And you'll hear it from the crowd if you buy this dvd. Angle is tooooootally the favorite and deservedly so, as we all know how much Kurt Angle rules and it comes off again as Angle dominates this match with his barrage of suplexes and the dreaded Angle Slam. And even makes both Rey and Orton tap out during the match, only to get jipped on both accounts. This match runs about 9 minutes with Rey pinning Orton after the 619 and the West Coast Pop. Also Orton gets in an RKO on Angle at one point in the match. 7 out of 10 star match.

Candice Michelle vs Torrie Wilson - Playboy Pillow Fight. Don't let the name fool you, there is no nudity in this match as the old looking Torrie Wilson beats Candice Michelle with a rollup. This rivals Booker vs Boogeyman in the worst match of the night category. 0.5 out of 10 stars.

John Cena vs Triple H - WWE Championship. The main event for the richest and most prestigous prize in all of Professional Wrestling. If you've been a wrestler who became a household name, you've held this title. Hogan, Andre The Giant, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, Triple H, to Kurt Angle, Bret Hitman Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Brock Lesnar, to Macho Man Randy Savage, Ric Flair, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Jericho and soon, R...V...D. And now.... John Cena. Good hype leading into this match and the match TOOOOOOOTALLY delivers. In case you didn't already know, Chicago is an ECW town, and it really comes through. Two over the top and oddly good entrances from Triple H and Cena set up the final hype before the match. Now Cena gets booed somethin' fierce in this one. The crowd is about 50/50 but obviously boo's ring way louder than cheers. The crowd rips into Cena with FU Cena chants, but with no abbreviation, and Cena Sucks chants vs the ongoing Let's Go Cena chants. The match on it's own is good, but the crowd turns this match into a must see. As the evil talent squashing Triple H plays to the crowd, and Cena does his best to shrug it off and make it seem like this is the first time this has happened. Just a really fun match to watch, way better than last year's Cena vs JBL and HHH vs Batista main events. Now I know alot of ppl out there don't like Cena, but cheering Triple H? That suprised me. I knew Cena would walk out of WM with the title and I wasn't disappointed as I knew WWE wouldn't put over a bad guy with the nickname ""the King of Kings"" in the main event on the biggest stage in all of wrestling. not THIS year anyways, as HHH debuted his King of Kings moniker just two months before. Backlash, well that's another story, I think HHH will walk out of Backlash with the title, but on this night, at the Granddaddy of em all with the Title of all Titles on the line, Cena defeated Triple H with the STFU submission move in a match that just ruled. 9.5 out of 10 stars.

Overall a 6 or 7 star WrestleMania. Not the best WM of all time, but by no means the worst. Near Future predictions, HHH wins the title at Backlash, RVD wins it at ECW One Night Stand, then drops it back to HHH, becuz HHH has issues with burying talent, at either Vengeance or the final Raw before the July SmackDown ppv. And then Cena wins it back at SummerSlam in Boston a month before his movie comes out. How do I know this? Because I know wrestling :)",1144972800,2,8950,4.289349112426035
2529471,5,B000EQ5PUA,"Ever Since Wrestlemania XX, it looks likes WWE has been trying to impress somebody. Wrestlemania XX was advertised about 9months in advance and got huge publicity. But it was simply a pathetic PPV let alone it was WM XX!! There were 2 matches worth watching on it, the 2 World Title Bouts. Then there was Wrestlemania 21 which was just plain better than the previous WM. It had the money in the bank ladder match, the Rey vs Eddie, and the HBK vs Angle. AWESOME. And then theres WM 22 which in my eyes in the best WM yet. Edge Vs Foley was the best match on the card and is worth the price of the dvd alone. The Money in the Bank Match was excellent and hilarious when Ric Flair ""hurt"" his ankle and was brought back to the locker room by trianers and EMTS. (he was back in like 5 minutes, how realistic) What the heck is a 57 year old man in that kind of match for? Not Counting the money in the bank match which was of coursed won by a RAW Guy, RVD. I can See RVD cashing in te title shot at ECW's ONE NIGHT STAND this year. The Smackdown main event was great (not a Rey Mysterio fan though) Too bad it was 9 minutes long. Smackdown got 33 minutes of action as raw got 76 minutes.(WWE obviously only cares about RAW)WM 22 had even the best womens match in WM history. (there wasn't much competition) The only downside to this WM was the Booker T vs Boogeyman match. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Who in WWE thought this was a good idea? They should be fired. I never expect much from a WWE ppv because im used to the TNA ones that are just plain better, but I must admit, this is a MUST-BUY. Every wrestling fan needs to see Foley Vs Edge. (Barbwire bats, thumbtacks, Flaming Tables-DUH)So buy this dvd ppl.",1144800000,,1700,4.167173252279635

the croud was soo into this match boooing cena it was unbeliveable. i don't think there was ONE person in the world who though cena would retain. outstange match by both men. cena performed well under the heat of the croud and the entrances were a laugh. a surprise ending no one expected look at the face in the croud after at one point the cameron shows a group of guy all mouthing out WHAAT THE F##K JUST HAPPEND. awsum match

10/10

Match 3: JBL vs. Benoit

Good solid technical match. Bad thing was they only got given around 12 minutes and JBL kept taking the mick out of Eddie Guerrero which was lame. 7/10

Match 4: Hardcore Match - Edge vs. Foley

Match of the night, a wicked ending one of the best you have seen at wrestlemania's for years. It was bloody, violent and full of entertainment. 9/10

Match 5: Booker T/Sharmell vs. Boogeyman

Poor match, a fantastic wrestler like Booker shouldn't be used in such a bad match, luckly it was kept short. 3/10

Match 6: Mickie James vs. Trish

A great technical womans match, one of the best ever seen. Good to see a new womans champion. But two flaws were that the crowd cheered for Mickey and booed Trish, and the ending was botched

6/10

Match 7: Mark Henry vs. Undertaker

Awful match, slow and very boring. Undertaker should be used in a much better match. But considering it was a bad match there were some good moves like henry's power slam, undertakers dive over the ropes, last ride and tombstone. 5/10

Match 8: No Holds Barred - Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. McMahon

A very good and entertaining match, it was very good for Michaels to get his revenge after what they put him through. It was very funny as well, a big highlight of the event 8/10

Match 9: Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle

A very good match, but only lasted 10 minutes which totally ruined the match, all finshers were used and for 10 minutes it was very good, but 10 minutes for a wrestlemania main event is very poor 6/10

Match 10: Playboy Pillow fight

Pointless match, why did they put here, the crowd booed 1/10

Match 11: John Cena vs. Triple

A very good match, the crowd were into it, and it never got boring, some good technical wrestling and a surprise ending which was great. 8/10

2529475,5,B000EQ5PUA,"1. Carlito and Chris Masters vs Big Show and Kane- Decent opener with a lot of dominance once again by Kane and Show. It would've made more sense to lose to Masters and Carlito rather than the Spirit Squad. Winner- Kane and Big Show 6.5/10

2. Money in the Bank Ladder Match- Great match that was as great as the first. Sick spots in this match. Once again Shelton Benjamin stole the show when he ran up the ladder and did a flip. Wow that was great and other spots also. Winner-RVD 9/10

3. JBL vs Chris Benoit- Good match that was short for what these guys could've done. Not anything really spectacular but it is watchable. Winner-JBL 7/10

4. Edge vs Mick Foley- WOW! Great match that had me on my feet the whole way through. Sick spots involving thumbtacks, barbed wire, and a table on fire! Outstanding ending when Edge speared Foley into the fire. Best Match of the night and possible Match of the year candidate. Winner Edge 10/10

5. Boogeyman vs Booker T and Sharmell- Boring, nothing special, crappy match. Booker T deserves much more than this losing to a freak named the Boogeyman. Skip this match. Winner-Boogeyman 2/10

6- Trish Stratus vs Mickie James- Good womens match with both doing nice moves. Great feud going into this match. Trish loses her title after an over year title reign. Winner- Mickie James 7.5/10

7- Undertaker vs Mark Henry- Good match but also very predictable. Best spot in the match is when Taker went over the top rope and over the casket and hit Mark Henry. Winner- Undertaker 7/10

8. Shawn Michales vs Vince Mcmahon- Good hardcore match with Shane and the Spirt Squad interfering. Funny when Michaels was hitting Shane with the Kendo stick over and over when he was handcuffed onto the rope. Great ending when Michales delivered the elbow drop onto Vince from a 20 foot high ladder! Winner- Shawn Michaels 9/10

9. Randy Orton vs Rey Mysterio vs Kurt Angle- Good match in the time given. I was upset that they only had 9 minutes. This match could've stole the show. With the time given the action was fast paced and exciting. Winner- Rey Mysterio 8/10

10. Candice Michelle vs Torrie Wilson in a playboy pillow fight- Boring match with the pillow not being used once in the whole match. How do they call the match a pillow fight and there is not 1 pillow used. Winner- Torrie Wilson 1/10

11. John Cena vs HHH- Good match, bad ending. HHH pretty much dominates the whole thing except for the ending. It looks like HHH was going to win when he hit Cena with the sledgehammer. Cena wins with the stfu and gets a negative crowd reaction. Winner- John Cena 8/10

A great Mania all around with 2 matches out of 11 were boring or horrible. A great Mania that was really BIG TIME! Highly Recomended.",1144627200,,2735,4.538617886178862
2529476,4,B000EQ5PUA,"Carlito/Masters vs. Kane/Big Show

Good match to kick off the show. Nothing amazing, but nothing boring. Hopefully Masters and Carlito can get decent single pushes. 6/10

MITB II

Great match. Not as good as last years, but still very entertaining. Benjamin, RVD and Hardy were the stars here, but Flair also took two big bumps. 8/10

JBL vs. Benoit

Good solid midcard match. Its a shame Benoit lost the title, but hopefully he can get a World Title Push now. 7/10

Edge vs. Foley

This was awesome. Match of the night. This was just non-stop action and ending has to be seen to believed. 9/10

Booker T/Sharmell vs. Boogeyman

Absolute rubbish. Its a shame Booker T has to be used in this wasy. This was probably slightly better than Boogeyman vs. JBL than Royal Rumble, but thats not saying much. 3/10

Mickie James vs. Trish

Very good match. This told a great story with Mickie working on Trish's leg. Trish's comeback was good and crowd were involved from the get-go. It's a shame the ending was botched. 7/10

Mark Henry vs. Undertaker

Henry's offense was awful in this match (apart from that powerslam), but Undertaker managed to make the match a bit more exciting at the end. Henry shouldn't be on a Wrestlemania. 5/10

Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. McMahon

This wasn't really a match, but more of a squash. don't get me wrong, it puts the E in WWE, but I feel HBK could have been used better elsewhere. 7/10

Orton vs. Rey vs. Angle

For the 9 minutes they got, they done everything they possibly could. It was awesome for the time they got, but for that time, it didn't feel like a Wrestlemania main event. I was expecting more from this, but that was not the wrestlers' fault. 7/10

Playboy Pillow fight

Rubbish. Thats all I'm saying. 2/10

Cena vs. Triple

This match was great, but the crowd probably made it better than it was. The 22 minutes seemed to fly by which is a good thing and both wrestlers played their roles well. Great ending as well, though some people didn't like it. 8/10

Overall, very good show. A must-buy DVD for any wrestling fan.",1144540800,,2062,4.546195652173913

C Big Show and Kane vs. Chris Masters and Carlito

A nice way to kick off the show. Non stop action for about 10 minutes or so. Carlito and Masters are going to be something special for a long time to come and Kane and the Big show are simply good. 7/10

Money In The Bank

Amazing WOW! Shelton Benjamin is amazing. This was the match with a bunch of different styles..You had Ric Flair pulling off the high spots and taking bumps like Terry funk. Way to hard for his age. You had Benjamin making the match exciting like usual. And you had the High Flying Ability of RVD. Great match everyone performed well here. Winner RVD 10/10

United States Championship

Champion Benoit vs. JBL

This match to me wasn't anything real special. It was the same old Benoit having to carry JBL through the whole match. JBL has a great character but he is very limited in wreslting ability. Benoit loses the title after JBL cheats. 6/10

Hardcore Match

Edge vs. Mick Foley

Great match. The action never stops here and both men took their bodies to the limit. Foley really shouldn't being doing this stuff anymore but he is great at it so whats harm haha. Both men work great together and the match was simply amazing. The fire was great as well. 10/10

No Holds Barred Vince vs. Shawn Michaels

This match was basically a squash. And a way for Shawn to beat the hell out of vince for 15 minutes. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. This match was great. The elbow from the ladder was amazing. 10/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Champion Kurt Angle vs. Rey vs. Orton

I thought this Match could have been an extra ten minutes if they had cut out the dumb pillow fight. For the 10 minutes that this match was on it was geat non stop action. I don't have a problem with Rey Winning the title. It is different.. It's funny how us the wwe fans were sick of seeing the same old wreslters on top..but when a deserving fresh face wins the title we complain about it???? anyway 8/10

WWE Champion John Cena vs. HHH

The entrances were awful.. It was hard to sit through them. Funny how both the entrances combined were longer than the world title match. Anyway the match was absolutely amazing. You could cut the tension with a knife and the crowd was electric. Both men put on a great show here..Im getting sick of people booing Cena for no reason. His in ring skills arn't that bad and people underestimate him. Great match! 10/10",1144540800,,3359,4.40194489465154

2529490,5,B000EQ5PUA,"Kane and Big Show(champions) vs Carlio and Chris Masters*RAW Tag Titles*: This match I missed the first time around because of signal problems but caught it again on the replay. I wasn't expecting too much out of this one but I can say it was better than I thought it would be. Nothing really to mention though, just a normal match, nothing better than what you would see on RAW but still a good opener. 3/5 Stars

Money in the Bank Ladder Match: My only problem with this match was how they made SD! out to just be pushed to the side to let RAW shine overall and although I think last years MITB was better this one was still a great match. Alot of spots in this one as expected(RVD & Shelton owned that match) Sick bump from Matt at the end. I think this match was seriously put up or shut up for most of the guys in it. I think the most deserving man(RVD) won and i'm happy that he did. I'd love to see him take the title from Cena and be able to have a good run with it. 4/5 Stars

Benoit(champion) vs. JBL*US Title*: Another match I wasn't expecting too much from. JBL is just out of shape and it's showing. Benoit is one of the most technically sound men in the WWE right now, and is being held back in my opinion. Benoit has the talent to be in the World Title picture right now but I don't really see him being able to move out of the mid-card level for awhile if at all again. JBL of course cheaply steals this one, which I was expecting but I wish I would've been wrong. 3.5/5 Stars

Edge vs Mick Foley: This one I was really looking forward to. I knew both men definitely weren't afraid to to take some big bumps and lay it all on the line to entertain us fans and I was right. Edge is a good in ring talent in my opinion and can pull a big one out when he really wants to. Foley is the hardcore legend and has been putting his body on the line for years to make sure everyone remembered his match when the show was over. Lots of blood here with barbed wire, tables, thumbtacks, fire, whatever they could think of to make this one big. The ending I believe is what everyone will remember with the table going ablaze and Edge spearing Foley through the ropes to the outside through the flaming table. It definitely was a good spot and Edge put his face right into the flames if you notice which he really didn't have to but nonetheless a great spot. Overall I think this match was just what it needed to be, not alot of pretty technical moves going on, just an all out brawl with both men putting it all on the line for the people and I applaude them for that. 4.5/5 Stars

The Boogeyman vs Booker T & Sharmell: I don't know what Booker did to deserve being in this rediculous squash to Boogeyman. Booker is one of the most talented men in the WWE yet he's forced to go out on the biggest stage of them all and carry a very green rookie only to be put down with basically one move for the 3 count. This feud should've just been ended on an episode of SD! and then throw Booker into the match with JBL and Benoit and make it a Triple Threat. This match was basically just filler and quite boring, considering Booker had to do most of the work to make Boogeyman look good. 2.5/5 Stars

Trish Stratus(champion) vs Mickie James*Women's Title*: This match I have to say surprised me. Quite possibly one of the best, no THE best women's match in a very long time. Both Trish and Mickie are great female athletes and they showed it here with this one. My only complaint about this match was that this should've been another triple threat and have Victoria, who is another great female wrestler thrown into the mix to make it a bit more interesting. Still, these two showed how women's wrestling should be. They prove that women in wrestling can be easy on the eyes and still go in there and put on a great contest. The only down part of the match was the botched Stratusfaction but the rest of the match made up for it. I'm glad to see Mickie pick up the win, I think she will make a great women's champion and hopefully this angle with Trish will continue. 4.5/5 Stars

Undertaker vs Mark Henry*Casket Match*: Another match where one superstar pretty much had to carry the other. I don't know why Mark Henry is still around, it was a dumb idea to sign this guy to a 10 year contract. Taker's match last year against Orton was alot better, and atleast then you kind of had a doubt in your mind that the Undertaker might actually lose. The only hight spot in this match IMO was Taker's dive to the outside over the ropes and over the casket to land on Henry. Although I think Taker's days are numbered in the business, he can still put on a decent match with just about anyone he's put in the ring with. I think they already knew this match wouldn't be too great as just a normal one-on-one and they had to throw the casket stipulation in to make it worth watching. Not the best match of the night but still better than I expected. 3.5/5 Stars

HBK vs Vince: I think in this one, Vince really got what he deserved. One thing Michaels mentioned that is absolutely correct is that Vince really needs to grow up. His head is too big for the rest of his way too oiled up and very orange body. I think this one was good, but could've been alot better if it was Shawn vs. Shane instead of Vince. Again, not a very impressive match, but the big ladder spot at the end will have everyone praising it of course. Not really a wrestling match(which it wasn't supposed to be to begin with) so I don't have much to say. As I mentioned the ending makes the match. 4/5 Stars

Kurt Angle(champion) vs. Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio*World Title*: This was the main match I was looking forward to of the night. I knew all three of these guys could really go and put on one hell of a match together. But that was kind of set short, everyone has said the same thing so I don't have to tell you why the match wasn't as good as it could've been. Still, with the restricions they had, these guys still put on a great match. Angle was definitely the fan favorite in this one. I know alot of people are complaining about Mysterio picking up the win, even though I do think Eddie passing away had alot to do with it i'm not upset about him winning although I wish Orton would've picked up the win. These guys were pushed aside in order to leave more time for the main event which was dumb because the show ended 10 mins early I believe so that time definitely should've gone to this match. Still, a great effort by all three men and a great match for the time they had. 4.5/5 Stars

Torrie Wilson vs. Candice Michelle: Wow....this was just embarrassing, this should've been the opener, not between the 2 main events. It was a playboy pillow fight, you can pretty much imagine this entire match in your mind. Pointless. 0.5/5 Stars

John Cena(champion) vs. Triple H*WWE Title*: First things first, what alot of people seem to talk about when reviewing this match is the entrances. If you missed it on PPV, when you buy it on DVD, you'll know what everbody is talking about. I for one really enjoyed both entrances. The whole ""King of Kings"" feel with HHH was awesome with the throne and the attire, I loved all of it. Cena's entrance I enjoyed also, I was surprised when I saw CM Punk as one of the extra gangsters in the car(if you look closely you'll notice him). Now for the match. I loved how they did the introducions, it really gave it a big match feel and put you on edge for what was coming up. As expected, the crowd really trashed Cena. They were about 90% pro-HHH. Trips almost seemed to be a bit of a babyface at times during the match. As far as the actual wrestling and performance of the 2 men, It wasn't all that great but it was one of the better of the night. The crowd definitely made this one seem alot better than it actually was. If that crowd was dead silent, this match would be getting trashed by everyone. Although, as another reviewer stated, this match had great storytelling and I think they really played off the crowds reactions and had everyone on their feet by the end. It was that intense and that much tension in that arena, and you could literally feel it. Trips tapping definitely shocked alot of people, that makes 3 WM's in a row that HHH has lost. I'm not one of the people bashing on Cena every chance I get because I think he's a great entertainer, even if he's not the greatest wrestler, he knows how to work a crowd. Best match of the night without a doubt, not because of the wrestling, but because of how well these two worked the crowd and really told the story in their match. 5/5 Stars

-Overall this was a great show, the crowd was hot the entire night and really made up for some lackluster matches. Some surprising wins and losses and I think one of the best WrestleMania's of all time. 4.5/5 Stars for overall show.",1144368000,4,8842,4.2540154669839385
2529491,4,B000EQ5PUA,"Kane and Big Show vs Carlio and Chris Masters: Carlito and Masters definetely should've won. Masters accidently hits Carlito and which leads to him getting choke slammed by Kane. Just for Kane and Show to lose the belts on Raw to....The Spirit Squard ?? and for Carlito to make an unconvincing face turn by attacking the Masterpiece on Raw.
2 out of 4

  Money in the Bank: It had a ton of bumps with some wild moves by Shelton Benjaman and RVD. RVD deservingly won but if he wins the belt he'll probably just lose it quickly like Edge. If the winner of money in the bank holds the belt shorter than they hold the briefcase, then what's the point in taking all those bumps in the match ? Still though this was one of the best matches of the night.
3 1/2 out of 4

  JBL vs Beniot: Beniot beat HHH 3 wrestlemanias ago but instead it furthering his career he's in a midcard match and HHH is still in the mainevent ?? He had to put JBL over like 3 times already and....they made it 4 times at this WM. I was in shock when they had him lose the U.S. title to a fat and out of shape JBL. It's truly sad seeing the best wrestler on the roster used so poorly. It's not a bad match really but the wrong person won! WWE needs to wake up and kiss Beniot's ass as much as they do Triple H and Rey Mysterio. I mean Eddie traveled to the WWE following Beniot, where was Rey then ? So I would've rather have seen Beniot get a World title push for Eddie than Rey. Instead Beniot and Chavo lose when they dedicate a match to Eddie but Rey wins ?? This shows how far down hill the WWE has gone.
2 1 /2 out or 4

  Edge vs Mick Foley: This match was violent and another one of the better matches of the night. Edge wins like he deserved to win. I mean he had a short reighn when he deserves the belt more than Cena. So good thing he didn't lose to Foley after just getting off losing to Cena  a few times. The end of this match is wild too with Edge doing a spear to Foley through a flaming table.
4 out of 4

  The Boogie Man vs Booker T: The best thing about this match was Sharmel getting kissed by the Boogie Man with a mouthful of warms. I like Boogie Man, he's fresh, funny and gross when the Undertaker is tired, old and corny. Still  though Booker T. and JBL beat Beniot when the Boogie Man has beat JBL and Booker his first time tyring. When Boogie's skills are nowherer near Beniot's. So it's pretty sad. Booker was basically in charge most the match but eventually walks in to Boogie's move for Boogie to pick up the win. Booker deserves better than this too. When is he gonna be the 6 time, 6 time, 6 time, 6 time, 6 time, 6 time world champion already ? lol. It's still an entertaining match though.
2 1/2 out of 4

  Trish vs Mickie James: I like Mickie and Trish did hold the belt for an insane ammount of time. I mean they even let her hold the belt the entire time she was injured. Plus Mickie is an entertaining personality and when she grabs Trish in the wrong places in this match it gets a good laugh. She does botch up when she goes for the Stratisfaction though and J.R. blames it on Trish's ankle going out. Anyway Mickie wins with a weak chick kick, yet I can't say this match was that bad. It's one of the few entertaing women wrestling matches.
2 1/2

  Undertaker vs Mark Henry in a casket match: Gee I wonder who will win and gee I wonder...why the hell did this match even happen. If Taker's winning streak is gonna be on the line, then they should've had a better opponent for him. His match with Randy Orton last year was way way way better than this predictable match. Undertaker wins with a Tombstone and by rolling Henry into the casket
2 out of 4

HBK vs Vince: HBK basically does all the work here but it's still a fun match with us seeing a lot of the old HBK. He beats the hell out of Vince and Vince takes beaten and since he deserved it, it was entertaining. Enough of this feud already though. I mean HBK and....God ?? vs Vince and Shane at Backlash. I wonder if Shawn can pull a fast one and have Hogan as his partner lol. I mean some people do consider him god.
3 1/2 out of 4

  Rey vs Orton vs Angle: I think Angle should've won this one. I mean he put over Cena for months. He got the title only because Batista was injured ?? That shows how crappy the WWE is now. Batista and Cena as champs when great wrestlers like Beniot and Angle get mis-used. Rey's 8 minute ring entrance as a group sings his song pretty much gives away that he's gonna win this one. Orton even deserves another reighn since HHH stole his last one and made him look weak. Rey gets the belt because Eddie died, it makes me wish Eddie was still alive to win the belt. Rey as champ just doesn't work for me. Hell they'll probably have Beniot job to him next and that would just be extremely sad. This was still another of the better matches. Since all 3 wrestlers can go. Just bugs me seeing Rey getting a super push when Beniot was Eddie's real bestfriend. Anyway Rey wins the the 6:19 on Randy Orton to start what will hopefully be a short reighn.
3 1/2 out of 4

  HHH vs Cena: They both play dress-up in the beginning of the match. HHH comes out dressed like Connan and then Cena comes out dressed like a mobster ""gangster"". Is this a lingerie match or a wrestling match ??? lol. I think HHH should've stepped back and let someone else on Raw wrestle at WM. Especially since he doesn't even win this one. I wrote WWE a few times saying this only would've been a good match if it was a mid-card match with no title on the line but do they ever listen to the fans or care what we think..? No. Anyway it's an ok match but not the best WM mainevent. Cena wins with the STFU which is dumb. Beniot should've gone down as the only guy WM to have made HHH tap-out but Cena who's not even in Beniot's league now can say he did too. Plus no lets not kiss HHH's ass for putting over Cena since he has power and didn't have to put him over. HHH is smart and knows he will be remembered more than everyone he puts over. He'll be champ by the ECW ppv I predict anyway.

KANE & BIG SHOW vs. CARLITO & CHRIS MASTERS - WWE Tag Team Title match

Pretty much a squash. Late in the match, Masters tried to break up a chokeslam attempt, but hit Carlito by mistake. The heels bickered afterward.

WINNERS: Big Show & Kane to retain the WWE Tag Team Titles in 6:00.

STAR RATING: *

RIC FLAIR vs. MATT HARDY vs. SHELTON BENJAMIN vs. ROB VAN DAM vs. FIT FINLAY vs. BOBBY LASHLEY -- Money in the Bank match

Shelton leaped over the top rope onto three wrestlers at ringside for an early highspot. Hardy suplexed Flair off the ladder. Flair's legs landed awkwardly on the bottom rope. Flair was helped out of the ringside area by two officials, grabbing at his knee and screaming in pain. Looked like worked selling. Shelton moved out of the path of an RVD Rolling Thunder. Shelton went for a sunset flip off the ladder and with the help of Hardy and Finlay, took Lashley to the mat. At 6:00, Flair limped back to the ring to a round of applause. Flair threw a barrage of chops at Shelton and Hardy, then climbed the ladder. Lashley then gave Shelton his finisher. Lashley climbed the ladder, but RVD did a springboard dropkick with a chair into Lashley's back. An ""RVD"" chant broke out. RVD hit a Five-Star Frogsplash off the ladder onto Finlay at 11:00. An ""ECW"" chant broke out. RVD reached for the briefcase. Shelton springboarded onto the ladder from the top rope in a cool spot. They fought on top of the ladder. Harrdy set up another ladder and climbed it. Shelton shifted over to punch him. RVD tipped them over and they both bumped to the floor. RVD then climbed to the very top of the ladder and got the briefcase. On the replay, Hardy's late bump looked pretty harsh.

WINNER: RVD in 12:00.

STAR RATING: ***1/4 -- Good highspot match. Not epic, but a good second match on the card.

JBL vs. CHRIS BENOIT - U.S. Hvt. Title match

WINNER: JBL in 9:00 to win the U.S. Title

STAR RATING: ** -- Okay, but not a particularly ambitious match

EDGE (w/Lita) vs. MICK FOLEY

WINNER: Edge in 15:00.

STAR RATING: ***3/4 -- Good hardcore style match. WWE doesn't do that much hardcore anymore, so it means something. The match built well and didn't waste any stunts without a semblance of selling.

BOOKER T (w/Sharmell) vs. BOOGEYMAN

WINNER: Boogeyman in 5:00.

STAR RATING: neg. * -- Really sloppy, and not enough gross sideshow stuff to make up for it.

TRISH STRATUS vs. MICKEY JAMES -- Women's Title match

WINNER: James in 9:00 to capture the Women's Title.

STAR RATING: ** -- Solid match. The messed up move at the end hurt a little, but good effort and intensity. Mickey stole the show with her facial expressions.

UNDERTAKER vs. MARK HENRY -- Casket Match

STAR RATING: *1/2 -- Not a classic by any means, but thanks to Taker's genuine effort, it was watchable at the least and decent at most.

VINCE MCMAHON vs. SHAWN MICHAELS

WINNER: Michaels in 18:00.

STAR RATING: ***1/2 -- They put on a good show. They protected Vince from doing anything too dangerous without it being obvious. Shane was a valuable addition at ringside, playing his part well. The Shane-Vince ass-kissing was a nice touch.

KURT ANGLE vs. RANDY ORTON vs. REY MYSTERIO -- World Hvt. Title match

WINNER: Rey in 9:00 to capture the World Hvt. Title.

STAR RATING: ***1/4 -- A good rapid-fire three-way match, but disappointingly short. It's also too bad that Mysterio won the title without beating the actual champ and without the crowd 100 percent on his side.

CANDICE MICHELLE vs. TORRIE WILSON - Playboy Pillow Fight

WINNER: Torrie in 4:00.

STAR RATING: n/a -- It went five minutes too long. It felt a lot longer than four minutes. That should be edited out of the DVD.

JOHN CENA vs. TRIPLE H - WWE Hvt. Title match

WINNER: Cena in 21:00 to retain the WWE Hvt. Title.

STAR RATING: **** -- Very good, main event worthy match. The finish, which shocked the crowd, helped end the match on a surprising note.

World Tag Team Chapionship:

The Big Show & Kane (C) vs Carlito & Chris Masters

I was quite supprised with this match. I half expected it to be a dud but it turned out quite good. The Big Show & Kane are still the World Tag Team Champions. 7/10

Money in the Bank Ladder Match:

Rob Van Dam vs Ric Flair vs Shelton Benjamin vs Finlay vs Matt Hardy vs Lashly.

Not quite as good as last years Money in the Bank Match but it was still bloody fantastic. Rob Van Dam is 'Mr Money in the Bank'. 9/10

WWE United States Championship:

Chris Benoit (C) vs John Bradshaw Layfield

Not a bad US title match, but suffered from a dodgy ending. JBL is the new United States Champion. 6/10

Hardcore Match:

Edge(With Lita) vs Mick Foley

Absolutely awsome match from start to finish. The ending was spectacular. Edge wins. 9/10

Booker T vs The Boogeyman:

Here we go, the first crap match of the evening. If you get this on DVD then i suggest you skip this rubbish squash match. The Boogeyman wins. 1/10

WWE Womens Championship:

Trish Status (C) vs Mickie James

A very good womens title match. It was the crowd that made it all the more entertaing, they booed Trish the entire time. Winner and new Womens Champion, Mickie James. 8/10

Casket Match:

The Undertaker vs Mark Henry

Not as bad as i thought it would be, but still slow and dull. The Undertaker wins and is now 14-0 at Wrestlemania. 5/10

No Holds Barred Match:

Shawn Michaels vs Vince McMahon

This was nothing spectacular in terms of a wrestling match, but was still very entertaing none the less. HBK wins. 8/10

Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship:

Ray Mysterio vs Kurt Angle (C) vs Randy Orton

This was a great match, but it was badly booked and way to short. This should have been the main event not John Cena vs Triple H. Winner and new World Heavyweight Champion, Ray Mysterio!!!! 9/10

Playboy Pillow Fight:

Torrie Wilson vs Candice Michelle

Oh my god, this was terrible and how can they put this between the two main events. This match should not have been on the card in the first place. Torrie wins, big deal. 0/10

WWE Championship:

John Cena (C) vs Triple H

WOW, John Cena got booed alot. This match acually turned out to be very good, but i still feel that the main event should have gone to Smackdown and not Raw. John Cena retains the WWE Championship. 9/10

  Good opener. Carlito rules! Youngsters win! That's all I can say! 6/10

2. Money in the Bank 2

  Great match. RVD deserved the briefcase. Nice spot with the falling ladders. 8/10

3. JBL vs. Chris Benoit

  It really pisses me off that JBl, who is a horrible wrestler, gets the title over an excellent technician who deserves alot more respect. Great technician: Benoit. 6.5/10

4. Hardcore Match

  3rd best match of the night. Classic material by Mick Foley and Edge. Nice spot with Mick Foley getting speared through the flaming table. Lita finally gets what she deserves by getting barbed wire in her mouth. 9.5/10

5. Boogeyman vs. Booker T

  2nd worst match of the night. Retarded boogey freak eats worms and makes a disgrace of Mania. 3.5/10

6. Womens Championship

  Good, which is rare for a womens match. Mickey James picks up the win and the psycho gets cheered while Trish gets booed. 6/10

7. Casket Match

  Undertaker SUPRISINGLY wins (sarcasm). 14 to 0 which is no surprise to anybody. Both men need to give up as they are just TOO SLOW! 4.5/10

8. No Holds Barred Match

  The crowds chanting for HBK, and I personally loved to see the Spirit Squad and Vince McMahon get what they deserve. Nice spot at the end however the match should have been better. Overall it was a sloppy squash match with Shawn Michaels doing all the work. Nice to see HBK reliving his DX roots though. 9/10

9. World Heavyweight Championship

  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS! The match was the greatest of the whole night and stupid Triple H and his stupid McMahon family have to make it short to make room for the son in law. Triple H is using nepotism, or for you red necks out there, getting special treatment for being part of Vince's family. Wouldn't it have been better to have this as the main event and in the end see Rey Mysterio hugging Chavo and Vickie and looking at the sky towards Eddie Guerrero. 9.5/10

10. Playboy Pillow Fight

  WHAT THE F*%@ IS THIS, this match does not deserve to be in between the two main events. Unless you are perverted and are looking for something to look at, do not watch this match. 1/10

11. Main Event: Triple H vs. John Cena

  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS, John Cena and the nepotismic Triple H have a very long match that should not have been the main event. The World Heavyweight Championship match was way better than this crap. It is funny to see John Cena get booed by the whole crowd for every punch he throws at Trips. Cena has had the title for a year and does not deserve it as his wrestling sucks. Why not a Raw superstar like Shawn Michaels or RVD get the title because they always put there body on the line, but NOOOO it has to go to the face rapper who needs to turn hell because he gets his a$$ booed from the ring. The Chi-town crowd left the arena pissed off, and so did I. The entrances were longer than the Smackdown match, that just sucks. 7/10",1144195200,2,2947,4.37962962962963

World Tag Team Championship

Kane & Big Show Vs. Carlito & Chris Masters

-This match was not bad. It was better than expected. Kane used some high-flying moves and Carlito carried himself very well. This match was to set up an angle between Carlito and Masters. The match however did have you believe that the ""young lions"" would walk away with the gold, which makes the fallout RAW such a blowout.

All in all solid match, good opener.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match:

-Let's get something straight. RVD is a fantastic wrestler. He has my respect for giving his all in every single match he participates in. BUT that doesn't mean that he can carry the ball for the WWE. J.R once said that ""RVD is the greatest superstar never to be World Champion"" and it should stay that way. Many people will disagree and say that WWE has kept RVD down for too long. I respect him, but from the bottom of my heart I do NOT believe that when the time comes that he can carry the torch for the company(besides Triple H probably won't even let him try).

The match itself was alright and I have to agree that SmackDown is being left in the shadows. OK match, but not as good as the WM 21 one though.

2 on 1 Handicap Match

BoogeyMan Vs. Booker T & Sharmell

-Why do this? Personally I enjoy Booker T's work but the wife angle is so old. Granted they are really married, but so were Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth and we all know how that turned out.

Boogeyman is an alright character. A little of the deep end of the pool nonetheless.

This match, like all the Boogeyman's matches doesn't feature great technical skill, but rather the Boogeyman's weird antics. Cool for SmackDown and their PPVs, but not for WrestleMania.

Squash Match.

U.S Championship

Chris Benoit Vs. JBL

-Right off the bat I'll just say that I'm not a JBL supporter. I don't understand why he is still around. Honestly I damn near fall asleep every time he gets in the ring. The only thing that keeps him going is his interview skills if you ask me.

Benoit is a great wrestler. Great technician.

This match could have been better, but still average. Typical JBL match. Yawn.

Once again JBL has a title. Rip-off. Benoit gets screwed more than Courtney Love on prom-night.

Harcore Match

Edge Vs. Mick Foley

-Great match. A lot of violence. Edge taking the bumps is great. Simple reason. Edge is not a main event guy. He could be though. Back when Edge was doing his thing in 2001 and 2002 I was a big Edge supporter. Why? Because he kept his mouth shut. He didn't talk and just wrestled, which was good. Since his wife stealer angle I believe that Edge has risen to the challenge and performed at a great level. Just don't talk.

This match was great. Great use of weapons. Lita finally gets hers.(Why is she not wrestling?)

Women's Championship

Trish Stratus Vs. Mickie James

-Average match. Not as good as the New Year's Revolution one, but still good. It's good to see a well executed women's match again. Trish and Mickie have great chemistry and great matches.

New champ Mickie James. It should be interesting to see where this goes.

Casket Match

Mark Henry Vs. Undertaker

-Way better than expected. Henry listened to Taker and they had an awesome match. Sadly this match however reminded of WM 11 when Taker took on King Kong Bundy. Why? No real setup, just thrown together so Taker could have a match.

The fact that it was a gimmick match reminded me of the WM 15 Hell in a Cell with Bossman.

Same thing here. WWE knew these two couldn't have a great WM type match normally so they added the Casket.

Great match. 14-0.

No Holds Barred Match

Shawn Michaels Vs. Vince McMahon

-Same concept as the casket match. Not WM quality so let's make it legal for Vince to bleed, because that's the only he's going get noticed for his in ring work(like he needs it).

I enjoyed this match. HBK can still bring out the best in anyone.

World Heavyweight Championship Match

Rey Mysterio Vs. Randy Orton Vs. Kurt Angle

-Out of sight. This match was unbelievable. Great action, awesome moves, and great in-ring competitors.

Then I looked at my watch and wondered two things. Why so short and why the ending?

This match should have been the main event. Royal Rumble winners, hello!

No offense to Rey Mysterio, but the same thing goes for him as for RVD. Can't carry the ball. Think about this. How can the company give the HEAVYWEIGHT title to somebody who doesn't even weigh 200 lbs.? For crying out loud, he can't even hold on to the Cruiserweight title, how is he going hang on to this one when these big guys come after him. We'll see.

All in all, great match. Wrong slot.

Playboy Pillow Fight

Torrie Wilson Vs. Candice Michelle

-WHY?? Why do they do it to us? And why do I read reviews where people give this ""thing"" 10/10. Oh yeah I forgot, because they sit on their couch at home and can't get a date and play pocket pool when the diva's come on. Get a Life of better yet get a girlfriend. JEEZ!!

Shouldn't have appeared on the card. Just skip it.

WWE Championship

John Cena Vs. Triple H

-Two things about this match:

First this is prime example of Triple H's backstage politics. He'll give ya a hell of a show if he gets to go on last. No offense to him. He's great in-ring worker and a hell of an entertainer, but the only reason this match is on last is because Stephanie got her salad tossed earlier.

Second this match was the match of the night. WHY? Because of the story these two told. You remember what stories are? No? I didn't think so. Fans nowadays consider matches with big bumps to be the match of the night. WRONG!

Wait till this DVD comes out and watch this match again. Watch for the story; not the bumps!

Great entrances by both men.

Triple H:

Conan the Barbarian. Why? King of Kings. Ring a bell?

John Cena:

Godfather. Why? Hustle, Loyalty & Respect. Something fans nowadays are lacking majorly.

In closing this WrestleMania was great. Pure and simple. Great! Except for a few things like the Pillow Thing and Handicap match, this DVD will be worth the money. Trust me.",1144108800,3,6330,4.434142114384748

World Tag Team Championships: The Big Show and Kane vs Carlito and Chris masters: Power based match with a few comedic spots, the win here actually breaks Big Show's Wrestlemania losing streak and hints at a split for Carlito and Chris. **

Edge vs Mick Foley: Edge had to pull an increased effort out of his ass to carry Foley, though Foley used every short cut imaginable to make himself look just as good. Edge's intaking of barbed wire to the mouth and arm, Lita taking barbed wire, and Foley getting ripped in two through a burning table convinced me that Vince is an idiot for keeping the title on John Cena, rather than people who have broken their bodies for him for much longer ****/14

Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Rob Van Dam vs Fit Finlay vs Sheltron Benjamen vs Matt Hardy vs Ric Flair vs Bobby Lashly: An excellent interpromotional match with the larger heavyweights staying out of most of the action and paricipating when they can. Flair was the only one to take a high spot, taking a side effect from Hardy. Shelton used dazzling Spider-Man leaps onto ladders, and RVD stole the match with a thunderous van daminator to Hardy on the ladder, and a splash off another ladder to Finlay. RVD picks up the win ****

WWE United States Championship: Chris Benoit vs JBL: A small little match here that begins to get more technical but ends abruptly when JBL rolls up Benoit and wins with his foot on the ropes to pick up the US title. **

Booker T vs The Boogeyman Short squash, does nothing for either DUD

WWE Women's Championship: Trish Stratus vs Mickie James: A back and fourth match that contained many hard hitting and aggresive moments from both individuals, but also carried some embrassing mistimed moves and botches, particulary with the finish, Mickie misses the Stratusfaction counter into her own, and slips, so she has to chick kick Trish to pick up the title. The crowd, loving the Mickie James angle, ate Mickie up and booed the long reigning face Stratus out of the building. ***

Shawn Micheals vs Vince Mcmahon: Shawn and Vince pulled off a great no holds barred match, but it's greatest strength was not in Vince's full time participation, but his allowing Shawn to completly show off to the crowd, murdering the chiarman with every dirty trick HBK has used in his Attitude days. Shawn fought off the forces of the Spirit Squad and Shane Mcmahon to dazzle the crowd with an elbow drop atop a gigantic ladder onto a prone Mcmahon, followed by a savage kick for the win. **** for the scale of entertainment, proving you don't need to be a technical classic to be memorable.

The Undertaker vs Mark Henry: Worthless match, although 'Taker's leap over the cakset and tombstone to Henry were impressive. Give this guy another run for the belt, he's wasted on guys like Henry **

World Heavyweight Championship: Kurt Angle vs Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton: Well, against their intial booking schedules, WWE decided to go ahead and give a cruserweight the world title, making the possibilities of Batista/Mysterio look too easy to comprehend. Expect a short reign from Mysterio, as this was clearly to honour, again, the memory of a far more talented individual, Eddie Guerrero. The match itself was short, almsot embarrasingly short, but did not carry enough action to rival the triple threats seen on recent TNA PPVS courtesy of AJ Styles, Smaoa Joe, and Christopher Daniels.

WWE Championship: John Cena vs Triple H: Again, the reason people are booing Cena is because no matter how much he's pushed as a face, his limited moveset, boring promos, utter complaicency, and ""Rap"" gimmick persona (or rather a watered down version of it) continue to drag him down to embarrasing levels. Triple H and Cena's entrances for this match were spectacular, and the crowd was completly in favour of the superior worker, Hunter. The crowd countered any calls for Cena with ""F-YOU CENA"", and even when Cena ""proved"" he could beat the ten time former champion, Hunter had already exposed him as a five move wonder after twenty minutes of action. Cena's final STFU was made to look completly unconvincing and Hunter's tapout almost came off as a fluke victory for the champion, making Cena look worse as the show quickly ended.

2529502,3,B000EQ5PUA,"Okay, first of all, unlike many people, I had fairly high expectations about this PPV going in. It looked to be a solid card with several matches I was excited about seeing. Ladder match looked good, hardcore match I knew would deliver, and Angle/Orton/Mysterio I thought would tear the house down. I was also intrigued to see how HHH/Cena would play out as they have never faced each other...and HBK/Vince had a long storyline to it, and perhaps some surprises and uniqueness to it. After the first 2 hours or so, the show was looking real good. The ladder match was great, though it was mainly about the RAW guys and Lashley really should have been in a one-on-one match against a credible heel if they wanted to build him up as a future star. There were three or four guys more over than him, and Smackdown was basically buried here. Still, the right guy won and it about time that RVD be allowed to shine. Hardcore match did everything right, putting over Edge as a deserved main-eventer while also giving Foley a special and unforgettable Wrestlemania match. Match of the night. With a decent US Title match, unexpectedly good women's title match, and entertaining Casket match, this was playing out well and the main event matches were yet to come...but it all fell apart in the final hour or so.

The order and execution of the final four matches went against everything that should have been done to make this show work, and many people are disappointed as a result. I know it may be too much to ask, but I really hope WWE takes a good look at the reactions of their fans and look at where their own priorities lie, and why the egos of the McMahons and Triple H ruined this show. Though I personally can't buy Mysterio as HEAVYWEIGHT champ (he's 160 lbs!!), It would have made perfect sense to end the show with the ""emotional high"" of him winning it for Eddie and send the fans home happy. Even if the ending of HHH/Cena was the same, if you end the show with the Smackdown main event you can minimize the damage of the disappointing ending (in many fan's eyes) of Cena winning. It would be a fitting and special Wrestlemania moment to see Mysterio embracing Chavo and Vickie in the ring as the show goes off the air...but of course WWE did the complete opposite of this and left the crowd in stunned silence and anger, shaking their heads with disgust as they left the arena. And Smackdown was further buried by having their main event cut to 9 MINUTES, and the crowd was completely lost with the embarrassing pillow fight that split up the main events. I can't tell you how mad I was to see Smackdown get such a short match when you have 4 HOURS to give them enough time (10 more minutes even!) to steal the show. But of course Triple H wouldn't have that. And the pillow fight was simply embarrassing (even by pillow fight standards) and took the crowd out of it at the worst possible time. McMahon/Michaels match didn't give us anything that we haven't seen a million times on RAW. Hasn't the stupid spirit squad beaten up Michaels on RAW already ....and why exactly did Shawn have to revert back to his ""edgier"" DX days to beat a 60 year old non-wrestler... and if Shane was there, why wasn't it Shane vs. Shawn here instead of at SNME, it would have been a MUCH better match. The only thing that saved this from being a total waste of time was the ladder spot at the end, but even that took too long to set up and was simply a ""big spot"" that was unnecessary to the match to keep it from sucking. It was as if Michaels was thinking to himself, ""This match can't end yet. I gotta do something big so this match doesn't suck anymore. This is Wrestlemania, dammit! I gotta pull some kind of big move off before I pin this guy or else nobody will remember this thing.""

It was one sided and came across as flat and unoriginal and was simply a spot fest and anticlimactic. In fact, the whole end of the show was anticlimactic as Rey's title win should have been the lasting impression to end on.

I could go on and on about how poorly planned and executed these final matches were, and how sad it is that great wrestlers like Angle/Orton/Mysterio/Booker T (the Boogeyman squash was just sad)/Benoit have to be put aside because of the egos of HHH and McMahons. The Smackdown main event had the potential to be show stealer, match of the year material but it wasn't even allowed to go on as long as the RAW main event lame entrances did. If they had brought Cena out with the world champion White Sox holding the trophy over his head, he still would have been booed out of the building during the match the same way that he was....and this guy is your top face and future of the company??? Your Wrestlemania main event?? The order of the final matches should have been: McMahon/Michaels...Taker/Henry...HHH/Cena....Angle/Orton/Mysterio. But instead, the Smackdown brand was shoved into the casket along with Mark Henry, and the final hour of this show destroyed what started out as and could have been one of the best PPVs in a long while. Like I said, WWE should really take a long look at what went wrong here, or else a lot of ""die hard"" fans like myself will begin to grow tired of seeing the guys who deserve to steal the show be buried and out promoted by those who leave us disappointed and tired of the same old thing.",1144022400,16,5335,4.452965235173824

Kane & Big Show vs Carlito & Chris Masters

I kind of guessed Show and Kane would win this. Basic opener

5/10

Raw vs. Smackdown Money in the bank Ladder match

RVD vs Shelton vs Flair vs Lashley vs Hardy vs Finlay

Better than last years. This time it's interpromotional. RVD wins it. Good showing by all competitors (9/10)

United States Championship

Chris Benoit vs JBL

WHY DID BENOIT LOSE THE TITLE. I HATE GAY-B-L. JBL wins by grabbing the ropes.  (6/10)

Hardcore match

Edge vs Mick Foley

THIS IS THE BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT. There is no winners in this match. Only survivors. Edge's best WM match. Foley did all he can and put on this hell of a show. (10/10)

Booker T & Sharmell vs The Boogeyman

This is pretty much a sideshow. Not that it sucked. But I'm glad Boogey finally shut Booker up. (4/10)

WWE Women's Championship

Mickey James vs. Trish Stratus

Pretty desient Women's title match. Ususally these are wastes of time but ok. Mickey wins it. (7/10)

Casket Match

Undertaker vs Mark Henry

THANK GOD HENRY DIDN'T WIN. Why is he even getting these matches. Thank god taker's record didn't get demolished by this stupid pointless wrestler. (10/10)

No holds barred match

Shawn Michaels vs Vince McMahon

2nd Best Match of the night. Vince's better match than HOGAN/McMAHON at WM XIX. My favorite part is when Shawn did the DX Chop. (10/10)

World Heavyweight Championship

Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton vs. Kurt Angle (c)

REY REY WINS IT. I was kind of hoping Angle would have retained it. Orton is just stupid. Just like 2 years ago when Benoit won the title Rey did the same. Great Job Rey. This was not a bad Triple Threat. Angle tryed but just couldn't win it this time. (10/10)

Playboy pillow fight

Torrie Wilson vs Candice Michelle

Bathroom Break Match. Pointless and stupid. Torrie wins. If your a man you'll love this match. if your a wrestling fan skip to the next match. (-10/10)

WWE Championship

Triple H vs John Cena

Here's the thing I don't get. The Chitown crowd was booing Cena the whole time and everyone on this review site is saying Cena shouldn't hold the title. In my opinion I think Cena should hold that title. Great Match. Crowd cheering Trips and jeering Cena. Cena wins with the STFU to become the 6 man to retain the WWE Championship.

Big Show & Kane(champions) vs Chris Masters & Carlito

 Nice Tag Team Championship match, the best one I've seen in a long time.

Surprisingly there was some high risk offense from Kane. Crowd seemed to be

into Carlito. Kane wins after the chokeslam on Carlito. Masters & Carlito have

some words after the match.

Money In The Bank Interpromotional Match  10/10

Matt Hardy vs Shelton Benjamin vs RVD vs Ric Flair vs Finlay vs Lashley

 This match was AWESOME. There was alot of high risks moves in

this Ladder Match. Flair gets hurt in like the first 3 minutes of the match

and gets take to the back only to return a couple of minutes later. There is

alot of ""ECW"" chants. Sweet moment when Benjamin leap frogs from the

ropes onto the Ladder. Rob Van Dam picks up the win after he knocks Hardy

and Benjamin off the Ladder.

WWE U.S Championship  7/10

Chris Benoit(champion) vs John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield

 This was a very hard hitting match up. JBL gets alot of heat for using

Eddie Guerrero's moves. JBL cheats by holding the ropes to beat Benoit and

win the U.S Championship.

Hardcore Match  10/10

Edge w/Lita vs Mick Foley

 Three words....OH MY GOD...This match was BRUTAL and Lita

looked smoking hot in her outfit. After seeing this match, I think that Vince

should bring back the Hardcore Title (I missed those matches). In this

match between The Hardcore Legend and The Rated R Superstar, we saw

them use tables, chairs, cookie sheets, barbed wire, road signs & thumbtacks.

Heck, Socko even went hardcore when he got wrapped in barbed wire.

AWESOME moment when Edge speared Foley through the ropes through

a flaming table on the outside to pick up the win.....Match of the Night in

my opinion.

Handicap Match  5/10

Booker T & Sharmell vs The Boogeyman

 Short match. The Boogeyman is very sloppy. Boogeyman wins

after a modified Baldo Bomb on Booker T.

WWE Women's Championship Match  6/10

Trish Stratus(champion) vs Mickie James

 This was a hard hitting Woman's match. Trish is heavily booed for

some reason. This is probably the best Woman's match at Wrestlemania

to date. Mickie wins after a chick kick on Trish.

Casket Match  8/10

The Undertaker vs Mark Henry

 Pretty good match. The Undertaker delivers an awesome dive

over the top rope and the casket onto Mark Henry. Taker then gives

Henry the Tombstone Piledriver and then puts him in the Casket and

wins. Taker is now 14-0.

No Holds Barred Match  10/10

Vince McMahon vs Shawn Michaels

 This match is very entertaining and has alot of interference

from The Spirit Squad  & Shane McMahon. Theres a cool moment when

Shawn throws one member of the Spirit Squad onto the rest of the members

who are outside of the ring. This was an awesome match. Shawn basically

beat the crap out of the Chairman. There was an awesome table spot when

HBK jumped off a 20 ft ladder delivering an elbow into the black heart

of the Chairman and putting him through a table. Shawn wins after a Sweet

Chin Music. Vince gives him the finger as he is being stretchered away.

World Heavyweight Championship Match  9/10

Kurt Angle(champion) vs Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton

 Cool spot when they do a double german suplex and Rey goes flying.

Angle is on fire in the beginning of the match. It was a great match, but it was

was too short. I don't even think it reached the 10 minute mark. But it was

good while it lasted. Rey won after a 619 and West Coast Pop on Orton.

Playboy Pillow Fight  4/10

Torrie Wilson vs Candice Michelle

 Both girls looked really really hot. I wish this would have been a

replaced with a Cruiserweight match, but oh well. This match got some

""Boring"" chants. Torrie won with a roll up. I have no clue why they called

it a pillow fight, because they never used the pillows, lol.

WWE Championship  8/10

John Cena(champion) vs Triple H

 The beginning of this match confused me, because of the entrances with

the gang members and everything. Triple H's entrance last year was way cooler

than the one this year....he looked like an idiot in that outfit. Triple H is the man

and i'm glad everyone booed Cena, because he's a sorry champion. He was

cooler when he was a heel and actually rapped and did his gimmick well. The

guy needs to get some wrestling skills. And people were chanting ""You Can't

Wrestle"" at him as well, lol. He'll probably become cool again once he

becomes a heel again like he was in 2003 when he was actually rapping like

everynight. Now I think i've only heard him rap like 5 times over the last 2 t0

3 years. But like I said, the crowd was into seeing Cena getting beat down. In

my opinion, Triple H carried Cena the whole match....(doesn't everybody

carry Cena). Cena is definitely not the next Tripl H, Stone Cold, The Rock,

Hulk Hogan, Breat Hart or Kurt Angle and he'll never be as popular or over as

they were. It was a pretty decent match though. Its total B.S that Triple H lost.

I just hope that after Cena loses the title, that he never wins it back because

he is a sorry champion.

Overall, this WrestleMania  has been the best WrestleMania since

WrestleMania 17 in 2001. I would reccommend any wrestling fan to buy

this PPV for the Ladder Match, Hardcore Match, No Holds Barred Match,

Triple Threat Match & WWE Championship match.

World Tag Team Championship

Kane & Big Show vs Carlito & Chris Masters

-This one was just a regular tag match. I was expecting that carlito and masters screwed the champs, but it did not happened. (6/10)

Money in the bank Ladder match

RVD vs Shelton vs Flair vs Lashley vs Hardy vs Finlay

Are you kidding me? This match was the worst ladder match ever. There wasn't a lot of spectacularity. Some good moves include a side effect, the spalsh form the ladder, and the superplex form the ladder. WM21's ladder match was better. (2/10)

United States Championship

Chris Benoit vs JBL

This match was pretty entertaining. Benoit did not deserve to lose the title that way. bradhsaw countered the crossface into a pinfall, and he grabbed the ropes! (7/10)

Hardcore match

Edge vs Mick Foley

The best match of the night! A lot of barbe wire, and other weapons. Too bad edge won. Sweet ending with edge spearing foley throught the ropes and landing into a table on fire! (10/10)

Booker T & Sharmell vs The Boogeyman

Very regular match, and predictable ending. Booker mist the scissors kick, and boogeyman kissed sharmell with his mouth full of worms. (5/10)

WWE Women's Championship

Trish Stratus vs Mickie James

What amatch. Everybody cheered for Mickie, and it was time for trish to drop. Mickie is so hot! (8/10)

Casket Match

Undertaker vs Mark Henry

It wasn't the greates casket match, but it was ok! No daivari. The best parts were the undertjer flying over the top rope, the last ride, and the tombstone. 14-0 for taker. (8/10)

No holds barred match

Shawn Michaels vs Vince McMahon

We all were not expecting a good one-on-one match, but a beatibg to mcmahon. HBK took the whole spirit squad out, and he took shane out too. Love to see HBk with the dx style again, and the elbow drop fromthe ladder was awesome. (8/10)

World Heavyweight Championship

Kurt Angle vs Randy orton vs Rey Mysterio

Angle got screwed on this one. He had both rey and orton tapping, but the referee did not see it. Very good match, but the end was bad. Rey is the new champ, and angle was screwed! (8/10)

Torrie Wilson vs Candice Michelle

Surprise ending with torrie winnig. I thought wwe would keep pushing candice. Love to see lingerie. (5/10) for the match, and (100000000/10) foor the girls!

WWE Championship

Triple H vs John Cena

Cena retains, and that sux. The match was great. Triple H did not tap to the first STFU, and he kicked out of the FU. He hit cena with the sledge, but it didn't work. The game tapped the second time! CENA NEEDS TO DROP, EVERYBODY WAS BOOING HIM! (9/10)

2529506,5,B000EQ5PUA,"Wrestlemania 22 had some great matches, and some horrible matches. Mick Foley returned as Cactus Jack, Chris Benoit lost the US title, John Cena made Triple H tap out, and The Undertaker continued his undefeated streak by beating Mark Henry.

World Tag Team Championships

Big Show and Kane [Champions] vs. Carlito and Chris Masters:

Okay match to start the show. Big Show used a lot of big man moves and Kane even did a drop kick and jumped off the top turnbuckles to Masters and Carlito on the outside. Masters came off the turnbuckles but hit Carlito by accident and Kane gave a chokeslam to Carlito to retain the titles. 7/10

Money In The Bank Ladder Match

Rob Van Dam vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Lashley vs. Finlay vs. Ric Flair vs. Matt Hardy:

Awesome ladder match. Flair gets superplexed off a ladder and had to leave temporairily. Rob Van Dam hit a splash off the top of a ladder onto Finlay. Shelton jumped off a ladder to the outside onto two or three guys. RVD hit a missile drop kick to lashley on a ladder. Ric Flair comes back in but Finlay hit him with his club while Flair touched the briefcase. The end comes when Shelton Benjamin and Matt Hardy fall of a ladder to the outside and Rob Van Dam wins the match. 9/10

USA Championship

Chris Benoit [Champion] vs. JBL:

To be honest I was surprised to see JBL use a sleeper hold in this match. It was hard hitting in some places and JBL even had the audacity to mock Eddie Guerrero multiple times in the match. The end comes when Benoit had JBL in the cross face but JBL rolls over and grabs the ropes to pin Benoit. 7/10 [These two have had better matches]

Hardcore Match

Mick Foley vs. Edge:

Great match. Edge spears Mick only to have Mick take off an extra flannel shirt to reveal himself as Cactus Jack wrapped in Barb Wire! Kendo sticks, street signs, tables, thumbtacks, lighter fluid, and a barbed wire baseball bat all make appearances. Highlights include Cactus Jack back suplexing Edge onto a pile of tacks. Edge gave some massive shots to Mick with a cookie sheet and street signs. The end comes when Edge speared Mick through the middle ropes onto a FLAMING table!!!! Edge wins. 9/10 Brutal match and a must see ending.

Handicap Match

Booker T and Sharmell vs. The Boogeyman:

Blah, boring and worthless. Boogeyman kisses Sharmell with a mouthful of worms and she flips out. Boogeyman gets a pin. 5/10

Women's Championship

Trish Stratus [Champion] vs. Mickie James:

This was actually a pretty good match and the crowd was really into Mickie. Trish kicks a ring post by accident after Mickie moved out of the way. Both women are hot and can actually wrestle, which is nice to see on a ppv for a change. Mickie botched the ending when she went for Trish's own move but hits the chick kick on Trish to win the Women's Championship. 6.5/10

No Holds Barred Match

Shawn Michales vs. Mr. McMahon:

Entertaining all the way through. The Spirit Squad beats up Shawn but HBK fights back and nails everyone of them with the mega-phone, Shane McMahon hits the ring with a kendo stick but Shawn forces Shane to kiss his own father's ass without Vice realizing who is actually kissing it! HBK handcuffs Shane to the ring ropes and then proceeds to beat the hell out of both McMahons, payback for the last four months of hell! The ending comes when Shawn gives a HUGE elbow drop onto Mr. McMahon off a 25 foot ladder through a table! 9.5/10 Great match and definately a WM moment.

Casket Match

The undertaker vs. Mark Henry:

I think this was Undertaker's worst WM match in quite some time. Some cool moves though as Undertaker leaps over the top rope, over the casket, onto Henry. Both men get their faces shoved into steel steps and both even end up fighting literally inside the casket. The ending comes when UT gives Mark Henry an impressive tombestone and roll him into the casket. 14-0 is UT's new record. 7/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple Threat Match

Randy Orton vs. Kurt Angle [Champion] vs. Rey Mysterio:

Great match but about half as long as I thought it would be. Very fast paced though and some cool moments such as; Angle german suplexing Randy Orton who suplexes Rey Mysterio at the same time. Angle makes both Orton and Mysterio tap out but each time the ref was distracted by the other man. The end comes when Angle is thrown out of the ring and Rey hits the 619 and the west coast pop on Orton to win the title. 9/10 Great match but only 10 or 12 mintues long!

Playboy Pillow Fight

Torrie Wilson vs. Candice Michelle:

I think the crowd chanting, ""Boring"" sums it all up. 1/10 [for the outfits]

WWE Championship

Triple H vs. John Cena [Champion]:

This was actually a pretty good match. The entire crowd booed the hell out of Cena as both men actually wrestled and brawled all over the ring area. Highlights include some viscious clotheslines by Triple H and Cena on each other, and Cena back dropping the Game onto the entrance ramp. Both men kick out of the other's finishing moves but Cena gets the win after making Triple H tap out to the STFU. 8.5/10

Not only this was one of the lamest wrestlemanias, but the main event was funny as hell. The crowd were chanting ""f'ck u cena!"" and they booed all his moves and he still keeps on winning!

TNA is exciting, action packed and has storylines that build up and don't let you down.  If you look at the roster and say they are a bunch of WWE hasbeens or Independent losers then your mistaken. These guys can still put on a show.  You can't judge the TNA wrestling roster by its no names or hasbeens. Raven can still put on a show. Rhino still delivers the gore with excitment. The James Gang aka New Age Outlaws bring back the attitude. Jeff Jarret is the ultimate bad guy. AJ Styles is an awesome performer and future TNA Hall of Famer. Petey Williams' Canadian Destroyer is a finishing move that is unparrelled in the sport (What pedigree?). Christian is the shining star main eventer that he was meant to be.  Sonjay Dutt is the Rey Misterio Jr. of the next generation. I can go on and on...this roster is unbelievable! Wrestlemania 22 is for those who are scared to change to a new product because they've been brainwashed to believe that WWE is the best and only organization with talent. I was a long time WWE fan...I cheered when Hogan slammed Andre, was amazed when the Hitman and Mr. Perfect had one of greatest matches of all-time at Summerslam 91, the ladder match at Wrestlemania X had me jumping on the couch wishing I could be a pro wrestler and I even cracked a smile when Shane appeared at Nitro without father, Vince, knowing it (according to storylines anyway).  But that just it there's no more fire anymore.  TNA, on the other hand, is flame that is smoldering with excitment!  Mark Henry is suppose to end the Undertaker's streak, Triple H has lost his fire and he's gonna be champ again, we couldn't leave it Angle vs. Misterio we had to throw in Orton and for those who think that they're gonna see some [...]lets throw in Candice vs. Torrie and we'll call it...a...a ""Playboy Pillow Fight""...yeah that's it, that will sell.

EXTRA COMMENTS

It doesn't look like MNM will be defending their WWE TAG TITLES on the show but they should be! they deserve that spot!

Although I see an MNM appearabnce on that show! They've been too big a part of SMACKDOWN! not to at least do some sort of segment on that show!

Also I definately see Batista being on that show! He will have some sort of segment or do a run in on one of the two heavyweight title matches!

I see Randy Orton winning the WORLD TITLE and going after Cena during the WWE TITLE match!

I'd be very very shocked to see The Rock on that show! That won't happen!

As for Hulk Hogan there is a slight chance of him being on that show!

Stone Cold Steve Austin has a better chance of appearing on the show than Rock or Hogan!

An Austin & Hogan segment and staredown would be awesome!!!

Bret Hart won't be at Wrestlemania 22! He will be at the Hall of Fame Ceremony and that's it! Straight fom The Hitman himself! Lets just hope he doesn't see Shawn! He said in a recent interview he would leave if he even saw him!

BRET HART SHOULD BE REMEMBERED FOR HIS WWE CAREER! GOOD TO SEE HIM IN THE HALL OF FAME!

GLAD TO SEE EDDIE GUERRERO IN THE HALL OF FAME HE HAS A LEGEND NOT JUST WITH HIS FAMOUS SURNAME BUT HIS JAPAN, ECW, WCW AND ECW & WWE CAREER! AND ON TOP OF THAT HE ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS A MAIN EVENTER IN WWE! IF YOU DIDN'T SEE HIS RUN HE WAS THE MOST OVER WWE CHAMPS SINCE THE ROCK! HE HAD TECHNICAL SKILL! AND DEVELOPED SOME GREAT CHARISMA WITH THAT LIE, CHEAT, STEAL CHARACTER! AND THAT HEEL RUN TOWARDS THE END WAS SUCCESSFUL! HE TURNED FROM THE BIGGEST BABY FACE TO A STRONG HEEL! EDDIE COULD DO THAT! MASTER OF RING PSYCHOLOGY!

EDDIE SHOULD BE REMEMBERED AS A GREAT WWE CHAMP!

VIVA LA RAZA! ADOLE!

HEAVEN IS A LOW RIDER! REST IN PEACE VATO!

WWE DRAFT 2006 (STARTS AFTER MANIA!)

The Draft is very difficult too predict this year! I see Randy Orton coming back to RAW, I see MYSTERIO staying on SMACKDOWN! Batista may come back to RAW 50/50, MNM will probably come to RAW! ANGLE will probably stay on SMACKDOWN! HHH and HBK the A STARS will stay on the A SHOW RAW! [WWE OFFICE OPINION, I LIKE SMACKDOWN BETTER THAN RAW OFTEN BUT IT'S OBVIOUS RAW IS WWE's PRIORITY! CASE & POINT FOLEY, HOGAN, AUSTIN & ROCK ON RAW ROSTER THE BIG STRS ON THE BIG SHOW! ORTON LAST YEAR SENT TO SMACKDOWN TO BECOME A BIGGER STAR!]

I THINK MY PREDICTIONS ARE GOOD! MAY NOT BE DEAD ON! WRESTLEMANIA 22 WILL BE A STRONG SHOW! NOT QUITE ON THE LEVEL OF MANIA 21 UNDERCARD BUT THE 2 TITLE MATCHES WILL BE BETTER!

THEY MAY GO WITH A MOMENT LIKE MANIA 20 WITH REY & MAYBE BATISTA CELEBRATING!

THEY WON'T BE A STRONG LESNAR vs. ANGLE WRESTLING MAIN EVENT!

THEY WON'T BE A ROCK vs. HOGAN STAR POWERED MAIN EVENT!

CENA vs. HHH NOT QUITE THE SAME!

AND THIS MANIA WON'T TOUCH MY FAVOURITE MANIA, MANIA 17!

ROCK vs. AUSTIN! GREATEST BUILT STORY! GREATEST STAR POWERED MAIN EVENT EVER!!!

WRESTLEMANIA 22 - SHOULD BE A 4 STAR SHOW!

P.S ANYONE KNOW IF THEY WILL SHOW THE HALL OF FAME CEREMONY LIVE IN THE UK? COULDN'T FIND IT IN SKY LISTINGS! CAN WE WATCH THE START OF THE CERMONY ON WWE.COM OR WILL IT BE REGION BARRED FOR UK USERS? IS THERE A LIVE HEAT BEFORE MANIA? WILL UK GET IT?

BY THE WAY TNA SUCKS! TRY BUILDING SOME CHARACTERS! BY THE WAY AJ STYLES YOU PIECE OF TRAILER PARK TRASH, LISTEN TO BATISTA! TELL A STORY IN THE RING! SLOW DOWN! DON'T JUST GO FOR CRAZY FLYING SPOTS! SURE BATISTA JUST KNOWS HAD TO DO A SPINEBUSTER AND A SIT-DOWN POWERBOMB BUT HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKIN ABOUT! HHH AND FLAIR HAVE TAUGHT HIM SOME RING PSYCHOLOGY!

I KINDA LIKE TNA! IT DOESN'T TOTALLY SUCK! BUT THEY HAVE A FAIR WAY TO GO! AND THEY NEED TO MOVE OUT THAT TINY ORLANDO ARENA! TNA WRESTLERS WOULDN'T GET ANY OF THOSE LARGE OVATIONS IN A LARGE WWE ARENA!

Champion: Kurt Angle Vs Randy Orton Vs Rey Mysterio Jr.
WINNER and NEW CHAMPION : Rey Mysterio Jr.

WWE Heavyweight Championship Match
Champion: Edge w/ Lita Vs John Cena
I would have made it that Cena never received a return match since New Year's Revolution with Edge dodging him every chance he got and figuring out ways of avoiding Cena. Like a no return match clause in his Money in the bank contract. With Edge wrestling Nature Boy Ric Flair in a Ladder Match at the Royal Rumble instead of Cena. However, Cena goes over cleanly on HHH in the finals of the Road to Wrestlemania tournament.
WINNER and NEW CHAMPION: John Cena

The King of Kings Vs The Wrestling Gawdd!
HHH Vs JBL w/ Jillian Hall
I like continuity with Wrestlemanias for example Wrestlemania V and VI it's something lost in the current era of the performers going in and out of kayfabe and monthly PPV's. I like the idea of this match based on Mic alone. They can run each other down because JBL held the title for ten months while HHH has lost the belt ten times. It's Mr. RAW Vs Mr. Smackdown!
WINNER: Triple H

Champions: MNM w/ Melina Vs The Rockers
I hate, hate hate the way MNM loses every week on Smackdown. They are the most over and heat generating tag team in recent memory, and yet the McMahonagement feel the need to use to get single stars over. Scenario: MNM with help from Shane McMahon eliminate Shawn Michaels at the Royal Rumble and Melina shows up the next night on RAW and persuades to grant her a favor. Weeks go by and the favor is unrevealed with only Melina making appearances on RAW. Then it is revealed that it was Melina who orchestrated the rehiring of Marty Jannetty so MNM can make a name for themselves at Wrestlemania when MNM defeats The Rockers! Lots of run-in for this match by the McMahons and Sensational Sherri coming down to escort Melina away from ringside.
WINNERS and NEW CHAMPIONS: The Rockers

The Undertaker Vs Chris Benoit
Chris Benoit turn heels and gets jealous of the Undertaker only making apperances as he sees fit when Chris Benoit had to defend the United States Championship injured at No Way Out.
WINNER: The Undertaker

WWE Women's Championship Match
Champion Trish Stratus Vs Mickie James
WINNER and NEW CHAMPION: Mickie James

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
RVD Vs Carlito Vs Shelton Benjamin Vs Booker T Vs Gregory Helms Vs Matt Hardy

1. World Tag Team Title Match Big Show & Kane vs Carlito & Chris Masters 7/10 Pretty decent opener with kane showing his athletic ability because is wm this match had a nice pace with 4 good superstars.

2. Moneyin the Bank Ladder Match Finley vs Hardy vs Lashley vs Shelton vs Flair vs RVD 8.5/10 Great match but not as good as last year flair shows tremendous heart shelton shows his great ability once again RVD is no stranger to ladder matches so is hardy finley was decent but lashley showing great inexperience you'll see but overall great.

3. United States Title Match JBL vs Chris Benoit 6/10 an ok bout cheap ending and really no good build up for this

4. Hardcore Grudge Match Mick Foley vs Edge MATCH OF THE NIGHT!!! 10/10 Simply AWESOME! nice fast paced hardcore brawl no slow spots just great could have been longer but one of the greatest finishes to a match ever!

5. Handicap Match Booker T & Sharmell vs The Boogeyman 2/10 Boring sucked skip skip skip.

6. Women's Title Match Trish Stratus vs Mickie James 8.5/10 Greatest Women's Match Of All Time Nuff Said

7. Casket Match Mark Henry vs Undertaker 5/10 Sucked taker tried his best to make henry look good only 1 highlight in this match otherwise boring.

8. No Holds Barred MR. MCMAHON vs HBK Shawn Michaels 8/10 Fun Match to watch

9. World Heavyweight Title Triple Threat Match 9/10 Fast paced action 3 different styles clashed here dissapointing ending for two reasons: 1. The Winner 2. The Match Length and this was supposed to be the main event it's april and the rumble is already forgotten

10. Playboy pillow fight Candice vs Torrie 0/10 skip skip filler filler I watched a little but i left out and i noticed when i came back the crowd was dead.

11. WWE Title Match Triple H vs John Cena(not supposed to be the main event) 8/10 Not that good and is already overrated my ears were bleeding everybody was loud for this match except for me just a decent bout not main event worthy and for every body who loved this match mute this and rock vs hogan and see how good the match is. stupid finish but i stayed there to the end and cena and hhh were getting booed when they left people were cussing pissed off get serious guys please it's alot of things going on in the world worser than this.

2529523,4,B000EQ5PUA,"In my opinion, Wrestlemania 22 was a very entertaining paperview. heres the matches and my ratings:

1. world tag titles kane and big show vs. carlito & masters (8.5/10). i enjoyed this match. i wasn't expecting it to be this good but it was. kane showed great athleticism in this match. not too long and not too short. winners=kane and big show.

2. MITB ladder match flairvs.rvd.lashleyvs.finlayvs.hardyvs.benjamin(9.5/10)

awesome match! last years might have been a bit better but it was awesome anyway. shelton was agina awesome and hardy and rvd were very good too. right guy won winner=rvd.

3. u.s title benoit vs. jbl (8.5/10). solid match with goiod mat wrestling. i expected this to be a little bit better but it was still good. jbl needs to lose some weight because he looks horrible out there. winner= jbl.

4. hardcore match foley vs. edge (10/10). great hardcore match. both men took punishment especially foley. he was bleeding like a pig. barbed wire, road signs, steel steps, basbeall bats in barbde wire, tacs, and a table on fire. edge does awesome spear threw ropes to foley throught the table on fire. barbed wire socko was cool 2. winner=edge.

5. boogeyman vs. booker t and sharmell (5/10). this was a bad, short match. waste of time in my eyes. booker t loooked good and deserved a better match cuz hes a good wreslter. boogeyman looked so lost out there. winner=boogeyman.

6. womens championship trish vs. mickie james. (8/10). one of the better womens matches ive seen. there was even submissions used in this match. winner=mickie james.

7. casket match mark henry vs. undertaker (8.5/10). not the bets casket match but it was very solid. mark henry was too dominant in teh beginning. awesome dive by taker over the ropes and the casket onto henry. last ride off ropes and tombstone. winner=undertaker 14-0 at WM.

8. no holds barred shawn macheals vs. mr mcmahon.(9.5/10). i wasn't expecting this match to be this good. vince even looked good out there. interfernce from shane and spirit squad. awesome elbow by michaels off a huge ladder onto vince who was on a table with a trash can on his head. sweet chin music and its over winner=shawn michaels

9. world heavywight championship angle vs. orton vs. mysterio (9/10). only problem was that it was only about 12 minutes long. good match otherwise with some good moves. double suplex to rey and orton was awesome. rey proly won't be champ for long maybe a month winner=rey mysterio.

10. playboy pillow fight (4/10). waste of time. both girls looked great thoguh. WHY WOULD THEY HAVE THIS IN BETWEEN THE 2 CHAMPIONSHIP MATCHES! i didn't get the point of this match other thatn to cool the crowd down for the wwe championship.

11. wwe championship cena vs. HHH (9/10). great wrestling macth. I wasn't looking forward to this match but they delivered. i havnet seen fans into a match as much as this since hogan vs. rock 4 years ago. i think the crowd helped this match because they were always into it. there was a lot of hard hitting moves with near falls and back and forth action. wrong guy won thoguh. don't worry people cena will lose the title at backlash in the rematch to HHH. winner= john cena.

overall, i enjoyed tis wresltemania. i think it was better than WM 21 and wrestlemania 20. out of 110 becasue of the 11 matches this paperview scored 89.5/110 . thats a 81% which is a very good score. i would recommend buying this dvd. other than the 2 bad matches everything else is great. theres also some backstage stuff that was pretty funny.",1141516800,,3533,4.715909090909091
