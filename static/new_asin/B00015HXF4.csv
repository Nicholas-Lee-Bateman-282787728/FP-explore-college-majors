1972184,4,B00015HXF4,"This BBC/ Discovery  Channel show is in 3 parts (Joseph; Joshua; David), and all are very well

produced, with good re-enactments, computer simulations, location shots and the advice of the

most relevant experts worldwide.

""Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors"" is the weakest of the 3 parts, despite its very good

production quality, because the existing knowledge of Joseph is poor, being totally without

agreement amongst the experts, and with no hard evidence. Hence this Joseph part goes off

in many well-produced tangents without coming up with any acceptable outcome. It seems

to adopt assumptions, such as the date when Joseph actually lived, which is certainly not

well agreed upon; and other ambiguous notions are put forward. The final flaw is that the

""new-age"" author David Rohl is put in amongst expert guests; his credibility is mainly based

on his book, which is of rather doubtful historical accuracy or academic value.

""Joshua and the Walls of Jerico"" is next, and is a much more coherent work, which culminates

in a firm, reliable conclusion. But be warned: this is not a children's retelling or a documentary

for fundamentalists, since this ruthlessly critical view of the Biblical account strips away the

traditions to reveal a rather bare, even miserable historical basis. But then the metaphorical,

figurative meaning of the Joshua story becomes clear, and is finally seen to be much more

important than the rather unhistorical tale itself.

""David and Goliath"" is the  final show, and it too has a modern, totally frank look at the career

of King David. After some informative studies of slings (against Goliath) and lyres (played for

King Saul) the conclusions are, again, not for children's bedtime stories or fundamentalists. It

shows David to have been a ruthless monarch, quite prepared to kill, or have killed, anyone who

stood in his way, such as Saul, or his own son Absolom; but then, as the commentary states,

this was the norm in the ancient world, with many ""great"" leaders, such as Constantine and

Cleopatra, being equally ruthless.",1094256000,16,2088,5.070588235294117
1972185,4,B00015HXF4,"I once watched a different documentary that stated when considering the Bible, everthing from David on could be matched with archelogical investigations; implying of course that everything before David was suspect. Suspect or fable or myth or...
I read the single review of this dvd and hit on his complaint that this dvd offers 'only' conjecture. Shall we explore conjecture? The world is flat. The earth is the center of all. Neanderthals were our ancestors.
  I have looked on most of the early bible/old testament as fable... morality tales. I was appreciative of a possiblity that maybe there are truths behind the fables, or historical people and/or events the tales could have been based on. 'Joseph's Canal' made my eyes wide.
  And the presented version of David makes a lot more sense than the Bible's, because it doesn't just tell good bits. God's chosen one, modest child who would eventually rule God's people, who was good and honest, until suddenly he wasn't.
  At this point 'most' of human history is forever more unknown, lost, only assumptions based on the limited surviving artifacts and stories leading us to our best guesses. And it was entertaining and thought provoking... or at least thought proding... on this best guest... or conjecture.",1088985600,4,1264,5.052884615384615
1972186,4,B00015HXF4,"I watched this series every week on the Discovery Channel and enjoyed it very much, although I disagree with some of its findings.  If a thought-provoking (though at times controversial) set of documentaries on the Bible is your cup of tea, then this box is for you.
I would give this set 5 stars, if it weren't for the fact that there was space on these discs for two more programs in the series.  Discs 1 and 3 contain only three episodes, while disc 2 has four.  The program ""Who Was Moses?"" would have fit rather nicely on the first DVD about the Old Testament.  And if the episode on the second disc called ""The Real Disciples"" had been placed on the third disc, titled ""Mysteries of the Apostles"", there would have been room on disc 2 for perhaps the best documentary of the entire series, ""Mary, the Mother of Jesus"".  I think the Discovery Channel and the BBC dropped the ball a bit on this set but, overall, it is still worth the purchase.",1085097600,40,948,4.394285714285714
1972204,1,B00015HXF4,As I write this I have this DVD playing on my computer.  I haven't watched all of it and I won't watch all of it.  It is rubbish.  The idea that mere word frequency is enough to conclude that the Gospel of John and Revelation don't have the same author is asinine.  The two Books were written anywhere from 20 to 50 years apart and they don't have the same purpose (a biography of Christ and a prophecy of future events).  Only a fool would think the vocabulary would have to be the same in order to have the same author.  And only a fool would believe this program.,1385078400,,566,4.146788990825688
1972205,5,B00015HXF4,"Very nicely done. Of all the bibilical evidence or historical shows, this series is my favorite. There is nothing outlandish or off topic. Very well put together production. Attention to the language and customs of the times. There is a realism to these programs. I do not like cheap productions, this is a quality series.",1333152000,3,322,4.872727272727273
1972206,5,B00015HXF4,"So I watched a few episodes of this series a long time ago on tv and was delighted to see there were more.
There are 2 things you need to think about before purchasing this.
First, are you open minded?
If you are interested in history, and archeology and truth, this is a great series. It actually lends credence To many stories of the bible. But it is honest, we know much of history is exaggerated or inaccurate and this series tears down and corrects many stories of the bible. Others, it restates and says, rather bluntly, ""yeah, sorry, we just couldn't find anything to support that outside of what is written in the bible."" It uses science and hundreds of years of study and understanding by dozens of scholars (not biblical scholars mind you, real, evidence finding researching scholars, not people who have never been within 4000 miles of the place but claim they have prayed on it for hours)  to reframe other passages. It really is fascinating and some of the conclusions might surprise you, while others remain far fetched. The series is very polite and allows the audience to make their own judgements.

Second, are you a bible thumping fool?
Why did you read this far into the review? As soon as you saw the word science, you should have yelled that I am a witch and run for cover.",1294531200,2,1294,4.549356223175966

I FELT NAUSEATED JUST LOOKING AT THEM! THE DVD ABOUT HEROD ASKED A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER HE WAS A  MURDER OR NOT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS! ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BIBLE CLEARLY SAYS THAT HE MURDERED MANY! THEN, ON THE DVD ABOUT JUDAS, THET HAD THE BOLD FOOLISH GAUL TO SAY THAT JUDAS NEVER BETRAYED CHRIST BECAUSE HE TOOK THE MEN TO A PLACE WHERE JESUS AND THE OTHERS ALREADY MET BEFORE! CHRIST SAID HIMSELF THAT THE ONE WHO WOULD BETRAY ME IS THE ONE WHO WILL DIP THE SOP WITH ME! SO IF HE WASNT BETRAYED, THEN WHY WOULD JESUS SAY IT OUT OF HIS OWN MOUTH? JESUS ALSO ASKED JUDAS AT THE BETRAYAL SIGHT HIMSELF, BERAYEST THOUGH ME WITH A KISS? SO THIS COLLECTION OF MOVIES WAS A DISASTER AND A COMPLETE FALSIFYING OF THE WORD OF GOD AND ITS TESTIMONIES. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE TO ANYONE WHO DOESNT KNOW CHRIST AND WANTS TO KNOW HIM. IT WOULD DISCOURAGE THEM AWAY FROM HIM AND INTO THE HANDS OF AN OCCULT. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS FOR ANYONE WHO USED TO KNOW CHRIST AND IS COMING BACK. THAT WOULD CONFIRM THEIR FALLING AWAY AND MAKE THEM STAY OUR THERE WITH NO HOPE OF WHO CHRIST WAS IN THEIR LIVES TO BEGIN WITH. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BUY THIS FOR ANY SUSTAINED CHRISTIAN TO CAUSE A SPIRITUAL APOSTACY. I FEEL SORRY FOR THOSE WHO THOUGHT THIS UP, THOSE WHO WILLING BECAME A PART OF ITS PRODUCTION, THOSE WHO ARE SELLING IT BY THE TRUCKLOAD, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO BELEIVE THIS STUMBLING BLOCK LITERATURE!

1972208,5,B00015HXF4,"A great series by the BBC, well presented by Avery Brooks. These documentaries take us back (Old & New Testament stories), present what probably happened or how/why an event occurred & probable scientific explanation of the specific occurance. Issues like these are difficult to navigate & are often controversial, other times there are conflicting views & the documentary has to be committed to one of the views. Example is the view that Simon Peter died in Rome (Roman Catholic view) and the other that he died in Jerusalem (Tabor / Jacobovici). The former is presented here. The series are also insightful & educational with beautiful re-nactments of particular stories. The stories really come alive & real people eventually start to emerge!

1972212,5,B00015HXF4,"I really enjoyed this video. They interview archaeologists who discuss their ideas and theories about three Old Testament stories: David and Goliath, Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors, and Joshua and the Walls of Jericho.

In the Joseph and the Coat of Many Colors video, they discuss some archaeological findings in the Middle East that some people think is the tomb of Joseph. They also discuss how Joseph may have rose to be the Prime Minister of Egypt, from some new findings in that area.

In the Joshua and the Walls of Jericho story, they theorize that it was an earthquake that may have brought down the walls of Jericho, perfectly timed as Joshua's forces were on the outskirts. We have seismic data of Middle Eastern earthquakes over the past 100 years, and they line up almost exactly where certain cities of antiquity were destroyed, too, such as the city of Troy.

This is a really neat video!",1224979200,,907,4.6918238993710695

1972223,5,B00015HXF4,"As a religion professor specializing in the Bible, I cannot recommend this documentary highly enough. I will limit my comments to the episode on Joshua and Jericho, excerpts of which I show in my class each semester. Although this documentary is rather more disconcerting for conservative believers than another that I also show,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mysteries-of-the-Bible-Joshua-at-the-Walls-of-Jericho/dp/B000F4AREU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mysteries of the Bible: Joshua at the Walls of Jericho</a>, it is in many ways more useful. It includes not only the classic evidence from Kenyon's archaeological work at Jericho, but also considerations from fields as diverse as acoustics and genetics. It includes the most recent scholarship, including the studies of the highland settlements by Israel Finkelstein, the work on the continuity of pottery styles by William Dever and others, as well as extremely recent (and thus still ongoing) research on the relations between Israelites and Canaanites from a genetic standpoint.

The most recent evidence confirms what historians had suspected for some time, namely that the majority of the Israelites did not come from elsewhere, but from the land of Canaan itself.

The message of the documentary, however, is not only fair but extremely powerful, in showing that the story, while not historical, continues to be meaningful, in terms of its abiding message about freedom. Avery Brooks does a wonderful job of both guiding the viewer through the issues and evidence, and in expressing the emotional power of the story.

The presentation may seem to some to be one-sided, but while there is significant disagreement on various details among historians and Biblical archaeologists, there is nearly universal agreement on two points, which are accurately conveyed by the documentary. First, when there are both kinds of evidence, archaeological evidence takes priority, since it gives us direct access to the time in question, whereas any texts that may have been written will have been written later (in some cases much later). Second, there is simply no way to take the archaeological evidence seriously and to believe that the Biblical account in Joshua is a straightforward factual account. It may contain historical details that are accurate, and may reflect actual battles fought over a longer period of time, but that is to say that it may have some genuine historical information in it, which many historians agree. But there is a big gap between this historical approach and its conclusions, and the conservative viewpoint that the story provides factual details and does so inerrantly. To believe the latter, one has to ignore the evidence from so many other fields of inquiry that it is all but impossible for any honest thinking individual to do so.

I discuss these matters further on my blog at [...]",1175558400,2,2915,5.514541387024608
1972224,1,B00015HXF4,"While the analysis of Joseph's story is quite good and commendable, BBC did a poor job in gathering information about the reality of Joshua's conquests. It's biased and arrives at a farfetched conclusion that the story of Jericho is a myth. The archaeologists chosen are not authoritative and seem biased against the Bible record which weakens the conclusion. At the end they seem to infer that we have to accept the story of Joshua as mere hope and faith that the promised land was all people's desires towards liberation and freedom. Why can't we accept the Bible by faith rather than try to explain everything scientifically. Archaeology cannot provide all the answers, especially when the archaelogists are biased.",1167955200,4,718,5.093220338983051

It's ""OK, here's what the Bible says, here's what we know, here's what we can prove. Now go make up your mind.""  They don't set out to debunk the 'religiousity' of any of it, just to present the facts based on what we know.  Plus, the visuals of the area are unbelievable.

1972228,4,B00015HXF4,"The first part of this collection is about King Herod, and his infamous 'slaughter of the innocents' at Bethlehem. It's very well done, and Herod is accurately portrayed as a brutal despot. The only evidence against the 'slaughter' ever happening is that it's only mentioned in St. Matthew's Gospel, and no other ancient source, Biblical or otherwise. But then it's at last revealed that the actual number of children involved was at most 20, which would have been insignificant for a savage king like Herod, so that all the modern analysis comes together as being fully consistent with the Gospel account.

The 2'nd part. the 'Real Disciples of Jesus', is not so great, being much better done in Melvyn Bragg's earlier TV mini-series ""The Apostles""; it tries to use modern forensic science where it can't really fit. Also, it assumes Jesus' miracles to be 'faith-healing', which doesn't really explain his feeding the multitude with a few loaves and fishes, or turning water into wine, or calming the storm, etc.

The 3'rd part, 'Who killed Jesus?' seems incongruous at first, but actually manages to blend the ancient accounts with modern forensics in a way that makes for good viewing.

The final part, about Mary Magdalene, is not bad, but again it was better done in Melvyn Bragg's series. It's good to see Mary's name cleared from the medieval notion that she was a woman of ill repute, but this probably goes too far the other way, giving undue emphasis to the so-called 'Gospel of Mary Magdalene'. That 'gospel' was probably written a century after Mary, by a woman trying to further her own career, not Jesus' message.",1104624000,23,1627,4.88768115942029
1972229,1,B00015HXF4,"I recently purchased this series and was I ever surprised when I watched it at home. Not pleasantly!!! They try to explain everything in a scientific way. It's very clear that Bible believing Christians did not have a hand in creating these programs. For instance, they want you to think that Paul who was one of the New Testament's greatest apostles (The Apostle to the Gentiles) was mentally ill. They compare him to an epileptic who he sees things and NEVER actually speaks to GOD. For instance Paul never actually saw the resurrected Christ when he was on the way to Damascus. He just thought he saw him. He was struck by lightning. That's why he was blind for 3 days. If you believe in God please save your money and don't buy this series. All of my friends are Christians.

The second, on St. Paul, is good, but probably tries too hard with science and archaeology where it doesn't really fit in with the Biblical traditions.

The final part, on the ""Revelations"" / Apocalypse is great, and long overdue.

8006797,4,B00015HXF4,"Religions with by far with the greatest following are those having integral reward systems i.e. those that promise eternal bliss and other incentives for adhering to an assumed supreme doctrine. Though there are those of religious orientation with admirable motives, many delude themselves of having genuine love/devotion, the real fascination and motivation deriving primarily from celebrity like status and power of religious figures and promise of an eternally blissful after-life. Take away the embellishments: Business-as-usual insurance policy.

 Secure in being raptured and eternity bound beliefs based on faith rather than proven fact manifest into serious threats from a third of the world not sharing fully responsibility for critical issues such as over-population, environmental degradation and general long-term planetary sustainability.

 Personally I find the conventional Christian concept of salvation and crucification baffling. Was Christians sacrifice originally divine or necessary and could such a love for humanity been demonstrated inspiringly yet in a less harsh, debt laden manner?

Unlike Christ with decisive foreknowledge of knowing where he came from and going I'm didn't submit being born into a world of contradiction, confusion, injustice and chaos. I just want the opportunity to be accepted as an imperfect work in progress and live modestly in peace and harmony  - Which should be an inherent birth-right for all things ...so is there a logical reason to be beholding or saved?

 If there be a divine entity he would not have the petty traits, egotism, subjugations, and inflexible technical judgments projected onto him by people, but qualities of compassionate commonality.

Regardless of orientation it would seem cultivating an open heart, mind, progressive nature and aspirational focus on whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony to all things without further expectation of reward the more essential integral qualifying, comprehensive, and purifying essence of spirituality and human potential.

Devastating Perfection: Many find reason to question the existence of an all-powerful God with so much suffering having occurred to the innocent throughout the ages. Was Jesus wondrously delusional in a beautiful way? Did his disciples pass on biases or exaggerate to have a personal sense of power, security and everlasting future or many thereafter delete, distort embellish to feel special, superior, exploit otherwise? Bearing in mind faith is just that; faith not fact, leaves one with the premise that if there is some kind of divine order then life's primary purpose is to learn and evolve to interact harmoniously. Though there can be no doubt for those of progressive inclination living is a great character building, many experiences seem pointless and even cruel ...still there is hope: For just as it is unreasonable to assume the existence of the divine, it's also to conclude its non-existence, for as myself, many people around the world regardless of religion or otherwise have had similar miraculous experiences with a common thread with no other possible explanation other than being of divine origin (i.e. see oberf.org). Having exhausted logical explanations, could inexplicable chaos and confusion serve a greater purpose of purification of motive and goodness for its own sake ...in other words regardless of what the future may hold aspiring to whatever manifests the greatest harmony for all things and therefore our greater and truer salvation as a planet, race and individual?

Having studied the commonality of ideals of capitalistic democracy, communism and religion worldwide its disconcerting to find throughout the ages the majority of resources serving extravagance, hierarchy and consolidation of power often achieved and maintained through the exploitation, depredation and ignorance of the common man  - Not to mention the persecutions and ravages caused by related warfare.

Such social entities go great lengths to create the perception of order from chaos, then fill in the discontinuities with canned patriotism, the requirement of faith to obtain eternal life, or worse avoid eternal hell.

It seems many people need structure, ritual, definition  ...an iconic supernatural entity to embellish, plead their cares to, worship And integral reward system to derived security from being destined for eternal life.

Although within all creeds and religions there are exceptional individuals with characteristics and values worthy of emulation, its common to project lesser human qualities unto the character of the divine and worship, cater too and regulate others accordingly while depending on divine intervention instead of taking personal responsibility to create a sustainable world and purifying ones motives while realistically aspire to whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony for all things.

Must we subscribe to exclusive assumptions without reservation and continually seed the beds of worldwide ecological disaster, convolution, divisiveness and strife?

... And why not goodness for its own sake? What could be simpler, more purifying, self-affirming, divine in character ...and to the point!

Antidote for what may be a hapless godless world:

If we find transcendent beauty and compassion in ourselves and others then surely in the vastness of the universe are evolved worlds, dimensions and beings of empathy that have manifested such benevolent harmonious qualities sustainably.

Such certainty assures great possibilities here and beyond for beings throughout the cosmos of progressive inclination.",1426377600,,5615,5.676610978520286
