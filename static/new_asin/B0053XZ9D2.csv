4553002,5,B0053XZ9D2,"A great video of the 100th anniversary of the passing of the world's greatest guitarist, Django Reinhardt. 100 guitarists gather to pay honor to Django including his grandson David as well as other stellar guitarists in this genre that include Tchavolo Schmitt, Romane, Angelo Debarre and Boulou Ferrer. It is a French movie with subtitles but don't let that put you off. The music was invented in France. You will hear some history as well as some great performances surrounded by the picturesque ambience of Samois sur Seine. Musique directement  partir du caeur. Vive Django Reinhardt.",1349568000,3,588,5.125
4553003,5,B0053XZ9D2,"Anyone who might have been put off by ""Beth""s review missed out, big time.  This isn't a primer of Django Reinhart's music that you can put on while you are trying to impress your friends at a dinner party.  If you want that, buy a ""greatest-hits"" CD.

This is a beautifully crafted and touching tribute to this artist by the musicians who were so captivated by his playing that they immediately began to play in his style.  Just the sight of the Django 100, in studio, was enough to put a lump in my throat.  The brotherhood of these musicians is so strong and touching.

I recommend this to Django fans, to guitarists, percussionists, Francophiles, and just to lovers of the passion that music can inspire in people.",1339372800,8,718,4.5703125
4553004,2,B0053XZ9D2,"Unless you can understand French, or are buying this for the performance of Minor Swing only, don't bother.  It's mostly talk (in French) and the subtitles are not readable most of the time.  I was hoping for more music.  If you do buy it, don't get thrown by the previews at the beginning.  The menu doesn't appear until later.  We thought we had mistakenly received the wrong DVD.",1321747200,7,382,4.5588235294117645
8455913,2,B0053XZ9D2,"I am a classically trained musician (Yale School of Music) so, while I don't play the guitar, I can certainly understand any musical description. There is none in this film, at least not in the first half which I watched. I stopped, because I got tired of watching a bunch of old guys reminisce about how they got started playing like Django when they were teenagers or younger. I was waiting to hear what playing like Django meant, but such information was not forthcoming. Did their Hero invent a new style of strumming? Was his fingering unique? Did he tune the instrument differently from the way that, say Segovia tuned his? 26 minutes into the film I have no idea. I also have no idea how some guy in his 40s or 50s simply picks up sticks and moves to a little village along the Seine because thats where Django lived, with no mention of how this pilgrim is going to make a living there. Disappointing, because I expected much more, and really boring.",1517616000,,957,4.505747126436781

8455919,2,B0053XZ9D2,Not a worthwhile watch. I was hoping to learn about the life of Django but as other reviewers have pointed out it is just a whole bunch of fans going on about how much they love Django and then playing his music. A very tedious watch.,1412467200,,234,4.108695652173913
8455920,5,B0053XZ9D2,"Great documentary! If you are a fan of Django Reinhardt, or Gypsy Jazz in general this is the film for you. just try not to get to depressed about your own talent after watching it; there are a lot of very talents guitarists on this video.",1411257600,,239,4.217391304347826
8455921,5,B0053XZ9D2,"This is an excellent video for both jazz fans and novices. Followers, family and musicologists discuss the great legacy of Django Reinhardt as they begin to gather for the 100 Django commemorative event. There is only one drawback to this film: there appears to be no soundtrack available! Curses!
Anyway, enjoy this incredibly sweet and joyous celebration of Django's music.",1380585600,3,375,5.266666666666667
8455922,2,B0053XZ9D2,"There are only a few minutes of enjoyment in this video, which I watched via Netflix.  The idea of assembling a large group of players to ""pay homage"" to Django is a good one.  I love Django, and that's the reason this documentary annoyed me.

What I was hoping for (and perhaps expecting) was a documentary that was about Django.  It is not.  It is a documentary about his drooling French fanboys.  Here is the documentary in a nutshell.  They interview a bunch of guitar players (only guitar players mind you-no simple music lovers) about the impact Django still has on their lives, years after he's been gone.  Each one of them rambles about him, basically calling him ""God.""  They show footage of some of them playing his songs, and then the huge gathering in a studio.  Most of them are great players, though one of them is so incredibly annoying (a hard plucker of the strings...incessantly hard plucking)I wanted to book a flight so I could smash his guitar over his head.

I love Django.  I want to learn about him.  I don't give a sweet turd about what someone, whose pride in his music stems mostly from their common geography, has to say about him.

Oh, and near the end...one or two of them happen to mention Stephane Grapelli's invlovement.  Django was a tremendous player-his injury was never apparent in his playing.  It deserves mentioning simply because he played so brilliantly despite it.  But, Grapelli as an afterthought is such a shame.

This is not a documentary for Django lovers.  If you already know who he is-don't bother.  This is a documentary for people who've never heard of him, or for people who enjoy watching others worship him.",1367280000,2,1663,4.6689655172413795
