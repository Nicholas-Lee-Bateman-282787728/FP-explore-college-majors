6708080,5,B00O2QWGJ6,Really a surprising workout! The last time I was this sore from a workout I had hired a personal trainer. I love the short and to the point workout,1419724800,7,147,4.103448275862069
6708081,5,B00O2QWGJ6,"I have worked out for over 20 plus years.  I have tried many different styles and even several different wrestling sponsored DVDs (Chyna Fitness, Stratusphere Yoga, DDP Yoga, etc.) and this is by far one of the most excellent workout videos I have ever come across.  Stephanie is concise and the workout is definitely challenging.  I would highly recommend this if you are looking to become more tone or just need a change of pace from your usual workout routines.  Very well done!!!!",1419120000,5,484,4.795180722891566
6708082,5,B00O2QWGJ6,I really enjoyed this video and im glad i bought it. Ive bought other workout videos in the past but this is my favorite. Easy to follow along.,1418860800,3,143,4.142857142857143
6708083,5,B00O2QWGJ6,I did this workout last night and I really enjoyed it. I feel like next time I can go heavier on the weights. If anyone needs modified exercises they are demonstrated for you.,1418688000,8,175,4.333333333333333
6708084,5,B00O2QWGJ6,"This workout DVD focuses mostly for the ladies (though anyone can do it) Stephanie McMahon comes off as a great trainer and very professional. The 5 workouts seem more low-impact so they are easy for anyone to do. The DVD says it requires dumbbells but they are not used very much so anyone can do this without dumbbells (only 1 workout really uses they and are not required for it). The workouts focus more on burning and staying fit (as title suggests). And each workout comes with a quick warm-up and cool-down. Plus, the DVD comes with a 4 week schedule/calendar.

This is another great workout dvd, very easy and low-impact for those who want to be fit. I hope WWE makes more of these.",1417478400,10,690,4.52

6708092,5,B00O2QWGJ6,"Perfect solution if your short on time. Each workout isn't very long but, they are very effective. I love the 4 week chart that came with it because for someone that is out of shape it builds your endurance up. Some of the moves I've never done before. My favorite move is planking then twisting your hips while planking. It is harder than you realize. Next time you think you don't have time, check this one out!",1460419200,,413,4.376623376623376

6708095,4,B00O2QWGJ6,"What initially peaked my interest was seeing them use 10lb and 15lb weights! That is something to shoot for:-) Each section is about 15 mins there are 5 sections; upper body, lower body, abs, cardio, flexibility-about 7 mins. You will need a set of light and heavy weights. I'm using 6lb & 8lb right now. I hope to progress as time goes.  It comes with a 4 week plan to follow.
I just did the upper body and there were some exercises that I didn't like, some were just difficult for me. In the warm up part, she does a stretch where you lay on your face, bend one arm and stretch the other. It seemed like a gimmick move to me. I just did my own stretches. Push-ups are hard for me, but there is a modifier. The 1st round they do 8 reps, then 12 reps. Exercise are; push ups, one arm rows, bicep curls, tricep kickbacks.
If an exercise seems too easy to complete, up the weights. It is easy to follow with normal exercises. I will try to update as possible.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Fit-Series-Stephanie-Mcmahon/dp/B00O2QWGJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE Fit Series: Stephanie Mcmahon</a>",1456185600,,1138,4.927083333333333

6708099,4,B00O2QWGJ6,"The workouts are challenging, but very easy to learn. Stephanie isn't annoying as an instructor, so I don't get burned out watching the same routines over and over. The workouts didn't look or feel too challenging at first, but I was sore for weeks! My only complaint is that if you select the ""music only"" option, you still have to watch all the ""how-to"" steps with Stephanie, but the video mutes her speaking. I wish that you could just skip that entire segment and go straight to the workout (you can with your remote via fast-forward, but it'd be a lot easier if it had that option to begin with). I also like that you can do a customized workout selection, doing each of the four workouts in any order, but you're limited to three.",1445904000,,736,4.45925925925926
6708100,5,B00O2QWGJ6,"I have been working out for almost 30 years.  I have done many DVD programs at home.  Unfortunately, I have had back issues and other physical problems with many of them.  My son is a certified strength and conditioning coach and obtained his degree in exercise science.  This is the only DVD he recommends for me (other than the stationary bike).  There are many ""famous"" exercise/weight loss gurus that have you do things that can compromise your health.  You would be surprised and I had to learn the hard way.  No matter what program you do, you must be very careful with the exact details of the correct pose.  I have been doing this DVD for awhile and I still listen to the instructions because I believe we all get complacent in our form.  Based on my experience and my son's expertise, I highly recommend this DVD.",1443398400,4,822,4.537414965986395

This was the star of all the gifts. She has been using it for months now and absolutely loves it. She said that Stephanie is a great instructor and gives her a great work out and really gets her blood pumping. Stephanie keeps in mind all the different needs and problems women face when doing exercises.

Would highly recommend this to anyone from the results I have seen from my friend. Best price around!",1440806400,,555,4.235849056603773

6708120,2,B00O2QWGJ6,"I was not impressed with this workout.  Definitely more for beginners.  Low intensity. The resistance training work outs are old school working on single muscle groups at a time.  The cardio is probably the best part of the DVD.  If you want a full body workout doing cardio and resistance training, then buy a HIIT workout DVD and don't waste your time and money on this one.",1429056000,4,376,4.567164179104478
6708121,2,B00O2QWGJ6,"I received this as soon as it came out,as it seemed as though it would be a solid workout and I was highly disappointed. Not only were many of the moves too easy for me,there were no new or unique moves on here. It was the same old standard moves that I've seen and done thousands of times. I am 48 and an intermediate to advanced excerciser and have quite an extensive collection of workout dvd's. I decide if a workout is a keeper based on whether or not it's different then what I already have,whether I feel challenged and whether I feel a craving to do it again. This workout had none of that-I did it once and after trying 3 times to sell it on EBay,it's been collecting dust. I just have too many amazing workouts to wasted time with anything mediocre.",1428710400,3,759,4.277777777777778

6708125,5,B00O2QWGJ6,I absolutely LOVED Stephanie Mcmahon's workout DVD. She went through the routines before she started the workout and it helped as she went through the steps. I so hope she comes out with more workout videos! I think she does well at it!,1426636800,2,236,4.511627906976744
6708126,5,B00O2QWGJ6,Very challenging! I thought the workouts wouldn't be as intense as they are because they aren't very long. I was wrong. The first two weeks I couldn't even make it all the way through the cardio and abs/core. I still get sore after every workout. The workout calendar is very helpful!,1426636800,2,284,4.588235294117647
6708127,1,B00O2QWGJ6,"I use lots of workout DVDs and was not impressed with this. I think it is more for beginners. Also, you cannot fast forward through the opening intro which wastes my time. They also waste time throughout the workouts demonstrating each movement. The times are not great either. Each section (upper, lower, etc) are short (15 mins) but if you combine them it's longer than I want. I like a good (hard) 20-30 min workout... Just my preference. Wanted to like it because my boys are WWE fans but just can't.",1426204800,4,504,4.549450549450549
6708128,5,B00O2QWGJ6,"I love this video. Have been a huge fan of wrestling since I was 5. You look at Stephanie in a different way verses Watching her on tv playing the bad guy. :) once I got use to the exercise, I went up on my weights. The cardio still kicks my butt til this day. I like that you can go at your own pace and have time during the next segment of workouts. I actually plan on ordering Triple H ' s DVD just for me. And keep my weights the same, as he uses heavier ones for the men. He does different workouts that I wanna try for myself. You may think wrestling is fake, but their trainings for WWE is real and hard work.",1425686400,3,616,3.858267716535433

And the ONE thing they all have in common it that they are way to extreme for a beginner or someone only moderately in shape. They all focus on Speed and how fast you can get ""ripped"" and I always wind up hurting myself trying to keep up. I work long hours and don't really have time to go to the gym or do hour long work outs, so the short exercises in this series are perfect. They focus on controlled movements quality not quantity. I am definitely sore when I am done but not in PAIN, muscles feel worked and tired that's all. I don't feel discouraged if I cant keep up or can't do a move perfectly. Just hit pause and try again. If it is definitely something I know I can't do yet even if I can't do the modified version.  I do as many as I can do comfortably even if its just 1 or 2(who knows your body better than you do? So listen to it!) and then focus on the moves I can do. I will get better at them over time. I never feel discouraged or defeated so there is no reason to give up.( I've done that many times.)

It is really inexpensive and a great program for someone getting started or just wants a short workout. The great thing about this program designed by Joe DeFranco is that you can make it as hard or as easy as you want by adding in more reps in the timed circuits or upping the weight or doing another workout. The one flaw is that this program doesn't really have a warmup chapter like the HHH one or the others in the BeFit series, so I just do my own thing to warm up or use one of the ones from the other series; I am a fan of the entire line of the Lionsgate BeFit.
