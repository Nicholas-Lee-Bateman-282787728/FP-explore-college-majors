8730972,4,B014JDV3RM,"I watched the on Amazon Prime Acorn subscription.  Very amusing, but also a serious element to the series.  This is ""coming of age in the early 1970s"" story.

Recommend.  I hope there will be a season 2, but even if there isn't, it ended in a fulfilling way.",1469836800,3,454,4.54320987654321
