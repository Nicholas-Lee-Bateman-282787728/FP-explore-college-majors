1831852,4,B000089QAN,"I purchased this DVD because I enjoy power yoga (and traditional yoga)  but do not always have the time to complete a 45 minute to an hour flow.  The 10 minute segments allow me to incorporate a bit of yoga into my cardiovascular exercise regime.

I enjoy doing the first segment as a warm up to my morning workout.  The quick sun salute series is an energizing way to greet the day and transitions nicely into an aerobic workout.

The stability section (3rd segment) is a nice wrap up to my workout.  I do it in place of my customary crunches and it provides a bit of a body stretch, making it a pleasant cool down.

Unfortunately, I rarely use the 2nd segment on this tape which focuses on the warrior poses as these tend to hurt my weak knees.  It should also be noted that on my DVD, under the ""Choose Workout"" option in the main menu, the 2nd and 3rd segments are listed incorrectly.

This workout does not take the place of longer and more focused yoga practice. However, it allows me to incorporate yoga into a dynamic, full body workout.  I recommend it to those with yoga experience who want to add variety to their practice.",1116374400,,1134,4.382775119617225
1831853,1,B000089QAN,"Based on my experience, I would strongly recommend that you not purchase this DVD.  When I recently received this DVD, it appeared that I had received the correct one based on the case and the label on the DVD itself.  However, when I played the DVD, it was evident that it was not a yoga DVD.  I contacted the company and they stated that they were aware of the production problem.  They stated that I needed to send back the DVD with a note explaining the problem, my name, address, and phone number.  They didn't even volunteer to pay for shipping to return the DVD for THEIR error. I purchased this DVD because my time is often limited.  I resent having to waste it for their error.  After several email exchanges, I've just told them they can keep their DVD.  On the final email, they finally suggested that I contact Amazaon directly. I have never had a problem where I had to return a product from Amazon.  I'm so fed up right now, I'm going to just forget it!",1110672000,,967,4.35754189944134
1831854,3,B000089QAN,"This fast-moving workout makes it hard to attain the ""correct"" yoga positions I've previously learned.  I also found it dangerous for the knees, esp. as you quickly twist and flow through the warrior poses.  The instructor's demeanor can be best described as ""mock joy.""  I would not buy again, though many power yoga fans like it a lot.  The Quick Fix format is nice with the 10-minute countdown timer.",1109116800,,403,4.797101449275362
1831855,4,B000089QAN,"This is a great power yoga workout if you only have a few minutes to spare.  You'll find that you do a lot of sweating in just ten minutes, and since there are three workouts, each targeted to a different area, if you have more time, you can do all of them for a total body workout.  Highly recommended.",1104796800,,303,4.11864406779661
1831856,4,B000089QAN,Very good yoga sequence..it does flow together nicely.  You'll get warm and not sweaty.  Good to do if you want to gain flexibility and increase strength/balance.,1083888000,,162,5.1923076923076925
7980774,5,B000089QAN,I have been wanting this video on DVD for a long time and was able to purchase it for a $1 plus shipping.  It was so easy and I received the package earlier than expected.  I would definitely recommend this seller!,1361836800,,214,4.195121951219512
7980775,1,B000089QAN,I really don't know what to say - I just wasn't a fan of the workout.  Other people may love it - actually this workout I bought on a recommendation of a friend she loves it!,1353283200,,174,3.8333333333333335
7980776,5,B000089QAN,This is a great yoga DVD. I used it every other day for over a year and never tired of it as is only half an hour with great flow. Gives a full body workout. Good for days when you don't have an hour to spare. The time passes quickly and there are 2 people showing more difficult and easier modifications as well as the instructor.,1302393600,,331,4.03030303030303
7980777,3,B000089QAN,"I gave this three stars to cuation any beginners from getting this DVD.  If you do not know your base Yoga moves and the flows between moves you could do more damage than good (IMHO).

For those who are Intermediate to advanced you will enjoy this practice very much. It is fast paced and very energizing.",1242345600,,305,4.428571428571429
7980778,5,B000089QAN,"The first time I put in this video I was a little concerned that I wouldn't be able to learn the poses, but after the second time I was surprised how much better I was.

I almost have all the quick fix DVDs and each one is fantastic. With 2 young kids and a business out of my home, I don't have a lot of time to spare and the quick fix videos give a good energizing workout in a small amount of time.

This is not a relaxing yoga dvd. It's vigorous enough that you build a good sweat (I always have to turn down the heat and open a window), but if you are a bit flexibility challenged (like me) then you can follow the modified version and Joy gives good hints throughout. Easy to follow her through the DVD and once you get the hang of the poses, you can just listen for joys audio cues and not look at the screen.

I always feel very energized after this workout and highly recommend the quick fix series for those people that want a good quality workout in 3 10 minute segments. Sometimes I do one 10 minute segment, tend to the kids and then go back for the other two.",1228435200,,1073,4.028169014084507
7980779,5,B000089QAN,"The vinyasas are basic, but easy to memorize and modify in length and intensity, then take anywhere to do on the go.  I've been doing the standing routine for about 3 years now, and have mixed it up by adding new poses and mixing it with other vinyasas.  Each workout is only 10 minutes, but again, once you've memorized them, you can stretch it out as long as you want.

This is a great power yoga for beginners. The first routine on the DVD will give you some great basic pointers.  It *is* quick, so if you're really new to yoga, you will want to supplement it by reading about each pose (or taking a class), so you can put yourself the poses correctly.",1212364800,,656,4.266129032258065
7980780,4,B000089QAN,"I consider myself a moderately advanced cardio exerciser, and I do practice yoga (particularly power yoga) regularly, and I was really working to keep up with this work out!  Joy moves very quickly, and although she gives some reminders on form and position, one must have familiarity with yoga poses in order to attempt to keep up.  This is definitely fast-flowing yoga - no pose is held for more than a couple of seconds, and you will be working to keep your breath even.  If you are looking for a relaxing, mostly stretching yoga practice, this one isn't for you! If you want to get moving and wake yourself up, then you'll love it!  If you do all three sections, you will definitely get a moderate cardio workout.  Although I wasn't crazy about this workout (I much prefer Bryan Kest, particularly his Power series), I will keep it.  It will be terrific when I am short on time but want to get the breath flowing and the blood pumping!",1141084800,,939,4.5266272189349115
7980781,5,B000089QAN,"I have been practicing yoga steadily for slightly over a year. Monday through Friday I have no more than 40 minutes typically available to exericse. Until I began to use this dvd I was not able to find a power yoga dvd that allowed me to go through a challenging series of sun sals, standing/twisting poses, and core work in the limited time I had available. QF power yoga is therefore a most welcome addition to my collection because it does offer in 30 minutes exactly what I needed. The instructor, Joy Kilpatrick, provides precise directions needed to flow through the range of poses in this short practice. As always, it is helpful to watch the dvd at least once before using it. When the the three cleansing breaths that finish the dvd are completed, I feel entirely relaxed in the way that is realized by vigorous flow work. Though not mentioned in the dvd, I naturally go into a five or so minute final resting pose after the dvd is completed, and, in 35-40 minutes, have done my practice for the day. My wife reports that the ten minute segments are also useful as adjuncts to other forms of exercise. For example, she uses the core segment to finish strenth training.",1131148800,,1177,4.556603773584905
7980782,3,B000089QAN,this is a tough yoga workout - not like I normally do - much more aerobic than relaxing,1120521600,,87,3.888888888888889
7980783,5,B000089QAN,"I adore yoga.  It leaves me feeling athletic, creative, and invincible.  It's a wonderfully interesting work-out.  But I don't always like the videos.  Some ""get old"" really quickly.  Classes are still better.  But, I love these. They're quick.  No annoying lenghthly intros.  You won't try any unusual positions, but you'll move through familiar ones with excellent instruction.  I totally broke a sweat, and my muscles totally feel awesome the day after.  If you wanna give power yoga a try, or need a quickie for days you have no time, get this!",1119744000,,548,4.923076923076923
