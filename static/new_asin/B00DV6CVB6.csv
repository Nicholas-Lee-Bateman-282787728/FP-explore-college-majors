Great job!",1486252800,,155,5.2
8598177,3,B00DV6CVB6,"She is really lovely - both her personality and her dance style. She is also articulate and well spoken but she talks way too much for me.  She breaks everything down really well - including weight distribution and why she likes a move and when she uses it and how to tweak it and mistakes to avoid etc.
I felt like there was more talking than dancing when she introduced the moves. Maybe that's exactly what some dancers would like but for me it was too slow and I wish she had been more succinct in her verbal instruction.
For the most part I think her combinations are cute (though I will skip her explanation and practice them mostly by watching her.) She has some good steps and she puts them together elegantly. Some steps were new to me.
Many steps are suitable for beginners, some are better for the intermediate dancer.",1484092800,,828,4.447368421052632

8598180,5,B00DV6CVB6,"What a wonderful DVD to add to my collection. I am always looking for new inspiration. This DVD did not disappoint . Amanda' s DVD Embellish your dance was innovative , fun ,  challenging  is a good way and easy to fallow. I highly recommend this video for all levels of dancers. Her leg work is phenomenal!  Bravo Amanda Rose",1411689600,3,326,4.4
8598181,5,B00DV6CVB6,"Amanda Rose is a rising star of Egyptian Style Belly Dance.  I was expecting to see a good performance section - what I had not expected was that her instruction would be so fresh, original yet authentic.  Her style is so lovely and pleasing and in this instructional video she has explained and demonstrated moves very clearly.  The video itself is nicely produced and put together.  It has a solid warm up and basic instruction for ""Leg Work"", ""Spins"" & ""Body Extensions"" and then a great section of combos - showing how to put it together.  This video is for someone with some belly dance basics and who is looking to add ""Embellishments"" to their dance.  Amanda has a playful sense of musicality and natural affinity for how to assemble moves in an interesting and organic insightful way.

The video offers great options to add flourish for an intermediate dancer looking to elevate their performance level within an authentic Egyptian style.  It is a good value with more than 2 hours of content.  I will be watching for more videos from this outstanding instructor and performer.  Great overall instructional video.",1396656000,7,1121,4.852631578947369
