These are great. So informative, and keeps the kids attention with her energy. I even find that my 20 months has her eyes glued to the screen. They both are signing. SO cool.

2963532,5,B000W9DHJ0,I have two autistic twin boys who are four years old and they have not began to speak yet. Both boys were very taken by the videos and loved them instantly. My oldest twin is now starting to speak and says words and phrases that he hears on the videos. My other twin is starting to pick up some of the signs slowly but i know he will get there eventually. These videos are awesome and I recommend these to not only people with children who are hearing impaired but for any young child whether they have a learning disability or not. I even learned a lot of signs within the first few minutes of these DVDs.,1324425600,5,606,4.188034188034188
2963533,5,B000W9DHJ0,"We have at least 10 of the Signing Time DVDs, and we recently moved into Series 2.  We have a 2 1/2 year old, and these signing DVDs are her favorites.  We've found the ""nice to meet you"" volume particularly fun and practical.  Our daughter likes to show the signs to everyone she meets.  I cannot recommend the Signing Time DVDs as a whole strongly enough!  Our daughter is great at expressing herself and communicating with people.  I think we have less problems with the ""terrible twos"" because she's able to use her sign language when she doesn't have the words.",1309996800,,566,4.554455445544554
2963534,5,B000W9DHJ0,"This series is informative, educational and fun.  My 2 year old loves it and it is the old TV he's allowed to watch.  The songs are catchy and along with teaching sign language, Rachel squeezes in some basic math and spelling.  Mom and Dad love the show too and are so inspired by Rachel and her family.

We're big fans of every show we've seen in the series and this DVD is no exception.

 My only complaint is that the price is higher than what I think a 30 min show should be.  We'd love to collect the whole library but instead we're picking up a video here and there because of the cost.  There are a lot of extras which makes me feel a little better about it.",1257984000,,665,4.10077519379845
2963535,5,B000W9DHJ0,"We were first introdiced to Signing Time! DVDs by our pediatric speech and hearing therapist - an added selling point to me was that the therapist doesn't sell them - she just recommends them to those needing to learn sign language with young children, so that they can communicate.

We started with the first three DVDs and board books in series 1 and got hooked right away!  My son learned to communicate very basic wants and needs during that first week, and what a difference in his confidence and communication skilss!!!

Over the months, we have added more Signing Time! DVDs - I'm loving the season 2 series - vol. 1 of season 2 starts introducing *conversational* signing more than just single word signs - things like ""what is your name?"", ""my name is..."", ""nice to meet you"", ""how are you?"", ""see you later"", among others - there are some single words as well, of course, but taught in a way that not only builds the child's vocabulary, but their communication skills at the same time!

I can't recommend Signing Time! highly enough - this has made all the difference for my son, as we work to improve his speech - the signs he knows, he can sign while trying to say the word - his success is greater because we can understand his sign, even if we can't understand his word - so we know what he is trying to SAY, and we can help correct his pronunciation until he learns to say it correctly.  This has helped with language delays and the learning process SO much!

It has also been great fun for my older children who do not have difficulty with speech and hearing issues - they love learning to sign, and make a game of trying to sign as they speak.  We're all still learning - and have much to learn still - but this makes it easy and FUN!",1207353600,,1751,4.385802469135802
2963536,5,B000W9DHJ0,"We have all of the DVDs in Signing Time ""Series 1,"" and I was curious as to why this release was listed under ""Series 2"" instead of just being ""Volume 14.""  Then I saw that there were actual phrases/sentences in this DVD, including the title, ""Nice to meet you,"" as well as, ""What's your name?""/ ""My name is,"" and, ""How are you?"" / ""I'm fine."" (FYI in the special features, the worst off you can be is okay - I guess no one is doing badly in the Signing Time world LOL.)  So I thought to myself, ""Oh, that's why this is 'Series 2' -- it's the next step.  We'll learn phrases and sentences instead of just single words from here on out.  Makes sense!""  However, I've now seen a couple of the other DVDs (Happy Birthday to You and My Favorite Sports) from 'Series 2,"" and thus far, this volume, ""Nice to Meet You"" is the only one with phrases/sentences.  The others are just a bunch of single words again, which I found disappointing.

I guess the reasons that this is now ""Series 2"" are because of 1) the production value and 2) the use of one song for all new words.  As for point 1) Alex and Leah aren't acting in front of a green screen and interacting exclusively with cartoons.  Now there's a real set with real, physical objects that they use in their little ""skits.""  Rachel's background is also different, although she's still basically in front of a green screen.  This aspect of ""Series 2"" is a nice improvement.

As for point 2, in ""series 1"" DVDs there were usually 3 songs that split up the three different topics/acts typically included in each DVD, and the 3 songs incorporated the words from each topic/act.  In ""series 2"" there is one song.  The DVD is still broken up into 3 acts, but instead of a new song with each batch of words, the words are put into a new ""verse"" of the same song.  At the end of the DVD, Rachel sings the entire song with all of the verses.  For me, I don't like this as much.  The song becomes extremely repetitive.  While I really enjoyed a lot of the songs from ""series 1"" (and therefore bought the CDs), I have yet to want to hear any of the ""series 2"" songs outside of watching the DVD.

All of that being said, I love Signing Time.  There is simply no other series out there like it.  As of the writing of this review, there are now 20 volumes between series 1 and 2 (plus 2 other practice DVDs) which provides and immense amount of signs.  My two kids have learned so much from this series that there isn't enough room for me to write about it here.  Even though Series 2 isn't all that I had hoped it would be, Signing Time is still - hands down - the best signing series out there.",1197504000,23,2631,4.238955823293173

8221864,5,B000W9DHJ0,"My lengthy review of Signing Time series 1 volume 11 explained how these DVDS changed my son's and my life. I feel like I should have said more about the DVDS itself so I will with this one. This DVD goes beyond teaching signs for single words and teaches sentences such as ""What's your name?"" and ""How are you?"" Just like the DVDs in the first series the manner in which the signs are taught is simple, yet effective. The songs are catchy and I can't help but sing along. The DVD reintroduces some signs taught in the first series so if you have not seen previous volumes you won't be lost. The Signing Time DVDs are perfect for children of all ages- my son began watching them at around 18 months old and is now almost 4. His cousins are 8 and 10 and love them as well. I too have thoroughly enjoyed each one, and since learning a second language is more challenging for an adult I think the way the signs are taught has made it easy for me to learn and retain what I have learned. I have a friend who took 2 years of signing in college and barely remembers anything. She probably didn't learn them along with songs!",1462233600,,1118,4.228971962616822

8221866,5,B000W9DHJ0,"These are incredible!  Words can't really fully explain how this series has added so much color, knowledge, and value to my son's understanding of the world around him!  We started playing these for him at around 6 months old.  He loved watching the vibrant images and we both thoroughly enjoyed learning  more signs than what I had been teaching him on my own from the time he was born (milk, more, thank you, please). As he's gotten older and is now teaching me certain signs (he just turned 2), this was a nice next step for him.  He asks for this one specifically now and it's been a great segue into showing him how to approach a new person and how to interact with them.  He often tells me when he sees things that are ""alike"" and then uses the sign.  I can tell you that the ASL teaching intensely enhances his ability to understand new words.  There's something about the tactile aspect along with the verbal word that helps him comprehend the meaning.  He's currently learning how to shake hands (though the ""fist bump"" and ""high five"" are still his favorites) and it's been a wonderful way to talk to him about how to treat people.  It may not be quite as fun in the song department as most of the Series 2 DVDs, but neither of us have any complaints!  I plan to continue watching all of the Signing Time DVDs for many years to come!",1442188800,,1343,4.375
