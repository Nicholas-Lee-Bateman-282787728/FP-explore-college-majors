4513697,5,B00508W3OS,"1 of the greatest cartoons of the 80s, I still remember watching it on saturday mornings playing with my Mr. T toy, my eyes kinda get watery when I think of the nostalgia created by cartoons like Mr. T, GI-Joe, Rambo, Chuck Norris, Masters of the Universe, Super Powers Team, Gobots, Spiderman & his amazing friends, Incredible hulk, Transformers, & Thundercats, there will never be anything like 80s animation again, they had great plots, great music, intelligent words, & great drawings, also 80s cartoons weren't dumbed down like todays cartoons, there's not much you can go wrong on when you purchase 80s cartoons, especially if you are planning to buy the great Mr. T!",1357430400,11,673,4.912280701754386
4513698,4,B00508W3OS,"Wow, I didn't know this was out! My friend will go nuts!

This show was about Mr. T and a group of high school kids, he helps them with gymnastics; I can't remember if it was a gymnastics club or if he was an official teacher.
Anyway, they solve mysteries and fight crime with acrobatics, high flips, and of course Mr. T muscle!
Even the dog had a Mr. T mohawk!!!

And the best part was the awesome song!

4513699,4,B00508W3OS,I remember this cartoon from the 70's.  The episodes were well written but the need for an opening and closing commentary ruins it  for me.  Straight into the episode and out.  I hope Season 2 is released shortly.,1314489600,4,213,4.526315789473684
