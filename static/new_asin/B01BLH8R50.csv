7659868,4,B01BLH8R50,"First off, this movie is hardly a sequel or a prequel to 2008's Cloverfield. Maybe in some way, it's a spin-off. Only time will tell. 95% of the movie is its own thing. It's during the last ten minutes where it might come close to being related to the first movie. This review might contain some spoilers. I've heard that this film was originally known as The Cellar. At the last minute, the producers tweaked a few things to try and make it related to Cloverfield. The story itself was actually very good and very intriguing. When I saw the trailers, I didn't know what to expect. It's very driven by suspense, almost like that of a Hitchcock film. It's kind of a mix between Saw, Misery, and a film called Otis. John Goodman's character is scary at times. You never know when he's going to crack.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Live Free or Die Hard) stars as Michelle, a woman on the run from her broken relationship. During a car crash, she wakes up in Howard's underground bunker, chained to the wall. Howard tells her he saved her life and claims that the world outside is now uninhabitable due to the nuclear or chemical fallout from ""an attack."" (One thing I loved was that we never knew until the end if Howard was telling the truth, or making up crazy stories just to keep Michelle and another man, Emmett captive for himself.) Michelle tries to escape but soon learns that monsters come in many forms. I like that it was isolated and claustrophobic and mostly kept in one location as the three main stars bond, play games, listen to music and watch tv. In a weird way it reminded me of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead when the four friends were confined to the mall. At first, I was thrown off and let down by the twist in the last half, but my friend gave me his explanation and it make a little more sense. The film as a whole is definitely starting to grow on me. As I said, the movie is very driven by great suspense and some decent character development. It's like a great suspense classic from the 70's, but made for modern times. I would definitely recommend 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE!!!",1457740800,24,2116,4.453608247422681

In essence, a woman is driving away, when she gets into a serious traffic accident.  She wakes up chained in a bunker, where John Goodman tells her there was an attack, attacker not known, but everyone is dead.  There is another person there, with an injury.  He told her he got injured trying to get into the bunker, and had helped build the bunker.  So was there really an attack?  Was John Goodman telling the truth?

7659887,4,B01BLH8R50,"The movie has a lot of bad stripes considering the 'conclusion' of the series with the Netflix 'Cloverfield Paradox' flick. To be honest? The all work together pretty well. This movie keeps you guessing from beginning to end.

John Goodman is absolutely fantastic. He's listed as the antagonist but works so well to keep the movie fluid. Without giving anything away, he completely dominates the movie. It is very rare to see an actor or actress completely take a theme on and lose control of the the narrative so well as you see it done here. Few movies can really encapsulate the fear and paranoia that they grab here. It very readily reminds me of the original 'Alien' with how Goodman routes the whole thing.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead rockets up the whole tension. Her take, in character, is great and keeps the audience running in all the right directions.

All in all, if you're looking for a good thrill ride? This hits 9/10.",1520208000,,931,4.699386503067485

7659917,3,B01BLH8R50,"Not absolutely sure what I was supposed to think. The claustrophobia aspect was intriguing as a go to for suspense involving the human condition under extreme circumstances. But it seemed as if that was explored rather poorly as a plot device and character development tool. As one reviewer mentioned, I expected to see more of the background characterization of Goodman and the other fellow. What were his motives? What drives him?

Then...The transition from the claustrophobic internal horror of the bunker to the outside horror was a bit weak. This was no THE MIST, for an example, where this  was explored and delivered very successfully. What happened inside just seemed like a long and drawn out waiting for something to happen that eventually does but could have been plowed through much sooner than it was. It was anti-climatic. Was the horror story inside a prologue or The Story? Was the horror OUTSIDE just an epilogue???

 I'd have rather they drawn out the outside events and played off of the polarization of human to non human, and indoor claustrophobic to outdoor ""nowhere to run or hide with all of the space in the world at your disposal"" devices. But for some reason despite the numerous flaws I just couldn't stop watching. I gotta respect that!

I will try not to reveal too much here, in order to be courteous. I will start by saying that this movie is almost all suspense, with only a few scenes (instances or implications, really) of ""gore"". With that being said, I would say that is pretty much is appropriate for most people. The plot is somewhat slow moving, with your common questions being answered in almost cliche and annoyingly ambiguous ways, i.e., wondering what happened to somebody, then five seconds later a character in the movie asks the same question and someone else answers it directly.

Why doesn't she ever ask Howard ""If you're here to help me, why do I have to be chained up?""  She never comes out and directly asks that. Seems that is an obvious question that one would ask if someone is keeping you chained up but saved your life.  2. Did anyone else think of the fact that Howard was prepared and had everything in the bunker except for gas masks?  I realize it had to be omitted since she need to make one, but it seems silly since he had everything else including the acid.  You'd have acid but not a gas mask?  ***Now don't read if you haven't watched*** And the ending ---- turned the movie totally cheesy!  The movie was awesome up until this point.  It could have just ended with her realizing Howard was right and there was no one left on the planet.  Her living with her loneliness would have been more dramatic.  Her all of a sudden becoming this apocalyptic hero was unbelievable. I know, I know, she used to run from everything and now she's running ""into"" the drama.  I get the point.

Basically she's the reason that two people were dead and everything that came after the bunker felt completely contrived and convenient.

Its been a while since that movie, and actually this movie came out, but most of what I heard was that this movie was forgettable. However, I wanted to see for myself, and also was intrigued as to what the movie was going to provide in order to further the Cloverfield universe. I will say that I watched the trailer for this movie when it was coming out, so that takes out the first half hour of the movie. Ok now that I got that out of the way, the whole thing is pretty predictable and boring. As far as a suspenseful movie its pretty bad, story drags. I guess this would be suspenseful if you didn't know the original story line, since you will have certain gaps or not know one or two of the references. Not worth spending over an hour to get to the last 20 minutes to add something to the Cloverfield universe, the very last scene is an eye roller. PASS",1510444800,2,972,4.316939890710382

I generally like the ending, but I agree with other reviewers that the last 15 minutes seem to be a sudden change of pace and tone; like the movie abruptly switched gears and messed up the transmission.

I would like to start by saying that I did not hate this movie, it was actually very suspenseful and it kept me on the edge of my seat, the first half of the movie was great and I really enjoyed it, but the movie went downhill during the second half. First of all the acting was great but I felt like Michelle was a very bland character, She never smiled or laughed and barely talked. I think that if Emmet was the main character, the movie would be much more entertaining. Second of all some parts in the movie were just plain stupid; such as the part when Howard found Emmet hiding scissors and Emmet just flat out told the whole entire plan to Howard when he could've easily lied and gotten away with it, or the part when Michelle spills the barrel to stop Howard and he just falls, he was standing still, and he falls. Third of all the writers of this movie basically said ""**** it lets randomly make this an alien invasion movie."" The writers had Michelle escape the bomb shelter, and they could've just ended it there, but no they had to add an alien part that tries to be suspenseful, but fails miserably, and it was honestly kind of sad because I was really enjoying the movie and it's plot, but then this part happens and if you are reading this right now and never watched this movie before, pause it when she gets out of the shelter, the last part really ruined my experience but the first half was amazing and I would totally recommend it to anyone who likes mystery/suspense.",1503014400,4,1512,4.4

SPOILER ALERT

John Goodman makes a really great creepy, bearded old fat guy. Unfortunately the movie ends weakly when it turns out that, in addition to something INSIDE to be afraid of, there really is something OUTSIDE to be afraid of, too. The John Goodman bad guy piece of the plot never really gets resolved, except in the sense that he gets killed, not much thanks to the heroine. The existence of what we are to presume was a previous victim is just sort of mentioned, presumably to ratchet up the scare factor, and she's not woven into the plot the way she should be. Anyway when the heroine escapes she discovers that all along there has in fact been a whirling, toothed vortex monster outside. She decides to turn her escape car toward a city that needs help against it. The premise is interesting--are you better off facing the inside monster or the outside monster?--but the end is weak and neither plot is really tied up and finished off, which is what this particular genre of movie requires.",1502582400,,1034,4.6502732240437155

7660134,4,B01BLH8R50,I thought this movie was pretty good. John Goodman was awesome! It's like if you're friend's dad went off the rails. At first you're relieved to have someone take care of you and then enter the crazy.,1501977600,,200,4.4324324324324325
7660135,5,B01BLH8R50,"Without spoiling the movie by sharing what happens, this movie is better than the original Cloverfield but without all the non-stop action. The suspense of not knowing exactly which reality the bunker inhabitants are trying to survive, keeps you wondering. However, the biggest asset, (no pun intended) is by far John Goodman's portrayal of Howard the doomsday prepper. He should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for his performance in this film. Howard is a complex blend of antagonist, protagonist, full-blown creep, and emotionally childish and terribly lonely, older man with a penchance for survival and philosophical realism. The other two actors do a nice job as well but are completely overshadowed by Goodman's Howard, and rightly so. Watch it closely all the way to the end because you won't believe the ending. I watched it twice so far and still don't believe the ending. Waiting for the next Cloverfield-ish movie.",1501977600,,936,5.124183006535947
7660136,4,B01BLH8R50,"Good movie, worth a viewing. Alot of it IS predictable - and I could see the ending a mile awhile but only because the 'twist' endings

7660137,4,B01BLH8R50,"Not gonna lie, the last 15 minutes or so probably didn't need to be here. It could have been under a different name, and ended at that point in the movie, and it would have STAYED that suspenseful. However, it used the name ""Cloverfield"" to cover a wider audience that would be interested in seeing the next installment to a movie several years ago. 5/5 if it stopped before the last 20 minutes, but generic action sequences of conveniences really don't strike me as unique.",1501891200,,474,4.588235294117647

7660156,4,B01BLH8R50,"This is an excellent suspense movie with very smart concept.  The only thing that is annoying is the main female character--troubled personality and always seems to create problems for others.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I never heard of this movie or knew the kind of movie it is, so I was very well surprised to find this is a suspense thriller science fiction movie.  A female character leaves her husband because they got into a major argument, but then gets into a car accident only to wake up in a basement environment of John Goodman's farm.  It appears that John Goodman rammed his car into hers that caused the accident.  At first she was cuffed and locked into a room in this basement until she healed from her wounds.  That made her feel like this guy had kidnapped her.  However, he explains that she cannot leave this bunker that he built because their is an invasion outside and it could be the Russians or Aliens.  He was a Navy officer and satellite expert and recently heard that there have been some extra terrestrial activities or signals lately, but wasn't sure if that's what's causing the chemical warfare taking place.  He warns of the danger, and so she and another guy stays in the bunker with John Goodman's character until she keeps getting anxious to see the outside world.  She thinks she's being held captive and this whole thing is a lie, so she schemes an escape from this well stocked bunker.  The rest, you will have to find out as I was in suspense as to if the story John Goodman told is true, and what is really going on in the outside world.  Is this captivity or is he really saving her from a chemical warfare?",1501200000,,1655,4.48
7660157,5,B01BLH8R50,"Absolutely enjoyed this movie immensely. Of course, I'm a John Goodman fan, so, that's a given.

The ending was pretty implausible, I watched, kind of hoping it would click into something a little deeper, but it was pretty much a low budget, fairly watchable flick. If I could have the time back, to watch something else, I'd do it. Finally, what's with all the characters being from Louisiana, yet none of them having a trace of an accent? C'mon Hollywood, they could've been in North Dakota or Michigan, had they never mentioned where they were. Big mistake, IMHO.",1501027200,,556,4.742268041237113

7660245,1,B01BLH8R50,"Here was my first shot at a review:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't like to give away plot elements just in case someone is determined to see the movie, but how do I justify saying that this is one of the worst movies I'd ever had the displeasure to suffer through? If I hadn't been watching with someone else who wanted to see it, I'd've bailed after 10 minutes.  Bad movies have that stink about them.  Here's the plot:  John Goodman is a bad guy. No, he's a good guy.  But wait, he's a bad guy. Uhm, I mean a good guy. I mean, I mean,...well, he's one of those.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
but I couldn't believe how much time I was wasting trying to review a truly awful movie, as if anything I might say would matter.  So, I deleted it.  But then the appropriate review hit me, so I was able to recover my original review above and pair it with this...

There is one way in which this movie does not disappoint.  Every time you ask yourself (and there will be many such times) how this movie could get any worse...it gets worse!",1497052800,,1119,4.791666666666667
7660246,4,B01BLH8R50,"This movie was intense from beginning to the end. Some of the other reviews are pretty spot on. This tension is more of the dramatic setting tension, so action junkies might want to skip this one. However, thriller junkies this is your movie.",1497052800,,242,4.651162790697675
7660247,4,B01BLH8R50,"This movie has so many twists and turns until it's hard to keep up. John Goodman was in it, so I knew there would be something sick and sadistic in it. Hope there's a part two.",1497052800,,176,3.9166666666666665

7660274,4,B01BLH8R50,"Very good movie all along. The ending could have been better.
They have a good descriptive scenario of gaslighting and behavior control with fear tactics.

At the end when she escaped, the birds flew overhead and she realized that the air was safe to breath and it appeared as though her captor had gaslighter her about the invasion in order to keep her in fear of escaping from the bomb shelter where he had imprisoned her.

That should have been the end of the movie basically. Then she would have found someone to rescue her.

But they made the alien invasion part of her captor' s narrative turn out to actually be true. This deleted the power of the gaslighting scenario. Plus the aliens were very out of place in a story like this.

I like a good sci-fi story but this time is just seemed weird and ruined the ending.",1496188800,,823,4.430463576158941

7660276,3,B01BLH8R50,This movie was k but didn't seem to connect very much to the first cloverfield movie. The adding of aliens at the end was a pretty weak attempt to connect the two at the end. But I did like the acting of john goodman as the creepy shut in. The leading actress who I've seen in other films but still haven't locked in her name to memory did a good job also but in this movie left me feeling that many other actresses could of done the same or better. All in all I don't blame the actors in this case they made the best of a bad situation with the script they were given. I'm not saying it's a bad movie just not a instant classic and you don't need to see it more then once or add it to your collection. If you want to see something alittle interesting with a creepy character  that's well played by the lead actor and cheer on a strong female lead then you could do worst. As the 3 stars show it's just ok.,1496102400,,906,3.978021978021978

I have one burning question though about the choice of ""aliens"" they chose to use in this film....how did they build these intelligent flying objects with no hands?  The ""thing"" at the end of the movie looked to walk on all fours and have no opposing thumbs.  So how did this civilization that came from somewhere in space to take over earth and get rid of us, build aircraft to travel like that?  Just saying.

For awhile there I'm playing the guessing game, and can't tell if the girl is off or the guy that took her in.  There are so many twists and turns that pop up over the course of the film that those questions soon get answered.  What made this so riveting was John Goodman who played the suspicious guy.

I myself have seen Cloverfield and while the ending was exactly as expected, I still enjoyed this film.  The best part about this film is after the ending, whether you love it or find it ridiculous, you can still sit for hours thinking about what exactly was Howard's plan or did he even have one?  Was he right or wrong in the end?  Do you think Michelle is better off at the end or worse?

its a clever movie with a strong, non-damsel female lead, dominated by interwoven sub plots rather than the overall plot.  Very much like Cloverfield.  If you hated Cloverfield, its highly likely you will hate this as well.",1495411200,,759,4.522058823529412

7660321,3,B01BLH8R50,"I gave this three stars rather than fewer only because John Goodman is so superb in this role. The movie? Confusing. He saved the female lead's life from a demolition of the world, or so he tells her, but she wakes chained to the wall in a room that is metal and locked. As he eases up on her restrictions, along with a man who worked for him, also there, she discovers a 'help me', written in bloody fingernaild, facing out for someone to read, behind a window cover along with an earing. The earing is on the ear of a photo of a young woman John Goodman has identified as his daughter but his former worker tell her, no, it was a picture of a neighbor who disappeared two years earlier. Everything points to this being a hoax, a trap. In the last ten minutes of the movie everything turns around. I found the ending disappoimting and inconsistent with the rabid, murderous character John Goodman plays (yes, he kills the former worker for stealing scissors to make a weapon). Given more believable foreshadowing or a different ending, this could have been great.",1495152000,,1064,4.518134715025907

I was enthralled, wondering if he really did kill his child and the young girl that went to school with her, and just when you think he's made it all up (the attack on America), you see a woman affected by the gas and you know something was definitely going on out there! But it doesn't really wrap up those missing persons questions and I wish it had. It didn't dive into his character enough.

The ending, it was just tragically awful. I didn't realize this was an alien sci fi movie when I began watching it and I wasn't at all impressed. I gave it three stars for the first 3/4 of the movie, though!",1495065600,,701,4.2706766917293235

Although there are hints at this, we don't get to explore it because instead the writers chose to set us up for the unexpected finale. Unfortunately the finale is mediocre, and as a result we learn nothing about Howard or why Michelle ended up in her predicament.",1494979200,4,428,4.5
7660325,5,B01BLH8R50,"I'm sitting here shocked that I'm giving this movie 5 stars and writing such praise. I initially thought it would be another Whatever Happened to Baby Jane and Misery knockoff. Maybe the idea came from there, but this movie went way, way beyond that and fully developed into its own originality. It is 100% unique.

The movie was so intelligently written that, after reading many of the reviews, I can only assume it just flew right over most people's heads. One could argue that even if that were the case, it isn't good movie making because it should reach people much more successfully than it did. In some cases I would agree, as I think it depends on the movie and so in this case I disagree. This is one of those very rare diamonds in the rough that is so good at what it did, many people rejected it subconsciously at some point.

It dared go where a lot of expectations would not, except that of the most open minded and continuously interested.

I kind of expect more from Hollywood with suspense thrillers, that's why they get graded a little tougher.  All that millions of dollars and you contain it all in one little location..?  That's a low budget indy film making move mister Hollywood.. you stay out of that and give me high dollar production value.. more than people sitting around talking.  It's kinda like when Zach Braff or Spike Lee did a kickstarter campaign and got all those suckers to give these millionaires money for free and no ownership.  Sure, it was legal and yes, they brought awareness to the platform from otherwise dumb people.. but NO.. they should stuck with asking for cash from their rich friends.

The sincerity he portrayed went BOTH ways, (positive and negative), and just when you think you know what's going on, he says something else to turn the story,  Again.

7660373,5,B01BLH8R50,"This has become one of my favorite movies of recent times. I have watched it four times now, and it is just as good each time. John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are both OUTSTANDING in this unique sci-fi/horror thriller. Plenty of jump scares and plot twists to keep you guessing, and more than enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is one suspenseful sci-fi flick.

I never provide spoilers because that is so unfair to those who have not seen the movie. It involves a man who has built a bomb shelter under his farm. A former navy man who worked closely with satellites (a long-shot tie into Cloverfield, but that is about the extent of it), Goodman has prepared a bunker in case of nuclear or chemical attacks.

He, Winstead, and a third actor must weather what they believe might have been a nuclear attack from the Russians or North Koreans. They accept that they will have to remain under ground a year or two to avoid any fallout.

At first they get along like a small, happy family, with a few minor glitches, of course. But then things start to get real, and you will never see it coming until it's too late!  The entire theater responded with jumps and screams, repeatedly. This is an excellent movie to see with others, or watch alone....unless it is eerily dark and creepy at your place.....never mind....you'll be just....fine.....really......",1493856000,13,1383,4.655737704918033

I am always asking ""What if?"" questions and this film's mysterious premise centered on an apocalyptic collapse of society hooked me from the beginning because it fits into thinking about what could be in the future. Now, I thought the premise was airtight and the cast was amazing, but the storyline focused way too much on the film's characters and not on the apocalyptic environment surrounding them. That would be my only complaint with this film. Make your own opinion on this unique film today by watching at least the first twenty minutes of it.",1493164800,,646,4.828828828828829
7660388,5,B01BLH8R50,"What a great suspenseful movie. It is the spiritual successor to the first Cloverfield movie, but it definitely has a better ending than the first one.

The movie is about fighting back. No matter what the situation or thing is, you gotta fight back. Obviously in general story telling 101, there's gonna be a conflict and the story is about the build up and how the protagonist deals with that conflict. Well in this movie, you're gonna be cheering for our heroine all the way. I love her and I love this movie. You go girl!",1493164800,,525,4.46875

7660394,4,B01BLH8R50,"I recently watched this movie with my girlfriend. She hadn't seen or heard of Cloverfield and had no idea this movie existed. It had been years since I had seen Cloverfield as well so it was kind of like we both went into this blindly, which I think is a great way to watch this. John Goodman is once again great and delivers a wonderful performance. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great, I first saw her in 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' which is one of my favorite movies now. This movie is a slow burn that's hard to categorize as a horror, sci-fi, thriller or drama. It's got elements of a whole lot of different genre and that only adds to its allure. It's best to approach this film not expecting anything, I enjoyed it.",1493078400,,721,4.348148148148148

The plot is a little predictable, but it was done in a way that the predictfullness actually adds to the enjoyment, especially up to the twist in the plot.  Don't worry, I am not about to give anything away!

Also, for some reason, we never saw this in the theater, but I think we enjoyed it more because we watched it at home.  This is definitely not a ""big screen"" movie, and being able to pause and get up and examine something or even laugh or talk about a scene made the movie that much more enjoyable.",1493078400,3,586,4.290909090909091

Mary Elisabeth Winstead is great as a woman who does not give up even when what she faces is seemingly beyond her. Tightly paced suspense/thriller that I recommend ro anyone who enjoys movies that aren't the same formulaic stories we see every year at the theatre.",1492473600,2,500,4.5054945054945055

Then, upon emerging from her safe bunker which was provided by a chivalrous male stranger, she finds that every life threatening danger she was warned of is real. Then relying on male inventions she is able to flee and protect herself for a limited time. At the end of the movie the female protagonist is given a choice between possible freedom and a call for help. In a vain attempt at redemption she chooses to drive toward the call for help. Probably because she knows that there will be more male victims waiting.",1492387200,,758,4.664179104477612

7660434,1,B01BLH8R50,"I honestly don't understand how anyone could like this. This is nothing more than a cheap cash-in on the Cloverfield name. This has absolutely nothing to do with the original monster movie. While that one barely showed the creature, at least they had one. This movie is nothing similar to its namesake, except for the title and some crappy bug CGI at the end.

If the movie makers didn't want to shamelessly cash-in, this movie wouldnt be so bad. John Goodman delivers an excellent performance. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is just as wooden as ever. The story itself wouldve been much better if Cloverfield was completely omitted from the film. It was good enough to stand on its own. But the second you link it to a monster movie and then don't have any monster, you instantly lose.",1492128000,,779,4.686131386861314
7660435,3,B01BLH8R50,"Reviewing this movie without spoilers is almost impossible for me, but I will try. First, the cast all give excellent performances. Second, the movie is shot and edited very well. Third, the soundtrack enhanced the movie wonderfully. Now for the bad. The last act changes the movie's tone so much that I was very disappointed with it. Here lies the dilemma. Telling you anything more will ruin what the director obviously wanted to achieve. Nevertheless, I would watch most of this movie again - just not the end.",1492128000,2,513,4.840909090909091

One would think that this is yet another horror movie with a woman escaping the clutches of a psychopath, but this movie is not a traditional horror movie.  in fact I'm not even sure what genre to call this.  Suspense is probably the most accurate choice.  Unfortunately I am unable to clarify what exactly happens in the movie that makes it so great without spoiling it.  the most I can say is that toward the end/during the climax the movie takes a completely different turn.  In a time where every movie made is a ""reboot"" or ""clich rip off of each other,"" this movie is actually worthy of being called an original.",1492128000,,667,4.426229508196721

This one kept me interested as I was never sure about Goodman, weird but was he right or not?  He is a survivalist (at any cost) explaining his killing the boy to protect his safety and survival-made a big mistake in revealing the hydro chloric acid but it was obviously meant to be. Nice comic relief when she first sees the alien spaceship. Superb acting: A+. Story line: B; good, but somewhat predictable though not enough to chase me away prematurely.",1491955200,2,600,4.815533980582524

7660446,4,B01BLH8R50,"From the director that gave us that nifty Portal fan film a few years ago, Dan Trachtenberg has come a long way. A great premise and a marketing campaign that suggested links to 2008s Cloverfield, the film is its own entity with a theater like quality, richly developed characters, and a survival story that echoes Z for Zachariah. Be prepared for a fantastic final climax. Highly recommended.

7660465,4,B01BLH8R50,"This movies direction, acting (especially by John Goodman), cinematography, and music were excellent. And the writing was excellent until the last ten minutes, then I don't what happened to the quality. There were three twists near the end; the first two were extremely well done; and the last twist had a great idea to work off of, but after that twist, the resolution was preposterous.

SPOILER ALERT: The female protagonist, a twenty-something dress designer, suddenly exhibited the skills and quick thinking of a James Bond, Jason Bourne, or Jack Bauer. And the ending could have been stretched out to build the suspense and explain why certain things were happening. It was if the writers, director, and producers couldn't agree on a wow ending, so they decided to just get the ending over with ASAP. A real shame.

Goodman has a fantastic bunker and takes in two survivors of an apocalyptic event though it isn't clear to anyone what is actually happening on the outside.

SPOILER: my takeaway is that communication is vital, keep talking, and don't shut the other person out. It is okay to have doubt on things we don't understand, but we should verify it patiently and clarify before assuming the worst of someone else. To verify, there are often multiple ways if we spend time to think, and in this case, carefully observing the outside world, e.g. spending time looking out the window may be with protective suit. When we just discredited everything the other person say and stop listening, misunderstanding becomes tragedy.

I skimmed the reviews because I don't like wasting my time on crap endings (""Lost"" has scarred me for life) but I couldn't find the spoilers I was looking for, so I just watched it.

  Which leads us to secondly, this is a solid flick.  If you're looking for something entertaining to watch, hit that play button!  So, why 3 stars, I found myself hitting the skip ahead 10secs button several times.  So in some places the movies was, for me, a little slow.

Third, I wanted to slap (figuratively) the main actress several times for her poor decision making skills.  Yes I understand the story called for her actions but I still thought she could have gone about them a lot differently.  I wouldn't want her watching my back.

Most of the film is a bad bunker story about a girl who is mostly too stupid to live as she tries to fend off the one (admittedly giant wierdo) person who has saved her.

The first act is a very slow and boring section of you saying, ""Well, this girl is going way off the deep end real quick, but maybe her fears are justified,"" except it is dragging to tears. The second act is you saying, ""Well gee, I guess the weirdo guy is right and maybe they should listen to him, since, yeah he's right."" The third act is spirals into an escaping from safety so we can find some reason to pay millions of dollars to animate fancy looking aliens that are flying super monsters yet can easily be killed with a bottle of single malt liquor (it doesn't even take the good stuff).

And if that sounds like an inconceivable mess of a film that is a waste of two hours of your life - good news! It feels like four hours....",1491091200,,1056,4.047846889952153

7660512,3,B01BLH8R50,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Let me tell you some things you need to know before watching it. I will try not to spoil the movie for you by telling you everything that happens in it. This had the potential to be a really good psychological suspense mystery movie. The cover of the movie pulls you in. I have never seen such a wonderful movie cover that made me want to watch the movie based off of the cover alone. It doesn't take long to get into this movie. The main character is a very good actor and she really pulled you into the movie along with the other two male actors. Here is where the problems came in:

The movie kept flipping between plots. A lot of movies want to add mystery and keep the audience guessing. That is a good thing if the movie is well produced and the script was well thought out. I think the movie wanted to keep you guessing but there was not enough intellectual wit to pull that off. So the movie just seemed crazy and going into too many directions. Was the movie a murder mystery, was it a kidnapping, was it a psychological thriller or was it a science fiction novel? There was just too many things going on. I think if the writer would have just focused on one or two specific aspects they wanted to put in the movie it would have been better. The talent was there because I could see it but the movie focused on too many things. Some producers and writers can pull that off but it has to be well written, good actors and the right timing.

The movie kept me on the edge of my seat though. it was a good movie and you will be able to get through it. But at the end I just think the ending was rushed. And it really just didn't seem believable. This movie gave me mixed feelings because I could see the potential and the talent but it fell short. I just wish it has a better plot and was given a little more budget to make it a good movie like I felt like it was supposed to be. I have to say the actors are good but the plot didn't allow them to reach their full potential in the movie. Because of the great acting I give this movie 4 stars but the because the plot was not there I had to keep it at 3 stars.",1490918400,2,2155,4.056338028169014

I read a few of the 1 and 2 reviews and these people are obviously not real bright or, what you would call creative thinkers. If you want a predictable movie, this is not it. If you want a movie that is mysterious, leaves you guessing right up to the end, and doesn't wrap up everything in a neat little package with warm fuzzies, this may be your cup of tea  John Goodman is masterful and shows his range as an actor. If you are tuning in to see him playing his usual offbeat, cheerful character from The Blues Brothers or The Big Lebowski, this is not that either. John plays the disturbed protagonist and is really good. The acting is exceptional and Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. are believable and work with Goodman to create tension. This movie depends upon actual acting, character development and suspense. Explosions and effects are in short supply until the end. Any idiot can make a movie filled with chases and explosions. It takes a great script, great acting and good direction to create a suspenseful thriller with 3 actors in a bunker. I liked the movie very much.

7660571,3,B01BLH8R50,"An interesting, gripping, and suspenseful film (after the first several minutes) with an odd, illogical premise. This film blends elements from ""Aliens"", ""Saw"", ""The Human Centipede"", and ""Lost"", and does an excellent job making you guess if there really was a fallout as the main male character claims. The last several minutes answers that question but has some flaws:

Flaw #1: If the aliens have advanced technology, then why use poison gas on us humans? Why not lasers or more devastating weapons with more immediate damage?
Flaw #2: The main female character is exposed to the poison gas for several minutes, but nothing seems to happen to her.

This film doesn't seem to have any connection to the other movie ""Cloverfield"" which was an awful movie compared to Gareth Edwards' version of ""Godzilla"". Is ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" worth watching? Yes, but don't pay to own it, because it's more of a made-for-TV movie.",1490313600,,919,5.0

As dumb as I thought the movie turned out to be, Goodman portrayed his role 'small.' He was not too crazy, considering the topic. He never went too over the top, which I thought kept the suspense about the believability of his character in question. A nice touch. All through the film, I  was disappointed at the 'fast' friendship between Emmit and Michelle. Too much trust too soon. The ending (which began as she escaped) was sketchy and implausible, given what you learn to be the truth. Considering the MacGyver-ish tendencies of Michelle, Emmitt was too stupid and Michelle wore too much makeup freshly applied",1490140800,,764,4.7443609022556394

7660597,5,B01BLH8R50,"If you're lucky enough to not have had this movie spoiled yet, watch it as soon as possible.
The premise is that a young woman (Winstead) finds herself in a bunker after being in a car crash. The man who owns the bunker (Goodman) tells her he's saved her, and that the end of the world has come. The rest of the movie is a roller-coaster of events that leave you constantly reeling between the two possibilities: was the apocalypse real, or is this just the work of an insane kidnapper?
The suspense makes this movie perfect fare for a Halloween viewing. The only criticism I could give is that Winstead's role here comes off as extremely similar to her part in ""The Thing"" (2011). But at least her character is likable and believable. She's not quite MacGyver (though it gets close sometimes), but she is definitely a common-sense-smart determined and strong character. Goodman also very effectively portrays a man who, one one hand, might be a quirky genius, and on the other, might be a brilliant psycho.
The movie has minimal bad language, brief frightening gore, and no sexual content whatsoever.",1490054400,5,1101,4.739583333333333

What I will say is I really hope they make a sequel.

Apparently this is a _______film. I don't want to spoil it by giving away the genre because that is infact where things start to get more than interesting. The maker of this film/story has a knack for bringing unexpected thing into one interesting collage.

Goodman came of as a man who needed some psychological help.  Under the circumstances, I would have wanted to get out myself.  I would have wanted some kind of proof, that he wasn't supplying.
They never answered why he presented some other child as his own, nor the bloody earring.

Before anything else, I want to say that the acting was amazing! Great job from all three actors. Having said that, I would have given this movie a 5 star, but the ending ruined it for me. Up until the point, where she gets out of the bunker, it was a suspenseful psychological thriller. And I loved it. It should have stayed that way. Then the alien thing was just weird. It made the antagonist look like the good guy, who really just wanted to save her, but then she killed her own savior. This made the movie confusing. I would have ended it by the lead character discovering that what she saw in the window of the door was a pre-recorded projection, and not a woman dying. And that the pigs were fake too, and it was all just pre-recorded film to keep her in the bunker. That would have made the antagonist really really evil. Otherwise, her ending up in a bunker with a mentally ill serial killer is just a sad coincidence. That takes away from the scare factor.",1489190400,,996,4.331550802139038

In this movie there's an obvious life metaphor about deciding whether to get out and participate in the world or stay hidden where it's ""safe"".

I'd heard people pan the ending before watching this, and now that I've seen it, I agree with them; the movie should either end a bit earlier when a certain important something happens or just have something different happen.

Good acting and plot lines, great suspense.  After the main turning point, this movie is a complete joke and the ending basically nullifies the entire previous build-up.

7660757,5,B01BLH8R50,"Firstly, I recommend not reading too many reviews, as people are being a bit heavy-handed with hints and outright spoilers, and this movie is all about the mysteries.

Anyway, I absolutely love this movie, and I hadn't really expected to. I thought it would be a hollywood cash grab at what the original was, but it is so good.

I notice that a lot of reviews complain about the ending, but I loved it, and I think that most people who loved the original Cloverfield will be on board. There are some things about the movie that could be jarring to people who have never seen the first one, but I think that if you have seen the first movie then you will be a-okay with it.

You can understand this movie without watching Cloverfield, and it isn't super tightly related, but I recommend watching Cloverfield first nonetheless. And, optionally, if you want to get really in depth, listen to the cloverfeels podcast or otherwise read up on the ARG (alternate reality game) surrounding the films after watching the original Cloverfield but before watching this movie.

This movie keeps you guessing the whole way through, and its protagonist is smart as a tack and not a horror movie pushover stereotype. The horror comes from the situation, not from characters being stupid. And this is yet another refreshing example of recent blockbuster films with great female leads.

Also, incidentally, that one reviewer who said the film is somehow about gender politics and about the lead not trusting men was smoking something.

Now, there were a handful of things that bugged me about the movie, particularly an overuse of music effects for artificially building tension, but compared to the movie's triumphs my gripes are small.",1488585600,8,1719,4.849829351535837

7660792,4,B01BLH8R50,"This movie keeps the viewer in suspense right through to the end.  John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr.  are excellent in their roles.

I didn't read much about this movie before watching it and, in this case, that made a huge difference.  Just when I thought I knew what was happening, there was another surprising twist.

Its best when spoilers are avoided and when this movie is watched without any expectations or knowledge of the outcome",1487980800,,466,4.848101265822785

7660796,3,B01BLH8R50,This movie is okay. John Goodman plays a mysterious character in this film. It starts off very slow and a bit boring. The characters appear awkward in their scenes and the dialogue is strained and tentative. The suspense and action definitely pick up halfway through the movie when the plan for an escape is implemented. The resourcefulness displayed by the characters are impressive and the background music adds to the suspense. What is also interesting is that this could be a movie within another movie as we discover the reason for them being in this bunker style enclosure. Is it an apocalyptic attack or something else? There are many surprises and perilous situations for these characters but the ending could have been better.,1487980800,2,735,4.983739837398374

7660799,4,B01BLH8R50,"This is a very entertaining thriller about a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is knocked unconscious in a car crash.  She wakes up in a bunker belonging to Howard (John Goodman), a survivalist who may or may not have the best intentions towards her.  The movie does a great job at keeping you in suspense about Howard's motivations and the state of the outside world until the best possible moment.  This has a lot to do with the prime combination of Dan Trachtenberg's claustrophobic direction and J.J. Abram's adventure video game-like puzzles.  Hopefully, this movie will lead to Winstead getting more juicy roles like she has in this one.",1487721600,,666,4.919642857142857

7660802,4,B01BLH8R50,"For the most part, this movie is a well-written thriller that relies on tight plotting and good acting all-around. John Goodman is especially effective, gruff and goofy and ultimately very frightening without recourse to any exaggeration in his performance. As usual in horror these days, there is some subtext about current social values. In this case, Goodman (I believe) comes to represent the fading order of the patriarchal male with his insistence on obedience and family cohesion no matter what the cost. The deep contradictions in his character--especially his grip on reality--make for very compelling viewing.

However, I think the movie's last 20-30 minutes suffer from overly literal detail and some really cheesy CGI. The CGI was so fake that I wondered if maybe onscreen events were a dream--but apparently not. Our heroine rides off into the storm cloud to do heroic battle with those invading alien forces.

Definitely see it for Goodman. And in case you're wondering, this movie has no relation to Cloverfield.",1487462400,,1027,5.218181818181818

7660807,3,B01BLH8R50,"I must say that this movie was suspenseful, nail-biting and it kept me on the edge of my seat. But I wish there was more - just like the original Cloverfield, they should have had *that* happen sooner rather than later... I think that the other reviewers about summed it up but I would like to point out a few things...

***Spoiler Alert***

Michelle gets a call from her fiance, Ben. Why were we not shown a backstory of why she was leaving him or pretty much what he looked like. She answered his first call and he begged her not to leave - would liked to have known what happened to cause her to ignore him.

She wakes up in a cell - right foot chained to the wall. Then there's cranky Howard who scared the crap outta me - when he makes his first appearance, my jaw dropped when he said ""I'm going to keep you alive"" like who are you??

Howard (to me) was an insane old man who needed to be locked away in an asylum. I wondered for how many years he had been stocking up that bunker because he was fully stocked. Every time that Howard mentioned bad things happening outside, I laughed (insanity check) but when Michelle does eventually leave the bunker - everything made sense...

Don't want to spoil this movie for others - like I said, I enjoyed it but I wanted more on the ending - just one scene with *that* was not enough for me. Other than that, it was a good watch.",1487203200,,1377,4.200757575757576

A huge man unlocks the door to her room and tells her that he has rescued her. She doesn't know whether he is crazy, a serial killer or telling the truth.

Howard, the man, tells her that the end of the world has happened. Everyone is dead from an apocalypse that is either a war, chemical weapons, radiation, aliens, and invasion or a plague. All Michelle wants is to escape this crazy man as she doesn't believe what he is saying. She thinks he will murder her if she doesn't escape..

This was an interesting film, not great but not totally bad. The acting is good and the intensity of the storyline can keep you on the edge of your seat at times. I will not ruin the story for you. I rated it as a 3 star. This film could have been so much more and it is set up to have a follow-up film.

Full of suspense, twist and turns, and incredibly tense plotting and acting, I bought this on Amazon Video because it is such a strong film, and one that will hold up to multiple viewings.

7661008,4,B01BLH8R50,"I loved this movie. I really did. Well, almost. **SPOILERS**

It opens with a woman driving, having some disagreement with her boyfriend, and then a sudden car accident that leaves her unconscious, only to wake up in a mysterious and unwelcoming cellar room chained to a pipe. Is she kidnapped? What is going on? And that is basically where you are left up until the end. There are so many perception shifts in this film that you don't know what is real anymore. John Goodman plays a seemingly honest and good-intentioned person that he is helping this woman, not only back to life, but also from the supposed attacks going on above them (we discover she is in a bunker).

So here is where my SPOILER comes in. The ending. I loved the movie. I loved it to the end. Not the very end. But up to the point where she discovers what is really out there. And it changes everything that has happened before hand. Or gives clarity to it. Needless to say, once she discovers what is out there, does the film really need to go on for 10 more minutes? I felt as if this was a lazy extension told by producers to give the audience a little pizzaz. And I think it falls short by giving too much. Did she really come up with a molotov cocktail in the last 30 seconds only to throw it in the mouth ala Independence Day? Would she have survived the truck falling after the alien let go of it? Whether there was a war or not, just her getting out of the bunker and seeing the horror of the truth would be enough for the films end. Not the rest. So, that is why I give this 4 stars. Otherwise, a top notch film with excellent acting by everyone and well directed.",1480809600,5,1645,4.252396166134186

There is no way to talk about the main flaws of this film without spoiling it so read at your own risk.

The biggest flaw with this film is the 2 directions it trying to go at the same time ... is it a suspenseful hostage drama? is it a sci-fi aliens flick ... OH its pretending to be the former but is actually the latter.  A lot of the dialogue is written to make it seem like it's a hostage drama ""a'la Shamalan"" but when the cats out of the bag and the big reveal occurred I was left with an overwhelming sense of WTF!!!!?.  Somehow our main protagonist also becomes Ripley + MacGyver all in one and wins at the end ... fighting off some kind of biological disease with vinal, duct tape, a 2ltr bottle and I am guessing some medical disinfectant pad ..... yeah, I didn't buy it ... but hey ... ITS A FEEL GOOD MOMENT .... Also, they made John Goodman's character into a creep when in the end he was kind of right .... so there is that ...

7661061,4,B01BLH8R50,"The movie kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire time.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it left me guessing as to what direction the movie was going.  And if it wasn't for one thoughtless reviewer who posted the ending of the movie in her review, I would have enjoyed it even more.

4 stars for not the greatest suspense/horror movie I've ever seen, but it was more than just okay....I liked it (4 stars)
John Goodman is such a good actor, he had me guessing as to what his true intentions were, but there were plenty of clues along the way.
If I had to pick anything to improve on the movie, I thought some of the scenes were a little too predictable.  Like the way Goodman's character would sneak up on them while they were planning something.  You could just tell he was going to pop out at them.

Anyway, the movie is at least worth watching once.  I often judge a move by how many repeated times I'll watch it.  Like Alien and The Bird Cage, I've watched at least two dozen times each.  This one I'll probably watch at least two or three more times.

And one final request for other reviewers, please don't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it.  Or at least write ""SPOILERS"" at the beginning of your review.  Don't just blurt out the ending without telling people you're going to ruin it for them.  That's really inconsiderate!",1479686400,330,1354,4.368
7661062,3,B01BLH8R50,"I started watching this because it was supposed to be a sequel to the found-footage film, Cloverfield. It was actually entertaining, or at least captivating, without any giant monsters or shaky-cam; watching the three actors interact in a closed-circle setting where one of them turns out to be hiding secrets, well, that got pretty tense, and I really wanted to know what happened next. Honestly, the movie could have been 20 minutes shorter and not suffered.
The last 20 minutes feels like it was spliced in from another movie; twists only work if they are backed up by a groundwork of hints throughout the film, and this film just didn't have that groundwork. It might as well have ended with ""surprise - they were all made of candy!"". A disappointing conclusion to an otherwise solid thriller.

I think they were trying to surprise us with a twist-ending, but a twist only works if, after the reveal, there's a sense of pieces falling into place as the hints the movie has been dropping suddenly make sense. That never happened here; there was one hint, and it was super-vague",1479686400,,1080,4.775401069518717

7661072,1,B01BLH8R50,"I agree that the movie, ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" is a well-made and well-acted thriller. But, it has a glaring error in plot design that fundamentally ruins this film that goes beyond all forgiveness! If Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character, ""Michelle,"" is extraordinarily superficial, it may not be that actress's own fault. Apparently, Winstead plays her character to the hilt. But, knowing whether Winstead is aware of her character's stupidity or not seems impossible to tell. Is Winstead really as deluded as her character or just acting as deluded? Irrelevant, nevertheless. The only character who has any sanity whatsoever is her antagonist, ""Howard,"" played by John Goodman so well that it's Oscar-level. And, when a screenwriter's bad guy in a movie is not only more interesting, but also more sane than the main character, it's time for that screenwriter to start looking for other work.

SPOILERS FOLLOW: Michelle, the character, is so dumb that she manages in the height of a worldly apocalypse to blow up the nuclear bunker she lives in, making herself homeless, kill off Howard, the guy that saved her by inviting her into a bunker that he designed and built, and get another guy killed whom Howard also saved as well. Howard is the good guy, and Michelle is the moron who gets everyone killed over her paranoid delusions. The point of the movie is not to tell this movie's audience that Michelle is suffering from grossly superficial paranoia for the point of getting the audience to become as grossly superficial as she is. My suffering this film began not later on, but in nearly the first scene! Through the entire movie, Michelle is a criminally-negligent and malignant retard from the very opening credits! Nothing she thinks is happening is going on, and, even as she learns of her own paranoia, she continuously ignores that centerpiece, as the level of her stupidity snowballs into getting everyone killed, almost herself, too. Criminal negligence!

CONTAINS SPOILERS: What do aliens have to do with this? Well, no matter what proof she finds that Howard is being a good man, if a humanly imperfect one, she ignores everything in reality. And, the more proof she finds, the more criminally negligent she is! This movie has Howard saving another guy and her by inviting them into his underground bunker, when he could have let them die outside instead, presumably saving them for human companionship and for moral reasons, making Howard the only character with a conscience! Now, how can a movie be good when the good girl protagonist is a criminal and the bad guy is the one with all the morals?

After blowing up her own living area and killing the builder that saved her and someone else he'd saved, the movie nears its end. She conveniently turns on the radio to hear someone speaking about the existence of a resistance against the alien invaders and that resistance's location. Having barely escaped her own direct contact with one of the aliens, she decides to set off in that direction, rather than away from the aliens. What does this mean? A sane viewer un-impeached by Michelle's criminal paranoia should deduce from these facts that, after the movie ends, she's going to screw up the human race's last chances of survival! Because, her criminality only grows through the course of this film. So, how is one to expect it would not continue to grow? This movie has the dumbest protagonist in the history of protagonists and the brightest, most-enlightened antagonist in the history of antagonists. This movie is about how her superficial paranoia kills him instead of his morality saving her! She's so dense, how the heck is she supposed to save the human race from extinction when she can't even save herself from her own paranoia?

I did not believe that the female character had what it took to get free. Nope. Sorry. I cant believe that she had the underlying strength do what I can only explain as a series of blind luck. Where's her quiet strength? Quick thinking and survival skills were no where to be found in her deck of cards. Her character needed depth and a set of skills from her past that would come in handy.

If there is, we will do the Redbox thing and rent it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has one super Milla Jovovich moment when you least expect it; she's a real scrappy babe. One thing is for sure...Howard (John Goodman) really knows how to build a bomb shelter, complete with DVDs, board games, crafts, and a CD Jukebox!  Who could ask for anything more?

It reminded me of a bad version of a Rod Serling sci fi. Naturally, they had to perv it up, because that's vogue.

Happened? Did they run out of money? Did someone have an emergency and *HAVE* to wrap up by a given day? I don't know, but the movie was pretty okay until the final scenes and then it turned into a P.O.S. I mean, a complete P.O.S. Like they handed the movie to a blindfolded 6th grade class and told them to finish it up while the real crew took off to start a ""real"" movie that would get them a 3-star rating. I rate this movie 1 Star for the first 3/4 of the movie and 1 star for getting me to actually pay for it. They deserve something for that great feat.",1478304000,,735,4.146853146853147

Where the first movie was more sprawling in its depiction of an enormous threat only partially glimpsed, this is a tightly bound chamber piece where, for a majority of the movie, the threat and the seriousness of the threat is all too human and not alien at all.  The drama and delivery make the ending all the more shocking.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead is wonderful in her role, as is John Goodman as someone you definitely wouldn't want to be trapped in a bomb shelter with.  Whether this is the start of a long episodic film series or a trilogy that culminates in a war of the worlds, JJ Abrams continues to excel as the premier director/producer/storyteller in science fiction in our day.",1477872000,,860,4.6381578947368425

7661201,3,B01BLH8R50,Great acting by John Goodman. His character is very convincing and adds to the suspense and tension of the plot. The storyline is great and then it takes a complete 90 degree turn in the last 10 minutes. The last 10 minutes ruined it.

7661202,5,B01BLH8R50,One of the better thriller/horror/ apocalypse movies I've seen in a long time. It keeps you guessing the whole way. If you're expecting it be like the original Cloverfield you might not like it but it was worth the watch regardless.,1476748800,,232,4.682926829268292

The actors/acting was great and the story was suspenseful like I hoped but the ending completely threw me off which is why I could not give it five stars.

He does an excellent portrayal of a man seized with fear and coming to terms with living underground after an ""attack"" on the Earth.  Sure, he seems bat shiz crazy but ... wouldn't we all be a little bit???  The ending was a tremendous letdown for me and I won't put up any spoilers.  I will just say that if you like post apocalyptic to kind of alien type take over movies, this would be your type of thing.  HOWEVER - the ending ... IS an enormous slap in the face to all the work that was done throughout the rest of the movie.  It just ... no.  It doesn't sit well with me at all.  John Goodman steals the show here.  This is not Dan Conner from Roseanne.  This is the complete opposite of him in every way, shape, and form.  He is not funny.  He is creepy, not normal, and I LOVE every minute of it!!!

7661288,5,B01BLH8R50,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is one of those films you should know as little as possible about before you watch it.  Part of the enjoyment comes in trying to figure out what is going on while the main character is doing the same, so the less you know about it before you start watching it, the better.

One thing you should know is that this is NOT  I repeat  this is NOT a sequel to ""Cloverfield.""  In fact, this film is even more enjoyable if youve never seen ""Cloverfield"" at all, since it has nothing to do with it.  It is, as has been described elsewhere, a thematic sequel to that movie, meaning both films have similar survivalist elements, but that is all.  ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is so much better than ""Cloverfield"" that I would recommend you either watch ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" before you watch ""Cloverfield"" or -- even better -- watch ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" INSTEAD OF ""Cloverfield.""  (See my spoiler-heavy review of ""Cloverfield"" as to why).

What can I say about ""10 Cloverfield Lane""?  Brilliant story, brilliant acting, and plot twists you WILL NOT see coming which is why I don't want to spoil them here.  I look forward to more ""Cloverfield"" movies, so long as they are more like this one instead of the original.",1475280000,,1221,4.606481481481482

Earlier in this film, the main character Michelle, tells another character that her way to solve problems she faces is to run away. That will be an important point

Michelle has had an argument with her fiance and, as is her habit when faced with trouble, proceeds to pack and leave. As she drives, ignoring his phone calls and an announcement on the radio that there are blackouts on the Eastern Seaboard, theres a thump, her car goes off the road and over turns. She awakens in a concrete bunker, chained to a wall, rescued from the car by a man named Howard who tells her the world she knows has been destroyed by invaders and he has saved her life.  Theres a young man named Emmett, also injured, though he corroborates Emmetts story to some extent, claiming he got injured trying to get into the bunker before the attack.  Michelles memories come back and she realized Howard forced her off the road. Howard also confesses this.  Other discrepancies in his story make Michelle and Emmett decide to escape

This summary sounds mundane, for it cant convey the tension portrayed in the film.  While the movie is classified as a psychological thriller, it ultimately becomes more than that, transforming in the last scenes in the film into an apocalyptic tale.

To say more would ruin this film for anyone seeing it.  Suffice it to say its one in which the viewer will think he knows whats going on, but hell really have no clue and will eventually find himself asking, Whats going to happen now?  Is Howard telling the truth? Is he a deluded survivalist?  What really is occurring outside the bunker? Has anything happened at all?  A few shock scenes, one so completely unexpected it will jolt the audience in its suddenness and brevity. Michelle is a truly resourceful heroine instead of the run and scream kind. I don't think it would be a spoiler to say in the last scene, as she literally comes to a crossroads, her character flaw of running away from trouble is put to the test.

To say more would be to ruin this film for any would-be viewer. Ive seen a lot of sci/psychological/thrillers/apocalyptic movies, and I can generally guess how they're going to end, but this one? Didnt expect it at all!

7661314,4,B01BLH8R50,"Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) flees from her fiance. As she is driving at night, another car runs her off the road. She wakes up in a concrete room. She's chained to the wall and has a IV in her arm. She soon finds out she was saved by Howard (John Goodman), who brought her to the bunker and has saved her from certain death. He built this survival shelter under his farm and is waiting for the fallout to dissipate from whatever biological or nuclear attack has happened in the outside world. Michelle only has his word for it. And that of fellow bunkermate Emmet (John Gallagher Jr.). Emmet claims to know Howard, hinting Howard is both a survivalist and a conspiracy theorist. What is Michelle to believe?

The story unwinds in a tense fashion. Howard definitely isn't right in the head but is he the good kind of crazy or the bad kind? Goodman's performance keeps viewers guessing. As a character, Howard clearly sees himself as good but Michelle is unsure. She wants to get out and has more than one riveting escape attempt. More details are revealed about Howard throughout the film, making it a satisfying mystery since most questions are answered by the end. Michelle is a likable and intelligent heroine well played by Winstead.

The movie has a very superficial relationship to Cloverfield. Occasional hints at connections can be caught by astute viewers but they don't amount to much and are only a distraction from this story. Both movies are thrilling but I found this one much more satisfying. The characters here are more interesting and likable than in Cloverfield. The story is more believable and more tense, making it a much better movie.",1474848000,,1663,4.770833333333333

The characters are well cast, and the movie is adept at making you periodically guess who the established protagonist and antagonist really is (Are they evil?  Or good?  Or both?) with no predictable ending, which is difficult to achieve in this day and age.  John Goodman was great to see back on the big screen, and threw in splashes of dark humor that helped provide the movie with some levity.

I won't give away any spoilers, but the last 5 minutes or so of the movie is just a cheap (albeit it expensive) way to throw in a ""twist"" and say that's all folks.

7661532,2,B01BLH8R50,"I was excited to see a newer movie with John Goodman, as he is a good actor. However, this film left a lot to be desired.

7661538,4,B01BLH8R50,"Michelle flees her home in New Orleans after a fight with her boyfriend. Late at night in a rural area, the radio reports about blackouts in major cities. Distracted by that and a call from her boyfriend, she doesn't see the truck that hurtles into her car, leaving her unconscious. She wakes up in an underground bunker in what looks like a jail cell. The man who claims to have saved her is Howard. He also claims that the world is uninhabitable and they can never leave the bunker. She's resistant at first, but then meets another survivor named Emmett. An escape attempt leaves her believing Howard after what she saw through the window, but is Howard really as benevolent as he says?

I didn't enjoy the original Cloverfield because it focused on the most privileged and boring characters who I couldn't bring myself to care about. This film is completely different and solves that problem nicely. The bunker setting is incredibly claustrophobic and the bulk of the film is completely dependent on the performances of the two main characters: Michelle and Howard. Michelle's first urge is to run when something goes wrong whether it's a fight with her boyfriend or an apparent apocalypse. Of course she distrusts Howard as he locked her up in a cell and won't let her near any entrances. She proves to be incredibly resourceful and uses her skills as a designer and a seamstress in ways I didn't expect. Never completely trusting Howard, she tries to utilize safeguards and always looks for ways of escape. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is one of the best final girls in the last few years because she balanced using her skills and being capable with feeling fear and grief.

Howard, on the other hand, is very capable, eerily prepared for such an event, and unstable. He isn't afraid to do what he thinks is for the greater good even if it's incredibly monstrous. He simply won't see it that way. Conflict and tension revolve around him. The first part of the film's suspense is due to if he's telling the truth about the outside world being uninhabitable. When it's revealed he is, that settles down, but his emotional outbursts triggered by just about anything keep that tension going. John Goodman is frightening in this role. He could be fairly even keeled one moment and then lash out the next. The second part of the film is focused on getting to know him more and discovering if the others are in danger by being in such close quarters to him. His action near the end of the film needs to be seen to be believed.

10 Cloverfield Lane is a suspenseful film that has excellent performances and masterfully built suspense. It's clear the Cloverfield stamp was added later since this film has virtually nothing in common with the original movie. This film is unique in that it takes place during an apocalypse situation and then extends past it. What are survivors to do? How will they live in this much different world? Without going into any detail, I loved the ending. It was completely unexpected and well done. The effects looked amazing. I would love to see a sequel.",1472515200,,3076,4.703153988868275
7661539,4,B01BLH8R50,Different and strange movie......I liked it but is was drama. The actress is smokin and John Goodman plays a perfect (SPOILER *****) deranged killer. Not at all about aliens until the last 20 minutes as far as main plot. Glad I watched it.,1472515200,,239,4.5813953488372094

7661548,2,B01BLH8R50,Where do I go from here. The first Cloverfield was annoying to begin with. The jerky hand held POV video camera concept should be put to death. You can never tell what is going on even and never get a good shot of the monster. This version is just plane boring with John Goodman sleepwalking in this. Is he a good guy? Who cares. Once again the action is all saved up for the ending and once again the ending is not worth the wait.,1472515200,2,431,4.08235294117647
7661549,5,B01BLH8R50,"Oh yes, loved this move. And, well, yes, before watching it, I DID make the connection between the 2008 ""Cloverfield"" movie and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". Even so, I was riveted. Is ""Howard"" (John Goodman) an honest samaritan, or an opportunistic sadist in a world gone mad with aliens? You will keep guessing until the end.

Some folks have complained about the ending. But I LOVED It. The ending made perfect sense for Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), while also leaving the door open for more ""cloverfield"". Though, I admit, I found one scene a little bit ""Independence Day"" (1996). Some would say this particular scene was ""unbelievable"". I like to think of it as heroic fantasy. and whats wrong with that? Im not going to spoil it for you. You will know it when you see it. Dare to suspend your disbelief and just go with it.

If you were a fan of ""Cloverfield"" watch this movie. The end of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is just the beginning.

7661617,5,B01BLH8R50,"What is the best Sci-Fi film that is made in 2016?
I wouldn't hestitate a second. 10 CloverField Lane.
Let me rephrase.
What is the best Sci-Fi Thriller top 20 made in 2000s?
Still 10 CloverField Lane at the top of the list no hestitation not even 5 seconds.

Why?

1. The prediction is totally impossible. You won't be able to figure out what's gonna happen next.
2. Gorgeous John Goodman's great Villaine acting and my best best beauty Mary Elizabeth Winstead's graceful look just made me feel good that I am even alive.
3. Great Visual effect and screenplay just made me think that this kind of story can still be exist with limited budget let's say 150,000,000$ the movie can be still better then TITANIC great.
4. This is not a sequal to the previously made <COLVERFIELD>.

You still is not convinced watching this movie?
Help yourself to go to sleep then.

I never thought that the ending will come that much intensive and powerful.
I never thought that John Goodmand will be that much Cameleon look and untill the very end I truely didn't know if he is really a bad guy or really a guy who knows that the alien attacked them and he just wanted to save them that's all.
The story has so many twisted moments and we just coudn't know what is real and what is not untill you know what.

You just might have to think of <MISERY> +any alien attack earth movies <INDEPENDENCE DAY> or something.

But they are all trashy compare to this one.
This one is a masterpiece minimal story dreiven intensive just great film you shouldn't miss.

Also I ask you to watch it with bluray.
It's Dolby Atmost with 7.1 channel even if you don't have that luxury still the sound is great.
And the image is just so so great either.

The guy who made this film is his first feature but feels like his 100th.

It has no flaw at all.

The cinematography-framing.
The acting.
The music-background sound.
The script done by Josh Campbell ,  Matthew Stuecken,  Damien Chazelle  but not himself Dan Trachtenberg which is a bit sad.

Let me tell you a little more about the last scene.

Be careful not to read any reviews that provide too many details.

7661840,3,B01BLH8R50,"I don't know why my expectations were as high as they were. The original Cloverfield isn't exactly a cinematic masterpiece. That said, the film ditches the shaky cam approach in favor of a traditional approach. If youve seen Cloverfield then you know that a creature attacks New York.

That is where all similarities end. The film stops with a young woman in a car accident who then wakes up in a locked basement. Were then introduced to John Goodmans character who is easily the best part of the film. He turns in his very best Kathy Bates performance. Both chilling and clinical in his approach to the man and woman he saved.

SPOILERS.
The last half of the film is where they lost me. The girl kills Goodman, escapes and realizes the air isn't in fact toxic at all but is then attacked by the Cloverfield monsters..wait a minute.a spaceship?
There weren't ANY spaceships in the original. In fact it was implied this was a type of Godzilla monster who was awoken from the bottom of the ocean or something to that effect. Now they're aliens?
Completely and totally lame direction to take the franchise. We did NOT need another alien invasion movie..yawn.

Our heroine who, throughout the whole film is rather sheepish turns into Xena in about five minutes, kills Goodman, all the aliens and manages to take down a spaceship. Oh and she was dropped while in a car about 50 feet and sustains no injuries and walks away.

Five stars for the first half, five stars for Goodman, zero stars for the second part.",1470614400,3,1506,4.629213483146067

7661854,3,B01BLH8R50,"I wanted to be more excited about this movie than I was. Basically, in the beginning we get a lonely man who ""saves"" 2 people from an apparent apocalypse.  Ok, it was slow, but it's clearly building to something and the acting is good.  It's almost like we're watching a play.  Very little special effects, lots of great acting, and few discoveries about who these characters are.  Then about halfway through the tension starts to build at a more rapid pace and we discover who this guy is and a little more about the characters.  Then we are all wrapped up in that story.  Then the John Goodman characters' story is resolved... VERY resolved.  Then with about 15 mins to go we get the set up for the Cloverfield that we saw a few years back, but a really disjointed set up.  This movie was just all over the place.  The shifts in tone and character motives were really jarring and you had to take it with a grain of salt every time the main character acted out of sync with the movie.  About 2/3 of the way through, I just felt like the characters were just a puppets to keep the movie going.  Just a little disappointing.  If the movie had the pace of the last 15 mins of the story, I think I would have been happier with it.",1470441600,,1227,4.264069264069264

This movie is worth watching just for the performances!  John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. each really do a marvelous job.  Very watchable.  Goodman's performance is chilling.

The story is a gripping one that leaves the audience guessing.  Perhaps people are writing poor reviews because they didn't feel like the ending lived up to the rest of the movie.  Truth be told, the (bulk of the) movie is a straight psycho-thriller... the ending is perhaps a bit too much MIB.

But if you can sort of ignore the massive spoiler you already know, and just put yourself in Michelle's mind and think about what would I do in this situation (and to some extent you can also do so for Howard's), then you'll really enjoy this.  If you awoke in a Saw movie like empty, except for the mattress you're on room and your possessions out of reach from you, with a huge creepy steel door, and you realise you're injured and chained to the wall too, what would you think?  When an obese older male stranger tells you, you should be thankful, he saved you and his good grace will only last so long, when you keep acting out against him, what would you think?  He tells you some far fetched story that the world has ended and no one outside the bunker is alive anymore.  His story does seem plausible but you're also thinking you can hear things from above outside the shelter and you'd also be wondering, what's with this empty room then in a bunker where space seems to be fully utilised everywhere else?

I found 10 Cloverfield was a good movie. I did wonder though how Howard got the table, and other large items down into the bunker through the ladder sized entrances.  Now if we could only get movie studios not to spoil movies in their trailers.",1469836800,,1434,4.368421052631579

7661954,4,B01BLH8R50,"What a wide range of opinions we have for this film.  There is a lot to like here.  The action takes place in an underground bunker built and stocked by a survivalist/ prepper played with imposing and measured menace by John Goodman in one of his most challenging and most successful roles ever.  A young woman flees from a fractured marriage for reasons that remain unknown.  She is involved in a traffic accident on a lonely rural road in the middle of the night and wakes up in a survivalists bunker.  Well practiced 32 year old actress Mary Elizabeth Whinstead plays the fleeing wife.
  We watch as the three people, the third person is a young man with a damaged arm, try to co-exist in the cramped quarters.  It gradually becomes clear that the host, Goodman, might be insane.  We don't know if he is simply a maniac or if there really is a catastrophe of some sort going on above ground.  The creepyness and the tension make the film.  It really did scare the pants off of me.
  Goodman is great, Whinstead does well.  Director Dan Trachtenberg commits no professional blunders and the script by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chuzelle keeps us glued to the screen.
  If you are a fan of well crafted scary movies, this one is for you.
  Producer J.J. Abrams allowed his crew a scant but well spent $15 million to make the film.  It returned a spanking $108 million at the box office.  Make a good film and the public will reward you.",1469577600,,1453,4.494252873563219

7662017,5,B01BLH8R50,"For some reason I tend to write reviews comparatively, and that isn't particularly fair. I mean, you don't need to have watched Cloverfield before you watch this movie, and frankly I wouldn't advise you to. In my opinion it sucked.
This movie is a little different from most these days in that the cast consists of maybe like five people you actually see and a couple whose only appearance is voices you hear though various media. From the get-go I was struck by the fantastic cinematography, and the great visual acting [comparison alert] almost like this movie is an apology for Cloverfield. A very good apology.
Another thing I would like to point out is that I remembered everyone's names. That doesn't often happen in movies, but this one did a good job fleshing out the characters enough to make their names sink in.
We are first introduced to Michelle, who had a tiff with her fiance, and is apparently leaving him as a result, or at the least she just needs to drive to get away for awhile. With things packed in her car.
Anyway, she wrecks (in a very painful-looking scene), and wakes up chained to a bed in a room underground. After a few escape attempts, she gradually accepts her captor/rescuer's story: someone attacked the US.
Here we meet Howard and Emmet. Howard seems like a decent fellow who comes unhinged at times, and is very prepared for the coming apocalypse. Emmet seems like a generic funny guy with a bit of a crush on Michelle. All three of them clearly aren't really that comfortable with one another for pretty much the entire film, and this is conveyed very well.
This is very much a look at the different characters, and little tidbits are teased out about each of them both in spoken conversation, and in facial expressions and actions. The acting is very good all around, and I felt that everything tied together very well at the end.
I want to say that I want to see more. There was a good sense of closure about the film, though, and I have come to understand over time that one of the marks of a great story is that it leaves you wanting to find out what happens next; sometimes it is best if you don't actually find out, honestly.",1469318400,,2167,4.516539440203562

7662027,4,B01BLH8R50,"When I watched 10 Cloverfield Lane a few dates ago with my partner, I was expecting a horror-esque thriller with possibly some monster overtones after all, J.J. Abrams, the powerhouse behind the 2013 cult monster hit Cloverfield is one of the producers. What I wasn't expecting was a tale of empowerment, and a subtle exploration of what it means to be saved.

The movie opens with Michelle (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hastily packing belongings while intentionally leaving behind her engagement ring. She frantically drives along increasingly obscure roads, only to black out from an accident and wake up a prisoner, her injured leg chained to a stone wall in a bleak underground room. Michelle is soon introduced to the bunkers owner, Howard (John Goodman), who informs her that there has been an attack. The world outside the bunker has been saturated with poison gas, but he has saved her life. There is no one coming to look for her.

The audience finds themselves identifying with Michelle as she seeks to distinguish real threats in the bunker from those imagined. The films sound design and score are written largely from her perspective and the camera follows her as she makes discoveries about her environment. We quickly discover that although Howard makes himself out to be the good guy, he is clearly one of the monsters of this film. Like many abusers, he casts himself as the heroic savior, even as he gaslights, manipulates, and tries to control everything from Michelles emotions to her very thoughts.

Michelles empowerment is a clear theme throughout this movie as she comes to grips with the reality of Howards predatory nature as well as her own innate ability to resist. This culminates at the end of the film where Michelle is once again in her car, but instead of running from danger, she deliberately turns into its path, willing and able to resist.

In the wake of Michelles empowerment and liberation from her predators, I found myself thinking about what it means to be saved. Howard tells Michelle that he is saving her. And for a short while, Michelle thinks that perhaps he is. But in the end, he is only another predator. Like Michelle, we may find ourselves under the control of something that purports to be saving us when it actually holds us hostage. This can be as insidious as a coping mechanism which turns into an addiction, or a fear-based dogma that imprisons even as it proffers fake feelings of safety. The good news is that we are not powerless against these perpetrators. Instead, somewhere inside us is the ability to conform to an alternative narrative, one that liberates and gives agency to those trapped in darkness.",1469318400,,2675,4.872527472527472

7662029,4,B01BLH8R50,"Wasn't going to buy this one, however i was persuaded by being told i'd enjoy the film....i had no
preconceived notions about the film and had read no write-ups, so knew little or nothing of the
plot, just wanted something different to watch....
'Michelle'(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has had an argument with fiance 'Ben' and decides to leave him
...on her journey away from New Orleans whilst travelling through rural Louisiana  she is distracted by
a bulletin on her car radio and crashes......when she wakes up she finds herself in a concrete room chained
up and on a drip....where was she ?
When the door opens a man she comes to know as 'Howard' (John Goodman) enters the locked room, he
tells her he'd found her upturned car and saved her, he also tells her that they are the only survivors after
a chemical attack, telling her it may have been the 'Russians' or maybe 'Aliens' and it was unsafe to leave.
In recent years he had built a bunker for such events which is where 'Michelle' now finds herself.
She will discover there to be a third person in the bunker 'Emmett' (John Gallagher Jr) who claims to have
witnessed the attack which is why he had made his way to 'Howard's' bunker.
'Howard' has to be in complete control, suffocating control, can what he says be true ?
After uncovering a worrying lie, 'Michelle' knows she must escape the bunker and find out what is really
going on outside.....there are locks/ padlocks on every exit.
Collusion between her and 'Emmett' will be questioned, 'Howard' will pick-up on it.....will 'Michelle' escape
the bunker ?......what has really happened beyond ?
The film does feel a little slow at times, however there is a high level of tension along the way....is 'Howard'
delusional, is he completely mad, or had building the bunker been well conceived plan to protect himself
from such attacks as he'd described....
Must admit, i asked myself these questions along the way unsure of the films outcome.....worth a spin.

Still, it is an entertaining deconstruction of the ""survivalist"" mentality. The heroine is a bit irritating at first but once I bought into the central premise of the story it ended up working for me: basically, the heroine spends the whole movie not listening to men (or at least not taking them seriously). This conceit will probably rub some people the wrong way but I think it illustrated an important notion: is safety and security that valuable that it is worth giving up ones own identity and ability to reason? Do you really want to live in a bunker with a control freak? I guess which side you take will color what you think of the events that unfold in this little tale...",1469232000,2,815,4.476510067114094

I wouldn't mind a whole series of Cloverfield films if they were this well done and were in different genres of thriller or sci-fi. John Goodman is amazing in this piece.

Don't keep reading if you don't want a spoiler I am writing this very limited in spoiler terms. I never saw aliens coming at all. I didn't peg John for an alien guy, but I was surprised that's what it turned into.

7662223,2,B01BLH8R50,"After reading several rave reviews about the film, from folk who did not spoil the experience with too much info, thanks, I decided to give 10 CL a try. I am very happy that I chose to stream a rental version through Amazon instead of purchasing a copy on Blu-ray. The HD presentation was fantastic and the audio was pretty good.
That being said, I will attempt to give my review with the same caution not to spoil the plot for anyone who wants to see 10 CL, as those before me whom I appreciate deeply.
In my opinion 10 Cloverfield Lane was a long, dry, mostly uneventful film, that actually zapped me of my strength. I have to admit that I expected more to be drawn from Goodman, but you can only do so much with the script you are given, and the direction, which made him very predictable. This non-energetic, barely tickling my senses movie further substantiates my opinion that J.J. Abrams is not the great director I first thought him to be. He is only as good as the scripts provided. I found Joel Schumacher's Phone Booth and David Fincher's, Panic Room 10 times more psychologically thrilling than this movie.
The young lady I watched this with fell asleep half way through the movie and I fought hard to get to the end, but then I am overly critical and have watched wayyyyyyy too many films in my lifetime.
This is the best that I can do not to give away any details on the actual film. If you are still interested in seeing 10 Cloverfield Lane I strongly recommend streaming or rental first, just in case you agree with me when it's over.",1468627200,6,1550,4.40418118466899
7662224,5,B01BLH8R50,I really liked it.  I wasn't expecting some of it and the parts that I did expect were handled with acting genius.  I like how they did not milk one of the deaths.

I was happy enough with this movie for the first two thirds of the film or so. I thought the guy (Goodman) was just a bit off his rocker and really thought he was saving people's lives from some disaster that probably didn't exist. I was okay with that. It seemed logical. The main character was a great and expressive actress that had a little fire in her and that was cool. But then all the stuff went down and she realised she could breathe the air that was supposed to be toxic and then aliens showed up and I lost all respect for this film. Blah. Don't spring aliens on us in the last five minutes of the film and then end the movie in such a way that we have no clue what is happening next. I was annoyed.",1468454400,,787,4.077419354838709

It's like the trailer suggests, is it this or that OR BOTH possible storylines. Basically this is a average movie version of an Outer Limits or Twilight Zone episode. Honestly I kept wanting to fast forward/skip ahead to finally get it over with. Very low budget flick with only a few special effects CGI at the ending. This is what turns out to be a suggestive suspense flick about a possible psychopathic maniac and a back drop of a supposed alien invasion, if you're like me you'll figure out the plot about a third of the way through the flick.

It left me scratching my head, and asking myself what just happened.

The scene where the lady from the outside attempted to get in suggests to me that perhaps Howard was telling the truth, but his acting and the story about his daughter gives me suspect. It wasn't until the end did I realize what is the truth and what isn't. I think all the negative review mostly harps on the fact that they EXPECTED a post-apocalyptic movie.

7662557,4,B01BLH8R50,"The premise is fairly simple. A young woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up after a car crash to find herself in a survivalist's underground bunker. She's told by the survivalist (John Goodman) that there's been an apocalyptic event, and everyone outside the bunker is dead. He claims he rescued her. She can stay and he'll take care of her, but she can't leave.  The only other occupant is a handyman who forced his way in before her.

From the very beginning, Winstead is suspicious of Goodman's story. She thinks she's been kidnapped and there's nothing wrong with the world outside. At the same time, she's struggling with the horror of believing the world has come to an end, and how she'll cope living underground. The bunker has all the comforts of home, including food, clothing, games, and books. But what haunts her most is the locked door.

Much of the movie is about going back and forth between her distrust of Goodman and attempts to escape, while attempting to accept the apocalypse as a reality. Every time you start to believe one thing, something happens that shifts you another way. One minute, you believe she's a prisoner, the next you believe she's been saved. One minute, she's playing board games, the next minute she's running for the exit.

The acting is great. The movie is essentially a three-character story, and the three actors play off each other well. John Goodman's performance was especially excellent. He was genuinely creepy and scary, while simultaneously gentle and intelligent. In other words, he struck a perfect balance. Sometimes, he seemed slightly off so you could imagine him as a psychopath holding her captive. Other time, he seemed like a shy and misunderstood hero who saved her life.

In case you're wondering, the answer does come by the end as to whether the apocalypse is real or not. I found it a satisfying twist, but it's worth noting that there was a fair amount of controversy about the title. Fans of ""Cloverfield"" should know this movie really has nothing to do with ""Cloverfield."" They just added the name to boost sales, I think.",1467676800,4,2095,4.840782122905028

The script was lacking, and there were a few times when I was about to fall asleep because they tried to stuff some character development points and it just felt contrived.  There some good turns where it keeps you guessing...but besides that, it was weak.

The special effects were not that great either, felt low budget.  And although I like John Goodman in other roles, i kept asking myself if I thought he was good here or not...and I guess I'm still not sure.  I grew up in the 90's so...reminded me of Rosanne's husband.",1467676800,,587,4.490566037735849

7662563,4,B01BLH8R50,"Can you like a movie and be mad at it at the same time? Sure you can. Let me explain.

Heres what I liked about ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" a thriller starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman:  For about 90 percent of its runtime, its a tight, claustrophobic puzzler. Winsteads car is run off a Louisiana back road, and when she regains consciousness she finds herself imprisoned in an underground bunker with an ominous jailer named Howard (Goodman). Howard informs her that he is actually her savior and that while she was unconscious there was an environmental disaster, possibly nuclear, possibly chemical, or possibly extraterrestrial. Unfortunately, she, Howard, and a third survivor, Howards neighbor, must ride out the catastrophe in the underground shelter, possibly for years.

So far, so good. So far, the movie is like ""Misery"" with this twist: Winstead doesnt trust creepy captor Howard  but theres evidence his story might be true.

Now heres why Im mad: In the films climax, we find out whether or not Howard has been telling the truth. Its a satisfying ending, but  its not the ending. The filmmakers, bless their sequel-loving hearts, choose to extend the ending, expand the story, and turn what had been a taut, adult thriller into something loud, splashy, trailer-friendly  and guaranteed to bring 13-year-olds back to theaters for ""Cloverfield the Sequel.""

There were two or three times in the final minutes when I thought, This is the perfect ending, or Now would be a great time to roll the credits. But no, audiences expect overkill these days, apparently, so we must have two or three endings. Why settle for delicious ambiguity when you can spell things out in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS and show off your special effects?

Its too bad, because what comes before the overblown denouement is some nail-biting suspense, some smart writing, and two solid performances by Goodman and Winstead.  Grade: B+ --grouchyeditor.com",1467676800,,1943,5.081761006289308
7662564,2,B01BLH8R50,"This is a movie that tries to be two things at once and doesnt do both particularly well.  It starts out as a strange dramatic thriller then veers off to a Sci-fi movie into the last 15 minutes or so.  It just doesnt mesh the two genres particularly well, in a particularly choppy not well told story.  The characters are not too deeply explored and the dialogue for the most part is boring and odd.  I will give Goodman credit as he does play the oddball survival character well but the remaining cast (and there are really only 3) seem one dimensional and flat.  There are some moments of tension and action like a good thriller has but there is also a lot of monotonous meaningless dialogue and scenes in between as well.  I really have no problem with the whole sci-fi aspect of the movie but to be stopped by one small Molotov cocktail made from a bottle of alcohol seemed a bit anti-climactic.  This movie seems to borrow from the pages of the Twilight Zone episodes with its kind of weird vibe but the movie as a whole doesnt seem to mesh those ideas together too well.  The movie is an ok time waster and if you are a Goodman fan it is worth watching just for his oddball performance, but don't expect this thriller to have as much suspense as it really needs with a subpar script.  There are better thriller and better sci-fi movies than this one.

Later, Michelle starts to get suspicious as she witnesses several questionable behavioral actions coming from Howard and starts questioning if Howard is really helping her or holding her captive. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie that exceeded my expectations going into it as I didn't know much going into it. This is one of the most unsettling suspenseful thrillers that has ever come out in quite a while. The movie offers plenty of edge of-your-seat suspense that gets you thinking what will happen next and offers good character development and performances from the cast.

7662626,2,B01BLH8R50,"A disappointingly threadbare plot that could have been lifted straight from the Tom Cruise re-make of War of the Worlds. The similarities are too striking to be merely coincidental. The earth's population has been decimated by alien invaders, while an insane survivalist called Howard (John Goodman) hides in an underground bunker and attempts to keep others captive there - ostensibly for their own safety. As in War of the Worlds, the heroine, Michelle, (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) must kill the survivalist in order to escape. Later, she is attacked by one of the alien creatures and destroys it by throwing an explosive device into its ""mouth"" before it can consume her.

We are told nothing of the alien's origins or purpose (the audience is left to suppose the plan is the standard fare of world domination and exploitation of resources) and only given the merest glimpses of them right at the end of the film.  We have to wait a long time (almost 1 and a half hours) for those glimpses too and one is forced to wonder whether they were really necessary at all.  The film would have worked just as well as an intense, psychological thriller without them but with just enough of a hint of Armageddon (a few burned-out cars, smoke on the horizon etc) to indicate to the escaped Michelle that Howard had been telling the truth all along.  After listening to a call for volunteers on a car radio, off she goes to join the resistance and we are left to wait for 10 Cloverfield Lane 2.",1467504000,,1483,4.670498084291188

7662637,2,B01BLH8R50,"Someone saw The Divide and decided to write their own PG-13 version of it.

Then JJ Abrams got a hold of the script and wanted to turn it into an alien movie by, you guessed it, adding aliens into the last 15 minutes.

Originally, the script was nearly beat-for-beat The Divide and had a totally different ending devoid of anything sci-fi/inhuman.

This could have been a way better/surprising movie had the studio not been stupid enough to title it CLOVERFIELD. There ya go. You gave away the twist right in the title. From the get-go, you know something alien will occur so you're just waiting for it the whole movie. There's no guessing as to whether or not John Goodman's character is telling the truth or crazy BECAUSE THE TITLE GIVES IT AWAY. Had this been called by its original script title, such a War of the Worlds ending would've been cool.

The movie is well done for what it is and John Goodman nails it, but seriously people, had the title not been changed and in the process--ruin the whole reveal of the flick--it would have still just been a near-plagiarism of The Divide (except without audacity, the incredible original score and gut-punching ending).",1467417600,,1170,4.692682926829268

7662641,3,B01BLH8R50,"This is one movie that I went into with mixed feelings and came out the same way. Unlike most others I really, really detested the movie ""Cloverfield."" I can't stand the cheap, home movie camera cinematography of movies because it would require that there be a narcissistic jerk to film events in a catastrophe rather than put the camera down and help out. And, the film quality becomes garbage with the requisite hand held camera jerky movements. Because of the title I mistakenly believed that this movie was a sequel to ""Cloverfield."" What I watched had nothing to do with the first movie and did not appear to be a sequel. No giant dinosaur attacking a large metropolitan city. In fact, no dinosaur at all.

I read the reviews and saw the movie trailer and decided to buy the Blu Ray and give this new movie a chance. I even started to forget about ""Cloverfield"" (no hand held camera BS and no dinosaurs) as the movie commenced. As was already mentioned, the heroine is involved in an accident on a country road and wakes up in an underground bunker. The movie goes on to become a psychological drama which draws the audience into guessing is Howard the insane, conspiracy theory nut and Emmett just a nave, innocent young man. Or, is Howard a paranoid genius and Emmett  going along for his own reasons?  I admit that I was going over both scenarios in my mind. Especially with the plot twists that take place. This was really excellent story twisting.

I would have easily rated this a 5 star movie. Except, for the anti-climactic ending that ruined everything. No, no dinosaurs. No, no connection with ""Cloverfield,"" the movie (thank god for that, at least!). I won't reveal the ending for those that haven't seen this movie yet. But, they could have edited out the last 5-10 minutes of the movie and ended it cleanly without the totally unnecessary story twist. If they had done that it would have been an exceptional movie.

7662698,4,B01BLH8R50,"Given that I was a fan of the original Cloverfield movie, as soon as I heard that they were making something related to the project, I wanted to see it.  I didn't get a chance to see the film in theaters, unfortunately, but I did just watch it after renting it.  And I must say that it didn't disappoint me, while it's very little like the original Cloverfield movie, it still possesses an air to it that is similar.  Something is going on and it's not entirely explained, the ending is vague in what's happened and is happening, and we're only given a few sparse clues about it.  We only know as much as the main character, Michelle, knows.  Which, naturally, isn't very much.

However, the bulk of the movie doesn't focus on what's going on in the world, or the overall situation at hand.  Rather, we see it focus on Michelle's predicament as she's kept in an underground bunker at the mercy of a man, Howard who is played by John Goodman, that she has difficultly trusting due to his rather precarious mentality.  The plot of the story uses this as its focal point, and shows how Michelle copes and plots to be free.

Overall, I'd recommend this movie.  Is it perfection?  No, but I still give it 4 out of 5 stars.  It has some flaws and if you're not expecting the way the film ends and the sudden inclusion of some of the elements there, it can definitely throw you off.  The movie might have benefited from focusing more on only the struggle Michelle faces in the bunker and ended there, but the way the movie is left off we do get a couple of answers, and we're left with something of a cliffhanger that could lead us into seeing a sequel to this movie, or, at least, another movie set in the Cloververse.",1467158400,,1712,4.3627760252365935

It starts out with an interesting plot--I figured it was a thriller, the guy is a psycho/rapist/whatever convincing her the world came to an end to keep her underground. That would have been more believable than what the actual ending was. I read several reviews and that was the #1 complaint--the ending sucked.

7662742,3,B01BLH8R50,"I had fairly high hopes for this movie, and was a bit let down. FYI, I always start with an open mind, and a 5 star score, and decrease it based on the viewing.

The Good - The actors all did a great job. This is why they are A-listers. They play their roles perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Michelle, a woman who consistently seems to run from any threat in her life. During the course of the movie, we are introduced to a number of times that she has done this. The opening of the film shows her running away from her significant other, following an apparent fight they'd had. She gets into a car accident, and awakens in an underground prepper bunker that was built by John Goodman's character, Howard. Goodman plays his role with nothing less than perfection. She thinks that she's been kidnapped, but finds that she and Goodman are not the only people in the bunker, and that a young man played by John Gallagher, Jr. is also there, but by his own choice. Howard and Emmett tell her that there's been some kind of an attack, possibly chemical or nuclear. While she was preparing to leave her home, she was listening to the news, where she heard that there was something going on that had caused the east coast to be in blackout, and that there was no communications to the coast.

The Bad - I found myself questioning many things about the environment that Howard had created, and the realism, or lack of realism with respect to the bunker. There were a few times that references were made to facilities that were in use, but were glossed over, or skipped altogether, making me question that this bunker would actually be feasible at all. Additional reasons for the loss of 2 stars are below in the spoilers section.

****  Spoilers Below  ****

In the film, the two 'guests' of Howards decide that they need to leave, but due to contamination from the attack, that they need to make a gas mask and protective suit. Eventually, they are found out, because Howard enters Michelle's room and sees the edge of the fabric sticking out from under her bed. This simply made me shake my head. If she was so afraid of Howard, and wanted to make sure she wouldn't get caught, she would simply have worked on it while he was asleep. That would give you a number of uninterrupted hours, rather than trying to work on it non-stop, hoping not to get caught.

The other thing that didn't sit well with me was the 'Cloverfield' name. I expected this to be directly linked to the film Cloverfield, and other than the east coast blackout and attack, there doesn't seem to be any other link. The attack seems to be from extraterrestrials, not the strange animals that were seen in Cloverfield. I think that they should have either made the name completely different, or include some of the same creatures that were seen in Cloverfield.",1467072000,,2830,4.537254901960784

7662896,4,B01BLH8R50,"10 Cloverfield Lane was the beneficiary of one of the smartest marketing campaigns ever devised. Was this a sequel to the 2008 film Cloverfield about a giant monster running amuck in New York or was this a psychological horror about crippling paranoia of the unknown? The fact is that the movie works well on many different levels and with a box office gross of $108 million on a budget of just $15 million, the film outperformed many of the other blockbusters in the first half of 2016.clover blue

Michelle (Winstead) is driving through rural Louisiana when she is in a terrible accident leaving her unconscious on the side of the road. She wakes in the underground survival bunker of Howard Stambler (Goodman) who explains that he found her on the road and brought her to his bunker for safety as the world as suffered an apocalyptic event, making it no longer safe to go outside. Inside the bunker she meets Emmett, a local neighbor of Howards who fled to the bunker for safety.

Initially Michelle is skeptical about Howards tale and attempts to escape but upon seeing a woman desperately trying to get inside she realizes that something has happened to the outside world. Soon the three resign themselves to life in the bunker. As Michelle and Emmett tiptoe around the paranoid Howard and his many and often odd rules, they soon discover that his story, particularly about his daughter doesnt add up. The pair hatches a scheme, making a homemade hazmat suits, and plan their escape.

Had 10 Cloverfield Lane simply been a psychological thriller about how paranoia can drive you to lose all reason, it would have been a great film. But the films devilishly clever tie-in to Cloverfield is what puts the cherry on top of this sundae. One can only imagine the terror in Michelle when she thinks shes finally reached some semblance of safety when escaping the bunker, only to find that shes gone from the frying pan into the fire. And you don't even mind that the film shamelessly sets up another sequel. Heck! I cant wait!

Goodman, best known for his comedic roles, doesnt get enough credit for his dramatic performances. The film revolves around his character, Howard. Michelle and Emmett are in the bunker because of Howard. They are safe because of him but also are kept there because of him. Howard relates only enough information to stir their curiosities. He can go from loving father figure in one moment to unhinged lunatic in the next. The tension builds to a slow burn as they soon realize that what is waiting for them on the outside may not be as terrifying as what is on the inside.

10 Cloverfield Lane was produced by J. J. Abrams who refers to the film as a blood relative and spiritual successor to 2008s Cloverfield. But the two films are completely different in their tone and scope. While Cloverfield was told in first person perspective in the expanse of New York City, this film is positively claustrophobic yet both films strike equal yet different types of hear and tension.

Blu-ray Extras

Audio Commentary with J. J. Abrams and Director Dan Tractenberg. One of the better commentary tracks I have heard recently. Goes into a lot of the mystery of the film and the ties to Cloverfield.

Featurettes  There are seven short featurettes which combine for just over 30 minutes. Hardly a comprehensive set which is disappointing.

7662901,4,B01BLH8R50,"Over-all this is pretty great thriller. John Goodman plays an excellent creepy guy. Mary Elisabeth Winstead was an awesomely clever surprise. In most thrillers/scary movies, the female characters are rarely believable or relatable from a real-world perspective. We usually find ourselves frustrated or irritated with the lack of intelligence or overall panic-stricken inability to save herself/anyone from whatever scary subject the story is about. This is not ""that"" kind of movie.
The audience can easily be carried by ""Michelle's"" quick thinking, continuous observation of her soundings and puzzle solving skill.
If you are looking for a thrilling movie that breaks the mold of the ""normal"" helpless female, this is most certainly worth watching.",1466899200,2,749,5.6371681415929205

The film is tightly constructed and well paced, faltering only at the very end with a coda that doesn't quite work.

I like the main actors-John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead and the general survivalist theme. The main trailer scene ""Don't Open That Door!!"")is the catch phrase and you go along trying to figure out if this is a abduction or actual survival story,I don't want to give that away. There's enough suspense during the movie to keep it interesting. I like the ""bunkers"" decor as it reminds me of a cozy cabin in the woods and wouldn't mind hanging out there myself!!  This was well acted and interesting for 90 minutes or how long it was!,check it out!! I'm not sure of the other Cloverfield movie series as I haven't seen them in years,but I liked the survivalist theme and the two main actors. Hope you enjoy!!!",1466726400,,866,4.660130718954249

About four-fifths of it is a very slow-boil and very standard hostages-in-the-basement movie, the supposedly thrilling aspects of which all revolve around what the viewer thinks about Goodman's character. When he finally reveals that character, things get briefly more lively but hardly surprising. The last one-fifth of the running time is like a bad music video stuck onto the end. It's also not exactly surprising, since what happens is given away in the title. They're like two separate movies, one too long and one way too short, scotch-taped together on the thinnest of pretexts. The writing throughout is lax, muddy and sloppy, and logical inconsistencies abound. Goodman's okay in his role, but really he's no more menacing than he was as Big Dan Teague in O Brother. The two young people stuck with him are empty ciphers who never develop real characters despite sitting around moodily talking about themselves. It's got a few moments, but it's just not very good at any of the things it tries to do. There are much better scary-killer movies, much better hostage movies, much better alien invasion movies (like Cloverfield), Why the critics, who presumably have seen some of those films, were so kind to this one is the biggest surprise and scariest mystery of them all.",1466640000,,1343,5.0

7663172,5,B01BLH8R50,"The original Cloverfield was a great movie, in my opinion, but its unorthodox, shaky camera-work and extremely open-ended plot left a lot of people leaving the theater either disappointed or sick to their stomachs (or both). Despite my love for the film, it's very much a hit-or-miss with most people. It's become a ""cult classic"" of sorts (though I'm uncomfortable calling it a true cult classic until it's aged a few more years. Another decade or so, maybe...)

But this isn't Cloverfield! Not the first one, anyway. 10 Cloverfield Lane's directing and camera-work is much more steady and deliberate here (not that the original wasn't deliberate in what it accomplished, too). The characters are much more complex and deep, as well, because the plot is completely molded and propelled forward by their thoughts, fears, wants, and needs. Unlike the original, which showed a group of ordinary people being thrown into a catastrophic event much bigger than themselves and moving through New York under the constant threat of death, the characters of 10 Cloverfield Lane would be stuck together for a long time, relatively safe from danger. Instead of a giant monster, their greatest conflict would be learning how to live with each other. However, the biggest disconnect from the original film is that 10 Cloverfield Lane IS NOT a direct sequel! 10 Cloverfield Lane has officially cemented this as an anthology series. (As of right now, J.J. Abrams claims that these films do not share the same universe or timeline, but his pitch for a potential third film, as well as certain parallels between both films, suggest that this may be a ruse. Only time will tell...)

For those of you who disliked the first film, I'm sure that you're more intrigued now, to which I would like to say: thanks for stickin' out the rest of this review. For those of you jumpin' outta your pants in anticipation of seeing Clover again: PLEASE, DON'T TOUCH THAT ""BACK"" BUTTON!!! Just give me a minute to let me tell you what a die-hard fan thinks of this new direction before you make your final judgment.

10 Cloverfield Lane is very different from the original, it's true, but it's also a lot more similar than you may think. The film originated as a low-budget script called ""The Cellar"". As the final draft of the script was being written, Abrams noticed that the tone of the film--the setting, humor, horror, etc.--fit nicely with the themes of the first film. Abrams had found the answer to his Cloverfield 2 dilemma! I went into this movie expecting to see the return of Clover, the monster, and when the credits began to roll and she was nowhere to be found, I thought that I would be disappointed... but I wasn't. I was satisfied. More than satisfied. I was ecstatic! The story was different, more isolated and compact, but the SOUL was familiar. While I love the original's plot, too, I realized that the soul was what I was most in love with. As an artistic individual, I highly value new and fresh ideas, so even though I was expecting a continuation of the first, what I got surprised me--not just in its quality and psychological depth, but in that it gave me exactly what I wanted out of the experience without me realizing it until well after the screen had faded to black!

I'm sure many people, especially fans of the original, were disappointed to hear about such a major departure in style, but I implore you to give this film a chance! The differences it has are actually its strengths! Having steady, solid camera-work helps us to focus on subtle story cues through expressions on characters' faces. Every shot and scene not only move the story forward significantly, but they also visually establish random objects or details that the viewer may naturally gloss over until they become central to the plot. The focus on character psychology and the tight, contained nature of the story that only affects these three characters makes the atmosphere deliciously tense and scary, demonstrating that taking shelter from an outside threat may not always be the safest course of action. It plays with Michelle, the main character, as well as the audience by deliberately revealing new information in bits over the course of the film that ask two very big questions: ""Did something really happen outside the bunker?"" and ""Did Howard, the man who shelters Michelle and Emmett, really save them?"" All of these twists and turns, which are smartly written and beautifully executed, make this film worthy of holding the Cloverfield name, and sets the stage for a potential anthology series--something that I haven't seen done very often with movies.

The actors in this film KILL IT, too. Each one of these guys fill their roles dynamically: Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the anxious, scared, yet instinctively strong young woman; Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the sweet, funny, yet socially awkward small-town man who just wants to make the best of the end of the world, and Howard (John Goodman), the single-minded survivalist who can be quite endearing, but become menacing and authoritative just as fast. All of them are great, especially Goodman. While Winstead and Gallagher's characters have consistency, Goodman is tasked with playing an emotionally unstable character that can be subtly creepy, endearing, or fly off the handle at the tiniest thing. His acting is truly something special to behold, and all of them do a fantastic job at embodying whatever the tone of the film calls for at any given time.

I wish that my review didn't turn out as convoluted as it is, but hopefully it made some sense and convinced at least some skeptics that it's worth picking up. Buying the Blu-ray version is always best in my book as well, because it comes with three different formats in one package, as well as more special features. I wish that the special features lasted longer than 30 minutes, but it's common for special features to only last a total of 30-60 minutes, I suppose... Anyway, I definitely recommend picking up this gem of a film!",1466553600,13,6039,4.86964980544747

Suspense/thriller turned into Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. Really? This was as good as they could come up with? For a JJ Abrams production, I was disappointed. Certainly the writers and producers could have come up with something more believable and... scary! I honestly laughed.

There are no hidden clues built in through the first part of the film, the shocks are less shocking the second time around and while the performances are very good across the board, you don't get anything more out of it.

I loved it!  In many ways 10 Cloverfield Lane is better than the original Cloverfield because the acting is superb.  Most characters in the original were annoying--especially Hud--and while John Gallagher, Jr's character Emmett DeWitt can at times have some Hud characteristics (i.e. talking too much) it's not so bad that it becomes annoying, but rather ""you better watch out dude, you're gonna piss off John Goodman.""  I kept reading that this is only a ""spiritual successor"" to the original Cloverfield so I was worried the antagonist in this film and the alleged ""apocalypse"" would be stupid, but I was pleasantly surprised.

One night a woman has left her boyfriend/husband and is run off the road by someone. She wakes up in the shelter and is a prisoner of the demented Goodman. He tells her that there has been an attack either by our enemies or aliens. She, of course thinks he's crazy, but as the movie progresses she comes to believe he might not be so crazy.

7663323,5,B01BLH8R50,"I am shocked to read all of the poor reviews for this film.  I feel like people had certain expectations and were too confused when they realized it wasn't what they thought it was going to be.  So, before watching this film please know that it is not related to the 2008 ""Cloverfield"" in any way - it is not an action packed monster/alien invasion movie.  This movie is exactly as it is labeled, a Mystery/Suspense film where you're not sure what is really happening.  It is a unique cocktail of survival, paranoia, and the unknown.  The plot can be slow, but that's what makes these suspense movies great.  You need to take the time to build up anticipation.  I'd also like to note that there are no questions left unanswered in this film.  Some reviewers said they didn't understand why some parts of the film were included and all I can say to that is those people were obviously not paying attention.  Every scene fits into the movie as a whole.

I think what I loved most about this movie is how unexpected it was.  It gets old watching the same plots over and over and this film stayed fresh until the credits rolled.  Every time I thought this movie was headed in a certain direction it would take an abrupt turn into something else.  There are multiple themes going on in this film at once which I can't elaborate on without giving the movie away.  Let's just say the main character is having the worst luck and is finding herself stuck in two separate situations throughout the movie that are both very bad and also rare to be in.  I personally found the last 10 minutes of this movie somewhat humorous.  When you're having multiple bad things happen to you sometimes all you can do is shake your head and laugh.  Watching the main character swearing ""wtf"" outloud to herself pretty much summed that up for me.",1466294400,7,1820,4.4832826747720365
7663324,5,B01BLH8R50,"To all reading, this is both a clarification on the ending, as well as a review.

10 Cloverfield Lane is the secret non-blockbuster hit that was a blockbuster, produced by J.J. Abrams and the directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. Without spoiling any of the details of the story, it follows three characters (Howard, Michelle and Emmett), with Michelle having been brought to an underground bunker by Howard, who tells her that the world is gone, and that the bunker is the only safe haven from the outside.
I'm getting this out of the way now. People talked crap about the film because of the ending and how it ""seemed"" completely different from the rest of the movie, but it wasn't. This is, quite literally, a perfect movie. There isn't a single plot hole, and there isn't a single moment that doesn't work, especially the ending. Disclaimer to all reading, SPOILERS AHEAD!

Howard, who we learn over the course of his ramblings and the movie, was a former Navy specialist who worked specifically on satellites. During his time in service, before his discharge, he had said he came across extra-terrestrial signals being bounced off our satellites, but he couldn't track them. Then, building his bunker, he had the CB radio tuned into other military frequencies, of which talked about a possible attack, but the details were fuzzy because no nation was ever named, which further strengthened his seemingly absurd Martian theory. Now, he most likely wasn't completely deranged, but most likely suffered his mental break when his wife left him for not believing and took his daughter. That is what created the monster we meet, coupled with the fact that he was right about an attack; he wanted a daughter, and was going to do whatever he could to have her back, in whatever way (creepy as hell, right!). So, even though he was right, his collapse already happened. I can understand if people didn't find it to be satisfactory the first time around, because without paying attention to all details it didn't seem to track, but it does, which makes it all the more terrifying. Now, onto my review...

The direction was phenomenal. For Trachtenberg's first film, this felt like Best Picture material throughout. The claustrophobia, the tension building, the emotional character build and true horror were all there when they needed to be, and there wasn't a single moment to take a breather. Now, this of course wouldn't be possible without the writers, who fleshed out all plot holes and built all the characters to their highest points, while making the world around very real and tangible. In the opening 5 minutes, an object appears that would be used in the climax of the film, which blows anyone's theory of it being a Deux ex machina out of the water. Also, it helped that the writers only had three characters to truly worry about and build, while making sure everything else was in place. The acting, though. The acting. If Goodman doesn't get a boatload of awards, I don't know why they exist. Then, Elizabeth Winstead blew it out of the park as Michelle, and even Gallagher, Jr. as Emmett, offering more humanity and heart where it's needed most. Even Bear McCreary's musical score (who's known for his work on Battlestar Galactica, Eureka and Europa Report) was incredibly haunting and gut-wrenching in that it helped supercharge whatever scenes his music was used in.

If anyone has questions, please ask, but please be respectful too. I know the movie isn't for everyone and I know there are still people who don't care for this type of movie, but if you're a film nut like myself, the filmmaking behind this was spot on, especially with how the movie almost literally came out of nowhere. But, everyone should watch it just for the experience; it was a truly terrifying ride.",1466294400,3,3789,4.842592592592593

Good acting, very good. However, as a Cloverfield fan, this was disappointing. Don't expect any kind of connection to the first movie, because there isn't one-except that there is an Alien attack. What made me HAVE to see this movie was the trailer-which, in my opinion, is one of the best trailers ever made. I HAD to see what she was looking at once she escaped to the door and looked out the window. Well, I saw the movie and was not impressed with what it turned out to be. The ending was a bit too fantastical for me-the girl becomes a combination of McGuyver, Sarah Connor and then John Conner all in one. And don't get me started on her surviving a six-story vertical car freefall! The trailer pretty much sums up the entire movie and the ending is straight out of Terminator, John Connor style. A little too obvious with the mix of storyline cliche's. Also, there were some loose ends that won't ever be resolved for the viewer, which is quite maddening.",1466208000,,1023,4.535135135135135

SPOILER ALERT: STOP READING IF YOU DON""T WANT TO KNOW DETAILS....

ok, one of the main problems with this movie, for me, is that the stupid people survive and the only really good one does not. By the end my only hope that the movie might redeem itself is if the stupid girl would drop dead, preferably eaten by whatever was lurking outside (and it was NOT nice). In a nutshell the plot goes like this: crazy survivalist rescues and traps a girl in a shelter telling her she will die if she goes outside. The plot provdes us and her with plenty of evidence she should not go out. Her actions and the actions of the third character in the movie lead Howard (the survivalist) to kill the young man, in what can be considered self preservation. The girl kills Howard, escapes and is plunged into a world exactly like Howard told her, with huge, horrible aliens.  Moral of the story: she is an idiot, Howard was right. Yet the movie strives to make you sympathize with her.

Sorry, stupid plot, and after all that I did not even get the pleasure of seeing her being eaten by the aliens? waste of money :-)",1466208000,8,1283,4.3112033195020745

The mysteries that were starting to make us question were tossed aside for, wait for it, an alien invasion.

So I'm a huge fan of scary movies, but I've noticed lately that most of them lack whatever it is that makes them both memorable and, well, scary. When I saw the trailer for this, I was mildly interested and my boyfriend, a huge fan of the spooky movies too, was chomping at the bit. This was one of the most suspenseful movies I've watched in recent memory. The way you question what the truth is until almost the very end makes you so engaged in the movie that when I bought the digital copy on Amazon I rushed to have a movie night with my friends. We're all pretty easily distracted as a group, but after the first few minutes, cell phones were put away and everyone was watching with rapt attention, making suppositions as to the ending and who was the real bad guy.
The main characters proactive involvement in her own plot was truly unique. An unfortunate trope of horror movies is that the main character, most often a girl, is basically useless while the secondary character(s), most often the guy who is sexually interested in her, runs around and saves the day. In this case, our female protag knows what she wants and how to get it and will do whatever it takes to claim her freedom. She responds in the way that we all would hope to respond in such a situation, which makes the movie  imminently watchable.",1466121600,8,1337,4.434959349593496

This film takes some old but good plot ideas and gives them the necessary twists and details that make it a smart, riveting drama.  Do you call it a drama? A scary movie? A movie that makes you guess at what could happen next?  It's kind of all of those.  It's not boring or tedious, and I found the pace of it as well as the GREAT actors involved to be a good recipe for an intense, apprehension filled film.  I was glad to see even the ending was, in this viewers opinion, very well done.  Sometimes a film like this can fail with the ending but, the writer, director and producer must have a great team to create something as good as this.  This film isn't what you think it is, if that makes sense.  There isn't a wasted scene in this thing.

7663482,2,B01BLH8R50,"I'm very disappointed as I was expecting something amazing from JJ and this wasn't it. I didn't know anything about the film beforehand other than there was a twist. Well, there wasn't a twist. Its in the freaking title! Of course there was aliens. I suspected this from the beginning and no surprise there.

So, basically, everything is exactly the way things appear within the first few minutes of the film. Yep, he's a creep. Yes, she's a hostage. Yep, people will die. Yes, its Aliens. Oh and its not even a cool ending. She beats the Aliens of course and drives away. Oh don't worry, you'll never see what cool stuff would've happened after that... not even in a future sequel (because it'll never happen)..

It really doesn't make much sense either. So, that chick at the door suffered burns of some sort? What was the explanation for that? Are we not supposed to remember that? I mean, hey, our lead actress got a whole Alien Army after her (did I count 2 gigantic spaceships or was that 3) since apparently they have the resources to do this to for each of the billions of people on the planet. Oh, except for that chick-at-the-door. She just gets a burn treatment and somehow wants to hang out desperately in a bunker as opposed to heading in the city like everyone else wants to. She had a car, but hey, just stop and bang on the door instead.

I don't understand who wanted to see this. Were there people who were like ""lets watch a film about a crazy guy who takes a woman hostage""? I mean, really? I think people were just excited because of the ""twist"" but its not much of a twist.

I was really wanting a film like Cabin in the Woods that blows your mind. Heck, even the Saw films at least have something special about them. Sure, the acting is great, but man... no thank you.",1466035200,,1791,4.401812688821752

Instead, this movie is a thriller and psychological drama where you are (to an extent) kept guessing about what has actually happened ""outside"" and what the motivation of John Goodman's character might be.

Spoilers

Our heroine leaves her apartment after an implied fight with her fiance.  The radio indicates some sort of power blackout in parts of the country.  Cue the car crash, and our heroine finds herself banged up, somewhat patched up, and chained to the wall of a bunker. She of course expects the worst, but the...host...tells her that some sort of attack has occurred and it is not safe to leave.  His story is partly confirmed by another local that took refuge in the bunker.

As the story progresses, it does seem there may be monsters outside...but it is much more likely that a human type monster is in the bunker.",1465948800,,954,4.815950920245399

The movie was plausible for 90 percent of the way through. It dealt with an unstable psychotic kidnapper and a women who struggled to find out the truth of why she was captured in the first place. The writers had a very plausible tale going and a suspense one at that, but then ruined it by hitting a foul ball in the science fiction realm on the last fifteen minutes of the film. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, let me just say this - the unplausible twist at the end didn't work too well for me in a story that maintained plausibility during most of the films duration. They should have kept it plausible right up to the ending credits.

Please see it, if you haven't already! In my personal opinion, it is the best film of 2016! I sure hope that a sequel to this film comes soon! p.s.

When she wakes up she is chained to a bed in a tiny room with no idea where she is. After Howard (Goodman) explains he is trying to save her from the devastation of the outside world she isn't sure what to believe. Now Michelle and fellow captive Emmett must decide if risking the possibly dangerous outside world is safer than staying with Howard. I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I did not like the original movie at all and was expecting more of the same. I couldn't not have been more wrong. This movie takes place after the attacks of the first movie, but the style is totally different. First (and best) the movie is not a found-footage type thing. That is a huge plus. This is tremendously entertaining, keeps you guessing the entire time and is tense without trying to be. If you are avoiding watching this because of the original don't worry. This is much much better. When it ended I was actually hoping it would keep going. This is one of, if not the biggest surprise movies of the year for me. I highly recommend this.

7663627,5,B01BLH8R50,"Movies set mostly in a single location, like 10 Cloverfield Lane,"" can be risky. Visual fatigue can easily set in if the story isn't strong, engaging and suspenseful. Happily, 10 Cloverfield Lane neednt worry. Its a grim but completely absorbing story of survival with a significant element of mystery and menace.

Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), fleeing a bad relationship with her boyfriend, is driving late at night and gets into a terrible accident. The next thing she knows, she is lying on a mattress in a bare, concrete cell, with an intravenous tube in her arm and her wrist handcuffed to the wall. Soon, the rooms heavy metal door is opened by a large, imposing man (John Goodman)  we later learn his name is Howard  who says he found her wrecked car at the side of the road and brought her here.

Michelle is unnerved by his appearance and especially by what he tells her: there has been some kind of invasion  maybe by the Russians, or the Chinese, or the Martians  who poisoned the outside air. She is in a bunker he constructed years ago. They will need to stay there for one, maybe two years until the air clears.

Is Howard telling the truth, or is he a crazed abductor who fashioned the story to calm Michelle and dissuade her from trying to escape? Turns out theres another occupant of Howards bunker  Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.)  who explains hes not a prisoner; hes staying in the bunker willingly until its safe to emerge. Now Michelle is thoroughly confused.

Howards bunker is a veritable underground apartment, complete with comfortable furniture, games and puzzles to pass the time, a well-stocked jukebox, and plenty of provisions. Eventually, Michelle settles into this new reality, sharing meals with her co-occupants and grateful to Howard for saving her.

The 2008 film Cloverfield, was about an alien invasion. Shot in the found-footage style, its events unfolded ostensibly through annoyingly shaky home video cameras that happened to capture the chaos. 10 Cloverfield Lane, despite its title, isn't a sequel but can be considered a first cousin to the earlier film, mostly because both use apocalypse as the key plot point. Fortunately, the new films cinematography is traditionally steady. The only glimpse we get of the outside is through a small window in a door. It faces a wheat field, with nothing else in sight until a shocking appearance on the other side of that window creates more questions and deepens the mystery.

Essentially a three-character drama, this film could have been a stage play, especially since the two leads are so well defined. Goodman is terrifying as Howard, and suspenseful since we never really know if hes truthful about poisoned air, mass invasion, and the necessity of remaining in the bunker, possibly for years. This is what drives the movie. At times, were convinced that  though he may be weird  hes a survivalist who really prepared for doomsday. At other times, he gives off an uncomfortable vibe as he insists that his two guests follow his rules without question. If you know Goodman mostly from his role on TVs Roseanne, you will be surprised at how different his Howard is from that character.

Ms. Winsteads Michelle is not your typical helpless movie female. Though initially terrified, she acclimates herself to an awful but necessary circumstance, yet periodically questions, wondering about inconsistencies in Howards story, finding unsettling clues in the bunker, and learning details about Howard by talking with Emmett. Later, she turns out to be resourceful, using her knowledge of the bunkers layout to ferret out the truth.

Rated PG-13, 10 Cloverfield Lane deals with societys demise without the elaborate CGI effects so common in end-of-the-world action pictures. This is an intense drama that benefits from two excellent performances.

Bonus extras on the 2-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack release include commentary by director Dan Trachtenberg and producer J.J. Abrams and over 30 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage. A digital HD copy is included.",1465603200,,4044,5.057142857142857
7663628,5,B01BLH8R50,"Although 10 Cloverfield Lane is branded a ""Cloverfield"" movie, the tie-ins are loose enough to require no previous viewings of the alien kaiju city-stomper flick. This is a completely stand-alone film - different plot, different characters, and a radical ending that makes me think the Cloverfield brand will allow future creators to put their own particular spin on the creature-feature. When and if there are any other new Cloverfield movies, I suspect we'll be able to view this series as a sort-of anthology of feature-length movies with a common theme, rather than direct sequels. There's a lot of Twilight Zone inspiration happening in this one, and it's a terrific amount of fun.

Here, we find Mary Elizabeth Winstead trapped in an underground doomsday bunker. John Goodman, always a reliable character actor, is truly impressive here as the apocalypse prepper-slash-abductor. He does a lot with this role, vacillating between scary and untrustworthy, and earnest and reliable. The movie hinges on the characters and their relationships to one another - is Goodman a Good Samaritan, a kook, or something even worse? Given his unreliable narration and questionable motives, it's hard to say, and this is what makes rooting for Winstead so easy. Thankfully, she's not the clueless, helpless woman in distress most horror/thriller movies rely on. She's an honest entry-point into this upside-down world for viewers, but she's also got a bit of gumption and smarts. And, when needed, she can certainly kick ass and take names.

This is the type of slow-burn movie where characters come first, and it's within these characters that we find most of the horror. There is an overriding sense of tension throughout, and you feel like any given scenario the film presents just might devolve into sudden gory disaster. 10 Cloverfield Lane is also written smartly enough to keep us constantly guessing. Just when you think the flick has settled into a groove and you've got it figured out, along comes another curveball that shakes everything up.

7663714,1,B01BLH8R50,"This movie was absolutely horrible. Poor story line, misleading plot, poor character development, ridiculous ""twist"" ending. And this is in no way a sequel to ""Cloverfield"" (which was actually a very good). As I watched this awful movie I found myself feeling more sympathy for John Goodman (the ""bad guy"" / ""crazy & unstable prepper"") than I did for any of the other characters. By the end of the movie I was repulsed at the entire story. I unfortunately saw this movie in the theater and it's one of the few I very nearly asked for my money back after viewing.

I will say the one redeeming quality is very good acting on all the actors/actresses parts, but the terrible story ruins it all.

After being forced off the road, she wakes up with an IV, injured knee, chained to a cot in the premo bomb shelter of Howard (John Goodman) a ""black belt in conspiracy theories."" He claims the air outside is poisonous. She also occupies the shelter with Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) a local who helped build the shelter.

Howard is strange and Michelle doubts his story of Russians or aliens poisoning our air. Howard rules with an iron fist and Michell fears for her life, trapped between the devil she knows and the one that may be outside.

The film was an interesting concept. I wished they had played a clip from the 1961 Twilight Zone episode ""The Shelter"" on Howard's TV instead of ""Pretty in Pink."" As always, Goodman delivers. Definitely worth adding to the collection.

I found myself multitasking, checking in, and waiting on something to happen.  The first half of the film could have been condensed to about fifteen minutes, as only the last half-hour is worth truly sitting down and paying complete attention...at least I thought.  Just when you think it's going to lead to an amazing ending, what you'll find is a hot, bubbling mess.  Seriously.  This ending is ridiculous of epic proportions.

This turned out to be quite an interesting movie.

Every time I see John Goodman, I see Dan Conner.  It always reminds me of Rosanne, back in the old days.  But this is a very different version of John Goodman.  He plays an excellent psychotic character.  The quick changes of emotion, and just how believable he was.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead also plays an excellent character.  Her distrust creates many interesting moments, and even leads to a gruesome discovery or two.  Her fellow actor, John Gallagher Jr. does a fine job as a supporting role.  He doesnt overdo it, and plays his entire role as if he is frightened by Goodman.

The majority of the movie plays as a psychological thriller.  There are constantly questions of whats really going on.  Why is Winstead really in this bunker?  Why did Goodman really take here there?  The ending is a bit Strange.  It isn't bad, but the sci-fi twist really comes to the surface.  I would watch a sequel, focusing more on the events after the ending.

7663800,3,B01BLH8R50,"One or two more rewrites and they would have had something.

The only real problem with this movie is the John Goodman character.  Is he a creep, or is he an eccentric, uncompromising, annoying guy trying to do the right thing under very trying circumstances?  For most of the movie we don't know, and it clocks more like a suspense/soft-core horror movie than a sequel to ""Cloverfield"".  And that's fine.  It's suspenseful, for awhile.  But the writers just aren't skillful enough to juggle their red herrings in an entertaining way and rely instead on a jumble of cliches rather than trying to make what they've been cooking come out in the end.
It's just lazy character and story development.

If they'd hired an actor with more depth for Goodman's part and removed the cheap pedophilia angle he would have been a much more interesting character and the story would have improved enormously.  And the most frustrating part is that after working the good guy/creep angle for almost the entire movie, we never get a satisfactory revelation of his true character.  The issue is dropped with maybe fifteen minutes left in the film.  It's a great fifteen minutes, I admit.  But what were the first eighty-eight minutes for?!",1464912000,,1222,4.855072463768116
7663801,5,B01BLH8R50,"I think my other reviews indicate I'm no easy sell, which is status I don't strive for: let me tell you, ALL of the advance praise for this film is entirely deserved: the plot actually comprises at least three different types/genres of film under the suspense umbrella and constantly shifts and SURPRISES you.

Even lesser actors could've carried the day with this thing.  But do you love John Goodman, like I do?  Man, are you in for A TREAT.  He is fantastic here for reasons I cannot fully divulge. Winstead, so fantastic in ""Smashed"" and other films, is just great here.

7663804,4,B01BLH8R50,"Can't fault anything, but that ending just pissed me off because it was too brief, was almost unlit, and was an abusive tease about a better film to come.....which won't be made.  So that makes it a yet worser ending, because the viewer wants so much more and leaves the theater with scant tidbits about the ""foe.""  It's worth the renting, but I had to buy it; suggest you wait for lower price.  Pretty sure it'll be a long time, before I watch this again.  Give us that sequel!  Sheesh.  Film messed up with that ""filter room"" being inaccessible except how she did it, because there were supplies there and an alternate exit.  Jarring plot misstep.  Acting, dialogue, plot-of-sleuthing-out-the-truth etc. were all top notch, but there were a lot of ""music foretelling evil"" combined with close-up on face moments where one awaits the shocking and sudden ""something bad,"" and then it never came.  Cheap shot scare with no payoff for enduring that misery.  If you come across any spoilers about the ending, that would ruin the film, so avoid that, because in this case, it's really all the film offers, with the trailer fleshing out most of the bulk of the film  There were a couple of shocks not foretold by trailer, and the film needed them -- entertainment was always action driven and hard to find otherwise.",1464739200,9,1311,4.706140350877193

7663810,4,B01BLH8R50,"So... 10 Cloverfield Lane...

I'm not even really sure where to begin honestly.  I'm going to try and avoid spoilers but I will say ""It's not what you think"" is an apt assessment.

Your enjoyment of the movie is going to depend on two things:
1. Your ability to connect with the characters and sympathize with their various positions.
and
2. Your enjoyment of the movies two main schticks.  If the ""trapped by a mad-man"" theme is up your alley, then there's something here for you.  If the other thing is up your alley (I don't want to spoil it), then this is up your alley.

Sadly the real draw for me isn't what the movie ended up being.  I still enjoyed it, but it wasn't anything like I had expected.  That's not a bad thing... but it also isn't really a good thing...

The movie was smarter than I thought it was going to be... while at the same time dumber if that makes sense.  Characters do things for weird and bizarre reasons and the final victory over the real threat just raises more questions like: why not use flamethrowers?  John Goodman's performance steals the show and sadly over shadows the other performances which end up feeling a bit bland in comparison.  The director also did a fantastic job of using the old ""Chekhov's gun"" which he used something like 5 or 6 times throughout the first half of the movie.

The long and short is, rent it don't buy it.  I would be lying if I said I didn't have some level of buyers remorse for spending $15 on a movie which really isn't worth more than $10 for purchase and REALLY should be rented for $5.  That said, it is worth a viewing at some point.",1464652800,2,1612,4.344481605351171
7663811,5,B01BLH8R50,"This is most definitely one of my personal favorite movies of the year. This movie builds up a lot of suspense in both an entertaining and effective way. From beginning to end, I was at the edge of my seat and completely captured by this. This is an excellent movie to watch if you are looking for ""escapism"". The story follows a girl who wakes up in a bomb shelter. She soon finds out that she has been kidnapped/rescued by a strange man (John Goodman). This man claims to have saved her life from an apocalyptic event going on and are safe thanks to his survival shelter. She is skeptical about her situation and questions the man's strange behavior. Throughout the film, she has an internal conflict whether to believe his story or not. Is it actually the end of the world outside this doomsday shelter, or is this entire situation only from this man's crazy/paranoid imagination? If you like tensioned filled movies with a mystery element, this is a must watch. Now that I've already seen the movie, I doubt I will get the same feeling watching it a 2nd time. I won't know for sure until I re-watch it at it's DVD release. I wish I could watch this again for this first time.

7663815,4,B01BLH8R50,"J.J. Abrams and his famed ""mystery box"" have been kicking around for more than his ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" blockbusters. He's played the hand of total secrecy before with a pair of smaller monster flicks, ""Super 8"" and the found footage thriller, ""Cloverfield"", the latter the subject of sequel rumors for years after. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is not that sequel, all titular appearances to the contrary. It is, in more ways than one, a totally different creature from ""Cloverfield""; one that is frequently jarring, brilliantly controlled, and definitely worth going in blind.

""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is at its core a tightly-wound three-person psychological thriller, but debuting feature director Dan Trachtenberg doesn't simply stick to those confines. The outside-the-box thinking begins early as Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) tearfully breaks up with her husband and flees their home, only to fall victim to a bone-rattling car accident that resonates throughout the opening credits. She wakes up, bloody and chained in an ugly stone bunker, looking like the opening victim of a ""Saw"" movie. Moments later she's greeted by the hulking presence of Howard (John Goodman), who tells her she can't leave his underground bunker because the world has been destroyed outside, victim of some kind of attack. Immediately, her and our alarm bells go off. His story sounds crazy; he's talking about nuclear fallout and the air being unbreathable. But he's also surprisingly nice, offering her food, crutches for her busted up leg...of course it's always possible he's fattening her up for the kill....or keeping her around for something far worse.

They aren't alone, either; there's Howard's carpenter friend, Emmitt (John Gallagher, Jr.), who helped build the bunker and corroborates the story. Between him and Howard, it's Emmitt who comes across as more level-headed. Howard is a hard guy to pin down. Is he a total nutcase? Or is he being honest about some kind of apocalypse event? For all of his acts of kindness there's an outburst of pure rage. Couple his paranoia with the natural tension of being crammed in a tight space with two strangers and Howard could be dangerous whether he's telling the truth or not.

The best part of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is trying to decipher the answers to the questions it raises; and the trio of screenwriters, including Oscar-nominated ""Whiplash"" writer Damien Chazelle, keep audiences on their toes by cleverly changing the questions at a moment's notice. A game of charades has Howard inadvertently revealing his negative perception of Michelle and women in general, but what caused him to feel that way? Individual moments like this that shed new light on these characters are what keep the story fresh, something that isn't easy to do in a single location setting. Trachtenberg shows incredible use of space and framing in such close quarters, capturing an uneasiness caused by a combination of claustrophobia, cheap furniture, and half-truths. But you'll laugh just as much as you'll cower in fear as Trachtenberg plays the audience's emotions like a fine-tuned guitar.

With only three major roles each performance's importance is amplified, and all of the stars are at their absolute best. The interesting thing about Goodman is how easily he shifts from cuddly teddy bear to complete psychotic. This is the same guy who played the lovable Dan Connor on ""Roseanne"" and ""The Big Lebowski""'s hair-trigger Walter Sobhak. His performance here combines elements of both to effectively disturbing degrees. Winstead has always been good at playing tough, enigmatic women, but here she's also wildly inquisitive and intuitive. There's the subtle suggestion of personal demons in Michelle's past, and Winstead, whose finest role was as an alcoholic in ""Smashed"", brings a little bit of that addictive persona to her portrayal.

The less said about the ending the better, but suffice it to say the story's tight grip is loosened considerably. It's both a blessing and a curse, as the ultimate reveal is incredibly fun even though the answers prove less engaging than the mystery. Abrams has called ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" a ""blood relative"" to its predecessor, which doesn't mean a heck of a lot. Whether the two films are truly connected doesn't really matter as long as we're allowed more regular visits to Cloverfield Lane.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Cloverfield-Lane-Blu-ray/dp/B01BLH8R50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Cloverfield Lane [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,,4542,5.391549295774648
7663816,3,B01BLH8R50,"Theres a lot of build-up in this one with a debatable payoff. Featuring one of the deepest teases in a film in recent memory - maybe since the last Cloverfield which has nothing to do with this film - the first 80% is devoted to the question of what strange enigma will unravel in the final 20 minutes. While the setup and mystery starts solid and intriguing, it wears thin and repetitive after awhile. Once the viewer realizes that the movie is simply escalating the same suspenseful situation until the big reveal, some might grow impatient at the redundant ruse, while others might not find the finale worth the wait. Certainly if the formula was flipped so that the twist came more towards the beginning, the film wouldve been far more interesting. Thankfully, the production value is strong, as well as Goodman's screwball. But with an unsympathetic lead waiting for a redundant plot, this mediocre Twilight Zone episode really pushes the limits of patience and expectations with the usual mixed results from Jar Jar Abrams.",1463702400,14,1029,4.885714285714286
7663817,3,B01BLH8R50,"Really effective twisting, turning, second-guessing suspense with an ending that hangs around for way too long and disrupts the great atmosphere it had just established. For the most part, this is a fine example of making the most of a small set and an even smaller cast. The three-person acting team draws every bit of fear, loathing, confusion and betrayal from the simple, efficient script. We explore every nook and cranny of John Goodman's bunker until it all feels like home, making for a thrilling game of hide-and-seek when the tension inevitably boils over. The terror is mostly psychological and quiet, which makes the infrequent bursts of sound and fury all the more effective. These aren't just jump-cuts, they're bullets through the fog. They carry meaning and consequence, reverberating well beyond the moment of impact. And if it had ended about ten minutes earlier, the shock of its final reveal would've been maintained without spoiling any of that work. A pity, then, that it reaches all the way into summer blockbuster territory in some vain attempt to tie things into an otherwise-unrelated preceding film. This may not have enjoyed as many eyeballs without that extra word in the title, but it would've been so much more effective as a film.",1462838400,3,1262,5.014285714285714
7663818,5,B01BLH8R50,"Theatrical review. Oh, yeah, this is a good one. Producer J. J. Abrams managed to keep this movie relatively quiet. Maybe he was too busy with the new Star Wars film. In any case, the mention of Cloverfield in the title is certainly no coincidence. While there is no direct connection to the original Cloverfield movie of 2008, there is certainly a familial relationship, if geographically distant. Think about The Walking Dead and its spin-off, Fear the Walking Dead for example. Or the Alien franchise and 2012s Prometheus. In any case, surprise is important here so I will do my best to not give away anything critical beyond what is being shown in the trailers.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Thing) plays Michelle, whose troubled marriage leads her to pack and leave her husband. On her way to who-knows-where, she is involved in an accident and is left unconscious. When she awakens she finds herself tethered to an IV and her damaged leg shackled to a wall. A good Samaritan/captor named Howard (John Goodman, Argo) is also her nurse. In the room next door is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr., Short Term 12) whose arm is in a sling but appears to know Howard pretty well. As Howard explains, Michelle was rescued from her car and brought to his underground bunker just in time as there has been some kind of invasion. Probably involving chemical or nuclear weapons. He suspects the Russkies or Martians. So is Howard evil or crazy, or a little of both? And what is Emmett connection in all of this?

First time director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job keeping the audience guessing for the first 2 acts with the trio becoming more like a family as Howard hopes, but like most families, they have their tiffs. And when Howard becomes upset, wellyou don't want to get him upset. Goodman is terrific in the role. Forget the teddy-bear-like character he often plays. Here he has a wide range of emotions, sometimes seen all at once. The third act belongs to Winstead. Michelle, who has a long history of running away from confrontations and problems must go into survival mode.

While some of the scientific aspects of the underground bunker seem a little suspect, that is a small nit to pick. The movie is frightening, filled with tension and legitimate terror. The best movie I've seen so far this year. Highly recommended.",1462838400,6,2325,4.764267990074441

10 Cloverfield Lane centers around a woman who, upon waking up in a doomsday shelter, is now left to wonder if her saviors are safer or more dangerous than what may or may not lay outside.

In short, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Top notch performances, intelligent & exceptionally suspenseful writing and chilling camera work all add up to a truly wonderful thriller. Admittedly, as a fan of the previous Cloverfield, I was a little bummed that Lane took a new direction. However, new direction doesn't always mean bad direction. This one's a winner in all regards.

7663826,4,B01BLH8R50,"10 Cloverfield Lane is directed by J.J. Abrams and stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as 'Michelle' and John Goodman as 'Howard'.  I would like to start this review off by saying that I like weird horror movies, not typical slasher or plots where you can guess what happens next.  This movie did one very big thing that I need in not just a horror movie, but any movie.  I was not sure what the truth would be throughout the entire movie until it is revealed. John Goodman (Howard) has a story and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) doesn't quite believe it, and it is hard to guess who is right all the way until the end.

The acting from both main characters and the a secondary character (John Gallagher Jr. as Emmett) was excellent.  The setting for this movie is very small and I think that the actors and direction made the most of it.  Goodman definitely keeps you on edge throughout the movie wondering if he is psychotic, evil or delusional.  Winstead, who seems to be a bit of a scream queen keeps her character believable throughout and doesn't become irritatingly stupid, desperate or over the top, keeping to a bit of realism. And Gallagher does his part in the story believably.

The plot can run a little slow at times though, I will concede that.  That is the main reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  There are minutes of the movie that feel like filler, and even though they push the story forward or show a passage of time, they feel a little clunky and struggled to keep my attention.

Overall I think this is definitely a great horror movie, but it is not full of action like Cloverfield AT ALL.  It is much more psychological and has much more build-up for plot than any shock and awe.  If you are into offbeat horror and willing to muddle through little parts, I would highly recommend this movie.

Oh, and also, this movie could really open the door to a whole new type of sequel.",1461110400,3,1902,4.443804034582133
7663827,2,B01BLH8R50,"After all the build-up, I was not impressed. The poor lighting that made it hard to see clearly -- I don't know why so many filmmakers do that now-- but the kicker was the female lead who kept doing dumb stuff like standing out in the open whenever she saw something dangerous and running across open fields and doing everything she could to draw attention to herself.

I also didn't appreciate this film pretending to be a sequel to the original ""Cloverfield""

I can't recommend this film.",1461110400,,490,4.620689655172414
7663828,5,B01BLH8R50,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is great! This is how the story goes: Soon after leaving her fianc, Michelle is involved in a car accident. She awakens to find herself sharing an underground bunker with Howard and Emmett. Has she been saved from an apocalyptical event as Howard & Emmett tell her or are there other motives for her being held against her will?

The cast led by John Goodman (effectively creepy as Howard), Mary Elizabeth Winstead (solid as Michelle) & John Gallagher Jr. (also solid as Emmett) is great. The directing by Dan Trachtenberg is great. The story by Josh Campbell & Matthew Stuecken and the screenplay by Campbell, Stuecken & Damien Chazelle is great.

The music by Bear McCreary is great. The cinematography by Jeff Cutter is great. The film editing by Stefan Grube is great. The casting by Monika Mikkelsen is great. The production design by Ramsey Avery is great.

You don't.  It also feels a bit slow around that point but hang in there with it.  It gets better soon enough!  I'd also add that I saw this with my 14 year old daughter.  I hesitated to bring her because I had a pretty good idea of what it was about and didn't want to scare the crap out of her or expose her to adult situations.  It is scary at times but it's not overly goory or grotesque or anything like that.  The language was not bad at all and there was no nudity.  If anything, I jumped and screamed more than she did, lol.

I have one big complaint about the movie but I am not going to let it lower my star rating.  The movie is a thriller that keeps you thinking during the whole thing.  Without spoiling the ending, I will say you do get 'some' closure at the end of it.  However, what you really get is a segue into a sequel which leaves you hanging a bit.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against sequels.  However, what I really wanted at the end of this movie was some closure so I could feel a weight lifted off my shoulders when it was done.

Tensions mount as she and another bunk mate assess their situation as they try to discover what really happened up above and whether their savior can actually be trusted.

This latest thriller is the latest entry into J.J. Abrams Cloverfield anthology. Yes, at this point, it is safe to say that there may not be a REAL Cloverfield sequel. It very well takes place in the same universe, but it doesnt follow up on the event from the first film. But do not let this disappoint you. I will go as far to say that this is even better than Cloverfield. The tagline for the film nails it when it says monsters come in many forms. The monster in question is Howard played by John Goodman. Right from the get-go you get this strong sense of unease around him, but there are also certain moments where you feel like he can be trusted. That is the brilliance of this superbly crafted script and the performances. Throughout the film you are literally sucked into the world and mind-sets of these characters. You feel the tension between everyone, as well as the fear, and sense of unease as the our two captured characters. Even the small moments of humor emit a sense of nervous laughter. It is due to this and the amazing cinematography that you feel just as trapped in this bunker as Michelle and Emmett. The characters also come off as super realistic and are so well-developed you genuinely feel like you know them and you really like them. So as the tension and thrills escalate you fear for them. Scenes such as the initial dinner scene between the three characters and a game of 20 Questions are just a couple of the tension-filled scenes that left me on edge. There are even moments of shock where things just happen out of nowhere that cause you to drop your jaw where you cant believe that just happened. It all leads to a final act that goes out with a bang.

The performance by the very small cast was perfection. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as our leading lady and heroine Michelle, plays the role with so much ease. Shes a genuinely likable character who feels real in her emotions and the problems she faces within herself. In her moments of terror, she plays it out in a way that comes off as real and not over-dramatized. Shes just someone you root for the whole time, comparable to Ripley from the Alien films. Likable, smart, and resourceful. Next we have John Gallagher, Jr as Emmett. Hes more or less the major comic relief of the film but doesnt get carried away. Hes the one who tries to keep Michelle at ease. Gallagher, Jr. plays out the humor perfectly and has many sincere moments that make him just as likable as Michelle. Finally, and mostly there is John Goodman as Howard. Words cannot describe the performance he gives. It is honestly an Oscar worthy performance. He was so damn intimidating just watching him on-screen, that even even the smallest things or movements he did left you on edge. He could be totally calm one moment but instantly snap and leave you freaked. But its even his moments of calm that leave you uneasy. But like our characters, Goodman does a terrific job of leaving you wondering whether or not he can be trusted.

Never before have I seen a film like this (or at least in a while) that to me was perfection in every aspect in filmmaking. The script, directing, overall production, acting, etc. was something that I would not have expected. Again, the fact that this is not a direct sequel to Cloverfield should NOT discourage you from seeing this amazing piece of cinema that will leave you breathless and on edge throughout the whole film.

7663839,5,B01BLH8R50,"Theatrical review. Oh, yeah, this is a good one. Producer J. J. Abrams managed to keep this movie relatively quiet. Maybe he was too busy with the new Star Wars film. In any case, the mention of Cloverfield in the title is certainly no coincidence. While there is no direct connection to the original Cloverfield movie of 2008, there is certainly a familial relationship, if geographically distant. Think about The Walking Dead and its spin-off, Fear the Walking Dead for example. Or the Alien franchise and 2012s Prometheus. In any case, surprise is important here so I will do my best to not give away anything critical beyond what is being shown in the trailers.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Thing) plays Michelle, whose troubled marriage leads her to pack and leave her husband. On her way to who-knows-where, she is involved in an accident and is left unconscious. When she awakens she finds herself tethered to an IV and her damaged leg shackled to a wall. A good Samaritan/captor named Howard (John Goodman, Argo) is also her nurse. In the room next door is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr., Short Term 12) whose arm is in a sling but appears to know Howard pretty well. As Howard explains, Michelle was rescued from her car and brought to his underground bunker just in time as there has been some kind of invasion. Probably involving chemical or nuclear weapons. He suspects the Russkies or Martians. So is Howard evil or crazy, or a little of both? And what is Emmett connection in all of this?

First time director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job keeping the audience guessing for the first 2 acts with the trio becoming more like a family as Howard hopes, but like most families, they have their tiffs. And when Howard becomes upset, wellyou don't want to get him upset. Goodman is terrific in the role. Forget the teddy-bear-like character he often plays. Here he has a wide range of emotions, sometimes seen all at once. The third act belongs to Winstead. Michelle, who has a long history of running away from confrontations and problems must go into survival mode.

While some of the scientific aspects of the underground bunker seem a little suspect, that is a small nit to pick. The movie is frightening, filled with tension and legitimate terror. The best movie I've seen so far this year. Highly recommended.",1459382400,83,2325,4.764267990074441

And in all honesty i think the movie could've been even better if the ending was different. But in an attempt to tie it to the first movie it weighs down the actual film. Not to the point where i'd knock it down a star but it would've been flawless had the ending been different. The ending is not out of place as most people say it is because SPOILER ALERT: It is hinted throughout the movie there are aliens invading. END OF SPOILER. All performances were amazing, this was a major flaw with the first movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman pull off amazing performances as usual along with John Gallagher who although I'm not familiar with did do an amazing job as well. Very intense thriller i would like to see a continuation of this movie showing SPOILER ALERT: What happens when Michelle heads to a more populated area. END OF SPOILER.

7663843,5,B01BLH8R50,"I'm a huge fan of the original Cloverfield, so when I saw that a teaser was released for a movie called 10 Cloverfield Lane, I was very excited.  The teaser didn't reveal much except that it wasn't a found footage film, but like the first teaser for Cloverfield it was mysterious and instantly piqued my interest.  A few articles were released with JJ Abrams saying the movie isn't a sequel but more of a blood relative that takes place within the same universe.  Admittedly I was a little disappointed that it wasn't a sequel, but I still wanted to see the movie.

I got a chance to see 10 Cloverfield Lane this past weekend, and it blew me away.  I don't want to go into much detail about the plot, but everyone should know by now that at least part of the movie takes place in a bunker where Howard (John Goodman) is holding/sheltering Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) along with another guy (John Gallagher Jr.).  Michelle wakes up in the bunker after a car accident.  Howard tells her that she can't leave because there's been some sort of attack and it's not safe on the outside.  What follows the opening is one of the most suspenseful times at the movies I've experienced.

Throughout the movie there's a sense of dread and impending doom.  John Goodman puts forth an Oscar-worthy performance, showing Howard go from protecting father figure to unbalanced kidnapper and back again, sometimes in the same scene.  One scene, early on, at the dinner table had me gripping the arms of my seat so tight my fingers ached.  As a matter of fact, I was tensed for the entire 100+ minutes of the movie.  Even when things seem fine between the three characters, Howard just seems ready to pop, ready to fly into a rage.

The suspense that builds for the first hour explodes into nail-biting, seat-gripping, nerve-racking tense action.  The last 30 minutes or so are intense with more ties to the Cloververse coming to light.  I can't (and won't) reveal what happens to make it a Cloverfield movie, but what happens was very satisfying for me.  I thought it did both the movie as a standalone and the movie as part of the Cloververse justice.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie to not just fans of the first Cloverfield but to anyone who likes a good suspenseful movie.  It plays like a movie-length Twilight Zone episode or a Hitchcockian thriller.  John Goodman is superb and should be considered for an Oscar.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. and great as well.  I think fans of the first Cloverfield will love it with its ""ties"" to the original, and anyone else who likes a good thriller will be amazed.",1459209600,3,2625,4.636363636363637
7663844,4,B01BLH8R50,"Please don't walk into this film believing that this is going to be sci-fi/ action film similar to J.J. Abraham's ""Cloverfield.""

However, this is the type of psychological thriller that would make Alfred Hitchcock proud.

There are essentially only three characters in the film - Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Howard (John Goodman) and Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) and nearly all of the action takes place in three claustrophobic rooms.

The antagonist of this film is Goodman's Howard. After watching Goodman for years as the affable husband in ""Rosanne,"" we tend to forget how intimidating this hulking actor can be when given the proper script. In this movie, the viewer has to determine whether or not he's a visionary who foresaw Armageddon prior to its occurrence or a conspiracy theorist who lost his last sliver of sanity.

The other actors in this movie make this a really compelling film as well. I had never seen Winstead or Gallagher in any other film. However, both of them turned in outstanding performances as bewildered and frightened ""guests"" of Howard.

There's a really interesting sequence in the third act of this film that is polarizing. Frankly, you will either love how the film ended or hate it. No matter which side you take, this is a fascinating film that is worth several different views to pick up clues hidden in plain sight that you may not have caught on the first viewing.

Howard is strange and Michelle doubts his story of Russians or aliens poisoning our air. Howard rules with an iron fist and Michell fears for her life, trapped between the devil she knows and the one that may be outside.

7663847,5,B01BLH8R50,"Late one night, a young woman is driving down a dark and lonely road, having decided to leave her lover, only to be knocked out while having an accident. She wakes up chained to the floor of a windowless room with no idea where she is or how she got there.  A large, burly and pretty scary man appears and tells her she's been injured in a car accident and needs to rest up but she needs to know something unknown but clearly apocalyptic has happened to the world and he has saved her life.  Everyone outside is either dead or dying. Is he telling the truth, is he lying or is he insane?  She has no idea and neither will you for a large part of the film.

John Goodman is riveting in his role as the ex-millitary survivalist who has built his own personal underground shelter to ride out the end of the world, an event he has always expected and has dedicated his life to be ready for. It turns out there is a third person, a young, pleasant but not physically intimidating local laborer who helped Goodman build his fortress. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as the young woman is very effective in her role as she desparately tries to figure out what is going on, what is true and what isn't and whether or not the real monster is actually John Goodman.  The film works emotionally as Goodman really sells his role as an emotional powderkeg. This is most defintely not a person you'd want to be locked up with. Plus, the audience never knows more than the young woman at any point.  Eventually, of course, we will all find out what is actually going on in the outside world.

I particularly loved the performances along with the fact that the audience never knows more than the characters themselves.  It's not at all your average monster movie, but be warned, the truth is out there.",1458864000,12,1779,4.402439024390244

Unfortunately, the decor and workings of the bunker (however unrealistic) ended up being the only interesting parts for me.  I love psychological thrillers but I just didn't find this one thrilling.  Yes, it kept us guessing, but one of the first twists came and went (the lady in the window) without any explanation (""I only got a little of it on me."").

7663854,4,B01BLH8R50,"10 CloverField Lane is best enjoyed knowing as little as possible about the film. Watching the original Cloverfield first won't hurt though and will likely add to the tension. As much as I loved the fantastic 10CFL trailers, Id suggest that you avoid them. If you have seen the trailers and enjoyed them, you will enjoy the movie. The mood is the same.

If I had to categorize this film, I would say its a hybrid thriller with a touch of mystery, horror and sci-fi.

The plot: Three people are trying to co-habitate in a survivalists underground bunker in an attempt to avoid the toxic atmosphere above. The toxic atmosphere may be due to an enemy invasion or a hoax. What is actually going on in the outside world is beyond their knowledge or understanding. Suspicions, arise between the bunker occupants. To say anymore would spoil the film.

My review will only cover the performances and quality of the film avoiding plot and spoilers.

All the performances were outstanding. John Goodman plays a Howard, an ""is he or isn't he a psycho."" For my money John should be nominated for an academy award. His performance needed to be a person with many parts: intimidating, eccentric, confident, inept, sad, genius, pathetic, selfish, magnanimous, threatening, sympathetic, unintentionally funny and yet a very real and whole person. Johns performance was extremely important to making the film work.

Marry Elizabeth Winstead was equally outstanding as Michelle. She is the character that most people will either identify with or have empathy for. She is the character that the audience spends time alone with so we get to know her inner world. Mary is highly attractive yet retains a simple girl next door quality which makes her relate-able and not a clichd model in distress. She has the task of showing an outward persona of confidence and cooperation along with an inner world of suspicion, fear, plotting, desperation and even aggression. She manages all these things very believably and she gets us to worry for her.

The third occupant, Emmit, played by John Gallagher Jr. This character is very familiar guy in both appearance and attitude. Low ambition, means well, goes along to get along, doesnt make waves, timid, a little sad and a bit of the white knight syndrome. His part is not complex, and he is not intended to be a deep person, but he is real . He does an exceptionally good job playing the subtle nuances of this character.

That makes three near perfect performances.

As a bit of a film nut, who studies these types of things. I would suggest 10CL is a good lesson for script writers for the proper use of foreshadowing and metaphors. Almost any innocent prop that comes to the forefront may be a catalyst for an idea or serve as an important prop or a metaphor later in the film. A picture of a cat, a shower curtain, a bottle of booze, a tee shirt, an ice-cream cone etc are serve as for either for-shadowing or metaphors. Each time one of these moments is revealed there is an ah ha moment that really movies this film forward.

Another important aspect that makes this a very smart movie is that all the characters never act out of character. Without giving anything away John Goodmans character coming up with ""little girl"" or ""little princes"" in a game of charades is an appropriately creepy example. Or Johns Gallaghers character white knighting to point of his detriment. Or Marys constant suspicions, scheming, manipulations, lying and plotting.

The film sets a level of suspense, curiosity, tension and dread and holds it there for long periods of time broken only occasionally by a moment of dark humor, or a shock. There are some genuine thrills and some twists that are often outright unexpected. Some of these elicited shouts from the audience. I also noticed that many in the audience winced or made noise when a character was hurt. This shows the audience was really relating to the actors performances.

What I didn't like about the film is difficult to spell out without creating a spoiler and it's why I took off a star. I suggest you don't read further even though Im going to try to avoid spoiling.

The film does take a hard turn to the left somewhere along the line close to the end. While I agree that the film had to do this to be satisfying, it could have been handled better. This may not be the directors fault since at this point allot is depending on CG and editors. The payoff is rendered in such a way that these final scenes seem contrived, convenient, rushed and at times almost silly. This section of the film needed a minimum of high B+ for execution, but it rated an average C or worse in my book. Kind of fun and imaginative but it was also neither scary or suspenseful and way too familiar.

For me that was a disappointment but did not ruin the film at all. After all 10CL does have Cloverfield in the title. So we all knew we were going to have something Cloverfield-like was going to happen, just not as good.

Thinking about the film afterwards, I realized there were a number of devices or plot points that didn't make sense, which I won't bother to go into especially since these things did not stick out during the film.

I highly recommended 10 Cloverfield Lane but its not for everyone. Its got a smart script, great acting, interesting characters, thrills suspense, psychology, atmosphere and wonderful film making techniques. But you will be needing an open imagination and suspending your disbelief may be requirement. For film makers or film students it's a great film for studying the use foreshadowing devices and metaphors  which the film uses continuously. 10 Cloverfield Lane is worthy of sharing the same name in its title as the fantastic but very different Cloverfield.",1458518400,,5752,4.737

7663857,4,B01BLH8R50,"Two months ago, to the shock and surprise of the entire movie side of the Internet, Bad Robot dropped an unexpected teaser trailer in front of showings of the Michael Bay-directed Benghazi movie, 13 Hours. Depicting a woman stuck in some sort of shelter, the trailers biggest secret was revealed at the end  it was a Cloverfield movie, titled 10 Cloverfield Lane.

The long discussed, often dissected Bad Robot Mystery Box is in play again  eight years after Cloverfield gave new life to the giant monster film (after some surprise marketing), moviegoers have another installment of the franchise (of sorts) with director Dan Trachtenbergs debut.

The movie puts us in the shoes of Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Scott Pilgrim). An aspiring fashion designer, we see her leave her fianc in the movies opening sequence. As she is driving away from the life she knew, her car is struck is struck by another, sending her flying off of the road. Michelle awakes injured in a locked room  unaware of her surroundings or situation. The door opens  and on the other side stands Howard (John Goodman, Argo). Gruff and no-nonsense, Howard tells her that a chemical attack has occurred above ground, that he saved her, and now they  along with a third survivor, Emmitt (John Gallagher Jr., The Newsroom)  must stay underground, as it is their only chance of survival.

And thats about all the plot I am willing to discuss. The film that follows is intense, tension filled, and an absolute joy to take in. Trachtenberg has a hell of a pot-boiler here for his first film, and despite only holding three characters in one central location, is more engaging and in-depth than some of the bigger, globe trotting adventures we see hitting the cineplex these days. Characters motivations grow and change, as do our opinions of them, revelations come to light, and the scale and scope shifts all the way to the movies final reel, where  of course  all hell breaks loose.

Perhaps its the fact that I have seen this movie so close to finishing the brilliant video game Firewatch, but many moments of 10 Cloverfield Lane feel video game-y. Not to say that the movie is without merit or weight, as many critics would use the term, but instead the film feels like a well crafted adventure tale.

The more we learn about the characters, the more we see them grow, and the more aware of the environment we become, the greater our understanding of the situation is. Add the fact that there are moments of reveal and discovery, 10 Cloverfield Lane will feel right at home for those currently obsessed with the games from Telltale and other point-and-click adventures.

Its a long way to go around it, but thats to say that the movie is clearly created by one of the video game generation, and it results in a suspense thriller that feels both modern and completely throwback in the same moment. Bear McCrearys bombastic score helps sell the throwback notion, with tunes that could easily have scored some of Hitchcocks classics.

With only three characters, 10 Cloverfield Lane could feel claustrophobic, but instead, the script (by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stucken and Damien Chazelle) allows you to learn much about each character by their actions and dialogue. No one fits a perfect mold. Youll always be asking questions  who is right, who is wrong, and what is the real truth.

Michelle is a woman running away from her past, but is also incredibly independent and resourceful. Howard is equally fatherly and inviting, while incredibly haunting and threatening. Winstead and Goodman both get to shine in very different lights  Winstead feels like a Sigourney Weaver-esq action heroine (and Id love to see her grow into that role), and Goodman delivers a greatest hits of his filmography, showing the warmth we loved from him in Roseanne, yet a cutting intensity. Gallaghers Emmitt is a solid glue to the film, with an open heart and believability. He gets short thrift to his story, but provides perfect levity to the tension. Also  theres a great audio cameo from a JJ Abrams alum. See if you can guess it. (And no Googling!)

While I walked away from the film absolutely delighted with the results, I did have some nits to pick  mostly involving the ending. Without going into spoilers, I feel like the movie couldve ended a beat or two early. But thats honestly the worst thing I can say.

10 Cloverfield Lane delivers incredible performances, a fantastic and intense level of tension and excitement, and rewards movie goers on the promise of the Mystery Box. Dan Trachtenberg is now on my list of directors to watch, and the Cloverfield franchise is now born as a series where anything can happen.",1458432000,4,4681,4.832290362953692
7663858,1,B01BLH8R50,"I was waiting for some type of terror or shock to happen, small bits at least, the movie kept promising that, but all we get are talky scenes from the characters about their turmoil growing up. A few scenes like that are needed in a film but when the lead is telling her life history for the 5th time in a corner, I tend to tune out. The dialogue never pushed the story forward in any way, and if it did, their was no action to back it all, just more talking. I'm shocked really. The low budget was evident with scenes of the cast sitting in a corner blabbing about nothing. Terror was 10%, yapping 90%. Rent it , but you may not finish it.

7663863,4,B01BLH8R50,"When J.J. Abrams isn't producing/directing huge films like Star Trek or Star Wars, he's doing movies more like this which are a bit smaller but have a greater human element to them. This has his thumbprints all over it.

Here's the scoop. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has just had a big argument with her boyfriend. She packs her car and hits the road. She gets in a bad, rollover accident and wakes up in a bunker with a bum leg  and locked in one of the rooms of said bunker. Her captor, Howard (John Goodman), says he has, in fact, saved her as there has been some sort of attack and if she goes outside she will immediately perish. Another resident, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) knows Howard and believes him. But Howard seems more than a bit nuts so she doesn't really know if he's on the up and up. What's a girl to do?

This is a very crafty plot. Howard DOES seem nuts, but he might be telling the truth. Emmett seems nice enough but is he playing the good cop in a good cop, bad cop routine? Michelle sees things first hand that lend credence to Howard's version of things. But she then begins to discover other things that suggest she isn't the first girl to have spent time in this bunker. If Howard is telling the truth, and she tries to escape, it's all over for her. If he's lying doesn't try to escape it's all over for her. The plot twist almost endlessly and it really kept me in the game. When the climax hits later in the third act my knuckles were white and I was clenching my back teeth. This really builds up a head of steam.

This is director Dan Trachtenberg's first time at the helm of a feature length film and he does a sweet job. The bunker set is small and you DO feel the claustrophobia but the limited space does not detract from things. All the acting is top shelf. The tightening and loosening of the grip is also of note. It all just seems to work so well. There is one aspect of the climax that is a bit too Hollywood but that aside this is still a heck of a ride.

This is a thriller with one huge surprise at the end. It might not change your life but it is about as good as any of its kind.",1458172800,43,2133,4.16747572815534
7663864,4,B01BLH8R50,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016 release; 103 min.) brings the story of Michelle. As the movie opens, we see her packing her things and leaving an apartment, leaving the keys and an engagement ring on the counter. While driving out of New Orleans, the boyfriend calls and tries to convince her to come back. Next thing we know, Michelle is in a terrible car accident (all this is before the movie's opening titles). When Michelle wakes up, she finds herself in a windowless room, literally chained to the wall. Her captor, Howard, informs her that ""I'm sorry, but nobody is looking for you"" that he's keeping her for her own sake. What is going on? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the spiritual follow-up to 2008's ""Cloverfield"", the surprise box office hit about aliens invading Manhattan. Don't call this a sequel, though. The story line has nothing to do with the earlier movie. Here, we get a movie that reminds of Stephen King's ""Misery"" in a way: Howard claims to have rescued Michelle, but did he really or is he a kidnapper? The brilliant thing about this film is that it keeps you guessing pretty much throughout. Just when you think you're onto something, the plot-heavy movie surprises you once more. And the last 30 min. are just out of this world. This is directed by newcomer Dan Trachtenberg, who, under the tutelage of producer J.J. Abrams, does a phenomenal job in crafting this mystery-thriller. The acting performances are top-notch, starting with John Goodman as Howard, but Mary Elizabeth Winstead, best known from indie movies like ""Smashed"" and ""A.C.O.D."", is equally impressive as Michelle. John Gallagher, Jr. as Emmett rounds out the cast (yes, one could say that the majority of a movie is a filmed play set in a bunker). The boyfriend who calls Michelle early in the movie is voiced by... Bradley Cooper! Last but not least, there is a very nice orchestral score, courtesy of composer Bear McCreary, reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's scores for Alfred Hitchcock's movies.

""10 Cloverfield Lane"" opened this past weekend nationwide. I had seen the trailer a number of times, and couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not nearly as packed as I had expected it to be. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a good mystery-thriller, you can count on having a finger-lickin' good time with this movie. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1458172800,,2551,4.821917808219178
7663865,4,B01BLH8R50,"The Good:
It's pretty easy to say that John Goodman (plays ""Howard"") carries this movie for the most part. Goodman continued to show different dynamics of his character that would constantly make you think, ""What's this guy's deal?"". He was by far the most intriguing character despite the fact that Mary Elizabeth Winstead ( plays ""Michelle"") is the obvious lead.

Similar to the previous Cloverfield film, the movie continues the same approach of keeping a level of mystery until the latter part of the film. The good part about this is that you become invested into the film because you don't know any more or less than the main character.

There are some moments that are genuinely suspenseful and thrilling. Given the fact that you're kept in the dark about who the characters are,  the film really does keep you in the moment from scene to scene. You have no idea what may or may not be actually happening in the outside world either. There are just enough twists and turns to keep you wondering about what will happen next.

The Bad:
If you were expecting this to be a movie about aliens, then you'll be in for a disappointment. The film focuses heavily on the characters and the drama they ensue while being in the bunker. Some of the scenes kind of drag a bit because the movie wanted to build up the characters in different ways. I think that, again, if you were expecting this to focus more on the alien threat from the previous film, then the build up the characters just won't matter as much to you. (Except for John Goodman's character.)

The Reason:
10 Cloverfield Lane isn't really a sequel per se. Unless I missed something, it felt like a stand alone film that happened in the ""Cloverfield universe"". When you see the end of the film, you'll be able to see how the two films connect. This movie is more of a thriller than it is a sci-fi flick. I'd say it's more of Misery + War of the Worlds, or something like that. Unfortunately, I can't really say much more without giving too much away, so I'll just say that this was enjoyable and worth the watch. I think that if you liked Cloverfield then you'll more than likely also like 10 Cloverfield too. It's not something you'd have to rush to the theaters to see. If/when you do decide to see it, I don't think many people will be disappointed.

7663869,5,B01BLH8R50,"This is one of the most sophisticatedly written, powerfully acted, and genuinely creepy and thrilling films of the last decade that by credits roll, indeed begs the question...which monster is the most terrifying?  Goodman offers the performance of his career as Norman, who can be both eerily endearing and downright deranged nearly and flawlessly within seconds of each other.  Winstead is equally remarkable as the involuntary heroine who demonstrates an authentic blend of bravery, resourcefulness, and abject fear.  The appropriately small cast is rounded out by Gallagher, who provides a discomforting levity to such a bizarrely claustrophobic and unsettling situation.  In an age of blockbuster messes, this is what indie films, in fact, silver screen offerings overall, should aspire to be; amazing effects that don't oversell themselves and a brilliant script that achieves several rarities.  First; creating actual and unpredictable suspense with twists and turns that, when they impact, do so, like a freight truck with its brake line cut.  Second; utter audience engagement and investment into a story and characters in which it and their unknown fates remain intact until the precise moment they are effortlessly and perfectly executed.  Finally, and most importantly; it delivers deeply disturbing inferences that are far more horrifying than what is actually visually revealed; an extremely impressive feat in this CGI-laden dumbed down era of assembly line cinema.  In a world of social media diarrhea, Abrams has become a master of covert movie tactics and this latest endeavor is a prime example of his effectiveness.  In addition to all the successes listed, he completes his achievement by leaving open two definitive possibilities.  That this event occurs simultaneously with this first film without becoming either a prequel or sequel as he originally touted many moons ago.  And, leaving ambiguous room for another installment, which like this, can take this blossoming franchise in any direction JJ's miraculously creative heart desires.",1458000000,11,2061,5.531847133757962
7663870,3,B01BLH8R50,"I cannot give this review without issuing a spoiler alert. If you haven't already seen the movie I suggest not reading any further than where it says <<<<<<<spoiler alert>>>>>>>>  unless you want to know what happens in the end.

10 Cloverfield Lane is another movie with J.J. Abrams' name attached to it. That fact, and the fact that the first movie named Cloverfield in 2008 are the only resemblances to one another. But, that is enough to compare the two movies and almost consider 10 Cloverfield Lane as a sequelbut not quite.

The movie stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Dan Trachtenberg's first time direction is backed up and supported by J.J. Abrams whose influence can be felt throughout this film.

The movie gives a creepy feeling to anyone watching it. The classic story of a young girl held captive by a homicidal lunatic, with, of course, right wing wacko leanings, played absolutely masterfully by John Goodman. But, this young-girl-held-captive-by-creepy-pervert scenario has some twists to it that shake that old formula and build a pretty decent high concept story line. That is if you favor hard suspense, with lots of sexual tension without the actual gratuitous rape scenes and are interested in stories that show the world being invaded by space aliens.

It might not sound like it, but it works, trust me.

The other twist is a third wheel to the Goodman/Winstead confrontation, a simple but decent guy, played by John Gallagher, who we learn convinced Goodmans Howard to let him in his bunker to survive whatever drove them there in the first place.

Most of the movie is bound by some unseen enemy which has attacked and presumably killed most of the American population, Howard (Goodman) blaming it on the Chinese, or the Ruskies. You can tell by his language, mannerisms, and perceived world view, that he has extreme right wing tendencies. Just once I wish Hollywood would build these characters to be left wing supported with something like a combined Muslim offensive against the United States, which would be much more believable than hanging on to a cold war lunacy which has long passed us by. Most people watching this movie were probably not even born the last time the Ruskies actually were a threat.

Someone should tell these Hollywood writers that the Russians don't hate us anymore, at least not like the Islamic world. There are tensions, sure, but we can talk to and understand them.  Can you say the same thing about the rising Jihad mentality covering Arab Islam today and large swaths of the rest of the Muslim world? And, the same goes for the Communist Chinese. Are they even Communist in 2016?

<<<<<<<<<<<<Spoiler alert!>>>>>>>>>>> Don't read past here unless you want to know what happens or have already seen the film.

The story bears some similarities to some other like movies that have come before, disappointingly weakening the script and one of the reasons it only received three stars in my opinion. One, appears to be an expansion of the scene from the Steven Spielbergs 2005 remake of War of the Worlds when Tom Cruz and his daughter were taken in by the Tim Robbins character. Cruz has to deal with Robbins character only to be thrust into a world which questions which nemesis was worse, Tim Robbins slimy performance or the Martians?

The same happens in 10 Cloverfield Lane Michele (Winstead) is forced to confront Howard in order to make her escape, and like ""War of the Worlds faces the same malevolent inhuman enemy when she finally makes it outside. Thus, we have the tagline for the movie, Monsters come in many forms.

But, we really aren't treated to the similarity of the Steven Spielberg story until the last fifteen minutes of the movie when Michele escapes and makes her way to the sunshine and we find out for the first time who they are hiding from. Noticing a flock of birds flying in formation across the background of a beautiful blue sky immediately gives Michele a sense of relief that what Howard had told her about the air being contaminated was false. Granting a momentary relief that this might be the end of a really bad dream.

But, that relief is short lived almost as quickly she learns that there was indeed an attack but it was not of this earth. It was something more sinister. Like in the first ""Cloverfield"" movie, where we don't learn about aliens and what is destroying New York City until half way through the film ""10 Cloverfield Lane's"" aliens also don't appear until very late in the film. I have to believe that is part of Abrams' influence.

Fans of the genre might see a connection to the 2011 film Battle: Los Angeles which Santa Monica is substituted for East Texas and you experience what might be the beginning of the attack of 10 Cloverfield Lane. The alien ships have a similar look and sound you will not mistake if you have seen both movies. The writers have borrowed from these kinds of stories, either consciously or unconsciously. Either way, they make it work. And, what you have is director Trachtenbergs thoroughly enjoyable film

This high concept structure provides the significant suspense built on two planes. One, is the ""monster"" inside the bunker, below ground, the life work of our wacko Howard character, and then the enemy above ground, an alien invasion from somewhere, out there. We don't learn enough about them to know anything more than they are just not us, leaving the audience to consider the evil of both of Michele's predicaments.

Our heroin escapes both ""monsters"" and at the end of the movie turns toward Houston, Texas where she heard on a radio frequency in the car she took from Howards secluded farm that the resistance was forming among the human survivors and we are fighting back, a perfect segue into a sequel. We'll see.

Except for my problems with the style points already mentioned above, all in all It wasn't a bad movie. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.",1458000000,23,5951,4.783625730994152

In a movie like 10 Cloverfield Lane, it's actually a necessity.

This movie is one part mystery, one part thriller, and one part survival story. The constant shifts in tone keep the audience unsettled, never feeling quite safe that we know what's going on. There are science fiction elements, but they're more window dressing than anything that takes center stage. At it's heart the message of this story is that no matter what happens, never stop the fight. If I were to sum Michelle, our protagonist, up in one word, that word would be fighter. From beginning to end, through all the mental twists that the plot takes us through, that one point is a fixed truth that everything else revolves around. Like a Foucault Pendulum.

7663875,4,B01BLH8R50,"Nine Things About the Film ""10 Cloverfield Lane""

1. This movie is not a sequel to Cloverfield. The only surface connection between the movies is that they both have the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title. Sharp observers (or those following the Tagruato Corporation website) will notice that both movies take place in the same universe, but that's all. You can watch this movie without knowing that Cloverfield even exists.

2. This is not a horror movie. It's a thriller with some science fiction elements thrown in. Don't expect this movie to be scary. You will be disappointed.

3. It's about a woman named Michelle who is freaking out about her boyfriend. While driving through rural Louisiana in the night, gets into a car accident. She wakes up in a bunker with two other men, and is told she can't leave for a couple of years.

4. Most of the stuff you see in the trailer happens in the first half of the film.

5. The movie is told strictly from Michelle's point of view, so you are just as confused as she is. You also become just as suspicious and paranoid as she does.

6. John Goodman does an awesome job in this movie, as a doomsday prepper and conspiracy theorist trying to hold himself together in a situation that he didn't quite imagine.

7. There is some real suspense in this movie, as well as some plot twists that I honestly didn't see coming.

8. Some people will find the movie anti-climactic and not worth the build up (see point 2). But I thought it was well done; it fit the story's idea that everybody can be right, and everybody can be wrong, all at the same time.

9. This is a tightly crafted paranoid thriller. If you can forget about the movie's namesake and just go in blind, it will take you on a worthwhile journey. I'm hoping there will be a third movie that's not a sequel.",1457827200,16,1808,4.454545454545454

7663877,5,B01BLH8R50,"Theatrical review.  Oh, yeah, this is a good one.  Producer J. J. Abrams managed to keep this movie relatively quiet.  Maybe he was too busy with the new Star Wars film.  In any case, the mention of Cloverfield in the title is certainly no coincidence.  While there is no direct connection to the original Cloverfield movie of 2008, there is certainly a familial relationship, if geographically distant.  Think about The Walking Dead and its spin-off, Fear the Walking Dead for example.  Or the Alien franchise and 2012s Prometheus.  In any case, surprise is important here so I will do my best to not give away anything critical beyond what is being shown in the trailers.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead (The Thing) plays Michelle, whose troubled marriage leads her to pack and leave her husband.  On her way to who-knows-where, she is involved in an accident and is left unconscious.  When she awakens she finds herself tethered to an IV and her damaged leg shackled to a wall.  A good Samaritan/captor named Howard (John Goodman, Argo) is also her nurse.  In the room next door is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr., Short Term 12) whose arm is in a sling but appears to know Howard pretty well.  As Howard explains, Michelle was rescued from her car and brought to his underground bunker just in time as there has been some kind of invasion.  Probably involving chemical or nuclear weapons.  He suspects the Russkies or Martians.  So is Howard evil or crazy, or a little of both?  And what is Emmett connection in all of this?

First time director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job keeping the audience guessing for the first 2 acts with the trio becoming more like a family as Howard hopes, but like most families, they have their tiffs.  And when Howard becomes upset, wellyou don't want to get him upset.  Goodman is terrific in the role.  Forget the teddy-bear-like character he often plays.  Here he has a wide range of emotions, sometimes seen all at once.  The third act belongs to Winstead.  Michelle, who has a long history of running away from confrontations and problems must go into survival mode.

While some of the scientific aspects of the underground bunker seem a little suspect, that is a small nit to pick.  The movie is frightening, filled with tension and legitimate terror.  The best movie I've seen so far this year.  Highly recommended.",1457740800,44,2351,4.764267990074441
7663878,3,B01BLH8R50,"The film has its moments of suspense, and the acting is great, but I feel like there are just too many plot holes. I won't give any spoilers away, but when you watch the film, a few things that are supposed to be a major part of the film went unexplained, and we never get the answers to the questions that were put out for us to ask. It is worth a watch for its story and I would recommend it even though it may leave some scratching their heads.",1457740800,,447,3.977777777777778
7663879,5,B01BLH8R50,"First off, this movie is hardly a sequel or a prequel to 2008's Cloverfield. Maybe in some way, it's a spin-off. Only time will tell. 95% of the movie is its own thing. It's during the last ten minutes where it might come close to being related to the first movie. This review might contain some spoilers. I've heard that this film was originally known as The Cellar. At the last minute, the producers tweaked a few things to try and make it related to Cloverfield. The story itself was actually very good and very intriguing. When I saw the trailers, I didn't know what to expect. It's very driven by suspense, almost like that of a Hitchcock film. It's kind of a mix between Saw, Misery, and a film called Otis. John Goodman's character is scary at times. You never know when he's going to crack.

Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Live Free or Die Hard) stars as Michelle, a woman on the run from her broken relationship. During a car crash, she wakes up in Howard's underground bunker, chained to the wall. Howard tells her he saved her life and claims that the world outside is now uninhabitable due to the nuclear or chemical fallout from ""an attack."" (One thing I loved was that we never knew until the end if Howard was telling the truth, or making up crazy stories just to keep Michelle and another man, Emmett captive for himself.) Michelle tries to escape but soon learns that monsters come in many forms. I like that it was isolated and claustrophobic and mostly kept in one location as the three main stars bond, play games, listen to music and watch TV. In a weird way it reminded me of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead when the four friends were confined to the mall. At first, I was thrown off and let down by the twist in the last half, but my friend gave me his explanation and it make a little more sense. The film as a whole is definitely starting to grow on me. As I said, the movie is very driven by great suspense and some decent character development. It's like a great suspense classic from the 70's, but made for modern times with a decent science fiction twist. I would definitely recommend 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE!!!",1457740800,5,2152,4.461928934010152

8750505,2,B01BLH8R50,"*SPOILERS AHEAD* -- Read at your own risk.

I wanted to like this movie, but like all J.J. romps, this story is unsatisfying. While we could have been outside having a merry ole romp kicking some alien butt, instead, we're stuck in a bunker with a crazed serial killer who has some kind of messiah complex. Instead of an action movie with guns a blazing, we're stuck with an incredibly slow paced failed suspense tale of a serial killer trying to survive with his prey and whom he will eventually kill.

The conversation between the characters is always awkward and cringe inducing, but not necessarily because the scene calls for it. The cast also has zero chemistry together. John Goodman's subdued demeanor is the only thing good about this film. His demeanor definitely intensifies his character's creepiness. But, that's where the character goodness ends. The rest is tedium as we watch boring bunker scene after boring bunker scene. Let's not even get into how ludicrous this bunker is designed. Why would you not only create a separate room accessible via a tiny ventilation shaft or via a separate outside entrance, but also stock that room with containers of food? Worse, why would you place the ventilation electrical system in this room? That would mean you're always required to leave the bunker, go outside and then back into this separate room to restart the ventilation system? What an unrealistic concept. If you're building a bunker for long term survival, you'd design it all inside the main complex including an electrical room.

Overall, this movie is mostly a waste of time. I didn't find the serial killer bunker scenes in any way suspenseful. At best, the scenes were laughable. At worst, they were intensely boring. The best part of this film's story, and that's not saying much actually, is when she finally escapes the bunker and understands what the world is up against. That moment should have come far sooner than it did. If it had come about 1/4 of the way through, perhaps we could have seen her get to Houston and kick some alien butt instead of spending 90% of the film being bored to tears watching her attempt and fail to escape the bunker multiple times. Once outside, this girl has all the grace of a bull in a china shop. Seriously, could she have made any more noise?",1532995200,,2306,4.76
