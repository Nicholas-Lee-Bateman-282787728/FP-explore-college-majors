It is dubbed so if your looking for subbed then this isn't your choice, animefreak.tv is. they do have the other version.
Now down to the show.
First half is all light and banter setting up the series for the last half, and you will know when that changes.
This series has no others like it that i know of.
it makes me laugh, blush, root for one girl then the next for rins affection, your emotions will rise and fall with this series. and you will find yourself holding a hankie to fight back the tears in several episodes. ( mostly the last half of the series )
If you like that type then yes buy this series. i have re watched this series so much that if it was a DVD i would have to buy new copies cause i have watched it so much.

3053470,5,B0010X8NKK,This anime series is fun and a great way to end your day with a laugh. I really enjoyed the characters they are all different and have their own story. I like how they covered each one and got you attached to every one of them. How can Rin choose one girl out of the five who love and adore him!? Watch and find out for yourself!

3053471,5,B0010X8NKK,"This is a great series.  Only one negative: It's dubbed.

I was watching the subtitled version on Hulu, and clicked the link to download the series.  Since I was watching a subbed version of the anime, I assumed what I was getting was also subtitled, not dubbed.  Personally, I cannot stand dubs, so I feel like I was duped.

Anyway, if you like dubbed anime, particularly the romantic-type a.k.a. ""Love Hina"", then this is a good one for you.",1305244800,,443,4.556962025316456
3053472,3,B0010X8NKK,"The beginning episodes are very goofy and light hearted. They are meant to be fun and believe me far from reality. This is an anime when girls actually fall for the ""nice guy"" and as we all know ""nice guys"" are not the type of men that women chase after. The main character Rin is as nice as they come, and for the most part is lacks qualities that most women would find attactive. He is indecisive,cowardly, easily manipulated, affraid of hurting others feelings so he alows himself to get manipulated. He is too sensitive, He doesn't stick up for himself, and is always apologizing for everything that upsets anyone. He is ideally what women do not want. However, in this Anime this nice guy ""Rin"" finished first. He has his pick of the litter and just about every girl wants him.

 The anime really plays around with this concept and for the most part is is very entertaining. Sometime however it is a bit disgusting. Especially with the Primula character who is supposed to be a young girl, but most of the time is placed at the center of sex jokes, which really is kind of disturbing considering she really is an innocent childlike character in the Anime. I didn't really find those parts funny or sexy...mostly just strange and made me question if I wanted to see the other episodes. One I saw that the first Volume was just fun and games, I was in for a shocker when I got deeper into the anime. You get to take a closer look into the lives of the girls and get to see that Beauty is only skin deep and not everything is what is seems. Each of the girls have their skeletons, and we get a chance to meet them all.

 This part of the Anime is what made it very real and extremely realistic, no matter how over the top the Anime was at times. In earlier episodes we watch these beautiful girls fight over Rin but then we get to see each of their real flaws,and who they truly were. We learn that some of them have serious problems from low selfesteem, to regret, to shame, to the downright phsychotic. Just like in real life dating and meeting women, no matter how beatiful they are, they all have their problems. Things aren't always as they seem, and this pretty much is the same note the rest of the series takes off on. I liked watching the anime, but like I said I wouldn't break my neck to watch it. The character of Rin, and his uncanny ability to attract so many females with his many flaws just always seemed like a downer to this Anime. Had he been designed as a more believable character with traits that you could imagine in the slightest bit seeing women being attracted to this anime may have been better, but it just didn't hit it off for me.",1236470400,,2662,4.339357429718875
3053473,4,B0010X8NKK,"Despite two very weak lead characters, a supporting cast filled with charming characters keeps this series interesting. While harem series are generally predictable in nature, this series has inserted enough humor and twists into the first four episodes to keep me very interested in seeing more. Very recommended.",1223424000,,314,5.5625
3053474,4,B0010X8NKK,"If you are relatively new to anime and appreciate what are termed school harem shows, you will enjoy Shuffle!, as it is one of the best of this genre to come along in years.  On the other hand, if you are an anime veteran (years of avid fandom), you might see this story as cliche and formulaic, since many of the individual setups and gags have been done before.  However, I would suggest Shuffle! to any fan of harem or school drama for the aspects that are unique as well as it being a well-told story.

Seasoned harem fans will compare it to Love Hina and Girls Bravo, and a long list of Urusei Yatsura and Tenchi imitators, but Shuffle!'s early comedic focus serves primarily to endear you to the characters and provide lighthearted, if stock, entertainment.  This mood won't last, however, as it begins to resemble more straight school dramas like Da Capo, To Heart, Canvas and more recently Clannad.  In fact, Shuffle! veers further toward melodrama than would seem appropriate given its initial chapters, but along with its fantasy/sci-fi elements, thus provides a deeper experience.

Shuffle!, along with most modern harem anime series, is an adaptation of  text-based games called visual novels in Japan, the most popular type being dating simulation games (Shuffle! was the second highest-selling computer game for the second half of January 2004 in Japan).  The player is more or less surrounded by beautiful girls matching various standard character types and works toward developing a romantic relationship with each one of the characters in turn.  These game adaptations are definitely hit-and-miss, since most of the self-paced games provide little to the animation producer beyond characters and story concepts.  Note that the lead character, the male protagonist, must always be an original creation since in the game this is the player, who obviously is not one of the characters.  Fortunately, Shuffle! was directed by Naoto Hosoda, a veteran of Boogiepop Phantom, R.O.D. the TV, Utawarerumono, DearS and several other highly successful anime series.

But Shuffle exceeds those low expectations and becomes a worthy series that stands on its own.  The creators rapidly set the stage, drawing the viewer into its somewhat zany universe of humans, demons and gods without wasting time.  The pacing and editing are excellent, the music and sound are superior to most such series, and the animation is on par with all but the highest quality anime.  While hardcore anime fans will recognize similarities to well-worn character archetypes amongst the girls, each is written with sufficient depth to make them unique, interesting and attractive to all but the most jaded viewer.  The plot is continually engaging, and the characters all change and grow in often dramatic and unpredicted ways.

Maybe most significantly for genre fans, Rin Tsuchimi, the male protagonist is a well-written, complex character deserving of the attention garnered from the girls; far different from the wimpy, irritatingly clueless and introverted male leads typical of standard harem shows (think the absolute opposite of Yukinari in Girls Bravo).

If you like harem series, Shuffle! is one of those worth buying, because you will watch it more than once in the coming years.  Out of the 100 or so new animated TV series produced every year in Japan, generally only 5 or 6 merit the cost of purchase on DVD in the U.S. by non-collectors, though many more are licensed and released here.  For the hardcore harem fan, Shuffle! is a required purchase.  For the casual anime fan, especially new fans looking to expand their library with quality titles that represent good animated story-telling in the context of modern Japanese culture, Shuffle! is certainly worth the investment.",1221091200,,3771,5.1190864600326265
3053475,5,B0010X8NKK,"To be honest, I was quite worried about watching Shuffle! again for the first time in almost three years. If you're not already aware, I have something of an adamant fanaticism towards the franchise, but since the show's conclusion back in early 2006, my passion for it has been kept alive through buying merch of questionable taste, playing the games with little knowledge of Japanese, and generally fanboying over it. Shuffle! Memories, a short recap of the show which aired in 2007 brought it all back to me in digest form, but I actually stopped watching that because I wasn't a fan of how it was cut together. That, and I also called into question whether or not I still liked the series. Thankfully, upon completing this first disc, I can gladly say this show is just as wonderful as a I remember it being.

Story is, Rin Tsuchimi is the object of many a girl's affection. His adoring childhood friend Kaede pampers him daily; his senior Asa teases him lovingly at every turn; the princesses of the World of Gods and World of Demons, Sia and Nerine, want to be his bride and a certain deadpan loli called Primula is inexplicably attached to him. In other words, he has quite the harem on his hands. These early episodes focus on introducing the cast, the world in which they inhabit and then they get started on fleshing out each girl one-by-one come episode three. It's pretty standard harem/bishoujo game adaptation fare, but its beauty lies in the execution.

I have nothing against the harem formula, but at the same time I don't really seek it out as a means of entertainment. In fact, what grabbed me about Shuffle! initially was the character designs. Luckily there was far more to it than that. The show simply hits me in all the right places. I like it when things are over-the-top and celebrate what they are almost shamelessly. In the same way that Giant Robo loves being a crazy, overdone, epic adventure story, Shuffle! loves being a moe moe harem show. All the girls are adorable and well dressed, they all have cute voices, and they are ALL deredere to some extent. But beyond that, the show delivers entertainment in the form of decently done character interaction and heaping helpings of quirky humour. What will really help you get into this show is if you find a character to latch onto, since in these early episodes, each of the girls gets roughly equal amounts of screentime. Kaede's my personal preference.

The animation for Shuffle! is handled by newcomer studio asread, who had only previously done various inbetweening jobs for a number of a studios. Their work here is extremely well done, but in a few cuts you can see that they're green behind the ears. There's also something of a consistency issue between episodes, but for the most part the show looks good. All the girls' designs are converted from the game's two art styles to anime's singular style very well and they all look extremely beautiful. The soundtrack is typical eroge-sounding stuff which does the job, and the opening and ending songs along with their respective animations are some of my favourites. The voice cast is brilliant, with some notables being Yuuko Gotou as Kaede, Sayaka Aoki as Sia and hitomi as Primula. Gotou especially just does a wonderful job at sounding like a loving and caring young girl that I simply melt into goo. GOO! Didn't watch the dub.

FUNimation's DVD release is mostly competent, with some minor issues here and there. The biggest mistake in this release was having KyoAni's name show up in the opening logos for the DVD, since they did nothing at all. The sequence of logos seemed similar to that of the Haruhi DVDs, so I suspect Kadokawa sent them that and neglected to remove the KyoAni logo. That little snafu aside, the subs on this DVD seem mostly okay, but there was a noticeable number of instances where phrases like ""it is"" and ""they are"" could have been contracted for the sake of flow, but besides that I found nothing wrong. The video quality seems good enough, though it sadly only feels like a slight step up from the TV raws I watched, but I suppose that's more an issue with the animation than anything else. The menus are well designed and easy to navigate, and the extras are pretty sparse- textless opening and ending plus a small fold-out poster.

Shuffle! is not for everyone. It's a harem show, pure and simple, but one that's extremely well done and caters more towards guys with a deredere leaning. To me it's actually something of a healing show, at least in these opening episodes- watching it just feels so calming and relaxing. So basically it's like Aria for men even lonelier than the men watching Aria! At least at the moment, things'll heat up come DVD number 4!

3053477,5,B0010X8NKK,"Rin Tsuchime is a guy with a very interesting problem, he has to choose between five beautiful girls who are all trying to win his affection, and three of them arn't even human. Shuffle is a very entertaining harem series that kept me wanting more from the very first episode. It can be hilerioius and serious at the same time, especially once you add the crazy antics of the girl's fathers into the mix. over all Shuffle! is a very entertaining series and is definatly worth watching.",1206144000,,485,4.586206896551724

3053489,5,B0010X8NKK,"It has been over 10 years since the gates to the heavens and the underworld has opened.  Now it is not uncommon to see humans, gods (human like with elven ears), and demons (human like with ears like Ryoko of Tenchi fame) living, working, and going to school together.  Ren is your typical high school boy with an unusual problem, he lives with the schools most beautiful and intelligent girl (Kaede) because his parents and her mom died in an accident and the other guys are very jealous forming the Knights for Kissing Kaede, or the KKK (no relation to the other version).  Then two new girls are transferred to the school, Sia and Rin.  Sia is a god and Rin is a demon and both of their fathers are the Kings of their respected realms.  And both are in love with Ren, which of course makes the rest of the male population even MORE upset.  Throw in Aya, another human who has known Ren as long as Kaede and Padoma, a demon girl who is attached to Rin and therefore also attached to Ren, and his best friend who is a bit of a womanizer and you have the main cast of characters.  So you have one guy, five girls, and a couple of ultra powerful fathers, and one very difficult choice you get a very entertaining storyline....WHO WOULD YOU PICK????

This disk was entertaining from the get go.  The dubbing is great and story gets you hooked right from the start.  Watching the fathers get out of trouble with the teacher in episode one and four is great and seeing Sia club her father when he gets out of hand is worth watching.  see you next disk",1203984000,,1547,4.318339100346021

3287986,5,B0010X8NKK,"It has been over 10 years since the gates to the heavens and the underworld has opened.  Now it is not uncommon to see humans, gods (human like with elven ears), and demons (human like with ears like Ryoko of Tenchi fame) living, working, and going to school together.  Ren is your typical high school boy with an unusual problem, he lives with the schools most beautiful and intelligent girl (Kaede) because his parents and her mom died in an accident and the other guys are very jealous forming the Knights for Kissing Kaede, or the KKK (no relation to the other version).  Then two new girls are transferred to the school, Sia and Rin.  Sia is a god and Rin is a demon and both of their fathers are the Kings of their respected realms.  And both are in love with Ren, which of course makes the rest of the male population even MORE upset.  Throw in Aya, another human who has known Ren as long as Kaede and Padoma, a demon girl who is attached to Rin and therefore also attached to Ren, and his best friend who is a bit of a womanizer and you have the main cast of characters.  So you have one guy, five girls, and a couple of ultra powerful fathers, and one very difficult choice you get a very entertaining storyline....WHO WOULD YOU PICK????

This disk was entertaining from the get go.  The dubbing is great and story gets you hooked right from the start.  Watching the fathers get out of trouble with the teacher in episode one and four is great and seeing Sia club her father when he gets out of hand is worth watching.  see you next disk",1203984000,,1547,4.318339100346021

8239063,3,B0010X8NKK,"This anime started off well, well-drawn with an interesting story line, but, as many animes do, it took a dark turn about 60% of the way through.  I'm not looking for ""dark matter"" - i.e., soap opera or deep emotional stories - in my anime; I'm looking for light entertainment, ala Rosario + Vampire or High School DxD.  It's unlikely I'll watch this one again.",1463184000,,361,4.538461538461538

It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry.

After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1354924800,,920,4.317919075144508
