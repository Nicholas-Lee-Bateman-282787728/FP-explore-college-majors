2408761,5,B000B8IAJ4,"Hey, let's be honest here.  Andy Sidaris is not a master filmmaker.  But the guy does really care about his films if you listen to the commentary.  Sure, there's a lot of unintentional humor and the intentional humor is groaningly not-funny.  The stories are silly, the characterizations broad, and the action mostly a bunch of choppy explosion.

But these films are rarely boring.  As a diehard Andy Sidaris fan, I love these gems of low-budget cinema.  They make me laugh, make me wonder, and just amuse me.  It doesn't hurt that Andy has apparently never heard the term ""Gratituous Nudity"" because there's a lot of it in here.

And that's a good thing.",1144281600,7,655,4.725663716814159
2408762,4,B000B8IAJ4,"It's been a long wait till these movies were available again. The box set is a great idea. These are fun movies that also throw in a helping flash of flesh from some very pretty girls. If your looking for some not so serious good guy vrs. bad guy movies, (James Bond they aren't) and your old enough to watch then these are for you. Any of the Andy Sadaris collectors sets are a good choice, and will probably have you coming back for more. Enjoy.",1142726400,6,447,4.209302325581396
2408763,5,B000B8IAJ4,"andy sidaris was a cameraman for a.b.c. sports who on his time off would make the best drive-in movies in the world. no deep meaning, just action and some of the hotest women on the planet. malibu express his first is also the least of these films. but hard ticket to hawaii,and fit to kill fall into his james bond style of action and hot girls. like i said no deep meaning but great action and girls. not for the kids but for the kids who never grew up. enjoy this great set (HEE-HEE)!!!!",1135987200,4,490,4.223404255319149
8083510,5,B000B8IAJ4,"These movies aren't great on their own, but if you're looking for some flashy T&A with humor mixed in, these are five star in that category.

Malibu Express, in particular, is hilarious. The star of Malibu Express, Darby Hinton, was the little boy who played the son of Daniel Boone in the 60s TV series with Fess Parker. Quite by accident, I happen to know the writer of one of the songs used in the movie: ""I'm in Love with the Girl in the Centerfold"". He had the song on file, and the guys who made the movie picked it out and used it. When he mentioned it at dinner one night, I exclaimed ""I've seen that movie!"". Which was funny, because he'd never seen the movie. LOL

Sidaris was well known for throwing both T&A and a bunch of ""toys"" --- mostly in the form of vehicles -- into his films. This package used to be a bargain when I bought it years ago for $12.",1490400000,,865,4.173652694610778

8083516,1,B000B8IAJ4,garbage. This was one of the worst movies ever made. Characters are not realistic and filmmaking was really poorly doney,1355875200,,120,5.05
8083517,3,B000B8IAJ4,"I doubt anyone connected with an Andy Sidaris film ever rented a tux for the Oscars, but that's not the point. The point is to enter a fantasy world, no closer to reality than Star Wars or Blade Runner. These movies are supposed to be fun. Get some popcorn, turn off the cell, put out the cat and enjoy. Even better if you can open the windows on a sumer night and make out with your sweetie as you watch.",1235347200,2,405,4.075

8083519,5,B000B8IAJ4,"Andy Sidaris' drive-in movies of the 1980's and 1990's are, I have to admit, a favorite guilty pleasure of mine.  You wouldn't show them at the AFI annual banquet, but while they may be trash, they're entertaining trash put together by a guy who cares about having fun.  This set (one of three) contains ""Hard Ticket to Hawaii"", ""Fit to Kill"", and the first Sidaris movie I ever saw, ""Malibu Express"", with shapely blonde B-movie queen Sybil Danning.  These films, and the others in the series, are all classics - using the word advisedly :) - of the ""girls with guns"" genre.  Not safe for work, it goes without saying, but get yourself a six-pack and break out the popcorn!",1186790400,6,674,4.591666666666667
