8765508,5,B01HI87P4K,"Another upbeat crime tale by Sacha Bennett who also wrote himself a small role. The ""not quite over the hill gang"" lead by Richie Archer (Ian Ogilvie) gets caught performing an old fashion bank heist...deliberately. Their plan is to go to prison and spring George (Patrick Bergin) so he can visit his dying wife. Rival Vic Farrow (Billy Murray) ""He's not the devil, but he comes a close second"" throws a wrench into the works.

This production smartly moves between a crime drama and a prison drama with the right amount of humor mixed into the dialogue. Julian Glover has a minor role as compared to his billing. Not to give too much away, but the film sets up for a better sequel. I loved the scene when they all have on reading glasses attempting to make out the color of an alarm wire.
