7828102,5,6302617693,"I was happily astonished to see ""This Child is Mine"" on tape, and I urge someone to make and sell a DVD of this splendid television movie I saw when it came out in the 1980s. Since only one buyer will have the pleasure of buying the tape, I will give spoilers, though some of the details may come from my faulty memories.

Kathleen York, a splendid actress, plays a young girl, pregnant, on drugs, and with a boyfriend not ready to marry her. Lindsay Wagner is the married woman who adopts the little girl. Wagner overacts wildly, possibly on purpose, giving a frenetic, hysterical picture of a woman pretending to be a mother. Everything about the child has to be photographed, as if to make it real, so it seems as if we are seeing a movie within a movie. For example, what the child will be named becomes more important than the fate of the Titanic.

The biological mother gets off drugs, the boyfriend becomes ready to marry her, and York petitions the judge to give her back her child. Wagner  outdoes her usual overacting in her soap-opera plea to the judge for her rights as a ""mother,"" but the judge gives the child to her biological mother. After all the histrionics, the movie ends with a quiet scene. The little girl, not yet walking, is on the floor of an empty room. Kathleen York walks in, sees her, then gets down on the floor with her and says, very gently, ""Hello, Baby.""

Hankies are necessary at this point!",1482624000,,1426,4.452107279693487

7828104,5,6302617693,"I watched this movie in awe! imagine having your dream of being a mother fulfilled only to be snatched away because the birth mother changes her mind? This birth mother waited til after this infant was almost six months old to ""decide "" if she was ready to be a Mom. I feel that if you wanted your child you would never have given her up in the first place. The adopted parents had their hearts ripped out ,not to mention the upset to this child who had two loving parents that she grew to love and need. if you want to see a emotional and great movie this is it!",1172361600,5,563,4.081081081081081
