8241902,5,B0011MS3LY,"An under the radar concert that has some incredible moments, Skip the Roger Mcguinn and Richard Thompson songs and then the good stuff starts, Les Paul and his band have a special chemistry and you feel it in the sincerity of his playing, Robbie Robertson gets the show amped up and Roger Watters and Snowy White bring it on with an incredible performance, the second part of the concert has the usaul guitar showmanship from Satriani, Vai and Brian May, Joe Walsh is his usual jam session style from the 70s and Paul Rodgers ""All Right Now"" is just a going thrue the motions interpretation as bland as Paul Rodgers has become, ""Hey Joe"" is guitar hero's run amuck. Cozy Powell , Rick Wakeman, Neil Murray,and Nathan East are some of the backing musicians, If you enjoy concert dvds this is a keeper.",1395964800,,800,4.601398601398602
