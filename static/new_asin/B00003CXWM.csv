1295916,5,B00003CXWM,"Hi, I loved this movie! My favorite part is when john lennon song plays and Jason Lee made a room full of stars for JLH character. I liked the way Jason Lees character was so tender and gentle with JLH. I also liked that the women in the movie grew and became better people. The humor in the movie was great. It warmed my heart to see this film.",989625600,2,345,4.0144927536231885
1295917,5,B00003CXWM,"Jennifer Love Hewitt looks so hot she makes Marilyn Monroe seem ugly.  In this movie she exemplifies a perfect body, face, and personality to become an ideal seductress.  She plays a Siren that could lure any man away from his wife.  She is better than any wife or woman that I've ever seen.  One scene from the previews that is missing, is when she is on the treadmill.  And that's a dang shame.  I beg someone to please include it on the extras.  Also there is a scene where she is limping near a pool, but she never injured herself.  Perhaps there's a connection.  Ray Liota is excellent, Gene Hackman is alright, and Sigorny Weaver is getting old.  Include a Director's cut to complete this movie.",987724800,,701,4.492063492063492
1295918,3,B00003CXWM,"Most way through ""Heartbreakers"" it wants you to believe to that love sucks, life is a pain, men cheat, and the best things in life AREN'T free. And the odd thing is most of what is says is true lol. But, beneath the icy, cold exterior of ""Heartbreaker"" lies a movie that has a lot of heart and is actually old-fashion in it's values. This is of course despite the fact that there's a scene where Jennifer Love Hewitt tries to give Ray Liotta fellatio. The movie, many know by now is about a mother\daughter con team the marries rich men and then goes after half of their money in a divorce settlement whenever the ""sucker"" is caught fooling around with Page Conners (Jennifer Love Hewitt). As the movie starts we see Max Conners (Sigourney Weaver) walking down the aisle about to marry her 13th husband we are told Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta). After they get what they want out of Dean they decide it's time to move to Palm Beach, where they feel the stakes are higher. After getting a room for free, they go out to check out a long line of ""victims"". They decide upon William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman). A very wealthy tobacconist. Now, while Weaver is trying to win over Hackman, Hewitt is going after Jack Withrowe (Jason Lee). The only problem is instead of just trying to con him she finds herself falling for him. Now, between all of this there are a lot of laughs to be had. And, incase you were wondering, no, I'm not going to reveal any of them. It's at the end of ""Heartbreakers"" I found that I had enjoyed the movie. It's at this point of the film that it becomes an old fashion comedy. And, that's what I liked about this film. I thought it was a cute movie, and characters were fun to watch. ""Heartbreakers"" is not a great comedy. It's not one of the best films I've seen this year. But, if your looking for some simple lite entertainment that will provide some laughs, and keep you interested, I think you found your picture.
 p.s- spot Anne Bancroft in three scenes. She doesn't have a ""major"" character, but, her part makes for some big changes at the end.",987379200,7,2068,4.399477806788512
1295919,3,B00003CXWM,"A movie that proves that what you see is not necessarily what you get, as a mother/daughter team con one well-heeled member of the opposite sex after another, in ""Heartbreakers,"" directed by David Mirkin and starring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Yes, the con is on, as mom takes `em to the altar, daughter seduces `em (getting caught in the act by mom, of course), and mom settles for a divorce and some big bucks.  For the women, it's like having the goose that laid the golden egg, and all is going well; the bucks are rolling in and Cupid's path is being littered in their wake with the carnage of the men they've despoiled.  Then Page (Hewitt), much to the chagrin of her mother, Angela (Weaver), decides it's time to strike out on her own and take down a score for herself.  But as fate, luck, chance or what-have-you would have it, at that moment the IRA steps in and not only wipes out their bank account, but hands them a bill for back taxes that far and away exceeds the amount already confiscated.  At that point, what's a girl to do, but find another mark.  Only this time, it has to be one rich beyond their wildest dreams.  And with that, the hunt is on.
 An amusing, and at times hilarious comedy, the fact that it works as well as it does can be attributed to two things, by category:  Weaver and Hewitt; and Ray Liotta and Jason Lee.  For what the movie lacks in originality is made up for with the performances of the aforementioned four.  As far as the women, such a pair of femmes fatales you've never seen; Hewitt has it and flaunts it, but she's still overshadowed by the gorgeous Weaver.  Looks aside, however, what really makes it cook is their shared if-you-see-me-comin'-better-step-aside, take-no-prisoners attitude, a Mae West meets Kate Hepburn persona that gives their con its zing.  Weaver plays it to the hilts, saucy, seductive and sharp as a tack.  And not to be outdone by her co-star, Hewitt stays right there with her, by giving a performance that makes you believe that this is a young woman who could actually pull this stuff off.  Together, their antics on screen are reminiscent of Lemmon and Curtis in ""Some Like It Hot,"" or Caine and Martin in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.""  There's a refreshing lack of pretentiousness about them that really makes them fun to watch.
 As for the guys, Liotta gives a sharp performance as Dean, a guy with a hard edge and a soft spot for Angela, and Lee does a notable turn as Jack, a regular guy who finds himself in the eye of Angela and Page's storm.  Lee has an especially engaging screen presence, and some of the most memorable moments of the film are in the scenes he shares with Hewitt.
 Last, but far from least, Gene Hackman scores some guffaws as billionaire tobacco magnate William Tensy.  He gets a bit tongue-in-cheek with his character, who with his tobacco stained teeth and smoker's cough is at the same time hilarious and repulsive.  When Angela demurs his attempted kiss, you'd swear you can smell his breath and the reek of smoke from his clothes.  And you have to give Hackman credit for this one, because to play this role all vanity had to be stuffed in the closet for the duration.
 The supporting cast includes Anne Bancroft (Barbara), Jeffrey Jones (Mr. Appel), Nora Dunn (Miss Madress), Julio Oscar Mechoso (Leo), Carrie Fisher (Mrs. Surpin), Ricky Jay (Dawson's Auctioneer) and Elya Baskin (Vladimir).  Director Mirkin must be given credit for his imaginative approach to some fairly unoriginal material, and for making up for it's lack of substance by extracting some top performances from his actors.  The real strength of ""Heartbreakers,"" however, is the fact that it never takes itself too seriously.  If you look deep enough, you may find some insight into human nature, but for the most part this is a movie that was made with nothing but fun in mind.  It's entertaining, there's some laughs and some nice moments, and it's easy on the eyes.  If you let it, it's a movie that will let you off the hook for awhile and show you a good time.  And for my money, that's not such a bad deal.",987379200,7,4106,4.601648351648351
1295920,2,B00003CXWM,"I just saw this movie in theatres. Hopefully the review will help people when the DVD comes out.  This movie is a disappointment, big time. You know a movie is a disappointment when the plot cannot keep you interested and you start to notice how the minute things are so awful.  The plot is mother and daughter (Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt) con well-to-do men into marriage, fake seductions, then quick divorces.  Weaver tries to seduce Gene Hackman, and Hewitt tries to con a guy that she actually falls in love with.  Mayhem soon follows.  Here is why the movie doesn't work: if Weaver is the con genius that she is, why doesn't she research Russian language and culture before pretending to be Russian?  The only word she can correctly use is ""Da"" (Yes). While flirting with Hackman, she calls him a babooshka (Grandmother).  He obviously, since movies always work this way, takes her to a Russian restaurant, when she can't speak the language and avoids disaster only by singing (in English) a version of the Beatles' ""Back in the USSR"" that makes you grind your teeth. Another thing:  do the people involved with the movie honestly think men are that stupid?  Ray Liotta's character is still in love with Weaver, after she wrongs him, because he wants basically to sleep with her. Hewitt treats a man like dirt, but she all of a sudden pretends to like him, and he instantly falls in love, for no reason than apparently her cleavage. The whole point of the movie seems to be some feminist ideal that all men are hormone-crazy pigs that will do anything for sex, a point they try to prove by having Weaver and Hewitt dress one step better than hookers and use their wardrobe in heavy advertising to try and lure men in to watch. (The reason I saw the movie in theatres is because I was with a group of friends - both guys and gals -  that wanted to go see it.)  The third thing that bothers me is the treatment of the tobacco industry.  Yes, cigarettes kill, but people who smoke know what the risks are and are dumb enough to do it anyway, thereby deserving what happens to them. Hackman is portrayed as a disgusting old man because he is a tobacco tycoon. He talks of doing tests on children, kills his pet by second-hand smoke etc.  Ok, the director does not like smoking. We get the point. I spent half the movie thinking the director must be getting a little money from the government for helping their lawsuit-happy anti-tobacco ways. Additionally, the inter-character relationships work out the same way as a dull tv drama does; the over-protective mother, the daughter that treats her mother like dirt because she wrongly feels unloved, etc. To sum it up, Hackman and Weaver give the best performance they can given the script, Hewitt runs around angrily, and Liotta plays a role too silly to watch. The man is just too good of an actor to play the character he plays. This is one that maybe would be worth the two dollars to rent, since the humor is pretty light-hearted, but it is not worth the twenty to thirty dollars that the DVD will run when it comes out.",987292800,,3088,4.562386980108499

1296096,4,B00003CXWM,"Suitable that a story about con artist ""HeartBreakers"" would begin with a felony tax evading religionist slave mongering ceremony styled as ""marriage"" which in 57% of all perpetrations leads inevitably to felony theft divorce racketeering in an average of three years (just long enough for the thieving ""wife"" to have fully evaluated what there is to steal with the help of the felony religionist ""court"" system).  Overnight for an unconsumated mirage was a bit brief even for that intentional felony theft fraud system.

But this and You Again I think are her best roles.  And what can you say about Jennifer Love Hewittt.  Dang.  Gene Hackman plays one of their targets.  He's kind of a sleezy old man who looks like he's going to fall over dead any second.  And it turns out that Sigourney Weaver is too much for him.  And while all this is going on she is trying to stay ahead of Ray Liotta who knows shat she is doing.  And Jennifer really does fall for Jason Lee.

This is Jennifer's best role! She has great comedic skills & when the script calls for more serious acting she nails that too. Ghost Whisperer was pretty successful in it's tv run but this is the role Jennifer truly excelled at. She looks incredible in all of her scenes! The wardrobe dept. definitely accentuated her beauty pageant queen looks & best assets. E.G. - As a said before her amazing chest!

1296512,4,B00003CXWM,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I remember this movie coming out years ago. I remember watching it. I remember thinking it had some truly hilarious moments in it. So why did it take it coming out of blu-ray from Olive for me to remember all of that?

Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt star as Max and Page Connors, a mother-daughter con team. While Weaver lures men into marriage Hewitt teases them into almost cheating with her before mom walks in to find them and then divorce her new husband, taking a hefty sum with her. Their latest victim is Dean Cummano (Ray Liotta), a low level mobster who truly is in love with Weaver.

As the duo head out to find their next mark, Page continues to badger her mother about taking on a mark all her own. But mom still doesnt think Page is ready to do so and they bicker about it back and forth. While searching for their new mark Max sets her eyes on William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a wealthy tobacco company owner. Page goes along to help, swearing this is their last time together on a job.

Then Page decides to set out on her own mark as well at the same time. Her target is Jack Withrowe, the owner of a beach bar and son of a wealthy man. Problems follow Page right away as she doesnt even target Jack thinking hes just a beach bum before discovering who he is. Unaware she truly is what her mother has said all along, not quite ready to take on marks alone.

But more problems follow Page. While trying to handle two marks at the same time she makes mistakes with both. Shes not where she should be when it comes to Tensy and falling in love with Jack rather than setting him up for the con. Leave it to mother to intervene. But then that goes wrong as well. Toss in Dean realizing how much he truly loves Max and coming to find her and the sparks and laughs are soon to follow.

 While the movie didn't make a big splash when it was released it did two things. First, it made a decent return on investment making some money. And secondly it provided a more adult role for the then early career of Hewitt, moving her away from the teen roles she had been used to and employing her buxom assets to move into a more adult category. It must have worked because she is still an actress today unlike a number of child stars who have faded into history.

As I said from the start, the movie is quite funny and more so than I recalled. All of the actors here play their parts to peak perfection but the one that stands out in my mind is Hackman. Known more for his dramatic roles his part here is rather small but quite memorable and hilarious. His tobacco magnate is constantly chain smoking cigarettes while coughing non-stop the entire time. Subtle uses of make-up also add to the humor in his character. While the rest of the cast is more involved with situational comedy and wordplay all Hackman has to do is walk into a scene to make me laugh.

Olive has done a great job with the transfer here as theyve done with a number of titles this past year. Its nice to know theres a company out there who has realized that not only the mega blockbuster films of yesteryear deserve to remain available in the best format possible. Hopefully theyll continue to do so for some time in the future.",1453334400,4,3268,4.292207792207792

1296543,4,B00003CXWM,Fantastic movie! In my opinion this is a movie that a lot of people like but for whatever reason they hate to admit it. Without a doubt this is Jennifer Love Hewitt at her finest and she absolutely shines in this movie. Her best acting can be seen on Ghost Whisperer but this is the next best thing. This movie has some drama but it is mainly a mix of love and humor but the humor is where Jennifer ails it. The visuals of the blu-ray are very crisp and colorful with some beautiful scenery. The audio is pretty good but a movie like this is not meant to be a sound effects gem anyways. I would have given it 5 stars if they would have included some extras or behind the scenes videos. Honestly this should be sold for $12.99 or less but fans of the movie can't go wrong either way!,1449273600,7,782,4.117647058823529

Actual locations provide the setting for Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver to seek their prey. Gene Hackman in one of the most ham-fisted roles he's ever had foisted on him.
But the tragedy is Jason Lee, playing a bar owner free spirit, shows the mettle to be the post-Affleck/McConnaughey romcom leading man who has enough macho to be believable, but also the sensitivity to deliver what women want.

1296925,5,B00003CXWM,"With the actors that play in this movie, you can't go wrong!  Of course, I am a true fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt!!!  She is by far one of the most beautiful ladies of her age & she doesn't do the cosmetic/plastic surgery like some of the other actresses.  She has taken criticism for being the lady she is; not a size 0-1 (THANK GOD)!!!

Between her & Sigourney Weaver, who also is incredibly beautiful/sexy in this movie, they work so well along side with Ray Liotta, Jason Lee, & the ""Iconic"" Gene Hackman make this movie a must watch!

It is a funny & slightly suspenseful love story.  But You can't take your eye off the two leading ladies, as they are so sexy!!  Sigourney Weaver is so talented going from Alien, with the shaved head look to the awesome sexy outfits any man would love to come home to see her in, she is just mind blowing!!

The men, Ray, Jason & Gene just do incredible job working with these 2 ladies,  I would love their job!!  But in the same breath, it must be difficult to work with them, as the outtakes I haven't seen!!",1403481600,,1049,4.252525252525253
1296926,4,B00003CXWM,Heart breakers is a good movie to watch. It's funny and comical and entertaining. I recommend this moving if you like comedies and just want something funny.,1402876800,,157,4.851851851851852

1296949,1,B00003CXWM,Didn't get past a few minutes.  Stupid. Hated the premise and where the situations were leading.  Not something you wanted to watch with anyone else either.,1401753600,,156,4.961538461538462
1296950,4,B00003CXWM,Definitely a girls movie. I enjoyed the fact that the actors were good and well known. I would watch this again.,1401667200,,112,4.380952380952381
1296951,3,B00003CXWM,"Sigourney Weaver isn't enough to make up for Jennifer Love Hewitt. They're grifters, mom and daughter. Daughter is tired of working with Mom and wants to do her own thing. But she's not very good. Actually, neither is mom. She gets taken by her own friend and the mark. Daughter falls in love with her mark. I couldn't stay awake for the end. Don't think I missed much.",1401494400,,369,4.4411764705882355
1296952,2,B00003CXWM,"Why did I watch the whole thing?  Movies that start off bad rarely get better, although this one did, just enough to keep me hoping.  Was it camp? Was it supposed to be funny?  Maybe.  I had a few laughs.  But how many unlikable characters can you stand in one movie?

And how could so many stars decide to be in a movie with such a terrible script?  The fellow who played opposite Weaver acted so woodenly that Weaver wasn't much more believable. The best part was the ending, which you begin to fear is going to tie things up with a bow and then satisfies a little by acknowledging the reality that people as selfish as Weaver and her spouse rarely change very much.

1296953,4,B00003CXWM,"Kind of silly, but as it progressed I got used to that level of zaniness and enjoyed the roles played by Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Gene Hackman et al.  It remains a light-hearted movie but it deserves a good rating (actually perhaps a 3-1/2 which isn't available) for a funny story line and good acting.",1401321600,,317,4.660714285714286
1296954,4,B00003CXWM,"Fun movie.

1296955,2,B00003CXWM,I think this movie is nothing more than drivel.  Another movie not to waste time on.  I'm glad I watched it through Amazon Prime because I'd be kicking myself for wasting money to own it.,1400630400,,187,4.314285714285714
1296956,3,B00003CXWM,"OK, but not as humorous as I had hoped. Too many of the same gags repeated on different characters.  Proabably should have actually used a comedian as one of the principles.",1400544000,,173,4.580645161290323
1296957,1,B00003CXWM,"I love this movie. It is lighthearted and funny! I wouldn't give the movie an oscar nor would I say that the acting is superb but it is the perfect movie if you want light hearted entertainment, or a quick laugh.",1400457600,,212,4.195121951219512

1297045,3,B00003CXWM,Funny and entertaining  though a little unbelievable. The actors all worked well together to make it a light comedy that was not slap stick. Good movie for the night you do not want to use your brain or cry your eyes out.,1399334400,,221,4.261904761904762

1297047,5,B00003CXWM,Great Movie. The roles of each of one of the characters was believable. The plotting was Somewhat predictable but still very entertaining nonetheless.,1399161600,,150,5.565217391304348
1297048,3,B00003CXWM,Entertaining. Good for younger crowd although some of the topics of decussion are slightly inappropriate. Good mystery keeps you guessing.,1399075200,,138,5.95

1297051,5,B00003CXWM,"Sigourney Weaver's comic talents were revealed to me in this movie. After thinking of her as Ridley in the Alien series for so long, it was great to see her in this role.  Gene Hackman is brilliant as the repulsive chain smoking millionaire and Jennifer Love Hewitt rounds out the cast as the not really evil daughter.  I highly recommend this enjoyable comedy.",1398729600,,361,4.714285714285714

How can you go wrong with Jennifer Love Hewlit? It was also fun to see ""Earl"" as one of the main characters. I do miss that show! Worth the time and I thought it was labeled incorrectly... It should be heartwarming! (Smile)",1398124800,,374,4.28169014084507

1297161,5,B00003CXWM,"I'm not a big fan of either leading lady, but they shine in this movie. The dialogue is crisp and funny, the sets are wonderful, the clothing glamorous, and the story is a fun romp that helps you escape - like Old Hollywood intended. No gore. Mild language. Light sexual innuendos. I kept expecting Cary Grant to saunter into a scene. I will watch it again. This isn't Oscar material. It's not intended to be! It just wants the audience to have a good time eating nachos (I hate popcorn) and laughing often. And the plot isn't all that predictable......",1396915200,,553,4.54

1297207,5,B00003CXWM,"The acting and lines and delivery were all well done. One of the funnier movies I've seen. Racy humor with a bit of high school antics, but it all dovetails well. This moved along nicely with a steady pace of comedy and very few dry spells. Lots of great characters. Hackman and Liota were at their best and the chemistry meshed perfectly with Hewitt and Weaver from beginning to end. .",1395532800,,386,4.450704225352113

1297457,2,B00003CXWM,"Is it possible for a comedy to take itself seriously? This one does, in the ponderous, slow-paced way it sets up its jokes. It wants to ensure that you do NOT miss the punchlines. Sigourney and wazhername (the daughter)'s characters are heavily drawn with a verrrry thick felt pen that they are nearly cartoons, so their roles lack wit. Gene Hackman nearly saves the show several times but is finally overwhelmed. Watch the movie for 15 minutes, and then imagine what the Coen Brothers would have done with it. That will save you from having to watch the final 75 minutes.",1392768000,,572,4.673267326732673

The story begins in a church choir. A woman in a sky-blue dress is getting married. ""The best is yet to come"" says the song. The bride dances with others. She is carried down a long hall into a hotel room. She slips out of her dress, the groom removes her lingerie. Then Angela falls asleep! Cold water? ""What happened?"" She runs to the toilet. Dean returns to his office. [There is a surprise here!] His secretary greets him. ""Is that frostbite?"" His wife is surprised! Their lawyers haggle over the settlement. We see what is going on when they meet at a gas station. They discuss their next project over their meal. But the IRS is there with their surprise! They plan their next move to Palm Beach.

A woman slips and falls in the lobby. They look for a new prospect. ""We'd better work fast."" A cough gets a response. That night they begin to operate against their target. The auction doesn't go as planned. We see their ""Heimlich Maneuver""! Another car has an accident on a dark highway. Then a third! Ever see a car drive on its rim? Paige learns something about that bartender. High heels don't go with swampy ground. Paige gets friendly with a star-gazer. Is there a misunderstanding? [You can't fake a language with a native.] She sings a comic song by John Lennon. His housekeeper offers her a deal. Paige gets a ring with a meteorite for a stone. Can a planted lighter, jewelry, and cigarettes get an employee fired? Yes, and more. Allison interviews for the housekeeper position. She wants to please her employer. Jack waits for her, he is in love. But Jane wants to break off, she isn't right for him.

Olga shows a deportation order, but marriage will stop this. She is overjoyed. Allison meets Jack again. Will they marry? William coughs and drops to the floor. How will they handle this problem?

Dean has a respectable business ""chopping cars"". There is a surprise party for Jack. Jane is there. But Angela has a new career path for Dean.
This is a funny comedy if you can overlook the problems with the characters or its implausibility in today's world where you can research people and places on the Internet. ""Beware of friendly well-dressed strangers who try to sell you something"" is very old advice.

The mother then divorces the guy and lands a big settlement.  Their plans go wrong in a number of different ways--the final misstep occurring when the daughter falls for one of their marks, a lovable dimwit bar-owner.  Some of the schemes hatched by these girls are genuinely funny--look for the bellboy who they distract with a glance of Hewitt partially undressed to get out of paying their hotel bill!  In the end, however, the characters in this movie are too lacking in depth for me to care very much what happens to them.

The one character that I found somewhat interesting was an unscrupulous New Jersey wiseguy played by Ray Liotta--who had also been one of the girls' marks.  Unlike the others characters, Liotta's guy is neither a dope, nor a complete scoundrel.  He likes a good score as much as the next con man, but draws the line at ruining the life of somebody who's done nothing wrong.  In a way, he seems to subscribe to the code expressed by George C.

I wasn't expecting great things: poor reviews, Jennifer Love Hewitt, and I couldn't see how they could make this come to a happy ending. I'm happy to say I was wrong; I have no clue what the critics were whining about, this was a fantastic movie! Dialogue & situations were clever & quick, very little down time, there's always something happening, and somehow they all make their less-than-honorable characters very likeable. This movie even changed my overall opinion of JLH's talent, she did a GREAT job as a girl raised to be a con artist but suffering the attack of the unfamiliar conscience and, even worse, love.

Yes, there were parts where I laughed, but overall it was a let down. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny either, and a lot of the points that I found funny were more so from being awkward points. The acting was pretty good but the plot line was not very amusing and did not hold my interest for very long. It is not the worst movie I've ever seen but I would not recommend it, it's really not even worth the 3 buck rental. And for a ""light"" romantic comedy it was a little on the long and drawn out side as well. Not exactly horrible, but not very good either.",1320796800,,738,4.24113475177305

1297899,3,B00003CXWM,"Now that I know that this movie was trying to be `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels: The Female Chronicles' I'm not sure I like it as much as I remember.  Its funny how that works, isn't it.  `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' is one of my favorite comedies (hilarious) and this film lacks a lot of the intelligence and wit that that film had (in spades).

That said; this film was fun.

I don't really think you can go wrong with Sigourney Weaver or Gene Hackman.  You can go very (very) wrong with nearly everyone else in the cast, especially Jennifer Love Hewitt, but she actually nails her role (not too hard to play an arrogant spoiled brat though, is it).

The film centers around mother/daughter con-artists Max and Page Conners who make it a habit of scamming rich men out of their money (Max marries them and then gets her hot young daughter to seduce them so she can divorce them, taking them for everything they have...or at least half).  Things get complicated when Page decides she wants to do the baiting, getting someone halfway decent for a change (as apposed to the older, less attractive men her mother snatches up).  They wind up both baiting two very different men, and things get even stickier when Page actually falls in love.

There are many laughs, most of which are cheap, but the cast is having a lot of fun and it shows.  Weaver is a comedic goldmine most of the time, and while this is far from her best work, it is very entertaining.  Hewitt is hot, and Lee is charming...and Hackman, well, he's Hackman!  Like I said, cheap laughs but it doesn't really matter.  You man not be running to this one over and over again, but it will deliver the goods on a lazy afternoon.",1276473600,,1679,4.483552631578948
1297948,3,B00003CXWM,"Heartbreakers / B00003CXWM

A cute, zany comedy of the ""love sucks"" variety, ""Heartbreakers"" follows the adventures of a mother-daughter con team who prey on moderately-wealthy shady businessmen and trick them into quick marriage-divorce-profit scenarios for their daily bread and butter. When the daughter of the duo decides to strike out on her own, her mother pulls a series of her own cons in hopes of keeping her daughter ""safe"" and tied to her forever - and each predictably spins off into zany dysfunction.

The premise is cute, and Weaver and Hewitt dazzle in their performance, switching between their roles consummately - however, the replay value of this movie may not be as high. The plot with Hewitt and her love interest seems less about learning trust and maturity, and more about finding ""the one"" guy who won't bag your mother/aunt on your wedding night...and once you find him, you're romantically set for life. Since most infidelities don't occur at first opportunity, however, this creates a bit of a Family Unfriendly Aesop, on top of the whopping problems that somehow the leading ladies should try to make a concerted go with their beaus based on nothing more than mild mutual attraction and a couple of whirlwind romances based on wildly false premises. Probably best not too think too hard on that aspect.

We don't go to zany rom coms for clever Aesops, we go for fun and ""Heartbreakers"" is definitely fun for a single watch - but repeated viewings may not be your cup of tea.

1297949,5,B00003CXWM,"I first saw this movie when it originally came out 9 years ago. I was 14 back then, and though the subject matter was a little mature for me then, I still loved it. Today 23, this movie is still one of my favorites. Though the twists are old and the laughs predictable, it's still a great movie and is especially fantastic when watched with someone who has never seen it before!

Being general, the movie is--in my opinion--a sophisticated comedy. From the very first twist until the final turn at the end, this movie holds one's attention! There's sex, slapstick, and dark comedy, but it all comes together very well in my opinion. Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie a 52% because of the consensus that the movie was long, the romantic subplot did not fit well, and the characters were unsympathetic. I disagree on all three counts, but I also believe the third is irrelevant; this film is cut from the same cloth as Liar, Liar and went to the school of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. It's fun, entertaining, and clever. Definitely 5 stars in my book.",1275696000,,1043,4.577540106951871
1297950,3,B00003CXWM,"HEARTBREAKERS offers a story rarely touched upon, is a good comedy, a
riot, in fact, such that many may not be able to not laugh out loud,
mainly from the curious aspects in the dialog, other times from the
quality of the acting, especially from Ray Liotta, and Gene Hackman,
both marks of the confidence ladies played by Sigourney Weaver, and
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

The marketing of the movie is succesful in the sense that the movie
delivers exactly was promised, in terms of comedy, quality acting
from veteran, proven successful actors, that relaxes the audiences,
and leaves them wondering how realistic is the behavior shown on
screen.

The controversial theme has a dual edge to it, with some finding it
objectionable to laugh at dispicable, insidious behavior, which is
the entrapment of single moderately wealthy to rich men, creating
incidents for divorce, and laughing all the way to the bank,
afterwards.

Other behaviors also covered are several examples shown in the
movie, such as freeloading at restaurants, hotel rooms, gas stations,
reinforcing the above analysis.

These pro's are experts in creating totally believable circumstances,
manipulating their mark's thought processes, to forgone conclusions,
which they carry out in public, or even among themselves, quite
surprisingly or not.

The cinematography is not too far from TV-like, but still has the
necessary ingredients to please most audiences, with a nice
wide-screen format, and a momentum that never lets down in terms of
action.

The critics to this movie, as well, may touch also upon the exuberant
youth projected by Hewitt, sometimes excessively so, compromising the
overall project's credibility in terms of acting, but also in terms
of the type of audience this picture will command, probably those
below 17 years of age. This stems from condoning the behavior of the
two ladies. I would not underestimate Hewitt, despite this.

Other questionable, or unnecessary aspects is the excess libido that
is relentlessly demonstrated on screen, suggesting that nobody can
shield themselves from their basic instincts, or avoid being played
on that basis, which is obviously a flawed theory. Some may find
HEARTBREAKERS somewhat sleazy, although the goal is to underline the
comedy aspect, the easy laughs that for some, may find gets old fast
over 90 mins.

Apart from the greed shown, thoughtless adultery is suggested as part
of ladies behavior as a necessary evil in their setups, which may
also be objectionable to some.

The only morality in this story, is Liotta, despite his own mobster
type of persona, vocabulary, mannerisms tells the ladies ""Do you have
any idea how much therapy you need ? "", later telling them one thing,
but doing another, when he plays into their hands, as he is
manipulated and capitulates to their domination.

For those who appreciate comedy, even on a difficult theme like this
one, HEARTBREAKERS will win them over, if not for the charisma,
professionalism, and skill brought into the picture by Weaver,
Hewitt, and Hackman. Funny, a riot over 90 mins",1270166400,,3067,5.140562248995984

""Heartbreakers"" is about a mother-daughter pair of grifters: Max (Sigourney Weaver) and Page Conners (Jennifer Love Hewitt). (Get it? They are con artists, and therefore they're 'conners.') Max claims she is saving herself until she gets married. She celebrates heartily at the wedding reception, and then, just prior to consumation on the honeymoon, she conks out. Meanwhile, Page has ingratiated herself into the mark's life. She has a job as his receptionist, for example. When he returns to work still unsatisfied he is vulnerable to Page's full dcolletage press. Mom barges in to find the mark in flagrante delicto. She sues for divorce, along with a healthy settlement.

So far, so good. I enjoyed the twisted mother-daughter dynamic between Weaver and Love Hewitt.

-------------------------------
Max Conners: Maybe you'd like a spanking?
Page Conners: Just try it. I dare you!
=========================================

Kind of like ""The Joy Luck Club"" meets ""The Grifters."" When they move to Palm Beach, Florida, in search of new targets, that's when ""Heartbreakers"" stumbles. Max sets her sights on billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman). Mirkin uses one running gag: he is a chain smoker with a hacking cough. This soon gets tiresome. What is it with Mirkin and the whacky nomenclature? Casting Hackman as a smoker with a hacking cough? People who live in glass mirkins should not throw stones.

For some reason Max affects a Russian accent for this con, if for no other reason than to cry about deportation, thus hastening the mark's marriage proposal. Sigourney is no Streep, and maybe that's the point of one amusing scene in a Russian restaurant where she fails miserably to convince Native Russian Speakers of her authenticity. But, like Hackman's hacking cough, the faux accent also became annoying in short order.

Ray Liotta was good as the mark ""Dean"" in the first act, but when he returns he mostly just gets in the way. A few jokes hit their mark, but many miss. The best thing about the second part is the ongoing war/romance between Page and Jack Withrowe (Jason Lee).

-----------------
Jack Withrowe: Hi. Can I get you a drink?
Page Conners: Wow! I've never heard that one before. You really blow me away with your creativity.
Jack Withrowe: Well, I...
Page Conners: ""Well, I, uh..."" Your recovery's even better! Do you even care at all who I am? I mean, I could be the Antichrist or have the intelligence of a thermos, but unfortunately *those* are not the matters the male ***** ponders. So please tell me, why did you walk all the way over here to ask to get me a drink?
Jack Withrowe: Well, because... I'm the bartender.
===========================

When she finds out he is not only the bartender, but the bar owner, she sets her sights on him as her next mark. Of course, she never expected to fall for the guy, though her mother warned her. Mothers. What would we do without them?

--------------------
Max Conners: How do I look?
Page Conners: If I were a guy, I'd do you.
==============================

Somehow though, I get the feeling that the marketing department wasn't 100% behind Sigourney Weaver, especially if you look at the box cover. The picture doesn't even look like her.

----------------------------
Max Conners: You will respect your mother and do the con.
Page Conners: Keep dreaming, witch!
Max Conners: You are not too old to spank!
========================================

Nora Dunn and Kevin Nealon, both former SNL cast members, have funny cameos.
Anne Bancroft plays Max's con artist mentor. Director David Mirkin even pulls a Hitchcock as Jack's lawyer. Zach Galifianakis (who is on fire since ""The Hangover"") and Sarah Silverman play Jack's friends, but talk about wasted resources. They just sit there while those of lesser comedic gifts flail about helplessly.

----------------------
Max Conners: I'm sorry, Page. I'm a terrible mother. I'm a terrible everything.
Page Conners: [comforting her] You're finally seeing things clearly.

1297955,5,B00003CXWM,"This is a must-have for any hetero male who can't wait for it to come around again on cable TV. Forget all the bad reviews; all that matters is that Jennifer Love Hewitt is painfully hot in this movie.  Actually it's a half-decent film that rises above the level of sex comedies aimed at the 18-35 knuckle-dragging audience. But that doesnt' matter. Yeah, it's light fare but you won't care. The cast is full of A-listers (Gene Hackman, Sigourney Weaver, Ray Liotta, Jason Lee, Anne Bancroft, Nora Dunn, Sarah Silverman, Carrie Fisher) who turn in professional performances, but you might not even notice. Hackman is so adept as a hacking, liver-spotted geriatric that you might be grossed out, but you'll get over it. All that really matters is the amazing Hewitt bouncing around in an endless series of slinky micro dresses. I have a friend in the film/video industry who tells me that all the studio execs wish JLH was their girlfriend, and after seeing *Heartbreakers* I'm not surprised.

A definite desert-island pick.",1199232000,10,1023,4.907514450867052
1297956,3,B00003CXWM,"For a chick-flick, the film does well to aim no higher than some shallow raunchy old fun. There is enough air in the beginning romp to draw you in. It is only when you find yourself predicting exact lines and jokes that you begin to wonder if there is much meat left past the first hour.

As the mother in a mother-daughter con-woman pair, Sigourney Weaver is by turns comical and lascivious. Subjective opinion: I found her significantly more fetching than the younger Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is pesky as usual but teenagers and brain candy diehards may find her entertaining in that lightly adoloscent way. Liotta I simply feel sorry for, what a tragic waste of Goodfellas calibre talent. Gene Hackman serves reliably as an aging stumblebum, but gets no more than ten minutes of actual screentime.

The theme has an unmistakable halo of the much sharper Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, which leaves one hoping for that clever twist that never quite materializes. Instead the film breaks into a half-bummed pondering of profound issues: the need for the mother to Let Go, the importance of true love that trumps a grifter's dayjob, and suchlike. All of which is ham-handed and tacked on to the last hour in a rush.

At best a fluffy rental for evenings when nothing else is on. Know that you are watching a light chick-flick and you will do fine.",1145232000,,1342,4.726495726495727
1297957,5,B00003CXWM,"This movie is laugh-out-loud hilarious!  Sigourney and Jennifer are the perfect, scheming mother-daughter duo.  Ray Liotta was great as the crooked, but head-over heels, love interest for Sigourney, while Gene outdid himself as the cough-out-a-lung millionaire she tried to marry.  I even loved the maid!

But, I must give the biggest kudos to Jason Lee (My Name Is Earl) as the heartthrob who steals Jennifer's heart and gets her to change her evil ways.

This movie deserves nothing less than 5 stars since it did something which very few ""comedies"" do for me - it allowed me to laugh out loud!  You won't be disappointed.",1143676800,2,624,4.895238095238096

Besides, Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt are both amazing actresses, and they both made their roles very good and very convincingly...One thing we have to face: this is one of those typical ""stupid movies"" in which all the cast do is funny, but let's face another thing: PEOPLE LOVE THAT!!! I totally agree with the other reviewer who said that he/she almost choaked on him/herself...maybe the people who ranked this movie with 1 star haven't even watched it, but only they know.

1297998,4,B00003CXWM,"I have to give Sigourney Weaver major props for this movie. Heartbreakers is hilarious and part of the reason for it is her. Sigourney & Love-Hewitt are a mother-daughter con team. Mother & daughter seek out rich men, get them to fall in love with and marry mother (Sigourney) and then trick them out of their money. It's so sneaky & crafty. And the scenery is beautiful (even though I see it everyday since I live in South Florida). Love-Hewitt really works it too, but Sigourney steals the show, especially as she pretends to be a wealthy Russian woman trying to get Gene Hackman's old, chain-smoking-and-ready-to-drop-dead character to marry her. And Love-Hewitt wants to run her own scam which she's doing behind her mother's back. I don't want to give anything else away. Ray Liotta is also very good as Sigourney's first husband (well, the firs husband of hers we meet...she mentions at one point something about all 13 of her weddings were beautiful). It's a funny movie that points out that no matter how hard you try and fight it, one of these days love will catch even the most guarded of us when we least expect it to. It's worth it for the song Sigourney sings at the restaurant.",1138838400,2,1191,4.649289099526066
1297999,3,B00003CXWM,"The movie sheds light on a mother and daughter who try to con men out of large amounts of money.

The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.

The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), while the humor and the plot are just about average.

Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...

In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here.",1138060800,,567,4.203703703703703

1298002,3,B00003CXWM,"I bought this film absolutely ages ago, and have only just got around to watching it. I was quite surprised that Jennifer Love Hewitt (Paige) & Sigourney Weaver (Max) made such a good pairing in the movie, a great mother & daughter team. Others considered for their roles were: Cameron Diaz, Alicia Silverstone, Cher and Anjelica Huston. (Anjelica & Cher obviously for the mother roles!)

I hate JLH with a passion, probably cos she wears as little as possible throughout, and will have every guy's tongue hanging out. And she plays the same character in every movie. She cannot play another character. Rant over.

Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman, & Ray Liotta were outstanding in this movie, considering what little they had to work with. Jason Lee was fabulous as ever, he can't do anything wrong! :) And Sigourney was very brave to get up & sing ""Back In The USSR"" in a Russian restaurant. (I still don't understand why she was pretending to be Russian.)

There's a lot of establishing shots in this, which other reviewers have spoken about, but what's amazing is, that for the amount of car scenes there are, JLH never drove in any of the car scenes.

The card handling that JLH does in the restaurant (saying it relaxes her) was taught to her by stage magician Ricky Jay. She actually learned more tricks than that, but was unable to do them in the movie because she broke her finger. The most expensive shot in the movie was when JLH leaned against the car to talk to Ray Liotta near the end of the movie. Because it was cold on set, she had a white sweatshirt around her waist that was in the shot, and it had to be digitally taken out.

Overall, this film has everything a film needs to have, and that's mainly a totally implausible storyline, and a happy ending, which really didn't work well considering the rest of the film. OK, I'm kidding (am I?) The film is OK, but not really worth a look unless you're a JLH fan.",1120348800,,1927,4.525862068965517
1298003,1,B00003CXWM,"This movie was completely irritating.  Here are ten (10) observations:

1. Who ever told Jennifer Love Hewett she could act?

2. Nothing really happens in this film. It's one establishing shot after another, after another. We see characters opening and closing doors, getting in and out of automobiles, walking into restaurants... for about two hours.

3. The dialogue is largely meaningless. It's like watching people speak in esperanto or some language entirely foreign to earth. This is because:

4. The characters in this film are completely the figment of someone's imagination, with no roots in reality. If anyone could relate to the characters that Ray Liotta, Sigourney Weaver, Love Hewett or Gene Hackman portrayed, I'd certainly like to interview them for ""Sixty Minutes"".

5. After about forty minutes into the film, Sigourney Weaver breaks into song. I hoped that her rendition of ""Back in the USSR"" was the low point of the film, but unfortunately, I was wrong.

6. The whole concept behind this film was rather formulaic, with a rather poor foundation. The end result is something from the bizarro world, like a $450,000.00 home built from clapboard and thrown-out furniture crates.

7. For the last hour or so, the film unravels spectacularly, much like a burning Zeplin heading down to earth. However, this film was not as bad as ""AI: Artificial Intelligence"", because that film was in a class of awfulness all by itself. Even so, it was still a hateful experience to watch ""Heartbreakers"".

8. I hope that in the future, someone will purchase this film, dispense with all the dialogue, and rearrange each scene into a more credible story, a la Woody Allen's ""What's Up Tiger Lilly"".

9. One nice thing about the movie is that you can leave the dvd running, and take a long break to get something to eat, come back to watch the movie, and not really miss anything.

10. Would I recommend ""Heartbreakers"" to my friends? Sure.. Anything's better than having to sit through ""The English Patient""!",1118620800,5,2009,4.949404761904762

1298005,2,B00003CXWM,"This is a mildly funny but predictable comedy saved from total oblivion by the hilarious performance of Gene Hackman, as an elderly and ill tobacco baron and would-be dupe of two women aiming to bilk him out of his fortune. Sigourney Weaver is quite skilled in her role as a mother who has taught her daughter (Jennifer Love Hewitt) never to trust men and to use them for all they are worth. Having just pulled off a scam on Ray Liotta to get his fortune, the women set out to deceive just one last time. Although Hackman is a laugh riot in this role and Weaver is lukewarm-funny, Love Hewitt is annoying and her obvious/predictable ""love story"" leaves one sick to the stomach. Mindless entertainment.",1110585600,,701,4.616
1298045,2,B00003CXWM,"The best I can say about ""Heartbreakers"" is that, at times, I laughed! This is billed as a lightweight romantic comedy/con caper. As cons go, it is all too predictable - as a matter of fact, I believe it's  been done before, and better, in ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels."" And any romance involved here is lukewarm, at best.

Sigourney Weaver and  Jennifer Love-Hewett play mother daughter grifters, Maxine and Page Conners, (and a variety of colorful aliases), on the lookout for any man wealthy enough to be bilked for all he's got. Curvy Moma Conners is on husband number 13, and her aide-de-camp, 20 year-old Page, has her own game going with Jack, (Jason Lee), a monied bar owner. The duo also has a vast repertoire of  money-making scams, from putting glass in restaurant food for a free meal to securing a complimentary suite of rooms in a posh Palm Beach hotel. At first these con-games are funny, but after a while they grow old and one can see them coming a mile away.

The IRS threatens jail unless Maxine and Page come up with undeclared back taxes. So they're off for ""one last score."" Ray Liotta plays Dean Cumanno, the last man Max ripped-off. He is still wildly in love with her, even after she took him to the cleaners and got his Mercedes to boot. He takes off in pursuit not knowing all the facts about his ex. Ailing billionaire tobacco baron William Tensy, (Gene Hackman), who looks a few days over one hundred, with ashen, liver-spotted skin, pink nose and a 5 pack-a-day-man's hacking cough, is the next target. I must say, Weaver, playing the Russian vamp Olga, makes for some big laughs, and she has the accent down pat. And Hackman is so disgusting, he's cool! There's a wild dinner scene where she is asked to sing in Russian, which could be worth the rental price alone. Unfortunately, Love-Hewett, who does petulant with a capitol ""P"", has an extremely limited range.

The film moves at a reasonable pace, although not fast enough to make it work as a comedy. It starts good, but goes downhill  way before the conclusion. And it's far too long at 123 minutes  - I mean this is NOT ""War and Peace."" Weaver, who has a knack for comedy, gets to ham it up and have fun. Apparently director Dave Mirkin wants his audience to focus on his stars' natural assets. There is enough cleavage shown here to warrant the attendance of any man who wants to watch. However, the continual,  although partial, baring of boobs is just another cliche. The characters are likeable and the chemistry is good, especially between mother and daughter - but good will and likeable are not enough to hold a film together. This one needs more cement!

The story was nice and clever and personally I enjoyed each and every line-dialogue that existed in the movie!! The atmosphere in the movie was great and I believe that the director did a talented and wonderfull job developing the movie as he takes the maximum out of every actor in the movie.

  The romance within the comedy kicks in just about the right time and despite the high speed with which the movie goes on(its just a movie after all) I really loved the whole concept.

  To all people who like comedies-romantic comedies you will certainly like this one more or less.

  As for me this is one of the best comedy films I have ever seen and it came as a great surprise as I rent it from the video club not knowing anything about the plot or the movie.

  Having seen some negative remarks about this film I am not a great film reviewer or anything and I judge this film without comparing it to other older ones regarding the plot etc. I don't care if this film copied an older or it stole the plot, or the story was silly, of men are silly etc!! Simply this was the best (non-black comedy) romantic film that I saw the last few years that I liked and enjoyed each and every minute of it!

1298047,4,B00003CXWM,"Are men really as dumb as they appear to be in Heartbreakers? Well if I had woman in my life that acted like the two in this, yeah I'd probaly do what the guys in this do.

Max Connors(Weaver) scans men. She seduces them and marries them. She then gets her hot daughter Paige(Hewitt) to seduce them and just when there about to you know what she walks in on them. She then divorces them and takes half of their assests. Shes been doing it her whole life and they just did it to Dean(Liotta). It looks like the girls are off for a big pay and Paige looks to go out on her own. That is until the IRS bust them for tax eviction and leaves them broke.

The two head off to Palm Beach to look for big money and they find that in William B. Tensy(Hackman) a tobacco company owner worth 3 billion. He's the play and things are going good. That is until Paige starts trying to play Jack(Lee) a local bar owner worth a couple of million. She's falling in love with him. They also have to deal with Dean who's come back looking for love with Max. The girls now have little time to see if they can play Tensy.

Sigourney Weaver is gorgeous in the movie. It's hard to believe she is in her early fifties dressing the way she does. She is so hot to be that old. Shes funny and her singing Back in the USSR with a bad Russian accent is terrific. You have to love what she does and brings to this movie. It's a different kind of character. You almost have trouble believing this gorgeous woman was once bald in Alien series.

Jennifer Love Hewitt gives one of the best performances of her young carear. Whew is she hot in this movie. She is so hot in all those tiny dresses and thank the lord for the wonder bra. Im 20 years old and shes my favorite part of the movie. Her chemistry with Lee is real good and looks authentic.

Gene Hackman is funny in this. The two time Oscar winner is the disgusting tobacco guru. He's always smoking like a chimney in the movie and he looks horrible. The make up guys did good with him. His love scenes with Weaver kill me. They are so funny with him kissing her and blowing smoke out at the same time. It's even better when I found out Weaver didn't know he was going to do it.

Ray Liotta and Jason Lee are also great. Liotta is always great in his movies. Lee is one of the funniest underrated guys in Hollywood. This is a different kind of character for him. I'd rather see him do more stuff like Mallrats. The two are still good though.

The DVD extras are pretty good. There are 18 deleted scenes. There is plenty of commentary on the movie. There are a couple of documentaries on the movie that are quite interesting. The DVD extras add to the movie.

This is a great DVD. It's a funny movie with gorgeous woman and a happy ending. It's pretty easy to find cheap. I wouldn't rent it because you can get it at a lot of places for a little more than a rental. If you don't like the story the men should at least enjoy the eye candy. So don't miss out Heartbreakers.

1298048,2,B00003CXWM,"This had a good premise, good actors to play the parts. Sigourney Weaver,although a little long in the tooth to be playing a fem fatale, is competent and Hackman stole the movie with his nicotine drenched old rich guy. When these two actors were on the screen, it was watchable indeed. The big snoozer in this movie was Jennifer Love Hewitt whose only noteworthiness was big silicone implants in tight clothing.

Whenever she came on the screen away from Weaver, the movie fell flat ASLEEP! She has neither the talent, charisma or looks to carry a movie by herself (so,we haven't seen much of her lately have we?)

This movie is watchable IF you rent it and fastforward out the parts with Hewitt. The scams Weaver pulled were fascinating and cutting out Hewitt and concentrating on Weaver desperately looking for an old rich guy with one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel would have been a better story.",1090800000,2,918,4.625766871165644

 After leaving the latest victim (Ray Liotta), who seems to have genuine feelings for Weaver, the mother-daughter team target a rich tobacco billionaire, played by Gene Hackman. Hackman is terrific, and really, the movie is worth watching just because of him. He is a crude, uncouth, vulgar old man who smokes like a chimney and coughs up phlegm all the time (Hewitt correctly says that any sexual relations with him would be necrophilia). He is absolutely repulsive and hilarious.

 The one thing that slowed this movie down was the relationship that develops between Hewitt and a local bartender, for whom she experiences the first real feelings she's had towards a man in her whole life. The way the relationship develops didn't strike me as completely plausible, and there comes a point where too many plot twists are thrown in; this in turn slows the entire movie down.

Page(Hewitt)orignally goes after a mommys boy millionaire but comes unstuck with him and then turns on the barman with distain untill she realises that he owns the place.  She tries to work him but falls in love with him instead.
Cheesey and light, the plot is simple. I thought it more a Love Hewitt in short skirts and tight pants pleasure movie, as she still hadn't quite grown out of her teenage body. Sigorney Weaver still manages to hold her own and the wedding night scene (with husband Ray Liotta)at the start still attests to this, she may be mid-aged but she still has her ""Alien"" figure.",1078704000,,1086,4.705263157894737

1298097,5,B00003CXWM,"""Heartbreakers"" stars Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Ray Liotta, Gene Hackman, and others.  This is a great comedy for all ages.  Its humor keeps its viewers laughing during and after watching.  Its theme of a woman who cons many men offers many interesting twists and turns, always keeping everyone interested.  Such theme takes a big turn when her daughter begins sliding away from her for a man, whom she truly falls in love with.  The suspense builds as her most recent ex-husband searches for her.  The writers are brilliant.  The actors offer their own humor.  Sigourney Weaver performs her role as the con artist wonderfully.  Her fake russian accent can fool anyone.  Her performance of ""Back In the USSR"" almost lives up to the original Beatles version.  Gene Hackman's role as her latest victim is hilarious.  The smoke constantly blowing out of his mouth and his nostrils gives the movie its own flamboyance.  Everyone else also acts their roles wonderfully.  ""Heartbreakers"" is a great comedy for those looking for a laugh fest.  This unforgettable experience will not disappoint its viewers.  Those wanting more should also watch the special features.  They have many interesting clips: deleted scenes (including Weaver's full performance of ""Back In the USSR""), interviews, behind the scenes footage, and more.",1070150400,2,1333,5.212264150943396

Reading the reviews it seems everybody has their favorite actor, for me it was Gene Hackman. He is the tobacco wealthy target of Mom and Daughter Sigourney Weaver and Jenifer Love Hewitt and he will show you why you should not be smoking. From his stained teeth, nicotine yellow fingers, to his hack-hack he is absolutely disgusting. He is funny because you always know it is Gene Hackman playing a role.

Gene Hackman is hilarious as William Tensy, their latest target, a chain-smoking millionaire who doesn't appear to have much longer to live. Ray Liotta is fantastic as one of their past cons, who was truly in love with Weaver. The always energetic Jason Lee is the guy in love with Hewitt's Paige, who is also beginning to fall for him.
It's a wonderfully complicated love circle with some hilarious results. Hackman steals the show, and Weaver is quite funny and amusing, especially when sporting her Russian accent. Anne Bancroft delivers her usual good performance in an almost cameo role as Weaver's mentor.
Heartbreakers is not as cruel as it could be, but always a delight to watch. Some have found the length a bit much, but it moves along at trip-hammer speed, engrossing all the way through. I feel it is a truly underrated comedy and one of the best 2001 had to offer.",1046736000,30,1151,4.788944723618091

1298106,3,B00003CXWM,"This is a movie with a plot totally full of holes.  A movie that does many of the things I hate about Hollywood.  But they get away with it in this case because they do just enough things well to make it worth a look.
First, the plot holes.  This is a movie about a mother-daughter con-artist team.  It's giving away nothing that mom, Sigourney Weaver, gets rich guys to marry her.  Then, apparently after setting records for post-nuptial headaches to prevent any actual consummation, she gets nubile daughter Jennifer Love-Hewitt to get into a compromising position with the guy, and gets approximately half of his net worth in the divorce settlement.
While certainly possible, I don't buy several twists to the plot.  First, even though there is a small plot twist to explain this, there are times when they seem to have no money at all, although even though this point contradicts itself.  On one hand, they resort to extremely petty cons for things like gas and hotel rooms (which would be spotted immediately by hotel management and endanger the big score).  On the other hand, the overhead for their cons, such as renting a mini-yacht to scout out suckers and buying the wardrobes necessary to appear rich themselves would cost a small fortune in itself.  So this part doesn't wash.
Nor does the way Hollywood has been treating male-female attraction ever since Hollywood began.  Yes, believe me, I know that the right kind of female get-up gets guys, including myself, all ga-ga.  And this is the basis of the movie.  But with scene after scene of guys practically willing to sign over their net worth after just a smile gets the point across with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  The bar owner takes way too much garbage from Hewitt to make it believable.  And the Ray Liotta character, considering his profession, would never wait until marriage for ""his"" big score.  For you ladies at home wanting to try this occupation, reality says you'll probably have to go that ""extra mile"" before marriage to get the brass, I mean, gold ring.
Ok, so why as high as three stars?  First, it's a professional project with a professional set of actors.  While I really hate smoking, Gene Hackman is a scream as one of the targets, who puts his cigarette out in other peoples' drinks, generally ignores ""No Smoking"" signs, and even does studies to hook 9-year-olds on the habit.  While all of this would range from rude to unthinkable in real life, Hackman, who can't seem to do a bad performance, is hilarious here.  Weaver and Liotta also handle the timing their roles require, even though I emphasize his character would NOT have waited until marriage, and would NOT have used her wedding night excuse as a reason to stop.
But even though I've slammed the way Hollywood handles sex in a leering, teasing manner, I will also declare my hypocrisy by stating that the performance of Jennifer Love-Hewitt got me hook, line and sinker.  They could not have cast a better actress for the part, and she's perfect on screen.  Not for the acting, mind you.  While adequate, I don't believe for a minute she is ready for the life she chooses at the end.  But it's her screen presence that blows me over.  Normally I would be really ticked off with all the teasing that goes on with no nudity to back it up.  But sometimes in life you just have to conform to peer pressure.  The lady is so sexy here, with dresses that are shorter than my T-shirts, and heels longer than my, well, never mind, you got me.  You hear me Hollywood!  You got me on this one!",1045872000,,3540,4.6298076923076925

But alas, it came on a satellite movie channel one day and I decided to sit down and watch it. Page(Hewitt) is a young woman who is trying to free herself of her mother Max(Weaver) and her mother's scams to marry men and then use Page as a bait to get the men into the divorce court and claim their entire accounts. After scamming a hot-car ring boss(Ray Liotta) the girls move on to the expensive likes of Palm Beach, Florida, where a tobacco tycoon (Gene Hackman) is moments from death. This plan goes very good but Page finds herself falling for a guy and her mother realizes that she might still have feelings for her ex-husband.

I enjoy this movie a lot, like ""Trojan War"" I was laughing at all the hijinks (not to mentioned smiling all the way) throughout the film (when Hewitt appears in her first scene, to the end of the movie).
What can I say, I'm big fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt!  I admit, however I was kind of surprised with the outfits she and Weaver wore for the film (considering I was so use to see Hewitt as the girl next door thing when she was in ""Party Of Five"").

1298170,4,B00003CXWM,"Okay, I'll try to keep this brief.
Heartbreakers is hilarious. It might not have the same quirky and ""I can relate to that"" qualities that, say, Nora Ephron's movies have, but you'll be laughing out loud. It delivers some funny dialogue and fantastic physical comedy. It, of course, has the requisite more-dramatic-moments, but those are well-achieved too.
The performances in this movie are integral to its humour. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt not only have good comic chemistry but can hold their own as well. Weaver proves she's got range by taking on such a weird character. She nails the fake Russian accent too. Hewitt not only looks great, but brings a hilarious element to the cast as her character seems to get into all kinds of fixes and has to struggle with getting her way out of them. She does a great job. Gene Hackman is beyond funny. He nails the ""gross old man"" thing and easily stands out in terms of eccentricity. I saved the best for last- Jason Lee (probably the most underrated actor ever). I LOVE Jason Lee, but even people who aren't obsessive fans like me(I'm striving to get him more famous- okay, and to become his lover.), he's lovable. Women will fall in love with his character. His presence is magnetic; his character is sweet and realistic. (He's just as easy to fall in love with as A Walk To Remember's Jimmy Landon, but there isn't a real guy who's anything like the latter) Jason Lee nailed another role.
I strongly recommend you watch ""Heartbreakers"". It may seem like a waste of time, but if you don't laugh once during the movie, I give you the right to take away my TV.",1044403200,,1622,4.615916955017301

Sigourney Weaver is still beautiful at her age, but this was such a demenaing role for her, after all, she is so much better than this movie gives her credit for.
Ray Liotta is ridiculous, I think he's been getting type cast a lot since Goodfellas. It's a shame, because he was really good as white bread Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field Of Dreams.
Gene Hackman, the best thespian in the film, smallest part, least lines. This is just a travesty. Thought the purple shorts and green socks were hilarious. And the hacking and falling downa lot. Who knew he had it in him.
Anne Bancroft: give her more screen time.
The story: stupid. Very much like the review said, a female version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with a huge sacrifice in talent... I'm glad I didn't see it in the movie theatres, because it would not have been deemed worth the price of admission. It just stinks.",1043971200,,989,4.5

You come out of the theater with nothing more to say then ""so whatdaya wanna do now?"" There's nothing to even discuss about the movie, it was just so boring, it's the type of movie that makes 2 hours feel like an eternity. I do remember this movie being waaaayyyy too long. It's full of dumb stereotypes, stupid characters, dumb script, and goes to show that even some big name actors like Gene Hackman and Segourney Weaver will do just about anything to pay off last months credit card bills. I have nothing left to say except that a wise man once said ""There is nothing worse then a bad comedy."" HeartBreakers is one of them.

1298175,5,B00003CXWM,"It starts out with a beautiful wedding where a very happy looking woman is walking down the aisle of an enormous, beautiful church. She is to marry a very handsome man that she seems to be extremely happy with. This woman is Sigourney Weaver. It seems all lovey-dovey, doesn't it?
The next day, the groom goes into work and comes across his recently employed secretary, who also just happens to be Love Hewitt. This may just be a coincidence, or it may be planned. I'm not going to give what happens away, because you gotta see it. But I am going to tell you that it was no coincidence.
In this movie, Weaver and Hewitt play a mother-daughter duo that, through many comedic ways, con men, preferably rich men, into marrying one so that the other can force a divorce. That way, they end up rich AND single, all ready for another con.
Almost every second of this movie is full of laughter. And if it isn't full of laughter, it's full of male drool (for the 2 main women, of course), which is funny anyway!
Plus, the DVD includes many extras, including an audio commentary and all the deleted scenes. And some of the deleted scenes they should have never gotten rid of because they're so funny! The commentary is really cool because it shows more to the movie than meets the eye, and the director, Hewitt, and Weaver all talk. The commentary is meant to be watched after you see the movie, because it itself is put over the movie. The actresses are talking about the various scenes while you are watching it(the movie), which I thought was really cool.

The film is about a mother and daugther team working together to scam unsuspecting men for their money.  Some of the scenes in this film, are absolutely hilarious and will have you laughing out loud for minutes.  Heartbreakers isn't really a 'smart' funny film, it's more of a physical comedic film, meaning most of the laughs come from physical comedy such as golf clubs getting whacked against people's head, cars running into trees, people tripping and falling face flat on the floor, etc.
Jennifer Love Hewitt plays her ditzy, self-absorbed character extremely well.  Throughout the course of the film, her character changes and becomes more sympathetic as she begins falling in love with a man she's supposed to be scamming.  Jennifer represents this character extremely well.  Sigourney Weaver, Gene Hackman, and Ray Liotta are also fantastic in this film.  Most of the cast are mainly known throughout the world for their work in drama films, but they're also able to carry off this comedic film very well.  The cast is absolutely amazing.
The DVD has whopping extras.  Outtakes (which are extremely funny), Featurettes, trailers, deleted scenes, etc.  This is definitely worth a look.  Heartbreakers is a fun, hip, and hilarious comedy which is sure to have anyone with a sense of humor rolling in their seats.  If you're looking for a funny film with intelligence, skip this.

Should its director's chair be handed to a French (or anyone from Europe), it could be much better.  As it is, it misses many marks though it still is enjoyable ... sometimes.
The concept is this: Weaver & Hewitt, both sexy with a wide cleavage, live a life of con-women, fooling dumb...guys.  But that's not all.  They are really a mother and a daughter, and the latter is now about to leave her mom's domineering reign, to start a new life as a grifter of her own.  But the  daughter happens to meet a good-natured guy, and her mom, knowing that, try to induce her to deceive this honest new ""boyfriend"".  In the meanwhile, Mother got another target in the shape of rich Gene Hackman, who is likely to drop dead next moment....
The premise is interesting, and the performance is all good, including the pouting-mouthed daughter Jennifer Love Hewitt, and the silly boss of stolen-car dealers Ray Liotta (who seems to have recovered a thankless role of being part of dinner at Dr. Hannibal).  The film has some good moments, especially when Sigourney Weaver sings a Beatles song ""Back in the USSR"" with Russian accent, and Hackman again provides his still underused comic sense here.
But it is the director David Mirkin (of ""Romy & Michele's High School Reunion"" fame) that doesn't know what to do with these first-rate cast in order to generate genuine, comical momentum, giving too much unnecessary stress on the repeated clithe in character and story (just count the chances to see those leading ladies' clevarage).  To make matters worse, he misses every good opportunity that could have created hilarious moment -- Weaver's joyful song is cut short, Hackman is given too short time, etc. and lovely Hewitt always looks sullen.  And the worst is the mother-daughter relation, which often looks like one between mortal enemies.  Watch out how many times this mom exploits her daughter, tripping Ms Hewitt's leg in a hotel to get a room for free, spying on her date with a boy, and finally talking her into deceiving him to get money, and, moreover, delectable Jennifer almost is convinced !
Oh, I know it's a comedy, and I know she will relent and be sorry in the end, but it takes too much time till there (almost 2 hours) and moreover, lovely Hewitt seems to be spending her life, always grumbling under the shadow of her mom.  So why  don't you leave her once and for all?  After all, the trouble is coming from the fact that the film is afraid of involving  the matter of sex, and by including substitute gags, renders the whole work just another Hollywood clithe-ridden comedy.  Give this one some edge, with straightforward comments on sexual matters, or make it snappy.  These actors can do that.",1020470400,,2892,4.740518962075848
1298258,4,B00003CXWM,"Mother and daughter with a common ground: scamming money from unsuspecting husbands by staging adultery. If you can stand the plot line, and disregard inconsistencies, this could be an enjoyable movie.
The performances are unique: Sigourney Weaver brings sophistication to her humorous scoundrel of a character. Jennifer Love Hewitt represents beauty that is hidden under layers of materialism and awkwardness. Gene Hack-man brings a whole new meaning to his name. Ray Liotta jumps smoothly from one personality to another, as he is obsessed with the past. Jason Lee captures everyone's heart reminding all of how attractive loyalty is.
Summary: A great no-brainer movie if you don't get hung up on inconsistencies...Don't ever ask yourself 'How could that be?' To enjoy it, keep an eye out for the hints of honesty throughout the movie. It is, after all, mostly about deception.",1017878400,,879,5.285714285714286
1298259,3,B00003CXWM,"The brilliant opening sequence of 'Heartbreakers' explains what is right and wrong about the film.  Ray Liotta, who has just married a Catholic Sigourney Weaver who refused sex before marriage, is desperate for consummation, and eager to dispense with the polite wedding formalities of the bridegroom.  Weaver insists, however, on dancing with everyone in the room, and drinking her way into a chastity-belt stuopor.  When Liotta finally drags her away, director Mirkin expertly conveys the violence of his burning hormones and the inevitable frustration of his desire, by propulsive hand-held camera behind the raging stud, and a camera pulling away from him down an endless corridor.  Inevitably, by the time he gets his lady on the bed, she passes out.
Like 'Touch Of Evil', 'Heartbreakers' can be seen as the quest of the male hero to consummate the deferred kiss.  Like Charlton Heston in that movie, or many Bunuel leads, Liotta's complacent self-image is destroyed and he becomes violently consumed by this frustrated desire.  'Heartbreakers' might seem to be about powerful women - a mother and daughter team of con-artists who trick wealthy men into marriages, adultery and expensive divorces - but is really about the men who go crazy for these wild cards, who try to tame them.  The actreses (especially Weaver) try hard, but they achieve no real chemistry; their power is monotonous, their capitulation sentimental and sinister.  It is the men - chain-smoking, phlegm-spluttering, male-nude-statue-purchasing tobacco billinaire Gene Hackman; and Liotta in a wonderful send-up of his gangster image - that the film achieves its most wicked comic moments.  The women's work couldn't succeed if it wasn't for the rampant idiocies of the male libido, which lets men down as much as it exploits women (aw the poor loves).  The dreary mother and daughter love/hate stuff and the lure-of-true-love angst might ring true, but is considerably less fun.
That's why the opening scene is emblematic.  Mirkin brings to it the larger-than-life cartoon truth that he kept from his time at 'The Simpsons' and he injected into his debut 'Romy and Michelle's High-School Reunion', with exagerrated music, composition and camera-movement.  It focuses on the older characters - the battle-of-the-sexes sub-Hawksian tussle has always provided richer comic material than the generational conflict.  But in its sustained tease, in its leading up to jokes it never delivers, in its deferal of what is truly funny, the scene is all too symbolic.  After all, the driving force of the scene, Ray Liotta, disappears for over an hour!  The fault lies with the overlong script, which depends on the comic charm of the performers, rather than its own intrinisic merits, to succeed.",1016582400,,2762,5.245454545454545
1298260,4,B00003CXWM,"While we may be hesitant to admit it, America has a fondness for scoundrels. Maybe it's our nation's way of fighting its Puritan origins. Perhaps it's because we love freedom in all its many forms. The movies have always given us with characters who delight in bending the rules. From Mae West and W. C. Fields to The Godfather and Indiana Jones, we have laughed or cried, as the case may be, at their antics. The mother-daughter con team in the comedy Heartbreakers is Hollywood's latest devilish duo. This movie isn't destined to be a classic. It's too long, and it's not as clever as it should have been. Still, it provides an adequate number of laughs. Despite its limitations, it stands head and shoulder about this year's other comedies, most of which have had about as much class as a toilet bowl.
The opening shots are of the gorgeous wedding of Max and Dean [Sigourney Weaver and Ray Liotta]. Dean is completely smitten by Max and is clueless as to the problems that are about to develop. She is using an alias. He doesn't even know her real name is Max. He'd certainly be surprised to know this is her thirteenth trip down the aisle. No wonder she's so good at it. Poor Dean! The best is yet to come. His sexy new secretary, who is about to seduce him, is not only Max's partner, she's also her daughter, Page [Jennifer Love Hewitt]. Soon the ladies will be off to Palm Beach, taking with them all of Dean's heart and half of his fortune. Who will the ladies try to catch in Florida's playground of the rich? And what of Dean? Have they heard the last of him?
Weaver and Liotta make a welcome return to comedy, a medium they both excel at. Liotta is one of the few actors who can be funny and menacing at the same time. Also aboard is Gene Hackman, who plays Max's next victim, an obnoxious, chain-smoking tobacco heir named William Tensy. He appears to be having as much fun playing the part as we do watching him play it. Anne Bancroft has a small but delightful part as Barbara, the woman who taught Max everything. Jason Lee is fine as Jack, the guy Page accidentally falls in love with. Hewitt is the weak link in the cast. She plays Page as a woman totally devoid of charm, which makes Jack's falling for her a bit of a stretch.
This is a really lovely movie to look at. The color in the photography is vibrant and crisp. The location shots and the sets are dazzling. And those dresses! I rarely even notice dresses, but the ones designed for Weaver and Hewitt are knockouts. They remind us that a movie can say much about a character just by the way he or she is dressed.",1015891200,,2588,4.382536382536382
1298261,3,B00003CXWM,"I think Sigourney Weaver is one of our coolest actresses, and probably one of the most underrated.  Not that this is an Oscar role here---far from it---but she is always interesting to watch.  The premise of the movie is good but it never seems to reach its potential.  It does, however, have its funny moments.  Gene Hackman is hilarious as the tobacco tycoon who pratically breathes and exhales cigarette smoke and Ray Liotta does a fair job as the last man tricked by this mother/daughter con team.  It was nice to see Anne Bancroft in a cameo role and would have been better if we could have seen more of her.  As it was, there wasn't really anything very funny written for her.  Jennifer Love Hewitt fair well as the daughter but she is outshined by Sigourney Weaver.  This is not a great movie but its good enough to pass a couple of hours.",1015286400,,846,4.4480519480519485

You won't glean valuable insights into the meaning of the universe, as heartthrob Jason Lee innocently seeks in this lightweight offering, but you will have been pleasantly entertained. The unlikely cast of Weaver, Hewitt, Hackman, and Liotta work suprisingly well. Call it ""The Sting"" lite. This amusing farce revolves around the exploits of a mother and daughter team of gold digging grifters. Jennifer Love Hewitt as the daughter supplies plenty of eye candy, but her acting skills and comedic timing are first rate. I suspect we will be seeing a lot more of her in the future. You gotta love Gene Hackman as an obnoxious, unrepentant tobacco billionaire who's face seems to be perpetually obscured in a cloud of  cigarette smoke. Ray Liotta does not look much older than he did in ""Goodfellas"" and is hilarious as a shady businessman/love interest for Sigourney Weaver who in a rare comedic appearance, turns in a humorous performance. Several cameos by familiar personalities from television and film are unexpected fun. This is a movie that does not take itself too seriously and does not expect you too either.

1298263,2,B00003CXWM,"It's a rule of thumb that seldom steers you wrong: if a video cover shows the actors, who were obviously photographed at different times, crudely montaged together, the movie is going to stink. And, if that wasn't enough of a clue, carefully examine Ms. Weaver's glamorous head. Doesn't it seem just a bit too large for the sleek body it sits atop?
I normally wouldn't lead off my review with such trivia but, sad to say, it's the most interesting thing about this sourball of a comedy. I suppose it's the only game in town if you want to ogle Jennifer Dugs Hewitt's cleavage so if that's your kink, godspeed.
(The actresses' commentary on the DVD offers a nice illustration of their personal differences.

But what if one of the women actually starts to like a guy?  Well, you can fill in the blanks,  but it is pretty funny, and men can be pretty stupid and predictable when sex is apparently immediately available.

1298337,3,B00003CXWM,"Heartbreakers is a simple little movie with a simple little storyline. While it is a typical, by the numbers kind of a comedy film, it is still a pretty pleasant and modestly entertaining film. Not exactly one that will still be in your memory a while from now. Except for the ample bossom that is on full display here. Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt star as a mother-daughter con artist team who go to Palm Beach for one last big hit. They plan to attract billionaire Gene Hackman, who is in horrible health, so the mom can marry him and the daughter can set him up in a compromising way for the mom to catch and...voila!...instant money!. But, as usual, things go horribly wrong as the luscious duo try to correct things. All of the stars here are obviously game. Weaver is very good in her role as Angela. She definitley has a nice knack for comedy that she doesn't get to show off too often. A nice performance from a great actress. Hewitt also benefits here. Sure, her cleavage and, well, her whole body is amply on display in hot poses and clothes, but she does a good job. Her character wanting to break away from mommy dearest, only to realize it's a hard world out there on your own. This is a definite plus for her career. It should open her up to BIGGER and BETTER things. Plus, she's sexy as all hell here. Hackman is ridiculously silly. He's made up to look really awful and it works. Another performer not known for goofy comedy who pulls it off nicely. Ray Liotta is on hand as a victim of the duo's cons. He's an intense actor, but he lightens up here in a comedic role. Jason Lee also stars as a bar owner that Hewitt falls in love with. His role is pretty typical. Not given much to do. It's a predictable film really. I don't think anybody won't know how it turns out. Weaver and Hewitt are really good together. They look as if they could actually be mother and daughter. The only good thing a Heartbreakers 2 would bring is these two back together. Nora Dunn, Jeffrey Jones, Ann Bancroft co-star, with a cameo by Carrie Fisher and SNL's Kevin Nealon. If all else fails, you get the great shots of Ms. Hewitt in all her glory. Did I mention how sexy she is?. Our two stars just barely make it work. Just barely.",1009929600,,2242,4.353221957040573

Weaver and Hewitt are mother and daughter con artists who do a 1-2 seduction number on wealthy men for lucrative divorce settlements.  The movie is being compared to ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" but neither Weaver or Hewitt have the comic talents of Steve Martin and Michael Caine.  They also are not at total odds with one another in the story as Martin and Caine were, which gave the Martin-Caine duo more of a comic edge.  Liotta and Hackmann are both targets of these two gold diggers.  I was never convinced that they were so easily able to trick Liotta who plays a crook himself.  Hackmann was more believable as a dupe and had many comedic moments as a tobacco baron who smokes and hacks constantly, seemingly one step away from lung cancer death.  It was fun but leaves no lasting impression.  Need some featherweight entertainment for the night?  This is it.

Heartbreakers is one the most well written comedies to come along in a long time and it is was perfectly cast.  Performances were top notch and hilarious around the horn.

  The men in this film, played gamely by Ray Liotta and Gene Hackman, are supposed to be lecherous guys who can't resist any attractive female who comes their way, making them easy prey for the mother/daughter team of gold-diggers (played by Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver). Sorry, but the ""attractive female turns drooling guy into total idiot"" bit seems a bit lame here, especially since these guys didn't get their money from sheer luck but from using their wits and cunning. And they're going to fall for these two women? Nope, didn't buy that for a minute.
 And then there's Jennifer Love Hewitt, who IS attractive and who can be a decent actress - when given the right role.

This movie may have some good actors in it, but that doesn't make a good movie.  The plot, screenplay, and direction were all completely and unbelievably bad.  This film has no redeeming quality as far as I am concerned.  I am a woman, so I have interest in watching Love Hewitt and Weaver shimmy all over the screen in tight revealing prostitute wardrobes.

(Please take this opportunity to laugh at the grown man wanting to watch a kids movie, but hey, it was Robert Rodriguez.) From the very opening shot of the film, I was drawn in, not because it was funny, but because this film struck me in a different way: It was a visually stunning comedy. It is from beginning to end, shot with expert cinematography; and packed between the bookends of great shots are so many huge laughs that I literally clutched my stomach and fell out of my seat. The whole theater was erupting in constant laughter at this marvel of a comedy that just kept pounding away at your funny bone, not giving you a second to stop and think. This film is so jam-packed with great laughs, yet with a very sweet sentimentality, that I would recommend it so much so as to name it one of the best comedies I've seen in years, which pretty much puts in a secluded list with Kevin Smith films and the ""American Pies."" The main reason for it is because the cast is so wonderful, and we never doubt for a second that all of them are having the time of their lives, making this trifle of a guilty pleasure. Ranging from screen veterans like Sigourney Weaver (most widely known for her Oscar-nominated portrayal of the first woman hero in space, Lt. Ellen Ripley of the ""Alien"" fame), Gene Hackman (do I really need to explain this guy's resume?), and Ray Liotta (with a complete, intact brain, despite his last bad career move), to ""PO5""'s Jennifer Love Hewitt, looking as incredible as ever, and one of my personal favorite actors, Jason Lee, who delivers every line with the precision of a great comic actor.
The film opens during a wedding between the Weaver and Liotta characters, which it turns out, wasn't meant to be, as he no sooner gets out of bed the morning after than he's got his secretary's hair caught in his zipper during some hilarious filandering. The marriage ends with a settlement, of course; somewhere in the neighborhood of $300,000, I believe, and Weaver goes on her way. But we soon find out, much to our shock (that is, if we didn't see the previews), that the skimpy dressed secretary was, in fact, Weaver's daughter, Page (Hewitt). The mother-daughter chemistry between these two here is perfect. If it wasn't, the only way you could've saved this movie was by giving Jason Lee center stage and having him recite the game show scenes of ""Mallrats."" But they didn't have to resort to that: The movie works perfectly without the brilliant Kevin Smith dialogue we're used to Lee spewing with steely perfection because it's got a heart, one that isn't broken by these two con-artists, and it keeps on getting bigger, like the Grinch or something. Anyway, the majority of the film circulates between four plots that all co-exist flawlessly: 1) Regaining the money lost to the IRS by conning a cigarette tycoon name Tensy (Hackman, in one of the most hilariously repulsive roles ever played), 2) A separate, last-ditch effort con between Lee and Hewitt that could actually be real love, 3) The typical ""I'm ready to strike out on my own"" argument between mother and daughter, and 4) The Liotta character's pursuit of Weaver, whom he still loves, despite what happened. All of this is happening at once at certain points in the film, and it would've fallen apart without a good director, and the immense amount of comic energy displayed by the perfect cast. I love this movie, and I've been recommending it to everyone from the moment I stepped out of the theater. If you're in the mood for exhaustingly funny, intelligent/slapstick comedy, this is the movie for anyone with a sense of humor.",1005264000,3,3793,4.62074074074074
1298398,4,B00003CXWM,"This screwball comedy brings together some great dramatic actors in unaccustomed comedic roles.  The results are mixed (but mostly good), with some terrific slapstick and some pure drivel.  Maxine (Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are two very slick con artists who find rich patsies and marry them, only to divorce them for big settlements after enticing them into indiscretions.  When they get nabbed by the IRS for not paying their taxes, they must score one more time to climb out of their financial mess.  The target is chain smoking billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) who is dying before our eyes of lung disease.  The only question is whether Maxine can get him to propose before he keels over.  Meanwhile, Paige is running her own scam on Jack (Jason Lee) who owns a bar resting on prime real estate worth $3 Million.
It is mostly pratfall humor, with lots of sight gags and general nuttiness, which is often uproariously funny.  The whole idea that the diminutive Paige could have been spawned from the Amazonian Maxine is implied comedy at its finest, leading us to conclude that Paige's father could only have been a midget.
Gene Hackman completely steals the show as the wheezy billionaire.  Hackman, who is one of our national treasures as a dramatic actor, shows magnificent range, and he turns out to be the best comedian of the bunch.  Sigourney Weaver is also in rare form brandishing some bodacious outfits and undergarments.  She is especially funny as Olga, trotting out impressive broken English and even doing some vocals accompanied by a Russian balalaika band.  Ray Liotta gives a lighthearted and funny performance as a chop shop owner who can't get over his love for Maxine, even though he knows she scammed him.  Jason Lee's understated nice guy portrayal serves as the perfect counterpart to Jennifer Love Hewitt's bratty vamp.  The perennially cute Hewitt still can't seem to transition into grownup roles.  No matter how sexy they make her up (and they do quite a good job with her considerable attributes), her pubescent mannerisms and delivery still make her come off as a teenage harpy.  In her defense, this is what the role required, but it doesn't do much to move her out of her character rut.
Overall, there is a lot of good fun here that is often dissipated by puerile absurdity.  Still, there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, mostly delivered by Weaver and Hackman, that make this a better than average comedy.  I rated it 7/10.  Fans who like seeing Sigourney and Jennifer in sexy outfits will not be disappointed.",1004832000,,2586,4.905747126436782

1298401,1,B00003CXWM,"I rented this movie with the main reason being that I wanted to see Jennifer Love Hewitt in revealing clothing and acting trashy.  Well I definitely got that, and nothing else.
This is an utterly forgettable movie and halfway through it I was simply fast forwarding to the parts with JLH in skimpy outfits.
Plot:  Standard fare. I feel like I've seen this movie a thousand times before.  Trying to be a clever comedy but with the sweet romantic angle in order to make me care about the leads.  I don't.
Writing:  Awful. The characters are paper-thin.  The jokes are all run of the mill stuff  that seem mildly amusing at times, but never make me laugh out loud.  And the romantic side-plot is totally contrived and seems to be just thrown in because it has to be in this type of movie.
JLH:  Trying her best to act bitchy and lose her good girl image, but doesn't pull it off.
Sigourney Weaver: Was she even in this film? You could have put any number of aging starlets in this role.  She surely didn't do anything with a two-dimensionally written character to give it any depth.
Ray Liotta: Playing your typical comedic-Italian-Mafia stereotype.
Gene Hackman: The only character who was even remotely funny or entertaining.
Jason Lee:  Just getting paid by playing an idiotic bar owner who falls for JLH for no apparent reason other that he enjoys being chastised unmercifully.

1298445,3,B00003CXWM,"heartbreakers is essentially an update on the old dirty rotten scoundrels premise, two grifters (in this case mother and daughter played by weaver and love-hewitt) set about trying to swindel money out of rich old men (hackman).
Weaver acts well and it is good to see her in a comedy again, the only other film i can remember her playing this type of comedic part was in galaxy quest and she seems to have a flair for it, however the plot of the film is really very flimsy and the movie is overly long.
Jason lee is one of my favorite actor's but he has ""one face"" ie he seem's to be typecast in these roles i would like to see him develop more and explore his range, here he reprise's every other role he has had (mallrats, chasing amy etc)and serves as jennifer love hewitt's (fairly decent) love interest.
There are ephemral appearances by carrie fischer and shawn colvin and a nice redemptive ending to serve as the cherry on top of this sugary confectionary. You will laugh occasionally, but if you believe this is the millennium girl power up date of dirty rotten scoundrels you will be disappointed. On the plus side there is some interesting music and gene hackman is on top form as the ailing tobacco baron.

Love Hewitt is extremely witty and funny in his character, the chemistry between the two actresses is amazing. Gene Hackman, as the horribly grosse smoking billionare, is a treat for people who only know him as a serious actor. The bonus material of the DVD is great, specially the outtakes and the making-of featurette. BRAVO!...AWSOME PICTURE!",1003017600,,448,5.323943661971831

1298448,3,B00003CXWM,"I read a movie review in the paper somewhere that made me laugh.  It said ""My only problem with the film is it had too much cleavage.""  Besides both gold digging women discovering they passed up a treasure more valuable, love with a man who really cares for them. The film is about the power of cleavage. So if you are not a guy who wants to drool over Jennifer Love Hewitt in dresses so short you can see the bottom of her panties. Or a woman who enjoys watching powerful moneyed men crumble into tiny piles of crumbs at sight of women in lacy garments, you have no business viewing this movie.
Heartbreakers is about a mother daughter con team. The mother woos and marries the target then the daughter lures him into a compromising position where they are discovered and the two collect a lucrative divorce settlement. Maxine (Sigourney Weaver) pulls a double con on her own daughter to keep her from going off on her own and breaking up the team. Page (Jennifer Love Hewitt) meanwhile works behind her mother's back on a good hearted bartentender/ beach comber who has some property that might be worth some money to some developers. Both get in a little over their heads as former-mark Liotta re-enters the picture and Page comes to realize she is having to fight real feelings for her target.
Hackman is a little too cartoony and some of the situations and motivations feel contrived. But after being immersed in the film for an hour or so you begin to go along with it. Heartbreakers is silly stupid slapstick fun for the first hour and then begins to develop its real story in the last half hour where the characters are allowed to have some real feelings. It takes a while to get going but it will eventually win you over. Not great but its good light entertainment.
There is a director's commentary and some unremarkable outtakes,(JLH stumbling into the trunk of a car with a dead body was kinda cute) but I have to wonder on a feather of a film like this if anyone really cares about the extras.",1002672000,,2005,4.5054945054945055

So watch the movie--but then make sure to watch the DVD voice over commentary by the director, Weaver and Hewitt. They are hilarious. They are totally open, just sitting there and talking, relaying stories about the filming, but also injecting a lot of personal comments.
It's extremely rare to hear such candor and unscripted humor from actreses--especially stars, but these two (and the director) make the voice over a true highlight. It's funny, charming, and add a whole new layer of entertainment.",1002585600,,763,4.922480620155039
1298451,1,B00003CXWM,"I'm absoutely amazed at the plethora of positive reviews of this movie on Amazon because this movie should never be seen by anyone. It's hideous. Yes, it has a good cast and a  promising premise, but a cast and a premise do not a good movie make. In fact, this might be the worst movie I've seen in the entire year of 2001.
This gives the appearance of a fun, light comedy but yet there are no laughs in the entire film. The outcome of every situation will be predicted by the viewer, and/or many of the ""funniest"" situations were seen in the ads for the film. Perhaps it is because the cast members are not really known for their comedic work. The funnest part of watching Heartbreakers ends up being spotting the many celebrity cameos throughout the film.
A high level of coincidence plagues this film as well. Jason Lee's bartender character seems to consistently be in the right place at the right time in order to fall in love with Jennifer Love Hewitt despite her hating him for most of the movie. Doesn't he have a clue? And its hard to swallow when Hewitt's Paige character suddenly develops a conscience towards the end of the film, especially after she has lived a life of con games and tomfoolery under her mother's wing for her entire life. And then when Ray Liotta's character buys into Weaver and Hewitt's act after he's lost half of his material posessions to them? It makes no sense that he's less angry about their ripoff than more willing to join their crew in order to get his money back
The end of the film will be predicted within the first third of the running time and is so unsatisfying you'll be left dumbfounded at the generic quality of it. Who's going to fall in love? If you can't see it coming, you haven't seen many movies.
Yes, this DVD had quite a few extras on it, but the movie was so awful, I didn't even watch them. Twenty deleted scenes is very cool, but if the movie was bad in the first place, why even bother with 20 minutes more footage? If those scenes were cut because they weren't needed or very good, maybe the filmmakers should have taken a look at other scenes in the movie and ask if those were really any better. I can't say enough about this absolutely morose comedy. I would definitely stay away from this movie and I wouldn't watch it again even if I got it for free.",1002585600,5,2320,4.382830626450116
1298452,3,B00003CXWM,"I hesitated about the three star rating, which might imply that this was a good movie.  But is wasn't as horrific as some (like The Wedding Planner), and it was entertaining, if only to enjoy the beauty and charms of Sigourney Weaver, who at 51 is still stunning.
Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt play a mother daughter con team.  Weaver tricks rich men to marry her, then uses her daughter to get the men in a compromising situation so that she can get a hefty divorce settlement.  The scam works well until Weaver winds up scamming Ray Liotta (who gives a one-dimensional performance as a crooked car parts business owner.)  The doofus falls for Weaver and decides to try and win her back.
Weaver meanwhile has gone on to scam a wealthy tobacco billionaire (Gene Hackman in easily his worst role ever) and Hewitt has fallen for a rich bar owner who she jerks around (played by Jason Lee, from ""Almost Famous"" and ""Mumford"".  His role here falls way short of his other efforts). P>The movie also goes through another overused plot device - finding a statue of a naked male and having the penis break off.  Ha Ha.  The Wedding Planner also used this device with equally ineffective results.  Perhaps the filmakers were trying to illustrate what the mother-daughter team does to men.
I will say that at least the movie was entertaining and not a crashing bore, although at slightly over 2 hours, it goes on too long.  There is a neat twist in the end, which redeems things.  All in all, good eye candy and not a total waste of time.",1002499200,4,1530,4.5510948905109485

Hewitt, outfitted in an endless array of low-cut, micro mini-skirt dresses, plays her daughter who then seduces the newly-married grooms giving Weaver grounds for divorce-- and accompanying cash settlement!

Mom has taught her daughter dearest the grift, but little Lolita wants to go legit. Opportunity knocks when the ladies find themselves at a beautiful Florida resort and daughter discovers true romance with the local bartender (Jason Lee, winning personality thoroughly intact). Gene Hackman is hilarious as the smoking addict that Weaver picks as her next project, and Ray Liotta is almost reminiscent of his brilliant work in Something Wild as one of Weaver's previous jobs gone wrong. Featuring some very funny moments, this out of control comedy starts off so right and then squeezes too much into its last third. Hewitt seems promising in her performance at the beginning of the film, but her way-too-sleazy outfits and lack of any comedic timing whatsoever soon destroy what could have been a very charming moment for her.

The film is original, crude and witty with heaps of cool plot twists and a great script that dishes up plenty of laughs and shocks. The performances are superb, with Jennifer Love Hewitt giving the best performance of the film as the sexy, smart daughter of a con woman who follows in her mother's footsteps but inside is really just a young girl looking for the right path in love. Hewitt gives a dazzling show and shows there is more to her ability than running from a hooked hand. Sigourney Weaver's neat turn as naughty mother gives her a much-needed villain character (sure, there's Alien, but we're starting to tire of that!) and Ray Liotta's good-turned-bad character is displayed well by his skills. Liotta is having a good year; Hannibal also really impressed me. Maybe Hewitt's continuous running-away-from-love can be irritating and the film runs too long, but otherwise this is a groovy and entertaining movie with neat ideas.
