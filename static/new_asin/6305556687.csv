1057167,2,6305556687,Very slow story line development.  Unrealistic responses to circumstances often and way too overblown by young George and Derek.  The only part worthwhile was the twist at the end.  But even this was disconnected as there was no reference to when the final solution would have been devised.,1451433600,,290,5.0
1057168,5,6305556687,"Great movie, tense and suspenseful.  I didn't know who Ivan killed until the very end.  But I don't get it.  Why Ivan killed Derek.  Because Derek planned to kill them all?",1449532800,,172,4.451612903225806
1057169,1,6305556687,"Slow story development. Storyline is ridiculous. Poor acting. Unrealistic behavior given the circumstances. I have to bring this one back down to reality. I seriously don't know what people see in this movie, or relate to. It was as cheesy and absurd as it gets. I looked this movie up assuming it was from the early 1980s, but in fact it was made in 1997/98. Incredible.",1449360000,,371,4.636363636363637

1057172,4,6305556687,"Four men committed a horrific crime twenty-two years earlier for which they were never found out. Now, evidence has turned up which has caused the police to investigate. The four meet to determine how they can continue to thwart justice. Mutual recriminations ensue and it quickly becomes every man for himself with shifting alliances. It also becomes apparent that lying to each other began all those years ago. The moral of this story is that people get older not better. This movie is worth watching.",1448236800,,503,4.929411764705883
1057173,5,6305556687,"I love being a Prime member because otherwise I never would have seen this movie.

Four friends reunite 22 years after accidently killing 2 people at a local quarry and then covering it up.  Each has kept that secret (and others), but have continued with their lives until now in the present, the quarry is drained and one of the bodies is found along with the gun used, giving the lead needed to reopen the case.

The story is told in flashbacks as the friends meet in a cabin owned by one of them, as they try to figure out how they are going to deal with the anticipated scrutiny.  Going over the event dredges up the guilt and secrets they have kept all these years which will test their friendship and trust.  It is well told with twists and turns you don't expect right up to the ending, and even then it is not what you think.

Excellent acting, writing, and directing.  Enjoy yourself!",1448150400,,893,4.375757575757576

It's just a gruesome story of 4 teenage boys having a wild night of drinking and had plans to pull a prank on some of their rivals from school and things got WAY OUT OF HAND!!!  Worth watching...Try to really memorize what the names are because the story switches back and forth to teenagers to the present time over 20 years later.....I went back through to make sure I knew who was who, but it was 3 in the am and I wasn't quite with it....

1057341,5,6305556687,"This film was one of the best I've seen of its kind in quite some time. This is a psychological drama about four friends, who 22 years ago unintentionally committed a double homicide and then successfully covered  it up. Now the police have discovered one of the bodies and a gun they can  link to one of the four. The story unfolds as the friends, who haven't  spoken since the event, come together to decide how to handle the  situation. Throughout the drama, the story flashes back to the original  story when they were teenagers, so you really have two suspenseful  interconnected stories unfolding simultaneously.
The film shows the  twisted judgments made by desperate men in a crisis situation. It was  difficult not to be asking oneself, `What would I do in that situation?' I  really only had one plot criticism and that is why did the police not ask  about the destroyed TV set? If you see the film, you will know what I  mean.
The film was excellent in almost every regard. The story was  gripping with numerous plot twists that kept the viewer guessing as to what  would happen next, all the way to the end. The portrayals of these frantic  characters on the brink of distraction, desperately trying to come up with  a solution that would keep them out of jail was riveting. The direction and  photography was very good, without the need for special sets or  effects.
The acting was terrific. Colm Fiore was outstanding as Derek,  the owner of the gun who was being questioned by the police. He plays a  character who is simultaneously terrified, despondent, angry and devious  and switches back and forth between these states flawlessly. David Paymer  gives the best performance I've seen by him to date as the underhanded  lawyer trying to shift blame away from himself. Even Tony Goldwyn, who  often comes off a little stiff, gave an excellent performance.
The  acting by the young cast was also marvelous. It was a commendable job by  casting and director David MacKay to find four actors who resembled the  older actors so much and still had the talent to play their parts so  convincingly. Of these, Marc Worden who played young Ivan was a particualar  standout.
MacKay's best accomplishment was his ability to convincingly  draw the right emotional mix out of the cast. The hand held flight scenes  in the woods were well done and enhanced the dramatic effect. There was one  scene with George (David Paymer) brandishing a hand gun that was done with  a wide angle lens that was a bit amateurish (it made it look like he was  holding a howitzer), but otherwise the camera work was well done with  visual perspectives that enhanced the impact of the scenes.
MacKay's  weaving of the two stories (past and present) in post production was  masterful and kept the film moving at breakneck speed. Just when you needed  an explanation to put some present event in context, there was the next  flashback, as if the director anticipated the questions the viewer was  asking himself.
Overall, this was a taut, well crafted film. It was great  to see a low budget independent film with so much entertainment value. I  gave it a 9/10. Hunt it down and find it. You won't regret it.",955929600,5,3189,4.704710144927536
