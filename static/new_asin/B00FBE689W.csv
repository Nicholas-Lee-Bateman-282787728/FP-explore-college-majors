5974063,5,B00FBE689W,"So much in this series is astonishing, astounding and absorbing. Regardless of what one believes, you will be pushed to go very deep to explain away the phenomena studied. Not every episode is as spell-binding as the other, but all present enigmas. I find myself thinking about what I've just seen long after watching it. Talk about conversation starters! Stuff like this should be taught to kids from elementary through high school in order to teach them to think and to arouse their curiosity.

I read about the mystery of Oak Island when I was sick age 9. It started a life-long quest for the unexplained. I'm now in my 70's.",1395187200,8,628,4.657657657657658

5974084,1,B00FBE689W,"Waste of my time. I have all the ancient aliens season 1-6 on DVD and I was looking to get my boyfriend something new  since its not time for a new season. I knew it would be old episodes, hoping it would be ""the best of"" different episodes like it says. That's not the case. They literally took a DVD from season two and a DVD from season 3 and put them in the box. It even says season 2 and 3 in the main menu. They didn't put the best together. I'm disappointed, we love the show, but that's cheap.",1419552000,31,501,3.9603960396039604

of the world around us so if we see anything like it government has deniability",1399161600,,182,3.8157894736842106
5974095,3,B00FBE689W,"Kind of a fun watch the first time though, but then it becomes silly when you notice all the ridiculous things the ""authors"" state.  Yes, most of these people are ""authors"" not valid scientists in any fashion.
My favorite is how ancient aliens travel 100,000 light years and use ""rockets"" to land?!?  Yeah the ""author's"" on this claim that all the time.  And the same Ancient Aliens looks like us and could ""breed with our girls"".
It makes you think a bit and wonder how the heck the Ancient Humans could do such things, but there is more fiction here than science.",1398902400,,565,4.519607843137255

8614019,5,B00FBE689W,"Where did it all start\?  No one really knows for sure. How were the early cities and monuments built?  By who?  Anyone who does not think we were visited by aliens from another space location, probably still believes in Easter Bunny and Santa Clause. How were those heavy 50 to 200 ton perfectly cut stones moved and placed for the walls and buildings.  A book titled ""Chariots of the gods"" was written almost 50 years ago around 1970 which I bought it and could not put it down.  Too many unexplained mysteries of events that happened thousands of years ago. Egypt, Mexico, Peru,  Easter Island and other places around this planet that remain unexplained.
Who were they?  What did they want?  Why did they help us? why did they leave? Will they return?
This Movie series may supply some thought of these questions.  What do you think???",1529193600,,838,4.64625850340136

8614024,1,B00FBE689W,"First off $5 isn't much of a loss, but still this was a waste of money. I was mislead that this set of dvd's was some sort of compilation of footage put in a strategic order to make it like a movie style or documentary style. Not the case with this what-so-ever. This DVD collection contains Disc 1 ""Season 2"" Episodes 5-8  and on Disc 2 ""Season 3"" Episodes 5-8. I literally have all the episodes from all the seasons with Xfinity on demand and this just was a total waste of money and time.",1489968000,5,491,4.168421052631579
