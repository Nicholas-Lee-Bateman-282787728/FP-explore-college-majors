The video itself was very grainy, exactly like watching an old movie at the movie theatre.  Color was not sharp, more like fuzzy.  Subtitles were unreadable in many scenes (because wording was white over light areas in the scene), and were in fact, totally missing in one section of the film, and I had to guess what the lead characters were talking about.  My guess is, that this is a copy of a videotape someone made of the movie shown on tv. I know this was a very old movie, but I still thought the stunts were more hokey than a lot of Old Chinese Movies I've seen.  I've been watching Kung Fu Movies for more than 50 years, now, and normally, I'm not a very critical person, but this was not even a fair movie.  I would not recommend buying this.",1393804800,,870,4.204819277108434
