8046599,1,B0007CEX18,"This has not helped at all, she talks through most of it without any good information. Half the time it seems like she pauses to think of what she was saying in the first place cause she's making it up as she goes. There were no positions that as a woman I wouldn't have figured out on my own or used during my first labor. There were a total of about 4 positions in this entire DVD. I expected much much more. My husband was excited about doing these with me since we are having a home birth but was nearly as disappointed as I was. The only good points were showing us the points to push on the hips and lower back but that wasn't worth the time and money spent on this DVD.",1319760000,,676,4.014814814814815
8046600,5,B0007CEX18,"My husband is a lovely affectionate sort of person, but had virtually no instincts about how to make a person in pain feel better. Rocki's video was perfect for us- it gave him concrete, hands-on suggestions, with easy to follow instructions.  She suggested things I wouldn't have thought of, or been able to explain half as well. It was highly recommended to me, and I am delighted with it.  Better than birthing class!",1229385600,,420,4.739726027397261
8046601,4,B0007CEX18,"This isn't so much as a workout video as it is an instructional video.  This is really a guide for how to accomplish workouts.  I think there is decent material in this video for methods that can be used for easing the labor process, but I think that the video is a bit short.  In fact, I see no reason that Volume 2 and 3 could not be on the same disc.  For that reason, I can't give this a higher rating.  If this disc had been arranged in such a way that workout parts could be accomplished, then it would be fully worth it, but noting that all it does is explain the various positions and does not go through as a ""workout video"", it falls short of its purpose.",1143244800,3,665,4.0458015267175576
8046602,5,B0007CEX18,"I got this DVD because I love Rocki's Prenatal Yoga routine so much. I'm really glad I did. She has a ton of information about how movement and breathing affect the baby during labor and ways to get more comfortable. I've actually gotten my husband to do this with me and as corny as it sounds, it's really given us some time to get closer. He now knows what I like and want during labor and I think we'll work better together as a team. Thanks, Rocki.",1124323200,8,452,4.206896551724138
8046603,5,B0007CEX18,"I've told every one of my pregnant friends to get this DVD--it was SO helpful for my delivery. It really helped me focus on what worked for me and what didn't. After practicing the positions, we knew when labor started that I liked this pose and not that one. When I started to freak out during labor, my hubby helped bring me back by suggesting a position. I love that it gets your husband involved in the labor process. (He has more to do that just hand you ice chips and say ""good job!"") My husband really got into the exercises--he said it made him feel more of a partner than an assistant. Invaluable!",1124236800,4,606,4.324561403508772
8046604,5,B0007CEX18,"We'd taken a Bradley class with my first baby and it didn't do much for me. I got this for my second and what a huge difference! I used so many things she teaches on the DVD-breathing, different poses, movement. The last hour before I started pushing was me moving my hips with my husband massaging my back-and I'm convinced that's why it only took 2 pushes for my son to be born. Rocki really seems to know alot about childbirth and her techniques helped me immeasurably. Great DVD. (I feel the same way about the next one in the series-Labor Prep 3.)",1123545600,5,552,4.368932038834951
8046605,3,B0007CEX18,"everything you learn here is exactly what you';; learn at the classes you take with your first pregnancy. i don't think it was helpful for my husband or i with our second pregnancy. i think a post pregnancy yoga dvd would probably be better for you. and besides, it's hard to do the yoga dvd when you have a 2 year old running around the house.",1122336000,,344,4.2272727272727275
