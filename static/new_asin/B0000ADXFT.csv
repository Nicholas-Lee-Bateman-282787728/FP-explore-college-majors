7996793,5,B0000ADXFT,This is a good movie.  Has to do with a  escaped Cyborg.  He is programed  to be like a  cop.  Very good premise.,1469923200,,113,3.6956521739130435
7996794,4,B0000ADXFT,"I thought the movie was not bad, the negative reviews are from people that just hate Corey Feldman, anyway take a look at this film some people will find it very enjoyable. Especially action fans. As far as the name of the movie [Storm Troopers], I don't see what the storm has anything to do with the action and the cyborg in thi movie.",1136332800,,337,4.28125
7996795,1,B0000ADXFT,"This has to be the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time!!  Dumb plot, horrendous acting, atrocious continuity, lame special effects, and unbelievable characters.  Examples: Non-Cyborg wounds that scar over in minutes, without any medical attention at all.  Elite mercenary henchmen with laser sights on their rifles, yet they are only able to shoot furniture and microwave ovens.  Characters that fail to hear their buddies getting shot up in the next room.  Windows that get shot out during a storm, but are completely intact for the next gun battle (only to be shot out again).  Depressed, mousey wife who, suddenly, at the end of the movie has turned into ninja-like Sarah Conner, expert marksman, demolitions expert, and expert motorcyclist (as indicated by riding off into a thundering downpour, guns everywhere, and without a helmet).  The final laugh, during the credits, is written ""An Extra special thank you to Madame Zolta-Reader/Advisor"".  They had a psychic who couldn't see how bad this movie was turning out!!?  Not a very good psychic!",1136160000,6,1057,5.1345029239766085
