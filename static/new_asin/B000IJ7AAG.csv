8145967,1,B000IJ7AAG,"This set of four DVDs is near worthless. First of all, each DVD is short, shows no effort at research or history, and has not one single expert interviewed.

Disc title: CLASSIC TRAVEL TRAILERS
  A scant 36 minutes. One interview of a classic trailer restorer. He is a nice guy, but can give little info on the subject. No research by the film maker, so plan to know nothing more about classic trailers than you already know. The last 10 minutes is music playing and old pictures of ads of trailers.

Disc title: CUSTOM CAR SHOW
  47 minutes long. Better than the first disc, but still this is just pictures of some cars and interviews with about 3 owners. The pictures of the cars are fun, but again the cheap film makers only visit one show, and our tour guide has nothing interesting to say, and more than half of the time is spent playing background music with camera pans of the cars.

Disc title: Classic Chevrolets
  52 minutes. Here again only one car show of Chevrolets is visited, and the tour guide is a young pretty girl who knows nothing at all about the cars, so for 90 percent of the 52 minutes, bad music is played and no one speaks. I turned the sound down but made it through the 52 minutes. All I saw was mid 1950's Chevys. No research, no history, no info, and worst of all, no early Chevys of the 30's and 40's or cars past 1959. Someone just took a video camera to a car show and filmed a few of the chevys, and probably hired their daughter or niece to come along and be the hostess and then dubbed in some music that was not under copyright.

Disc title: KINGS OF CUSTOMIZING
  44 Minutes. As boring and uninformative as the first 3 discs.

All four of these discs could have been combined into one disc----BUT IT WOULD STILL BE A RIPOFF AND BORING. Save your money...this set will tell you nothing and will probably just make you angry that you wasted your money. I will never buy another product put out by this company.",1249603200,,1946,4.342541436464089
