1663905,4,B00005U8R7,"If you are looking for a non-aggressive but energizing workout go for this one. I have a very bad back problem so I select exercise routines that help me to work out without straining my back. The AM workout is very energizing and the PM workout certainly helps to unwind. When you do the workouts just remember to focus on your mind and body - you will enjoy these workouts as much as I do. Scott Cole does a good job of explaining the body points that these workouts energize, so you know where to focus your mind as you are moving your body.",1090972800,12,544,4.240384615384615
1663906,5,B00005U8R7,"This dvd is great. It is my first tai chi dvd. I had never done tai chi before, so I was as 'beginner' as you can get. Scott Cole is very clear in his instruction, but not so much that you get caught up with trying to figure out if what you are doing is correct. There is nice music playing in the background. I was able to close my eyes and really feel the relaxing effects of tai chi the very first time. I have since purchased ""Scott Cole's Discover Tai Chi for Beginners - Workout Essentials"". I am looking forward to more from Scott Cole. Two thumbs up!!",1090800000,10,559,4.090909090909091
1663907,5,B00005U8R7,"My only introduction to Tai Chi was what I saw in ""The Calendar Girls"" movie, so I was a rank beginner when I bought this DVD.  Because of bad knees, I was unable to do Yoga, so decided to try this out.
Scott is a wonderful teacher and I was able to follow along right from the beginning.  I've used the DVD, morning & night, for 4 weeks, and have noticed a great deal of improvement in muscle tone in back, abs and especially the knees.  They are stronger and no longer have that annoying tendency to buckle on stairs. I am overweight, btw, and unlike Yoga, this does not present a problem with doing this type of exercise.  Hope these comments helps someone make the decision to buy . . .",1088121600,33,690,4.204545454545454
1663908,4,B00005U8R7,"Some reviewers harshly criticize Scott Cole as a fraud.  But as far as I'm concerned,  he teaches the principles of tai chi very well.  I suppose the main objection of some is the ""Americanization"" of the art of tai chi.  But it is still an excellent program that relaxes, strengthens, stretches and centers.  That's good enough for me.  I tried other tai chi videos and they were too complicated or fast, even if they are labelled beginner.",1063152000,7,441,4.662337662337662
1663909,1,B00005U8R7,"Scott Cole has no background or formal training in Tai Chi at all. He is actually a fitness instructor, as his bio states, but he presumes to call himself a master. Go figure. The reason this video is hard to follow is not because you should have a background in tai chi before watching it. It's hard to follow because the author doesn't know tai chi well enough to teach it. Save your money for reputable teachers like Liang Shou-yu or Yang Jwing-ming.",1032998400,10,453,4.469879518072289
1663910,2,B00005U8R7,"While Scott Cole may a leading expert in Tai Chi, I found this video lacking (I also purchased the AM Workout). The moves are demonstrated in his studio. There is only 1 camera angle - directly in front of him. The moves are not explained in detail, rather he does the move while telling you about it. He then goes on to the next move. I am very new to all of this and would rather have it repeated a few times in the beginning as well as a camera shot behind him so I can compare my body stance with his.
This video would be better suited to someone who is familar with Tai Chi and the moves to create a nice routine or add to one you already do.",1028332800,14,647,3.946564885496183
1663911,4,B00005U8R7,"I have taken tai chi at 3 different times in my life from teachers with vastly differing styles.  One was quietly meditational, another more dance oriented (he was a ball-room dance instructor) and the last was a martial arts instructor who taught a strict, rigid class that I survived for about 2 months.  That was 12 years ago and I havn't done much in the way of exercise since.  Now as part of a get-healthy-before-I-die program, I picked up the video cassette of Discover Tai Chi PM.
It was a very nice surprise.  I had never heard of Scott Cole but his vital,cheery aproach to Tai Chi was very accessible and easy to follow.  He gave an adequate amount of information about the philosohical basics (it is after all an exercise/health tape and not a Taoist teachings video :-} ) and it was incorporated into the exercises them selves.  The movements flow nicely and are repeated several times in the  introductory segments.  They are then tied together into a form of sorts and repeated at the end over some above average New Age meditation music.
Cole is  quite  energetic, easy going and appears to really enjoy the act of teaching.  And he has a pleasant voice that is easy to understand.
Now for the really important information.  I feel great every time I do this work out: energized and relaxed at the same time.  It was the perfect relaxation tape for this sedentary, moderately stressed out, over weight (but decreasing...finally) 40-something female.  It would probably be best to have some familiarity with tai chi, although it is by no means  necessary.  It was for that reason (my perception that a certain amount of basic knowledge was assumed) and the fact that Sensei is still in my head barking at me to do the form seriously and correctly, that I gave the tape 4 stars.  For sheer enjoyment and effectiveness, I'd give it 5.
The DVD format would be great as it is easier to find specific segments and more forgiving of endless replays.",1028073600,167,1957,4.658892128279883
1663962,5,B00005U8R7,"Some people might say that this isn't classical Tai Chi.  They're right, it's not.

This is better.  It's the perfect way to get stiff, overweight Americans off the sofa and moving in a way that's easy, fun and welcoming.

That's Scott Cole's real genius.  The way he presents his programs are just so smooth and inviting that you're getting into them before you even realize what you're doing.

One big benefit of his teaching style is that you can do the whole thing in a very tiny space, which is perfect for today's cramped apartment dwellers who never have enough room for the classic Tai Chi forms.

Another is his totally non-judgmental attitude.  He goes out of his way to give people the freedom to adapt to their own body and not expect everyone to do everything exactly the way he does it.  He encourages flexibility not conformity, movement not rigidity.

His programs may seem deceptively simple, but after a while you start to realize that you're moving in ways you never thought possible, flexing parts of your body in ways you haven't done since high school....and maybe not even then.  Best of all, the improvement is progressive.  Not matter where you start from, you very quickly notice the difference in the way you feel and the way you move.  You can keep growing and expanding without ever feeling like you've reached the limit of what you can achieve.

I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  Five years ago I shattered my right knee cap and never thought I could do any real exercise again.  But I can do this!!  And if I can do it with a knee that's still held together with titanium wire, well, that should say it all right there.

If you want to feel better than you have in years, get Scott's programs.  You will never regret it.",1191196800,3,1762,4.5015772870662465
1663963,3,B00005U8R7,"After only a few sessions watching this video, I was bored with it. Scott is not a very compelling instructor.",1188518400,,110,4.55

1663966,5,B00005U8R7,What I like most about this DVD is the fact that you can perform either of the routines in as little as 15 minutes or as long as you wish.  The routines are easy and fun to learn.  Most importantly you will feel good both physically and mentally upon completion of the AM or PM workout.  The movements are free and flowing like the rhythm of nature.  I enjoy practicing my routines outside in the cool morning and evening breezes.  It is definitely worth the money and time.,1173312000,4,474,4.340909090909091
1663967,5,B00005U8R7,"This instructional dvd is as practical as it is FUN. It is great for  beginners as well as the more advanced.  The workouts are low impact enough for a novice to do them with ease, yet you sweat!  To my surprize, I got a good workout.  But the best part of it was I actually felt energized at the end of the work out instead of exausted.  This dvd is worth the money.",1163376000,2,367,3.9726027397260273
1663968,5,B00005U8R7,I find these workouts to be very helpful and most enjoyable.  Mr. Cole is an able teacher.  His manner is quiet and his explanations of the various postures/moves are exact.  He makes me feel as if I do not need to become an expert immediately--and that is important to me as I am not naturally athletic or particularly limber.  The evening workout helps me to relax after a mind bending day at work.,1154908800,5,400,4.438356164383562
1663969,3,B00005U8R7,"I  was really looking forward to this. After being out of the ""Tai Chi"" loop for awhile , I thought this would be a logical comeback program. Having some prior experience beforehand I found the rather loose casual approach slightly dis-jointing to the more informative and ""Form Insight"" style of past instruction. As a videographer. I also found the production style distracting-ie: straight cuts verses dissolves & shot changes that didn't co-incide with the narrative. I just self ""re-edited"" the instruction I liked  with my own narrative down to short segments. Too bad , I liked Scotts casual air; I just wish it had been mixed with a bit more structure.",1154131200,6,660,4.936936936936937
1663970,5,B00005U8R7,"My chiropractor kept telling me to take up tai chi as a way loosen up joints -- my lifestyle consists mostly of sitting, standing, and working out on machines at the gym, something that involves a limited range of motion. I took an introductory course on tai chi some years ago, but I found it very elaborate, tedious, and frankly just boring. I was reluctant to take up tai chi as it seemed like something that would entail a great deal of time and effort to learn.  Then I came across Scott Cole's A.M/P.M. workout and it has been a Godsend.  While tai chi purists may scoff at his pragmatic approach, I am grateful his tai chi program is readily accessible and easy to do.  Those new to tai chi can start immediately by following Scott's instructions for his 15-minute morning and evening workouts.  The emphasis is on just doing the movements and not worrying about being exacting and precise.  I immediately started feeling more supple after using this DVD, which I now do each day. I may look into the more elaborate tai chi styles in the future, but for now Scott Cole's tai chi workouts fit into my lifestyle and make a positive difference in my body's functioning.",1153008000,11,1173,4.566666666666666
1663971,5,B00005U8R7,"I have viewed various Tai Chi videos, but not until Scott Coles' Discover Tai Chi for Beginners, was I able to pull it all together. From other videos I learned a little of this and a little of that, but from watching Scott's video, I was finally able to get the flow of the movements blending together and gradually incorporate leg and foot movements along with the arm and hand flow.

Scott does show a lot in this video, but you can digest it at your own pace. With each viewing you become aware of more fine-tuning that you're able to apply to your form and movement.  He has it all there for you to absorb at your own pace.  Learning through mirroring his image as he faces us makes it much easier for me.  I found that at one point when the camera shifted behind him that I lost my sense of direction and I became disoriented in not being able to mirror exactly what he was doing. But this was an isolated occurrence in the video, which made me aware of how much I rely on the mirroring.

The video also had excellent continuity.  The camera would take you from outdoors and back to the studio (or vice versa) and he would be continuing the flow of the movement at the exact position where he was at the previous location. This is an excellent quality video.

With Scott Cole's video, I have become totally addicted to Tai Chi. Finally as a beginner, I am able to pull it all together.  I am 58 and have done Bikram Yoga for 8 years, and have now incorporated some Tai Chi into my twice weekly 90-minute yoga routine.  And, I now make time for 15-45 minute Tai Chi several times a week.  Since doing Tai-Chi with Scott's video, I have noticed an increased strength and stability in my legs, knees and ankles, not to mention a strong awareness to increased energy and energy flow.

I'll be looking forward to checking out the next level by Scott in the near future.  At present I'm still getting plenty of use out of this Beginner's tape.  By the way, I would have given this 6 stars if that was one of the choices.

Just call me ""Tai Chi Rose"" of Chicago, IL...",1144454400,5,2067,4.293814432989691
1664022,1,B00005U8R7,"What can I say other than a fitness model waving his or her arms around is not Tai Chi.  Although the background and music is nice, even a novice Tai Chi practicioner could discern that Mr. Cole has little understanding of even the basics principles of Tai Chi. I should have realized that this DVD was nothing more than an exercise in marketing when I saw his other title, Tai Chi for weight loss. If you are looking for real Tai Chi or qigong, stay very far away from this workout.",1141344000,9,483,4.3076923076923075

1664025,5,B00005U8R7,"Scott Cole's Discover Tai Chi AM & PM Workouts is the best I have found so far, and I have a box full of tai chi videos that I consider mostly useless. This one is not for the purist - it is a series of tai chi moves without adherence to a rigid ""form."" Just a really good and satisfying tai chi workout for old hands as well as beginners. . . and with no long explanations as you stand around and do nothing while the instructor listen to himself talk . . . and talk.

Best of all, there is no right-left confusion. The producers realize that you are watching a mirror image, so they refer to left when you see left and right when you see right (even though to Scott, the sides are actually reversed). I heartily thank them for this, having watched many routines in which the instructor turns (more than once) and you don't know which side is which or which end is up.

The production values are good, and simple - there are no fake waterfalls, hokie roar of ocean waves, or elaborate sets. There are simple studio shots and simple beach shots. The music is there but not distracting. There is no entourage of students, so we can spend our time watching the master, who is a pleasure to watch! Tai chi has great beauty, especially when performed by an expert such as Scott Cole!

I have a feeling my box of previous tai chi workouts will go the way of amazon marketplace or the local free store.

Thanks Scott and all of you who are responsible for this thoughtful presentation!!",1125273600,47,1480,4.31294964028777

1664030,5,B00005U8R7,"As I review this dvd i had just received it yesterday and was able to do the PM session last night and woke up with the AM session today.

After completing the easy to follow (yet not too remedial)session last night, i didn't want to do anything else but lay in bed and have a wonderful nights sleep. It was very relaxing and made me feel like i had gotten a full body massage, freeing up every joint in my body. It was a great way to end the day and relieve stress.

As i woke up with the AM session today i found that my mind was clear and body ready to face whatever comes my way today. I looked forward to getting going and didn't need coffee to jump-start my workday. This is a wonderful addition to my day. and after only two sessions, i know i'll be hooked.

I certainly am rusty as far as following the movements, but the pace and instruction is perfect and doesnt leave me confused or frustrated as i learn and follow the movements.

As i get more comfortable, i know that i will do well by continuing to explore the other dvds from this series.",1103068800,11,1054,4.151960784313726
1664031,4,B00005U8R7,"Hello,
I have several Tai Chi tapes, but this is the one I play the most. I really like the morning and evening exercises. They are easy and the morning rountine leaves me energized and the evening one helps me relax and sleep well. The background is a beach in Hawaii which is calming to study while you exercise. Besides the instructional section, there is a section that has Scott lead you in the rountines to music without instruction. These run around 15 minutes which I can handle when I am too rushed to do anything else. There is also a meditation excercise which is also short, but relaxing.
In content and layout, this is a five star DVD. The only reason that I give it four stars is because there is a defect in the DVD. I don't remember which section--but it is midway through one of the instructional sections. The DVD freezes up and stops there and you have to exit the DVD and come in through the menu again to get to the other parts. However, the routine is also done to music without instruction--so I have been using that section instead. There was this flaw on the first copy I bought of this CD--so I took it back and it was exchanged for a new copy, and it has the same flaw. I just kept the second copy and have been working around it because even with the defect--it is my favorite Tai Chi tape.
I even took Tai Chi lessons for four months and learned a 108 routine and it certainly helped my body get in shape--but it is difficult to remember all the moves or have time to do them when you only have 15 minutes in the morning, when you are still groggy, or 15 minutes in the evening when you are exhausted.
Scott's moves are easy to follow--even for the brain dead--and they work anyway. :)
May 15, 2007 Update--I'm still using this DVD and enjoying it. Even when I've been sick or lazy and have strayed from excercise--I always start back with this to build me up for other excercise. :)

I plan to keep the extra copy to give to friends to try to convince them to follow Scot Cole's Tai Chi DVD's.  The PM workout cures any lower backache I have from sitting at the computer.  It's excellent for improving balance and flexibility.  It's a slow, gentle routine that anyone can do.  I like that each routine is about 35-minutes.  Short enough for when I don't have a lot of time, but long enough to work!

I've been doing Tai Chi using Scott Cole's DVD's for almost two years now. When I first started, I was surprised that I couldn't sit cross legged, since I always could as a kid!  I just couldn't bend that way.  But after only four weeks of doing Tai Chi, I could sit on the floor cross legged.  My flexibility and balance have improved.  I also notice that I've lost inches in my waist.

After using several different instructional DVD's for Tai Chi, I still like all of them and continue to use each lesson depending on what I feel I need on a given day. Scott Cole's instruction of AM/PM Tai Chi routines is pretty easy to follow. His style or form of Tai Chi seems like the least traditional to me of the 3 instructors that I use in my exercises.
