3705582,1,B001N26GVG,The other people writing reviews on this movie must be in the moive.  Looks like it was filmed by a 12 year old.  There is nothing good I can say about this terrible film.,1266364800,9,171,4.0
3705583,4,B001N26GVG,Great fun from start to finish.  Just enough gore and lots of zombie violence.  It's a must have for all zombie fans.,1266364800,5,117,4.2727272727272725
3705584,4,B001N26GVG,"I ordered Zombie Apocalypse on a whim, and to be honest, I wasn't expecting great things. I didn't recognize any of the names, and it sort of looked just like another dumb straight-to-DVD horror flick.

In actuality, what I got was a fairly well-done zombie movie, with just the right amount of action, gore, and camp. The movie is reminiscent of the 80's, when low budgets weren't a problem, because the story was interesting and compelling enough to not need them. That being said, I was pretty impressed with the blood spatter, as well as all the zombie violence.

So, yeah, I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, because if nothing else, it's a LOT of fun. It's much better than many of the straight-to-DVD set, though the production cost was obviously low. Zombie Apocalypse has its flaws, but a lack of character and action is absolutely not one of them.",1266364800,9,859,4.644736842105263
3705585,5,B001N26GVG,"One can tell from the start this film was a labor of love for all involved.  It's amazing what can be done with near no budget when the filmakers, crew and actors are obviously enjoying themselves.

Filmed on location entirely in West Michigan and using all local crew and actors, this film is one fun ride from start to finish.  Alot of classic drive in movie style with a new twists thrown in for good measure.

Get the popcorn and sodas, sit back and enjoy the show.",1266364800,3,469,4.35632183908046
3705586,5,B001N26GVG,"This movie is amazing!  I cant believe that it diddn't have a big budget production, because this is zombie action at its finest!!",1263427200,4,130,4.6521739130434785
3705587,4,B001N26GVG,"No budget...? No problem!!

ACTING: As with the usual low / no budget indies, the expectations for oscar worthy performances are pretty low. The cast of Zombie Apocalypse was a nice surprise. While there are a few actors that may want to consider other career choices (or at least, some acting lessons) pretty much everyone held their own and it was clear that they had fun doing it.

PRODUCTION: Another pleasant surprise. This is one of those films that realizes it doesn't have millions of dollars at its disposal and embraces it. The script is pretty good considering it originally was separate episodes meshed together into a full length feature (I did notice a few things continuity-wise and plot-wise that vanished thanks to the meshing). The sound production and background music is great, the make up, blood & gore is pretty good and the special effects aren't bad.

ZOMBIES: The good, the bad and the ugly! The make up for the zombies was really good. The zombies were the usual eclectic bunch. Walkers, runners, shamblers, they're all here. One thing that caught my attention was at first the zombies need to have their brains destroyed to be stopped, then later, it seems anything goes as a way to destroy the zombies.

THE CAUSE: Not really clear about this. Some sort of infection.

NUDITY: None.

FINAL: Overall, what can I say? This was a fun, action packed zombie adventure. It would be nice to see what the director and his production team could do with some serious cash. I hope that a distributor picks this up as it deserves to be seen and enjoyed by all of us zombie aficionados and those just looking for for an action filled adventure.

3705620,3,B001N26GVG,"A good low-budget zombie flick, it was entertaining. Most of the acting was adequate, none was above par. I love the fact that most of this was filmed in actual places and green/blue screened. It is refreshing to see a movie that is not filmed in the usual Hollywood soft-focus. Not an oscar winner, but most films aren't. The main character spoke with a gravelly voice most of the movie, then at the end he spoke with a mild Hispanic accent, I am not sure if he was trying to imitate Christopher Lambert or Ricardo Montalban. If you really like zombie movies you might like this, as long as your expectations are not that high. There are a bunch of cliches and humour in this movie, plus 'homage' to other movies. It's better than the one star average it has.",1448409600,,760,4.435714285714286

3705718,1,B001N26GVG,"One star... only because zero stars isn't an option. Totally cheesy B-movie here - there is a plot, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, it's full of contradictions (like... why would a survivor group broadcast an invitation to survivors, and then capture, roughhouse and then cage the people who respond to the invite? Why does the ""world's best at eluding capture"" expert spy guy keep allowing unskilled civilians to follow him into abandoned houses and other potential traps? And, the guy who is chasing this expert spy - why does he seem to have NO contact with the zombies, how does he just stroll through the wilderness and arrive at the exact location of the guy he's pursuing (with absolutely no indication that he's doing anything specific toward ""following a trail"" (assuming that the expert spy guy was leaving any trail.. considering the alleged ""expertise"" at eluding capture, wouldn't the existence of a trail be irrefutable evidence that the pursuer isn't following the right guy??)) How does a med school dropout end up being the (SURPRISE!!) leader of the paramilitary survivor group - wouldn't it be smarter to utilize whatever he DID learn in med school, by giving him a paramedic role and having someone with military experience (like, say, our expert spy guy..) serve as the leader of the zombie defense? Why does the climactic fight scene look like it was choreographed by John Belushi??)  There are more holes in this script, than in all of the zombies killed here put together. This could be viewed as a kind of ""Quest Story"" - a journey toward a goal (here, the survivor compound and survival) where the journey is symbolic of the protagonist's journey toward redemption, personal growth, something noble or profound... but not here. Add terrible acting.. obvious, cartoonish digital effects.. the (IMDb estimated) $5,000 budget.. the lack of any (standard in the zombie genre) humor.. and Amazon should have paid ME to waste this hour and a half watching this turd.

A man in handcuffs is set upon by a group of zombies, which we later find out were produced by the government, unless you read the comic book. Meanwhile Tom and Mark decide they want to go out for a drink, but like a trip to White Castle they get detoured.

There is also Raven, ""don't call me Jennifer"" who is a punk-goth looking photographer. She joins the group. As fate would have it these 4 end up together. We find out the man in cuffs is some kind of government agent who was supposed to have been killed by the zombie attack. Mark has issues with his former roommate Kevin, who is sleeping with his gf, or ex-gf. Kevin looks like a young Val Kilmer.

The movie has some real bad acting, like the bouncer at the bar who has ""SECURITY"" on his t-shirt. Fortunately the worse actors get eaten early. There seems to be a serious lack of guns for rural Michigan. There is one scene with some comical Dr. Evil diabolical laughter. The zombies are of the slow moving variety with a lousy make-up job.

3705743,4,B001N26GVG,"I may be the only reviewer who really liked ""Zombie Apocalypse"" - and needed no brew to help me form that opinion.  It's a terrific movie.  I've totally given up going by Amazon reviews for zombie movies - for other kinds of movies, especially sci-fi, the reviews are usually right on; but for zombie movies they're usually a million miles off the mark.  This movie was well made - I could see that from the very first scene.  It was dark, foreboding, dramatic and immediately piqued my interest.  That opening scene introduced both the main character - the action hero who dominated the movie - and his mysterious nemesis, who only re-emerged briefly about half way through then, finally, came to dominate the wrap-up.

""Zombie Apocalypse"" was in some ways a zombie comedy as well as a traditional fight and flight flick.  But the comedy wasn't in your face funny; it was more subtle.  The action hero, who looked and sounded Hispanic, was named Dwight Miller - about as far from an action hero's name as from an Hispanic name.  The chick, named Raven, who eventually came to be the movie's heroine, started out as an airhead whose greatest concern was capturing the zombies on film - not the standard video film but regular point-and-shoot camera pictures, which she planned to work into a montage once this zombie attack was over.  Of course, she didn't realize then that zombie attacks are never over.  The two college guys, named Tom and Mark, were a kind of Felix and Oscar Odd Couple, the rational one always asking how doing such-and-such a stupid thing would help the situation.  Eventually, Dwight, Raven and the two college guys worked their way to a haven of survivors - led, not by a tough military man named Bull or Rope or Sarge but by a kid named Kevin - the very college freshman, in fact, who stole Mark's girlfriend.

The climax of the movie was the inevitable fight to the death between Miller and his nemesis, named only Net.  The fight sequence was well staged, if a bit over-drawn, with Net first running Miller through with his own machete then pulling out one of his eyes.  But, not to worry, his wounds weren't fatal; but his fighting days, alas, were about over.

Another thing just right about the movie was the music; and, as mentioned, the atmosphere - dark, creepy and, of course, heavily wooded - was perfect for a zombie movie.  And, as with any good zombie movie, the ending was ambiguous.  I'm sorry reviewers, but this was a really good movie.",1313884800,13,2479,4.646788990825688

there scene that will remind of dawn of the dead, day of the dead and land of the dead.  i would recommend this movie if you like your movies independent.  plus the dvd comes with a mini comic that gives you a sort prequel of the story that unfolds on the dvd.  comic was created by the director/writer of the movie. so if the movie making business is not successful. he always has a future in comics.",1288137600,2,535,4.2254901960784315

Save your money and skip this one, it wouldn't be worth watching even if it were free.

I work in the film business been it for over 12 yrs and I have even shot my own shorts. 90 percent of the acting is horrible, the script feels like it was a really bad rip off of resident evil mixed with return of the living dead and all the good parts were taken out. I can understand trying to shoot something with a low budget, but this is beyond horrible. The reviews that said it was a good movie had to be written by people who worked on the movie. Either that or their family and friends. I have seen low budget zombie and horror movies that look 1000 times better then this. I think they spent most of their budget on fog machines and fog juice....there is a fan trailer of Left for Dead on you tube which blows this movie away...",1266710400,12,825,4.098765432098766

But if you anticipate what was clearly below ""low budget""...then you're going to enjoy it.

I've seen far, far worse zombie flicks than this with much greater budget backing them...worse plot, terrible acting, and far less convincing special effects. This particular film was a breath of fresh air, being as truly bad as it was while still being damn entertaining.

I'm just pleased that the distributor didn't attempt to promote a blu-ray release, because that would have been less than useless.",1266537600,7,578,5.063157894736842

8322910,3,B001N26GVG,"At one time Zombie Apocalypse occupied my list as the worst zombie film ever made. However, I eventually decided, however irrationally, to see as many zombie films as possible, leading me to see over 60 full length films over the last six months or so and a large but uncounted amount of zombie short films on You Tube. As a result of this I have had to up the rank of Zombie Apocalypse to the higher end of the lower third. This does not mean it's good by any means, but it is a sincerely made attempt and I give extra points for sincerity and spirit. Although this seems to have been a bunch of Michigan college students out on Spring Break with time on their hands and a ""let's make a movie"" inspiration, they actually did fairly well with what they had.

A big part of the low ranking of many zombie films is because they have inspired people with hardly any budget. Consider that the average TV episode of The Walking Dead is over a million dollars and a low budget TV sitcom about half that; a minor Hollywood film with minor actors costs three to five million. Zombie Apocalypse had a budget of five thousand dollars, so imagine the difference. This is true of most low budget zombie films. People conditioned to expect certain things in terms of lighting, makeup, cinematography, sound, editing, writing and acting suddenly experience culture shock when they come across these films and discover that things they took for granted as baselines are actually pretty high up in production values. These low budget zombie films immediately turn many people off (understandably), but some of them have real entertainment value (beyond laughing at them which is also often a valid response) if you lower your standards and expectations.

The zombie craze has occurred at a time simultaneous with developments in video cameras that have made it possible for total amateurs to make movies that at least look good. I've seen zombie short films on You Tube made by groups of teenagers or even kids that may have all the problems in script and acting that you would expect, but man, those HD cameras make everything look great. This was made in 2010, just before HD went viral, but it does basically look OK.

They did make the one big mistake that amateurs tend to make, which is being overly ambitious. They might have made a decent short with what they had but instead they decided to make a full length feature film with a large cast in numerous locations. Usually with a tiny budget you keep the cast very small and in a confined space (think Night of the Living Dead or any newer film with that formula), thus cutting out lots of expense. They also complicated the plot with a subplot about the deadly rivalry of two secret government agents, both of whom are played by actors far too young to take seriously in their roles no matter how hard they try to sound like Snake Plissken. The same goes for the local band of militia and the government tribunal who all seem to be nineteen. Don't ask how Agent Net tracks Agent Miller, it's completely unexplained. And the zombies, well, there is an actual scene early on that matches the DVD cover (though without the urban scene behind it ), but for the most part it's just a bunch of young people running around with a bit of makeup on their faces, a little red here and there, and they all are very limber and run really fast. but this is the case of all low budget zombie flicks: the zombies are hard to tell from the regular people but for some red on their faces.

in all fairness, the two college roommates Tom and Mark are well acted by Michael Harthen and David Calkins, with the rest tending to overact and over emote, the problem with most low budget films of any genre. As for the rest, if you want some light entertainment and don't expect much, it's okay. The cover makes it look much scarier than it is. But i do like the group for trying to make a real zombie film, for having over 100 extras as zombies (all named in the final credits, probably their only salary), and for at least staying fairly coherent. There's a sequel hinted at the end but we'll probably never see it. This film is not related to a film called ""Zombie Apocalypse: Redemption"" which is a low budget action film with a few zombies thrown in (probably to get financing).

It's actually kind of good from the dorm scene through the bar scene and seems to show promise that is unfulfilled. But bad as it is, if you're on the down elevator to the worst zombie movie ever made you still have many floors to go.",1459555200,,4538,4.502427184466019
