8142697,1,B000I0QLGE,"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! This is the really bad dub of One Piece that was created by a company that openly believes kids are stupid and illiterate. If you truly are a fan of One Piece please buy the voyage sets that are done by FUNimation. I would only recommend this to you if you're either giving it to someone you hate and want them to know how much you hate them, or if your suicidal and need that one extra push that will make you do it after Dragonball Evolution wasn't able to. Seriously buy the FUNimation DVDs for a true One Piece experience.",1517875200,,556,4.254716981132075
8142698,5,B000I0QLGE,"I know many will disagree because it's the 4Kids version of a great Anime.  However, I personally enjoy this for the sake of it being so bad, it's comedic.",1433721600,,155,4.344827586206897
8142699,3,B000I0QLGE,"It's horrible but in a way that makes it good? We've seen the good dub of this show(funimation) and thought why not get the one that everyone hates and watch that too.
 Was it worth my money and time spent watching it? Yes.
Would I seriously recommend this 4kidz dub to someone? Never!",1432252800,,285,4.377358490566038
8142700,5,B000I0QLGE,"This version of the anime is a guilty pleasure for me; I watched these episodes as a kid but I never really knew if they were even available on DVD. Yeah I know everyone hates this version and I'd be lying if I said I didn't see the huge cringe-worthy plot holes and inconsistencies, but you know what this is TV history that should never be forgotten so that another mistake like this will never happen again.",1416700800,,410,4.337662337662338
8142701,3,B000I0QLGE,"Me and two of my friends enjoy One Piece thoroughly, and we bought this to laugh at how 4Kids killed it. It was hilariously painful. We only got three episodes in though before we had to stop. Good for anyone with masochistic desires or bad taste.",1401062400,,247,4.391304347826087
