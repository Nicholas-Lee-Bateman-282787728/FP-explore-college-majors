8677593,4,B00NERTUMU,"Benjamin (Vincent Lacoste) has just started at the Paris hospital where his papa works and he is convinced he is going to be a model doctor. However; he soon finds out that theory is often easier than practice. He also encounters an Algerian doctor Abdel (Reda Kateb - `A Prophet') who is among the legions of foreign doctors who have to doubly prove themselves in the French medical system.

They get up to the usual shenanigans and also like to party - but the realities of cutbacks and a hospital administrator poached from Amazon (!) starts to make doing their job too difficult.

Now this is supposed to be a comedy - and it was amusing in places but far from being actually laugh out loud. The acting is all fine, and the stories were very good too - I like the fact they all watch `House'.  However this is just a nice film and not one that is going to rock your world - that said I still enjoyed it. If you are a Francophile or like a medical drama then I am sure you will appreciate this Gallic offering.",1438387200,,1013,4.293193717277487
