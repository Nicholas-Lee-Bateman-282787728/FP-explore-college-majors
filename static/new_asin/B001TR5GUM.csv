8342295,5,B001TR5GUM,"This is an excellent introductory DVD documentry on the issues that resulted in the fall of one of the last great empires.  Running slighly less than 3 hrs this DVD set has a lot of ground to cover.  There is some great early film images mixed with a compelling and direct narration.  Some repetition exisit between the three DVDs in the set, but overall the viewer gets a great overview of the Empire and the issues that contributed to its slow decline and fall.  By looking at this fine documentray one can get a very good understanding of the world we live in today as a result of the impact of the British Empire.  Whether one is for or against the legacy of what the British accomplished few can deny the impact today.  A great set worth viewing many times because so much is discussed in a relatively short time.",1265587200,9,818,4.42
