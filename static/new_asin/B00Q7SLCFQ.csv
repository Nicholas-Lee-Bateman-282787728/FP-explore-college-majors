6860322,4,B00Q7SLCFQ,"Bryon Saxton host this annual tradition continues with a DVD set showcasing various matches from the past year of both of WWE's flagship shows (RAW & SmackDown) with a different twist where in addition to Saxton hosting the set that we also get fan's comments on certain events & superstars commentary on their own matches along with various moments including Undertaker & Brock Lesnar's contract signing, Batista addresses the WWE Universe, Daniel Bryan ""occupies"" RAW, The Wyatt Family's children sing-a-long to John Cena, Seth Rollins joins The Authority & explains why, Bree Bella's contract signing with Stephanie McMahon, The Authority presents Brock Lesnar with the new WWE World Heavyweight Championship, and The Rock confronts Rusev & Lana. It should also be noted that just like last year, the Blu-Ray edition is not available due to the low sales of the previous editions.

Matches Include:
John Cena, Sheamus, Daniel Bryan vs. The Shield - This was an Elimination Chamber qualifying match as it was also Sheamus' second match back from his shoulder injury in what was a good match that went back & forth between both teams with each individual having their moment to showcase themselves including one man powering out of a hold that nobody else before him has ever done while The Shield continued to showcase their ability as a team with certain tactics such as double & triple teaming along with keeping their opponent in their half of the ring before it came down to who decided to make their presence known & the domino effect it had on everyone involved in the match.
""RAW"" Jan. 27

Daniel Bryan vs. Randy Orton - This was the first match in a series where Randy Orton had to face each of his Elimination Chamber opponents in individual matches.  Bryan kept catching Orton off guard early causing him to keep retreating to the ropes or the outside as he targeted Orton's leg using whatever he could from the ringpost & the ropes to leg stretches & submissions such as repeated dragonscrew legwhips to the point where Orton had to resort to desperate measures just to get some distance before he was able to slow down the pace working over Bryan's shoulder dropping him directly on it & taking advantage of the ringside environment on the outside more than once as they traded momentum hitting each other with impactful moves & countering each other's signature offense.  Anyone who's followed their feud for the close to a year knows they have great chemistry & never had a bad match (only bad finishes) with this being no exception.
""RAW"" Feb. 3

Rey Mysterio vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Mark Henry vs. Jack Swagger - This was a #1 contenders match for the Intercontinental Championship match at the upcoming Elimination Chamber PPV with champion Big E. on commentary.  This match had it's various highlights & interactions which all four men such as a team being formed to take out the biggest competitor in the match before reverting back to it being ""every man for himself"", and one man performing a high over the top flip dive to the outside only to get caught right away with another high flying move from the apron, and one man german suplexing two of his opponents at the same time.  This was a fun four way with each man showcasing his different wrestling style from Kofi's high flying, Rey's lucha libre, Mark Henry's power, and Jack Swagger's diverse wrestling skills including being able to apply the anklelock from different positions throughout the match.
""SmackDown"" Feb. 14
(Alternate Commentary with Zeb Colter)

John Cena vs. Cesaro - Both men were participants in the Elimination Chamber match at the upcoming PPV while Cesaro had Jack Swagger & Zeb Colter in his corner as Cesaro was able to stay one step ahead of Cena in the first few minutes either keeping Cena off his feet with a headlock takeover & sleeper or catching him while heavily working over the arm in & outside of the ring as Cena was able to deliver some power moves of his arm without the use of his arm as both men traded momentum either countering or just simply powering out of each other's signature offense moves in what was definitely a strong showing from Cesaro who forced Cena to step his game up as well.
""RAW"" Feb. 17

Batista vs. Dolph Ziggler - This was Batista's first match on SmackDown in four years as Dolph kept catching him off guard early on causing Batista to keep retreating to the outside only for Dolph to take advantage of him out there too before Batista was able to focus on a body part throughout the match to not only slow Dolph down but allow him to deliver the same power offense repeatedly as this was all about Batista taking out his frustration & punishing the WWE Universe through Dolph.
""SmackDown"" Feb. 28

WWE Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. The Usos - The Outlaws singled out one Uso early on keeping him grounded & in their half of the ring before he was able to get the hot tag to his partner picking up the pace with both Usos resorting to their trademark offense such as samoan drops along with their high flying in & outside of the ring as this was a short match that was about The Usos finally capturing the Tag Team Championship they've been chasing for close to four years.
""RAW"" Mar. 14

John Cena vs. Luke Harper - The Wyatt Family was at ringside which was a clear distraction to Cena as he kept looking at Bray every few moments as Luke showing his power in a dominate faction as his moves such as a backbreaker & DDT kept taking Cena down while his strong strikes & unique counters such as raking Cena's eyes while in the STF were able to stop Cena's momentum dead in it's tracks whenever he attempted to build it causing Cena to resort to moves that we don't see often from him such as a frankensteiner & a clothesline with such force that he hurt himself but this was all about the final image that had everyone see Cena in a position & his face look in a way we've never seen before.
""RAW"" Mar. 24

WWE Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Paige -  A.J. came out to brag about her dominance over the divas division & being the longest Divas (not Womens) Champion in history before NXT Divas Champion made her debut to congratulate her leading to a challenge from A.J. that ended with Paige doing something that nobody had been able to do for months as this was all about Paige making the biggest impact possible in her debut.
""RAW"" Apr. 7

The Shield vs. Rusev, Alberto Del Rio, Bad News Barrett, Jack Swagger, Fandango, Titus O'Neil, 3MB, RybAxel - The Authority setup this match which was all about giving The Shield a taste of their own medicine by having the numbers game against them with the biggest story being how one of the most dominate factions in WWE history officially reunited to take out the dominate group of today which was The Shield.
""RAW"" Apr. 14

United States Championship/20-Man Battle Royal - Dean Ambrose at this point was the longest reigning United States Champion in WWE history however also had the least amount of title defenses as champion leading to The Authority making his battle royal that had some highlights such as one man being the most dominate eliminations in the match & also having a confrontation that was a ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" confrontation leading to both men being singled out by every other participant along with some ""accidental"" eliminations in what was your typical battle royal.
""RAW"" May 5

John Cena & The Usos vs. The Wyatt Family - Cena came into this match very hot throwing punches both both Luke Harper & Erick Rowan while the Uso's continued the momentum at a fast pace before The Wyatt's were able to stop things dead in their tracks keeping their opponents grounded & slowing down the pace as both teams traded momentum using the same strategy against each other working towards their corners & using double team tactics as this came down to one team just being able to catch the other.
""SmackDown"" May 9

Bo Dallas vs. Sin Cara - This was the debut of ""BOlieve"" Bo Dallas as he showcased his personality after almost every offensive move allowing Sin Cara to catch him off guard from different springboard positions before Dallas got more aggressive as this was all about showcasing Dallas & his ""BOlieve"" attitude before, during, and after the match.
""SmackDown"" May 23
(Alternate Commentary with Bo Dallas)

Goldust & Stardust vs. RybAxel - After Cody Rhodes felt like he was the weak link of his team & Goldust had nothing but failures with his other partners, this was the debut of his new partner in Stardust as the match went less than a minute but made a lasting impression.
""RAW"" June 16
(Alternate Commentary with Stardust)

Mud Pool Match: Vickie Guerrero vs. Stephanie McMahon - The Authority put Vickie's career on the line in this match with them stacking the odds against her that she couldn't overcome as this was pretty much about Vickie ending her WWE career for close to 7 year ""losing the battle but winning the war"" on the way out along with paying tribute to her late husband Eddie Guerrero.
""RAW"" June 23

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins - Both former Shield members started trading blows against each other in the ring right away & continued throughout the crowd onto the stage area before making their way back into the ring where both men found creative ways to use a chair against each other along with other weapons such as a kendo stick as they were able to counter each other's signature moves while continuing to just beat the hell out of each other including sacrificing themselves just to hurt their opponent to the point where the only way this match stopped was that one man had to take it too far to ensure the other guy wouldn't get back up.
""RAW"" Aug. 18
[Destruction Of The Shield]

Steel Cage Match: Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men were trading blows & stopping each other's attempts at escaping early on before one man was able to start using the cage to his advantage using his opponents momentum against him to send him into & sandwitching him against the cage only for his opponent to use the same tactics as well using the cage as a weapon as both men traded momentum such as countering each other's trademark offense along with taking some big high risk attempts from the top rope & even off the top of the cage as it literally came down to the wire between both men in such an evenly matched contest from start to finish.
""RAW"" Sept. 8

Team Teddy (Mark Henry, Sheamus, The Usos, Jack Swagger, Los Matadores, El Torito) vs. Team Johnny (Bo Dallas, Damien Sandow, Goldust, Stardust, Heath Slater, Titus O'Neil, Cesaro, Hornswoggle) - This was from the 15th anniversary of SmackDown & a rematch from WrestleMania XVIII with both Teddy Long & Johnny Ace representing a team to see who was the greatest General Manager in SmackDown history as this was just a fun match all around with a mix of wrestling & athleticism & pure entertainment with everyone having their moment to showcase themselves...including Hornswoggle as ""The Gator.""
""SmackDown"" Oct. 10

Randy Orton vs. Seth Rollins - Tensions & physical encounters between these two members of The Authority causing this match to be set up for them to get it out of their system so they could be on the same page headed into Survivor Series with the other members of The Authority at ringside to witness this as both men started off trading punches with Orton getting the upper hand tossing Seth around on the outside using whatever was around him against Seth & staying one step ahead of him being able to avoid some of his offense along before Seth was able to move things in his favor being able to counter Orton's signature offense & deliver some of his own including one move directly in front of Triple H at ringside as this came down to just one man being able to catch the other off guard long enough to get the win but the bigger story is what happened when one man just couldn't control his temper causing Triple H to give the order to ""finish this!"" leaving one man in a condition that we rarely see in this ""TV-PG"" era of WWE.
""RAW"" Nov. 3

Elimination Match: Intercontinental Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. Cesaro vs. Tyson Kidd - This started out as every man for himself with all three men going for different pin attempts against each other in the opening moments followed by different highlights & interaction between all three men such as Cesaro showing his strength countering an attempted double suplex, one man one the recieving end of a powerbomb then getting a springboard elbow drop right after only for the person who deliver that to get a suplex from his other opponent, one man delievering a running dropkick only to get caught right afterwords & tossed across the ring with a belly to belly suplex, two opponents on the receiving end of a neckbreaker & DDT combination at the same time, a powerbomb out of the corner that also resulted in a superplex, a pin attempt on an opponent while the man attempting the pin was caught in a submission move, and the athletic showcase between the last two men in a match that was worth the ""this is awesome"" chants it got.
""SmackDown"" Nov. 14

John Cena, Ryback, Dolph Ziggler vs. Seth Rollins, Kane, Luke Harper - All of these men had matches at the upcoming PPV against an opponent on the other team in a six man tag that saw both teams trade momentum throughout the contest using the same strategy of using double team tactics including one that caused J.B.L. to reference the Roll N' Roll Express with one team keeping a fast pace while the other tried to slow it down & keep their opponents grounded but this was just a preview match for the upcoming tables & ladders & chairs (& stairs) matches at the upcoming PPV.
""RAW"" Dec. 1

This is the case every single year as there wasn't much room for every single standout or relevant match on each show to be put on here but there's always certain matches that could have easily been replaced in favor of those that didn't make the cut as they didn't have any real relevance to be put on a ""Best Of"" set as although they did have some of the best quality TV matches on here, there were many matches & moments that really didn't have much importance compared to what was left off. In the end, I would still check it out if you were a fan of the TV product.",1421020800,5,14318,4.600705329153605

8690779,1,B00Q7SLCFQ,I got this for my son for Easter from the Easter Bunny and all 3 discs where from a Ric Flair collection not Raw. My son is so disappointed!!,1523059200,,141,3.896551724137931
8690780,3,B00Q7SLCFQ,"Little disappointed for two reasons: first, I only got The Best Of Raw And SmackDown 2014. I never got 2013. And second, Alot of the things that were shown on here weren't what I would have picked if I was doing the compilation. Plus some things that SHOULD HAVE been on here wasn't! Not sure who made the decisions of what goes on and what doesn't, but they really screwed up in my opinion.",1512864000,,391,4.297297297297297

8690785,4,B00Q7SLCFQ,"2014 was a bittersweet year for WWE as well as its fans. For the good and memorable side; we witnessed Daniel Bryan's battle against Triple H on the Road To Wrestlemania that lead to him winning the World Title in the main event of Wrestlemania 30, The Shield vs The Wyatt Family feud, several great NXT Takeover PPVs, Paige's debut, the reformation of Evolution, Seth Rollins' shocking heel turn against The Shield that lead to him winning the Money In The Bank briefcase, the return of masked Kane, Cesaro winning the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, Sting's debut, Brock Lesnar's terrorizing german suplex fest at SummerSlam, AJ Lee vs Paige, and much more.

But WWE also had its bad moments in 2014 as well such as the shocking and sudden death of the Ultimate Warrior, Batista's Royal Rumble win that caused hostility among the fans, CM Punk's sudden departure, the shocking end to Undertaker's Wrestlemania undefeated streak conquered by Brock Lesnar, Daniel Bryan's neck surgery that halted his push right as it was taking off, the horrible Brie Bella vs Nikki Bella feud, the burial of the Wyatt Family, Dean Ambrose losing a match to an exploding television, Bluetista, and much more.

While most of the mentioned moments above aren't featured in this DVD set, there are still some fairly remarkable moments WWE put in this set. Disc 1 takes us from January through March. Notable matches and segments featured on the first disc include, John Cena vs Cesaro, a #1 Contender Fatal 4 Way match for the Intercontinental Championship, Brock Lesnar and Undertaker's Wrestlemania contract signing, and Batista's heel turn. Disc 2 continues in March and goes through June containing moments such as Daniel Bryan occupying Raw, Paige's debut and defeating AJ for the Diva's Championship, Evolution's reformation, The Wyatt Family's children choir haunting John Cena, and Seth Rollins turning on The Shield.

The final disc continues in June and ends in December containing moments and matches such as Vickie Guerrero's last match, Brie Bella and Stephanie McMahon's SummerSlam contract signing, Chris Jericho and Bray Wyatt's Steel Cage match, The Rock's surprising return to insult Rusev and Lana, and Team Teddy vs Team Johnny from Smackdown's 15th Anniversary.

Overall: The Best of Raw and Smackdown 2014 turned out to be a fairly good set. I stopped buying them after 2012's Best of because they were slacking with good content to include. I don't plan on buying this DVD set, simply because I have the WWE Network to go back and relive each moment that's on this DVD but that doesn't mean it's not a good set. In fact, it's probably the best Best of Raw/Smackdown DVD since the 2011's Best of. Most of the top feuds of 2014 got recognition with either matches or segments. I was disappointed when I first saw the listing that no mention of The Shield vs The Wyatt Family or Ultimate Warrior's final speech made it on to the disc, but as I said, it really doesn't matter because the WWE Network has everything that happened in 2014 at one click of a mouse...unless you don't have it. Overall, the Best of Raw and Smackdown 2014 was a nicely put together compilation DVD of some of Raw and Smackdown's best moments and matches that took place over the course of 2014.",1426982400,2,3278,4.869175627240144
8690786,3,B00Q7SLCFQ,The year of 2014 was a very action packed and eventful year. I feel as if this DVD set didn't cover the most important events. One that sticks out in my mind was the undertakers streak coming to an end. They barley touched on it. Another point I haven't been a fan of. Over the last two years they haven't had it divided month by month like years previous. You have no idea what time it is in the year unless you use context clues such as the ppv of that month. Other then that I guess it was a good DVD set,1425427200,4,507,3.9320388349514563
