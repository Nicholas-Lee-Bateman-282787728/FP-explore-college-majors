8093544,4,B000BWFSNG,"Documentary of enjoyable artists of Wisconsin. Movie low on production value but very worth watching if you enjoy documentaries and artists. Interviewer Scoop Perlman is quirky and mellow. The artists are low on pretensions, high on invention. All people can be artists; and Everybody Should. (what is the snobby, exclusiveness in some artists and collectors ABOUT anyway??) This movie features art that is accessible and available to all. Baraboo's Dr. Evermore's industrial salvage constructions of giant insects, mechanical birds, and ""The Forevertron"". Shy, softspoken Nadine Mercil and her disturbing dolls and dollhouses --the opposite person of what I expected. The upsetting words worked into her pieces (which she says are not true) are compulsively present, like an artistic tourettes syndrome. Rob Em and Taggerboy, two likeable young graffiti artists in Madison. And lastly Phil Porter. (Phil was institutionalized at Southern Wisconsin Colony in Racine between the formative ages of 8 to 21 because of cognitive disabilities, seizures and hyperactivity.) Phil states -""I originally felt I was an outcast to society. Some thought I was good for nothing, like I was trash. Now I feel like I'm part of society and make contributions like others. I work and sell my art in the community. I feel my art is part of me and lets people know more about me...."" That says it all doesn't it? What art can be and what art can do: Communicate between people; make a community.",1165622400,2,1476,5.179916317991632
