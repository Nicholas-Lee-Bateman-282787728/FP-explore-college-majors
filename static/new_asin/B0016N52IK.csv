3161769,5,B0016N52IK,"This production, while at first seemingly rag-tag, is a rather in depth look at the varied inconsistencies one finds amongst the September 11th attacks and the resulting report on its origins.  They tackle everything from the late start of the actual investigation to the omission of key events such as the beautiful and clean collapse of Building 7; they even go so far as to dig up flight history reports and voice pattern analyses of the alleged callers from the doomed flights.  To be perfectly honest, after having seen this production, I realize just how theatrical the entire incident was; frankly, who now, after all this Romanesque society has been through, what with the decadent though sadistic Bush Administration at the helm, could see a film of this nature and NOT think that our leader(s) are markedly capable of such base, rotton, and dastardly acts of terror?  I most certainly believe them capable of that and more... and any citizen of the United States who wishes for our country to survive into the next half century would do well to mark Mr Jones', Mr. McGovern's, and Mr Feal's words.",1213488000,70,1107,4.8465608465608465
3161770,4,B0016N52IK,"The original Loose Change documentary famously went on to become the most downloaded video in Internet history, and with good reason. More than for any other international disaster, the events of 9/11 have not been adequately explained by the government in the eyes of many citizens. At first, those who questioned the official explanation were lambasted as kooks and conspiracy nuts, but as time passed and more and more unanswered questions emerged, people the world over - including academics, scientists and experts in many fields - began to feel extremely uneasy about 9/11 and the subsequent political and military agenda which it was used to justify. Loose Change Final Cut is a completely new film by the people who made the original and whatever your views on 9/11 are, this powerful documentary provides a very great deal of food for thought. Conspiracy or not, one thing seems clear - the official explanation for the events of 9/11 is not all it seems.",1213315200,48,964,4.95679012345679

3161787,2,B0016N52IK,"In short,the earlier edition ""Loose Change 9/11"" is superior. The first one was excellent!

Owning both the earlier ""Loose Change 9/11"" and this so-called ""Final"" edition; they couldn't be more different. Gone is Daniel Sunjata's excellent and well crafted narration, the cohesive organization, tastefully spare music and effective use of graphics.

The ""Final Cut"" edition loses all of these, and then some, and the result seems weakly narrated and disjointed. Where is the very important segment with the nano-thermite analysis? Gone. The ""Final Cut"" edition has a few more interviews and apparently a few too many cooks in the kitchen. If anything, this edition harms the cause by limiting the message.

The first edition focused on building a powerful case, which leaves the audience asking tough questions.  However, this edition works REALLY hard to appear 'hip' and edgy with redundant shots of bedraggled-looking demonstrators, unnecessary graphic moves, and... was that a shot of the ridiculous Michael Moore? Seriously?! And who lobbied for the distracting, irrelevant 'hip-hop' soundtrack? Did Mr Avery owe some friends some favors?

They tried to explain that conspiracies of this caliber cannot exist because there would be whistle blowers.  Apparently they never heard of the CIA.

3161789,3,B0016N52IK,"As a piece of entertainment done on a shoe string budget this is a great film. It is done with enthusiam, talent and shrewd production. However like many of these sorts of 911 films it only presents certain parameters of evidence and motives that when viewed together with the bigger picture simply do not add up.

The first major absence of evidence lies with the collapsing towers. Real footage is presented with theories that all entice the viewer into thinking this is what happened very nicely but empirical evidence is missing. There is no mention of the affect aircraft aluminium has when super heated in such a collision (it creates thermitic behaviour) and no mention of the exact time it took for each tower to fall (no it wasn't free fall speed but slower). The second absence of evidence lies with blaming the US gov or shadow government for the attacks with little information presented on the arab world in general, the real suicide bomber threat that exists and the lack of real benefits the US government could have got out of such an attack.

So the idea that this film went from a fictional tale into a documentary I think is false. What it went from is a small fictional tale into a successful widely publicised fictional tale.

These 911 conspiracy films are all great fun and are interesting in the way they present information and make you ask questions. But do they ask the right questions and do they present the real truth? Unfortunately they dont. They provide answers for a gullable public that can't accept a world that could produce lone Oswalds and radical islamic suicide bombers but not answers for people who accept hard unrefutable evidence.

3161794,1,B0016N52IK,"I know that right off the bat, I'm going to get attacked.

I am not new to conspiracies. I've studied the JFK assassination, but looking at all the evidence over the years leads me to believe Oswald was a lone shooter. He still could have been put up to it, however. There is no doubt in my mind that the MLK Jr. slaying was a hit job. I believe the 2000 election was stolen by Katherine Harris, Jeb Bush, the Supreme Court, hired Republicans that disrupted recounts, and more.

However, to claim 9/11 was an inside job gives the government a lot more credit then it deserves. I will address any counter-arguments that appear in reply to this, as long as they are civil. Keep in mind, I spent a long time researching this, sorting fact from fiction, viewing countless hours of footage from multiple angles.

I will address some main points.

1. Explosions heard in the building.

The very first 911 page, at the exact time of the first plane impact, is for security to check a possible explosion and enter an emergency code of action. Of course, those in the lobby had no way of knowing right away that it had been a plane, since the 1993 bombing was fresh in most people's minds that worked there.

Later reports tended to occur near elevator shafts, where the force of decompressing air from the collapsing structure blew the doors off several shafts, or near electrical generators, fuse boxes, pipes bursting, or other things that are known to ""explode"" under high stress. Cops and firefighters were breaking windows. People were even quoted as describing the sounds of jumpers landing to their deaths as ""sounding like a bomb going off"". To take that kind of quote out of context is not just wrong, it's downright sick.

See [...] for the FULL quotes regarding explosions, which you won't find in Loose Change.

2. Building 7.

Building 7 was VERY badly damaged from the collapse of the towers. Not only that, it had multiple emergency fuel generators located at various points in it since it was serving as the emergency management center. This fuel, combined with the existing damage, was enough to knock out the center support beam. The rest went shortly afterwords. You can see a detailed diagram and footage of the collapse, and of damage to the building, at [...] , which even shows just how badly other nearby buildings were affected.

3161795,1,B0016N52IK,"Take some young independent film makers who apparently have no science background and zero understanding of physics and engineering.

Add an American public that has grown up in an era of Hollywood film fantasy.

3161799,5,B0016N52IK,"Loose Change: Final Cut

It has been interesting to watch the development of Dylan Avery from a home filmmaker with attitude into a Director of worth and talent.

'Loose Change: Final Cut' is the most mature and arresting of his series of Documentary films on 9/11.  It should be taken very seriously. Gone are the youthful assertions of his earlier work. The rapidly maturing Director now simply asks questions, shows or explains evidence and is careful to not to speculate.

The wealth of information Dylan Avery's team have collected is extraordinary. The evidence shows beyond a doubt that the official ""conspiracy theory"" put forth by the American Government is suspect.

What I find practically insidious is the blatant obstruction of justice perpetrated by the Bush administration after the attacks and their stone-walling of any coherent and independent investigation.

Dylan Avery should be praised for making all of his 'Loose Change"" films even if you disagree with the content because these films have encouraged many people to question the events of that day and seek some truth. Loose Change: Final Cut should be regarded as the best of the series.",1252627200,4,1162,5.121693121693122
3161800,5,B0016N52IK,"LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT is a strikingly well made documentary DVD about 9/11 from late 2007.  It's ostensibly a sequel to two earlier films by Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas - LOOSE CHANGE and LOOSE CHANGE SECOND EDITION - but in reality it serves as a worthwhile, standalone production deserving of being viewed entirely without reference to those earlier works.  The two initial LOOSE CHANGE movies were somewhat low budget affairs (the first one extremely so) which nonetheless gained widespread attention on the internet and in the mainstream media.  After those, Avery and Bermas set out to recount the same story - starting over from scratch - with a much higher production budget, large amounts of newly located archival footage, and completely updated research and interviews.  The film was worth the wait, and in the months following its release numerous friends of mine after viewing it have attested to its high quality. (Though it has since been largely confined to DVD, the film also received a theatrical release in the UK following its completion).  As stated, this FINAL CUT contains nothing from those earlier two editions. Folks who have only seen the previous films (and there should be many, as the earlier SECOND EDITION was at one point the most widely viewed internet movie of all time) are offered a strong encouragement to see this new production.  Viewers who have not yet seen any of the three are advised to start directly with this, the best of the series by a significant margin.

LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT methodically takes us back through a guided tour of the official 9/11 story, and simultaneously shows us footage and testimony that allows us to view that familiar narrative in a markedly different light.  Elements of the official story are shown to be ridiculous, at complete odds with what is shown by archival footage, or strangely out of place when viewed in light of the rest of the government's version of events.  A voiceover narration by director Dylan Avery (who has matured here from past editions into a truly effective speaker) reinforces key points, and asks us to think carefully about others.  Large amounts of startling and unsettling information are conveyed, much of it almost hypnotically at variance from the official narrative of 9/11 that we all remember.  The effect is gripping.  The film is elegiac, frequently arresting, disquieting at times, frightening in its implications, and energizing in how it depicts a way forward for the viewers who comprehend the import of its message.

The film covers a large amount of territory, and probably requires more than a single viewing to comfortably retain all the information that it has to offer.  The increased budget is evident in the soundtrack, the editing and the overall strong technical polish.  (From time to time, when the film wants to visualize a point or depict a detailed recreation of events, high quality CG graphics show us these moments in 3D.  These CG effects were provided by a Euro production house and are definitely attention grabbing).  Various chapters of the film cover news reports, the coincidental, highly contentious `military drills' that mirrored the real events of the day, the jet crash in Shanksville, the collapse of the twin towers and WTC7, the troubled formation and history of the eventual investigative commission, and more.  A listing of all the worthwhile aspects of the film's coverage of these topics would make for a longer review, but certain scenes should be noted.

Early on, we see 2007-era footage from CNN of an E-4B aircraft - a giant white jumbo used by the government as a hyper sophisticated communications device - circling over Washington during the time of the initial 9/11 attack.  The CNN news report, emphasizing the oddness of the event, dubs the aircraft a `9/11mystery plane'.  When CNN directly questions the military about the subject, the military refuses to acknowledge the planes existence.  The events comprising the `official story' of 9/11 were widely promoted by the Bush administration, and endlessly repeated by the media to the extent that they are now known worldwide because of that continuous publicity.  In contrast, the presence on that day of the E-4B shown in LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT was absent from the 9/11 Commission report, has been denied by the military, and remained unknown to most until CNN (spurred by initial stories on the internet) gingerly touched upon the topic.  The repeated CNN footage of this giant military aircraft purposefully loop-the-looping in circles over Washington, at a time when the military command was elsewhere being taken unaware by the unfolding terrorist attack and reportedly learning of events, is dramatic.  (A 2008 book by Mark Gaffney, THE 9/11 MYSTERY PLANE AND THE VANISHING OF AMERICA, examines this story in further detail.)  In LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT, we see the activities of the E-4B in light of the complicated war-game maneuvers the Pentagon was conducting, simulating `unthinkable' terrorist attacks featuring terrorists flying airplanes into buildings.

The film examines the events that occurred at the Pentagon.  Norman Mineta, Transportation Secretary at the time, is shown giving testimony to Lee Hamilton at a hearing regarding Dick Cheney's unusual behavior on the morning of the attack.  An activist later chats to Mineta in public, on camera, and recounts back to him the Commission Report's written summary of what it suggests he actually said.  Mineta looks visibly surprised.  (The disquieting implications of Mineta's testimony regarding the former Vice President, and other accounts and reports that all support Mineta's version of events, are discussed at greater length in Chapters 12 and 13 of Peter Dale Scott's THE ROAD TO 9/11).  We see footage of casualties from the Pentagon being evacuated on stretchers.  Ray McGovern, a veteran CIA analyst, is eventually shown offering a frank assessment of Cheney that in a perfect world would be the highlight of upcoming 10th anniversary TV specials discussing the attacks in 2011, but which I suspect will be absent from those programs.

The film discusses the collapse of the towers in pointed detail.  We see a rapid montage of live-to-air witnesses from TV discussing the collapse of the buildings on the day of the attacks, the footage of which runs for nearly 5 minutes.  Witness after witness exclaims ""We heard explosions"", ""There was an explosion"", ""We just saw a big explosion"", and so on, and so on.  A reporter asks a policeman to clarify if he really witnessed an explosion, or just debris falling from the building.  The policeman repeats that it was an explosion, with a look on his face that now makes me wonder if he had realized then what so many people are still having trouble acknowledging now.

Indian Lake Borough mayor Barry Lichty discusses the events at Shanksville, and shakes his head with bemusement as he pages through the 9/11 Commission Report, reading (like Mineta) a version of events that does not match what he saw and heard that day. We also witness footage from 9/11 of rescue crew teams investigating the official Shanksville crash site.  One of the searchers on camera walks back and forth over the debris field, visibly perplexed at the lack of debris.  Attentive viewers may be just as bothered themselves.

Later in the film, a segment shows us the members of the 9/11 Commission, and highlights their relationships to various companies and organizations that benefited from the attacks and the subsequent war on terror.  The section concludes with a surreal shot of `Executive Director' Philip Zelikow, who, as now recorded by author Philip Shenon, told the commission exactly what he wanted the final report to say before they'd begun gathering any evidence.

An activist, furious at the stonewalling, back-patting and circuitous non-investigation conducted by the commission members, exits a hearing and angrily shouts comments as he departs.  The man's most pointed remark is used to conclude the end credits of this movie.  In the background of the soundtrack at that moment, you can hear the gathered crowd clapping.  When I first heard this, I thought the crowd was applauding the man for making the statement that he had just made.  Now, however, I realize that the crowd is applauding the fact that he is being removed from the room.  Under the range of circumstances covered by this movie, I think anyone who considers the substance of the man's statement will find the crowd's knee-jerk enthusiasm for his removal, on reflection, sad in a way that is hard to describe.

The film ends on a disquieting note, making points that I feel remain valid even though the key political suspects (an appropriate term) accused by the film no longer occupy the White House.  The end credits of the movie features poignant film clips - news footage, protesters, and footage newly shot by the filmmakers - over a hypnotic music track, with the lyrics commenting on the imagery.  One quick shot from this credit sequence features Barry Jennings, a witness to the WTC7 collapse who later had some additional, pointed things to say about what he saw that day (not featured in this movie, but highlighted in FABLED ENEMIES, a follow-up DVD from the same filmmakers).  FABLED ENEMIES is a good film, LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT a great one, but FABLED ENEMIES is still worth watching, especially as Jennings now lacks the ability to comment much further on these matters, even if he wanted to.

The DVD of this film is formatted in 16x9 format, and looks and sounds perfectly fine on my widescreen TV.  If I had to pick one movie to show someone receptive to thinking about - or, more accurately, rethinking - the events of 9/11, this would be it.  LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT is a formidable documentary accomplishment, and a friend of mine has noted that it really deserves to be broadcast in primetime on national TV.  The film maintains a strong emotional impact on me, even after multiple viewings.  I suggest that people watch it, then continue with several other films and additional books, so they can gain a deeper understanding of how all the various, complex pieces of information fit together.  After starting with LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT, I recommend watching 9/11 AND AMERICAN EMPIRE: INTELLECTUALS SPEAK OUT, then TERRORSTORM: SECOND EDITION.  (Both of these are also available on DVD from Amazon).  I'd suggest that viewers consider the footage in TERRORSTORM of newsreaders discussing the `mock terrorist drills' in London which occurred on the day of the 7/7 bombings.  Those scenes should be compared to the footage already noted from LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT where 9/11 Commission members shrug and disregard questions from the public regarding the similar, coincidental `mock terrorist drills' carried out by the US military on the day of the 9/11 attacks.  (`Vigilant Warrior' and `Vigilant Guardian' are two such drills.  LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT shows footage of Cynthia McKinney asking Joint Chiefs of Staff head Richard Myers to discuss them, and an audience member leaving a hearing in frustration when the commission members refuse to even acknowledge the issue.  Webster Tarpley offers a thoughtful analysis of those drills in the two-part DVD lecture `Facing the Truth about 9/11').  For books, I strongly recommend David Ray Griffin's DEBUNKING 9/11 DEBUNKING and THE NEW PEARL HARBOUR REVISTED.  Ian Henshall's more recent 9/11: THE NEW EVIDENCE is outstanding and offers a respected British journalist's viewpoint on the same issue.  Finally, Webster Tarpley's 9/11 SYNTHETIC TERROR is, along with Henshall's book, probably the best work yet written on the subject, and the numerous five star reviews it maintains here on Amazon are some indication of this.  In the meantime, do not miss LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT.",1238544000,27,11859,5.07157569515963

3161806,1,B0016N52IK,"This film is the end-result emesis of two conspiracy theory-obsessed frat boys who decided to throw together a paranoid fantasy for a film school class.

What garbage. These guys remind me of the members of the Flat Earth Society, but the Flat Earth people aren't offensive. LOOSE CHANGE presents us with the premise that the September 11th tragedy was somehow orchestrated by the Bush Administration, and that the deaths of 3,000 Americans that day were machinated to obtain some murky political gain.

The only thing that's really murky about LOOSE CHANGE is the gray matter of its creators, two ""9/11 Truthers,"" who ""prove"" with slanted and cherry-picked ""empirical evidence"" that commercial jets did not fly into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, that the collapse of the towers was the result of a controlled detonation, and other such nonsense. This ""search for the truth"" only serves to discredit legitimate critics of Administration policies, and creates distractions that allow questionable governmental activities to go unchecked. How convenient for the leadership. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Bushworld is subsidizing the costs of the constant remakes of this film.

First, the producers of LOOSE CHANGE endow the Bush Administration with a level of intelligence which would render them capable of formulating and then carrying out in absolute secrecy a huge, coordinated, and successful plan to disrupt the very Military-Industrial Complex that they control. This is the same bureaucracy that can't manage to mail out a universal tax stimulus check without losing tens of thousands of them.  The existence of such intelligence among them is a condition for which there is no proof.

Second, the creators of LOOSE CHANGE are not structural engineers, nor aircraft engineers, and their criticism that the mass of wreckage at the crash sites doesn't match the mass of the destroyed planes doesn't hold up in the face of physics. Immense kinetic energy was generated by the crashes, energy which vaporized the planes, the people, and critical portions of the massive structures of the World Trade Center and The Pentagon as though they were struck by a supernova. Simply put, the usual remnant evidence of a random plane crash is a chaos of flaming, twisted wreckage, but few plane crashes match these: Prior to 9/11, fully-laden jets were never intentionally aimed at and rammed into targets at 500 mph or more. The physical consequences of such collisions are something previously never seen. To say what should or shouldn't have occurred requires a level of omniscience these boys will never have.

More subjectively, this film is an insult to the memories of those who died that day, the rest of us who suffered, and to the common sense intelligence of a thinking audience.

No, kids, the planes didn't hit the towers. Amelia Earhart flew them to Paris, everyone aboard moved to the Rive Gauche, and they are all living in sin with Elvis and Jim Morrison at D.B. Cooper's house, atop a grassy knoll.

Spare me. A meaningful investigation about the Intelligence and communications failures of that day would be welcome. Instead, we get ""The Protocols of The Elders of Washington."" If Nine-Eleven taught us anything, it was this: Don't waste moments of your life watching this film; you won't get them back.",1220659200,26,3330,5.097247706422018

The ""Final Cut"" edition has a few more interviews and apparently a few too many cooks in the kitchen. If anything, this edition harms the cause by limiting the message.

The first edition focused on building a powerful case, which leaves the audience asking tough questions.

3396286,3,B0016N52IK,"As a piece of entertainment done on a shoe string budget this is a great film. It is done with enthusiam, talent and shrewd production. However like many of these sorts of 911 films it only presents certain parameters of evidence and motives that when viewed together with the bigger picture simply do not add up.

The first major absence of evidence lies with the collapsing towers. Real footage is presented with theories that all entice the viewer into thinking this is what happened very nicely but empirical evidence is missing. There is no mention of the affect aircraft aluminium has when super heated in such a collision (it creates thermitic behaviour) and no mention of the exact time it took for each tower to fall (no it wasn't free fall speed but slower). The second absence of evidence lies with blaming the US gov or shadow government for the attacks with little information presented on the arab world in general, the real suicide bomber threat that exists and the lack of real benefits the US government could have got out of such an attack.

So the idea that this film went from a fictional tale into a documentary I think is false. What it went from is a small fictional tale into a successful widely publicised fictional tale.

These 911 conspiracy films are all great fun and are interesting in the way they present information and make you ask questions. But do they ask the right questions and do they present the real truth? Unfortunately they dont. They provide answers for a gullable public that can't accept a world that could produce lone Oswalds and radical islamic suicide bombers but not answers for people who accept hard unrefutable evidence.

I am not new to conspiracies. I've studied the JFK assassination, but looking at all the evidence over the years leads me to believe Oswald was a lone shooter. He still could have been put up to it, however. There is no doubt in my mind that the MLK Jr. slaying was a hit job. I believe the 2000 election was stolen by Katherine Harris, Jeb Bush, the Supreme Court, hired Republicans that disrupted recounts, and more.

However, to claim 9/11 was an inside job gives the government a lot more credit then it deserves. I will address any counter-arguments that appear in reply to this, as long as they are civil. Keep in mind, I spent a long time researching this, sorting fact from fiction, viewing countless hours of footage from multiple angles.

I will address some main points.

1. Explosions heard in the building.

The very first 911 page, at the exact time of the first plane impact, is for security to check a possible explosion and enter an emergency code of action. Of course, those in the lobby had no way of knowing right away that it had been a plane, since the 1993 bombing was fresh in most people's minds that worked there.

Later reports tended to occur near elevator shafts, where the force of decompressing air from the collapsing structure blew the doors off several shafts, or near electrical generators, fuse boxes, pipes bursting, or other things that are known to ""explode"" under high stress. Cops and firefighters were breaking windows. People were even quoted as describing the sounds of jumpers landing to their deaths as ""sounding like a bomb going off"". To take that kind of quote out of context is not just wrong, it's downright sick.

See [...] for the FULL quotes regarding explosions, which you won't find in Loose Change.

2. Building 7.

Building 7 was VERY badly damaged from the collapse of the towers. Not only that, it had multiple emergency fuel generators located at various points in it since it was serving as the emergency management center. This fuel, combined with the existing damage, was enough to knock out the center support beam. The rest went shortly afterwords. You can see a detailed diagram and footage of the collapse, and of damage to the building, at [...] , which even shows just how badly other nearby buildings were affected.

3396296,5,B0016N52IK,"Loose Change: Final Cut

It has been interesting to watch the development of Dylan Avery from a home filmmaker with attitude into a Director of worth and talent.

'Loose Change: Final Cut' is the most mature and arresting of his series of Documentary films on 9/11.  It should be taken very seriously. Gone are the youthful assertions of his earlier work. The rapidly maturing Director now simply asks questions, shows or explains evidence and is careful to not to speculate.

The wealth of information Dylan Avery's team have collected is extraordinary. The evidence shows beyond a doubt that the official ""conspiracy theory"" put forth by the American Government is suspect.

What I find practically insidious is the blatant obstruction of justice perpetrated by the Bush administration after the attacks and their stone-walling of any coherent and independent investigation.

Dylan Avery should be praised for making all of his 'Loose Change"" films even if you disagree with the content because these films have encouraged many people to question the events of that day and seek some truth. Loose Change: Final Cut should be regarded as the best of the series.",1252627200,4,1162,5.121693121693122
3396297,5,B0016N52IK,"LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT is a strikingly well made documentary DVD about 9/11 from late 2007.  It's ostensibly a sequel to two earlier films by Dylan Avery and Jason Bermas - LOOSE CHANGE and LOOSE CHANGE SECOND EDITION - but in reality it serves as a worthwhile, standalone production deserving of being viewed entirely without reference to those earlier works.  The two initial LOOSE CHANGE movies were somewhat low budget affairs (the first one extremely so) which nonetheless gained widespread attention on the internet and in the mainstream media.  After those, Avery and Bermas set out to recount the same story - starting over from scratch - with a much higher production budget, large amounts of newly located archival footage, and completely updated research and interviews.  The film was worth the wait, and in the months following its release numerous friends of mine after viewing it have attested to its high quality. (Though it has since been largely confined to DVD, the film also received a theatrical release in the UK following its completion).  As stated, this FINAL CUT contains nothing from those earlier two editions. Folks who have only seen the previous films (and there should be many, as the earlier SECOND EDITION was at one point the most widely viewed internet movie of all time) are offered a strong encouragement to see this new production.  Viewers who have not yet seen any of the three are advised to start directly with this, the best of the series by a significant margin.

LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT methodically takes us back through a guided tour of the official 9/11 story, and simultaneously shows us footage and testimony that allows us to view that familiar narrative in a markedly different light.  Elements of the official story are shown to be ridiculous, at complete odds with what is shown by archival footage, or strangely out of place when viewed in light of the rest of the government's version of events.  A voiceover narration by director Dylan Avery (who has matured here from past editions into a truly effective speaker) reinforces key points, and asks us to think carefully about others.  Large amounts of startling and unsettling information are conveyed, much of it almost hypnotically at variance from the official narrative of 9/11 that we all remember.  The effect is gripping.  The film is elegiac, frequently arresting, disquieting at times, frightening in its implications, and energizing in how it depicts a way forward for the viewers who comprehend the import of its message.

The film covers a large amount of territory, and probably requires more than a single viewing to comfortably retain all the information that it has to offer.  The increased budget is evident in the soundtrack, the editing and the overall strong technical polish.  (From time to time, when the film wants to visualize a point or depict a detailed recreation of events, high quality CG graphics show us these moments in 3D.  These CG effects were provided by a Euro production house and are definitely attention grabbing).  Various chapters of the film cover news reports, the coincidental, highly contentious `military drills' that mirrored the real events of the day, the jet crash in Shanksville, the collapse of the twin towers and WTC7, the troubled formation and history of the eventual investigative commission, and more.  A listing of all the worthwhile aspects of the film's coverage of these topics would make for a longer review, but certain scenes should be noted.

Early on, we see 2007-era footage from CNN of an E-4B aircraft - a giant white jumbo used by the government as a hyper sophisticated communications device - circling over Washington during the time of the initial 9/11 attack.  The CNN news report, emphasizing the oddness of the event, dubs the aircraft a `9/11mystery plane'.  When CNN directly questions the military about the subject, the military refuses to acknowledge the planes existence.  The events comprising the `official story' of 9/11 were widely promoted by the Bush administration, and endlessly repeated by the media to the extent that they are now known worldwide because of that continuous publicity.  In contrast, the presence on that day of the E-4B shown in LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT was absent from the 9/11 Commission report, has been denied by the military, and remained unknown to most until CNN (spurred by initial stories on the internet) gingerly touched upon the topic.  The repeated CNN footage of this giant military aircraft purposefully loop-the-looping in circles over Washington, at a time when the military command was elsewhere being taken unaware by the unfolding terrorist attack and reportedly learning of events, is dramatic.  (A 2008 book by Mark Gaffney, THE 9/11 MYSTERY PLANE AND THE VANISHING OF AMERICA, examines this story in further detail.)  In LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT, we see the activities of the E-4B in light of the complicated war-game maneuvers the Pentagon was conducting, simulating `unthinkable' terrorist attacks featuring terrorists flying airplanes into buildings.

The film examines the events that occurred at the Pentagon.  Norman Mineta, Transportation Secretary at the time, is shown giving testimony to Lee Hamilton at a hearing regarding Dick Cheney's unusual behavior on the morning of the attack.  An activist later chats to Mineta in public, on camera, and recounts back to him the Commission Report's written summary of what it suggests he actually said.  Mineta looks visibly surprised.  (The disquieting implications of Mineta's testimony regarding the former Vice President, and other accounts and reports that all support Mineta's version of events, are discussed at greater length in Chapters 12 and 13 of Peter Dale Scott's THE ROAD TO 9/11).  We see footage of casualties from the Pentagon being evacuated on stretchers.  Ray McGovern, a veteran CIA analyst, is eventually shown offering a frank assessment of Cheney that in a perfect world would be the highlight of upcoming 10th anniversary TV specials discussing the attacks in 2011, but which I suspect will be absent from those programs.

The film discusses the collapse of the towers in pointed detail.  We see a rapid montage of live-to-air witnesses from TV discussing the collapse of the buildings on the day of the attacks, the footage of which runs for nearly 5 minutes.  Witness after witness exclaims ""We heard explosions"", ""There was an explosion"", ""We just saw a big explosion"", and so on, and so on.  A reporter asks a policeman to clarify if he really witnessed an explosion, or just debris falling from the building.  The policeman repeats that it was an explosion, with a look on his face that now makes me wonder if he had realized then what so many people are still having trouble acknowledging now.

Indian Lake Borough mayor Barry Lichty discusses the events at Shanksville, and shakes his head with bemusement as he pages through the 9/11 Commission Report, reading (like Mineta) a version of events that does not match what he saw and heard that day. We also witness footage from 9/11 of rescue crew teams investigating the official Shanksville crash site.  One of the searchers on camera walks back and forth over the debris field, visibly perplexed at the lack of debris.  Attentive viewers may be just as bothered themselves.

Later in the film, a segment shows us the members of the 9/11 Commission, and highlights their relationships to various companies and organizations that benefited from the attacks and the subsequent war on terror.  The section concludes with a surreal shot of `Executive Director' Philip Zelikow, who, as now recorded by author Philip Shenon, told the commission exactly what he wanted the final report to say before they'd begun gathering any evidence.

An activist, furious at the stonewalling, back-patting and circuitous non-investigation conducted by the commission members, exits a hearing and angrily shouts comments as he departs.  The man's most pointed remark is used to conclude the end credits of this movie.  In the background of the soundtrack at that moment, you can hear the gathered crowd clapping.  When I first heard this, I thought the crowd was applauding the man for making the statement that he had just made.  Now, however, I realize that the crowd is applauding the fact that he is being removed from the room.  Under the range of circumstances covered by this movie, I think anyone who considers the substance of the man's statement will find the crowd's knee-jerk enthusiasm for his removal, on reflection, sad in a way that is hard to describe.

The film ends on a disquieting note, making points that I feel remain valid even though the key political suspects (an appropriate term) accused by the film no longer occupy the White House.  The end credits of the movie features poignant film clips - news footage, protesters, and footage newly shot by the filmmakers - over a hypnotic music track, with the lyrics commenting on the imagery.  One quick shot from this credit sequence features Barry Jennings, a witness to the WTC7 collapse who later had some additional, pointed things to say about what he saw that day (not featured in this movie, but highlighted in FABLED ENEMIES, a follow-up DVD from the same filmmakers).  FABLED ENEMIES is a good film, LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT a great one, but FABLED ENEMIES is still worth watching, especially as Jennings now lacks the ability to comment much further on these matters, even if he wanted to.

The DVD of this film is formatted in 16x9 format, and looks and sounds perfectly fine on my widescreen TV.  If I had to pick one movie to show someone receptive to thinking about - or, more accurately, rethinking - the events of 9/11, this would be it.  LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT is a formidable documentary accomplishment, and a friend of mine has noted that it really deserves to be broadcast in primetime on national TV.  The film maintains a strong emotional impact on me, even after multiple viewings.  I suggest that people watch it, then continue with several other films and additional books, so they can gain a deeper understanding of how all the various, complex pieces of information fit together.  After starting with LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT, I recommend watching 9/11 AND AMERICAN EMPIRE: INTELLECTUALS SPEAK OUT, then TERRORSTORM: SECOND EDITION.  (Both of these are also available on DVD from Amazon).  I'd suggest that viewers consider the footage in TERRORSTORM of newsreaders discussing the `mock terrorist drills' in London which occurred on the day of the 7/7 bombings.  Those scenes should be compared to the footage already noted from LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT where 9/11 Commission members shrug and disregard questions from the public regarding the similar, coincidental `mock terrorist drills' carried out by the US military on the day of the 9/11 attacks.  (`Vigilant Warrior' and `Vigilant Guardian' are two such drills.  LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT shows footage of Cynthia McKinney asking Joint Chiefs of Staff head Richard Myers to discuss them, and an audience member leaving a hearing in frustration when the commission members refuse to even acknowledge the issue.  Webster Tarpley offers a thoughtful analysis of those drills in the two-part DVD lecture `Facing the Truth about 9/11').  For books, I strongly recommend David Ray Griffin's DEBUNKING 9/11 DEBUNKING and THE NEW PEARL HARBOUR REVISTED.  Ian Henshall's more recent 9/11: THE NEW EVIDENCE is outstanding and offers a respected British journalist's viewpoint on the same issue.  Finally, Webster Tarpley's 9/11 SYNTHETIC TERROR is, along with Henshall's book, probably the best work yet written on the subject, and the numerous five star reviews it maintains here on Amazon are some indication of this.  In the meantime, do not miss LOOSE CHANGE FINAL CUT.",1238544000,27,11859,5.07157569515963

3396303,1,B0016N52IK,"This film is the end-result emesis of two conspiracy theory-obsessed frat boys who decided to throw together a paranoid fantasy for a film school class.

What garbage. These guys remind me of the members of the Flat Earth Society, but the Flat Earth people aren't offensive. LOOSE CHANGE presents us with the premise that the September 11th tragedy was somehow orchestrated by the Bush Administration, and that the deaths of 3,000 Americans that day were machinated to obtain some murky political gain.

The only thing that's really murky about LOOSE CHANGE is the gray matter of its creators, two ""9/11 Truthers,"" who ""prove"" with slanted and cherry-picked ""empirical evidence"" that commercial jets did not fly into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon, that the collapse of the towers was the result of a controlled detonation, and other such nonsense. This ""search for the truth"" only serves to discredit legitimate critics of Administration policies, and creates distractions that allow questionable governmental activities to go unchecked. How convenient for the leadership. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that Bushworld is subsidizing the costs of the constant remakes of this film.

First, the producers of LOOSE CHANGE endow the Bush Administration with a level of intelligence which would render them capable of formulating and then carrying out in absolute secrecy a huge, coordinated, and successful plan to disrupt the very Military-Industrial Complex that they control. This is the same bureaucracy that can't manage to mail out a universal tax stimulus check without losing tens of thousands of them.  The existence of such intelligence among them is a condition for which there is no proof.

Second, the creators of LOOSE CHANGE are not structural engineers, nor aircraft engineers, and their criticism that the mass of wreckage at the crash sites doesn't match the mass of the destroyed planes doesn't hold up in the face of physics. Immense kinetic energy was generated by the crashes, energy which vaporized the planes, the people, and critical portions of the massive structures of the World Trade Center and The Pentagon as though they were struck by a supernova. Simply put, the usual remnant evidence of a random plane crash is a chaos of flaming, twisted wreckage, but few plane crashes match these: Prior to 9/11, fully-laden jets were never intentionally aimed at and rammed into targets at 500 mph or more. The physical consequences of such collisions are something previously never seen. To say what should or shouldn't have occurred requires a level of omniscience these boys will never have.

More subjectively, this film is an insult to the memories of those who died that day, the rest of us who suffered, and to the common sense intelligence of a thinking audience.

No, kids, the planes didn't hit the towers. Amelia Earhart flew them to Paris, everyone aboard moved to the Rive Gauche, and they are all living in sin with Elvis and Jim Morrison at D.B. Cooper's house, atop a grassy knoll.

Spare me. A meaningful investigation about the Intelligence and communications failures of that day would be welcome. Instead, we get ""The Protocols of The Elders of Washington."" If Nine-Eleven taught us anything, it was this: Don't waste moments of your life watching this film; you won't get them back.",1220659200,26,3330,5.097247706422018

Loose change does not attempt to answer the many questions it just shows you the events prior and post to 9/11.

What planet do they live on, and in what world do they have the credibility to question, um, everybody, on whether 9/11 was really a terrorist attack?

What is sadder about these films, and indeed, this disturbingly large niche?  That this many people might believe these things?  That they take away good brains from actually figuring out how the world works and occupying them with complete bollocks?  That the Bush administration, rather than being totally incompetent, is capable of planning 9/11?  The 9/11 conspiracies and their theorists may be the most unfortunate outcome of Dubya's tenure.
