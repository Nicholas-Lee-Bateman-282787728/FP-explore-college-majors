8521089,4,B007QWRZ6C,What I like the most is that is succinct and easy to follow. What I don't like is I thought it is not long enough. I had hoped for at least an hour in length,1520121600,,157,3.5142857142857142

8521097,5,B007QWRZ6C,"Although this short DVD is only 16 minutes long, I gladly give it 5-stars.  It covers a lot of territory in those 16 minutes such as the parts of the dulcimer, replacing strings, tuning strings, the keyboard and fret positions and instruction in playing six tunes.  Three of those tunes are Amazing Grace, Angeline the Baker and Whiskey Before Breakfast.  The DVD utilizes a split screen approach, with standard notation and tablature at the top, and views of someone actually playing those tunes on the bottom half.  I am able to read music, so I thought tablature might be confusing.  But I can see where using both will help the learner initially.  Then, after getting the technique of playing this instrument down, the learner will have a choice as to which to use to memorize tunes.  Interestingly, the author described this instrument as ""a bagpipe with strings,"" as it gives a single melody over the strumming.  This is really a great starter for those wanting to learn the mountain dulcimer.",1392595200,17,999,4.8352941176470585
