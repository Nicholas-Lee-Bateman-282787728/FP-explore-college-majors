3856798,4,B0026RLMBG,"The History channel had humble beginnings, well, actually from the start it had top notch programs!  Launched in 1995 it has made a lot of original programing, I wouldn't be surprised if they had so many that they couldn't show them all in a year.  I read what this set came with and I realized that some I watch every October on the History channel, some that I thought I had seen in the past, and most I had never seen.  I was correct, a lot of these shows, although made with top quality production, just aren't aired anymore on TV so this is the only way to watch them.  I haven't watched them all, mostly I want to save them for around Halloween, but the ones I have are the oldest and saw like 10 years ago and have since wanted to watch them again but like I said the History Channel just has too much new stuff that they need to show so these old yet excellent shows get left out.

I'm taking 1 star off because of the quality.  It is understandable that these are DVDs and were filmed before HD but on a HDTV they don't look good as they are interlaced.  If you have an upscaling DVD player they look better but what I would recommend doing is ripping them with Handbrake as 'High Profile', that cleans them up a ton and makes them more watchable on a new HDTV.  I do this to all my DVDs though, I like to have the file and watch it through a computer plugged into my HDTV through HDMI.  This way I don't have to go through DVD menus and I don't have to switch out disks.  With the quality I ripped them to all 20 combined were 16.1 GB which isn't much.  Now in October I can make a play-list and watch on here and one there to get into the Halloween spirit and no worrying about scratching DVDs.",1276214400,4,1705,4.105421686746988
3856799,3,B0026RLMBG,"Some of the discs were interesting, some were downright boring. The ""haunted"" and ""paranormal"" discs mostly cover the history of the area or the spirits thought to be there. They offer no proof of the hauntings. However the vampire, Vlad, voodoo, and zombie discs were interesting although limited in scope and coverage. Only so-so. I was expecting more from a History channel series.",1264809600,9,384,5.111111111111111

8353491,5,B0026RLMBG,"In an age when gore-filled chopfest marathons are supposed to pass as ""holiday fare"" whenever the Halloween season comes around , this set offers a little something for everybody! Some content may not be too adviseable for children under , say ...age 7 or so , most of you will find the majority of these dvds can be enjoyed by the whole family. All the while , still offering up some of the most creepy , atmospheric and (GASP!) informative entertainment they could put together in one set.

I don't think I have seen any other dvd collection that can even come close to giving viewers such spooky goodness at such a value! The quality in video still holds up well and the sound is great , but most importantly , the fun is still crammed into each and every episode. Nothing has been cut from its original airing on television , and although theres no dvd extras contained in this set , it more than makes up for trust me!

If you're looking for something for the Halloween season , or are just a fan as I am of the supernatural side of the world we live in , you cannot go wrong in purchasing this set! Sit back , enjoy the shows in any order you want and as Bill Cosby was so fond of saying at the beginning the Fat Albert show ""You might just learn something in the process!""",1318291200,,1279,4.2592592592592595
8353492,3,B0026RLMBG,"In 1999 back when I was in high school, before many other channels started programming shows about ghostly phenomenon; the History Channel began airing a show spectral enthusiasts like myself gravitated toward. This was ""Haunted History"", a series of documentaries that chronicled the haunted happenings of a different state or city with each episode, and the history behind them. When I initially read that this was the complete ""Megaset"", I thought that the show I had grown up watching every Friday night had finally released a box set inclusive of each episode that aired as a part of that series. I WAS WRONG!!!

Sure, I had trepidation about getting this series for fear that it would have that random hodgepodge of documentaries that aired as part of either some old show on A&E channel, or others that were part of ""Histories Mysteries"", like the 5-Disc box set I had previously bought. But then I sat in denial thinking, ""This is 'Haunted History' as it clearly says in the title! The History Channel would put out a 'Megaset' if it wasn't inclusive of all the states they documented in that series; they wouldn't do that to me!"". Yeah...to my chagrin, I was wrong and I bought this and realized that they had indeed mislead me to thinking that this was the series that focused on state-by-state (or country) hauntings and it most definitely is NOT. There are only about 5 selected episodes of that series included here and they are some  of the most lamest ones like Hawaii (who cares!) and Tombstone (annoying because of that damn guitar playing guy who is used to segue into the next story; Why!?). However, you do get Chicago, Washington D.C. and the Haunted History of Halloween which were all good.

Had this been the whole series inclusive of the better shows like New England, Hollywood, London, and New York; I would have been greatly satisfied and drooling with praise about my purchase. However this wasn't a wise investment, because all the other documentaries included in this set are either redundant (Salem, Mass and Vampires) or semi-boring after one viewing (Voodoo, Exorcisms, and the old A&E Haunted House documentaries that are edited in such a sensationalist manner it tunes me out). Plus, having bought the 5-Disc set in the past, I'm left feeling remorseful as this includes most if not all of those titles. In short, if you are like me and were expecting the whole series of the actual ""Haunted History""; DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SET! However, if you are content with owning a myriad of titles from different series and channels, then by all means dump this in your cart and watch those dollars disappear via your online bank account.",1311897600,26,2663,4.822757111597374
8353493,4,B0026RLMBG,For the price this is a great collection of stories and myths about hauntings all over the world. You can tell some were filmed some time ago so the quality isn't the best but like I always say you get what you pay for. This is a great addition to my video library and perfect for a Halloween night or anytime.,1302739200,3,310,4.098360655737705
