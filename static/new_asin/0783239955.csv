58994,4,0783239955,"This is a pleasant, well-executed farce reminiscent of Almodovar.  Just so you know, though, the dinner game itself really isn't the focus.  It isn't  actually shown on screen.  It's too bad, because it's a great premise that  isn't really realized the way I imagined based on how the movie was  described to me.  Fun movie though.",966470400,2,331,4.803571428571429
58995,5,0783239955,"This French film invites you in with its intriguing premise, then butters you up with sardonic wit.  Don't let its brevity (under an hour and half) or its 'simplicity' fool you...the screenplay has real bite.
What is  the Dinner Game, you ask?  Well, imagine that you had to find the biggest  idiot you know and invite them to dinner along with all the other idiots  your friends had gathered.  These unwitting idiots would then become fodder  for your arrogance as you chose who, indeed, was the most idiotic of  all.
Now, turn the tables on that dinner game, and imagine that you were  the invited 'guest.'  What an honor, oh my!
As you watch this film you  may see yourself in both the arrogant and the fools, but you will not be  disappointed by the realizations that come to each character's mind.  Lessons are learned, the depth of idiocy is explored, and the cruel fruits  of the proud intelligensia are served up for all to indulge.
Go ahead,  laugh and cringe, but don't forget to ask yourself which side of the game  you'd be on.  ""Who's for dinner?""  Is the question for you to ask  or to answer?
Only the French could come up with such simply eloquent  cuisine!",963187200,3,1173,4.521531100478469
58996,5,0783239955,"The Dinner Game is an outstanding comedy in which poetic justice reigns supreme. The premise of the movie centers around a twisted game in which elite Frenchmen compete to invite the most idiotic people they can possibly  find to a weekly dinner party.
The movie focuses on two main characters;  Pierre, a French executive, and the idiot he invited to the dinner. Pierre  cancels out of the dinner party due to a back injury, and through several  circumstantial slip-ups, ends up spending the evening in his apartment with  his idiotic guest. Pierre's life is then systematically destroyed in a long  series of mistakes and blunders as his well intentioned, but stupid guest,  tries to help him through the evening.
This film is a mixture of  cultural and situational comedy. The humor is definitely French, and will  probably appeal more to people who've spent some time dealing with the  stereotypes portrayed in this movie (intellectual elitists / tax collectors  / bureaucrats). Having said that, the movie should also appeal to the  American audience. While the humor isn't slapstick or joke based, it is  certainly one of the best comedy of errors I've seen in some time. An  excellent French movie, and a welcome departure from the more crass MTV  style comedies of late. If you like French movies, you'll enjoy The Dinner  Game.",963187200,,1336,4.95045045045045
58997,5,0783239955,"I first saw this movie at the Taos Talking Pictures Film Festival in 1999. It had the whole audience laughing hysterically, me included.
The humor is based on comedy of errors. I don't think I quite agree with the review  that says this movie has a reserved sense of humor. The reason some may  believe that is that this is not slapstick, punchline type of humor.  Instead, your laughing as the situation gets worse and worse and worse  through the character's confusions and bad judgements.
The plot is  interesting. Four buddies have a ""dinner game"" every week, in  which they invite the worst (best?) idiot that can be found. The one who  brings the most idiotic person, wins. It is interesting how serious each  pursue their idiots. Some go so far as to ""network"" and send  agents on the look out for an idiot. But the idiot that takes the cake and  the co-starring role in this movie is quite the nice guy, if a bit on the  bumbling fool side. He just has a weird passion: building matchstick models  of famous buildings like the Eiffel Tower. He is Pierre's idiot for the  Wednesday dinner.
Unfortunately, Pierre severely hurts his back playing  golf that day and must cancel his appearance at the idiot dinner. But when  the idiot stops by, he becomes so concerned for Pierre and his hurt back  that he sticks around and tries to ""help"" him out.
And that is  where everything truly falls apart.
You may have to have some initial  patience if you are looking for the imediate funnies. It doesn't start to  get crazy until about 30 minutes into the film.
This is one of those  movies that you can see dozens of times and keep laughing. I have.",960163200,113,1648,4.522033898305085

Those people with a great taste of real humor, YOU  WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. It's about this guy who has a dinner party with his  friends and the friends invite the most boring idiotic people to the  dinner. One of the guy's friend's gets injured, not the idiot. and can't go  to the dinner. so the idiot stays home making all the trouble for the guy.  the idiot finds out that he was invited for the dinner just for a laugh.  the idiot is a real idiot, i mean a REAL IDIOT. I laughed from beginning to  end, not one part of the movie wasen't funney. TO BE A 100% HONEST THIS IS  THE ONLY MOVIE I SAW THAT I DID NOT STOP LAUGHING. ALL THE OTHER GOOD  COMEDY MOVIES I SAW WERE FUNNEY, BUT NOT EVERY SECOND FROM BEGINNING TO END  AND MOST OF THE COMEDYS I'VE SEEN GET REAL BORING. THIS IS THE ONLY COMEDY  I'VE EVER SEEN THAT DID NOT GET BORING ONCE. GET THE MOVIE OR YOU ARE  REALLY MISSING OUT.

The dialogue is excellent.  I don't speak French so I was limited to the subtitles.  Normally, I find this annoying but, in this case, I didn't even notice.

59060,4,0783239955,"Yeah, like the old song went fools rush in where angels fear to tread but in the comedy of errors under review, Francis Vebers The Dinner Game in French with English subtitles, one is never quite sure, at least of the characters on the screen, who the fool is and who should have paid attention when those damn angels stayed away. This one is an hour and twenty minutes of guessing just who is the fool and who is being taken in. In places a bit heavy-handed with some too intricate or implausible occurrences but overall worth your time if you have the time to spare.

Heres why I, for one, am wondering who the fool was. One Brochant, a prominent bourgeois publisher belongs to an exclusive club of prominent businessmen who, having apparently nothing better to do, have an idiots night at their weekly soirees. This idiot business for the seemingly chic and high-toned members is for each one to bring an idiot to the meeting and have the various guests compete, unknown to them, for the champion idiot of the night. Yeah, already I can see you are rooting for the idiots just like I was on this one.

These idiots, harmless men like the star of  the film, Pignon, an employee of the Finance Ministry, a tax guy okay, who had a maybe outsized  passion for building replicas of famous landmarks-out of match sticks  are the kind of contestants for the meetings. So the question of idiot might be just a bit overplayed by the club members. In any case the fools, the club members that is, have talent spotters searching Paris for appropriate candidates. That was how Brochant wound up with Pignon. Old Brochant would come to rue the day that he went up against old Pignon and that is where the comedy of errors come in. Prior to meeting Pignon he had had a back injury that put him out of whack and in the end would depend on our tax guy to get around. Would also come to depend on Pignon trying to find out where his estranged wife was after she could not, rightly, persuade him to give up the juvenile activities around idiot night. One thing Pignon did as the errors escalated was to expose Brochants mistress to his wife. Oops! For other such mishaps on the way to resolving the relationship between Brochant and Pignon watch this one.  Yeah, fools rush in.",1469750400,,2262,4.4914841849148415

59121,5,0783239955,"First off, I just want to say that I love movies.  I own hundreds of blu-rays and just can't seem to get enough.  My girlfriend recommended this movie to me the other day and I thought, ""why not?""  This ranks up there with some of the best comedies I have ever seen (I have seen them all) and I haven't laughed that hard in a very long time.

I will never forget this movie.  The things that made it so perfect and unique were:

1. I watched it with subtitles and even then the jokes did not lose any humor.
2. Every actor's subtle idiosyncrasies fit their movie character perfectly.  This is either a hats off to the actors or to the casting director.  It just made the movie not feel like a movie and I never had a conscious thought to analyze the acting at any point in the movie....AND IT WAS ONLY ACTING.  No CGI, no special effects, no big budget.  This leads me into the next great feature of this movie.
3. I did not know this until it was pointed out to me by my girlfriend (who previously has watched the movie) but the movie was literally filmed in pretty much four different rooms either in a house or a building.
4. The script for this movie portrays characters that anyone can relate to people in their lives which is another source of entertainment that this movie gives its audience.
5. This movie gives humor ""class"".  No jokes are too raunchy and there is a lot of situation based humor.  I went into watching the movie feeling bad about the ""idiot"" and in my life I have stuck up for a lot of people in situations like that.  This movie was very light-hearted about it and allowed me to laugh; free of guilt.

I will definitely be looking for more movies by the group (actors/writers/directors) that created this movie.",1424649600,2,1738,4.340557275541796

Let me say I do enjoy French films immensely. I am a big Francis Veber fan, loving ""The Closet,"" ""Les Comperes"" and most recently ""The Valet."" This was highly reviewed but I have to say it was not as funny as I expected.

The film is about misunderstandings and a man who doesn't have much common sense. He keeps getting our protagonist into a deep hole by basically ruining his marriage, getting him audited and just being a plain ole nuissance. You'll hate Pignon but the minute you think ""can this man be any stupider?"" he does something amazing and you like him....for a minute!

Again the film is recommendable, especially if you enjoy French humor, but this is not Veber's best, at least not in my opinion.",1326412800,2,935,4.398843930635838

Really.....it being a FRENCH MOVIE makes people excuse the obscurity of real humor. Somebody compared it to Peter Sellers comedies....I have all of his films, none can be compared to this garbage.

This Movie is Hilarious. I was laughing on full power as I watched the little guy making mistakes like putting alcohol in the eggs...
Or never left the other guy alone and always tried to help him.
This was even funnier than my other kid's movies like Cats and Dogs or Furry Vengeance.

I grew up in Ukraine where French comedies were extremely popular instead of the usual American pie-in-the face, fart, toilet humor jokes so perhaps I have a different take on this.  This film is brilliant in the most typical French comedy way.  It's subtle and funny and quirky but at the end of the film I feel like all is right since these French comedies usually come full circle.  The Dinner Game is a personal favorite of mine because of all the twists and turns in it and the lessons to be taken from this script.  It's witty and quirky and everything that a French comedy should be.  5 stars all the way and I wish more Americans would appreciate this particular genre.",1310428800,7,902,4.359281437125748

59159,3,0783239955,"Francis Veber's Le Diner de Cons/The Dinner Game has been on the slate for a US remake for so long that Bollywood beat them to it with Bheja Fry/Home Delivery. It's not Veber's funniest film by a long way and at times it plays like a filmed theatrical farce (which, in fairness, it is), but in a good way as Thierry Lhermitte's arrogant publisher tries to find the perfect idiot for his friends' weekly dinner for schmucks, where each brings an idiot they hope will be even more idiotic than those the other guests bring. Faced with heavy competition from a friend's boomerang collector, unfortunately the idiot he finds - Jacques Villeret's Francois Pignon - is TOO perfect, and promptly sets about inadvertently destroying his life with the minimum of effort. Lhermitte is the perfect straight man for Villeret's puppydogish performance - at one point he even hides in the corner like a puppy that's just peed on the rug - though the biggest laugh goes to Daniel Prevost's tax inspector who is drawn into the maelstrom with an ill-advised favor that has disastrous consequences. Veber is smart enough to mock the obvious moral of the tale, and at a brisk 80 minutes it never stretches the thin material to breaking point. Perhaps not a classic, but a very pleasant and frequently delightful diversion.

Pierre Brochant, an upper middle class French publisher, participates in a weekly dinner party with several of his buddies in which they each invite an, unknowing, idiot to dinner for their amusement. It's not unlike the ""Ugly Girl"" contest they enjoyed in college.

Brochant invites Franois Pignon (a character that also appears in other Veber comedies), a model builder that makes models of engineering structures like the Eiffel Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge out of matchsticks, as his dinner guest.

Prior to dinner, Brochant asks Pignon to his elegant Paris apartment to get to know him better before displaying him at the ""idiots' dinner"". Unfortunately, Pignon arrives just as Brochant's wife walks out on him. Having had a similar experience, Pignon can empathize and sincerely tries to help his new friend.

Being the idiot that he is, Pignon continues to make matters worse for Brochant by his continuous and hilarious bungling. Pignon proves that he truly is an idiot although always sincere and well intentioned.

Along the way Pignon learns the true reason he was invited to dinner and is deeply hurt. Despite his humiliation and anger, Pignon is able to rise to the occasion and help is non-friend by convincing Brochant's wife on the phone to return to her husband. For that moment, Pignon is the smart one and Brochant realizes that he is the real idiot. But, will Pignon blow it; watch and find out.

There is no nudity, and there are no ""bedroom scenes""; but the plot does center around the habit of many Frenchmen of having a wife and a mistress, and there is some language.

Perhaps it was the chance in a second viewing to study the characters more than the plot, whereby Monsieur Pignon appeared too affectionate and likeable to ridicule for sport.  I might have even tweaked the ending to inflict the final comeuppance on Pierre Brochant with NO help at all from Pignon.  But then I reminded myself that THIS IS AFTERALL JUST A FARCE, with Pignon in the end no less a fool than, say, Stan of ""Laurel & Hardy"" or Norton of ""The Honeymooners"".  And no less so than previously, I found myself getting caught up in the sequence of comic errors that continued to build upon itself.  The inclusion of Pignon's boss for collateral victimhood added an extra dimension to his role in that sequence.

I had forgotten about it until I was watching 'Volver' and they had trailers for other movies including 'The Valet' which is also by the same director as Le Diner de Cons. Remembering how much joy it brought to me I ordered it and I have no regrets. After reading other reviews for this movie here I have to now get 'The Closet' as well. Le Diner de Cons is French farce at its very best and although my French has gone the way of the dodo with lack of practice it is still enjoyable for non-French speakers. I recommend like a beastly cold beer on a hot and sunny day!",1184198400,4,1266,4.192622950819672

All of the action takes place in the swank apartment of the protagantist, who is ultimately reduced to admiting that the idiot he has invited to dinner has human qualities that cannot be vouchsafed.  On the way to this realization, though, our poor hero is betrayed again and again by the stupidity of his idiot.  The pinnacle comes when the idiot's workmate (who else?) discovers who's wife is sleeping with whom.  Worth twice the price Amazon is charging.",1178668800,2,595,5.092783505154639

59189,4,0783239955,"A group of well-to-do snobbish and obnoxious professionals have dinner parties every Wednesday to which each of them is required to bring an ""idiot"" as a guest. The victims have no idea that they are invited merely to be humiliated and their boorish ""sponsors"" compare their notes later to determine whose ""idiot"" was the best. Pierre Brochant( Thierry Lhermitte), the smug publisher thinks that he's got a winner in the tax accountant Franois Pignon (Jacques Villeret, sadly passed away in January 2005 - great French Comedian whose performance in ""Robert and Robert"" I enjoyed very much) who reproduces the famous landmarks with the matchsticks and would talk about them with never ending enthusiasm. Unfortunately for Pierre (but fortunately for us, the viewers) he throws his back just before the dinner and has to rely to Pignon's sincere generosity. The tables are turned and look who is an idiot after all...

With the modest running time of 80 minutes, the ""Dinner Game"" is a delightful and very funny comedy. I would not expect anything else from Francis Veber, the director of Le Jouet, (1976) aka The Toy , La Chvre, (1981) aka Knock On Wood, Les Compres, (1983) ... aka ComDads, and Les Fugitifs, (1986) and the writer for Le Grand blond avec une chaussure noire, (1972) ... aka The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe.

The simple plot concerns a man, Pierre, who attends a mean-spirited ""idiot dinner"" every week where each regular attendee must bring the stupidest person they can find.  Pierre strikes gold when he meets Fran?ois, who reconstructs famous architecture out of matchsticks.  However, before they can get to the dinner, Pierre throws his back out, and every effort Fran?ois (who doesn't know the real reason he was invited to dinner) makes to help Pierre backfires drastically and hilariously.

What could be a hard-to-watch film about people's cruelty to each other instead becomes a delicious comedy of errors as, in the course of one evening, the endearing Fran?ois keeps bungling various aspects of Pierre's life such as his marriage, finances, friendships, and involvement with a nymphomaniac.

I've seen this movie so many times that I don't even need the subtitles anymore because I have it all memorized. For subtitle-wary folks, this movie is well worth getting over that - My ex's 9 year old son used to beg us to watch it. Why? Because this is definitely one of the most exquisitely hilarious movies I have ever seen. It's not what one would reffer to as mindlessly funny or stupid/goofy funny, it's funny because of the intelligently subtle comic timing, great writing and direction, and the chemistry between the main characters. Lhermitte's ability to say so much with just a look will have viewers laughing throughout the movie. Pignon, the  bumbling, well-meaning but oft disasterous character brings the movie to a level of hilarity that will make you laugh until you cry. (Not to give anything away, but the ending of a phone call that Pignon makes proves to be the biggest laugh in the movie and one that will go down in cimenatic history)They are supported by a cast with perfect comic timing and a well developed story with surprises.

59203,5,0783239955,"If you liked Francis Verber's ""The Closest"" (featuring what can only be described as France's All-Star Acting Team), then you must seek out his serio-comic masterpiece ""The Dinner Game.""  Verber adapted his self-penned play for the screen and had the good sense to cast the play's long-running star, Jacques Villeret, as his 'idiot' foil, Franois Pignon (interestingly carrying the same name as Verber's protagonist in ""The Closet"" but played there by Daniel Auteuil).  Villeret - who passed away of a cerebral hemorrhage in January 2005 - was renowned in his homeland for this classic portrayal.  No description here can do it justice.

Verber has a top-notch stable of actors that he uses in both films, most notably France's ""leading leading man"" Thierry Lhermitte (as Pierre Brochant) and the beautiful and classy Alexandra Vandernoot as his on-screen wife.  As befits a screenplay adapted faithfully from a play, the action - well over 80% of it - takes place in one room (the living area of the Brochants' well-appointed apartment).

The title of the film (and play) is a bit of a head-fake.  Due to unforeseen events, Brochant and Pignon never make it to the idiot dinner.  Or, maybe they do.  You be the judge.

Of special note here are the outstanding English sub-titles.  The movie is filled with intricate and hilarious wordplay, the gist of which is that Pignon misunderstands the nuances of things and hilarity ensues.  It's quite a feat to get that type of humor to translate across a language barrier, but the filmmakers and their distributors (helped immeasurably by Villeret's classic deadpan takes) have succeeded in spades.",1124236800,9,1642,5.063197026022305

59211,3,0783239955,"I agree: there are some good laughs in this film, especially as it warms up after the first half hour. That said, it left me with a quibble and with a slight off taste.
First, the quibble -- unlikely to have bothered most people. The premise is that the snobs invite an idiot to dinner each week, but the film has a bit of an odd notion of where to look for idiots. Why does Pignon get picked? Because he has an obsession -- just like the boomerang man in one of the opening scenes. In Pignon's case, the obsession is making meticulous scale models of bridges, buildings, the Eiffel Tower... out of matchsticks. But weird hobbies and peculiar obsessions aren't the same as stupidity.
As it turns out, Pignon doesn't disappoint. Not only is he obsessed; he's also clueless. But that's where the off taste comes in. We don't have any sympathy for Pierre, the snob who invites Pignon to his house, but nonetheless, the movie puts the audience in the place of the would-have-been dinner guests: we get our laughs as much at Pignon's expense as from looking down on his host. There's one brief moment of humanity at the very end, but the screenplay immediately takes it back.
The reply, I suppose, is that it's a comedy, for heaven's sake! True enough; we aren't watching it to be edified. But the film would be cleverer if the audience got its own come-uppance.",1073001600,11,1357,4.542857142857143

59213,5,0783239955,"From Cocteau and Renoir to Besson and Ozon, French cinema has earned its deserved place as one of the best in the world. The Nouvelle Vague started by a group of film critics, among them were Truffaut and Goddard, who were unhappy by the then state of cinema and wanted a change that they saw was not forthcoming too soon, so they went on and did their own movies and in the process forever changed the way films are directed, written, edited and as equally important analyzed too.
It is the cinema that Hollywood often seeks refuge in when original ideas have dried up,to remake and readapt classic films.
However, unlike in Britain and America,French cinema did not excel in all genres.
Science fiction and horror are almost non existant, and thrillers are few and far between nowadays,while action movies were only given a recent revival by the likes of Besson,(influenced by Hollywood and taking advantage of the new advances in the technology).Instead what French cinema excelled in were the drama/romance and comedy genres. Strangely only the latter remained largely confined to France and the francophone countries,although with actors like Fernandel, Pierre Richard, Bouvril, 'Les Charlots' and the genuis that was Louis De Funes,and directors like Claude Zidi and Gerard Oury, the output was very rich and funny.
Not until Dinner Game that is.
Francis Veber, another brilliant comedy writer/director who was responsible for classic hits (many remade by Hollywood, such as the Toy, the Man with one Red Shoe, and The Fugitives),managed finally with The Dinner Game to take French comedies from the confines of the domestic market and of very few enthusiasts around the globe, to worldwide commercial fame.
And in a way it is an inevitable outcome, for The Dinner Game is one of the best written comedy of all time in any language,and this where the secret of its success firmly lies: The writing.
Francois Pignon, the character that Veber invented and used in his earlier movies with Pierre Richard in La Chevre and Les Comperes, is the main ingredient of the success behind The Dinner Game.
A lonely person,down on his luck, with failed or non existant relationships,clumsy, getting himself and others into deep trouble, but with a heart of gold,always trying to help as best as he knows how, or trying at least to redress the difficult situation he put himself in.
This of course brings out many laughs, but there is a twist.
Unlike most characters in comedies, Francois Pignon, and especially in The Dinner Game is a much more complex person that it seems. The character is multi-layered, and the funny Pignon we laugh so much with, hides also a sadness we see glimpses of in his eyes, not too long to ruin the comic pace, but just enough to give him enough depth and poignancy. This is why underneath all the fun, we sympathize closely with Pignon, turning him into a small champion. As is the norm in French Cinema, there is a lot of analytical/psychological, three dimensional approach to their characters, even in comedies.
And of course, there is so much laughter in this movie. The situation comedy can not get any better. From the very start,
A group of well to do obnoxious 'yuppies' like to invite 'idiots' to a dinner and make fun of and  humiliate, just for quicks. Thierry Lhermitte, a member of this group, however will soon bite much more than he can chew, nearly ruining his life when he meets his new 'idiot', Francois Pignon, played perfectly by Jacques Villeret. I believe he is the best Pignon! His expressions, his childish enthusiasm, geniune regret, twisted problem solving and reasoning, are so well portrayed on screen.
The beauty of Dinner Game is the fact that at the end, Pignon, who represent a silent majority triumphs against all odds, and the ones whom society always applauds: the rich, strong,powerful,and priviledged have been put in their right place, if only temporarily.
This makes Dinner Game one of the best comedies ever written, it will make you laugh no matter how many times you watch it,but it offers much much more, and this is the secret of its success and with it French Cinema.",1065052800,39,4136,4.866666666666666
59214,4,0783239955,"After reading postive reviews on [Amazon.com] about this movie, I decided to check it out for myself.  This is a great movie!  The set up is as follows...a group of guys get together once a week and they have to bring the biggest idiot they can find to a dinner party.  Whoever brings the biggest idiot wins.  Thing is, the people who they consider idiots are completely unaware of the contest.  This is similiar to college fraternities having an ugly girl contest, where each member has to find the ugliest girl they can, and bring her to the party.
Anyway, Pierre Brochant, played by Thierry Lhermitte, finds what he believes is the all time supreme idiot in Francois Pignon, played by Jacques Villeret.  Francois particular specialty is constructing elaborate replicas of famous landmarks out of toothpicks.  Pierre, who is a publisher, invites Francois to the dinner under the guise of the possibility of doing a book with regards to his models.  Francois meets Pierre at Pierre's apartment, and the comedy ensues.  It's not slapsticky comedy, but intelligent fare, as we see a fairly detestable individual, Pierre, get what he deserves back in spades as things just keep going wrong.  Francois appears to be a harmless, nebbish sort of fellow, but the more he tries to help his new 'friend' Pierre, the worse things just seem to get.
The pacing was excellent, and the humor right on the mark.  Given the popularity of this movie in France, I wouldn't be suprised to see Hollywood attempt to remake this movie, but as we've seen before, so often these remakes tend to lose the charm and originality as American producers and executives decide how best to 'improve' on a movie because they are so in tune with what American audiences like.",1062547200,40,1742,4.8120805369127515

59218,5,0783239955,"I came in on the middle of this film on HBO one afternoon while flipping through channels.  I paused for a moment, got hooked, and spent the next hour laughing like a crazed fool.  This is perhaps the funniest movie I have seen in the past decade.  When you think it can't get any worse for the main character, or any funnier, it does!  Having missed the first 30 minutes on HBO, I rushed out to buy the DVD, and have enjoyed watching this film again and again.  It's PG-13, namely because of a few bad words and some content dealing with adultery.",1032998400,15,548,4.281553398058253
59219,5,0783239955,"Franois (Jacques Villeret) is invited by Pierre (Thierry Lhermitte) to a dinner party, which is a front for a cruel joke that Pierre and his friends frequently play.  The joke is a contest to see who can bring the greatest idiot to the dinner.  Pierre injures his back before the dinner and it seems like Pierre has to cancel the dinner with Franois. Nevertheless, Franois appears to be to good to be true, and he is rather difficult to get rid off.  The Diner Game delivers an unexpected comedy experience that is performed by an excellent cast.",1027987200,3,546,4.608247422680412
59220,5,0783239955,"The Dinner Game is a movie not-based on an unfamilar premise: a group of snobby French men have a dinner to see who can invite the biggest idiot. The person who brings the biggest idiot to the dinner is deemed the winner. This concept has been done before however Thierry Lhermitte's take on this theme is done with class, spunk, and wit so much so that it will leave you enjoying every minute of this movie. This was the best *comedy* that I saw in 2000, period and is not slap-stick nor high-school comedy which has been popularized by American Pie and American Pie 2. People of all ages can appreciate this movie, even your mom or dad who are always doubting your taste in movies! :) I highly recommend you purchase or rent this movie.",1000857600,3,738,4.4338235294117645
59221,5,0783239955,"I am not a fan of comedies- in fact, I hesitated to get, ""Le diner de cons"" (The Dinner Game) until I read other reviews and heard what a few French friends thought about this film. It is not at all the comedy you'd expect- so funny- laugh out loud funny but down to earth with a few moral messages hidden within the script. In many ways, it is easy to relate to each character's pros and cons. What a wonderful way to teach about man's flaws and more importantly, how we treat one another- through laughter-a modern Molire, maybe? Now, I want to see all of Veber's movies. This is an excellent film.",1000684800,4,600,4.271929824561403
59222,5,0783239955,"This French movie with English subtitles is a true farce, making one laugh and laugh again. It has caught the eye of the filmgoers, even those who hate the subtitled movies. The plot revolves round a Dinner Game about which almost every character speaks, a dinner at which a few innocent people assumed to be idiots, would become the fodder for the entertainment of a group of gentlemen. Who are the true idiots? The arrogant or the innocent? The movie asks a relevant question, while making everyone laugh. Indeed a French masterpiece!",998438400,5,536,4.836956521739131

My husband and I saw it in the theatre, and we were BOTH screaming with laughter.  Later, when it was released on video, we rented it.  Amazingly, it was just as funny the second time around, which says a lot.  Most comedies are lucky to be funny once.  This is one to buy!",988848000,5,429,4.222222222222222

59228,4,0783239955,"Do you want be happy 80 minutes? This movie is a big amusement.
Ok, this is not a movie, but a theatre work; ok, we can be afraid to be again guest of somebody; ok, it's not usual, nowadays, show a stupid man in this way...
But who is the victim, really? The poor idiot or the ""normal""?
When we think about stupidity usually we remember some stupid actions, probably by almost normal person. This is a dangerous error!
We have to remember that the real idiot is a perfect entity, nobody can defend himself against a real idiot. He is strong, always euphoric, determined, never tired, never resting, and the worst thin you can find is when the real idiot  decides to help you!
Jacques Villeret is a wonderful Francois Pignon, the idiot; the script of this movie makes him like a real Emperor, in his speciality.
At last, you will understand and forgive Brochant, the man who has invited Pignon at the ""dinner of idiots"", because Pignon destroys definitively his life only in an hour and some minutes.",979171200,2,999,4.55

7790448,3,0783239955,"""Le Dner de Cons"" (1998) - ""The Dinner Game"" written and directed by Francis Veber once again he uses a character named Francois Pignon, played in this film by Jacques Villere which is typical of Francis Veber.  This is basically a story about a man being invited to a dinner party not because he is interesting but unknowingly to him because he is preceived as a loser who is being invited to make fun of.  I am only giving this Veber film three stars as it does not come close to some of his other films.  I would top the list with ""Le placard"" (2001) aka, ""The Closet"" (2001) starring Daniel Auteuil as Francois Pignon.  The second best I would say is ""La doublure"" aka, ""The Valet"" (2006).  Other films by Francis Veber that also have a Francois Pignon character who is never the same Francois Pignon are ""Les comp&egrave;res""(1983) aka, The ComDads and ""L'emmerdeur"" (1973) & (2008) aka, ""A Pain in the Ass"".  I hope this helps if you like French comedies.",1486339200,2,961,4.526011560693641
