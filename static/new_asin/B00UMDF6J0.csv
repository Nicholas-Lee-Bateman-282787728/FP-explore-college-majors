I'm a huge fan of UK TV (i.e. Luther, Ripper Street, Jack Taylor, Wallander), but the season 4, if you can call two episodes a season, of Luther wasn't as good as the previous ones. I did not like how they killed Alice Morgan off. Her character was highly intelligent and don't think she would have fallen into the predicament she found herself in. I would surely love to see more seasons or a series of Luther movies. Idris Elba is at his best when portraying this character and can watch the seasons over and over again.",1469491200,,545,4.352941176470588

I thought she was one of the great psycho characters in recent memory and the replacement character just didn't do it. It would be nice to see another set of shows and I read there may be a movie.

Part of the magic of the show was the chemistry between Idris Elba and everybody's favorite femme fatale Ruth Wilson, And now people are reviewing the all too short 4th season as if she's actually dead??

 If you are one of these people I have some beach front property in Nebraska I would love to sell you.

Now how does one get through the wait until next season?.

BTW season 4 was slightly lacking only in the sense that Alice Morgan didn't show up.  I'll bet you a month's pay you are in for a surprise next season which I think we can all agree should be at least 13 one hour episodes long.  Fantastic stuff.",1462752000,,695,4.3

7052591,4,B00UMDF6J0,"Luther Series 4 is a bit of an odd name, as does two episodes really make a series?  They could have just combined the two episodes and called this Luther verse the Cannibal, or Luther the movie or something, as the two episodes go for just under two hours, which a fair few movies reach in duration these days.  They are pretty good episodes and the events do pick up from season 3, so you are best to watch that first, well the whole series of seasons from the start to really get into this one.  Basically Luther has been contacted at some remote cliff top house he's sort of retired to, where two police visit him (one DS Emma Lane being played by Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones) and tell him of the murder of a main character from the prior seasons.  Luther of course decides to investigate her murder his own way which isn't the way a normal follow the rules police officer does, but when he's got some mob lord chained to a heater his phone rings.  It's one of the two officers asking his advice, and to say the phone call doesn't go well for the caller is an understatement.  So Luther puts the suit back on and arrives at the crime scene asking what does he need to sign to be officially involved.  He takes the lead and together with DS Lane, are on the trail of creepy guy who likes to eat different body parts of each of his victims.

The show was a bit annoying how even though there were just two episodes we still had the next week on Luther clip before the first episode's credits.  The fact we even have credits on a play all feature is something I find annoying.  They should have just combined them or had both at the end.",1461715200,,1643,4.220447284345048

Idris Elba is great in whatever he does, but this was a bit too disjointed and overly sensationalized, and the while situation with Alice is really stretching disbelief too far. Patrick Malahide was great as the head of a criminal gang. Hope they make another series but with the entire original cast and less American-ized serial killer material like 'Hannibal'.",1456444800,,436,4.826666666666667

7052910,2,B00UMDF6J0,"I love the Luther series but, I was disappointed with this season. Honestly, it was quite boring! I found myself dozing off the first half of the second episode. Also, I hate the way they tried to cram all this into two episodes. Idris, has been eluding to a Luther movie. So, I believe the two episodes were to prep audiences for two hour movie format. Seems like a very smart idea, only they didn't make characters interesting enough. They just wanted to give you a taste of Luther with a Jason Bourne vibe. So, they gave us this flimsy plot surrounded around the possible death of a series fave Alice. It could've been much better, hoping they work the kinks out before making a movie.",1455840000,,688,4.468253968253968

Not being able to access closed captioning through Amazon Prime as opposed to Netflix didn't help, since characters in these British shows often tend to swallow their words and otherwise make what they are saying hard to follow.

7053126,3,B00UMDF6J0,"I think that it degenerated into a too violent show, for violence's sake. What was the body count of the last serial killer, 100 (joking, but it felt like it), and he killed all in gruesome ways, and how is it possible that someone would be able to do it, one after the other, and no one could stop him...And I have to say, with so much violence and destruction around them, Londoners are surely a trusty bunch...that's why the serial killers are so successful, I guess. In fiction, don't know how it is in reality. And the plot development with the young woman who spied on Luther and Alice for the longest time, just so that she'd find a way to make him keep his promise made to her when she was 10, that's a little much. I mean, she was so terrified of that girl, that she went to extremes, but she wasn't terrified of Alice? Stretches the verisimilitude. And I am not sure I like Alice dead...didn't like her much in the beginning, but she grew on me, and she was a welcomed diversion.
All in all, I hope they do better in future. Any word on the next episodes?",1454544000,,1065,4.251231527093596

7053233,3,B00UMDF6J0,"Idris Elba is back as Luther. I have read some of the other reviews here and I can understand why the reviewers are in conflict over this season. The first and biggest issue is why is this so short? This is a complex character who handles complex cases. Plus he just lost one of his police partners in the line of duty and that loss needs more coverage than it gets. Secondly there is the issue of Alice, the very bright yet very disturbed young woman who has been both friend and foe to Luther. It seems that Alice is dead. Or is she? This too needed more exploration than it was given. After two hours of viewing, I frankly have no idea if Alice is still living or not. That portion of the show left me utterly confused. If there is a fifth season, I think it could go either way as to Alice.

There is a big new case they are working on which comes in on top of the certain death of the former police partner and uncertain death of Alice. This killer is a rampaging psycho who revels in leaving the bloodiest, most awful crime scenes. He's rapidly escalating too so his killings are becoming more frequent and more lurid. This is interesting but, of course, it is sharing screen time with these other issues so we go in and out of it for only two hours of total coverage. The killer has a strange medical condition which also left me confused because it too was given such short shrift in explanation.

Why did the creators cram so much into so little time? It's as if they took 4 hours worth of material and stuffed it into two hours worth of episodes?

I actually do have an answer to this question. Idris Elba has been forging a movie career. This is what most actors do on the heels of a successful tv series. However, if the movie career stalls and they've let the tv show go, there is nothing to fall back on as one's career. When the fate of this show became iffy, due to Elba's movie run, the other actors on it began looking for other jobs. They are probably already on other series and cannot get away from those shows to shoot this show. This would be the both Alice and the dead former police partner. Anyone else being killed off or otherwise disposed of in the show probably has also moved on with the BBC.

So Elba had to shoot this inbetween his movie roles and they had to shoot it with whomever else was available from the former cast and just fill up the open slots as best they could with new characters. This is a tall order for a two episode run to fulfill.

I think Elba needed to make some big decisions and instead tried to do a big compromise with these two episodes instead. His conflict was whether to continue to nurture his hit tv series or instead give his all to a possible movie career. Season 4 was the compromise solution.

I'm not going to say don't see it. It still was an interesting show. But it is a shadow of what it once was.",1454112000,16,2870,4.228102189781022

7053248,5,B00UMDF6J0,"Well written, acted, multi-layers of plot around the very complex John Luther and a great cast of supporting players.  I've seen many police and himicide shows, I might say BBC's Sherlock Holmes is comparable in quality.  Idris Elba beautifully portrays a flawed hero, caught between his absolute need to save victims from monsters, his necessary empathy with the killers which he used to catch them, and the slippery slope of lawful procedure, politics and life messes.  This man doesn't use a gun and he befriends and eventually falls in love with the first murder suspect of the series, Alice Grey.  All of the characters are drawn with shades of grey-a human mix of good and bad that makes the line between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" less than crisp.  I couldn't help rooting for Luther, hoping he would control his temper and stop letting his driven need to catch killers keep putting him on the verge of legal and personal destruction.  His enemies are cops and killers, his friends are cops and killers.  You just can't get much better than this in a detective series.  I really hope there is more to come.",1453939200,2,1113,4.730569948186528

Still, we got to see Our Man in London in action, and he beat up a few very deserving people to boot.  Both the plotting and setting were good, though the basic story line was a bit macabre.  The dialog could have been a bit better, but then, we Yanks have difficulty more than a few British accents and slang; however, I've got no real complaints on this end.

7053396,5,B00UMDF6J0,Not as good as the 3 previous season but if you are a Luther fan it is worth watching.  Apparently this is the final season.,1451865600,,124,3.96

7053428,2,B00UMDF6J0,"What was even the point? You're fine and all Idris, but you/the team will still need to come a little better than that. Please get a better writer. All creativity has truly escaped this season. It was dense, had as many holes as swiss cheese, some parts were drawn out (It put me to sleep), other parts were rushed, and the overall dialogue and lack of character development missed the mark on many levels. This season has not left the audience wondering ""what will be next?"" Instead, it's caused us to simply put closure to this show in its entirety. BUT, maybe this conclusion is what's answered my original question being, ""what was even the point?"" Point being, the creator's have found a way to no longer entice their audience, yet instead, to place closure on the show as a whole. Very sad for those of us really anticipating this season's premiere.",1451692800,,855,4.631578947368421
7053429,2,B00UMDF6J0,Disappointed. They could have went down many roads in this season- but the one they chose is completely confusing and frustrating. Would have rather stuck with season three and imagined what happened afterwards.,1451606400,,211,5.424242424242424
7053430,2,B00UMDF6J0,Really!!! This is season 4? Two episodes and no Alice. Very weak with no character development and kind of confusing with so much crammed into 2hours. I'm thinking there's got to be more but won't be disappointed if there is not.,1451520000,7,229,4.609756097560975

7053432,5,B00UMDF6J0,Pure awesomeness. This season is super good. I love looking at Idris too.,1451260800,,73,4.6923076923076925

7053434,5,B00UMDF6J0,This is an absolutely intriguing show from start to finish! I was fortunate to see all episodes and the show got better and better with each one. You never know what's coming with each scene. I couldn't look away!  And the cast? Phenomenal. Idris Elba was at his best and so were his co stars. I wish there were more episodes. This show is definitely a gem and should have gone on for at least 10 more seasons.,1451001600,,410,4.256410256410256

7053499,5,B00UMDF6J0,"Idris is riveting as always.  This time Luther's multi-tasking a serial murder, a cold case, a personal loss, and a price on his head.  Wish others had waited to see the second episode before wailing that it wasn't there.",1450828800,,221,4.641025641025641

7053501,1,B00UMDF6J0,"Idris is as always great, as are the rest of the cast. But the story line is WAY too compressed into two 1 hour episodes. It seemed to us that either the primary serial killer story line or the other about Alice should have been deleted OR a 4 to 6 part/series format (that would be our choice) would have been a better vehicle to present both threads. On the whole we were quite disappointed and hope there are no more 2 episode series in the future. We recommend skipping this season for those others like us that love the previous seasons.",1450742400,2,542,4.323529411764706

I turned on my Fire TV and was unable to find episode 2.  I called the Amazon help desk  - but they were less than helpful. They essentially said that in spite of physical evidence to the contrary (shows available on my ipad), and the email proclaiming availability, if was not on the Fire TV screen, it was not available. Good bye and good luck.",1450656000,4,504,4.408602150537634
7053503,1,B00UMDF6J0,"There seems to be a mix up about Luther 4. Rather than show it on tv for three nights, it was shown on BBC America in one evening, lasting about 3 hours. The Luther 4 offered on Amazon is only the 1st hour. Other than buying the DVD, I don't know how to see the rest of the program.",1450656000,10,282,3.7966101694915255
7053504,1,B00UMDF6J0,Where is the second half of the episode??!!!,1450656000,4,44,4.625
7053505,2,B00UMDF6J0,"This review is about the DVD.  At the time I wrote this, Amazon was not offering two episodes streaming.

I love Luther, but found season 4 to be hurried, and not well thought out.

What has made Luther a must watch series before season 4, was the imaginative simultaneous plots and subplots. The multiple strings running at once.  Luther's ability to solve some of the worse crimes is legendary.  However,  Luther is a deeply flawed man. A man insecure in love and marriage, prone to violating the law in order to uphold the law, and as a DCI, can at best be described as ""Dodgy"" using the British vernacular. Luther, without a badge, would be criminal. It's become pretty common for flawed, borderline coppers to grace our screens, think The Shield, for one.  While Luther hasn't killed another cop, he's done things just short of that heinous act. As a copper, he lives his life under a cloud of suspicion, and as he'll say in season 4, ""you may have heard some things about me which may or not be true.  They are.""  Or words to that effect.  Idris does a masterful job bringing Luther to life.  After having read the creator's attempt at a novel, one of the few books I've not been able to finish, I have a deeper respect for Idris' ability to make Luther interesting.

Luther's personal life is always in a shamble of some sort, with a problem that could result in his death or at a minimum, prison.  However, he's able to compartmentalize whatever his problems are in each season, while figuring out the bad guy.  For at some weird level, Luther is able to see things in the minds of the bad guy that others can't.  Think Wire In The Blood, but with an aggressive street person rather than a somewhat timid academian. This doesn't mean whatever the personal problem of the season Luther doesn't get in the way, putting our anti-hero at great risk.  No, those personal problems do get in the way, and Luther usually needs to make a decision, his safety, the safety of others, or getting the bad guy.

I'm not one to ruin plot lines to demonstrate my writing ability.  So I won't do it here. There will be plenty of reviews that will do that for you if you wish.  What I will do is recommend you watch seasons 1-3 then ask yourself, did I enjoy those.  If the answer is yes, and there is no season 5, you can pass on season 4 and be happy in the knowledge that season 3 was without a doubt, the best Luther you'll see. Then you can imagine your own ending for Luther.  For no matter what you imagine, it will be heads above what the writers put together for you in season 4.",1450569600,8,2578,4.3852631578947365
7053506,5,B00UMDF6J0,I cannot speak highly enough about this show! If you've watched it in the past and wonder if it's still as great as 1-3 were....it really is (can only speak for the first hour--where's the rest??!) I truly love Idris Elba...what a great actor!!!!  For the record....I cant believe that anyone that watches this could ever think he's not fit to play Bond. Pure perfection!!!,1450396800,46,373,4.7384615384615385
7053507,5,B00UMDF6J0,"He's back and with a vengeance. Detective John Luther is still a very troubled man and brilliant investigator.

The opening of episode one is a brilliant tease of a truly horrific murderer with no John Luther in sight. But when we do see Luther again, he is living in a remote, isolated, almost desolate, location on the edge of the sea. Luther is on the edge both physically and psychologically. He is a man no longer connected to anyone or anything, and it becomes apparent when one of the police detectives, who is worried about him, asks if there is anyone he can call to stay with him. Luther admits there is no one. The Luther we see now seems to have no fear, and it is frightening.

But this isolation is soon broken when two things, murder and possibly revenge, propel him back into the police world he'd left behind in London. Are some of the things he does questionable? Yes. Is he still a brilliant detective? Yes. Is Alice still in the picture? Who knows.

This looks like it will be another brilliant season and, hopefully, one burning question will be answered in following episodes.",1450396800,20,1098,4.563451776649746
8707411,5,B00UMDF6J0,"What else can one say about Idris Elba - great and fascinating actor - brings depth to this role, as well as all of the other's involved in the series. I must admit that I am also a fan of Alice and like many others hope that the upcoming season 5 will finally show them together again in a happy ending. I am sorry to say that I doubt this happening, but I can hope!
I first saw the actress who played Luther's first wife in a wonderful film called ""Kama Sutra"" by Mira Nair - it is available on Amazon - I saw it  in the theater - it was incredible - stunning movie that completely swept me away and I could actually feel the heat of Indian air.
Back to Luther -  The actress who plays Alice Morgan is also mesmerizing - A+++",1532908800,,727,4.006896551724138

8707414,1,B00UMDF6J0,"Waste of time.  Idris Elba is considered to be this GREAT British actor seen by many on Wired as Stringer.  He basically plays the EXACT same character--a cop (or gangster) who is just SO sexy, every woman (and some men) are hypnotized by him.

Well this is the 4th season of Luther--ANOTHER loner cop who doesnt think that rules apply to him.  The Guardian, one of the BEST factual newspapers in the world, out of London, plus the BBC hated this show.  Unintentionally comical! Bad writing. Ridiculous characters. And plots that are filled with horror and psychopaths.

One show was plenty. Did you ever watch a movie or TV show or read a book thinking This is bad, it just HAS to get better..right??  Then it never does..in fact gets worse.  Ive never seen so many sociopaths and just BAD people in one series.  The violence is WAY over the top. Horrific violence seems to be the plot. Theres no thinking, no plots that hold up.  A mash up of horrible people...the only decent people get killed badly.  A guy wields a shotgun which blows a guys chest and back wide open, but when Luther is struck in the leg by the SAME GUN--he basically just walks it off and continues to go after the bad guy--well they are ALL bad, just pick one!

Im a trauma doc and thought it was too much!  I thought that 12 gauge shotgun had LARGE pellet shells and it would have fractured his femur (thigh bone) into splinters and shredded the arteries and veins of his leg and knee--obliterating the ligaments and tendons...probable amputation-and he walks away? He would have bled out in minutes!",1525564800,,1575,4.562277580071174

1) You enjoy well thought out stories and complex villains
2) You like great acting
3) You like amazing characters
4) You are into antihero protagonists (way more interesting characters)
5) English accents make you happy.",1522195200,,408,4.5
