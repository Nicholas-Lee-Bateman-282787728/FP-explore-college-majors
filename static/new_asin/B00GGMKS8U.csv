6075369,5,B00GGMKS8U,It was just as I rembered it from my childhood. A very good family friendly show. I really enjoyed it.,1390780800,,102,4.15
6075370,5,B00GGMKS8U,"I bought this after buying the earlier 'Golden Orbit' DVD. Again, I wasn't disappointed. Good quality video and audio. Since the series hasn't been released in it entirety yet, it's worth having both of these DVDs just to relive these good two-part episodes... though it does become expensive. Surely the whole series can be released at a reasonable price?",1388448000,11,356,5.0508474576271185
6075371,5,B00GGMKS8U,"Hard Water is a good two part adventure, which aired as the first two episodes of Salvage-1's second season. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it again after not seeing it for thirty plus years. The picture and sound quality are very good. Hopefully, Sony will release the rest of the series soon.",1386806400,15,293,4.764705882352941

8622844,4,B00GGMKS8U,"My only problem is that more episodes are not available!  A good quality Burned, not Pressed DVD of a fun, quirky old TV show.  So many shows that were good ""back in the day"" just don't hold up now. i.e. Greatest American Hero, I loved it then, but it is almost un-watchable now.  Not a fault of the show, times just change.  Salvage 1 does hold up in my opinion.  It's still 70's cheese, but I still enjoyed both the concept and the show.  Maybe it's because the concept has become fact: Private companies now do build and operate rockets, and do indeed go to space.  Whatever the case, I would love it if more episodes were made available.",1464220800,,641,4.336134453781512

8622846,5,B00GGMKS8U,"Good wholesome family entertainment.  Andy Griffith is a garbage man with good old-fashioned American ""can do"" attitude.  He builds a space ship out of a cement truck mixer and salvages space junk.

In this episode, the crew has to tow a iceberg to safety.",1441065600,4,256,4.7727272727272725
