7498443,2,B017AL1VO0,"REALLY cheesy movies.  The worst was ""Pretend You Don't See Her.""  It was almost unwatchable.  I didn't think ""Before I Say Goodbye"" was too bad.  At least the DVDs were cheap.",1501027200,2,176,4.580645161290323
7498444,1,B017AL1VO0,"Money was spent on this production.  This is not a cheap project.  The money was misspent due to bad screen adaptation, i.e., really bad writing and bad acting.  Two of the movies do not ever list a screen writer.  Very rare.  Think very bad daytime soap opera.  As I viewed the disk, I was  amazed..  It is surprisingly inept.",1500163200,3,327,4.423728813559322

7498453,1,B017AL1VO0,"Mary Higgins Clark is a wonderful writer, and weaves interesting plots, with many cliffhanger twists and endings. Do not expect to see any of that here. Frankly, I couldn't even get through some of these movies, although I had waited to receive  them with some anticipation; the only anticipation I found, however, was waiting for a speedy end to watching them.
I am writing this because after having read other reviews here, I chose to give this a shot; I wasn't expecting a lot, just something pleasant to remind me of the three books I had read; I was hoping to enjoy  a couple of others I wasn't familiar with..
The acting was abysmal, and even Jill Clayburgh, who has been known to give good performances, could not save the lousy script or the terrible directing. I got confused as to the plots, even though I had read the books they came from !  The only thing I think these are good for is for film students to see what not to do in a movie; for the rest of us, if it's possible, I would be to return them; no one deserves to get these as a present !",1485993600,5,1058,4.28
