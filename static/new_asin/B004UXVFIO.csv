4473812,5,B004UXVFIO,"David Simon's ""Treme"" is simply the best dramatic series currently on TV. Period. The second season continues the story of New Orleans with its mosaic of characters from musicians, chefs, chiefs and carpetbaggers looking to make a quick buck from the Big Easy's misfortunes caused by Katrina. If you require loads of explosions, buckets of blood and a car chase ever five minutes this well written program is Not for you. ""Treme"" is like a great American novel with its many characters and layers that gives the viewer a Dickensian look at one of America's greatest cities, New Orleans. While there is plenty of drama (The Danziger Bridge killings, street crime and City Hall backroom deals) it is the music and the musicians that are consistently the focus in this outstanding series.",1333584000,28,785,4.954545454545454
4473813,2,B004UXVFIO,"A wag at the New York Observer called Treme a ""charity case"" and I can't agree more. Between this pathetic excuse for a television show, junk like John From Cincinatti, and now Luck, HBO is waning fast. Looking for real entertainment on premium cable? Try Starz' Spartacus: Vengeance. Excitement, adventure, violence and sex--but most importantly, entertainment. FYI: Throne of Kings looks cheap and shoddy compared to Spartacus, and that's all you need to know about the Hobo Network.",1332892800,3,485,5.230769230769231
4473814,4,B004UXVFIO,"""We got magic, good and bad
 Make you happy or make you real sad
 Get everything you want, lose what you had
 Down here in New Orleans""
Dr John

'Treme' HBO's magnificent season one, introduced us to the New Orleans of post-Katrina, the music, the people, the problems, the lives of the everyday people trying to make it work. In Treme's second season we see and really feel how the natives live and die.

'Treme' season two moves to the lives of the musicians, the businesses trying to thrive and into the police stations and politicians pockets. The regulars like Antoine Batiste, played by Wendell Pierce, find themselves trying to rebuild their lives. In his case, he is a trombonist and works in the local school band by day and in the clubs by night. Terry Colson, played by David Morse, is a detective in the police department, where he feels out the greed and graft of his colleagues. Melissa Leo, plays Toni, the local lawyer who fights for her clients and now finds herself trying to help her daughter, Sofia. Sofia, played by India Ennenga, who is reacting to a tragic loss, has become the teenager with rebellion andresentment. Chef Janette, played by Kim Dickens has moved to New York City to try and ply her wares in the big time. Professional trumpeter Delmond, played by Rob Brown also moved to NYC to find his profession.

'Treme' season two looks at the day-to-day journey of its people. A lot going on in the second season. In every episode there are surprising finds.  I became involved in the characters lives, and their struggles. Ladonna, played by Khandi Alexander, has a personal tragedy that leads to more grief. There is so much personal grief and trauma that all of the crinme in New Orleans takes its toll.  We look at the spirit of the people of New Orleans and in particular, the people we follow. Anthony Bourdain contributes to the food scene. New romances abound, crime increases, the musicians become more authentic. Jon Seda, who plays Nelson Hildago, gives us a glimpse of the FEMA corruption that we have heard about all throughout the aftermath of Katrina. Such wonderful character development by the superb writing team of David Simon and Eric Overmyer. Treme may become as important and as wonderful as my all time favorite series, 'The Wire'. Treme gives us a wonderful drama, a snapshot of a city, and its people, all changing with the seasons.

Highly Recommended.  prisrob 07-16-11

4474726,4,B004UXVFIO,"Although the music (jazz, funk, New Orleans second line, folk, hip hop) remains the real star of this drama, the ensemble cast and intelligent scripting stitch together diverse story lines nicely.  The stories touch upon municipal and police corruption, racism, grieving the loss of family and friends, addiction, bruised musical egos, FEMA failures, sexual violence, striving for success, and above all the importance of authentic roots and loyalty in North America's most unique city whose residents are trying to recover from Hurricane Katrina more or less on their own, with little apparent outside help.

I will be watching Seasons 3 and 4 to see if they can keep it going at such a high level. Kudos to the show's writers & artists for keeping it real.",1457568000,,758,5.007936507936508

But it's also about interesting character development - people responding to what happened in a variety of different ways in a host of different circumstances.  The passion for the unique cultures in New Orleans that come together in this amazing town is expressed beautifully.  Put this with authentic musicians and mind-blowing music of different genres in real New Orleans clubs.  No movie sets here.  It's the real deal and  it has it all.",1455580800,,616,4.922330097087379

4474873,4,B004UXVFIO,"I was a bit worried after the first episode.  The restaurant scenes moved to NYC and were completely out of synch with the NOLA setting. The dialogue was like a NY inside joke and since the foodie scene there is insular and meaningless to those of us outside of the city, I was worried.  However, things picked up and the focus shifted back more to NOLA and the characters began to grow again rather than become self-indulgent New Yorkers wanting their next over-priced dish.",1454198400,,475,4.642857142857143

4475209,5,B004UXVFIO,"On par with ""The Wire."" Excellent storytelling alongside historic events that took place following the constructed disaster of flooding after hurricane Katrina. More than the role Baltimore plays in ""The Wire,"" New Orleans and its manifold gifts to the culture of America functions in a central role in the series.

4475430,5,B004UXVFIO,"Been binging on this one.
 Been binging on all of them to excess.
Its got a real feel to it Ive never been to New Orleans, I do know what Katrina did to the place and I know that there were people in the lower nine. I know it was a pretty good wreck. I can make good guesses as to what it was like to be there and I can make good guesses as to what it was like to start all over.
A tip of my hat to the people, a tip of my hat to the music, and a tip of hat to some real strong character performance.
And a tip of my hat to those lucky people who get to write the screen play for this thing. You stumbled into some really good s*** to write about.
Its a veritable cultural soup. Its like every race of people in the world either washed up on the beach or floated down the Mississippi and wound up in New Orleans with the express purpose of amusing me.
Love all those giggle footed musicians and I love the music. I never was a jazz fan, but when you put the faces behind the horns and pianos, the banjos and the guitars, those bull fiddles and the sousaphones, mix them all together in one big room you get a pretty hearty broth. They call them gigs.
I suppose it has it flaws, most things do, but Im blind to em either willfully or otherwise.",1438819200,,1243,3.893700787401575

The accents are correct and they use lots of locals that I recognize.  Most movies, etc.  have their actors use a long southern drawl when playing New Orleanians which is about as far off as you can get.  There is something called a ""Y'at"" accent which comes from locals ""axing""  ""Where Y'at?"".  The term means ""How are you?"" Other Y'atisms include ""You been by your mom 'n ems?"" (You don't go ""to"" anywhere, you go ""by"").  They don't buy groceries, they ""make"" them.  The sidewalk is the ""banquet"" and many people in Treme may have been heard to ask ""Do da bus roll by heya?""  There is nothing quite like New Orleans - rich with culture, colloquialisms, corruption and carnival tradition!",1438560000,,856,4.458064516129032

THREME, is a HBO series with all seasons available on AMAZON PRIME for free.  You can't beat that.  And if you are reading this review you probably watch the wonderful first season.  Keep going.  The second season is much darker, but with more music, more to lkearn about New Orleans.

4475800,5,B004UXVFIO,"The entire Treme series is very well done.
I have enjoyed each episode and  the attention to detail that the show presents.
The characters are well-rounded and engaging.  It's as though they are people I'd like to know except for the character portrayed by Sam Robards.
I could tell from the beginning that he was taking advantage of Janette's character.
It's sad to me that the series could not continue.
I'd like to add that I was equally impressed with The Wire series as well.  Again, I wish that it could continue also!",1429920000,,524,4.612903225806452

4475951,5,B004UXVFIO,what an amazing series and the story it tells.  i have no doubt that government abstructured blockage of the repair of New Orleans can not be denied after watching this series.  New Orleans was left to fend for itself after bush the DOLT confirmed how good a job Brown was doing.  on a humorous note two scenes from this season cracked me up. One was the old Indian Chief telling Ron Carter how to play a bass line.  the other was the Chef ending up in bed with her assistant chef.  yeah i laughed bunches.  i was not at all ready to see the character being played by Steve Erle to be killed .  i thought he was along for the ride of all 3 seasons.  and Kandi Alexander  oooh my what a cutie she is.  and she tackles her role so well.  all the actors do a great job but she stands out.,1426118400,,785,4.032467532467533

4476180,5,B004UXVFIO,The series does a thorough job of personalizing the effects that a natural disaster can have on a community.  Appearances by popular and less known  musicians are a bonus to look forward too.  It makes sense that this series would not go on for long but it doesn't make it any easier to detach from great characters when the series ends.  I will probably purchase the series and rewatch.,1419811200,,387,4.565217391304348

Skillful acting and writing and great music draw you into caring what happens to these people. Worth watching.

4476374,4,B004UXVFIO,I'm stuck on this show. Season 2 isn't grabbing me like season one. I don't care for the sleazy cousin from Houston and the bar raped bar owner saga goes on too long.

4476375,5,B004UXVFIO,"The music alone is worth the price of admission. Add the scenes shot in New Orleans, plus fine writing and acting, this show is a delight. The traditions, language and music of New Orleans are natural backdrops in this gritty drama that follows the lives of lawyers, rebuilders, Indians (New Orleans Indians are different from any other Indians-check it out) teachers, bar owners and musicians-Oh the musicians.  Many of the scenes are set in music venues, where nationally and locally known musicians are either part of the action or part of the background. Impressarios (Elvis Costello, Allen Toussaint, Steve Earle-3 Grammy's, Best Contemporary Folk Album of 2010, Kermit Ruffins, a Neville brother or two, the incomparable Lucia Miccareli and many others too numerous to list-really 10-12 music stars per episode) stop by for extended cameos or, in Miccareli's case have a major role-speaking and playing-in most episodes.

4476406,5,B004UXVFIO,"Wonderful show about the aftermath of the Treme neighborhood and its people and culture in New Orleans during the aftermath of Hurricaon Katrina. The characters are complex and real, giving what I think is a window into some of the experiences and issues real people came up against while trying to rebuild the city and their lives physically and emotionally after the flood. I certainly thought I knew more about New Orleans than I did, watching this opened my eyes quite a bit to the ways the media and government lacked certain accountability and through the eyes of these characters I can better relate to the struggle after the flood that was almost as taxing for some as the flood itself. There is violence and some pretty explicit sex, so maybe not age appropriate for the tots. I feel sad about that though, because I think it would benefit younger generations that may not remember so well the devastation that hurricane left on this city. On the other hand, there was/is real violence of all sorts, physical, sexual, that people faced, so it adds a layer of authenticity that is valuable. I would recommend this show to a friend without at doubt!",1411776000,,1156,4.727722772277228

The acting is superb, the music incredible, and the writing ties it all together so well. An excellent way to ""teach"" people what happens in a disaster, how the effects just keep on rolling, and better, how there are so many con artists and scammers, people who take advantage of the situation on all levels.

Amid the corruption of the police department, the lack of help from the government, delaying funds to help minorities rebuild and return to their homes, deliberately tearing down properties that could have been saved in minority communities, the people still were able to survive and make a diligent effort to preserve their culture. Through it all, it shows that regardless of the circumstances, there is no place like home.",1409788800,,555,4.8936170212765955

Treme is certainly on the top shelf of modern storytelling on TV.  It's a series that sucks you in and won't let you go.  The characters, the story, the emotion and real life are as good as any of them.  Throw in the incredible music, guest stars and cameos, and it really is one of the best shows on television, which is not surprising considering the track record of the producers.  I can't believe it's taken me this long to get around to watching it, but Amazon Prime made it possible!",1406505600,,664,4.491666666666666

4476631,4,B004UXVFIO,"I enjoyed watching Treme.  I'm actually upset with myself that I didn't watch it when it was new on HBO.  Enjoyable story lines.  It sometimes gets a bit tough to remember who is in which part of the story, but I suspect that's more on me than on the production.  The large cast is truly great.  Khandi Alexander, Wendell Pierce, Melissa Leo, David Morse and Kim Dickens are wonderful, as always.  Steve Zahn plays a role that is tailor made for him.  Clarke Peters and Rob Brown playing father and son respectively bring a realistic dynamic to their roles.

For me, another attraction to the series is the music.  I always knew that New Orleans was a vibrant music city, but Treme has introduced me to a number of great musicians, Kermit Ruffins, John Boute and Trombone Shorty, to name a few.  It reintroduced me to the Neville Brothers and Dr. John.

All in all, this is a great, great series.  I'm glad that I finally caught up with it.  And I look forward to watching the remainder of the series.",1406246400,,1001,4.464088397790055

I'm from the Delta and I have family in Louisiana and Southern Mississippi who were affected by Katrina. All reasons why I'd expect to love this show but I find myself repeatedly drifting off and doing other things while the show is on. I just can't seem to get involved in the story lines. The only two I find compelling are those of Albert Lambreaux and  Ladonna Batiste-Williams.

4476747,5,B004UXVFIO,"This is a truly great show. I was hooked with the first season and by the end of the second season I am cursing HBO for only having 3 and 1/2 seasons (season 4 is only 5 episodes). By this season I am fully engaged in the stories of each cast member and how they came to be at the point they are at in any given time. I like that their is no main character that the show puts too much emphasis on - they are all equally important. I like that each episode explores what is going on in each of their lives, moving from first one then another, until they revolve back and pick up again. It makes the show interesting in that you actually have to think to keep up and are not blindly watching. I miss John Goodman's character, but the exploration of the wife and daughter's grief and how they do and don't handle it is well done - very real. The exploration of the NOPD's corruption, the additional corruption of council members and serving politicians and how they all literally took the food out of the mouths of the people they swore to serve has been borne out through trials and testimony and is very well portrayed here. But, what struck me was that by the end of season 4 you acknowledge that corruption is as much a part of the culture as the incredible jazz they love and play with such heart and soul.  I am watching the entire show for the 2nd time and have already picked up a number of things I missed in the first go round.

citizens trying to get their lives back, their culture. The frustration of

4476789,5,B004UXVFIO,"The second season of Treme is a notable change in tone from the first. While still not a police procedural by any means, it begins to cover the topic of crime in several ways, deviously woven into the day-in-the-life stories the show has established. The show also expands its landscape, spending a day with the Cajuns and their Mardis Gras well away from the city, following a character's relocation to New York, and introducing new characters. Somehow, Vietnamese shrimpers are introduced into the show.

The crime is white-collar as well, and a devious real estate developer and a crooked political element are introduced. I was utterly shocked to learn that one politician character is played by the real person on whom he is based.

Other highlights include a character starting his own band, and a new emphasis on music students in public middle schools. The latter are not covered in the same depth as schools in The Wire, but provide a deeper sense of reality and community to the show as a whole.

Really, though, I don't have to sell it. If you've watched the first season through, you'll not likely get off at this point.",1393891200,,1132,4.76530612244898

4476877,5,B004UXVFIO,"Read the reviews. How many of them say 'this is the best television show I've ever seen?""  That's because it is...you need to watch this.

For the music
For the very real characters
For the never-flagging story lines
For the food...which makes those food porn cooking shows look like TV dinners
...and most of all for a place that is uniquely our own but not ours.

I should say I am not a television fan. I have not seen a single episode of Friends or Glee or Dancing with the Stars or Twilight.  TV is the great wasteland.  Treme is the rare exception.  Treme is beautiful. The characters will break your heart and fix it and break it again. It is the only television show I have ever watched where I laugh and I cry and share the emotions. There is humor and wit as well. The acting is first class, the writing simply the best. It never gets soapy or soppy, it's hip and sarcastic, but depicts very honest emotions. The characters are unique, and they're real...no one note villains or heroes. People are good and bad, sometimes at the same time. The one semi-villain is so charming, it's hard not to like him while not liking him...the way it is with most con artists and grifters and schemers.  The story lines never take the easy way out either.

And then there's New Orleans and the music and all the things hat makes it special.  It's impossible not to watch a funeral sequence without wanting to strut.  Listening to Howling Wolf without waving your arms over your head? Impossible.  This is such an involving show, it makes you want to get off that couch and dance! Or grin. Or cry. Or party. Or eat, fight, make love, make music, cook, something. You don't just watch Treme,you experience it.  It's a magical show in a magical setting.

New Orleans is not America but it is something you'd find only in America, a place that's real and human, beautiful, dirty and gritty, loud, steeped in tradition and unlike any other place on the planet. There is a move afoot to gentrify the place, turn it into some cleancut Disnleyland with To Go cups and mardi gras beads. If we let that happen, we lose that which cannot ever be replaced. If you don't love New Orleans already, watch this show so you will, and so you won't allow the Powers To Be to destroy what's left of her.

I want to say so much about this show, how moving it is, how unforgettable the music is...but you just have to watch it and hear it to understand.

Five stars...easy. And only because there is no way to award ten.",1367193600,4,2494,4.414847161572053

4476907,5,B004UXVFIO,"Treme deals with the recovery of New Orleans after Katrina, and the first season did an excellent job of that...It almost sound trite to say it, but there is no other place in the US like New Orleans...Others are close...San Francisco, New York, Key West...But New Orleans is a combination of music, food and the Mississippi River...It still has ""zoned pleasure"" and fully recognized corruption and people there have an appreciation of life felt directly on their taste buds, ears, eyes, nose and nether regions..It IS the most sensual city in the United States...and overnight,  parts of the city was damned near destroyed, and within 2 weeks a diaspora of its people took place that scattered them all over the US... With ruin, and basic services running hit or miss or not at all, old institutions gone,government ineptness, and shell shock, recovery began with one step forward and two steps back. Some of its citizens will never get back and those that did are finding a new place with much of the old gone.....some just couldn't deal with it. The first season captured that pretty well...
  The second season throws a wider net and a more detailed look at some of the components...The Police Department had its bad types but it had (and has) its heroes as well...People fought back against crime but there was a lot of it...Many parts of the city were underpopulated and it was under patrolled...others lived under a near martial law status..There was an influx of people from out of state who saw the disaster as an opportunity, and they capitalized on it...On the other hand, blue tarps were being replaced by roofs, there were instruments being put back in the hands of musicians who lost theirs and  some businesses and services started coming back on line....and some of the people started coming back.
  Many don't understand the premise of the series and probably aren't watching Treme...A city that puts Mardi Gras and rebuilding the dome high on their priority list for recovery is completely alien thought to them....But the Saints and Mardi Gras are two huge economic engines for New Orleans...New Orleans cried louder than the neighboring state of Mississippi, but they felt like they lost more...They lost their homes and a way of life that was anchored in the old and familiar, and one that could not be duplicated anywhere else. The second season illustrates that...
  I love seeing musicians who are very well known in New Orleans but not known that well nationally...The main characters are well picked...Subjects such as the Mardi Gras Indians, Mardi Gras in Eunice, Working through when all records are lost and the frustration over losing the familiar are well done considering the limited  format...Recovery after a cataclysm is heroic stuff, but it also usually involves a lot of pain and frustration, misdirection and wrong choices, letting go of some things and holding tight to others...Treme does a good job with all of that....New Orleans is more than a walk down Bourbon Street and a hurricane drink.",1362441600,,3034,4.944990176817289

I watch as much as I can through streaming media, but it's best to get the DVD or Blu-Ray for this, because there are special features that you can activate for during the show or to browse after. In a review in The New Yorker, Emily Nussbaum said, ""If you find jazz snobs annoying, or foodies annoying, or quietly dignified people who go 'mmm-hmm' annoying, there will be parts of Treme that you'll find annoying.""

4476958,5,B004UXVFIO,"After finishing season two, my review of season one still applies:

I hate to focus the work of hundreds down to a single auteur, but David Simon has now put together an impressive oeuvre of modern American realism. 'The Wire' was, of course, one of television's singular achievements, and in my opinion 'Generation Kill' was equally triumphant. I must admit I was worried, even disappointed, when I heard that Simon's next project would star Wendell Pierce as a jazz musician in New Orleans. The potential seemed there for mere boosterism. And indeed, 'Treme' is largely a paean to the crescent city. The city is not a character, but many characters - from the gritty Treme, to the glossy Quarter, to genteel Uptown. But like all of Simon's work, Treme's real strength is in its cast of characters, played by fantastic actors who are given the freedom to bring the city to life. This show is an ensemble drama - unlike 'The Wire', there is no overarching plot tying it all together. There are just the stories of ordinary people, and of course the sounds of great music.

Season two (slowly) increases the focus on institutional corruption (politicians, capitalist developers, police, feds), and the contrast between an authentic New Orleans and a highly commodified New York.",1350259200,,1277,4.934883720930233

4477001,5,B004UXVFIO,"I just wanted to give it 5 stars. This series is about real people, not superheroes; they're flawed, they make mistakes, they don't have all the answers; but their resilience, the way they preserve their humanity no matter what challenge they face, their capacity to create beauty or goodness and to recognize it in others, that is more wonderful than the story of Wonderman or Wonderwoman. This is not about one guy saving the world from evil,  but about many people slowly, at times almost invisibly, nurturing their city back into life; there is no attempt at hiding the ugliness, the corruption, the pain or the violence, but there is also joy, hope, friendship, love, respect, not to mention humor and Music, music, music, such music as surely makes the angels weep tears of joy.",1349395200,,784,4.807407407407408

4477005,5,B004UXVFIO,"Even more enthralling than season one.  The characters from season one grow and develop in many ways - and some new characters spice it up!  It was hard not to have a Treme' Marathon and watch them all in one night!  I shure could go for some Gumbo!  The deeper commentary on our nation and our society is very important - there are so many layers to all of the stories that are woven into the whole series.  It is really interesting to try to discern the nuances that the different writing and directing collaborations bring to each episode.  I particularly love the culinary aspects of the story line - and find them to be very realistic and true to life - this allows me to infer that the whole story must also have similar truths and be directly and accurately tied to the real New Orleans of today  - unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to return post Katrina.  Seeing the show absolutely makes me want to return though.  Until then - I will watch again, and look forward to season three.",1345939200,,1002,4.4021739130434785
4477006,5,B004UXVFIO,"I truly enjoyed the first season of Treme and I had to purchase the second season. I can hardly wait until the third season begins. There is a fine line between true reality and fictionalized reality. The writers seem to know exactly how to merge them both and give their audience a believeable storyline to hold you captive. The actors and actresses are the greatest with their craft and experiences. If you haven't seen it, please do--you won't be disappointed. I know nothing about the personal lives of the people in New Orleans and I don't know anyone who lives in New Orleasn and I know nothing about the horror and devastation of flood waters and losing your home to the destruction and stresses that it can cause. But I have sympathy and empathy for all.

4477035,5,B004UXVFIO,"As another New Orleanian who struggled through Katrina and its aftermath, I disagree with the reviewer who says this series depicts life in New Orleans as boring! The subject matter is too close to home for me to speak for other parts of the country, but for me, the 2nd season is as gripping as the first. Each episode surprises me with at least one or two scenes that take my breath away or give me goose bumps as I relive an event I had pushed under the surface. A deceptively mundane example is when Toni's colleague says she is leaving the city, about 18 months after Katrina; I had an instant and visceral flashback to the increasing depression I would feel when another family I knew gave up and left after having been back. There are still plenty of reminders of why the city is worth continuing to stay and rebuild, but overall the city at large seemed to be sinking into depression at this point. The Mayor, the police, violent crime, drug overdoses and back-room deals dealing away a whole neighborhood to build a new hospital when repairing the old ones would have been better for everybody except the developers and the politicians - all of these are touched on.

My only real criticism at this point is the supplemental audio commentary. It is supposed to be about the music, but they skip over some important musical scenes and, like Delmond's New York friends, they make inane cliche-ridden comments on the events of the time; they even make mistakes about the plot line. These guys should stick to filling in the facts about the music.",1336262400,13,1552,4.602888086642599

4477037,5,B004UXVFIO,One of my favorite shows of all time.

4477038,2,B004UXVFIO,"As most New Orleanians, I awaited this show with a great deal of anticipation. There are a lot of quality people involved with its production. But the bottom line is this show is boring. There is very little plot development. There is no story. The actors are predictable and play the part of people in New Orleans, but I haven't met any characters as boring or as eccentric as the ones played in Treme. Treme is at its best an outsider's romantic view of New Orleans. At its worst it is pity television, trying to make a case for how tough New Orleans is and how vital the traditions here are. Through it all, it perpetuates the victim mentality that is pervasive in the city. I tried getting through the entire season, but gave up around the eighth episode because it was so extraordinarily boring and plotless.

The only thing that works in the show is the cinematography. It is simply beautiful.",1334102400,8,899,4.549382716049383

Thankfully I had enough sense to continue and to catch on to what it is about.  This was filmed several months after Katrina ravaged the city and it follows several characters as they try to cope with the aftermath.  I gather it is based on all the things that the inhabitants had to deal with.  Sometimes it is hard to watch, seeing first hand what many endured.  There is also much comic entertainment plus great music and musicians, and up to now I never cared that much about this type of music.  It has grown on me.  I ended up ordering seasons 2, 3 and 4 and am currently watching No. 3.  Some brilliant people thought up and did this series IMO.",1497052800,,806,4.215686274509804
