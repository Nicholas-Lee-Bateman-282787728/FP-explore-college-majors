5773629,3,B00D49YEHO,"Watched the first 2 hours last night. We spent the entire 2 hours comparing it to the Selfridge movie of last year. Moray looks very much like Selfridge. The woman who wants to marry Moray & whose father is loaning him the money to expand his store, looks so much like the wife in Selfrige that the people who made Selfridge must wonder if the Paradise people were making a carbon copy movie & for what purpose? Kind of like making the same dress to sell in a shop across the street from a shop that already sells it???  The rest of the 2 hours were spent trying to figure out in what other movies did we see some of the actors, Downtown Abbey, Lark Rise to Candleford & Last Tango in Halifax(on the same night no less).  I have often wondered (no disrespect here as I am a British descendant & love the country)if Britain has more than 29 actors/actresses? As far as the Paradise movie, well, the costumes are nice but the story is so predictable. Maybe after seeing the entire show, I will come back & modify my review. Not trying the bash this movie but it's really too close in substance to Selfridges where ""THE SALE IS OVER"".

UPdate: I just learned that the Paradise was made before Selfridge. Both series are still a ""watch it one time"", ""been there, done that"". So, to who ever made the ""copy"", please don't copy the copy. :)",1381104000,3,1334,4.349397590361446
5773630,5,B00D49YEHO,"To a young Scottish lass in the 1880's, the allure of a big city in Northern England offers shops, suitors, sin and seduction.  At least, that is what is being served up in The Paradise.  Are we ready for one more English period drama in which the costumes star as much as the actors?  Of course we are.  The 1880's are one of the prettiest fashion decades ever with ruffles, folds, pleats, bustles, lace, decollette, and the hour-glass silhouette accompanied by a parasol and a fetching hat. The men are dapper, too.

In this series, country girl Denise Lovett (Joanna Vanderham of WHAT MAISIE KNEW) is hired to work at The Paradise shop by the shop's deeply dimpled, bedroom-eyed owner, Mr. John Moray (Emun Elliott of BLACK WATCH and GAME OF THRONES).  Whispered rumors of the suspicious death of Moray's rich young wife swirl around Lovett.  Although Moray is courting another lady, Katherine Glendenning (Elaine Cassidy of HARPER'S ISLAND) from a gentrified family of wealth, it's clear to us, the audience, that Moray is intensely attracted to our country lass Lovett. And his intentions toward the innocent Lovett may not be honorable. Part of the dramatic tension is that you can't tell if Moray is a total cad, or might be redeemable and protect young Lovett's virtue.

Is Lovett attracted to him?  Possibly, almost certainly, but she confesses she doesn't want to marry him, she wants to BE him. She is creative, spirited and plucky, so she may be a match for his ambition.

Based on the 1883 Emile Zola novel ""Au Bonheur des Dames"" (""The Ladies Paradise""), this production was created and written by Bill Gallagher who produced LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD.  For those of us who can't get enough of these costumed English period dramas, this will probably be a five star bit of fluff, fripperies and frivolity for us.",1381017600,11,1823,4.810897435897436
5773631,5,B00D49YEHO,"Set in an undisclosed location in the north of England during the 1870s, 'The Paradise' is a historically accurate period drama regarding Britain's first department store, and the lives of those people affected by it. From Mr Moray, who struggles to make his visionary enterprise thrive, to the small shopkeepers he has inadvertently put out of business, to the the wealthy Glendennings and humble employees alike. Everyone, including the side characters, are richly drawn and come to life. Especially Denise, who quickly proves adept at her position in lady's wear (much to the chagrin of Miss Audrey, the strict departmental head who Sarah Lancashire plays to such perfection, she steals every scene), and becomes something of a love interest to Moray. The tension there, I might add, is lovely, and plays a role in the last episode's cliffhanger. Thankfully, 'The Paradise' has been recommissioned for a second series.

In addition to the character driven story lines, this made for a nice look at the class divisions in Victorian England, how the worlds of the working class and the nouveau riche differed so enormously, yet in the end were both equally plagued by very human problems. It was a treat to watch simply for the respect paid to the era, and truly, this was a wonderful example of British programming.

In fact, I would go so far as saying this is arguably one of the best BBC productions in recent years, with its lush attention to detail in spite of the more limited budget, the authentic sets, sharp dialogue and impressive costumes. I was beginning to despair that the BBC would ever produce a period drama of such high calibre again, but I am glad to have been proven so wrong in that regard. This is exactly the quality I have come to expect from the BBC in years past, and am delighted to see the return of that class and wit that once defined the majority of British television. Anyone who loves classic Brit drama/romance should find this series an absolute pleasure to watch.",1376870400,162,2001,4.813953488372093
5773652,5,B00D49YEHO,Season 1 is to be treasured as far as the story  goes.  A beginning and end that is quite plausible and there is very  good chemistry between the 2 love interests.  Don't bother getting season 2 dvd because it can't compare to season 1.  Season 2 is a letdown as far as story and characters.,1494288000,,291,4.218181818181818

5773655,4,B00D49YEHO,"This is a solid period piece! It's not as dramatic or heavy as Downton, but its an easy watch with beautiful costumes and settings. Similar to Mr Selfridge, the majority of the plot takes place within a department store and centers around the employees. If you watch a lot of period pieces, you'll see a number of familiar faces in the actors. The plot was just exciting enough to keep me entertained!",1491350400,,401,4.583333333333333

The acting, cinematography, costumes, script, all far exceed Selfridge.  It just blows my mind that the powers that be would cancel  Paradise in order to devote more attention to such an inferior alternative.  Episode 1 of Selfridge, I was immediately turned off by the gratuitous sex scenes (and lots of them) and lack of uprightness and morality running rampant.  And it just went downhill from there.

5773890,4,B00D49YEHO,"The ongoing drama of the lives of a group of people in England late 19th century working in a department store.
  The presentation of the usual variety of characters in a most interesting fashion, and the love story at the center of the floor.
Very, good acting, and great customs, this production truly takes you back in time, and makes you feel like a participant notwithstanding time and space.
  All the character are interestingly defined, so it is difficult not to identify with at least one to be drawn in.

  A simply excellent English production, hard to put down.",1422489600,,573,4.7272727272727275
5773891,3,B00D49YEHO,"Perhaps after the fifth episode my problem with this show will correct itself. First let me say the acting is very good. If you were a fan of the BBC show Larkrise you will be happy to see so many of the actors from there on this show, either as regulars or staring in one episode. I really have just one complaint and it is with the way the lead character, Denise, is written (the actress playing her is very good). In spite of the fact that she is smart and business savvy she acts like a doormat to the two nasty females she works with. Yes, I get that they are jealous of Denise (after all, she is more beautiful, intelligent and quick on her feet than anyone at the store including the owner!). But why would she keep going out of her way to be kinder to these two women than a saint would. Give her some backbone! No one would be THAT kind over and over again just to get knocked down. It is ridiculous that an intelligent woman is also such a chump in every episode I have watched so far.  But I see possibilities with an excellent group of actors so I will watch more episodes and hope she puts them in their proper place. It is great to see such a smart business woman in a historical show but does she have to be so unrealistic about people out to ruin her to the point Denise cuddles up in bed to comfort a girl that just repeatedly said she hated her, or gets the owner to throw a party to cheer up the nasty harpy ,who doesn't like her, only to be told at the end by said harpy once again that she should ""not think"" just do her job. Who in their right mind would continue to be nice to these two? It wouldn't hurt if Denise had some kind of flaw, actually she needs one, but being a saint is not the answer. I really hope this major flaw gets corrected because this show could be wonderful to watch.",1422489600,,1813,4.078431372549019

I had not seen season 2 yet then. I have just watched episodes 1&2 of season 2, and I think I can see why. I can already tell it isn't as good as season one. For one thing they took Pauline's character out. My husband and I both liked her as a main supporting character. Episode 2 of season 2, has a homosexual woman on it. Let's be honest, they didn't talk about that openly in that time period, so why should they add that? Just to push the envelope. Well obviously it failed them this time. Deffinately watch season 1, it has a satisfying enough ending that you don't need season 2. It was better left up to my imagination as to what happened after that.

This show is actually very similar to Selfridges, also, but I won't allow her to watch Selfridges, yet. I feel that The Paradise is a bit tamer and easier for me to share with her, but is also engaging enough to hold her interest (and mine).

I have been dazzled by the brilliant costumes and sets in this show... I didn't think any of the BBC shows could give Downton Abbey any competition in that area, but I think The Paradise has done it well.

Also, the cast is full of very attractive people, even the ""villains"". This kind of surprised me that so many of them are.

I love that they always touch on important issues that are still important to us today, such as women's rights. In that way, this show is very similar to Downton Abbey and other similar BBC shows that have been produced in recent years.",1414454400,,934,4.325714285714286

5774086,5,B00D49YEHO,"An engrossing story that drew me in from the start. There's enough mystery in the characters and their agendas, (hidden and not so hidden)  to keep my interest. You see  behaviors which intrigue, but which aren't clarified until  later. It also highlights the social/political issues of the time, such as married women not being allowed to work outside the home. There's plenty of internal and external conflict. Seeing the high-and-mighty not always getting what they want is very satisfying. The characters, even the minor ones, are  well-developed and stand on their own two feet. David Hayman as the morbidly loyal Mr. Jonas is brilliant. Clara is another favorite. The only difficulty I have is with Moray and his interactions with the women around him. However, he is well-portrayed as both tormented and lonely, so in all fairness he isn't a heartless womanizer. What I like best is what seems to be an underlying warning to those who enjoy manipulation and control: events will unfold as they will, and don't be surprised if you are left empty-handed.",1413676800,2,1059,5.0

5774134,4,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise bears almost no relation to the book - The Ladies' Paradise - from which it purports to have been adapted, and that's a shame. But evaluated on its own merits, The Paradise is enormously entertaining. The twists and turns of the plot, the well-executed period costuming, the snappy dialogue, the subtle and effective acting, the superlative casting: all these make for a TV series of the highest quality. Is it a romance novel on the small screen? Oh, yes. But I don't say that as though it's a bad thing. A guilty pleasure it may be for those of us who esteem nineteenth century literature and wish to see it - rather than some Barbara Cartlandized version - dramatized, but it is still - I admit it - a pleasure. It remains for someone who (a) understands the original; (b) is not afraid of it, to produce a film or television rendition far more true to the book. It will be a darker, more sophisticated, less pinky rose version, but it could be - like the book - a work for the ages. I do have one criticism for the series' costumers: Don't use mass-produced garment and upholstery trims for the ladies' dresses! In particular, I refer to Moray's off-and-on fiancee. A woman of her class and means would never allow her seamstress to use yard goods of the sort we now purchase at chain fabric stores. Do the costumers for the series really think viewers won't recognize the $4.99/yard rosette trim and upholstery edging we buy at Jo Ann's and Hancock's? Mass produced, machine-made trim was certainly available in the era - it is one of the the material culture developments that blurred class lines and gave stores like the Paradise a leg up on the market - but women of class did not employ it any more in 1885 than in 1785.",1410998400,,1742,4.515822784810126

5774137,5,B00D49YEHO,"I suggest writing to Masterpiece and requesting they change their mind about their pulling the US plug on this excellent BBC series. There is no such thing as a mere supporting role in this. Each role is special. Each actor is terrific. We care about each character. Take any one away and the series would lose something. Another poster had suggested it was their lack of promotion that led to lower viewing numbers in the US. I don't know whether that is the problem but the issue is certainly not the top quality of the series. The only negative on The Paradise is that there simply isn't enough of it. Tell them to bring it back  if the original cast is still available. Season 1 is all good.

Much Later: A loss that it was never brought back. Some of the actors/actresses had roles that may never show them off as well. I still rewatch the two seasons, though the first is the best.",1410480000,,887,4.402439024390244

5774139,5,B00D49YEHO,"What an enchanting show! The Paradise is a department store set in the north east of England. The first of its kind. The shopkeepers across the street are very disgruntled as they are slowly being put out of business by the new department store. It is beautiful. Whomever designed and decorated the sets did an amazing job!

The store owner John Moray is quite creepy at first. He has a past and you don't really know if he murdered his dead wife or not to begin with although he is obsessed with her memory. He grew on me as the series progressed. The real star is Denise, a new employee at the Paradise she is bright and as the Victorians would put it has 'ideas way above her station'. She wants so much more out of life than to just be an ordinary shop girl which in those days could get a girl into trouble. I liked her a great deal. I also liked Miss Audrey played by Sara Lancashire, as the strict supervisor of ladies wear. She really does steal the show!

SPOILERS: Moray has an on/off relationship with Katherine Glendenning a well to do young woman who is absolutely obsessed with him. She is spoiled and at times annoying as she is manipulative and used to getting her own way. But then that makes good TV. Lord Glendenning, Katherine's father purchases the entire lease for the street which puts Moray into a situation. Unwillingly he agrees to marry Katherine but he is falling in love with Denise. He tries to break off the engagement to Katherine but she blackmails him telling him he'll lose The Paradise if he does not honor the betrothal.

Wonderful show, great characters, beautiful sets as well as heartwarming stories mixed in with a little darkness for drama. I feel anyone who enjoyed Downton Abby may like this. Can't wait for season 2!",1410220800,,1761,4.5141065830721

I do like ""Mr. Selfridge"" but not so much as I loved ""The Paradise!"" I am very sad this unfortunate decision, to end production, was made.

5774159,3,B00D49YEHO,"It's alright.  Keeps your curiosity peaked for several episodes.  I love the period details of everyday life, and the conflict between social classes.  Did anyone else find the Moray character overly intense and creepy?  Touching Denise's hair, making comments about how she looked, standing really close and whispering to her...made me cringe, but they did play it down in later episodes.  Still, he is too oily and conniving as a business man to be much likeable.  I don't get the Katherine/Moray romance; other than being good looking, I don't see what he has to interest an upper class lady.  He has mountains of emotional baggage, is not really a gentleman, he clearly only started courting her to get a loan from Daddy, and has a total of zero time to be a husband.  Denise is much better, her business and marketing acumen is well balanced with her humanity.  She knows how to advertise and give people what they want without trying to trick them.  I liked the other characters too, thought their trials very age and period appropriate; although Clara has this fatal attraction thing that hardly ever goes anywhere.",1407888000,6,1122,4.8578947368421055

Following her brief but very interesting probationary term she earns a permanent place on staff at The Paradise. There is plenty of competition between the  workers and some (well of course) drama from the patrons. Moray, the store founder, constantly challenges himself to bring in new clients and endeavors to grow The Paradise substantially.

Denise, played by Joanna Vanderham, finds imaginative, wonderful solutions for the many predicaments and conundrums of working with the public. Especially one where class and propriety dictate. She never misses a beat when finding a fix, but she's still learning how to ""tactfully"" deliver.

""The Paradise"" is a great tv series. It is pretty entertaining and offers some comedic value. I find myself very relaxed when I curl up and watch.  I won't rush out to purchase the next season, but, I will keep on eye on it. When it is available for free on my streaming service, I will definitely add it to my list.",1401235200,2,1073,4.977653631284916
5774209,3,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise [Au Bonheur des Dames (The Ladies' Delight or The Ladies' Paradise)], based on the 11th installment of a French series by Emile Zola, has been completely reformatted and rewritten as the British version of the book.

Denise Lovett (Joanna Vanderham) is a country bumpkin with big dreams but sharp business instinct. She moves to the big city, seeking employment at one of England's first retail department stores geared toward women, for women: The Paradise. The man behind this innovative notion is rags-to-riches businessman John Moray (Emun Elliott), a man haunted by the death of his beloved wife while driven by the need to succeed and make The Paradise a household name--by any means necessary.

This eight episode shows the daily activities of the shop and its employees as much as the intrigue of Moray, and his highbrow love interest, Katherine Glendenning (Elaine Cassidy), the daughter of a wealthy banker helping to finance an expansion. Under the soap opera episodes is the economic upheavals brought on by a mass market retail shop slowly overtaking small businesses in that area--including Denise's feisty pig-headed uncle Edmund (Peter Wight), a local dressmaker--as well as the social interchanges between the haves and the have nots.

I have not read the book so I have no idea how close of an 'adaptation' the TV version is to the book but no matter. I did enjoy elements of *this* Paradise, such as the actors who all did quite well (though there was a lot of overacting in some scenes) as well as the costuming and music. It really made up for several caveats--specifically the plot (episodically as well as the overall arch for the whole season) and character development.

Ultimately, this boils down to the writing, which wasn't bad but did not deliver anything new or fresh or exciting. The first episode was handled poorly and so rushed. We were hardly introduced to the characters and background of the Paradise before we were expected to understand or decide if this character or that one were good, or bad for Denise. I had no idea what was going on other than Denise's entry into the Paradise. From there and into the next 2-3 episodes, there was a lot of inconsistency with character development and representation. All the characters, except Denise, were not established until the middle of the season, either one way or the other from episode to episode, and rather confusing. The romance between Denise and Moray was a bit stilted and forced though toward the end of the season, it becomes easier and the real chemistry blooms. This is where chemistry makes up for a lot. But like the mumbled mess of episode one, and a couple other episodes that felt rather random and uneven, the last episode leaves us at a cliffhanger and rather rushed.

While I think the acting was good, I think the writing limited the characters to really stretch themselves to the kind of performances that really pull at the heart strings, or creates a worthy advisory to root against. I think it also forced actors to portray their characters already based on characters before them--from Mr. Selfridge to Downtown Abby, any costume period British TV/Movie--rather than reaching for originality and seeking a different appeal. It sort of just relied on the fact that it's a period piece with elaborate costumes, etc. The set was obviously a set so, at times, there was a sense that it was on a theater stage and took away some of the sense of authenticity. Overall, there wasn't a lot of excitement, or rather, surprise and the sex appeal that the description supplies isn't fulfilled but only hinted at, and again, never really goes anywhere. The mild mystery of how Moray's wife died and it's very mild use to make the series seem darker, was a bit hackneyed and lackluster.

Despite my criticisms, The Paradise has a lot of potential and I look forward to seeing what Season 2 brings. I just hope the writing gets better and is less pedestrian.

The 'extras' was a basic and short background on the development of the show and the actor's perception of their characters. Meh.",1401148800,2,4102,4.859799713876967

5774214,5,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise is PBS's highest quality recent-year drama.  Its story lines, writing, acting, character complexity, dramatic intensity, romance, humor, and soundtrack surpass those features in the next-best recent comparable shows, Downton Abbey and Mr. Selfridge.  This became more evident to me upon repeat viewing of my Season 1 DVD.  The Paradise is at a higher artistic level.  It is enthralling and addictive.  Nearly all the other current and recent PBS dramas and murder mysteries rate far below it.

I'd like to point out two of the features, which some viewers may not have fully appreciated:

The soundtrack: Composer Maurizio Malagnini has created music that incomparably excels that in any other drama program I've ever seen.  ""...the lush beauty of the visuals and the incredible production values were a phenomenal source of inspiration for the music,"" he wrote.

It is of superior stature in the realm of recent-year music -- splendid and innovative, with enchantingly beautiful, sometimes jaunty, original melodies, and strong emotional content.  There is fine matching of the musical character to the variety of on-screen activity.  The score won a prestigious award, and a wonderful CD has been made which provides a spellbinding listening experience (with or without reference to the show).  The music could have been played louder in places on the show.

The humor: Unlike the other two mentioned programs, The Paradise Season 1 offers numerous and various funny things.  Perhaps they should have included a laugh track (just kidding!).

The story seems unfinished and should continue beyond Season 2 at whose end remain manifold opportunities for the creation of incidents and episodes and for the further development of The Paradise saga.

The cancellation after Season 2 is an affront to its many devoted (and donating) viewers, and a dereliction of the public service obligation of public-funded, nonprofit, TV stations to keep their program quality as high as possible and continue an unfinished program to a satisfying conclusion.

So, armed with several reasons to continue the series, I'm writing PBS, Masterpiece, and the BBC to urge them to heed the many passionate fans of this great program who want to see more, a Season 3 at least.",1400457600,3,2264,5.2444444444444445

5774218,4,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise comes from the creator of Larkrise to Candleford, features a couple of the same actresses, and has the same slow, quiet tone. Coming straight off another period show that was all melodrama and scandal, I found this one a pleasant change of pace. I can understand why The Paradise was canceled after only two seasons -- a lot of viewers won't have the patience for it. The tension is low and the story focuses on small incidents in the daily lives of the characters. There's no extramarital affairs, no shocking secrets, nobody is ever hovering on the verge of social ruin. At least, not in season one (I've yet to watch season two). The viewer basically sits back and basks in the historical costumes and settings, while mildly hoping the sympathetic characters get what they want in the end. It's not brilliant but it's pleasant and will be a breath of fresh air for anyone tired of the soapier shows.",1399507200,3,915,4.654320987654321

Though there are some historical inaccuracies (my second love), overall, I an enamored.  I love the characters, the scenes, the costumes, the dialogue.  Occasionally, as with Moray, I distrust some behaviors and actions of the characters.  Moray seems to be too much a victim of what is happening around him.  In general, men of business are controlling and money-hungry.  And even if something happens to them, it does not victimize them.  They aren't the victim types.  Though based on The Ladies' Paradise by Emile Zola, the two works only have a passing resemblance.  Either way, I recommend it.",1398038400,,772,4.9147286821705425

I wondered whether it was influenced by Mr. Selfridge which preceded it on my TV or whether it is due to the writing of Emile Zola, an author Ive never read. But there is a lot of talent that aided in the final production that we never appreciate without knowledge of what goes into making a film like this. If we were to know the story behind each of the names listed in the credits, we would probably have a better idea.  The acting is very good, the actors are superb, very convincing and comfortable in their roles and the character development is so good as to make the viewer look forward to what is to come next. The women are beautiful, the men handsome (each in his own way, even Jonas if you think about it).  Their destiny concerns us but the continuity of the series has a few bumps in it between the first and second seasons from what little Ive been able to find out on the Internet.  I fear the screenwriters aren't stretching this out enough or perhaps have ended up in a drunken stupor due to writers block.  I hope not.  I recorded the series as it appeared on my TV but found that they deleted scenes which appear on DVD and that makes me feel Masterpiece Theater has cheated me!  Many will disagree with me and consider the omitted material inconsequential but then perhaps you are too easily pleased.

I can't wait until I can find season 2 on DVD or digital download.",1392595200,,395,4.850746268656716
5774274,5,B00D49YEHO,Loved this series and cannot wait for series two. Love the period costumes and way of life for the working class!,1392508800,,113,4.428571428571429
5774275,4,B00D49YEHO,"Would have given it 5 stars but as long as 5 stars is defined ""I love it"" am limited to 4 stars.  I happened upon this PBS TV series one night  I and have been ""addicted"" ever since.  I was very happy when the DVD became available.  One thing about having the DVD is that I can fast forward and bypass the scenes I do not like.  I would have liked the sound to be a little more adjustable; I watch this on my laptop and feel the sound could be a little louder.",1392336000,,460,3.851063829787234
5774276,5,B00D49YEHO,"I enjoyed the TV series, wanted to share it with friends and family. I am hoping there is a season 2",1392249600,,100,3.8095238095238093
5774277,5,B00D49YEHO,Wonderful period piece.  It seems true to the time in which it takes place.  Great character development. I can't wait for season 2 to come out.,1392163200,,144,4.5
5774278,5,B00D49YEHO,the backdrop was convincing and the story line flowed wonderfully.  The actors and actresses were suberb.  I wish there had been more seasons. This show simply reminded you of how retail became so big when it really was about the customers.  Yet the struggles of the shop girls back tthen had to go through.  I reccomend this strongly.,1392163200,,335,4.724137931034483
5774279,5,B00D49YEHO,"I highly recommend this wonderful,eventful movie. I adored the characters , each with their own lively personalities. It was just like a good book ,I couldn't put it down. Yes, I want more. Thank you for putting me in the middle of this town I had fun.",1392076800,,252,4.382978723404255
5774280,5,B00D49YEHO,"Very heat felt and the characters are relatable. I love the heorine Denise and how she is head strong but, respectufl with a soft touch. I was suprised by the first season's ending. Can't wait for season 2 to see how it all plays out. lol",1391990400,,238,4.195652173913044
5774281,5,B00D49YEHO,"It is easy to like and understand all characters. Denise was very lucky in that kind of society! I went ahead and read the original novel written by Emile Zola and found that the english adaptation done for this TV series, focuses more on characters and romance while Zola focuses more on the creation and booming of the store-by-department phenomenon on Parisian society and the devastating effects on the small shop and their owners life. If this TV series would have been done by a frenchperson, it would have been different. I would like to find more about this subject (not as extensively and exagerated like Zola did) in England, France and Europe in general, where boutiques are still so much alive and triving even in this new century and where big, department stores are really the minority mainly in cities other than at the country capital.",1391990400,,851,4.795918367346939

5774285,4,B00D49YEHO,It's similar to Mr Selfridge but is much lighter and without the dark side of his personality. Story centers around the trials and tribulations of a country girl working in retail who has a knack for marketing.,1391644800,,210,4.702702702702703
5774286,5,B00D49YEHO,We want to see more . Hopefully Season two is in the making we are waiting for it. Soon Please.,1391472000,,95,3.8
5774287,4,B00D49YEHO,The characters are not quite as developed as Downton Abbey.  However the story line was appealing and I was drawn into following their troubled lives.  I will be looking forward to season two.,1391472000,,192,4.787878787878788
5774288,5,B00D49YEHO,This is an wonderful show and I was excited to find it on Amazon. Looking forward to next season already.,1391472000,,105,4.3
5774289,4,B00D49YEHO,"The characters are rich and complex. Their problems and the complications of their lives are shown compassionately, and, I think, fairly.  I really enjoy the period details as well--clothing, social status, homes & autos, and so on are portrayed in a way that makes me understand that period of time.  And, I love the modest girl who has big ambition!",1391385600,,351,4.833333333333333
5774290,5,B00D49YEHO,Just a traditional love story but beautifully written and the actors are great. Verty victoriana with wonderful attention to detail.,1391385600,,132,5.65
5774291,5,B00D49YEHO,"Wonderful acting! Wonderful story! It is nice to be able to watch something that is wholesome and the whole family can enjoy. We have turned off network & cable TV, and are watching more movies like ""The Paradise"".",1391040000,,214,4.657894736842105
5774292,5,B00D49YEHO,"This is a sweet romance, with a little bitter to it.  Love that. Would like to see another season that follows Denise and Mr. Moray.",1391040000,,132,4.28
5774293,3,B00D49YEHO,"Not bad, not good... Sets are atrocious, like the back lot on some studio. Costumes are great, but story isn't all that exciting. It's just okay...",1391040000,2,147,4.6923076923076925

5774295,2,B00D49YEHO,"Clearly, this is an attempt to share in the success of the popularity of ""Mr. Selfridge.""  First episode has not inspired me to watch the rest of this series.  Waiting for the next season of ""Mr. Selfridge.""",1390867200,2,207,4.5675675675675675
5774296,4,B00D49YEHO,Love to see the old England. Takes me back to how my country used to be.  Charming tv series. Not quite up to Downton Abbey standards but still thoroughly enjoyable.,1390867200,,165,4.5
5774297,5,B00D49YEHO,"This series started as a time-filler and ended up being one of the best things I've seen this year. It's beautifully done, and even if the story is a bit slow at the beginning, it starts moving after a few episodes. Highly recommended to anyone who likes period drama.",1390867200,,268,4.489795918367347
5774298,5,B00D49YEHO,I really enjoy the depth of each of the characters in the series.  It is very well produced and at the level of Downton Abbey.,1390867200,,126,4.04

5774300,5,B00D49YEHO,"Loved this series! I know some people loved Mr. Selfridge, but that one did not really draw my attention. I haven't watched that, so can't really compare. But this one was intriguing from start to finish, and a well balanced story with several very endearing characters. Can't wait for season 2 to be released.",1390867200,,310,4.7592592592592595
5774301,3,B00D49YEHO,good story just to long in getting to the point not as good as some of the other British shows.  Did not finish watching the episodes to drawn out.,1390867200,3,147,4.068965517241379

5774307,5,B00D49YEHO,My husband and I have been watching several BBC/Masterpiece movies. The Paradise is absolutely the best.  Shall I admit we have watched it 3 times since purchasing it a month ago? The acting is superb and the characters are believable.  It is impossible not to get involved with the story.  Can't wait until the next season is out.,1390089600,,331,4.672413793103448
5774308,5,B00D49YEHO,If you like period pieces this one is fun to watch. It has a good storyline and good cast of characters. I want to know what is happening next. Can't wait to see the second season.,1390089600,,180,4.027777777777778

5774311,4,B00D49YEHO,I really love this series! Patiently waiting for Season 2 ..... I wish it was available to watch right away!,1390003200,,108,4.45
5774312,5,B00D49YEHO,"The story depicts the lives and loves of the people who work, shop and trade, in and around the ""first"" English department store.  Not only is it splendidly executed (costumes, homes, parties)  the real draw is the way the various characters are developed throughout the episodes. For me, the most emotionally captivating characters are John Moray, the owner of the Paradise who appears to be devoted to his deceased wife, Katherine Glendenning whose sole desire is to marry and possess Moray through her money and driving ambitions, and Denise, a small town poor shop girl who takes a job at The Paradise and is soon seen by Moray as ""his"" star. But there are so many other seemingly minor character developments that are so endearing! I watched it on PBS and loved it so much bought every episode on Amazon Instant Video (which I never do!) But this is so worth it- I have watched it so many times and keep going back! Please Give us the second season soon- I hear it is out.",1389916800,,977,4.577142857142857
5774313,5,B00D49YEHO,"What a pleasant surprise:  a period drama that has just the right mixture of British class conflict, social criticism, personal drama, and sentimentality.  It's a hard balance to strike, but they did it in this gem (in this respect, I think it compares very favorably with another favorite of mine, Downton Abbey).  I had never heard of this series; I was just lucky enough to stumble upon it while searching Amazon Video. The actors are excellent, and the characters, story, plot, and subplots are interesting and plausible.  I can't wait for the next season--I hope they can maintain the quality here.  Check it out; it's well worth your precious time.",1389916800,,654,4.909090909090909

5774320,5,B00D49YEHO,"I stumbled across this DVD quite by accident and decided to order it.  I cannot believe that I missed it's airing on PBS this past fall.  I absolutely love this series and cannot wait until Amazon has the second series available for sale on DVD. I am really hoping that the BBC will commission a third season.  I love Emun Elliott as John Moray, the charismatic owner of the The Paradise.  Hoping to see much more of him in the very near future.  This actor has the makings of a star.",1389571200,,484,4.274725274725275

5774326,5,B00D49YEHO,I love this series so much that I cannot wait until Season Two is available in the US.  I watched it over and over again and could never get enough of this story and its characters lives.,1389312000,,187,4.054054054054054

5774328,5,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise was not only captivating from beginning to end with great character development and a wonderful love story, but I also found it fascinating as an educational tool.  I learned so much by watching Denise and her innovation and also was intrigued by Mr. Moray and how he managed the people at the shop.  I'm so excited to see season 2 and can't wait until it's available in the United States! Thank you for some wonderful entertainment and education.",1389139200,,460,4.7375

5774331,4,B00D49YEHO,"My wife and I really enjoyed this series.  The casting for Denise is spot on.  Jonas is also a great character that seems like it could have come straight from a Dickens novel.

All in all, you really get to love these characters, and we were sad to see the end.  We're waiting for season 2.",1389052800,2,291,4.142857142857143

Nice to see the writer's depiction of the change from craft-hold stores to department store but it is a not-too-sticky love story too.

5774346,5,B00D49YEHO,"I originally watched the program on Masterpiece Theater. I wasn't sure I would like it at first, but it definitely drew me in and I couldn't wait to watch it each week.

I really looked forward to addting the DVD to my collection of Period Movies and can't wait for next season to start.",1388361600,,344,4.476190476190476
5774347,4,B00D49YEHO,"Masterpiece provides yet another incredible episodic drama. The set design was beautiful, and the acting was first rate.
Most of the costumes were interesting & lovely.  Yet, dome of Lady Glendenning's dresses were too ""crafty""  (With the unpalatable color combinations and little bows & rosettes....like they had just paid a visit to the local craft store.) & less couture-like, as one would expect from such a ""fashion forward"" icon, as was intimated by the show.
On the upside... It was interesting how she frequently wore a WHITE dress with a striking colored accent.  (Her white dress with black & red accoutrements was absolutely stunning!)
Overall, The Paradise was superb & I look forward to enjoying more seasons.",1388361600,,722,5.153846153846154

5774352,5,B00D49YEHO,I just love this series.  Started watching it from my iPod and just couldn't believe how well it is written. The story line of this large department store in England providing customers with so many choices is unique in that you just don't consider in the early 1900's a store like this was unheard of.  I love stories from this era and the attraction between Denise and John Moray Keeps you on pins and needles. Denise being from a lower class presents many challenges which she is able to handle with dignity.  The background music is so beautiful. Can't wait until the second series becomes available.,1388016000,,604,4.679245283018868

The acting is great. I love the chemistry between Emun Elliott and Joanna Vanderham. They are now my new favorite tv couple. Great new series.

5774377,5,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise erupts with stunning pre-Victorian costuming and sets. The background orchestration enhances the multi-threaded storyline. It's already into Season two, and expect more. This is a BBC must-OWN DVD set that stimulates repeated viewing. It is a sumptuous period costume series of haberdashery, notions, cobblestones, chicanery, toppers, and fraught with unrequited love.

It's not historic perfection, as the characters are ""LIKE"" the book written over 100 years ago, but only a couple have the same name. It takes place in London, not the original Paris setting. Many changes have occurred for the integrity of a delightful modern television audience, such as some architecture a bit earlier, more color than true to the time, but the changes have only accentuated the original novel of Emile Zola. There is an Emile Zola on the series writing credits; would love to know if there is a family relationship.
I find the cast outstanding, each portraying a character as finely as the costume demands. Denise (Joanna Vanderham -Young James Herriot) is beautiful and her vitality spills from the screen. Shop owner, Moray (Edmun Elliot) drives the department store and the show with his mix of emotional moments. Miss Aubrey (Sarah Lancashire -Last Tango in Halifax) is a tyrant and adversary of the young working girls. She was also outstanding in ""Lark Rise to Candleford"", as were several of ""The Paradise"" cast. i.e. Pauline (Ruby Bentall) with a fun characterization done exquisitely, so why is she dropped from the cast for season 2? Also from Lark Rise is a main character, Dudley (Matthew McNulty) always pleasing to the ladies' eye. The list is long.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 8 episodes
1--Victorian England's 1st department store, owned by widower Moray, hires a young country, Peebles, shop girl; beautiful, creative, and ambitious. Since staff lives in the premises, it is a bit of Upstairs, downstairs reversed.
2--In a bold unprecedented move of a store-wide low-price sale, The Paradise sets its reputation and market position for the future, a wealthy prospect.
3--This is an exceptionally emotional episode for all Paradise staff as a baby is abandoned in the department store. Olivia Hallinan (Lark Rise to Candleford) guest stars.
4--Head of ladies wear gets a pox and a temp replacement creates havoc when a new large patron is expected.
5--Moray's romantic proweresses conflict with The Paradise expansion. The devilish Jonas (David Hayman -Trial & Retribution) drives discontent behind the scene--even during ""Ladies After Dark"" shop promo.
6--Bird counter brightens the shop's entry but much distress is caused by romantic encounters, an assault, and an engagement announcement.
7--David Bamber (Pride and Prejudice) guest stars as Chisholm. The Paradise's streets' competitors co-op puts on marketing pressure while wedding plans proceed raucously.
8--A body floats I the river; turn-over in The Paradise staff; and activity bustles leading up to a wedding.
Bonus--interesting and with Subtitles.

It is escapism, it is a delightful truffle after a good meal.  There is no scenery-eating Kate Smith among the cast - plenty of good actors, very few ordinary ones and a story that will not change your life.  If you like dessert, you will love this show.

That was because I couldn't stand waiting each week for the next episode, and it was also because I wanted to watch it again with subtitles.  I am glad I indulged my impatience.  This is a corny but fascinating television drama.  (Enjoyably corny and hugely fascinating.)

It seemed to me that there were still too many loose ends after the final episode for there not to be another series, and I'm glad that viewers say there will be another one.  I had wondered whether the television ended where Zola ended, making it impossible to continue.  Sadly, we can't be mean to everyone, discussing the final episode.",1385078400,,739,4.595419847328245

There are only 8 episodes, and the performances are outstanding.  Decent script.  I have actually watched it twice now, the second time to focus on the sets and costumes, absolutely brilliant to the last detail.

The love story captured my interest from the start; the chemistry is palpable between newcomers Joanna Vanderham and Emun Elliott, who surprisingly carry the series with the command of much more seasoned actors.  No doubt this is a career-launcher for both of them.

My only disappointment is that Season Two will be available in Britain next month; I hope we don't have to wait too long before it airs here!",1384646400,3,747,4.7

Since Mr. Selfridge was thoroughly enjoyable, that is not a bad thing. The Paradise is about a Britain's first department store starting out in London and gradually expanding until it takes up the whole neighborhood, swallowing smaller mom & pop shops. The store's owner, John Moray, a grieving widower, has an on-again, off-again relationship with his rich banker's daughter while lusting after the pretty country bumpkin employee who turned out to be an expert in retail in spite of her innocent youth. The characters are believable, the lush period clothing and sets a pleasure and the story line keeps you coming back episode after episode.

I like the characters and the actors.  It's a typical romance so really nothing new and it's no Downton Abby or Mr. Selfridge but it holds my attention. I like the time period.",1384387200,,363,4.3088235294117645

5774414,1,B00D49YEHO,"The BBC seldom lets the viewer down. This time it did - badly. Apart from anything else 'The Paradise' is boring. The pace is sooo slow.

The main problem is that the plot is clunky. Adapted from a Zola novel, it makes little sense set in 19th century England. The gentry didn't mingle with shopkeepers - at all. Young unmarried men didn't have intimate diners with upper middleclass women either.

Above all the UK was 'a nation of shopkeepers' - large stores were a natural evolution by the mid-19th century. The resentment of the failing small shopkeeper was a French attitude.",1384300800,12,580,4.732673267326732
5774415,5,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise is a wonderful series that transports you back in time to an earlier era...the characters are worth loving and detesting, the plot keeps you intrigued and wanting more.  I am watching the series on PBS right now and each time the episode ends I groan...""No!""  See if you feel the same.  It's just delightful!",1384300800,,321,4.696428571428571
5774416,5,B00D49YEHO,"There's nothing I'd rather watch than a costume drama produced by BBC and Masterpiece Theatre. The Paradise, the latest series to come from a collaboration between the Beeb and PBS, is one series that captures the heart and the imagination unlike any other. With lush sets, complex characters, and a terrific storyline, The Paradise is sure to please those who can't get enough of a good, clean story.

Set in the latter half of the 19th century, The Paradise gives viewers a peek into the lives of those responsible for establishing a department store and keeping it afloat. But that's not all, glimpses into the everyday lives of all involved from the orphaned errand boy to the wealthy Glenndennings give the series its light-hearted moments as well as high drama. Starring relative newcomers Emun Elliott and the beautiful Joanna Vanderham as well as seasoned veterans, Elaine Cassidy and Sarah Lancashire, the department store of yore is brought to life in an intriguing and subtly sexy manner!

From the very first heated glance between Denise Lovett and John Moray to the last breathtaking scene of the finale, it's difficult to take your eyes off of the screen. Denise's wide-eyed, country girl innocence, Moray's take charge, brook no nonsense character, the very creepy and strangely loyal Jonas, and the bubbly and silly shop girl Pauline are the stars of this story. This series has less sordid and overall more appealing story-lines than this year's other department store drama, Mr. Selfridge. Moray is far more likable and more genuine a character than Selfridge and Elliott is a thousand times more suited for the role than Piven for Selfridge. While I preferred the more authentic store setting at Selfridge's over The Paradise, there's no question that The Paradise is the better series.

Similar to Lark Rise to Candleford, The Paradise offers a quality of entertainment that is second to none and is a great series to watch with the entire family!

The Paradise, Season One is available now on DVD and Blu-ray from retailers.

Selfridge Department store was a good offering, but I don't really care for the performance of Jeremey Piven that much.  Then comes an offering called The Paradise, and I was literally ""quite surprised."" This show has exceeded my expectation in the absence of Downton Abbey and Selfridge. I really found myself drawn into this show by the performances and the characters are much more believable. Not as over the top as Selfridge Department store. It is a mystery, drama and most of all the dearest of love stories I have seen in quite sometime. You will not be wasting your time by watching this.",1384128000,15,688,4.773109243697479

Okay, there are plenty of detailed reviews here of this BBC production which, though created before the ITV production of ""Mr. Selfridge"" - another story about the owner of a British department store- made it's appearance on PBS's Masterpiece Theater more recently, so I won't repeat much of the information and do my best not to provide any ""spoilers"".

 The DVD and Bluray home video versions (I watched the BD) came out later as well.
You'll find my review of ""Mr. Selfridge"" here on Amazon and I honestly have to say that I enjoyed both. They are ""similar"" yet ""different"". MS is historical fiction and takes place just after 1900; TP was written (in a novel by Emile Zola) to take place in the mid-1800s but was updated to the later 1800s for the television version. Both focus on the owner of the department store as well as his love interest - whether it is his wife or his fiance. And there are side stories about the employees in the store. And both DVD/BDs are of ""Season One"", so there will be followups.

""The Paradise"" consists of eight episodes - each running 61 minutes for a total of just over eight hours.  I found myself so engrossed in it, that I started ""binge watching"" with two or three episodes each night. As I got to the end, I wasn't sure that the stories would be completed or whether there is a ""cliff hanger"". After all, I'd invested eight hours of my life to following the story line.  I feel that I will prevent you from really enjoying this series by telling you much about the plot and really recommend that you be judicious in reading reviews with spoilers. The important thing to know when Season One ends is that there IS a Season 2, though not yet released in the US - and no target date listed. A little research (not much; I want to be surprised too) showed that Season Two picks up one-year after the action in Season One ends. How you feel about the ending of Season One will depend on which characters you associated with.

As for the cast, they are wonderful though I couldn't quite understand the inner thoughts of John Moray - the department store owner (who surprisingly everyone - including his fiance - call him only by his last name!). But I was smitten (and you will surely be also) by actress Joanna Vanderham as the new sales clerk who works her way up the ""ladder"" with her brilliant marketing ideas. She is both GORGEOUS and smart.

The plot involves two major themes: ""secrets"" and ""loyalty"". They form the basis for most every scene.

The images on the BD are just glorious and sharp. There is one bonus feature which adds to the enjoyment of the show (but don't watch until after you have seen all eight episodes). It's a 30-minute ""Behind The Scenes"" featuring comments by most of the major cast members (and it's then that you know ""who played who"") as well as the production team.

I guess if there is a weakness to this BD (and reason I'm giving it only four stars) it is that not all the loose ends are tied up and you are left hanging in the end awaiting the (possible) release of Season Two.  It would have been better to feel fulfilled at the conclusion and - for me, at least - it didn't happen.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5774422,3,B00D49YEHO,"Why are the British so obsessed with retail? First Mr. Selfridge, which was a badly acted bore.  Now The Paradise, which is better made and better acted, but still boring. But the worst thing about The Paradise is that this is a story (by Emile Zola) with a  completely French sensibility which is very badly translated into Victorian English. All that seduction and the way people talk about it and react to it would simply not have been tolerated by proper Brits. And yes, I realize that things went on under the radar among Victorians, but these people are way too openly French in their actions and reactions.",1383436800,7,613,4.666666666666667

5774431,5,B00D49YEHO,"To a young Scottish country woman in the 1880's, the allure of a big city in Northern England offers shops, suitors, sin and seduction. At least, that is what is being served up in The Paradise. Are we ready for one more English period drama in which the costumes star as much as the actors? Of course we are. The 1880's are one of the prettiest fashion decades ever with ruffles, folds, pleats, bustles, lace, decollette, and the hour-glass silhouette accompanied by a parasol and a fetching hat. The men are dapper, too.

In this series, country girl Denise Lovett (Joanna Vanderham of WHAT MAISIE KNEW) is hired to work at The Paradise shop by the shop's deeply dimpled, bedroom-eyed owner, Mr. John Moray (Emun Elliott of BLACK WATCH and GAME OF THRONES). Whispered rumors of the suspicious death of Moray's rich young wife swirl around Lovett. Although Moray is courting another lady, Katherine Glendenning (Elaine Cassidy of HARPER'S ISLAND) from a gentrified family of wealth, it's clear to us, the audience, that Moray is intensely attracted to our country lass Lovett. And his intentions toward the innocent Lovett may not be honorable. Part of the dramatic tension is that you can't tell if Moray is a total cad, or might be redeemable and protect young Lovett's virtue.

Is Lovett attracted to him? Possibly, almost certainly, but she confesses she doesn't want to marry him, she wants to BE him. She is creative, spirited and plucky, so she may be a match for his ambition.

Based on the 1883 Emile Zola novel ""Au Bonheur des Dames"" (""The Ladies Paradise""), this production was created and written by Bill Gallagher who produced LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD. For those of us who can't get enough of these costumed English period dramas, this will probably be a five star bit of fluff, fripperies and frivolity for us.",1381190400,14,1824,4.821086261980831
5774432,5,B00D49YEHO,"The Paradise is the new Masterpiece Theater series that started Sunday, Oct. 6.  Amazon viewers are almost unanimous in their praise of this fine program.

We are immediately introduced to our heroine Denise, well played by Joanna Vanderham, who has just come to the city from the country.  She tries to get a job from her uncle, but his store is being slowly put out of business by an exciting new department store called The Paradise.  Denise applies for and is given a job on probation as a trainee in dress sales.

The owner of The Paradise, Mr. Moray, played well by Emun Elliott, is determined to make his establishment the finest store of its kind in England.  He has plenty of good ideas, but lacks the money to put his ideas into practice.  He seeks financial assistance from Lord Glendenning, well played by the veteran actor Patrick Malahide. Lord Glendenning takes an interest in Moray only because his daughter loves the young man and begs her father to help him.  It appears that Moray takes advantage of young Lady Glendenning because she is useful to him, but he finds country girl Denise with her bright intelligence, attractive looks, and good ideas more to his liking.

The conflicts in the story come from many sources.  First, paying the bills and developing the business bring Moray into many disagreements with his conservative partner.  Then the shop girls with their high spirits have a variety of problems keeping out of trouble.  Lastly, and the focus of the first installment, a draper in the store is caught kissing the friend of young Lady Glendenning and is danger of being sacked.  All these plot lines are well connected and the writing, acting, and directing are first-rate.

The Paradise has the excellent production values that we expect from Masterpiece Theater.  It looks good and succeeds in pulling us in to the world of the high end department store where much of the action of the story takes place.  I have only seen the first program in the series, but am already looking forward to next Sunday and part two of this entertaining adaptation of Emile Zola's fine novel, The Ladies Paradise, which is now available on Kindle.

I will update this review after watching the show next week.

Update one: The second installment of The Paradise presented an interesting problem: What should Moray do with a newborn baby left abandoned in the store.  True to his character, he decided to care for the baby in the store and use the child as a promotional device to build sales.  Of course, Denise has ideas about how to turn the problem of caring for the child into an opportunity to expand the services of the store.  This second installment provided much human interest and also helped us learn more about the important characters in the series.  I enjoyed the second installment even more than the first, perhaps because I now know the extensive cast of characters who each have their problems that are cleverly related to the discovery and care for The Paradise baby.  I look forward to next week and the continuing story of The Paradise.  Highly recommended.

Update two: Miss Audrey,in charge of dress sales and well-played by Sarah Lancashire, becomes ill and takes to her bed.  Denise is named to replace her.  Denise convinces Mr. Moray that Miss Audrey's illness is stress related and that he should praise and reward her, which he does; she becomes well and returns to work.  Additionally, Miss Glendenning decides to renew her romance with Moray.  This third episode of the series lacked the drama and conflict of the first two installments.  I trust that the series will return to form next week.

Update three:  The Paradise has taken a dramatically different turn in Epidode Three by introducing a bit of skullduggery.  Moray buys out a barber who owns a shop across the street from The Paradise by offering him a limited partnership in the business.  The barber turns out to be an embarrassment and Moray wants to get rid of him, but Mr. Jonas tells Moray that the barber has dangerous secrets about the mysterious death of Moray's wife.  The plot thickens.  Meanwhile, Denise continues to contribute useful ideas to the store.  This was an excellent installment and a return to form for the series.

Update four: Denise has now left The Paradise to work with her uncle, a dressmaker whose shop across the street from The Paradise has fallen on hard times.  This marks a new beginning for this excellent series.  Now Denise has a chance to practice her entrepreneurial skills.  She brings other store owners on the street together to form a cooperative to compete with The Paradise and is initially successful only to fail in the end.  The plucky Denise is now the central character in this fine series.  That being said, we can expect twists and turns to keep us interested in The Paradise and the extensive cast of characters.  I look forward to Sunday evening and a new installment of this fine Masterpiece Theater program.

Final update: Instead of tying up plot strands neatly to end the first season of The Paradise, much is left unresolved.  We must wait patiently to pick up the story of Moray and Denise, the Glendennings (father and daughter), Miss Audrey, Mr. Jonas, etc.  We are given strong hints about what will happen when we resume our story, but we can't be sure we are correct -- just what the filmmakers want, to keep us in suspense.

I, for one, will be coming back to The Paradise next season.  This series fits nicely into the tradition of high quality programs we have come to expect from Masterpiece Theater.  Highly recommended.",1381190400,115,5603,4.773388773388773
5774433,5,B00D49YEHO,"This is such an charming mini-series. I haven't seen Mr Selfridge, so I didn't have any comparisons getting in the way of my enjoyment. If I were to compare it to anything, I would compare it to Lark Rise to Candleford. Not really the same; more of the same feel but with an edge. LOVE it! I'm so happy to see it is finally going to be released in region 1 for all of us here in the U.S.",1381104000,5,387,3.911392405063291

8589464,4,B00D49YEHO,"I remember when this aired on PBS, but I didn't try it until recently when I wanted something clean to watch on Netflix during a sitting job. I thought the first episode was interesting and decided to continue watching. It wasn't until Episode 4 when I started really getting into it and growing attached to the characters. The end scene of Season 1 rivals the romance from BBC's 2004 North and South end scene (*sigh*). I read other reviews that say Season 2 is not as good and many of the reviewers cited reasons for saying so. Their reasons sound legit enough for me, so for now I have decided not to pursue Season 2 and bade farewell to the characters at the end of Season 1, which personally leaves a satisfying closure.

While there is no visual sexuality, some situations that happened in the past are discussed but not in great detail. I don't remember language and there is no violence. It is an overall clean, romantic show with a hint of mystery that I'd recommend to people who enjoy British period dramas.

I also recommend listening to the soundtrack. The music is a lovely blend of keyboard and strings.",1530576000,,1118,4.557213930348259

8589466,4,B00D49YEHO,"I actually got into a good portion of this.  I love period dramas and enjoy the costumes as much as the story.  I would have liked to see a season three, but not if they insist on injecting modern social mores.  So-----is every ""period"" piece now going to have a homosexual scene in it?  Just gotta check that box, eh.  Any lame excuse will do.  Truth and accuracy have nothing to do with it.  Also I found it irritating that our heroine chose a feminist stance for a career over a dark, handsome, financially successful and attentive man.  One that obviously loved her.  And why??  Because he dared to tell her in a most romantic and loving way (during a conversation about The Paradise store) that SHE was his most prized possession [rather than the store].  But that just wasn't good enough for this pouty girl.  She sulked off refusing to be anybody's possession.  He should have let her go.  That was such a stretch it felt forced and even ridiculous.
