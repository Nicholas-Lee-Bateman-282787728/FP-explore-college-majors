Had it been labeled ""Ancient Athens' Legacy to Western Civilization"" it would most certainly earn a 5 star rating from me.  If you can forgive the overly narrow scope, it is an exemplary documentary on ancient Athens.  Its visuals and narratives are superior.  After viewing, if this doesn't make you want to go to Athens and experience everything first hand, then quite frankly you're not the historian of the ancient world that you think you are.",1459382400,,538,4.868131868131868

2214793,1,B0007KIFUA,"The problem I have is that this is painted in modern values in so far as to be almost propaganda. The attack of the Persians is painted as a hatred for the democracy of the Athenians, absolute twaddle. No mention of the Ionian attack on Darius leading to the war, nothing from Herodotus, just basically the middle east hates democracy.

Then using the word democracy to promote virtues in a modern world ( ""Democracies produce better and larger armies"" for example) are just totally off the mark. History is judged in the time it happened. Greek democracy is so far removed from modern democracy as to be unrecognizable. To attribute all the virtues and gains of Athens as it happened then under their Democratic system to today's ""democracy"" is flawed to the point of criminal propaganda,

If I were cynical I could equate the tale spun here as a propaganda allegory th the rise of the USA . Throws off tyrant, is attacked by evil rest of world, peloponnesian (civil war), beacon to rest of world. Except it wasn't that way then (or now).",1439251200,,1039,4.641304347826087

My only quibble is the underplaying, in fact the abnegation really of Sparta's role in turning back Xerxes invasion.  While all beneficiaries of democracy ought to be partial to Athens, as I am, it doesn't seem fair to deny Sparta any worthwhile accomplishments.  It makes this

2214853,4,B0007KIFUA,"This was fascinating information about early Greece (really, Athens only) emphasizing its growth as an empire and how democracy started there. Then... all of a sudden ... Socrates appears and, just a few minutes later, we hear the story of his death for the crime of independent thinking (i.e. questioning everything, including the society and government).

Then, in just a few sentences, the narrator (Liam Neesom) tells us Athens turned away from empire building abroad and ""to the empire of intellect that changed everything.""  The End.

Yes, there were earlier mentions of Greek dramas like Oedipus, and brief mentions of a very philosophers like Thales. But Aristotle? Plato? So many others? Barely a sentence.

Where is the rest of this? And, if this is all there is, what a shame for all that was left out that could have replaced the emphasis on battles with Sparta and with the Persians. That is important, certainly, but not more important than Greek contributions to philosophy, science, mathematics, music, art and literature.  This documentary does a very, very poor job with all of those, but I gave it 4 stars just because it -did- have content and it -did- keep my interest throughout. Still, disappointing, unless it is part of a series on the Greek Empire that I can't find.",1410825600,,1292,4.935483870967742

5.0 out of 5 stars Interesting both to me and my 10 years old son, December 22, 2013
By
M. Kraeva ""Amazone"" (USA) - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)
This review is from: The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization (Amazon Instant Video)
We watched this movie with my son, and he did not want to stop watching. The movie is well made. It explains what happened in Ancient Greece (about 500BC), in particular in Athens.

I have posted on Youtube my critique of this insidious 3 part series (search ""The Greeks critique"" & you'll find them, by 'Jackie TwoSticks')

The creators of The Greeks were looking into the future, to the young people whose parents or teachers wanting to their kids to learn about ancient Greece. The production is VERY handsome and slick, and easy to understand.

But it is a character assassination of Socrates, the Persians, and the arts. The treatment of Socrates is masterful: he is one of the greatest minds ever, the documentary tells us, but the script makes a mockery of Socrates mind and thought, setting him in a ""drunken dinner party"" and as the voice over tells of his greatness the visuals linger on spilled wine, bones from the meal and assorted garbage.

I spent many many hours looking at this and doing research. What surprised me most was seeing that the documentary was deeply enmeshed with several members and affiliates of the Project for a New American Century (PNAC). This group of ""neo-cons"" were, when the documentary was filming, hoping for a ""new Pearl Harbor"" (their language) and were already planning the wars of the 21st century: Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and ... IRAN! Wow.

So this handsome, 3 part documentary was a nice vehicle to further their poisonous ideas, and I'm sure it was in their clever minds to look down the road, to the young people of the future, and how those young minds could be nudged into, or receive confirmation of several important ideas that fuels the Empire: the no-class status of women/prostitutes; the value and glory of war especially against tyrants like the Persians; the very over-rated value of the mind: the real message is that Socrates (and all 'thinkers') are ugly, ridiculous idiots, and the arts, too, are ridiculous, little better than modern slasher movies. Even the Parthenon is limned as fine but a huge burden on taxpayers and for what? To glorify a heathen goddess who is not much different than a prostitute.

My capsule summary may sound a tad overblown but if you take the trouble to view the critique you'll see that my reasoning and analysis is sound, and you'll educate yourself in the tricks of the propaganda trade.",1393459200,,2742,4.735849056603773
2214890,5,B0007KIFUA,Good presentation of factual history well performed good background material nice to see a history performance that has not been overblown with nutty fake scenes,1392940800,,161,5.48
2214891,4,B0007KIFUA,"A very in depth and comprehensive look at the rise of Greek culture. Although the focus is on Athens, which could confuse people given the title, you begin to understand how much Athens truly influenced Greece and the rest of the world. The video is intriguing, entertaining, and suspenseful. A great tool for anyone looking to learn about or integrate into the classroom a clear, but not overly pack with information, explanation and description of early Greek culture and the rise of democracy.",1391385600,,496,4.9879518072289155
2214892,3,B0007KIFUA,"As part of the ""Empires"" series, this DVD, ""The Greeks: Crucible of Civilization"" tells the story of Hellas as the classical Greeks called their land.

The DVD focuses on four men and the eras they represented. Beginning with Cleisthenes, who is viewed as the ""father"" of Greek democracy, the video tells the story of how the small farming village began and how it evolved into a democracy. It does tell the story of the tyrants and rebellion against Athens' early rulers and the part played by Cleisthenes who, though he was a nobleman, chose to side with the common freeman and develop the system of government that was the forerunner of all democracies.

The video then turns a spotlight on Themistocles and the struggle against the mighty Persian empire. The video tells of the first incursion culminating in the battle of Marathon - a signal victory for the Hellenes. It shows the part played by Themistocles in the preparation for the coming, larger struggle with Persia which Themistocles correctly foresaw. Covers the battle of Salamis where the fruits of Themistocles' preparations for war ripened in the form of an effective navy of triremes that formed the core of Greek strength at sea.

The DVD then moves on to the parallel lives of two men: Pericles and Socrates. Pericles was the noble who convinced Athenians to create the great works of art and architecture which showed that Athens was an up-and-coming player on the world stage as well as his decision to make war on Sparta and her allies. Socrates, living at the same time, was the rational, logical examiner of everything he saw. The DVD introduces the viewer to some of the Greek advancements in science and mathematics which would form the core of western ideals on science and logical thought.

The DVD does deal with Athens' decline and defeat in the Peloponnesian war. It examines some of the mistakes made by Athenian leadership and how the Sicilian venture sealed their fate.

Though this is generally a good video, I have some very sharp criticisms. Firstly, the video tells that before the battle of Marathon, Athens had sought help from Sparta only to be refused. This is wrong! The Spartans told the Athenians that they would come to their aid when their religion permitted them to march. As a point of fact, the Spartan army reached Athens the day after the battle after force marching 140 miles in only three days - an amazing feat for the time.

Secondly, Pericles gets off pretty easy for his imperial ambitions for Athens and championing making war on Sparta. Not only was it hubris, but it was an offensive act of an ""imperial"" leader interested in glory and empire. This is the antithesis of the democracy that fights for homeland and people. He was the one who convinced Athenians to abandon their farms and homes to ""hide"" behind their impenetrable walls of the city thus making them dangerously crowded - just the conditions for plague and disease to run rife. If the Athenians had fought the Spartans on their own soil - even in a defeat - the Spartans would not have imposed the harsh peace that they later did impose after years of war and destruction when attitudes could only harden toward an enemy.

Thirdly, the DVD focuses entirely on Athens, rather than the Classical Greek civilization, politics and culture in general. The many contributions in these areas by other city-states are ignored completely. The Spartans, with their radically different culture, could have been the counterpoint to the culture of other Greeks, Athenians as well as others.

In short, I think this DVD is well-made, richly filmed with good re-enactments and cinematography but missing the boat on many points of fact. I give it three stars.",1389398400,,3720,4.856466876971608

What this video lacked was analysis of the democratic system that Athens used as it's primary form of government.  For American audiences this would have been quite helpful.  We tend to throw around the term ""democracy"" a lot in America, yet technically the United States is not officially a democracy, but a constitutional republic.  One needs to notice that when Athens adopted their democratic system they had no means of checks and balances, they had no executive officer (president) even though someone with leadership skills rose to the top in directing and advising.  This is why at one point Athens experienced mob rule.  It is amazing that they did not experience this more often.  So more could have been said on their form of government.

It presents a superficial history of battles and personalities without ever animating the Greek spirit. This program will tell you what happened, but not *why* it happened. The most important thing about the Greeks is their view of the world, which is only lightly touched on - mostly focusing on Socrates, who is not a typical exemplary of Greek thought (but he is an exemplary of *modern* thought). Plato and Aristotle are only mentioned.

2214932,1,B0007KIFUA,"Honestly my friends, I will now play the roll of Socrates and have most of you pissed and annoyed. No hemlock though. As a student of Greek and Roman history, philosophy and culture, this presentation came off to me as laughable. Don't get me wrong, a few hours is understandably a short period of time to review essentially Athenian culture/history (this is not really about Greece, or Hellenistic culture--just Athens). If man is the measure of all things...this documentary is the measure of a very few things, and not quite adequately either...

However, along with the insane lack of substance and actual information (covered in other reviews) -- the focus of the presentation is limited and slanted to a populist, post-modernist approach to history. Very careful words are chosen to show us why this ahem...""democracy""...was quite wonderful...and laid the groundwork for the wonderful ideas to come...except that this was a dictatorship, at best based on Mob Rule + Elite Rule. As a foundation for a Republic with enshrined individual rights, Greece is the great beginning...but that's not the focus here.

The biggest laugh I had was essentially attributing Socrates, not as a precursor, but as THE Father of Reason. Sorry but Socrates is the father of Modern (not ancient) Skepticism and a lot of other lousy ideas that if put into practice, would have made this dvd impossible. And Aristotle??? Haha -- the film says that he studied what? Zoology and Biology? Oh, true of course. They cover him for about 8 seconds. But the insane lack of focus on the most important thinker in our whole of human history...not even a segment on him??? Insane. Yes, it's like as if someone from a historical revisionist society decided to root their political philosophy in Ancient Athens and created a little fable, leaving out history, people, ideas, etc.--to make their truth conform to reality. Why would that be? What does Aristotle represent to modern scholars? Hmmmm. Kind of easy to figure that out...sadly.

There is a subtle and not so subtle slant to this whole presentation, with its moving music, unnecessary close-ups of half naked actors (enlarged pores and all), that aims to undermine the actual ""heroic"" achievement of the Greeks that it purports to highlight. That achievement is the concept of the Rational, Heroic, Political INDIVIDUAL. The modern man. The modern world. The West. Not based on Mob Rule. Not based on questioning everything. Not based on Group Rights or as Hitler or Stalin might put it...the Volk or ""the people"". The Greeks were at their best ""individualists"". But modern scholars take aim at the individual, and focus instead on what they wished ruled the world...the un-thinking masses...History my friends...History...not Man.

If you know nothing of the ancient world, and the TV is your primary educator, or if you enjoy modern Marxist interpretations of facts through the lens of ""the people"", you will enjoy this presentation. If on the other hand, you have a working brain and know that the entire presentation could not have existed without the very ideas/facts/history that it leaves out, you will walk away annoyed and disappointed.

2214933,4,B0007KIFUA,"I liked this program because it provided some detailed information about Greece that I'd never learned before.  I liked learning about the growth of Athens from a rugged mountain village to the center of a commercial empire.  I liked learning about four major individuals in depth, and about the political and cultural developments that influenced the wars of the time.

My caveats:  The film was quite full of pompous self-importance.  The producers could have included much more information if they didn't keep repeating that ""this was of great influence and significance for the future of Western civilization.""  Or making dramatic pauses.  It was tiresome and repetitious.  I think the video is good to introduce people (especially teens) to the study of Greece, to make it more than dry sculpture and convoluted philosophy, but I personally wouldn't buy it because I doubt I would watch it very often.

Liam Neeson couldn't have been a better pick or done a better job as narrator. His erudite yet unpretentious voice, coupled with his understated delivery--that of a great actor--give the film power, poise and pathos.

As a budding student of Classical Athens, I've read several sources on the subject (none better than Donald Kagan, who is featured in this film) and finished this film pleased at how it stands up to scholarship. Also, its aesthetic is masterful. I've never before seen the technique of standing period-dressed actors up as statues, then panning around them, but it makes much more of an impression than looking at real statues! This is done for all the protagonists: Cleisthenes, Themistocles, Pericles and Socrates.

2214961,5,B0007KIFUA,"This may be the best of PBS's 'Empires' series. Because the series' focus is on empire, this particular title inevitably focuses on Athens to the exclusion of almost all other Greek city-states (only Sparta plays a supporting role). Athens' rise from backwater to premier polis and head of a Greek empire in less than 200 years (the 6th to 5th centuries B.C.) is accomplished in roughly three parts:

1) The development of Athenian democracy: the result of a bad political situation turned positive. This segment is revolves around the life of Athens' leader Cleisthenes, the author of Athenian democracy, and sees the rise of Athens from minor town to major player on the Greek peninsula, in part due to agricultural exports (olive oil).

2) The transformation of Athens into a major Greek military power (rivaled only by Sparta) during the Persian war, and Athens' key role in the defeat of the Persians. This segment has as its anchor Themistocles, the Athenian general whose development of Athens' navy was crucial to the Greek's defeat of the Persians.

3) The rapid rise, and just as rapid decline, of Athens at its military and cultural height. Pericles is the leader who brings Athens to glory and to ruin (he both built the Parthenon and started the Peloponnesian War). Athens becomes the leader of an eastern-Mediterranean trading empire, and incurs the wrath of its neighbors when it gets a superiority complex. Pericles shares this segment with Socrates, who represents the new type of Greek hero: the rational man, in juxtaposition to the Greek's long-standing worship of the military hero. (Be forewarned: Plato and Aristotle barely get a mention.)

Supporting this narrative is voice-over by Liam Neeson, an esteemed selection of classical scholars (Victor Davis Hanson is probably the best known, and of course he weighs in on what he knows best: Greek agriculture and warfare), and the expected PBS standards: shots of costumed actors doing Greek-type things, marble sculptures, ruins, and a handful of computer-generated recreations. (And the DVD-ROM features are a nice bonus.)

In short, this is an excellent visual supplement to the rise of Athens and its contribution to what we typically understand as the beginnings of Western civilization. That said, the project is somewhat more limited than its title suggests, as 6th-5th century Athens doesn't really qualify as the entirety of The Greeks (and without Plato and Aristotle, much less Pythagoras, Thucydides, Herodotus, et al (and etc.), you don't really have the entire 'Crucible of Civilization'). But let's not quibble. After all, it's not even three hours long.",1174694400,,2641,5.1756440281030445

2214964,2,B0007KIFUA,"""A Battle History of Athens"" would have been a better title for this documentary, but as a history of Athens' rise and fall it's marginal at best. It is not a history of the ancient Greeks at all. The emphasis Athens' limited democracy (free, male Athenians) is overly romanticized and Athens' war with Persia (Iran) is characterized as a fight between freedom (democratic Athens) and slavery (autocratic Persia), which Persia started because it couldn't tolerate a city-state such as Athens on its fringes. In fact, the antagonism began when Athens came to the aid of Greek colonists in Asia Minor revolting against Persian rule. Plus, all ancient societies had slaves and Athens could not have prospered as it did without slaves, so to argue that Persia represented slavery while Athens stood for freedom is simply bad faith history.

This documentary also hopes to link Athenian democracy to modern western democracy along some unbroken line of development. There is a connection between the two, but it is not the link that this film implies (in its dramatic final monologue). In fact, Christian Europe (perhaps a truer foundation of the western world), did its best to wipe-out the legacy of Pagan Greece since the early Church fathers considered the Greek writers blasphemous (e.g. the Byzantine emperor Justinian I closed down Plato's Academy in 529 C.E. because he objected to its pagan teachings).

The most serious problem with this film is its treatment of Sparta. Sparta, the other great city-state of the Greek peninsula, and perhaps one of the most intriguing societies of the ancient world, here is reduced to a foil (militaristic oligarchy vs. democracy). To its credit, this film does rightly place responsibility for the Peloponnesian War with Athens. Its treatment of Socrates is also exemplary, and is perhaps the film's one saving grace.",1137283200,,1858,5.128712871287129

2214966,3,B0007KIFUA,"This was an okay overview for those who have had no background in Greek history. To be more precise, this is not a documentary on Greek history but Athenian history.  It presents Athenian history in a very favorable light, one I'm sure that a Greek historian would take issue with. While glorifying Athenian democracy, it does not mention that this democracy was a dictatorship to those surrounding city-states. Sparta is presented in a stereotypical war society with no depth or character and Argos is the only other mentioned city. I can understand that in 165 minutes not every aspect can be covered, but the glorified Athenian view was a little thick.

I also felt this presentation lacked the fullness that it could have had. Taking into consideration that this was made in 2000, it still lacked a depth of digital recreation. It also did not fully exploit dramatic recreation. Instead, it relies upon storytelling while panning to a single shot of a stationary dressed up actor covered in some strange gold-like substance.

2214970,4,B0007KIFUA,"I believe this is the first of the ""Empires"" series on PBS, and as such has a few rough edges that were smoothed out in later productions.  The first weak spot is that it could be better focused in terms of time.  Even though the time frame isn't all that wide, it somehow seems more sprawling than it should be.  And as others have pointed out, it tries to include all of Greece, while in fact staying fairly close to Athens.  I was also less than thrilled with the fact that when discussing one of their selected ""great men"" of Greece, the camera zooms in and holds on an actor standing like a living statue.  And holds.  And sweeps in again.  And holds.  Gets tedious... aren't there other visuals you could use?

2214971,3,B0007KIFUA,"As noted by a number of reviewers, this DVD should have been called ""The Athenians"".  The program suffers from a lack of detail despite its narrow focus.

The program uses shots of (I guess) live models standing stock still, in order to provide some kind of image of various characters from Athenian history who are profiled.  The classical Athenians are portrayed as backstabbing turncoats, but still, the characters come and go for the most part without any kind of before and after history.  Socrates is an exception, but literally everyone knows that story already, so no new ground is covered.

Themistocles, the genius behind Athens' naval victory over the Persians, was ""ostracized"" after his success -- a sign that the ""democracy"" of Athens was really just another fascist oligarchy -- and eventually wound up living in honor among his former enemies, the Persians.  His ostracism is mentioned, but his ultimate fate in the Persian Empire is not.  It would have taken an additional five or ten seconds.

The same can be said about the actions of another estranged Athenian, one who gave Sparta the key to success against Athens.  Perhaps another ten or twenty seconds would have sufficed.

At one point during the war, Sparta sued for peace.  The ""democratic"" government of Athens refused to parley.  And as it imposed more and more tribute on the so-called Delian League, more and more of the tributary towns dumped Athens or even jumped to the Spartan side.

The ""democracy"" existed just long enough to start a major war with a view to a swift victory, then turn down the victory, and even widen the war, suffering a major defeat in the process, and eventually losing everything.

We see almost nothing regarding other Greek cities, even Sparta, the city on which Athens made war.  The pretext for the war arose from something else entirely, and was the result of something Sparta did (as well as its political system), but this is not discussed in the video.

The video ""The Spartans"" [B0000C508X] deals strictly with the Greek city of Sparta, with an entire ""episode"" on the Peloponnesian War.  Despite its focus on a single city, ""The Spartans"" does a better job of giving a real picture of life and politics in classical Greece.  If you get ""The Greeks"", be sure to get ""The Spartans"" in order to see more of the picture, including important details of their struggle with Athens that are omitted from ""The Greeks"".

I do not agree that there was a lot to Sparta.  It wasn't a sophisticated place at all.  Besides the oppressive social structure, the mandatory buggery, the racism / elitism, the eugenics program, the enslavement of its neighbors for centuries, the employment of women as baby machines, and its defeat of Athens, followed by its defeat at the hands of its neighbor, there's little to know about Sparta.  But boy, what an interesting and frightening story.

The Persians dealt piecemeal with the Greeks as much as possible.  That strategy worked in Anatolia and elsewhere.  The Greek city-states managed some major defeats of the Persians alone or by alliances, but on the other hand savaged each other using the Persians either as a pretext (the Delian League) or as an ally (Sparta, in the denouement of the Peloponnesian War).  None of this is explained in the DVD, and again, it wouldn't have added significantly to the length.

""The Greeks"" is a little on the repetitive side, and heavy on irrelevant modern graphics, possibly because it was intended for school aged viewers.  The narrator's voice comes off as a little pompous in my opinion, and the soundtrack is ponderous.  It's worth having around as an introduction to the city of Athens, provided this isn't the only thing in your video library.  Enjoy.",1073347200,,3744,4.878164556962025

After about the fifteenth time the the ship with the large eyes painted on the hull lunged across the screen...sort of a palate cleanser between changes in action...one remarked,  ""this movie doesn't really have an end, does it?""",1072051200,,282,5.130434782608695
2214973,4,B0007KIFUA,"This title is somewhat of a misnomer.  In reality, this film focuses mainly on the city state of Athens, and pays little attention to the rest of Greece.  This is part of the ongoing Empires series of PBS.  In a little less than three hours, this film manages to document the history of Athens from the founding of the citys democracy to the execution of Socrates and the dawn of the philosophical age of Greece.
 This film is very well done, and superbly filmed. It also does an excellent job of detailing the events on which it focuses.  The only complaint I have is that it is too short, and as such is forced to skip large periods in the history.  This creates a number of gaps in the story, which are difficult to fill in if you are not at least modernly familiar with Athens history.  Also, most of the detailed coverage ends with the death of Socrates, with the age of Plato, Aristotle, and the philosophers being only briefly summarized.
 Despite this flaw, this documentary is a good one.  Liam Neeson, who narrates the film, is a perfect fit for the part and does a great job.  And, though the coverage isn't thorough and you will not learn everything there is to know about Greece from this film, PBS does as good a job as one can expect in just three short hours.",1061769600,,1275,4.3872340425531915
2214974,5,B0007KIFUA,"This series does an impressive job of peaking its viewers' interest by integrating an intriguing mixture of sounds and visuals. A strong artistic approach was taken when developing this series as sounds of paradoxically subtle cacophony of everyday Greek life mixes with appropriately composed music serve as a backdrop to Liam Neeson's narrative and the visuals of Greek shores, waters, lands and people.
This series does not cover every aspect of Greek political and social life... nor does it delve into ancient Greek religious beliefs, but what it does do is cover with great clarity the roots of democracy and its influence on Greek society as a whole. It describes how descisions were made when the Persian threat was at its highest, and how the Athenians dealt with the brute military society of the Spartans.
To cover Greek history in great detail requires extensive reading of voluminous academic literature... I don't believe any video series can accomplish this without becoming tens of thousands of hours long and impossibly expensive to the consumer... This series (as most historiographical series do) takes some of the key events and personalities of its chosen history and conveys it intriguingly, thus serving to satiate viewers' curiosity and inspire them to learn more.

2214977,5,B0007KIFUA,"While I agree with the criticisms below that this documentary is more about Athens than Greece, I still rate this as 5 stars. First, it does not entirely ignore other city-states, but gives a decent (not great) treatment of Sparta and Delphi, while mentioning (to a lesser extent) Olympia, Argos, Marathon, Salamis, and myriad other places.

More importantly, however, this documentary's treatment of the most important city-state in Greece (Athens) is magnificent.  The cinematography is beautiful, the narration pleasant, and the material is presented in an intelligent manner. This documentary is nearly three-hours long and packs a punch, always talking up to its listiners and challenging them to understand the full import of a statement without beating you over the head with it.  This is welcome, and all too rare among modern documentaries.

Sure, the documentary could have been more comprehensive, and I was particularly disappointed with its non-treatment of Plato, Aristotle, and Alexander the Great (I would have included them and made it four hours), but hey, I'm still satisfied with what I got.  Likewise, I would have added virtual recreations of the Acropolis, Agora, Delphi, and Olympia.  The rest, however, I would not change. While it was not perfect, it was worth my money and I'll watch this documentary many, many more times to come.

Recommended, but if you're not at all familiar with Greece, you'll appreciate this documentary more after you've read a general introduction to Greece (Edith Hamilton's Echo of Greece and The Greek Way are excellent places to start).

By the way, this documentary comes with four extra scenes, each about 5 minutes long, on the Hoplites, Women, Delphi, and Greek Theatre. Not great, but worth watching.",1015545600,,1762,5.223404255319149

2215000,4,B0007KIFUA,"The Greeks: Cruicible of Civilization is an excellent documentary giving a good basic overview of the Classical Greek Civilization. However, there are certain shortfalls in the video. The narration, visuals, live action sequences, recreations and interviews are all used skillfully to move forward the story in an understandable language. A particularly useful item was the use of three actors playing the parts of Socrates, Themosticles, and Pericles of Athens. These actors do not have any speaking parts; instead they stand while narration moves around them. This allows you to be able to visualize this character, giving life back to someone who could easily be just an old name about a time long ago. I felt that was beautifully done. But it's not perfect. The video seems to focus almost completely on Athens. At the beginning it is stated that Athens was but one of 1000 city-states of Greece; the director seems to forget this point very quickly. Other cities are forgotten and only mentioned when, and if, they come into contact with Athens. This short changes the other cities, such as Thebes, Cornith, Argos, and Sparta which made up and influenced the Greek civilization. There also is almost no mention of the Greek colonies, or the nations that were comtemporary for the time such as the Persians, Egyptians, or Etruscans. Now that said, it can also be understood. If there is one place that is most identifable with influencing what we percieve as civilization, as society, as deomocracy, then it must be Athens. But still the city did not exist in a vacuum, it was part of a larger civilization. I have to say that this is a good, basic introduction to Classical Greece. An excellent way to begin the study of the past.",998956800,,1735,4.904761904761905
2215001,5,B0007KIFUA,"The title of this DVD is not altogether accurate.  If the writers had been interested in choosing a title which had veracity, the DVD would have been called ""Athenians, Crucible of Civilization.""  For it is the Athenians, not the Greeks in general, which this documentary focuses on.  Lacedamon, the other Superpower in Greece, as well as minor city states such as Corinth and Attica, are only mentioned in passing.  Even then, the purpose for speaking of these places is almost always just to point out how they related to Athens.
Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  It is true that Athens was a watershed for western culture with its impressive contributions to political ideology, art, literature, theatre, architecture, philosophy, science, polemic techniques and so much more.  All of these above topics were shunned by the people of Sparta, and the rest of the city states in Greece paled in comparison, insofar as these fields are concerned,  when compared to the grandeur of the ostentatious Athenians.
One place in which this preference for Athens is taken too far, however, is in the treatment of the Persian War.  There were four major battles in this war;  Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis & Plataea.  Only Marathon and Salamis are noted in this work;  Thermopylae and Plataea are not cited at all.  Apparently, the reason for this is that Marathon & Salamis were the two battles where the Athenians faced the Persians alone [at least for the most part;  there were some allied ships sprinkled into the mix @ Salamis].  At Plataea they squared off against the Persians shoulder-to-shoulder with the Spartans and other Greeks.  The Athenians were not involved @ Thermopylae at all.  Persons who are unfamiliar with Greek history would be likely to walk away from this presentation thinking that there were only 2 major battles in the Persian War, and the Athenians deserve all the credit for saving Greece.  That is a skewed understanding of history, and as such, not a good thing.
The biggest oversight of the DVD resides in its chapter on the battle of Marathon.  We are told that after his 140 mile jaunt to Sparta, the messenger Pheidippides' plea for help was refused by the Laconians.  That is very, very, very misleading.  The Lacedamons did NOT intentionally hang their Athenian brethren out to dry in the face of the Persian invasion of Marathon.  Rather, it was due to religious protocal which prevented the Spartan army from setting out right away.  Here is the passage in Herodotus which details the Lacedamons' answer to Pheidippides:
""...the Spartans wished to help the Athenians, but were unable to give them any present succour, as they did not like to break their established law.  It was then the ninth day of the first decade;  and they could not march out of Sparta on the ninth, when the moon had not reached the full.  So they waited for the full of the moon.""  (Herodotus, ""Histories,""  Book VI [Erato], p. 342, trans:  George Rawlinson)
When the Spartans did send their army, they arrived @ Marathon within an astonishing 3 days.  Unfortunately, by then, the fighting was already over & the Athenians had earned a glorious (not to mention improbable) victory.  So, the Laconians congratulated the Athenians and headed home.  The (mostly Ivy league) historians who put this documentary together should have known better than to omit these facts.
By now you're probably thinking that I have nothing but bad stuff to say about this work, right?  Well, no, that's not quite true;  I've said all the negative things I am going to say (after all, I did give it 5 stars, right?).  Now it's time to detail why I loved this DVD so much.
First of all, what the DVD does cover, it covers very well.  The major epochs of Athens are detailed down thru the ages until the end of the Peleponnesian War.  The work goes over such diverse subjects as the role of women in ancient Athens, the tactics and tools of warfare and the paradigms of pottery & architecture.  Also, the lives of such great men as Themosticles, Pericles and Socrates are  scrutinized extensively.  As an added bonus the narrarator is none other than the venerable Liam Neeson, and the score is nearly movie-soundtrack calibre.
Despite my criticisms, I would highly recommend this DVD to all persons who have any interest at all in Greek history and / or the foundations of western thought.",993340800,,4384,4.8492597577388965

It is appropriate to have covered the contributions of Pericles and Themistocles to ancient Athens but what we really admire about ancient Greece isn't the military glory (the Tartars and Attila the Hun could have taught them a thing or two !)___rather it is in the dramas of Sophocles & Euripedes ,in the spiralling mysticism of Plato , the iridescent rationalism of Aristotle and the sublime majesty of Phidias's as manifested on the Parthenon frieze. It is in the intellectual and artistic realm that no civilisation ,before or since, can hold a candle to the ancient Greeks and the glaring deficiency of this documentary lies in giving short shrift to this aspect of the ancient Greek civilisation .I would have given it five stars but for this omission .",980035200,,1460,4.836
