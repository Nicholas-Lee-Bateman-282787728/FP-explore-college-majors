8455239,5,B0053HLZUO,"Im so glad I found Shawn Trautmans DVDs.  I'm on my third DVD of Moves and Patterns, and Im having such a great time learning and practicing all the new moves with my partner.  While the moves may be complicated, Shawn makes them all easy to understand.  If youve been wanting to improve your skills on the dance floor, these are the DVDs for you!  Once youve finished one disc, youll immediately want to move on to the next!  Order the whole set at once  you won't be disappointed!!",1394582400,,483,4.370786516853933
8455240,5,B0053HLZUO,"My favorite part of the Two-Step Moves & Patterns dvds is the Introduction - because that's when you see for the very first time what dance moves are gonna be taught, at full speed, just like you'd see the moves you like for the first time in the country dance halls; it's that type of moment when it hits you just how cool those moves are that you wanna learn!

Starting from the closed position, Shawn & Nicole teach side-by-side (sweetheart) switches, and btw these switches are very helpful for navigating around drunk people on the dance floor.  Along the way, Shawn & Nicole show you other modifications and adjustments for when people are in your way on the dance floor.

Shawn also talks about different kinds of leads (guys pay attention to this); plus rotating side-by-side switches from the cape (sweetheart) position, a.k.a. 'the run around'; and ending with an open release (free turn).  For fun, Shawn adds a couple turns for the ladies into the pattern right before the 'rotating side-by-side switch', thus naming it the 'triple-turn with two 1-hand connections'.  The bonus material teaches you techniques on how to speed up the turns.

You definitely want to watch this DVD at least a couple of times before trying the moves out because the familiarity you get from viewing it more than once really helps cement the moves into your head so they become more natural and memorable... the more you watch it, the easier it becomes.  It's like a learning a new line dance, the more you see it, the more it becomes ingrained into your dance routine.",1370304000,,1560,4.734317343173432
8455241,5,B0053HLZUO,"In Volume 3 of Two-Step Moves and Patterns, changing sides (Switches) with your partner becomes as easy as walking down the line of dance.
Lots of nice turns including a double for the lady that progresses into a third turn where she and her partner combine for a final turn, very impressive.  This accentuates the partners' connection.  This is one of my favorite turns.
My partner really likes the way Shawn explains the hand positions in detail so that each move is executed perfectly.
We are ready for the next Volume.  I love the way they all work together.",1310774400,,562,4.656565656565657
8455242,5,B0053HLZUO,"I have just finished going through the third DVD of this intermediate two-step dance DVD set. This one presents several patterns for the cape position, one of the basic positions in the two-step dance. My favorite is the rotating switch positions pattern. A very sharp looking pattern, but easy to learn. Like the previous DVDs in this set, there are chapters after the pattern lessons for review and practice and a bonus chapter with variations on the pattern lessons presented earlier. I would continue to highly recommend this new DVD set to anyone wanting to improve their Two-Step knowledge.",1309046400,,596,5.03030303030303
