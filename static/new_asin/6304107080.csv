793578,5,6304107080,"The title of my review expresses my obvious bias in regard to the product.  I LOVED The Wind in the Willows when I first saw it as a kid.  The music, the characters, the animation, the visuals make for a simple, wonderous, creative story-telling experience.  It planted some deep truths about life in me, and was always a comfort to watch up until the time the tape got lost during one of several hurricane evacuations during the last several years.  Of course, this is the opinion of just one reviewer, but still, I encourage everyone I can to watch this sometime, see what they can learn from it, what they can enjoy in it.

As to the tape itself, it arrived in excellent condition, wrapped up all nice and neat in a clam-shell jewel case.  My thanks to the seller for helping me reclaim a lost piece of my childhood.",1308009600,,819,4.426666666666667
793579,4,6304107080,"The box and vhs tape were in surprisingly good condition considering it's well over 20 years old! Ah, this cartoon does bring back happy memories of my childhood. I find that I can actually remember some of the lyrics, and that theme song sung by Judy Collins... just beautiful!! There appear to be a few scenes missing early in the cartoon (the bit where Toad tries to convince Mole and Rat to go out in the caravan with him), but the rest is quite quite perfect! Just delighted with this purchase.",1307145600,2,499,4.4945054945054945

7862971,5,6304107080,"I just want to add my voice to the others asking for the 1987 Rankin-Bass ""Wind in the Willows"" to be put on DVD. It's the best adaptation ever of the classic tale.

This was my favorite movie as a kid, and now my kids enjoy it too. Alas, it's a rare find on VHS, especially when sellers confuse it with other animated versions (this Amazon page shows the correct box cover, with an oval graphic over tan background).",1418947200,3,417,4.2784810126582276

7862974,5,6304107080,"I'm 26 right now at the time of this review. I must have been 4 or 5 when I first saw this. My grandparents recorded it for me and my brother when it was on TV so almost every day in kinder they'd pick me up from school, take me to their house, and I'd watch it while eating a snack or something lol.

I found this from another seller here on Amazon some time ago and finally had the time to pop it in.

I cried the second I heard the intro song. It took me back to those times, when life wasn't as complicated and the world just... didn't seem as complicated. Took me back to my grandparents, all the good times.

Anyways, the movie itself.. probably one of the best animated movies I've ever seen, and that's coming from someone who almost never watches animated movies of any kind anymore. The songs are happy, and if you aren't careful, you might just find yourself humming the tune to ""When I'm Messing Around in Boats"" when you're at work... that one's hard to explain, too lol.

They're making a huge mistake, not putting this movie on DVD/Blu-ray. Seems every review of this movie says the same thing, it's a wonder why they don't do it already.

I don't recall the accuracy to this movie in comparison to the book, but it doesn't really seem to matter. This movie is a rare gem, and you should definitely do your best to find a copy on video or online somewhere. Animated movies today just don't come close to the genuine nature of this one.",1366675200,4,1450,4.2773722627737225
7862975,5,6304107080,"This 1987 version is definitely my favorite Wind in the Willows.  There is something very sweet and sincere about it.  The story is well done and the characters are all very endearing.  My favorite part is when Moley gets lost in the dark wood and sadly recalls his home, which he has been away from for so long - it still brings a tear to my eye.
I have bought the VHS tape but I wish they would release it on DVD - I believe kids of any generation could appreciate this.",1323648000,,472,4.108695652173913
7862976,5,6304107080,"The lovely story of ""The Wind in the Willows"" has been animated several times. This is one of my favorites. The cast is well chosen, and even though it diverges from the original a bit, it's still well done.",1320796800,,207,4.333333333333333
