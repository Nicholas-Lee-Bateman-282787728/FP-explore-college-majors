495016,5,630266117X,"The title means maniac's video, which provides fair warning on what this is all about.  It's a film for dedicated anime fans poking fun at the anime sub-culture.  Expect to feel uncomfortable at times, but that's where the true humor lies.
It starts out with a normal college freshman getting involved with an anime club.  His interests gradually shift from ordinary things like playing tennis towards anime, manga, cells, cosplay and garage kits.  Later on he engages on a quest to become King of the Otaku.
Between scenes are ""real life"" interviews with otakus.  It provides a ""Portrait of Otaku"" done in the style of a news magazine doing a show on religious cults.
Numerous links to anime fandom and the industry are presented. For those that are interested there are 22 pages of liner notes at AnimEgo.com with the details.
Overall, this is a one-of-a-kind parody.  Must see for ""dedicated"" anime fans; if for nothing else to serve as a warning shot accross the bow to keep from getting too carried away ^_^",1004832000,8,1012,4.787356321839081
495017,5,630266117X,"I can guarantee you that Otaku no Video will be unlike any other anime movie, series or OAV that you've ever seen.  The fact that it was even brought to the US commercially is rather surprising.  However, given that Animeigo has now reduced the price of the tape... it's a title that every serious anime fan should own.
However, I should warn you: keep a firm grip on your ego when you watch this.  I've never met an anime fan that's seen Otaku no Video and hasn't seen a bit too much of him- or herself in some of the characters.
Otaku no Video is, primarily, three things: a self-parody of and by Gainax, the anime company that brought the world Wings of Honneamise, Evangelion, Nadia and Kareshi Kanojo no Jijyo (for those of you who haven't seen it, Right Stuf will be releasing it soon - don't miss it); a parody (although distressingly true-to-life one at times) of fandom in general and, thirdly, a sort-of history of anime from the early eighties to the early nineties (when it was produced).  The plot can be hard to follow and the references to other (sometimes obscure) anime series fast and furious.  The liner notes don't even claim to get all of the references in there.  However, none of this stops it from being a both fascinating and hilarious - and sometimes painful - look at not only anime but fandom in general.
I can't recommend this series enough.  The only drawback I see is this, though: if you're a big enough fan of anime to know of it, you've probably seen it, and if you're only a casual anime watcher, much of it might be incomprehensible.",976924800,28,1569,4.484210526315789
495018,5,630266117X,This OAV from Gainax is a mocku-mentary of the founding of Gainax itself. The story begins with clean cut college freshmen Kubo. After running into an old friend he soon is drawn into the Otaku culture. He with a little help he wants to otakunize the world. (that would be cool) This tape is a must for any one who has bonded with friends over anime. The animation like with all Gainax title I have is wonderful. Plus character design is by Kenichi Sonda (Gunsmith Cats and the OAV Bubblegum Crisis).,976752000,5,500,4.5054945054945055
7829465,5,630266117X,"Perfect condition. Plays great. A must have for any GAINAX fan!!!  I've watched all of it several times and loaned it to friends several times.
Most people don't even know about this. But as an longtime true anime fan, with Evangelion being my #1 favourite, I'm glad I found it.  My ex taped over the VHS of many of my classic anime copied from original Japanese Laser Disc. For fracking OPRAH!!! :((

And note that I said ex... lol",1489363200,2,432,4.443037974683544

7829467,1,630266117X,I have sadly seen a trend recently that descriptions of many anime titles SAY they have english as a language (english dub) only to find out that this has been wrong SO many times its not funny anymore its costing money and time (which is more money as we all know) I've bought MANY MANY videos from you Amazon it thinks its time to step it up a notch and DESIGNATE someone to check these title a little more thoroughly PLEASE!!!!,1391558400,2,430,4.320987654320987
7829468,3,630266117X,"I bought this after reading about it somewhere, and as an anime fan I could appreciate the charm, but ultimately it wasn't all that interesting. I honestly can't recommend buying it, if you can find it to watch online give it a look but I can't recommend a purchase.",1378771200,,266,4.448979591836735
7829469,4,630266117X,"I found this a good DVD but with a very dark message in it. Although it was made in the 1991, it shows how people who allow their fantasies to overtake their real lives, are doomed to miss out on making real friends, having happy personal relationships, good careers or a happy home life. It was sad the losers they showed who had lost everything in their quest to live in the fantasy world and not the real world. Only one person they showed was able to break free and resume a normal, productive life with a good chance of being happy. The message seems to be that the longer you chase you anime dreams, the less likely you'll ever realize your real dreams. I believe that the 1989 crash of the Japanese economic miracle feed into people's hopelessness in Japan and they wanted to escape from reality. The seems can be said of those Internet Trolls today who stay glued to their machines and are afraid to go out into the real world. I would recommend this DVD as a good warning about those dangers.",1371600000,3,1001,4.387096774193548
7829470,5,630266117X,A must watch for any Otaku. I'm actually kinda surprised that more folks don't know about this OVA. An absolute joy to watch.,1368057600,,125,4.478260869565218
7829471,5,630266117X,"The story is easy to explain.  It is the history of a fictional group of people who are fans of anime and manga.  It is their struggle to make their love work for them, to start a business for fun and profit, fail, but try again till they win.
But the story is full of information only fans of anime and manga would understand.  Mecha, cosplay, anime, manga, greed, romance, Robotech, science fiction, fantasy, sexy girls, money and the future of mankind itself!  Live action scenes and an insert with tons of data.
GET THIS DVD!  You will LOVE it!  Frankly, it was about time I bought and watched it.",1201737600,,601,4.418181818181818
7829472,5,630266117X,"Excellent anime video! Otaku no video is a production which gives a background into the anime world and those who are obsessed with it (known as Otaku) The video has both interviews with anime fans and an anime storyline going on at the same time. Very original writing and production and well worth watching.

This video originally released on video tape is available on DVD now and complements the book ""Anime Essentials"" which has a similar cover.

I highly recomend picking both the video and book up if you are interested in the world of Japanese anime and manga.",1124755200,3,568,4.7272727272727275
7829473,5,630266117X,"For any nominally serious fan looking to know more about the culture behind classic anime,  for die-hard Gainax fans or for psych/sociology majors researching the escapist motivations evinced by inhabitants of Sci-Fi fandom, this is absolutely required material. It's also one of my favorite discs.
A fictionalized account of how the key individuals at animation studio Gainax (Neon Genesis, FLCL) got into the business, Otaku No Video (graffiti of otaku generation) is one of a kind. Originally released in two parts in 1982 and 1985, this OVA follows ""city boy"" Kubo in his trek from tennis-playing college kid to becoming a revered cult figure in the world of Japanese animation. Leaving a college drinking spree early one evening (I've got a match in the morning) Kubo runs into old high school pal Tanaka and his posse of anime-manga-sci-fi junkies. Nerdsville incarnate. Kubo is quickly drawn into their world of geek fandom, losing his cute upper middle class girlfriend Ueno and abandoning college to begin marketing garage kits with Tanaka. Their upstart business brings them to the brink of garage kit kingdom , only to suffer a hostile takeover by a heartless corporate parasite and his vengeful new wife, Kubo's old flame Ueno!
Tanaka is sacked and Kubo loses position as president of the company, demoted to a remote outpost as a shamed middle-manager. But Fate strikes again. He runs into the shamed Tanaka on the street one day and they once again launch into a start-up, this time Garage Animes,  rising to claim the throne of OtaKings!
The film is interspersed with several live-action, mockumentary-style ""interviews"" with various types of popular media fans, such as, a former cos-player, an anime collector,a  cel thief and a garage kit builder. Through these ""interviews"", we see the culture of fans who attend Comic Market, produce their own fanzines, or live in the childish world of cartoon computer porn and paintball combat. They reminisce and rationalize, to great effect.
Otaku No Video is loaded with insider cultural references. AnimEigo includes in the disc liner notes that explain all the references, a BIG help to those looking to piece together Japanese subculture.
This is a fun, informative, sometimes even moving film that true fans of anime culture will watch repeatedly. You'll never look at anime the same way again after this.",1076025600,15,2368,5.129533678756476
7829474,5,630266117X,"""Otaku"" in Japanese means ""honorable house,"" and is used as a derogatory slang term for anyone so into their hobby that they never leave their house.  Devout hobbyist that the Japanese are, you will find many otakus, laden with cameras and photo gear, or comic books and anime cels.
""Otaku no Video"" (Otaku's Video) is a mockumentary showing the slow descent into otaku-hood of Kubo, a young college student with a girlfriend and a scant interest in anime/manga.  Through the bad influence of an old friend, Tanaka, his interest gains control of his life, and he is soon a full-blown otaku, indulging in CosPlay and abandoned by girlfriend and society.  Finding himself on rock-bottom, he vows to become the Ota-king, and create a theme park where all otakus can find respect pursuing their anime interests.
Interspersed with this animated storyline are live action interviews with ""real"" otakus, showing their dismal lives and asking questions like ""So, did you ever think about having sex with a real girl?""  This may hit a little too close to home for some otakus!
The DVD is a hilarious self-parody of anime otakus by anime otakus, and includes a thinly disguised history of animation studio Gainax.  The in-jokes come fast and furious, and you would need to be a true otaku to catch them all.
""Otaku no Video"" is quite dated, and many of the references will be lost on newer anime/manga fans.  However, it makes for good viewing and both the animated storyline and the interviews are hilarious.  A must see.",1070323200,12,1512,4.8599221789883265
