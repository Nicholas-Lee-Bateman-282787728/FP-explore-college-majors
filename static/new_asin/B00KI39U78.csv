8659148,5,B00KI39U78,The music selection and the scenario arrangements were absolutely astonishing. However the best part of the concert was choosing an string quintet to perform in parallel with the band. What a beautiful combination!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Perhaps her best performance yet. .,1410566400,,299,6.6923076923076925
