6161466,3,B00HF95O6E,"This movie is not good.  It is not bad, either.  Some of the performances ALMOST carry it.  Rufus Sewell is nuanced and great (as always).  Gabriel Byrne gives a solid, masterful performance. Terence Maynard is really fabulous. And then we come to Toby Stephens.  Whether he was not up to the task or the writer/director George Isaac was lacking - it's hard to tell.  I tend to think it was a combination of the two. Toby Stephens acted in a range that ran the gamut (as Dorothy Parker has said) from A to B.  Not a chuckle in a carload.  Not an ounce of humor.  Not a bit of emotion. Ever. His acting had all the earmarks of someone who has just smelled something very nasty, but keeps that to himself. And all of that just about sank the movie.  The other actors - journeymen all - were up to the task.  Not Stephens. It was as though Isaac kept saying ""for God's sake don't smile!"" and ""No, we'll have to do it again - I think I saw you have a thought..."" and Stephens was just along for the ride. Too bad. Good thing the other actors didn't listen...",1395532800,6,1054,4.22

6161468,2,B00HF95O6E,"I didn't finish watching this because the characters seemed to be going through the motions of a complex scenario without any sense of reality. The producers of this film didn't make enough of an effort to get me to care about what was happening,",1393545600,2,246,4.613636363636363

6161470,5,B00HF95O6E,"When a crime kingpin makes a ""deal"" with the cops (some of whom aren't the best people), there's no end to what these guys will do to get ahead and eliminate each other! Gabriel Byrne delivers a top-notch, though understated acting job and the rest of the cast makes this film one not to miss! Lots of action and mystery as to exactly who are the bad guys and who are the heroes.",1391472000,5,379,4.205479452054795

8632328,1,B00HF95O6E,"I agree and disagree with much of what was said. It was a bit convoluted. The main point I want to make is simply that this movie has a different title in the UK. That being, ""A Deadly Game""",1411776000,,190,3.8974358974358974

8632330,1,B00HF95O6E,"My husband and I have seen hundreds of police procedural movies and series's in English as well as Nordic, South American, etc.  Generally, we will find something to like.  I watched the entire thing, and never understood the plot except that the police were corrupt and a mobster's son was somehow involved.  The script was simply nonsensical.",1399766400,,344,5.0
8632331,3,B00HF95O6E,"We are in London, looking at the big time, as Rufus Sewell who plays Parker, a Scotland Yard detective who is looking to fill his retirement till by looking into a cocaine case. We see him as he follies and catches a cocaine dealer, Mark Corso, played by Pierre Mascolo.  Arrested and placed in jail, Parker then goes after Parker Corso's  father,  a big time crime boss,Joseph, played by Gabriel Byrne. In return for letting his son go, Parker wants Corso Sr to do him a favour by hiring another thief, Riley, played by Toby Stephens. This is a convoluted story of double cross by threes, and is very confusing.

The storyline leaves a lot to be desired, but the screen shots of London, the insides and outsides of the city are well worth a look. The film, no. No idea what Gabriel Byrne was thinking, did he do this for the money?

Not Recommended For Me.  prisrob 05-03-14",1399075200,3,875,4.471698113207547
8632332,2,B00HF95O6E,I like British movies and especially those made in London.  But this mess.  Good acting talent wasted on a convoluted and nonsensical plot.  Save your time and money and don't watch this turkey.,1397692800,2,194,4.818181818181818
8632333,1,B00HF95O6E,"This was a terrible movie. A complete waste of money. Way too complicated, no way to understand what was going on or why. This movie simply made no sense. Don't waste your money!",1397520000,,178,4.424242424242424
8632334,3,B00HF95O6E,"Story in London about a policeman and his two partners who capture a drug dealer.  They go to his dad who is a merchant of many things.  The Police want to get another guy so the dad is goaded into getting him. A heist is arranged and the viewer is treated to a London based car chase that ends with a shooting.

Big convoluted mess that had me thinking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sting/dp/B000ICXQXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sting</a>, unfortunately none of the characters in this are very interesting. Swearing, no bare skin. The British accent is at times difficult to understand, I aspired for Closed Captions but it did not work. Big shoot out at the end. Pass on this one.",1397433600,,739,5.299145299145299
8632335,1,B00HF95O6E,"It only took a few minutes to see how bad this one was going to be.
First, no subtitles and for anyone outside England - good luck getting most (even some) of what was said. Aussies, Canadians, Irish - again, good luck. Add the poor audio levels and even poor enunciation by London standards and it was torturous.
Second, no special features. A good sign of cheap.
Third, a whole bunch of pointless scenes in those opening minutes and found in countless crime movies, e.g. our main crook is in a hotel bedroom checking which, out of an arsenal of handguns, to buy. His test is to hold each gun outstretched and look down the barrel sight. Dumb! Then he meets with some guy and his girl with the camera focused on the girls crossed, under the table, legs. Dumb! Then he steals diamonds as easily as grocery shopping. Then he pours gasoline on his getaway car to burn the evidence. Tediously dumb! We get the usual burial scene with a hot chick dressed all in black with the usual sunglasses and off in the distance is the mysterious solitary figure watching the whole funeral. Pleease! The diamond exchange site is the usual garage loaded with expensive cars as the backdrop. How imaginative! Guy and girl in bed, about to do something, and guess what? Phone rings, time to go to work.
Fourth, robotic acting, dialogue and not believable ending. A made for TV crime formula vibe. Not creative, imaginatively written, acted, filmed or directed.",1397088000,3,1442,4.658823529411765
