This is a compilation of independent horror shorts featured at the festivals.

Plasticity 1.7- after losing her legs in a car-wreck, a chick takes revenge on the other driver by making him into a machine.

Cup-O-Abomonations- an animated short portraying part of the Book of Revelation.

Entrapped- a dude gets locked up and tortured for screwing a cop's wife.

Non-Abductees Anonymous- abductee-challenged individuals form a support group to cope with grief of not being taken by aliens.

Slasher Flick- while watching a horror marathon at work, a dude is stalked by a knife-wielding killer.

Tomorrow's Bacon- a fighting couple stop at a diner and when they leave, there's a knife missing.

Subway- a chick misses her train and is attacked by a stranger, but who (or what) has the last say?

Scream For Me- a guy strangles a stripper, but a heartbroken fan of hers busts in and gets his revenge.

Stand out features are:
Slasher Flick, it's great when you can poke fun at your own movie, Subway is in the vein of Species, and Scream For Me I'd seen at a convention last year, and it left lasting images in my head, definitely worth a watch if you can stomach the ending.

This is one of the better horror compilations I've seen. If you're interested in more work by Christopher Alan Broadstone, check out his DVD, 3 Dead Girls, which has Scream For Me, My Skin, and Human No More, or you can pick up Visions of Horror here on Amazon for under 10 bucks and get 2 out of the 3.
