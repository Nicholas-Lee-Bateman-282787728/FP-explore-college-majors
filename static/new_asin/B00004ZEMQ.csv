7928439,3,B00004ZEMQ,"It is not the best DVD I have. It is not one the best 10 either. If you find it in sale, and you want to increase your collection or you like at least one of the singers (like Harry Connick Jr, in my case), give it a try.",1364860800,,221,3.5306122448979593
7928440,4,B00004ZEMQ,"I really enjoyed the variety of this DVD! The quality of the editing and engineering was top notch. Many great performances by classic entertainers. The only improvement in MY opinion would be to remove the JEFF BUCKLEY track. Not only because I dislike that style of music, but it just didn't fit the genre of music presented. Enjoy!
If you like Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer, & Mark O'Connor's song on this DVD you really HAVE to check out their whole DVD ""Appalachian Journey"" it's unbeleivable! - Amazon sells this one, too :>)",1066953600,,523,4.695652173913044
7928441,4,B00004ZEMQ,"There a wide, make that VERY wide variety of musical styles represented here.  It's a great way to sample over a dozen music DVDs to see if they fit what you like to watch.  I was surprised how much I liked the touching ""Annie's Song,"" and how subdued Tony Bennett seemed on ""Moonglow.""  Anyway, it's a fun starter DVD, and the price is right.",1018224000,2,343,4.328125
7928442,2,B00004ZEMQ,"It's hard to quibble with this DVD at this low price but I will anyway.  Overall it was disappointing.  About half of the performances were lackluster at best and the sound quality on some (remember this is a showpiece for the medium) were underwhelming.  I was particularly surprised at the distracting camera work on Billy Joel's number.  I love everything Billy Joel but seeing him 'attacked' by multiple cameras was too much.  The performances and audio from Stevie Ray Vaughn, Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Tony Bennett were the better numbers.  The overall best was Yo-Yo Ma's ""1B"".  I have none of his music in my  large CD collection but this piece was a visual and sonic standout.
  If Sony wants to impress with DVD technology, I think they could do a lot better than this.  Quibble, quibble.",1000080000,13,813,4.776978417266187
7928443,4,B00004ZEMQ,"This DVD is excellent value for the price you pay.  The pop and easy listening songs, and the majority of the DVD is this type, are all excellent.  The rock songs aren't as good but they are watchable.  This DVD is a good lead up to a movie or a family evening.  If you like Irish music, Charlotte Church's, ""Danny Boy"" is superior and it alone would make this DVD one that you will play for years to come.",986601600,6,406,4.10126582278481
7928444,5,B00004ZEMQ,"There are two reasons that I bought this DVD. First, it is cheaper than Korea where I live. They are selling the same title at the price corresponding to 19$ in Korea! The next and more important reason is that it might offer me different experiences from various musicians in a single DVD. In fact, I hadn't even heard of a few musicians appeared in this DVD. I chose this just because I wanted to enjoy some familiar songs played by musicians of my taste. But after I have seen it again and again, I came to like almost all of songs. I prefer appreciating music performances in DVD to listening to music only on CD. I believe good sound and nice view of this DVD would give you the same feeling I've had. If you can't afford to attend such performances, buy this one instead. It deserves to be the first collection of your music concert DVDs.",983923200,4,844,4.348101265822785
