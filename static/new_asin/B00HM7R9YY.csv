8633442,1,B00HM7R9YY,The film is okay and definitely worth preserving. I don't have high standards and enjoy lots of silents and serials that have not been digitally remastered. But the quality of the image on this one is much poorer than the reviews led me to hope. The soundtrack is a series of short silent-era compositions that are added without any effort to connect them to the image. Watching this may duplicate the experience of viewers at some theaters in 1926 but still The reviewers let me down on this one.,1423526400,3,497,4.595505617977528

8633444,5,B00HM7R9YY,Wonderful Silent film - staring Raymond Glenn and Strongheart - a German Shepherd.  I truly wish that they had made a series of these.  At some point I'll get the Chester Norris version - which I enjoyed as a kid.  Highly recommend for fans of Boston Blackie.,1417910400,2,259,4.468085106382978
8633445,2,B00HM7R9YY,"This film, The Return of Boston Blackie, appears to be the only surviving film to feature Strongheart. Having read about Strongheart and Rin-Tin-Tin in Susan Orlean's book on Rin-Tin-Tin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rin-Tin-Tin-The-Life-and-the-Legend/dp/1439190135/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend</a>), I was curious to see Strongheart and purchased this film. I can say that it's not a complete waste of time. Strongheart was a beautiful and clever dog, and his film persona includes a lot more humor than I expected (there's a whole sub-plot about his stealing hot dogs from a hot dog stand in his neighborhood and the futile attempts to stop him). Strongheart was very athletic. The film is fairly stilted in the manner of the time, but still entertaining. Of course, Strongheart saves the day! The plot is wildly improbable, but Strongheart is really not inferior as entertainment to Rin-Tin-Tin. I give it only two stars because it is hopelessly dated, but people who really like dogs and are interested in Strongheart could easily rate it higher, including me.",1338854400,7,1141,5.6395348837209305
8633446,4,B00HM7R9YY,"The character of Boston Blackie has been featured in a number of films. I do not think this one has any connection to the earlier or later Boston Blackie films. The story is unremarkable in itself, a former con trying to go straight but getting himself in trouble anyways. The real attraction here is Strongheart the german shepard who gets star billing! Mostly forgotten today, Strongheart was a star in the 1920s and a rival of Rin Tin Tin. Stronghearts was making movies before Rinty, but this is the only one known to exist. Strongheart is a beautiful dog though and photographs better than Rin Tin Tin, due to being a blonde. There is a scene on a ride at an amusement park that I believe is Coney Island. I am fairly certain that is the Cyclone Roller Coaster in the background. There is alot to like here though the film itself is not as thrilling as it probably was way back when.",1332115200,12,888,4.45398773006135
