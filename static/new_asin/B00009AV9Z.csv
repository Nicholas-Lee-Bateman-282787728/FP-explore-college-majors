1882687,4,B00009AV9Z,"While children and collectors will love this 4 episode set, I have to say that it's a little rough for adults to endure in the day and age of Justice League of America and Justice League Unlimited.  The plots and concepts of Superfriends are much better suited for younger fans however, and certainly had no toruble holding their interest.",1138838400,7,339,4.745762711864407
1882688,4,B00009AV9Z,"The episode is good... but I really want Warner to release the whole series in a ""TV on DVD"" format... just like what's happening with Spider-Man -- one series at a time.  There's something about classic animation -- 1966-1974 or so... no cartoons/animations evoke the same kind of feelings...",1082592000,5,293,4.979591836734694
1882693,5,B00009AV9Z,"I used to wake up early as a child back in the 70s just to catch this show! This DVD has the Superfriends vs, classic villains such as Lex Luthor, Scarecrow, Bizarro and many more. No teenaged sidekicks on this disc :)",1431043200,3,218,4.214285714285714
1882694,4,B00009AV9Z,"You get 4 episodes with this DVD set:

1.  Trial of the Super Friends
2.  Monolith of Evil
3.  The Giants of Doom
4.  Secret Origins of the Super Friends

If you have already purchased ""Challenge of the Super Friends The 1st Season"" on DVD you do not need to buy this DVD because these episodes are on that disc.  It is actually cheaper to buy ""Challenge of the Super Friends The 1st Season"" than the 4-episode collections which are on 3 separate DVDs.",1419897600,10,452,4.309523809523809

1882698,5,B00009AV9Z,"So the boy is getting into the whole idea of super heroes (he's nearly 4) and trying to understand what constitutes the difference between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"".  For a three-year old, the current permutation of Justice League cartoons (the Cartoon Network series) is too much - simply too violent and doesn't have easily digestible moral vehicles.

But these campy '70s iterations of SuperFriends/Justice League (aside from the politically incorrect Apache Chief inserts) are easy to follow (Legion of Doom = bad guys) and easy to understand the differences between right and wrong.  And just like a fortune cookie, there's always some generically applicable moral at the end.",1271203200,8,682,5.238532110091743

1882700,3,B00009AV9Z,"It's great because the episodes featured
do show all of the arch-nemisis and heroes
but it's a really tiny collection which runs
entirely too quickly to enjoy the DVD.",1254182400,,167,4.793103448275862
1882701,5,B00009AV9Z,"Being an avid comic book reader as a kid,I could not help but love super hero related cartoons. The story lines were simple and it was something every child growing up could relate. Too bad so many of today's Saturday morning t.v is not as fun.",1253491200,2,244,4.326086956521739
