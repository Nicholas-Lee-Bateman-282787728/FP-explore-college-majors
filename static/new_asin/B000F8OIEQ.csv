2554907,5,B000F8OIEQ,"I can remember seeing Henry Cho fifteen years ago on Comedy Central and he was squeaky clean. He had a great attention getter

with his accent. Its hard to beleive we can get clean material today with what we see and hear on TV and he does just that.

Henry should get plenty dates for corporate and convention meetings.

2554908,5,B000F8OIEQ,"I first saw this on Comedy Central and HAD to have it.  Henry an American of Korean decent who was born and raised in Knoxville, TN.  According to him, this makes him, ""South Korean.""  He uses no bad words (and only one that may be debatable) or crude subject matter.  I enjoyed his humor, mainly about being the only Asian kid and being married, and think his comic timing is outstanding.  I recommend the DVD and Henry Cho highly - ""Bless His Heart.""",1155513600,16,452,4.397590361445783
2554909,4,B000F8OIEQ,"I first saw Henry Cho on a dvd with other country comedians and it was hilarious.  He tells stories about being a Korean farmer living in Tennessee (I'm a big hit at the co-op).  He talks about his friends, like how Jonly Bonly Stuart got his name (his parents were dumb and he's as smart as a bag of hammers).  He's fun to watch and to listen to.  If you have never caught his act, do so soon.",1151539200,7,394,4.012820512820513
2554930,5,B000F8OIEQ,love clean comedians there is not enough of them out there Henry Cho is hillarious and we need more comedians like him,1378166400,,118,4.409090909090909
2554931,5,B000F8OIEQ,This product is worth the money you pay. Henry is a funny man. Can make the right gift for anyone. You can't go wrong buying this product. Its a nice product to buy as a gift for someone special or for myself. The DVD came in great shape.,1372636800,,238,3.9791666666666665
2554932,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Loved the product, price was a steal had to return nothing. Packing was great and price was too. will order more soon. Thanks",1357084800,,125,4.478260869565218
2554933,3,B000F8OIEQ,"Watched with my children. No big laughs here, just some chuckles. We absolutely love comedy.  (Tim Hawkins and Brian Regan are our favs). Completely agreed with ""Rizzo's"" review. Felt exactly the same about lack of energy and sooo slow and using halting lame fillers to segue between each monologue topic unlike most comedians who know how to do it seemlessly. Also, beware Henry mentions a story about his dad ordering a ""quickie"" (meant quiche) at a restaurant. I'm cringing waiting for the ""mom, what's a quickie??""  Thankfully it just went over their heads, but yours may be more inquisitive so be warned.. It really is clean other than that reference and the use of the word Pis--d if that's offensive.",1342742400,,707,4.883333333333334
2554934,4,B000F8OIEQ,"Henry Cho preformance was amazing and he is a great comedian with good material.  I just wish the show was longer then it was with only one hour.  What made me buy the dvd was his bit on Arab Alabama, What's that clickin Noise, and when he says that college is the only time in your life you can write a check for 50 cent and it bounces and his father says to him ""You don't have two quarters.""  That for me made the show priceless.  So if you enjoy a good clean funny comedian then pick this guy up and enjoy a wonderful humorous show start to finish and great for the whole family.",1338768000,,583,4.043478260869565
2554935,3,B000F8OIEQ,"My mom and I were all about Henry Cho when we first discovered his special on tv one year, so my mom bought the cd version of it. Over the years, her cd has been lost so I purchased this as a replacement for her. She was thoroughly delighted when I surprised her with it during my last visit and we popped it right in the dvd player. I'm not sure if they edited the pauses in between punch-lines on the cd or not, but I swear, while some of his content is very funny, I'd estimate that 15 minutes or more of this show is him on stage looking out at the audience...in silence. I guess to make the punch-line more effective? This is just moves WAY more slowly than I remember it, but then again it has been awhile. Anywhoo, 5 stars for the seller, 3 for the content of the product (which is outside the seller's control).",1329523200,,819,4.125
2554936,4,B000F8OIEQ,"This is a good almost hour long stand up dvd, Henry Cho is funny and has quite a few jokes that make you laugh. However I don't think it should be 13$ or w/e. I think buying it in a movie stop or Hastings used would suffice. Only problem with that is, it doesnt seem to be very common anywhere but online. But I would recommend to watch.",1325289600,,337,3.9705882352941178
2554937,5,B000F8OIEQ,"We like Henry Cho, clean comedy and funny!  He has a good outlook on life and marriage.  A welcome change compared to the foul language used in comedy today.",1298419200,,157,4.379310344827586
2554938,5,B000F8OIEQ,This is a very good DVD. Love Henry Cho. He is very funny and not a DVD that you don't mind sitting and watching with your parents in the room. This is very clean and that is one of the things I like about it. He has much personality. Just wish he had more DVDs out there.,1298332800,,272,3.789473684210526
2554939,3,B000F8OIEQ,Henry Cho would concentrate more on the humor of growing up as a Korean in the South. I felt he tried to hard to just be a southern boy - while ignoring the huge treasure trove of humor that is his background.  His funniest lines (except for Jonely Bonely) were about his family; I wanted to hear more about them.,1293753600,,313,4.216666666666667
2554950,5,B000F8OIEQ,This item arrived quickly and in perfect shape. I gave it as a gift and the person I gave it to just loved it!,1293580800,,110,3.625
2554951,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Mr. Cho is wonderful. His humor is laid back and clean. My mom, who hates foul language, loved him. Parents can watch him with their kids and not be embarrassed by subject matter or language. Overall one of my favorite comedians. Compared to the BCCT boys his subject matter is cleaner than any of them and he is much more laid back-this doesn't take anything away from his performance though.",1289088000,,393,4.628571428571429
2554952,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Roll-on-the-floor-laughing funny.  Safe for work, safe for family.  SO refreshing!  I live out West and found the Asian-kid-raised-in-the-South portions absolutely hysterical, even though I've never been to Arab, Alabama.  There's a little something here for everybody, regardless of where you're from or what your background is.  This was a phenomenal breath of fresh air.  I've owned it for over a year, ripped it to my iPod, and still crack up when I'm listening to it.  I wish more Henry Cho titles were available.",1283212800,,518,5.168674698795181
2554953,5,B000F8OIEQ,"When I only got to catch 10 minutes of his act on comedy central I though, ""Oh I have to get this and see what he's all about.""  The man is hilarious.",1280966400,,150,3.6875
2554954,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Well just to keep it short this is one of the most hilarious comedy acts I have seen in a long time.  The fact that it is clean enough to play for any group just adds to the appeal of it.  Henry Cho is a Korean who is born and raised in Tennessee and it gives him a ton of material to write about and relate to (including his wife from Arab Alabama).  Anyone who does not get a ton of laughs from this needs therapy.  Get this DVD and enjoy it, if you are from the South you will enjoy it all the more.",1234915200,,502,3.7523809523809524
2554955,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Very clean humor, such a rarity these days. Is a great choice for a good laugh. The entire family has a good time watching Henry. Now, if he will only come to town so we can see him Live!",1220313600,,187,3.8205128205128207
2554956,3,B000F8OIEQ,The DVD of Henry Cho was as good as I thought it would be. I would recommend  it!,1202169600,,81,3.5
2554957,3,B000F8OIEQ,"I have to admit, there's nothing else in this special that's as funny as the one joke I remembered (J only, B only), but it's a pretty entertaining DVD nonetheless.",1200614400,,164,4.5
2554958,5,B000F8OIEQ,"I think Henry Cho has been over looked and under rated. I saw him several years ago on a late night talk show and thought he was great. Then I didn't hear any more about him. While channel surfing cable one night, I stumbled upon this performance. I've never forgotten ""jonly bonly"". I am from a small town in Kentucky and I swear I know this guy. You have to be from the south or familiar with red-neck life style to really appreciate this guy. He is so original, and his comedy is so honest. I'm sure a lot of his humor comes from real life experiences, 'cause like he says, you can't make this stuff up. Keep on keepin' on Mr. Cho, and bring us more of your specialty. America needs more laughter, and by the way the way this guy is squeaky clean, no smut needed.",1191974400,2,766,4.1824324324324325
2554959,3,B000F8OIEQ,"I have enjoyed Henry Cho at his best, I mean real ""funny"".  This dvd ""What's That Clickin' Noise"" is not that good.  He often tells the audience that something is funny, no hearty laughs with this one. Sort of left us ""ho hum"".",1182124800,,227,4.255813953488372
2554970,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Henry Cho is as good as the ""Blue Collar Comedy"" guys.  You would never believe he is Korean if you didn't see him.  He is also clean, no vulgarity at all.  Children can listen to this performance.",1173312000,9,197,4.27027027027027
2554971,4,B000F8OIEQ,"We thought this comic was so funny we bought four more for our children.  His humor is clean and we thought the jokes about Arab, Alabama were hilarious.  We have visited Arab since our son lives there and what Henry Cho says about it is true.",1170720000,7,243,4.260869565217392
2554972,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Henry Cho was someone I caught on the Comedy channel.. saw the last part of his routine and was laughing my head off. I looked and looked to see when he was going to be on the Channel again and could find him... So I had to get his DVD. It is hysterical!! The whole family can enjoy his humor.  His unique view of the world... the Southern world from a Korean man's perspective is refreshing. But, mostly, you can relate to his outlook on life or at least find it very funny.  I only wish it would have gone on for hours...and hours.",1169683200,,533,4.115384615384615
2554973,4,B000F8OIEQ,"Henry Cho is a very funny storyteller and frequently remarks that he gets much of his material simply by relating his experiences with family and friends.  Raised in the only Asian family in a southern town, Henry's stories show the funny side of our cultural differences and our similarities.  His show is family friendly: there is no profanity, not even any risque stories.  The entire family can sit and enjoy this together.",1168473600,2,427,4.902777777777778
2554974,5,B000F8OIEQ,"Finally a comedian you can watch with your kids!! Henry Cho is funny and a breath of fresh air with his stories and jokes. This is clean comedy at it's best. I didn't think I'd ever get to watch another comedian again the way they all use such foul langauage and X-rated descriptions of their stories. I hope other comedians get the message a clean up their acts! Thank you Henry Cho for a great d.v.d. Looking forward to your next one. Sweetwater, TN",1164585600,3,451,4.380952380952381
2554975,4,B000F8OIEQ,"It was so pleasurable to be able to view this video without worry about sex, violence, vulgar language or displays of nudity.  I wish there were more like it.",1163116800,,158,4.448275862068965
2554976,5,B000F8OIEQ,"You want comedy you can watch as a family? Well, Henry Cho is it. He really speaks truths about life and everyone can relate to his stories. Even if you like raunchier comedy, try him out. He's pretty dang funny and you just might like it, like it!",1156550400,,248,4.1875
2554977,5,B000F8OIEQ,"I think Henry Cho is the best! It's so nice to be able to sit down with your whole family, kids and grandkids included, and laugh with a comedian like this! His stories are real life and that makes them great. I would love to have more entertainment like this.",1156464000,,260,4.22
2554978,3,B000F8OIEQ,"I laughed throughout watching this entire DVD. Although his humor doesn't strike me as hilariously funny as some of my favorite comedians (Dane Cook, Jim Gaffigan, Brian Regan, & Ellen Degeneres), he's very funny & I don't regret the purchase at all.",1155945600,2,250,4.976190476190476
2554979,5,B000F8OIEQ,"I watched Henry Cho on TV almost 20 years ago and thought he was the funniest comedian.  I have since not seen him on TV but use his routine and ""clean"" content as a standard when comparing other comedians today (Jim Gaffigan is similar). I have been recommending this DVD to many friends and family members.  Henry Cho's timing (and southern drawl) reflects his laid back approach to humor.  The show for this DVD was filmed in his hometown, and many people in the audience knew him.  The DVD contains a track in the bonus features with a little footage of an after-the-show Q&A that Henry Cho had with the audience -- he has a quick wit and seems to be a genuinely nice guy!",1155859200,,676,4.384
