4698749,5,B005GYXNO0,"I purchased Daily Energy last year and was excited to see More Daily Energy coming out.  For me I really like Shiva Rea in most of her dvds, but some tend too be a little to flowy and dancey for me.  I find these daily energy dvds to be right up my alley.  The best part I think is having 7 20 minute practices that I can do in preset sequences or I can make my own from the matrix.  I have done both, but when I am in a hurry, it is nice to just be able to fit in what I have time for or work on a specific area.

Overall, I was very pleased with this dvd.  I like the mix between the lunar practice and the solar practice, with the solar being more energizing and the lunar bringing me a needed stretch at the end of the day.  I felt when I did the lunar portion that I had just wrung out a washcloth full of stress.  My spine felt wonderful, I felt I had been able to breathe deep into my practice and really dissolve the stress. I LOVE the 7 minute long shivasana segment-so very relaxing!

The music is soft, instrumental and it didn't bother me, I feel like I don't really want to concentrate on the music much-it shouldn't really be my focal point, just a nice background and that is what it was.  The set is simple, she is working out on a round wooden platform surrounded with gold silky fabric and some columns.  I found it to be beautiful in a simplistic way.  Again, I don't need to be dazzled with a beautiful beach to enjoy my workout.

I would say this work out is for intermediate to advanced (some of the moves at the end of the solar practices had me just staring....how the heck.......?)  Besides those and a few impossible balance postures (for me at least), I felt I could follow along nicely and move along at my own pace.

I enjoy this dvd as much as I did the initial dvd and very much enjoy the set practice and yoga-matrix format.",1327104000,2,1856,4.074380165289257
4698750,4,B005GYXNO0,"I own a couple of Shiva Rea's Yoga videos and the matrix rocks!  I don't know of any others that let you create your own session by choosing specific sets.  I had a chance to meet her in person recently at her Inner Fire workshop and it was a great experience.  She is so down to earth and has a way of connecting with people on an individual basis that is beyond description.  No words could do justice.

This video helps to create a space for personal growth.  Now that I'm in my practice I have an appreciation for her unique style that initially wasn't there years ago.  She gives guidance and verbal cues as she does the asanas, including kramas for a few.  It's amazing how intuitive the dialogue is.  Just as my mind begins to wander or I resist the urge to let go, Shiva's voice guides me back on the path as if she's standing right there.  Love it!",1326931200,,857,4.234567901234568
4698751,3,B005GYXNO0,"I am a big Shiva fan and was really looking forward to this release.  I'm pretty disappointed with the overall product.  The flows overall are not as varied as in her other dvds, I felt like I kept doing more of the same thing for a lot of them.  This also makes it impossible to really feel like you've done anything in twenty minutes, I find I pair a harder one with a restorative in order to get the same benefits that I got from doing one routine from her previous Daily Energy.  I felt like this was more of a beginning daily energy video, though the lack of instruction she gives would require you not to be beginner or to view before you actually tried to practive.  It seems that these flows were the leftovers from AM Energy, could have been called PM Restorative Flow. Overall, it just doesn't have the same quality that I've come to expect from Shiva.  If you are new to Shiva, this wouldn't be a bad place to start, since I think her other dvds are much more challenging that this one.  I'll primarily use it for muscle recovery purposes more than a staple to my regular yoga routine.",1325721600,3,1096,4.317073170731708
4698752,3,B005GYXNO0,"I don't think this video is as great as the other reviewers.  In fact, I'm considering returning it because I just don't feel any desire to do any of the practices.  I watched the entire DVD first, as I always do before practicing it for the first time, and it seemed very boring to me.  I agree with the other reviewer about the boring music and I don't know how to exactly describe it but even Shiva's instructions sounded weird. Rehearsed and forced, maybe?  Also when I was watching it it was very hard to distinguish which flow I was watching because there were no color or background changes.

Of course, Yoga Shakti is my favorite yoga DVD of all time so I compare everything to that one.  This one was dull and didn't seem challenging.  Except for maybe the Heart flow evolution sequence which I believe was the one that had a lot of arm balances.  All in all I'm disappointed and just wanted to share my honest opinion.",1325376000,7,928,4.41764705882353
4698753,5,B005GYXNO0,"Shiva has once again created a calming, flowing yoga practice. This DVD is a follow-up to the Shiva's Daily Energy practice.

The DVD  routines:

Opening Meditation (11 minutes)

Lunar Flows:
--Foundation Sahaja (20 minutes)
--Foundation Heart Flow (20 minutes)
--Foundation Standing (20 minutes)

Solar Flows:
--Prayer Wheel (20 minutes)
--Evolution Flow (20 minutes)
--Evolution Heart Flow (20 minutes)
--Evolution Standing Balance (20 minutes)

Shavasana (7 minutes).

There are also six pre-set practices, ranging in time from 47 minutes to 58 minutes.

What I enjoyed about this DVD:

**The matrix option, so I can really customize my workout.

**The individual 20 minute practices can stand on their own, or be used together.  I don't know what it is about these practices, but I tend to do at least two of them at one time.  With Shiva's original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shiva-Rea-Daily-Energy-Vinyasa-Flow-Yoga/dp/B002IVLWCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shiva Rea: Daily Energy - Vinyasa Flow Yoga</a>, I tend to choose just one of the daily practices.

**The poses aren't particularly difficult so I didn't feel that a lot of form pointers were needed.  Shiva gives some basic instruction on the poses, but doesn't go into a lot of detail.  This is fine with me.  I consider myself an intermediate yoga practitioner and I am very familiar with most poses, so as long as I hear the name of the pose, I can do it.

**The Evolution Standing Flow Solar practice.  This was the most energizing of the daily practices.  I surprised myself by being able to hold my balance throughout most of it!

**The clear labeling of lunar (relaxing) and solar (energizing) practices on the matrix.

**Shiva's calming voice and unobtrusive music.  I enjoyed the music on this DVD since it fit the workout.

**The interesting props.  I believe that one background figurine is Ganesha (the elephant diety), one of the key figures in the Hindu religion.  There is a musical instrument, as well as some necklaces.  I would love to learn the significance of these.

Some things I did not care for in this workout:

**The backdrop is very basic.  It looks like a brownish-gold sheet draped over the floor and on the walls.  I have been spoiled by Shiva's earlier DVDs, which were filmed in beautiful places like the Maldives Islands, White Sands National Park and Kauai.

**The opening meditation is very calming and it's a good way to get centered.  However, I find it a bit too calming for my morning practice.  I use this meditation as part of my evening practice.  I much prefer the separate solar and lunar meditations in Shiva's Daily Energy Flow.

Even though most of the poses are pretty easy, this is not a DVD for beginners.  Shiva doesn't give a lot of details about the poses and if you're not familiar with the poses, you'll be constantly  straining to watch Shiva to see what you should be doing.

My typical workouts with this DVD would be:

Solar--Prayer Wheel plus one other Solar practice OR
Lunar-Opening Meditation plus one or two Lunar practices.

I recommend this DVD for anyone wanting to incorporate more yoga in their daily lives.  With the 20 minute segments, it is easily doable with this DVD.",1325289600,6,3252,5.083333333333333
4698754,3,B005GYXNO0,"I use Shiva Rea's first ""Daily Energy"" video regularly and was looking forward to ""More Daily Energy"", however, I was very disappointed. The background is boring, her hair hangs in her face, the music is dull and droning, the video lacks the extra core and forward bending sections, and the changes in color that indicate selection of a practice from the matrix are so subtle that you can barely see them. Most frustrating of all, Shiva fails to teach. In her voice-over she comments on the poses, but frequently forgets to actually tell you what to do. It makes you feel like she doesn't care about you. A yoga video student should not glance over at the screen to see that the teacher has moved on to another pose while commenting about something else. The seven practices are so varied that few individuals will like all of them. It may have been better to make a ""Lunar daily energy"" and a ""Solar daily energy"" OR a ""Beginner"" and an ""Advanced"". I'll probably do the seventh practice from time to time because it is at my level, but it is not an adequate stand alone practice - be sure to warm up substantially before starting the practice.",1324857600,29,1144,4.558252427184466
4698755,5,B005GYXNO0,"Great product and easy to do, Shiva Rea is one of the best yoga instructors in the world and her daily energy works great for the beginner. Thanks again",1323734400,,152,4.275862068965517
4698756,5,B005GYXNO0,"I received the latest Shiva Rea DVD last weekend, and I had tried a couple of previews on the Acacia website over the last couple of months. So now that I have had time to work through these practices, I am excited to say I really love this DVD. There are seven 20 minute practices, plus shavasana and meditation. The practices are intermediate to advanced. There are some arm balances that I can't even attempt at the moment, but I am glad they are there as I can get into the early stages and I feel I have something to work towards. The routines are wonderful, both calming and strengthening. The poses are often different from her previous practices. At first I was disappointed that there were no extra sequences, such as those on the Daily Energy DVD. However when I tried the opening meditation I was happy to learn this is also a forward bend sequence, which I now practice before bed. There is a substantial amount of material in this DVD which should keep most people happy for quite a while.

At times Shiva's instruction is not the easiest to follow, however as I learn the practices I know what is coming and I actually appreciate this aspect as more time is spent in the pose, rather that being told how to get into it. I think there is an expectation of prior yoga knowledge with this DVD, which is important to consider if you are new to yoga.

If you are new to yoga, I recommend one trying one of Shiva's other DVDs first and working your way up to this one. If you are an advanced yoga practitioner but new to Shiva, I would recommend this DVD. If you already have Shiva's other DVDs, I would still definitely recommend this one as it is different enough from her others to provide you with variety and some challenging poses.",1323043200,4,1745,4.416149068322981
4698757,5,B005GYXNO0,"I wrote my review before I saw Yoni's great review!  This is another terrific DVD by Shiva, with something to offer all levels.  The 20 minute selections can be used either on their own, or combined with others for a longer practice.  There is the usual Yoga Matrix as well as Preset practices.  Selections are:

o Opening Meditation (11 min):  A blend of forward bends and meditation. I'm not super flexible in forward bends, so I sat on a small pillow through part of it, coming out of the forward bends as needed.  A very nice peaceful, quiet flow to connect you to the flow of your breath.

Three lunar practices are listed on the Matrix from simplest to more challenging.  Each is approximately 20 minutes long.

o Foundation Sahaja:  Shiva mentions Sahaja as being spontaneous arising, but another meaning is natural, simple, easy which describes this flow very well. Starts sitting with some gentle spinal waves, moving into slow cat/cow, then to downward dog. The flow includes low lunge, half splits, sphinx, cobra, Anahatasana, ""sacred rolling"",  Janu Sirsasana, seated Parighasana, and Dhanurasana (Bow Pose). She uses slow, gentle pulses throughout the first part of the flow, adding in gentle twists for the second half.  A lovely relaxing flow.  Yummy.

I completed the next two flows using her Preset 2 practice, which adds the meditation at beginning, and Shavasana at the end.

o Foundation Heart Flow: A gentle backbending flow including cat/cow, half Chaturanga, cobra, downward dog, low lunge circling through to half splits, half Dhanurasana (bow) from all fours, full Dhanurasana, upward dog, Ustrasana (camel) - adding the more challenging poses as the flow builds through the first  or so of the flow. She then moves to lying on the back with bridge pose variations including single leg, and then to reclining pigeon and spinal twist.  The flow closes with seated spinal twist and Gomukhasana.

o Foundation Standing: This is the most challenging of the lunar/beginner practices. Starts again with cat/cow alternating pulling the knee to the navel, and then roll to standing.  In standing she repeats the movement of alternating raising the knee to the navel, then moves into Uttanasana, plank to half Chaturanga, pulling into downward dog with leg raises, moving into low lunge and half splits.  She then moves into standing poses, extending into Utthita Trikonasana (triangle) on both sides, and then moving to the center for wide legged yoga squat (Goddess) and Prasarita Padottanasana, then repeats starting with half Chaturanga adding Warrior 2 variations.  The flow builds adding tree, pyramid pose, and closing with hand to big toe. She adds gentle twists and gentle sweeping arm movements to many of the standing poses. The flow has a nice restorative feel.

There are 4 solar ""intermediate"" practices.  I completed the second two as her Preset 4 option (Opening Meditation, Evolution Standing Balance, Evolution Heart Flow, and Shavasana) and loved the combination.

o Prayer Wheel:  A slow moving, classic Sun Salutation flow with low lunge.

o Evolution Flow: A mandala (circular) flow.  Includes wide leg squat (Goddess), chair, Uttanasana, Chaturanga, cobra/upward to downward dog, and low lunge variations.  About half way through the flow she moves to standing, then to Malasana and optionally into the arm balance Bhujapidasana.  She begins the mandala again, this time with Warrior I variations, Chaturanga Dandasana, and locust to bow pose. The flow closes with chair, gentle standing side bend, standing back bend, back to Malasana and optional arm balances (Bhujapidasana, half Titibasana/ Bhujapidasana, Astavakrasana).

o Evolution Heart Flow: A backbend flow, begins standing alternating between standing back bend and forward bend, moving to plank, Anahatasana,  camel and downward dog.  From there she moves into crescent, Warrior 3 with both knees bent, back to crescent, low lunge with twist (Parivrtta Anjaneyasana), half split, half bow from all fours, then repeats this cycle again. The next cycle includes the shoulder openers - forearm plank, dolphin, and bow.  She returns to standing with twisting chair, Uttanasana, standing bow pose prep (hand down for balance), crescent, full standing bow pose (Natarajasan), twisting crescent, half splits to optional full splits, standing splits,  and Warrior 3 to Natarajasan. She returns to dolphin and plank, then moving to one leg bow pose and full bow.  The flow closes with bridge, then one-leg bridge moving to shoulderstand with several leg variations, plow pose variations, and optional wheel pose.

o Evolution Standing Balance:  I chuckled a couple times in this flow as she said she was going into an ""intermediate flow"" and then went into some pretty challenging work!  I can't do the arm balances at all, but still really enjoyed this.  There are quite a few transition poses I have left out. The initial balance section includes a bent knee Warrior 3, standing hand to big toe, and standing pigeon moving optionally to Galavasana, and then a flowing chair pose sequence.  She then moves into three rounds of standing pose variations including crescent, twisting into a pose Shiva calls Parshva Anjaneyasana, up into crescent pose, warrior 3 variations, gate pose (Parighasana), low lunge and Eka Pada Koundiyanasana.  From here she moves into dolphin, bow, upward dog, and then to standing.  The next section starts similar to the beginning of this flow, this time with standing bow prep (hand down), standing splits, side crow, twisted half moon, and Visvamitrasana.",1314316800,20,5579,5.228346456692913
4698758,5,B005GYXNO0,"I was so happy to see a new Shiva Rea DVD (currently available on acacia) and not just a DVD but a follow up to Daily Energy with brand new 7 practices. The practices on the matrix are divided to 3 lunar practices that are suitable for beginners and 4 solar that are more intermediate though I think all practices are easy to modify and the pace is good. here are brief descriptions of the practices that you can choose from the matrix (I probably left out some of the poses).

Opening Meditation - 11 min. actually a 2 in 1 segment, you can sit in meditation or do the forward bends that she demonstrate : pachimotanasana , double pigeon + a twist variation, wide leg forward bend , all are held pretty long. it's actually great to finish a practice with this segment.

Lunar :
Foundation Sahaja - 22:20 min. a great relaxing flow , with a nice song from shaman's dream. includes some undulating the spine while sitting, in cat & cobra. forward bends, bow ,""sacred rolling"" and more. very mellow.

Foundation Heart Flow - 20:41 min. - the beginning backbend practice. starts with usual shiva backbend prep. including half spits, kneeling bow, lunges etc. culminating in camel and bridge with a few variations (one legged, pigeon leg) and ends with a rather long sequence of counter twists and forward bends.

Foundation Standing - 24:50 min. - a long slow flow of basic standing poses (trikonasana, prasarita , warriors, goddess, tree , parsvotanasana and the rather advanced hand to big toe balance) although mellow I can see a certain challenge in this practice.

Solar:
Prayer Wheel - 21:27 min. a low lunge sun salutation sequence . not much variation here excepts she adds standing half splits and twisted chair towards the end. very meditative but energizing. good as a warm up.

Evolution Flow - 22:05 min. a fun flow in mandala style ! similar to her previous mandala namaskars and includes goddess , lunges with tiger stance that prepare us for the arm balance bhujapidasana half way through. then it's warrior variations in the mandala with some bows and then bhujapidasana again and if you can, she demonstrates titibasana and astavakrasana arm balances. definitely no long holds in the arm balances and you can skip them and stay in the previous pose. also good as a warm up practice to start with.

Evolution Heart Flow - 21:33 min. the more advanced backbending sequence includes some standing balances , pincha mayurasana prep. bow and a one leg variation. twisted chair and lunge, full splits if you can (: standing half bow (similar to natarajasana), bridge and shoulderstand & halasana with variations , since yoga shakti she didn't do shoulderstands so that was nice to see. then it's back to bridge from shoulderstand and an optional full wheel or viparita dandasana. loved it .

Evolution Standing Balance - 22 min. the most advanced vinyasa and full of arm balances ! ekapada galavasana , gate pose, ekapada koundinyasana 1 & 2 (or side crow), warrior 3, bow, hand to big toe, standing half splits, twisted half moon that Shiva never did on a dvd before , and visvamitrasana. I really liked this one, challenging but not super fast, you can always skip the arm balances transitions that she doesn't hold long anyway, I would actually wish for longer holds in the arm balances but I loved it anyway, very playful and fun.

Shavasana - 7:53 min. finally a nice long shavasana.

some more stuff you might wnt to know:
there's 6 pre-set practices.
no side planks at all ( although I love them).
this time there's no audio options which doesn't bother me. (in previous DVD's there's music only track).
the background is the same as her previous DVD A.M energy.
the music is great.
Shiva is encouraging and wonderful as always and gives some alignment tips.

I enjoyed the practices a lot and it's a great follow up, I think I might like this one more than the previous Daily Energy because the practices feel more varied to me.",1314230400,72,3945,4.711175616835995
4698759,3,B005GYXNO0,Nit the sort of yoga I was expecting. An interesting change of pace but rather relaxed and not particularly challenging,1394323200,,119,5.0
4698760,2,B005GYXNO0,"The instant video version of this doesn't give you any menu options to move around the different routines. I'm not even sure I have all the routines. The total run-time for instant video and what's listed is the same, so I guess i have to figure out where to fast-forward to each routines starting point... which is difficult since you cannot see what's happening while fast-forwarding the video. The back-drop is terrible. I'd rather see a standard studio over the odd setup they chose. And as other's have stated, she's sometimes changes postures without notice. This was my first video from Shiva Rea... I've heard she's one of the best, but I'm not likely to get another one after this experience. Too many other options out there.",1392595200,,735,4.7952755905511815
4698761,2,B005GYXNO0,"I am hesitant to leave anything by Shiva a bad review, and honestly, it's not even her program that is bad.  What is bad is that the Amazon Instant Video Option gives you less than half of the DVD.  I paid $0.50 more to have it instantly, only to find I got half as much programming.  To top it off, what I really wanted was the Solar flow, and that is what I didn't get!  So save yourself some irritation, and exercise your patience while you wait for the DVD :) Namaste!",1391126400,,472,4.0978260869565215

4698763,3,B005GYXNO0,"This video is divided into four parts. This doesn't help the flow too much. I don't know why she does this. Also, one must frequently watch her to figure out how to move. This does not help to keep the neck relaxed. And there is a lot of back movement in this practice. However, the movements are good. It's a nice restorative practice that doesn't require much impact. I would recommend this practice if you need to stretch, especially your back and torso.",1390176000,,457,4.518072289156627

4698765,3,B005GYXNO0,"I have the DVD and really enjoy choosing my own yoga session using the matrix.  I like to have my yoga more portable, so I have several of Shiva's videos on my Kindle Fire.  The Instant Video version does not have a matrix and only has the Lunar workout; the Solar workout is not included, so you're only getting half the content.  I understand if the matrix will not work on a tablet, but I still would expect to receive all the content.

Shiva's yoga instruction is excellent as always.",1389052800,5,488,4.388888888888889
4698766,3,B005GYXNO0,"For me it was not enough instruction; compared to, say, Power yoga by Rodney Yee. Some of the pose transitions lack fluidity making it difficult to follow.

We used to go on vacation to exotic locations like a lush green waterfall in the mountains of India, or a white desert with several our dancing friends, or on a deserted beach along the ocean of California or India.......just me and Shiva would travel the world with our yoga mats --enjoying the view.

Now--we never go anywhere---we are stuck in the same studio ---all the time---we never go on location vacation.....anymore....those where the good times....",1377820800,4,619,4.618181818181818

Highly recommend to all fitness levels.",1361491200,,346,4.428571428571429

I thought this dvd would fulfill these wishes as well as be a nice challenge.  Well, this is definitely a challenge, but not the challenge I was looking for - this is very hard to follow along with.  I have found in the short time I've had the dvd that I am constantly looking to see what she is doing next.  I have found that she moves on to the next pose sometimes wi/o informing you.  For me, this dvd has been a waste of $$.",1360195200,,651,3.9015151515151514

I just find that both DVDs are very similar which is the only thing I would change. I find myself repeating the same positions. My favorite part is the morning meditation and how flexible it is (you can choose to follow the exercise or meditate) I also like the longer shavasana in this DVD compared to the first one. Overall, it does what it says I just would like there to be a little more variety.",1353628800,,565,4.289719626168225

4698779,5,B005GYXNO0,"I bought this video on demand because I wanted a practice that was longer in length, and that I could stream from my tablet, or laptop when on the go. I knew that I wouldn't be getting all 7 of the practices from the DVD, (so don't be surprised because the video is only an hour and four minutes, the DVD would be almost 3 hours long). This video contains 4 segments from the dvd, and can be broken down however you would like, you just have to know the times to switch too.

It begins with a meditation forward bend sequence. I really liked this because meditation is often left out on yoga videos, or is just silent, and Shiva does a great job of guiding you through a meditation while sitting in different forward bends.

Then there are two different 20 minute practices, I do them both together to make one 40 minute practice. They are both lunar segments from the DVD. but they are excellent. Both practices work on freeing the spine, through pulsation asanas and back bends. I really liked both the practices, as they contain a few twists, some lunges, and a lot of forward folds, and a bunch of back bending in the second sequence. I have back problems, and hip problems so the combination of easy movement,pulsation, and forward bending and back bending helps to alleviate some of the tightness in my back and hips.

the last segment is shavasana pose, (corpse pose), and it last a while, like 7 minutes, so its nice, relaxing and grounding.

Just a note for anyone looking to buy this as a workout, this is not the type of yoga to make you work up a sweat, its very relaxing, and focuses on stretches not strength building. For that I would recommend looking in to the DVD, or the first DVD of Shiva Rea Daily Energy Flow, there are some great Solar flows on there which will build up a sweat, as well as other lunar flows.",1341100800,4,1832,4.379411764705883
4698780,5,B005GYXNO0,"I have the first Daily Energy, so as far as Shiva's style, I enjoy it. If you haven't done a Shiva Rea DVD before, go read through the reviews of the first DVD so you can get an idea of who is best suited for her practice.

I like this one more than the first. I find it more challenging and it brings out more emotion in me than the first one. I think I also find it more calming than the first, but I'm not sure how to exactly describe this.

Believe it or not, I love the opening meditation, which is about 11 minutes of forward folds. I never warmed up with seated forward folds before and now I addicted, even if it is not a strong point for me. Now I am in a habit of doing them if I get to class early, to warm myself up a bit.

If you liked the first one, then getting this one will complement. It isn't a rinse and repeat of Daily Energy, so there is great variety.",1340755200,2,874,3.8715083798882683
4698781,5,B005GYXNO0,"Dear, Shiva Rea, I want to say how special your teaching of yoga has been for me. I hope and pray I meet you someday. Wherever you are residing in the world I hope it is lovely there.

4698782,2,B005GYXNO0,"I love the format of this DVD. You have 5 sessions of 20 minutes each, both am and pm workouts. The fact that you can set them up to play as a customized sequence is fantastic, all yoga DVD's should be set up this way. The bad news is I do not care for Shiva's style of constant moving and wiggling. I like the linear aspect of yoga and I am  afraid I will hurt my back or pull a muscle with this  wiggling motion. Not my favorite,",1337817600,,431,3.8863636363636362
4698783,5,B005GYXNO0,"I bought both the original Daily Energy and the More Daily Energy Shiva Rea DVDs. When I was casually watching the first DVD, Daily Energy, just to get a feel of the movements, I quickly realized I would have a lot of trouble with the routines being a beginner to yoga. I felt better after checking out some of the Lunar routines on the More Daily Energy DVD. So far I have done these routines in the morning and it is a nice gentle way to wake up and get prepared for the day. I love it and look forward to eventually doing more of her advanced routines.

Other than that I love Shiva's teaching style. She only says what needs to be said. She guides you very well through the movement and the breath work.",1337212800,4,707,4.198529411764706
4698784,5,B005GYXNO0,"I love Shiva Rea.  I understand how some people get frustrated with her consistent use of yogi terminology without much explanation, which makes her difficult to follow for true beginners, but she does a *bit* better than usual in this DVD.  While she continues to use Sanskrit terms, she does mention more often what these poses mean (in English) than she usually does in other DVDs.  I found that this makes the practice much easier to follow even during the first few viewings.  I also just really like the style of the practices.  They are at a much slower pace than the original Daily Energy (even the solar practices aren't as sweat-inducing as Heart-Fire and other ones), which makes for a very enjoyable ""meditative-like"" practice.  There is an 11 minute Opening Meditation which is either a meditation or a Forward Bend series, which I truly enjoy.  All of the other sequences are in 20 minute segments, and Shavasana is 7 minutes.  The possible 'downside' to this is that the shortest possible sequence you could come up with is 27 minutes, therefore it's not a quick-workout DVD.  If you are looking for the type of yoga that is more of a workout in and of itself, I would suggest the original Daily Energy over this one, but if you are looking for a more spiritual/meditative experience, or you truly are a beginner, then I would recommend this DVD.  As always, Shiva Rea has the Yoga Matrix as well as Pre-Set Practices (I believe there are 8 on this one), which makes it easy to switch up your routine whenever you would like!  It might not be for everyone, but I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1333497600,10,1614,4.647887323943662
4698785,1,B005GYXNO0,"I was VERY disappointed in this after reading so many positive reviews. I've been doing yoga for a few years and have many DVDs from a variety of instructors. This is the first time I've used one of Shiva's and she is the first one I've run across who fails to cue you during the routines. Many times during the routine I looked up at the TV to see she was in a completely different pose. She had moved on without instructing the viewer to do so! This happened many times, not just once or twice. The only way I could possibly do these routines would be to watch them all several times, memorize them, and then do them. Not! Total waste of money. I'll be trading this one in. Much Much prefer Zyrka Landwijt's vinyasa flow DVD.",1331683200,4,727,4.27536231884058
4698786,5,B005GYXNO0,I heard about this DVD from a friend and I had to try it out. I love the different options on the DVD.,1329350400,,102,3.4782608695652173
4698787,4,B005GYXNO0,"I am always excited to see a new Shiva Rea DVD and this one has its own unique style. As of late, there are no classical sun salutations, but instead a lot of lunging, twisting and back bending. I wish there were more variety--if I chose 3 20 minute sequences, I often will find myself repeting a pose. I like a challenging workout, so I don't do the 3 lunar sequences - they are more beginner level. I am already used to having to pick and choose on Shiva's DVD's to customize a practice that is right for me. If you're a Shiva fan, you won't want to miss this DVD.",1329177600,2,566,4.108108108108108
4698788,5,B005GYXNO0,The video has a lot of great moves. It is good for beginners and more advanced students. I like the different ways to mix and match the workouts.,1328227200,,145,4.214285714285714
8472467,2,B005GYXNO0,"I loved the DVD, and after checking it out from the library several times, I decided to buy it on Amazon Video. Oops. Rather than having several short (10 to 20 minute) morning and evening routines, everything is strung together in an hour-long practice, and several routines are omitted. It totally defeats the purpose of having morning and evening sessions with different focal points. Buy the DVD. You'll get way more out of it!!!",1473465600,,433,4.864864864864865
8472468,3,B005GYXNO0,"So first, I would note I returned this. It is not noted on the description; but this DVD is one of the two DVDs included in the Shiva Rea Daily Energy Collection, so if you have that or are thinking of getting it - don't get this DVD. Otherwise below is my review of this DVD based on my use of it form the 2 DVD collection.

I am certified to teach prana flow through Shiva Rea's teacher training program. It is a style I love and have embodied in my practice for 6-7 years. After two knee surgeries and with a hectic work and life schedule I decided to explore more of her DVDs so that I could practice on my own time and get back into a daily practice (while rehabbing my second knee surgery I was unable to do yoga for year plus, so my personal practice has suffered and I have to rebuild what was lost in that time frame). For me the idea of 20 min daily routines that I could fit in daily and then combine for longer practices as time permitted was great and why I bought this set (NOTE this is a set and both of these DVDs are sold separately - I note this because I also bought ""More Daily Energy"" which I will now be returning as it is one of the two DVDs included).

Pros:
I love the style (hence getting certified in it)
There are 20 min segments or ""waves"" (though these are not complete sequences and are not the pre-set sequences which range form 37-55 mins) rather you can go in the matrix and select a 20 min segment
It has injected some variety into my personal practice, which because of my injury has become a bit stale.

Cons:
These are intermediate to advanced, and even as someone who is certified in Prana Flow I at times had trouble following (not all of the transitional cues are clear and it felt faster then a typical prana flow sequence/wave
There are few modifications or kramas offered - people with injuries, new to yoga, or new to this style may have trouble self modifying or using a krama (an foundational or less advanced pose that would provide the same energetic flow)
Because I am certified I know kramas and because of my injury I have and use props (blocks, straps, etc); however because of the pace set (which felt faster then a typical prana flow sequence/wave (typically a wave would be made up of 2-3 poses or kramas to build and prepare your body to reach the final pose) I was challenged to have time to incorporate modifications before she would move on to a new pose. For example, in the 20 min segment I did this morning over 8-12 poses versus a typical 3-5 that would be a part of a 20 min wave.

All in all I gave it a 3 because it is ok, for the intermediate to advanced (or those not rebuilding their practice post injury) it is probably great. For the new/beginner level or those rebuilding their practice it is challenging to follow; but does offer a great deal of variety and flexibility - so if you don't let the challenge overtake you, you have a lot of opportunity for growth. I would say if you are a beginner or newer to Prana flow you may want to watch the segments first then join in the practice. I know time consuming; but it will help you in following along. I would also say don't be put off because you can't do every pose she does immediately; take the stage/or pose you can while working towards full expression of the pose she is offering.",1452643200,,3310,4.257551669316375
8472469,5,B005GYXNO0,"Shiva Rea's delivery of instruction is joyfully calming and inspiring. My body feels so much better after just 2 weeks. I suggest the forward bend meditation, a 20 min session, and another meditation at the end. I use the last time to complete any moves that my body still needs, and then end with relaxation. Thank you Shiva!",1442275200,,326,4.637931034482759
8472470,2,B005GYXNO0,The matrix does not work streaming.  There are no menu options whatsoever.  Yoga should never cause this kind of frustration.,1440115200,,125,5.2
8472471,1,B005GYXNO0,"I love Shiva Rea, and all of her videos.  I'm sure this one is great also.  But I just want to caution viewers that the Matrix (where you can create your own daily routines) does NOT work when you buy this on instant video.  I guess it only works with DVD format.  That was very disappointing for me as travel and didn't want to pack up a bunch of DVDs.",1434931200,,353,4.0
8472472,4,B005GYXNO0,"The first few are pretty boring. They are repetitive and very basic moves, but the last couple sessions are a great challenge and much more interesting",1428019200,,151,4.846153846153846
8472473,3,B005GYXNO0,"The yoga is lovely, but instruction is an art, too, and this is the weaker aspect of the DVD. For example, if you're looking down during a pose you might hear ""change here"" and then need to look up at the screen to figure out what's going on. Typical cues include ""press open"" and ""push out through the heart,"" which didn't help me hear where to put my hands and feet or how to position my body. Most DVD routines are designed so that when you switch sides you're still facing the screen, but in this case when you switch sides during triangle pose, for example, you'll be facing away from the screen and need to crane around to see what Shiva Rea is doing--especially because she's not narrating it.

I enjoyed some of the poses; they felt like they could be very relaxing if I weren't worried about my form and trying to figure out what was going on. If you are already confident about your form and are willing to do this routine a few times through until you've memorized it--and especially if you want to experience more unstructured, spontaneous movement in your practice, you might get a lot out of this DVD. If you are interested in learning a more wave-like, breath-based flow but still want the structure and clear instruction, try MICHELINE BERRY'S LIQUID ASANA.",1422144000,,1273,4.558951965065503
