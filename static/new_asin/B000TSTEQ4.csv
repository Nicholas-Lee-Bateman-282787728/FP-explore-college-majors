8210859,2,B000TSTEQ4,"Way too many prolonged, violent hunting scenes.  Same for the breeding scenes.  Like Law and Order SVU all over again.  I wanted it for a middle school/high school class and found it inappropriate for a classroom or home setting for them and me..",1424563200,,246,4.674418604651163

8210863,5,B000TSTEQ4,The dvds brought back memories to when I was younger when I looked in the paper and saw there was a National Geographic special going to be on television that week. Since I had the opportunity to visit some of these natural places it was especially enjoyable to view them. The dvds were of good quality and are highly recommended.,1284249600,4,330,4.516666666666667
8210864,5,B000TSTEQ4,This was a great purchase. I teach 5th grade science and my students were captivated by 2 of the videos. We have not and will probably not watch them all because of time constraints. I am looking forward to viewing them all personally. National Geographic is a truly high quality company.,1235260800,7,288,4.666666666666667
8210865,5,B000TSTEQ4,"I am an avid National Geographic fan I own tons of the VHS and get most of the good wildlife videos when the come out on DVD.  This collection is made up of some of the great programs that were on VHS but now found in this DVD collection make for a wildlife fans dream.  There are 12 programs in this set some of the best are Realm Of The Coyte,Secrets Of The Everglades,African Animal Oasis,Crodiles Here Be Dragons,Creatures Of The Namib and more.  National Geographic gets it right and having all these in one set is well worth it I highly recommend this to other wildlife fans.",1193702400,29,581,4.361111111111111
