had amazing production quality.  Just because he didn't kill someone or go to
jail for selling drugs, doesn't mean his story isn't great.  That footage of Jeff
Phillips before he died is amazing as well!",1253059200,4,283,4.854166666666667
8370319,3,B0010E6J6Y,"POOR PRODUCTION VALUES. THE DOCUMENTARY WASNT THAT GREAT FOR THE FACT THAT IT DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH DRAMA. I LIKE JON COMERS, BUT I FELT IT NEEDED MORE. AN INSPIRATION FOR SURE. I SUGGEST IF YOUR INTO SKATEBOARD DOCUMENTARIES TRY HOSOI RISING SUN, GATOR STOKED, DWAYNE PETERS DOC, OR THE JOHN CARDIEL EPICLY LATER'D. THIS ONE JUST FELL A BIT SHORT.",1249257600,2,344,4.75
