3128990,4,B0014C2FX8,"Last Crusade is the least favorite of mine in the Indy series. However, it's in great company and still a fun edition to anybody's collection. And in terms of George Lucas ""grabbing people's money"", it's the distributor who decides when and how they will release and re-release a film. George is not the distributor. When the VHS versions of Star Wars were released in 2001, fans kept complaining that they wanted it on DVD. George didn't want to release them on DVD until after the prequels had finished because of the recent VHS release. The distributor, however, decided to give the fans what they wanted, and just two years later, they released the trilogy on DVD. Fans were now outraged that the original versions of the film weren't available. Therefore, the distributor decided to re-release the trilogy again, this time with the original version. Fans complained again because they had just bought the trilogy on DVD. Well, George has very little authority on distributing DVD releases and the distributor was only reacting to the feedback from the fans. Get a grip people. George is not desperate for money, he already has as much as anybody could dream of.",1210291200,,1166,4.893939393939394

It is your choice to buy these films but i would suggest to prove the difference between the old and this new edition.

3128992,4,B0014C2FX8,"The details of new DVD editions of the three classic classic Indiana Jones movies with all-new special features have been announced.  They'll be available separately for the first time on DVD, or as a set.  They were previously only available on DVD as a set.

The new releases will coincide with the new movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which comes out on May 22nd.  They'll have new special features designed to introduce new Indy fans to the old movies, as well as to introduce old fans to the new movie.

The Indiana Jones movies are George Lucas's recreation/update of the serialized adventures of the 1930s and '40s.  Made in the '80s and set in the '30s, they feature Harrison Ford as a mild-mannered archeology professor who moonlights as an adventurous seeker of priceless antiquities.  This takes him to exotic locations across the world, and gets him in some very tight spots of the kind that only a movie hero could get into, or out of.  He invariably finds himself opposed by dangerous men with evil plans for the powerful objects only he has the skills to recover.  There are elaborate set pieces with creepy critters, ancient traps, fights with weapons from bare hands to airplanes and tanks, and sometimes supernatural forces.  Along the way Jones manages to have some romance too.  Humor is a big part of the fun.

This is the third in the series, after Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  It begins with a teenaged Indy trying unsuccessfully to save an artifact from thieves, during which we get background on his signature fedora, bull whip, fear of snakes and his father.  Then we jump to 1938, when Indy learns his father, played by Sean Connery, has gone missing while searching for the Holy Grail, which the Nazis have designs on for world domination.  Joining with a somewhat dim museum owner and the beautiful woman Indy's father had been working with, Indy has close calls in Venice, Austria, and Turkey as he closes in on the Grail and, in the end, bonds with dad.

This one returns to the lighter tone of Raiders, after the somewhat darker Temple of Doom, and perhaps exceeds Raiders in its emphasis on humor (though I still find Raiders funnier).  It's fun to see Ford and Connery working together.  As always there are very involved set pieces, including a tank battle, an intricate plot full of mystery and action, and some magic.  And critters: this time thousands of rats.

If you don't want the whole set and don't want to wait until May, you could get a used copy of the old Last Crusade DVD (people sell them out of the sets).  The difference is in the extra features.  The bonuses from the old set are on their own disc, so what you get when you buy just the old Last Crusade DVD is pretty bare.  The new release, on the other hand, has the following, all new:

-- ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: An Introduction"" by director Steven Spielberg and creator/producer George Lucas

-- ""The Women: The American Film Institute Tribute,"" in which the three Indiana Jones women (Karen Allen, Kate Capshaw and Alison Doody) reunite for a discussion

-- ""Friends and Enemies,"" in which Spielberg, Lucas and Indiana Jones writers discuss how they created the original characters, and a look at new faces in the new movie

-- storyboards: the opening sequence

-- DVD galleries of illustrations, props, production stills and portraits, FX/Industrial Light and Magic stuff, and promotion/marketing materials

-- ""Lego Indiana Jones,"" a demo and trailer for a game based on the trilogy

If you like a few extras, you'll probably prefer this new DVD, though maybe not enough to upgrade from the old one, or to wait until May.  I like audio commentaries, myself, and since they're easy to produce and tend to bring out points not covered in other features, I subtract one star for a special edition without any, but I look forward to the rest.  If you don't care about commentaries, this may be a five-star DVD for you.

There have been rumors of deleted scenes, but none are included.

Some will want to wait for a high-def release, which makes sense if you have the equipment or plan to get it.  Many speculate that a Blu-ray release will come out for Christmas, but that's sheer guesswork.

There's also some speculation that an even better edition with all four movies will soon supersede this new DVD.  They may bundle the four together, but I doubt that there will be a better edition of this movie soon, if ever, on standard DVD.  Keep in mind that the previous set came out over four years ago, and if not for the new movie, that would probably be the only release during the decade of standard DVD.  The next upgrade may be high-def only, and may not happen for a while.

If you do want the whole trilogy (highly recommended), the new release is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B0014Z4ONE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>, the old set is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B00003CXC5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>.

3128997,4,B0014C2FX8,"RELEASED IN 1989 and directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has Jones (Harrison Ford) globetrotting for the Holy Grail and, along the way, teaming up with his father (Sean Connery). Alison Doody plays an Austrian colleague of the latter.

After the cartoony farce of Temple of Doom (1984), Spielberg went back to the blueprint of Raiders of the Last Ark (1981) to make this third film in the franchise. The problem is that, while good in many ways, Last Crusade is second-rate by comparison. Raiders copped the perfect tone for this kind of adventure flick: Quasi-realistic with a fun, kinetic edge. As wild as the actions scenes in Raiders were, most of them were later reenacted on a TV show in order to see if they were plausible, and they were!

Unfortunately, Last Crusade mixed the plot of Raiders with the silliness of Temple and so many of the action sequences smack more of a cartoon than reality. The escape from the zeppelin in the parasite biplane is a good example. Then theres the silly bickering and bumbling of father and son, like when they're tied-up in the castle or facing the Nazis in (what is now) Turkey.

Thankfully, there are eventually some good scenes between the two, which shed insight on them and their troubled relationship. And the globetrotting is great, starting with Arches National Park, then Venice, an Austrian-German castle, Berlin and Turkey. While cartoony and second-rate (compared to Raiders), the action sequences are often fun and thrilling. And the striking Doody is fine on the female front. Some critics wrote her character off as a blonde bimbo, but this is inexplicable seeing as how shes palpably intelligent and sophisticated. Regrettably, the climax is overlong and curiously dull despite its attempt at spiritual profoundness.

THE MOVIE RUNS 127 minutes and was shot in Arches National Park, Utah; Hertfordshire, England; Venice, Italy;  Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany; London & other places in England; numerous locations in Spain; Colorado; Amarillo, Texas; New Mexico; and Petra, Jordan. WRITERS: Jeffrey Boam wrote the script from the story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes.

3128998,5,B0014C2FX8,"I have no idea what kind of restoration was necessary, but it was successful. Picture and sound were absolutely in synch throughout, and as clear as I remember from when I first saw the production. The story itself, of course, is a slam-bang adventure.",1504915200,,252,4.75
3128999,5,B0014C2FX8,"It may just be coincidence but this time Harrison Ford that was a carpenter is not Dr. Indiana Jones (Junior) and his last crusade (until the next film) is to obtain a cup of a carpenter.

Even though this film can stand on its own, it can be more fully understood if you watch ""Raiders of the lost Ark"" first.

Once again we start out with a young Jones trying to save an artifact from pillagers. This lets us know of his heroic energy and introduces his father Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery) and his obsession with the Holy Grail, even to the exclusion of his relationship with Junior.

Now grown Dr. Indiana Jones gives a class and explains that Archeology is a pretty strait forward science and not some search for legends. He receives a mysterious piece of post.

He is then approached by group of rich people that are in search of the Grail. It turns out that their top researcher has disappeared. Yep it is Professor Henry Jones. What can Indiana do but go looking for his father. He is accounted by his best friend who runs a museum Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliottt) as they team up with the last person to see his father Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody.) He gets a final warning ""Do not trust anybody.""

Will he find his father?
If he dies what will they have to talk about?
Does the Grail really exist?
Who are the mysterious people following him?

One of my favorite scenes is where Dr. Jones disguised in a German uniform bumps into Hitler (Michael Sheard of Star Wars fame).

Have fun watching this great film with the banter between Hennery and Junior. And remember ""do not trust anybody.""",1504828800,,1612,4.5

3129045,4,B0014C2FX8,"I just spent far too much time reading hundreds of these reviews.  Some of the ""bad"" reviews are a bit surprising.
I remember seeing THE LAST CRUSADE in 1989 working as a young college student part time in a Cleveland Heights movie theater.  The ""Indiana"" movie remained at theater for months as other (movies) came and went (only 2 screens).  The consensus was:  Not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark but thank god it was better than The Temple of Doom.  The easy majority seemed to like Indy was battling the ""evil"" Nazis (cartoon cliche) again and no longer had to deal with the just plain silly, haha gross-out, eating eyes and bugs at the dinner party has nothing to do with story scene (in Temple of Doom), for example, while welcoming the mystical, magical, biblical chase to find ""The ArK"" in one and ""The Grail"" in the other.  What was the purpose of Temple of Doom?  Pulse-beating heart ripped-out of chest was memorable in the, uh, mind control scene ... ok.
Anyways, I purchased INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE because it was funny with addition of Connery as dad (and Not a James Bond Type character).  The Young Indy intro (with River Phoenix) is great with snakes explanation.  The blond Austrian femme fatale to be (sort of) is very (Aryan) attractive.  Greed and power and Eternal Life are prevailing themes.  Just about every crowd that I can recall (back in theater in 1989) loved the ""guardians"" line ""He chose ... pooorly"".  Laughs aplenty
The LAST CRUSADE had a great, fun supernatural ending (yeah, Denholm Eliot's character got a bit too oafish, even almost falls off horse at end, haha ... but Kate Capshaw was almost annoyingly worse in ""The Doom"" ... a thankless role in hindsight...?).
Extra interviews with some cast (not Ford) are ok as is the ""Enemies of Indy"" which is a little better than ok.
10 bucks?  Seems like a simple choice to watch INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, again.

3129089,2,B0014C2FX8,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, 1989 film

It begins in a desert where young men on horses ride. They find men digging in a cave. [Plausible?] There is a chase, cars after a horse rider. Young Indy Jones hops a circus train to get away, those men follow. Back home the Sheriff meets him to retrieve that gold cross for its rightful owner. [Think about this.] Years later in the Portuguese Coast (1938) Jones found that gold cross again. It belongs in a museum. [Does this advocate public ownership over private ownership?] Jones jumps overboard with the cross. Back at a college Jones teaches a class on Archaeology, the search for facts. Men meet him to take him to meet Mr. Donovan. His mining for copper found a stone about the Holy Grail. Jones goes to search for this fabled item. First they reach Venice. They search the basement. Somebody searched their rooms.

There is a sinister plot against them. [No mention of the politics of that day.] They visit Baron Grunwalds castle. There is secret activities there. Indy breaks into a room and learns what is there. Junior talks to his Dad. Armed men enters, Indy neutralized them. Then he meets his assistant, who is threatened by a Nazi. You should have listened to your father she says. How did he know she was a Nazi? But pages are torn out of that book. There is more action in Turkey, Marcus went on ahead. Will he get away? [Father and son in love with the same woman? Thats something for the Gerry Stringer Show!] Then there is a fire in the room. [This is played like a farce.] They find a secret door to escape in a motorcycle and side car. There is another chase. Accidents befoul their pursuers. They must recover the diary to find three clues, so they go to Berlin. We see book burning and parades. [Recognize those three uniformed men? All will become suicides.]

Does a bonfire at night have an emotional effect? Indy retrieves the book. Der Fuehrer gives his autograph! Jones father and son plan to fly away on a Zeppelin. One military man does not have a ticket! [No radio contact?] Jones rebukes his father about his upbringing. What can they talk about? The three riddles. As the Zeppelin turns back they must escape. Then a fighter airplane attacks with its machine guns. Their car enters a tunnel, so too that fighter airplane! But another follows. Dad uses his umbrella as a defense! [Comedy?] The Republic of Hatay has a ruler who makes a deal with the Germans, who have Brody and the map, and a WW I tank.

Some protest the invasion for awhile. Indy borrows some horses and is pursued. [More comic scenes.] There is a fight on that tank and inside. Indy is saved! The tank hits the end of the road! And Indy? Hes alive. The Germans follow the map to the canyon of the Crescent Moon. A building is carved into a sandstone cliff. The four are captured! Does a gun produce power? Indy is offered a choice - find the Holy Grail to save his Dads life! Indy solves the three riddles. There is a guardian. Which is the true grail? An error is deadly. Indy chooses wisely, his Dad is saved. Elsa steps backwards and something happens! They escape falling rocks to leave. [Long shots for stunt doubles?]

This movie has  a lot of action but little of a realistic story. A Medieval legend of a Holy Grail is a weak structure to support a story. The Maltese Falcon was a hook to display greed and its foolish consequences, a more believable story. Dont question the plausibility of some of the scenes. CGI can do a lot for a movie. The plot is used to support action, not the other way around. You can compare it to other movies like The Fugitive or some war movies like A Walk in the Sun.",1426464000,,3659,4.470059880239521

3129091,1,B0014C2FX8,"The purchase was a bod one.  I've never received any DVD from this vendor that offered anything but good quality.  It was advertised as ""new"" and I didn't mind paying a bit more for the free Prime two-day delivery.  When I saw and felt the box in which my ""special 20th edition"" arrived I said ""uh oh"".  I've never, quite frankly, knowingly purchased a pirated anything, but the box was made of a material that was barely better than the cello covering some action figure, and the ""skeleton"" of the box was made of the same material which would give next to no protection.  I showed it to my son who promptly said ""hmmmmm"" in his sage, knowing way.  The disc itself was very thin and flimsy and (here's the kicker) DID NOT PLAY.

I purchased all three of the Indiana Jones classic and after trying the frist one, I didn't bother with the other two.

I'm trying to send them back, but Fex Ex hasn't contacted me to schedule the pick up.

3129115,3,B0014C2FX8,"Following the rigid but right hellspawn that was (my favorite entry in the series) ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", the third installment in the Jones trilogy remains watchable but by no means anything else but a nearly complete compromise. If you are one who merely watches movies and cares nothing about how they are made (if you are a person who merely eats what's inside of the sandwich without inspecting it first), then you will give this title a strong notice, and probably find it entertaining; however, if you are aware of any part of the complicated history concerning this script (who we kidding folks, it was a lot of scripts!) then you may want to hesitate before you click that five star button. As a fan of Dr. Jones, I find the third one interesting, certainly amusing, but it's not really an Indiana Jones movie, and that bothers me. The original attempts (by writers Chris Colombus, and Diane Thomas, respectively) actually had the film going in the right direction, but then Lucas and Spielberg (in their watered down refusal to return to the bowels of fun but nasty-minded terror on display in the first two movies) decided to hire ""Funny Farm"" scribe Jeffrey Boam to ""family-proof"" the story and this, in turn, destroyed what was (for me) the fun aspects of an Indiana Jones screen adventure (Boam, though a quality screenwriter, did not seem to understand the danger/mercenary nature of the Jones character at all). What viewers are left with, then, is retread and repeat; the AMAZON editorial claims that this film is closer to the James Bond-oriented tribute that the series was initially intended to be, but even though Connery himself is on board here, it all feels too light, too homage-heavy, and too labored to be really effective. While ""...Temple of Doom"" simply offered slam-bang fantasy, ""...Last Crusade"" toys with the public's mental stability by committing the impardonable sin of actually giving the dumb beast what it wants, and therefore the movie is neither intellectually honest nor seamless but instead a genuine effort to remain more ""realistic."" I don't know about you, but I don't watch Indiana Jones for realism, but rather for fantasy. I shouldn't have to re-open my class to explain that fantasy does not have to include dragons and demons in order to be genuine fantasy in terms of literary (or cinematic) concept, but oh well. The movie was made and that's that. If you like it, you must like it for a reason, but I think there's too much unnecessary humor, too little mayhem and carnage (I don't mean gore), and far too few opportunities to pay tribute to the overly fantastic pulp magazines and movie serials which were the true inspirations for this character and his films. Harrison Ford does his usual immaculate job as the character, but the movie is cowardly, weak in the plot department, and too afraid that it will offend its audience. If Spielberg wants to make a weepy movie about a father-and-son relationship, he should do it elsewhere, and not tamper with the legacy of a great adventure/horror/action movie character (and again, even though ""...Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" took its usual lashings from the all-knowing critics (yeah right), it remains more true, more focused, and more fun than anything on display in this one.
As for the DVD, however, it looks terrific, and it sounds amazing. I have not yet looked into the BluRay transfers, but they are apparently pristine as well. Unfortunately, however, if you are purchasing these newer DVD releases, just be aware that the bonus content is pretty lacking compared to the older box set, which housed three or four really useful (for historians) documentaries on the making of the original Indiana Jones films. All that's included here is a neat (but far too brief) summary of both Lucas's and Spielberg's emotions concerning the making and release of this title. They are, as always, fun to hear from, but they offer little insight in comparison with the older DVD-issues' making of features. Anyway, though, an easy A for picture and sound transfer. But I have to grant the movie a C+ if anything...it's simply too much of a compromise to warrant a strong recommendation.",1411948800,2,4202,4.894810659186536

3129123,1,B0014C2FX8,"INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989) plays like a silly, slapstick comedy, not an Indiana Jones film. For all the of the so-called ""kids movie"" qualities that ""Temple of Doom"" possesses, that movie actually had a more serious overall tone and dark theme than this third film in the franchise. The stunt casting of Connery as Ford's father fails to deliver as they have ZERO chemistry. Their ""relationship"" consists of one-liner after one-liner, like a (INSERT ANY RANDOM COMEDY DUO) routine. Do most people really think these actors possessed natural chemistry? Their every interaction felt forced. Counter this with the more naturally fluid interactions between Ford and his co-stars Allen, Capshaw, and Quan from the previous films. I think the fact that 2 mega-stars were paired was detrimental here. Better to have a lesser-known actor. Maybe more tolerable dialogue would have been given the actors! There is SO much genuine humor in the earlier movies and NONE in this one.

The effects are pretty stale, too. they look amazingly fake and don't hold up as they do in the two preceding, superior films of the franchise. I know it's summer action adventure, but in the previous movies, there was a grit and edge to the action scenes that seemed almost real, whereas here, the action scenes in Crusade play like a pre-cursor to all of the over-the-top, unconvincing, CGI action scenes that have flooded 21st century summer movies. Somehow, in the first 2 films, Spielberg staged the action convincingly. Here, the action scenes just feel STAGED.

And the plot? Nazis again, just like the first one. But the villains here have no panache or personality to speak of. Just a bunch of disposable, insultingly dumb, evil characters. The lead female, a gorgeous blonde, is completely forgettable. I think the Indiana Jones films prove the axiom that beauty seems to be inversely proportional to talent. Karen Allen and Kate Capshaw got nothin on this lady in terms of looks, but completely overshadow her in terms of being able to emote and act! Not nearly enough negative reviews of this horrific ""Indy"" movie.",1404432000,2,2113,5.0

3129145,5,B0014C2FX8,"Love the opening flashback shot in Arches National Park.  River Phoenix as young Indiana was perfectly cast (""everybody's lost but me"").  The circus train sequence was great.  It also helped to show where Indiana Jones' penchant for finding then `losing' artifacts came from.
I liked that they returned to an action packed format for this third film, which is more in keeping with the serials they were trying to emulate.  It also helped that they welcomed back old friends (Denholm Elliott as the ever baffled Dr. Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah), and gave them bigger roles to play.  Unfortunately, they were still off the mark with the female interest, Alison Doody as Dr. Schneider.  From one extreme to the other, they created this damsel with no bite or backbone.  She came off as mere window dressing, very little in the way of personality.  Thank goodness, they got someone substantial to play Indiana's father (Sean Connery).  Without this pairing, the movie wouldn't have worked as well as it did.  Overloaded with action sequences, the best involved a tank and the persistence of Indiana (Ford) plus a rather nasty Nazi.  Hitler even does a cameo!  There's a lot to recommend in this third installment in the franchise.  Better dialog, great music, so much action, and a decent finale.  This film definitely helps take away the bad taste of film number two.",1370649600,,1373,4.913043478260869

3129167,5,B0014C2FX8,"The third in a series of Indiana Jones films, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is a testament to the team of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery who provide us with two hours of entertainment on a grand scale, thanks to some fine direction from Steven Spielberg and a rollicking good script. The duo exchange some lively banter in a believable way, bringing more depth to both characters and making us care more about the adventures of the world's most beloved archaeologist.

Keeping the Holy Grail out of the clutches of the Nazis is what makes the story click from the start, with adventures that range from sea to desert to majestic mountain hideaways, all while Indy and his dad are hotly pursued by the Nazis anxious to get their hands on the cup that promises immortality.

A good supporting cast is on hand to give the story all the excitement it generates, including Denholm Elliot as a clueless professor and Alison Doody as an adventuress who seems to be helping the Nazis but turns against them at a crucial moment until her own greed works against her fate.

All of it is filmed at a breathtaking pace, never stopping long enough to make you dwell on flaws in the logic of Indy's cliffhanging escapes and fights with Nazis aboard tanks in the desert. But aside from action, the script provides plenty of insight into the relationship between father and son, peppered with some witty dialog.

All ages should enjoy this one, about as good as the original Indy film with the addition of Sean Connery providing welcome bits of warmth and humor.",1338163200,,1551,4.670329670329671
3129168,5,B0014C2FX8,"Perhaps the best film of the series is The Last Crusade. It starts slowly then picks up with the appearance of Walter Donovan, a truly fine villain, who's played by Julian Glover. Still the opening scene is used to reveal the estranged relationship between father and son. It also sets the groundwork for the reconciliation that follows in the story. This personal reconciliation will continue with the people in his life in the next film, The Crystal Skull. You'll find more character depiction and development in these last two films than the first two films. Now that's okay with the first film when the characters and the series was being introduced to the public but sequels can be a problem if the character basically stays the same.

River Phoenix performed vey well as a young Jones and the story of Coronado's cross was quite amusing but it sort of stalls with the episode about the recovery of the cross some time later. Still it depicts a man who is still stubbornly insisting on having it his own way: that belongs in a museum! The major storyline begins with his return to college with Coronado's Cross but its the appearance of Walter Donovan that gets the story started and Jones on his way to Europe in search of his father along with their friend, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott). Allison Doody plays the femme fatale, Dr. Elsa Schneider. Like Jones she apparently wants everything her way and will do anything to get it. She and Vogel, the SS officer, each aids Donovan in their own way.

Sean Connery nearly steals the show. His performance as Jones' father was superb. He effectively co-starred with Harrison Ford in this film. John Rhys-Davies as Sallah and Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody are fine support actors. Ford and Connery receive a good deal of support from their friends and their foes in the cast of this story. A real fine scene takes place when Junior asks his Dad how did you know that she was a Nazi?! She talks in her sleep, he replies. It's a well written film filled with plenty of good scenes and reams of talent behind its production. Overall it's really an enjoyable film from start to finish.",1336867200,,2135,4.675531914893617
3129169,5,B0014C2FX8,"This has always been my favorite Indiana Jones movie (and my friends', too). I just love the story and humor and the relationship between the father and son, which is filled with so much angst like so many father-son relationships I know. It's a sweet way to end the trilogy of films. Plus, it made me fall in love with Sean Connery forever after. Many other people I know love Raiders of the Lost Ark best, and consider it the ultimate classic of the series, but this was the film I and my friends saw first, so this is the one that affected us the most. All in all, it's an exhilarating joy-ride from beginning to end, with a touching finale.",1330646400,,644,4.330578512396694
3129170,5,B0014C2FX8,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has striking similarities to Raiders of the Lost Ark, in that it has the familiar chase scenes, snakes, villians, and the quest for a religious artifact. This time, son and father meet up and together they search for the holy grail. Ford and Connery mesh well, and the movie is given a boost by their chemistry and humor. This movie has an adundance of action (as it should) and that coupled with humor and a great story allows for a great movie experience. River Phoenix just nails it as young Indy; his mannerisms were spot-on. In the end, father knows best, and Indy is in awe of his father's wit. For the record, this movie has great stunts, special effects, sound, and picture quality. I hope Lucas and Spielberg make one more movie, giving the franchise 5 movies in all.",1324598400,,811,4.561643835616438
3129171,5,B0014C2FX8,"The Last Crusade is, without a doubt, my favorite of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Harrison Ford's acting as Indy is superb, yet this film takes the added bonus that is Sean Connery as Indy's father. ""The Last Crusade"" is a story of intrigue and betrayal, as are the other Indiana Jones movies, yet the race against the Nazis in this film seems a race for humanity, as both Indy and the Nazis attempt to find the most treasured of all treasures: the Holy Grail. Indiana Jones is at his best in this race. The film has stunning action scenes as well as religious intrigue from the time of the Templars and the birth of Christianity.

The scenery, spanning Europe with the last section filmed at Petra, Jordan, is also stunning. The DVD edition exists not to have fancy special features, simply so that you can enjoy this classic as it was meant to be enjoyed as a tale for both old and young!",1310428800,,888,4.447852760736196
3129172,5,B0014C2FX8,"If Raiders was action-packed and Temple of Doom was scary, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is hilarious. It takes the original Indiana Jones formula and treats it irreverently. That's the genius of this film. Sean Connery as Indy's dad was brilliant casting. Having the former James Bond try to overshadow and outdo the son makes for both funny and emotionally touching moments.

The other characters stand out as well. The new Indy girl, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody) is both gorgeous and very complex. One is never sure of her loyalties, making her one of my favorite Indy girls of the entire series. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) was briefly seen in the first movie but now has a more prominent part as almost a source of comedic relief. Some of the best moments are his attempts to cope with Indy's adventure. Only Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), the expedition's funder, comes off as boring or less than meets the eye.

Aside from the humor, it's the moving father-son relationship that between Henry and Indiana Jones that really makes this fun to watch. Unlike Crystal Skull, which overdid the ""lost son"" angle, Last Crusade pulled just the right amount on the emotional chords. The two have a competitive relationship, but it never becomes melodramatic. The end is particularly poignant.

Aside from Raiders, this is easily the best of the Indiana Jones series, and definitely the funniest.",1309392000,,1406,4.974468085106383
3129173,4,B0014C2FX8,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989) is not as iconic as Raiders, but it's breezier than Temple of Doom. In 1938, Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford) travels to Europe to rescue his father. Together, they must stop The Nazis from getting to the Holy Grail. The Last Crusade plays it safe and sticks to the formula from the first film. John Williams wrote another superb music score; the music cue that he composed for Indiana's father is quite tender. Spielberg and Lucas succeeded in casting Sean Connery as Indy's father! Alison Doody(A View to a Kill) is quite good as a two-faced Austrian woman! The first 15 minutes of the film had the late River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones! This may have been the genesis of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles(1992, TV). Showing parents at odds with their children is shown in many Steven Spielberg movies. The Last Crusade does try to emulate Raiders by giving screen time to John Ryhs-Davies and Denholm Elliot. Many ideas from the Indiana Jones movies ended up in Universal's reboot of The Mummy franchise. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is my personal favorite of the Indy movies.",1307664000,,1135,4.855670103092783
3129174,3,B0014C2FX8,"This is a third-rate sort of film. It mostly served as a very expensive advertisement for the young indiana jones chronicals television series and a big payday for Sean Connery.

The film looks cheap. Compared to the first two films, it has the appearance of being done on a low budget. The sets are small and not very elaborate. The action sequeneces are minimal. And large stretches of the film are just boring. Connery is Indiana Jones father who is searching for the Holy Grail. Ford has to search for both the Grail and for his father. A lengthy ""young indiana jones"" seqeuence inserted into the film ends up cutting down the time devoted to the main plot. There is also a long pointless diversion into Hitler's germany.

Connery does little in the film. He is mostly there to be the stereotypical ""bad father"" who has enough prestige to be the father of Indiana Jones. Its not the worst Indiana Jones film and its not that its terrible. Its just not anywhere near the standard of the first two films.",1293494400,2,1006,4.583333333333333

3129177,5,B0014C2FX8,"If I had to choose a favorite Indy film, this is the one I would select immediately. The Last Crusade is without a doubt the best Indy film of all, even surpassing Raiders. It has the same formula as Raiders (the Nazis are here, Marcus & Sallah return, a Biblical artifact is being searched, etc.), but it has more action, more humor, and also a welcome addition to the entire franchise, which is Sean Connery as Henry Jones. Connery is perfect as Indy's father, and the chemistry between the two main leads is really enjoyable to watch. A few of the special effects shots may look a bit dated, but who cares? Last Crusade is the ultimate Indy film. Temple of Doom may be too dark, Crystal Skull may be too silly, Raiders is perfectly fine, but Last Crusade is the one that has the most. And it does its job really well: it entertains us in the most excellent way possible. A great action-adventure, indeed.

3129179,5,B0014C2FX8,"After the critical failure of ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"" director Steven Speilberg wisely chose a script that wasn't as dark and morbid as the second installment in the ""Indiana"" franchise. In this outing Indiana Jones (played by hunk Harrison Ford) searches for his father (starring James Bond himself, Sean Connery) who has been captured by the evil Nazis in the late 1930's. The story takes place in many locales including Italy and England. This movie is action packed, fast paced, excitingly directed, and at times even comedic. The chemistry between Ford and Connery is also evident as the viewer would actually think they are father and son. The movie was released in May, 1989 and went on to gross nearly $500,000,000 at the boxoffice becomg a certified hit. The film won the Oscar for Best Sound as well.

3129180,4,B0014C2FX8,"Its hard for me to review this movie as an adult.  I was a large fan of the Indiana Jones movie as a child growing up, and this was the only one of the original trilogy that I had the opportunity to see on the big screen, and I loved it.  It was very action packed and funny and never really let up.  It did capture the imagination of my child mind, but now watching it as an adult I have to say that the reason that it captures your imagination is that none of it is possible. The movie starts with a great introduction of Indiana as a teenager discovering ""evil grave robbers"" discover a historic cross, wait a second isn't that kinda what indy does his whole life, digging up historical artifacts, because as it is explained ""it belongs in a meuseum"".  It is with such broad stroke morality that the rest of the movie can be told.  In the special features it is discussed that this is really the one that Spielberg and Lucas made as a crowd pleaser.  The chase ends with a train pursuit where we learn in broad strokes where Indy's fear of snakes comes from and where he originally got his scar.  At the end of it, Indy is trapped at a locked kaboose with no way to escape, but wait, there are a lot of items used in a magic act laying about in the car, so Indy goes into a magic box and when the bad guys come in to find him, they open the box that desinigrates but with no trace of Indy.  Indy is then scene running outside the car, which by the way opens for the bad guys to better see Indy making his escape.  I remember from that era that magic was really popular, and really worked best on film as you could cut it together to make it look however you want, even though we know this is impossible for magic prop to transport indy outside of the car, its an effective film gag that leaves my adult self scratching my head.  Indy returns to his house where the police are waiting and take the cross back to the legal and rightful owners, cut to adult Indy, still searching after the cross, where he kills every one of the legal owners to take it back to a meusium.  Also notice that the lovable villain that gave Indy his trademark hat isn't on the boat that gets blown up.  So we learn about the grail then go to Venice to the most problematic scene of the movie.  The sewer made of gas.  Indy and his love interest are walking through said moat of petrol with torches that you can see pits of the tourch dropping off and falling still ablaze into the liquid.  The defenders of the grail discover Indy is looking for the grail and light the sewer.  Indy hides under the coffin that keeps them from burning up, looks underwater, i guess the liquid turned to water, cause gasoline would burn your eyes if you were swimming in it, and finds an exit to swim into the vinice sewer system.  Thats right, the petrol sewer under the library connects with the water based venice sewer, nulifying the need to go through the library to begin with, not to mention that the petrol would dilute with the water, and notice how as the defenders of the grail, when leaving the library, are in a dead sprint, as if they know Indy escaped, but its so faced paced, you really aren't supposed to ask questions.  I don't understand why Indy is let go after the boat chase.  We go to get his father from Austria, and I still don't understand why Indy goes through the window to avoid triggering the door alarm when after he reunites with his father, they leave through said door.  I don't see why the plain would go through the tunnel, makes no sense.  Also when on the blimp and the funny no ticket line that all the germans react to, when its not in german, and it would definately give Indy away as being an American.  There is the sign that says Venice this way, Berlin the other, like those are the only two points that are of any consequence in Austria.  The entire movie is driven to get to the stunt scenes, embrace the popular christian faith as to reinforce basic morality without becoming preachy as their is no substance to this movie, and show a humorous coming together between Indy and his father.  Nazi's are stupid and as Stevie says, its a get out of jail free card to abuse a Nazi.  Its broad strokes history that in retrospect Nazi's were bad, they burned books, Indy saved the day.  This is the worst of the original trilogy by far, and even though its not exactly a reality based series by any means, a lot of the solutions that are made in this movie are so impractical that it head scratching.  I do love the Sean Connery, especially his well now what do you want to talk about speach, or that they both diddled the same girl.  There is definately style in this movie, but I think the creator became too comfortable in that style and quit trying, not as bad as crystal skull which is unwatchable, but still very shallow film.  Great effects and do have to watch it without thinking too hard.  Great visuals.  Definately worth watching though, at least once.",1264809600,,4966,4.296137339055794

3129184,5,B0014C2FX8,"Spielberg was well inspired again and anew after the badly thought second episode and he brought his Indiana Jones back to the Nazi time and context. It's clear and some of the scenes, including the meeting with Adolf Hitler himself are sickeningly obnoxious and hilariously crystal clear: Hitler is evil, he burns books, he kills people, he enjoys it and he is surrounded by the scum of humanity. But Spielberg goes one iota further and introduces his version of the American Nazi and this one is worse than Adolf Hitler himself, he has no historical ambition or vision just plain personal and self centered egotistic interest. He is a Nazi out of pure opportunism and that is even worse evil than Nazism itself. But Spielberg gets to another dimension too by introducing Indiana Jones's father and Sean Connery does quite a credible father of that crazy adventurer, or should I say adventuring archaeology professor. But one improvement is never enough for our Spielberg and this time the main woman is an evil traitor, a Nazi that prefers dying to letting the prey of her hunt go, even when it is obviously too late and out of reach. And that prey is the Holy Grail, mind you. This time the myth is a good western myth, Christian what's more. And this myth needs a delicate treatment but has immense possibilities for us and these possibilities are used right to the end. So we discover the underground catacombs of Venice and their rats, a good old chase on a train transporting a circus and all its animals, a sacred temple in Jordan and all kinds of religious symbols and traps, and the winners are those who believe in and respect these symbols, and that has to be Indiana Jones and his father. Too bad for all the others: the treasure hunter who takes the most beautiful and golden chalice and dies on the spot after drinking from it, the greedy woman who disappears in the depth of the earth, and all the other bad guys and bad boys. Some scene are superb like the crazy German tank in the desert. Every detail is hilarious and suspenseful and even a second viewing, or probably even more, is as effective as the first one. Very well inspired indeed this time, this famous Spielberg, but since he made Dr Jones Senior drink the water of eternal life in the Holy Grail itself, he is doomed to go on and on with that legend. The fourth episode has already been produced and Harrison Ford has just announced a few days ago he was ready to get into the adventure of a fifth episode, now he has been provided with a son in this fourth episode: he has to guide the new Junior into the next stage of the quest.

3129193,4,B0014C2FX8,"After preventing the Nazis from gaining control of the all-powerful Ark of the Covenant, and freeing slave children from an oppressive cult, Indiana Jones is back once again for yet another thrilling adventure. Series star Harrison Ford returns as the title character, along with John Rhys-Davies reprising his role of Sallah from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and new to the series we have the original James Bond himself, Sean Connery (""007: Goldfinger"") as Indy's long lost archaeologist father. With two highly successful films already established in the series, the third one would no doubt enthrall fans to some degree, but would the quality of the first two films remain intact all the way through the third; or has Indiana Jones finally met his match?

Upon receiving disturbing news that his father, Professor Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) has gone missing while on his lifelong quest to discover the Holy Grail; Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) embarks upon a search to save his estranged father from the clutches of some familiar enemies... the Nazis. Assisted by his loyal friends Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott), Indy will do everything within his power to save his father, stop the Nazis once again, and maybe even discover the resting place of the mystical Holy Grail in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".

After the success of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", I'm somewhat surprised, when looking back, by the five year gap between the second and third movies. Especially when in numerous interviews, director Steven Spielberg has stated that he felt that ""Temple of Doom"" was kind of a letdown to audiences and was far too dark of a picture, and that he wanted to make another adventure to sort of redeem the character and himself. I guess one could make the argument that by not rushing into a third film, Spielberg and co-creator/producer George Lucas could avoid making another movie that would be viewed as a disappointment in at least their eyes, and perhaps even in the eyes of fans and critics. I just thought Spielberg would have pushed for a little faster turnaround in regards to the supposed redemption of the series; instead of waiting five years to do so, but that's me and I'm not in charge.

Apparently throughout the five year lull between sequels, both Spielberg and Lucas, along with writer Jeffrey Boam (""Lethal Weapon 2""), took advantage of the time and were able to create what I believe to be the absolute best Indiana Jones adventure yet. The concept of linking the quest for the Holy Grail to Indy's quest to prove himself to his father was a very strong backbone with which to base this newest adventure. This approach allowed for some really interesting, and at times incredibly fun, moments within the film for the actors, and the team behind the camera, to mine for cinematic gold.

One of the major strong points this film has working in its favor is the smartly written banter between Indy and his father, with both of them constantly trying to get the last word in on any topic. Plus, it's intriguing to see that everything Indiana has done, his father has most likely done, and in his own opinion, has done it better; so for Indy, we get a sense that he feels as if he's constantly living in his father's shadow, which becomes a major source of contention for the father/son duo. I also enjoyed the return of the Nazis as a villain for the series, the Thuggee cult in the second film was good, but the Nazis were a much more lethal threat, and given the time in which the films are set, they seemed an appropriate choice for Indy to tackle. Lastly, the tease at the beginning of the film that introduced us to a young, inexperienced Indiana Jones was very refreshing, and provided some neat bits of exposition regarding Indy's fear of snakes, his code of honor in regards to tomb raiding, and even went so far as to explain the scar on his chin. All of these little moments early on in the film, coupled with several more that were sprinkled throughout, just added to the overall enjoyment I had with this movie experience.

Harrison Ford really surprised me by his ability to bring even more depth to a character that he's already played twice. With this being the third time Harrison played this role, I would have thought that he had done all he could with this character, and if his father hadn't been introduced into the series, then perhaps there would have been no new ground to cover. Thanks to that addition, Harrison was given some new areas of Indy's life and personality to explore, allowing for the character to not only remain fresh for him, but also for the audience that has followed him throughout all his adventures. Just to clarify, even if Harrison was unable to really cover any new ground with the character; that would have been fine too, so long as this movie was to be intended as the final chapter in the character's franchise. Because once a character quits growing/evolving, the audience will quickly lose interest, due to it being more of the same old thing, and the actor playing the part will most likely feel the exact same way; therefore resulting in a sub-par performance and inferior sequel.

Joining Harrison Ford on his quest we find a few familiar faces, such as John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Indiana's trusted ally in Cairo. I was pleased to see Sallah's return to the series, after feeling like there was much more that could have been done with the character in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Also returning was actor Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody, Indy's close friend and associate; actually he seems more like a manager when it comes to his various archaeological adventures, but let's not split hairs. Joining the cast is screen legend Sean Connery, who brings Indy's father to life in all his cantankerous, scene chewing glory. As terrific as the dynamic between father and son proved to be in this film, Sean never ceased to steal every scene he was in, even when Harrison was at the top of his game matching Sean quip for quip. As great as Sean was in the role, one thing did bug me about his casting. Although he did attempt to hide it, his accent was still apparent in several scenes. Yet for some reason, no one ever made note of it. I guess we were just supposed to ignore it, but I for one would have liked some form of explanation for why he has an accent that his son clearly has no hint of. This doesn't seem like too far-fetched of a request, especially when the writer was going so far as to explain why Indy has a scar on his chin and even where he got the nickname Indiana from in the first place. Maybe I'm the only one that's had this thought; and if so, I guess that's fine, but it just struck me as odd was all.

If director Steven Spielberg was hoping to redeem himself with ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", for what he felt was a failure with his previous effort in the series; then, I would have to say he has succeeded brilliantly. I agree that the darker tone of ""Temple of Doom"" did feel different from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but I also felt that it was a natural progression for the character and the series (generally the middle chapter is the darkest); that being said, I was happy that this movie was more in line with the tone of the original film. Even though the tone for this movie was similar to that of the first, there is one major difference between this film and its predecessors; this one seemed like it was done much better, and felt more polished than either of the previous two ever came close to being.

Overall, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is a great sequel, and for me, it is the best the series has ever been. Loaded with great storytelling, terrific acting, some truly touching moments, and even some hilarious ones, this is one movie that is definitely worth watching.

""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",1225497600,,7944,4.636363636363637
3129194,5,B0014C2FX8,"As the title so prominently mentions, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE was originally intended to be the last of the Indiana Jones film series.  The movie is an origins story and fills in many of the questions that fans had about the character, e.g. where did Indy get his scar, where did he get his whip, why is he afraid of snakes, etc.

The extended opening of the film begins in Utah where Indy (played by River Phoenix here) and his Boy Scout troop are out for a day of riding and exploring.  Indy and a fellow Scout separate from the group and stumble upon a group of men who have just discovered the Cross of Coronado.  Indy believes the object belongs in a museum, while the men just want the fortune the find will bring.  Indy steals the cross and the diggers chase after him.  It's a race through the rough terrain that climaxes aboard a circus train.

After explaining some of Indy's origins, the film fast forwards to 1938.  Indy (now once again played by Harrison Ford) is hired by a wealthy ""collector of antiquities"" to find the missing pieces of a map that reveal the resting place of the Holy Grail.  He learns that is father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) has already gone missing in the quest.  In order to find his father, Indy takes the quest.  The journey takes Indy from Italy, Austria, and the Middle East.  The Nazis are once again the villains and are intent on adding another spiritual artifact to their growing collection as preparation for their attempt of world domination.

Out of all the Indiana Jones films, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is my favorite. The film has some wonderful acting, particularly by River Phoenix in the opening segment and by Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in the rest of the picture.  Ford and Connery have a great rapport between each other and their relationship grounds the picture in reality.  The movie is chock-full of action.  I also like how the film brought back the characters of Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott).  There is some criticism of the character of Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), but the beautiful and conflicted Schneider makes a perfect female foil for Indy in the movie.

INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is sometimes criticized for being less realistic in its action sequences than the two previous films and having too much physical comedy.  The movie is lighter in tone than the previous two films in the franchise, but that doesn't make it any less realistic nor does it overshadow the serious journey that Indy, his father, and their companions are on.  Continuing a theme that was hinted at in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is a film that despite the action and humor is really about renewal and redemption.  It's a movie that when the final credits roll at the end a person can sit back and really feel like they have found ""illumination.""",1222560000,,2908,4.651663405088063

This is a very entertaining sequel with all the goods like great acting especially from the late River Phoenix and John Rhys-Davis as Sallah, fantastic special effects like the amazing death of Donovan, action, a little romance and of course humor.

This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with good extras like an introduction by Spielburg and Lucas, three featurettes, photo galleries and a DVD-rom PC Lego Indiana Jones demo.",1213747200,2,1251,4.813953488372093
3129198,5,B0014C2FX8,"The Last Crusade recaptured the fun and excitement of the first Indiana Jones movie with a father son pair-up that is both genius and funny.  James Bond and Indiana Jones together...now there's a dynamic duo!  What is especially ironic is that Spielberg was inspired to have a cloak and dagger plot in the Indiana Jones series that was born from a love the James Bond films.

Harrison Ford brings Indiana Jones back to life with an amazing performance. But this time we get to see a bit of the little boy who is trying to impress his father.  A couple of the most enjoyable parts of the movie are when Indiana does something that he is proud of and looks to his father for approval...only to gets a look of disdain!

Sean Connery has always been one of my favorite actors ever since the early days of Bond. A true mans man and a ladies man. He seems to be as comfortable in a suit as wresting in the mud.  Connery gives a stunning performance in the Last Crusade as a driven man in search of the Holy Grail who deeply loves his son, but as with many fathers, is clumsy at expressing that love.  One of the great lines of the movie came when Connery confronts his son about the origin of his adventurous name when he says in typical Connery fashion: ""The dogs name was Indiana!""

There are many memorable scenes.  We get to find out why Indy hates snakes. In the opening of the movie the young Indy (played by River Phoenix) falls into a circus train car full of snakes...and hates them ever after.  Who can blame him!  Another memorable scene is when Indiana comes face to face with Hitler (at a rally in Berlin) who signs the critical journal Indy is holding.

The plot is about a quest for the Holy Grail that has incalculable value and magical powers to bring long...long life.  The plot twists and turns, frightens and delights as our heroes get closer to the final prize.  In one of the final twists of the plot Indian must ""Choose Wisely"" to save his father's life and not losing his own!

Overall a great addition to the Indiana Jones collection!

3129199,2,B0014C2FX8,"For some reason, unbeknownst to me, quite a few people (and reviewers) dismissed the excellent ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (also reviewed) as the worst sequel in the original 80's Indy series and some said it was just simply a bad film...full stop. They derided the film so much that I wondered if they had actually seen it at all, so unjust was the ""outrage"" against the episode. Obviously, the fact that ""Temple of Doom"" was following the truly wonderful ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (the only really great film of the 4) had a negative effect on how some were going to view the first sequel in the series, as no matter how hard Lucas and Spielberg et al tried they couldn't hope to top the incredible impact that ""Raiders"" had on the public.

But unfortunately, it seems that the producers of the Indy series abandoned their own judgment and bent over backwards in an attempt to eliminate the darker elements of ""Temple of Doom"" and replace it with lashings of incredibly stupid and inane comedy for the third installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".

So vehement were the producers of ""Last Crusade"" to replace serious content with appalling idiocy, they were willing to litter the movie with slapstick nonsense that destroyed the overall film.

Of course, that doesn't mean that the film is a complete write off in every department. The basic story is OK (but only just) and sees our hero following in his fathers obsessive quest for the famed cup of Christ, or the Holy Grail. The essential plot elements are all there and includes the usual Indy staples of multiple locations, deadly traps and spectacular supernatural McGuffin. Even the Germans were forced back into their nazi uniforms to don their traditional Hollywood caricature as the badguys; Which, in my opinion was a bit tired and un-necessary. There are plenty of bad folk around and their presentation here is far, far inferior than their turn in ""Raiders"".

Most in the movies favor, and the only reason this film gets an extra star, is the inclusion of Sean Connery as Indy's dad. It's a good plot device to hang the kinda weak central plot onto and Connery's performance as the bungling Old Man of Henry Jones Jr is quite delightful and he has some great lines too...""We named the dog Indiana"".

The shared screen time of Ford and Connery generally works well and they pair of them seemed to be having a good time in their roles.

Another mention should go to Irish actress Alison Doody, as the obligatory squeeze (with a twist) and Denholm Elliott who reprises his charming role as Marcus Brody, dean of Indy's college in America. Unfortunately, it was to be for the last time.

Also of note, is a floppy haired River Phoenix as a young Indiana in the movies brilliant opening sequence.

Unfortunately, after the opening is complete, the film starts to go rapidly downhill until it naturally reaches it's ridiculously absurd climax, by which time my suspension of disbelief had had enough and Mr Cynicism had stepped in.

But even the rapidly disintegrating story would have been bearable if Spielberg and Lucas had refrained from carelessly dropping the incredibly unfunny attempts at ""humour"" through the film. Sure, the two preceding efforts had liberal amounts of humour sprinkled within it's opening and ending credits, but it remained subtle and never interfered with the overall product or the ""seriousness"" of the piece. In ""Raiders"" Indy shoots the sword wielding foe with his revolver, instead of fighting him with a sword and in ""Temple of Doom"" he tries it again, but this time his gun has been missing since the opening sequence. These humourous efforts are fine and funny and what's more they are limited to reality. They don't break down the walls of reality and destroy the suspense or action of a given scene.

Whereas the ""humour"" in the ""Last Crusade"" is so heavy handed that it completely ruins a scene. For instance, when Indy breaks his way through a library floor in Venice to get to a secret chamber, the noise he naturally makes breaking the floor is mistaken by a librarian for the noise he makes while he is stamping overdue books. Now, this may be fine in a Monty Python movie, but in a film such as an Indy adventure, it is just stupid. There's no other words for it. It ruins the suspense of the scene.

Likewise the ""No Ticket"" scene in the Zeppelin and the ridiculous Berlin book burning scene where Indy meets Hitler, coupled with the scene where the BF108 pilot sheers his wings off and continues traveling down a tunnel beside a car containing the Jones boys go a long way towards tearing apart any suspension of disbelief that's required equipment for watching a film of this sort. It's unbelievably groan making, destroys the suspense and danger and it's difficult to imagine anyone finding it enjoyable.

At it's conclusion ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" has long since revealed itself another 'could have been' film. It could have been great, but it's let down terribly by the decision to dilute the overall effect with mind numbing idiocy and it kills any excitement with dreadful foot stamping comedy that even a Will Ferrell movie would scoff at.",1211846400,6,5185,4.787472035794184

3129201,3,B0014C2FX8,"I couldn't decide whether to give this movie a two star or a three star rating.  It is infinitely better than 1984's dreary TEMPLE OF DOOM but still way, way behind 1981's awesome RAIDERS.

What I've never liked about the Indiana Jones sequels is the consistency of the main character.  In RAIDERS, his character was perfect: a humble but passionate scholar in the classroom and a two-fisted, determined adventurer everywhere else.  No hint of ego, only drive and even obsession about the next great find.

In TEMPLE OF DOOM, he's first seen in a Shanghai nightclub in a tux like he's James Bond.  The rest of that movie is too much of a train wreck to even pay attention to him after that.

In THE LAST CRUSADE, he starts off well enough...but then there are silly scenes that take away from the movie's overall tension.  The ""Ah, Venice"" lines took away from why Indy was in Venice in the first place: he smiles and says ""Ah, Venice"" upon arrival--as if completely forgetting that his father's been kidnapped--and then reads some silly lines before ending up on the floor with the Fraulien before ending the sequence with, ""Ah, Venice.""  Nice device...in another movie.  In LAST CRUSADE, it felt like Indy forgot just what he was in Venice for in the first place.

Then having Indy show up at the castle doing a really bad Scottish accent was just schtick and, again, drained a lot of tension.  Look at how the humor in RAIDERS never took away from the overall momentum and tightening of the tension in the story and you'll see what I mean.

The action sequences were also a far cry from the first film.  The Nazi fighter plane zipped around like an X-wing from a STAR WARS movie.  The big tank sequence didn't have any of the unpredictability and energy of the main chase in RAIDERS (didn't it look obviously staged that Indy is dragging along a completely straight wall alongside the tank, coming close to a suspiciously squared block at the end of it?).  Both of the sequels appeared to have too many special effects and not enough spontaneity in their action set pieces.

I was also disappointed that they chose to play Marcus Brody as a bumbling oaf and Sallah became more of an Arab caricature than ever.

But I won't be completely negative.  Some of it worked.  Sean Connery was great as Dr. Henry Jones Sr. and his scenes with Harrison Ford made the movie.  The Holy Grail was a much weaker storyline than the Ark of the Covenant but it was still so much better than the glowing rocks from TEMPLE OF DOOM.

Yes, these movies are about having fun--but they're much funner when the characters DON'T look like they're having fun too.

I still gotta go with RAIDERS as the only great Indiana Jones movie.  I hope this new one coming out next week is good!",1210636800,3,2761,4.565040650406504

The new releases will coincide with the new movie, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which comes out on May 22nd.  They'll have new special features designed to introduce new Indy fans to the old movies, as well as to introduce old fans to the new movie.

The Indiana Jones movies are George Lucas's recreation/update of the serialized adventures of the 1930s and '40s.  Made in the '80s and set in the '30s, they feature Harrison Ford as a mild-mannered archeology professor who moonlights as an adventurous seeker of priceless antiquities.  This takes him to exotic locations across the world, and gets him in some very tight spots of the kind that only a movie hero could get into, or out of.  He invariably finds himself opposed by dangerous men with evil plans for the powerful objects only he has the skills to recover.  There are elaborate set pieces with creepy critters, ancient traps, fights with weapons from bare hands to airplanes and tanks, and sometimes supernatural forces.  Along the way Jones manages to have some romance too.  Humor is a big part of the fun.

This is the third in the series, after Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  It begins with a teenaged Indy trying unsuccessfully to save an artifact from thieves, during which we get background on his signature fedora, bull whip, fear of snakes and his father.  Then we jump to 1938, when Indy learns his father, played by Sean Connery, has gone missing while searching for the Holy Grail, which the Nazis have designs on for world domination.  Joining with a somewhat dim museum owner and the beautiful woman Indy's father had been working with, Indy has close calls in Venice, Austria, and Turkey as he closes in on the Grail and, in the end, bonds with dad.

This one returns to the lighter tone of Raiders, after the somewhat darker Temple of Doom, and perhaps exceeds Raiders in its emphasis on humor (though I still find Raiders funnier).  It's fun to see Ford and Connery working together.  As always there are very involved set pieces, including a tank battle, an intricate plot full of mystery and action, and some magic.  And critters: this time thousands of rats.

If you don't want the whole set and don't want to wait until May, you could get a used copy of the old Last Crusade DVD (people sell them out of the sets).  The difference is in the extra features.  The bonuses from the old set are on their own disc, so what you get when you buy just the old Last Crusade DVD is pretty bare.  The new release, on the other hand, has the following, all new:

-- ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: An Introduction"" by director Steven Spielberg and creator/producer George Lucas

-- ""The Women: The American Film Institute Tribute,"" in which the three Indiana Jones women (Karen Allen, Kate Capshaw and Alison Doody) reunite for a discussion

-- ""Friends and Enemies,"" in which Spielberg, Lucas and Indiana Jones writers discuss how they created the original characters, and a look at new faces in the new movie

-- storyboards: the opening sequence

-- DVD galleries of illustrations, props, production stills and portraits, FX/Industrial Light and Magic stuff, and promotion/marketing materials

-- ""Lego Indiana Jones,"" a demo and trailer for a game based on the trilogy

If you like a few extras, you'll probably prefer this new DVD, though maybe not enough to upgrade from the old one, or to wait until May.  I like audio commentaries, myself, and since they're easy to produce and tend to bring out points not covered in other features, I subtract one star for a special edition without any, but I look forward to the rest.  If you don't care about commentaries, this may be a five-star DVD for you.

There have been rumors of deleted scenes, but none are included.

Some will want to wait for a high-def release, which makes sense if you have the equipment or plan to get it.  Many speculate that a Blu-ray release will come out for Christmas, but that's sheer guesswork.

There's also some speculation that an even better edition with all four movies will soon supersede this new DVD.  They may bundle the four together, but I doubt that there will be a better edition of this movie soon, if ever, on standard DVD.  Keep in mind that the previous set came out over four years ago, and if not for the new movie, that would probably be the only release during the decade of standard DVD.  The next upgrade may be high-def only, and may not happen for a while.

If you do want the whole trilogy (highly recommended), the new release is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B0014Z4ONE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>, the old set is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B00003CXC5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>.

3363494,4,B0014C2FX8,"RELEASED IN 1989 and directed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has Jones (Harrison Ford) globetrotting for the Holy Grail and, along the way, teaming up with his father (Sean Connery). Alison Doody plays an Austrian colleague of the latter.

After the cartoony farce of Temple of Doom (1984), Spielberg went back to the blueprint of Raiders of the Last Ark (1981) to make this third film in the franchise. The problem is that, while good in many ways, Last Crusade is second-rate by comparison. Raiders copped the perfect tone for this kind of adventure flick: Quasi-realistic with a fun, kinetic edge. As wild as the actions scenes in Raiders were, most of them were later reenacted on a TV show in order to see if they were plausible, and they were!

Unfortunately, Last Crusade mixed the plot of Raiders with the silliness of Temple and so many of the action sequences smack more of a cartoon than reality. The escape from the zeppelin in the parasite biplane is a good example. Then theres the silly bickering and bumbling of father and son, like when they're tied-up in the castle or facing the Nazis in (what is now) Turkey.

Thankfully, there are eventually some good scenes between the two, which shed insight on them and their troubled relationship. And the globetrotting is great, starting with Arches National Park, then Venice, an Austrian-German castle, Berlin and Turkey. While cartoony and second-rate (compared to Raiders), the action sequences are often fun and thrilling. And the striking Doody is fine on the female front. Some critics wrote her character off as a blonde bimbo, but this is inexplicable seeing as how shes palpably intelligent and sophisticated. Regrettably, the climax is overlong and curiously dull despite its attempt at spiritual profoundness.

THE MOVIE RUNS 127 minutes and was shot in Arches National Park, Utah; Hertfordshire, England; Venice, Italy;  Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany; London & other places in England; numerous locations in Spain; Colorado; Amarillo, Texas; New Mexico; and Petra, Jordan. WRITERS: Jeffrey Boam wrote the script from the story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes.

3363495,5,B0014C2FX8,"I have no idea what kind of restoration was necessary, but it was successful. Picture and sound were absolutely in synch throughout, and as clear as I remember from when I first saw the production. The story itself, of course, is a slam-bang adventure.",1504915200,,252,4.75
3363496,5,B0014C2FX8,"It may just be coincidence but this time Harrison Ford that was a carpenter is not Dr. Indiana Jones (Junior) and his last crusade (until the next film) is to obtain a cup of a carpenter.

Even though this film can stand on its own, it can be more fully understood if you watch ""Raiders of the lost Ark"" first.

Once again we start out with a young Jones trying to save an artifact from pillagers. This lets us know of his heroic energy and introduces his father Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery) and his obsession with the Holy Grail, even to the exclusion of his relationship with Junior.

Now grown Dr. Indiana Jones gives a class and explains that Archeology is a pretty strait forward science and not some search for legends. He receives a mysterious piece of post.

He is then approached by group of rich people that are in search of the Grail. It turns out that their top researcher has disappeared. Yep it is Professor Henry Jones. What can Indiana do but go looking for his father. He is accounted by his best friend who runs a museum Dr. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliottt) as they team up with the last person to see his father Dr. Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody.) He gets a final warning ""Do not trust anybody.""

Will he find his father?
If he dies what will they have to talk about?
Does the Grail really exist?
Who are the mysterious people following him?

One of my favorite scenes is where Dr. Jones disguised in a German uniform bumps into Hitler (Michael Sheard of Star Wars fame).

Have fun watching this great film with the banter between Hennery and Junior. And remember ""do not trust anybody.""",1504828800,,1612,4.5

3363542,4,B0014C2FX8,"I just spent far too much time reading hundreds of these reviews.  Some of the ""bad"" reviews are a bit surprising.
I remember seeing THE LAST CRUSADE in 1989 working as a young college student part time in a Cleveland Heights movie theater.  The ""Indiana"" movie remained at theater for months as other (movies) came and went (only 2 screens).  The consensus was:  Not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark but thank god it was better than The Temple of Doom.  The easy majority seemed to like Indy was battling the ""evil"" Nazis (cartoon cliche) again and no longer had to deal with the just plain silly, haha gross-out, eating eyes and bugs at the dinner party has nothing to do with story scene (in Temple of Doom), for example, while welcoming the mystical, magical, biblical chase to find ""The ArK"" in one and ""The Grail"" in the other.  What was the purpose of Temple of Doom?  Pulse-beating heart ripped-out of chest was memorable in the, uh, mind control scene ... ok.
Anyways, I purchased INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE because it was funny with addition of Connery as dad (and Not a James Bond Type character).  The Young Indy intro (with River Phoenix) is great with snakes explanation.  The blond Austrian femme fatale to be (sort of) is very (Aryan) attractive.  Greed and power and Eternal Life are prevailing themes.  Just about every crowd that I can recall (back in theater in 1989) loved the ""guardians"" line ""He chose ... pooorly"".  Laughs aplenty
The LAST CRUSADE had a great, fun supernatural ending (yeah, Denholm Eliot's character got a bit too oafish, even almost falls off horse at end, haha ... but Kate Capshaw was almost annoyingly worse in ""The Doom"" ... a thankless role in hindsight...?).
Extra interviews with some cast (not Ford) are ok as is the ""Enemies of Indy"" which is a little better than ok.
10 bucks?  Seems like a simple choice to watch INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE, again.

3363586,2,B0014C2FX8,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, 1989 film

It begins in a desert where young men on horses ride. They find men digging in a cave. [Plausible?] There is a chase, cars after a horse rider. Young Indy Jones hops a circus train to get away, those men follow. Back home the Sheriff meets him to retrieve that gold cross for its rightful owner. [Think about this.] Years later in the Portuguese Coast (1938) Jones found that gold cross again. It belongs in a museum. [Does this advocate public ownership over private ownership?] Jones jumps overboard with the cross. Back at a college Jones teaches a class on Archaeology, the search for facts. Men meet him to take him to meet Mr. Donovan. His mining for copper found a stone about the Holy Grail. Jones goes to search for this fabled item. First they reach Venice. They search the basement. Somebody searched their rooms.

There is a sinister plot against them. [No mention of the politics of that day.] They visit Baron Grunwalds castle. There is secret activities there. Indy breaks into a room and learns what is there. Junior talks to his Dad. Armed men enters, Indy neutralized them. Then he meets his assistant, who is threatened by a Nazi. You should have listened to your father she says. How did he know she was a Nazi? But pages are torn out of that book. There is more action in Turkey, Marcus went on ahead. Will he get away? [Father and son in love with the same woman? Thats something for the Gerry Stringer Show!] Then there is a fire in the room. [This is played like a farce.] They find a secret door to escape in a motorcycle and side car. There is another chase. Accidents befoul their pursuers. They must recover the diary to find three clues, so they go to Berlin. We see book burning and parades. [Recognize those three uniformed men? All will become suicides.]

Does a bonfire at night have an emotional effect? Indy retrieves the book. Der Fuehrer gives his autograph! Jones father and son plan to fly away on a Zeppelin. One military man does not have a ticket! [No radio contact?] Jones rebukes his father about his upbringing. What can they talk about? The three riddles. As the Zeppelin turns back they must escape. Then a fighter airplane attacks with its machine guns. Their car enters a tunnel, so too that fighter airplane! But another follows. Dad uses his umbrella as a defense! [Comedy?] The Republic of Hatay has a ruler who makes a deal with the Germans, who have Brody and the map, and a WW I tank.

Some protest the invasion for awhile. Indy borrows some horses and is pursued. [More comic scenes.] There is a fight on that tank and inside. Indy is saved! The tank hits the end of the road! And Indy? Hes alive. The Germans follow the map to the canyon of the Crescent Moon. A building is carved into a sandstone cliff. The four are captured! Does a gun produce power? Indy is offered a choice - find the Holy Grail to save his Dads life! Indy solves the three riddles. There is a guardian. Which is the true grail? An error is deadly. Indy chooses wisely, his Dad is saved. Elsa steps backwards and something happens! They escape falling rocks to leave. [Long shots for stunt doubles?]

This movie has  a lot of action but little of a realistic story. A Medieval legend of a Holy Grail is a weak structure to support a story. The Maltese Falcon was a hook to display greed and its foolish consequences, a more believable story. Dont question the plausibility of some of the scenes. CGI can do a lot for a movie. The plot is used to support action, not the other way around. You can compare it to other movies like The Fugitive or some war movies like A Walk in the Sun.",1426464000,,3659,4.470059880239521

3363588,1,B0014C2FX8,"The purchase was a bod one.  I've never received any DVD from this vendor that offered anything but good quality.  It was advertised as ""new"" and I didn't mind paying a bit more for the free Prime two-day delivery.  When I saw and felt the box in which my ""special 20th edition"" arrived I said ""uh oh"".  I've never, quite frankly, knowingly purchased a pirated anything, but the box was made of a material that was barely better than the cello covering some action figure, and the ""skeleton"" of the box was made of the same material which would give next to no protection.  I showed it to my son who promptly said ""hmmmmm"" in his sage, knowing way.  The disc itself was very thin and flimsy and (here's the kicker) DID NOT PLAY.

I purchased all three of the Indiana Jones classic and after trying the frist one, I didn't bother with the other two.

I'm trying to send them back, but Fex Ex hasn't contacted me to schedule the pick up.

3363612,3,B0014C2FX8,"Following the rigid but right hellspawn that was (my favorite entry in the series) ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", the third installment in the Jones trilogy remains watchable but by no means anything else but a nearly complete compromise. If you are one who merely watches movies and cares nothing about how they are made (if you are a person who merely eats what's inside of the sandwich without inspecting it first), then you will give this title a strong notice, and probably find it entertaining; however, if you are aware of any part of the complicated history concerning this script (who we kidding folks, it was a lot of scripts!) then you may want to hesitate before you click that five star button. As a fan of Dr. Jones, I find the third one interesting, certainly amusing, but it's not really an Indiana Jones movie, and that bothers me. The original attempts (by writers Chris Colombus, and Diane Thomas, respectively) actually had the film going in the right direction, but then Lucas and Spielberg (in their watered down refusal to return to the bowels of fun but nasty-minded terror on display in the first two movies) decided to hire ""Funny Farm"" scribe Jeffrey Boam to ""family-proof"" the story and this, in turn, destroyed what was (for me) the fun aspects of an Indiana Jones screen adventure (Boam, though a quality screenwriter, did not seem to understand the danger/mercenary nature of the Jones character at all). What viewers are left with, then, is retread and repeat; the AMAZON editorial claims that this film is closer to the James Bond-oriented tribute that the series was initially intended to be, but even though Connery himself is on board here, it all feels too light, too homage-heavy, and too labored to be really effective. While ""...Temple of Doom"" simply offered slam-bang fantasy, ""...Last Crusade"" toys with the public's mental stability by committing the impardonable sin of actually giving the dumb beast what it wants, and therefore the movie is neither intellectually honest nor seamless but instead a genuine effort to remain more ""realistic."" I don't know about you, but I don't watch Indiana Jones for realism, but rather for fantasy. I shouldn't have to re-open my class to explain that fantasy does not have to include dragons and demons in order to be genuine fantasy in terms of literary (or cinematic) concept, but oh well. The movie was made and that's that. If you like it, you must like it for a reason, but I think there's too much unnecessary humor, too little mayhem and carnage (I don't mean gore), and far too few opportunities to pay tribute to the overly fantastic pulp magazines and movie serials which were the true inspirations for this character and his films. Harrison Ford does his usual immaculate job as the character, but the movie is cowardly, weak in the plot department, and too afraid that it will offend its audience. If Spielberg wants to make a weepy movie about a father-and-son relationship, he should do it elsewhere, and not tamper with the legacy of a great adventure/horror/action movie character (and again, even though ""...Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" took its usual lashings from the all-knowing critics (yeah right), it remains more true, more focused, and more fun than anything on display in this one.
As for the DVD, however, it looks terrific, and it sounds amazing. I have not yet looked into the BluRay transfers, but they are apparently pristine as well. Unfortunately, however, if you are purchasing these newer DVD releases, just be aware that the bonus content is pretty lacking compared to the older box set, which housed three or four really useful (for historians) documentaries on the making of the original Indiana Jones films. All that's included here is a neat (but far too brief) summary of both Lucas's and Spielberg's emotions concerning the making and release of this title. They are, as always, fun to hear from, but they offer little insight in comparison with the older DVD-issues' making of features. Anyway, though, an easy A for picture and sound transfer. But I have to grant the movie a C+ if anything...it's simply too much of a compromise to warrant a strong recommendation.",1411948800,2,4202,4.894810659186536

3363620,1,B0014C2FX8,"INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE (1989) plays like a silly, slapstick comedy, not an Indiana Jones film. For all the of the so-called ""kids movie"" qualities that ""Temple of Doom"" possesses, that movie actually had a more serious overall tone and dark theme than this third film in the franchise. The stunt casting of Connery as Ford's father fails to deliver as they have ZERO chemistry. Their ""relationship"" consists of one-liner after one-liner, like a (INSERT ANY RANDOM COMEDY DUO) routine. Do most people really think these actors possessed natural chemistry? Their every interaction felt forced. Counter this with the more naturally fluid interactions between Ford and his co-stars Allen, Capshaw, and Quan from the previous films. I think the fact that 2 mega-stars were paired was detrimental here. Better to have a lesser-known actor. Maybe more tolerable dialogue would have been given the actors! There is SO much genuine humor in the earlier movies and NONE in this one.

The effects are pretty stale, too. they look amazingly fake and don't hold up as they do in the two preceding, superior films of the franchise. I know it's summer action adventure, but in the previous movies, there was a grit and edge to the action scenes that seemed almost real, whereas here, the action scenes in Crusade play like a pre-cursor to all of the over-the-top, unconvincing, CGI action scenes that have flooded 21st century summer movies. Somehow, in the first 2 films, Spielberg staged the action convincingly. Here, the action scenes just feel STAGED.

And the plot? Nazis again, just like the first one. But the villains here have no panache or personality to speak of. Just a bunch of disposable, insultingly dumb, evil characters. The lead female, a gorgeous blonde, is completely forgettable. I think the Indiana Jones films prove the axiom that beauty seems to be inversely proportional to talent. Karen Allen and Kate Capshaw got nothin on this lady in terms of looks, but completely overshadow her in terms of being able to emote and act! Not nearly enough negative reviews of this horrific ""Indy"" movie.",1404432000,2,2113,5.0

I liked that they returned to an action packed format for this third film, which is more in keeping with the serials they were trying to emulate.  It also helped that they welcomed back old friends (Denholm Elliott as the ever baffled Dr. Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah), and gave them bigger roles to play.  Unfortunately, they were still off the mark with the female interest, Alison Doody as Dr. Schneider.  From one extreme to the other, they created this damsel with no bite or backbone.  She came off as mere window dressing, very little in the way of personality.  Thank goodness, they got someone substantial to play Indiana's father (Sean Connery).  Without this pairing, the movie wouldn't have worked as well as it did.  Overloaded with action sequences, the best involved a tank and the persistence of Indiana (Ford) plus a rather nasty Nazi.  Hitler even does a cameo!  There's a lot to recommend in this third installment in the franchise.  Better dialog, great music, so much action, and a decent finale.  This film definitely helps take away the bad taste of film number two.",1370649600,,1373,4.913043478260869

3363664,5,B0014C2FX8,"The third in a series of Indiana Jones films, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is a testament to the team of Harrison Ford and Sean Connery who provide us with two hours of entertainment on a grand scale, thanks to some fine direction from Steven Spielberg and a rollicking good script. The duo exchange some lively banter in a believable way, bringing more depth to both characters and making us care more about the adventures of the world's most beloved archaeologist.

Keeping the Holy Grail out of the clutches of the Nazis is what makes the story click from the start, with adventures that range from sea to desert to majestic mountain hideaways, all while Indy and his dad are hotly pursued by the Nazis anxious to get their hands on the cup that promises immortality.

A good supporting cast is on hand to give the story all the excitement it generates, including Denholm Elliot as a clueless professor and Alison Doody as an adventuress who seems to be helping the Nazis but turns against them at a crucial moment until her own greed works against her fate.

All of it is filmed at a breathtaking pace, never stopping long enough to make you dwell on flaws in the logic of Indy's cliffhanging escapes and fights with Nazis aboard tanks in the desert. But aside from action, the script provides plenty of insight into the relationship between father and son, peppered with some witty dialog.

All ages should enjoy this one, about as good as the original Indy film with the addition of Sean Connery providing welcome bits of warmth and humor.",1338163200,,1551,4.670329670329671
3363665,5,B0014C2FX8,"Perhaps the best film of the series is The Last Crusade. It starts slowly then picks up with the appearance of Walter Donovan, a truly fine villain, who's played by Julian Glover. Still the opening scene is used to reveal the estranged relationship between father and son. It also sets the groundwork for the reconciliation that follows in the story. This personal reconciliation will continue with the people in his life in the next film, The Crystal Skull. You'll find more character depiction and development in these last two films than the first two films. Now that's okay with the first film when the characters and the series was being introduced to the public but sequels can be a problem if the character basically stays the same.

River Phoenix performed vey well as a young Jones and the story of Coronado's cross was quite amusing but it sort of stalls with the episode about the recovery of the cross some time later. Still it depicts a man who is still stubbornly insisting on having it his own way: that belongs in a museum! The major storyline begins with his return to college with Coronado's Cross but its the appearance of Walter Donovan that gets the story started and Jones on his way to Europe in search of his father along with their friend, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott). Allison Doody plays the femme fatale, Dr. Elsa Schneider. Like Jones she apparently wants everything her way and will do anything to get it. She and Vogel, the SS officer, each aids Donovan in their own way.

Sean Connery nearly steals the show. His performance as Jones' father was superb. He effectively co-starred with Harrison Ford in this film. John Rhys-Davies as Sallah and Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody are fine support actors. Ford and Connery receive a good deal of support from their friends and their foes in the cast of this story. A real fine scene takes place when Junior asks his Dad how did you know that she was a Nazi?! She talks in her sleep, he replies. It's a well written film filled with plenty of good scenes and reams of talent behind its production. Overall it's really an enjoyable film from start to finish.",1336867200,,2135,4.675531914893617

I just love the story and humor and the relationship between the father and son, which is filled with so much angst like so many father-son relationships I know. It's a sweet way to end the trilogy of films. Plus, it made me fall in love with Sean Connery forever after. Many other people I know love Raiders of the Lost Ark best, and consider it the ultimate classic of the series, but this was the film I and my friends saw first, so this is the one that affected us the most. All in all, it's an exhilarating joy-ride from beginning to end, with a touching finale.",1330646400,,644,4.330578512396694
3363667,5,B0014C2FX8,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade has striking similarities to Raiders of the Lost Ark, in that it has the familiar chase scenes, snakes, villians, and the quest for a religious artifact. This time, son and father meet up and together they search for the holy grail. Ford and Connery mesh well, and the movie is given a boost by their chemistry and humor. This movie has an adundance of action (as it should) and that coupled with humor and a great story allows for a great movie experience. River Phoenix just nails it as young Indy; his mannerisms were spot-on. In the end, father knows best, and Indy is in awe of his father's wit. For the record, this movie has great stunts, special effects, sound, and picture quality. I hope Lucas and Spielberg make one more movie, giving the franchise 5 movies in all.",1324598400,,811,4.561643835616438
3363668,5,B0014C2FX8,"The Last Crusade is, without a doubt, my favorite of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Harrison Ford's acting as Indy is superb, yet this film takes the added bonus that is Sean Connery as Indy's father. ""The Last Crusade"" is a story of intrigue and betrayal, as are the other Indiana Jones movies, yet the race against the Nazis in this film seems a race for humanity, as both Indy and the Nazis attempt to find the most treasured of all treasures: the Holy Grail. Indiana Jones is at his best in this race. The film has stunning action scenes as well as religious intrigue from the time of the Templars and the birth of Christianity.

The scenery, spanning Europe with the last section filmed at Petra, Jordan, is also stunning. The DVD edition exists not to have fancy special features, simply so that you can enjoy this classic as it was meant to be enjoyed as a tale for both old and young!",1310428800,,888,4.447852760736196
3363669,5,B0014C2FX8,"If Raiders was action-packed and Temple of Doom was scary, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is hilarious. It takes the original Indiana Jones formula and treats it irreverently. That's the genius of this film. Sean Connery as Indy's dad was brilliant casting. Having the former James Bond try to overshadow and outdo the son makes for both funny and emotionally touching moments.

The other characters stand out as well. The new Indy girl, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody) is both gorgeous and very complex. One is never sure of her loyalties, making her one of my favorite Indy girls of the entire series. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) was briefly seen in the first movie but now has a more prominent part as almost a source of comedic relief. Some of the best moments are his attempts to cope with Indy's adventure. Only Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), the expedition's funder, comes off as boring or less than meets the eye.

Aside from the humor, it's the moving father-son relationship that between Henry and Indiana Jones that really makes this fun to watch. Unlike Crystal Skull, which overdid the ""lost son"" angle, Last Crusade pulled just the right amount on the emotional chords. The two have a competitive relationship, but it never becomes melodramatic. The end is particularly poignant.

Aside from Raiders, this is easily the best of the Indiana Jones series, and definitely the funniest.",1309392000,,1406,4.974468085106383
3363670,4,B0014C2FX8,"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(1989) is not as iconic as Raiders, but it's breezier than Temple of Doom. In 1938, Indiana Jones(Harrison Ford) travels to Europe to rescue his father. Together, they must stop The Nazis from getting to the Holy Grail. The Last Crusade plays it safe and sticks to the formula from the first film. John Williams wrote another superb music score; the music cue that he composed for Indiana's father is quite tender. Spielberg and Lucas succeeded in casting Sean Connery as Indy's father! Alison Doody(A View to a Kill) is quite good as a two-faced Austrian woman! The first 15 minutes of the film had the late River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones! This may have been the genesis of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles(1992, TV). Showing parents at odds with their children is shown in many Steven Spielberg movies. The Last Crusade does try to emulate Raiders by giving screen time to John Ryhs-Davies and Denholm Elliot. Many ideas from the Indiana Jones movies ended up in Universal's reboot of The Mummy franchise. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is my personal favorite of the Indy movies.",1307664000,,1135,4.855670103092783
3363671,3,B0014C2FX8,"This is a third-rate sort of film. It mostly served as a very expensive advertisement for the young indiana jones chronicals television series and a big payday for Sean Connery.

The film looks cheap. Compared to the first two films, it has the appearance of being done on a low budget. The sets are small and not very elaborate. The action sequeneces are minimal. And large stretches of the film are just boring. Connery is Indiana Jones father who is searching for the Holy Grail. Ford has to search for both the Grail and for his father. A lengthy ""young indiana jones"" seqeuence inserted into the film ends up cutting down the time devoted to the main plot. There is also a long pointless diversion into Hitler's germany.

Connery does little in the film. He is mostly there to be the stereotypical ""bad father"" who has enough prestige to be the father of Indiana Jones. Its not the worst Indiana Jones film and its not that its terrible. Its just not anywhere near the standard of the first two films.",1293494400,2,1006,4.583333333333333

3363674,5,B0014C2FX8,"If I had to choose a favorite Indy film, this is the one I would select immediately. The Last Crusade is without a doubt the best Indy film of all, even surpassing Raiders. It has the same formula as Raiders (the Nazis are here, Marcus & Sallah return, a Biblical artifact is being searched, etc.), but it has more action, more humor, and also a welcome addition to the entire franchise, which is Sean Connery as Henry Jones. Connery is perfect as Indy's father, and the chemistry between the two main leads is really enjoyable to watch. A few of the special effects shots may look a bit dated, but who cares? Last Crusade is the ultimate Indy film. Temple of Doom may be too dark, Crystal Skull may be too silly, Raiders is perfectly fine, but Last Crusade is the one that has the most. And it does its job really well: it entertains us in the most excellent way possible. A great action-adventure, indeed.

3363676,5,B0014C2FX8,"After the critical failure of ""Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom"" director Steven Speilberg wisely chose a script that wasn't as dark and morbid as the second installment in the ""Indiana"" franchise. In this outing Indiana Jones (played by hunk Harrison Ford) searches for his father (starring James Bond himself, Sean Connery) who has been captured by the evil Nazis in the late 1930's. The story takes place in many locales including Italy and England. This movie is action packed, fast paced, excitingly directed, and at times even comedic. The chemistry between Ford and Connery is also evident as the viewer would actually think they are father and son. The movie was released in May, 1989 and went on to gross nearly $500,000,000 at the boxoffice becomg a certified hit. The film won the Oscar for Best Sound as well.

3363677,4,B0014C2FX8,"Its hard for me to review this movie as an adult.  I was a large fan of the Indiana Jones movie as a child growing up, and this was the only one of the original trilogy that I had the opportunity to see on the big screen, and I loved it.  It was very action packed and funny and never really let up.  It did capture the imagination of my child mind, but now watching it as an adult I have to say that the reason that it captures your imagination is that none of it is possible. The movie starts with a great introduction of Indiana as a teenager discovering ""evil grave robbers"" discover a historic cross, wait a second isn't that kinda what indy does his whole life, digging up historical artifacts, because as it is explained ""it belongs in a meuseum"".  It is with such broad stroke morality that the rest of the movie can be told.  In the special features it is discussed that this is really the one that Spielberg and Lucas made as a crowd pleaser.  The chase ends with a train pursuit where we learn in broad strokes where Indy's fear of snakes comes from and where he originally got his scar.  At the end of it, Indy is trapped at a locked kaboose with no way to escape, but wait, there are a lot of items used in a magic act laying about in the car, so Indy goes into a magic box and when the bad guys come in to find him, they open the box that desinigrates but with no trace of Indy.  Indy is then scene running outside the car, which by the way opens for the bad guys to better see Indy making his escape.  I remember from that era that magic was really popular, and really worked best on film as you could cut it together to make it look however you want, even though we know this is impossible for magic prop to transport indy outside of the car, its an effective film gag that leaves my adult self scratching my head.  Indy returns to his house where the police are waiting and take the cross back to the legal and rightful owners, cut to adult Indy, still searching after the cross, where he kills every one of the legal owners to take it back to a meusium.  Also notice that the lovable villain that gave Indy his trademark hat isn't on the boat that gets blown up.  So we learn about the grail then go to Venice to the most problematic scene of the movie.  The sewer made of gas.  Indy and his love interest are walking through said moat of petrol with torches that you can see pits of the tourch dropping off and falling still ablaze into the liquid.  The defenders of the grail discover Indy is looking for the grail and light the sewer.  Indy hides under the coffin that keeps them from burning up, looks underwater, i guess the liquid turned to water, cause gasoline would burn your eyes if you were swimming in it, and finds an exit to swim into the vinice sewer system.  Thats right, the petrol sewer under the library connects with the water based venice sewer, nulifying the need to go through the library to begin with, not to mention that the petrol would dilute with the water, and notice how as the defenders of the grail, when leaving the library, are in a dead sprint, as if they know Indy escaped, but its so faced paced, you really aren't supposed to ask questions.  I don't understand why Indy is let go after the boat chase.  We go to get his father from Austria, and I still don't understand why Indy goes through the window to avoid triggering the door alarm when after he reunites with his father, they leave through said door.  I don't see why the plain would go through the tunnel, makes no sense.  Also when on the blimp and the funny no ticket line that all the germans react to, when its not in german, and it would definately give Indy away as being an American.  There is the sign that says Venice this way, Berlin the other, like those are the only two points that are of any consequence in Austria.  The entire movie is driven to get to the stunt scenes, embrace the popular christian faith as to reinforce basic morality without becoming preachy as their is no substance to this movie, and show a humorous coming together between Indy and his father.  Nazi's are stupid and as Stevie says, its a get out of jail free card to abuse a Nazi.  Its broad strokes history that in retrospect Nazi's were bad, they burned books, Indy saved the day.  This is the worst of the original trilogy by far, and even though its not exactly a reality based series by any means, a lot of the solutions that are made in this movie are so impractical that it head scratching.  I do love the Sean Connery, especially his well now what do you want to talk about speach, or that they both diddled the same girl.  There is definately style in this movie, but I think the creator became too comfortable in that style and quit trying, not as bad as crystal skull which is unwatchable, but still very shallow film.  Great effects and do have to watch it without thinking too hard.  Great visuals.  Definately worth watching though, at least once.",1264809600,,4966,4.296137339055794

3363681,5,B0014C2FX8,"Spielberg was well inspired again and anew after the badly thought second episode and he brought his Indiana Jones back to the Nazi time and context. It's clear and some of the scenes, including the meeting with Adolf Hitler himself are sickeningly obnoxious and hilariously crystal clear: Hitler is evil, he burns books, he kills people, he enjoys it and he is surrounded by the scum of humanity. But Spielberg goes one iota further and introduces his version of the American Nazi and this one is worse than Adolf Hitler himself, he has no historical ambition or vision just plain personal and self centered egotistic interest. He is a Nazi out of pure opportunism and that is even worse evil than Nazism itself. But Spielberg gets to another dimension too by introducing Indiana Jones's father and Sean Connery does quite a credible father of that crazy adventurer, or should I say adventuring archaeology professor. But one improvement is never enough for our Spielberg and this time the main woman is an evil traitor, a Nazi that prefers dying to letting the prey of her hunt go, even when it is obviously too late and out of reach. And that prey is the Holy Grail, mind you. This time the myth is a good western myth, Christian what's more. And this myth needs a delicate treatment but has immense possibilities for us and these possibilities are used right to the end. So we discover the underground catacombs of Venice and their rats, a good old chase on a train transporting a circus and all its animals, a sacred temple in Jordan and all kinds of religious symbols and traps, and the winners are those who believe in and respect these symbols, and that has to be Indiana Jones and his father. Too bad for all the others: the treasure hunter who takes the most beautiful and golden chalice and dies on the spot after drinking from it, the greedy woman who disappears in the depth of the earth, and all the other bad guys and bad boys. Some scene are superb like the crazy German tank in the desert. Every detail is hilarious and suspenseful and even a second viewing, or probably even more, is as effective as the first one. Very well inspired indeed this time, this famous Spielberg, but since he made Dr Jones Senior drink the water of eternal life in the Holy Grail itself, he is doomed to go on and on with that legend. The fourth episode has already been produced and Harrison Ford has just announced a few days ago he was ready to get into the adventure of a fifth episode, now he has been provided with a son in this fourth episode: he has to guide the new Junior into the next stage of the quest.

With two highly successful films already established in the series, the third one would no doubt enthrall fans to some degree, but would the quality of the first two films remain intact all the way through the third; or has Indiana Jones finally met his match?

Upon receiving disturbing news that his father, Professor Henry Jones, Sr. (Sean Connery) has gone missing while on his lifelong quest to discover the Holy Grail; Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) embarks upon a search to save his estranged father from the clutches of some familiar enemies... the Nazis. Assisted by his loyal friends Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott), Indy will do everything within his power to save his father, stop the Nazis once again, and maybe even discover the resting place of the mystical Holy Grail in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".

After the success of ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", I'm somewhat surprised, when looking back, by the five year gap between the second and third movies. Especially when in numerous interviews, director Steven Spielberg has stated that he felt that ""Temple of Doom"" was kind of a letdown to audiences and was far too dark of a picture, and that he wanted to make another adventure to sort of redeem the character and himself. I guess one could make the argument that by not rushing into a third film, Spielberg and co-creator/producer George Lucas could avoid making another movie that would be viewed as a disappointment in at least their eyes, and perhaps even in the eyes of fans and critics. I just thought Spielberg would have pushed for a little faster turnaround in regards to the supposed redemption of the series; instead of waiting five years to do so, but that's me and I'm not in charge.

Apparently throughout the five year lull between sequels, both Spielberg and Lucas, along with writer Jeffrey Boam (""Lethal Weapon 2""), took advantage of the time and were able to create what I believe to be the absolute best Indiana Jones adventure yet. The concept of linking the quest for the Holy Grail to Indy's quest to prove himself to his father was a very strong backbone with which to base this newest adventure. This approach allowed for some really interesting, and at times incredibly fun, moments within the film for the actors, and the team behind the camera, to mine for cinematic gold.

One of the major strong points this film has working in its favor is the smartly written banter between Indy and his father, with both of them constantly trying to get the last word in on any topic. Plus, it's intriguing to see that everything Indiana has done, his father has most likely done, and in his own opinion, has done it better; so for Indy, we get a sense that he feels as if he's constantly living in his father's shadow, which becomes a major source of contention for the father/son duo. I also enjoyed the return of the Nazis as a villain for the series, the Thuggee cult in the second film was good, but the Nazis were a much more lethal threat, and given the time in which the films are set, they seemed an appropriate choice for Indy to tackle. Lastly, the tease at the beginning of the film that introduced us to a young, inexperienced Indiana Jones was very refreshing, and provided some neat bits of exposition regarding Indy's fear of snakes, his code of honor in regards to tomb raiding, and even went so far as to explain the scar on his chin. All of these little moments early on in the film, coupled with several more that were sprinkled throughout, just added to the overall enjoyment I had with this movie experience.

Harrison Ford really surprised me by his ability to bring even more depth to a character that he's already played twice. With this being the third time Harrison played this role, I would have thought that he had done all he could with this character, and if his father hadn't been introduced into the series, then perhaps there would have been no new ground to cover. Thanks to that addition, Harrison was given some new areas of Indy's life and personality to explore, allowing for the character to not only remain fresh for him, but also for the audience that has followed him throughout all his adventures. Just to clarify, even if Harrison was unable to really cover any new ground with the character; that would have been fine too, so long as this movie was to be intended as the final chapter in the character's franchise. Because once a character quits growing/evolving, the audience will quickly lose interest, due to it being more of the same old thing, and the actor playing the part will most likely feel the exact same way; therefore resulting in a sub-par performance and inferior sequel.

Joining Harrison Ford on his quest we find a few familiar faces, such as John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, Indiana's trusted ally in Cairo. I was pleased to see Sallah's return to the series, after feeling like there was much more that could have been done with the character in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Also returning was actor Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody, Indy's close friend and associate; actually he seems more like a manager when it comes to his various archaeological adventures, but let's not split hairs. Joining the cast is screen legend Sean Connery, who brings Indy's father to life in all his cantankerous, scene chewing glory. As terrific as the dynamic between father and son proved to be in this film, Sean never ceased to steal every scene he was in, even when Harrison was at the top of his game matching Sean quip for quip. As great as Sean was in the role, one thing did bug me about his casting. Although he did attempt to hide it, his accent was still apparent in several scenes. Yet for some reason, no one ever made note of it. I guess we were just supposed to ignore it, but I for one would have liked some form of explanation for why he has an accent that his son clearly has no hint of. This doesn't seem like too far-fetched of a request, especially when the writer was going so far as to explain why Indy has a scar on his chin and even where he got the nickname Indiana from in the first place. Maybe I'm the only one that's had this thought; and if so, I guess that's fine, but it just struck me as odd was all.

If director Steven Spielberg was hoping to redeem himself with ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"", for what he felt was a failure with his previous effort in the series; then, I would have to say he has succeeded brilliantly. I agree that the darker tone of ""Temple of Doom"" did feel different from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but I also felt that it was a natural progression for the character and the series (generally the middle chapter is the darkest); that being said, I was happy that this movie was more in line with the tone of the original film. Even though the tone for this movie was similar to that of the first, there is one major difference between this film and its predecessors; this one seemed like it was done much better, and felt more polished than either of the previous two ever came close to being.

Overall, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is a great sequel, and for me, it is the best the series has ever been. Loaded with great storytelling, terrific acting, some truly touching moments, and even some hilarious ones, this is one movie that is definitely worth watching.

""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",1225497600,,7944,4.636363636363637
3363691,5,B0014C2FX8,"As the title so prominently mentions, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE was originally intended to be the last of the Indiana Jones film series.  The movie is an origins story and fills in many of the questions that fans had about the character, e.g. where did Indy get his scar, where did he get his whip, why is he afraid of snakes, etc.

The extended opening of the film begins in Utah where Indy (played by River Phoenix here) and his Boy Scout troop are out for a day of riding and exploring.  Indy and a fellow Scout separate from the group and stumble upon a group of men who have just discovered the Cross of Coronado.  Indy believes the object belongs in a museum, while the men just want the fortune the find will bring.  Indy steals the cross and the diggers chase after him.  It's a race through the rough terrain that climaxes aboard a circus train.

After explaining some of Indy's origins, the film fast forwards to 1938.  Indy (now once again played by Harrison Ford) is hired by a wealthy ""collector of antiquities"" to find the missing pieces of a map that reveal the resting place of the Holy Grail.  He learns that is father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery) has already gone missing in the quest.  In order to find his father, Indy takes the quest.  The journey takes Indy from Italy, Austria, and the Middle East.  The Nazis are once again the villains and are intent on adding another spiritual artifact to their growing collection as preparation for their attempt of world domination.

Out of all the Indiana Jones films, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is my favorite. The film has some wonderful acting, particularly by River Phoenix in the opening segment and by Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in the rest of the picture.  Ford and Connery have a great rapport between each other and their relationship grounds the picture in reality.  The movie is chock-full of action.  I also like how the film brought back the characters of Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott).  There is some criticism of the character of Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), but the beautiful and conflicted Schneider makes a perfect female foil for Indy in the movie.

INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is sometimes criticized for being less realistic in its action sequences than the two previous films and having too much physical comedy.  The movie is lighter in tone than the previous two films in the franchise, but that doesn't make it any less realistic nor does it overshadow the serious journey that Indy, his father, and their companions are on.  Continuing a theme that was hinted at in INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE is a film that despite the action and humor is really about renewal and redemption.  It's a movie that when the final credits roll at the end a person can sit back and really feel like they have found ""illumination.""",1222560000,,2908,4.651663405088063

Sean Connery co-stars as Indy's dad who always calls him 'Junior' Indy's dad is being held hostage by Nazi's, so Indy must save his dad, and find the Holy Grail before the Nazi's do! Indy's dad makes the movie a lot funnier, like when Elsa is talking to Indy about 'how great IT was', and Indy's dad thinks she is talking to him! I also love God's booby traps while Indy was trying to find the Grail to save his dad because the Nazi's shot him!

3363694,5,B0014C2FX8,"In 1938, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has discovered a diary and a map that can lead to the holy grail of Christ.

After they have rescued Henry, they must try to find the Holy Grail before the Nazis do cause the Nazis want to take over the world with super nazis if they were granted the powers.

Brilliant sequel that manages to improve over the dark and gruesome ""Temple of Doom"" and just as good as the first installment. This is a very entertaining sequel with all the goods like great acting especially from the late River Phoenix and John Rhys-Davis as Sallah, fantastic special effects like the amazing death of Donovan, action, a little romance and of course humor. This is a great movie from both Steven Spielburg and George Lucas as they made a truly solid installment that is very satisfying.

This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with good extras like an introduction by Spielburg and Lucas, three featurettes, photo galleries and a DVD-rom PC Lego Indiana Jones demo.",1213747200,2,1251,4.813953488372093
3363695,5,B0014C2FX8,"The Last Crusade recaptured the fun and excitement of the first Indiana Jones movie with a father son pair-up that is both genius and funny.  James Bond and Indiana Jones together...now there's a dynamic duo!  What is especially ironic is that Spielberg was inspired to have a cloak and dagger plot in the Indiana Jones series that was born from a love the James Bond films.

Harrison Ford brings Indiana Jones back to life with an amazing performance. But this time we get to see a bit of the little boy who is trying to impress his father.  A couple of the most enjoyable parts of the movie are when Indiana does something that he is proud of and looks to his father for approval...only to gets a look of disdain!

Sean Connery has always been one of my favorite actors ever since the early days of Bond. A true mans man and a ladies man. He seems to be as comfortable in a suit as wresting in the mud.  Connery gives a stunning performance in the Last Crusade as a driven man in search of the Holy Grail who deeply loves his son, but as with many fathers, is clumsy at expressing that love.  One of the great lines of the movie came when Connery confronts his son about the origin of his adventurous name when he says in typical Connery fashion: ""The dogs name was Indiana!""

There are many memorable scenes.  We get to find out why Indy hates snakes. In the opening of the movie the young Indy (played by River Phoenix) falls into a circus train car full of snakes...and hates them ever after.  Who can blame him!  Another memorable scene is when Indiana comes face to face with Hitler (at a rally in Berlin) who signs the critical journal Indy is holding.

The plot is about a quest for the Holy Grail that has incalculable value and magical powers to bring long...long life.  The plot twists and turns, frightens and delights as our heroes get closer to the final prize.  In one of the final twists of the plot Indian must ""Choose Wisely"" to save his father's life and not losing his own!

Overall a great addition to the Indiana Jones collection!

3363696,2,B0014C2FX8,"For some reason, unbeknownst to me, quite a few people (and reviewers) dismissed the excellent ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" (also reviewed) as the worst sequel in the original 80's Indy series and some said it was just simply a bad film...full stop. They derided the film so much that I wondered if they had actually seen it at all, so unjust was the ""outrage"" against the episode. Obviously, the fact that ""Temple of Doom"" was following the truly wonderful ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (the only really great film of the 4) had a negative effect on how some were going to view the first sequel in the series, as no matter how hard Lucas and Spielberg et al tried they couldn't hope to top the incredible impact that ""Raiders"" had on the public.

But unfortunately, it seems that the producers of the Indy series abandoned their own judgment and bent over backwards in an attempt to eliminate the darker elements of ""Temple of Doom"" and replace it with lashings of incredibly stupid and inane comedy for the third installment, ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"".

So vehement were the producers of ""Last Crusade"" to replace serious content with appalling idiocy, they were willing to litter the movie with slapstick nonsense that destroyed the overall film.

Of course, that doesn't mean that the film is a complete write off in every department. The basic story is OK (but only just) and sees our hero following in his fathers obsessive quest for the famed cup of Christ, or the Holy Grail. The essential plot elements are all there and includes the usual Indy staples of multiple locations, deadly traps and spectacular supernatural McGuffin. Even the Germans were forced back into their nazi uniforms to don their traditional Hollywood caricature as the badguys; Which, in my opinion was a bit tired and un-necessary. There are plenty of bad folk around and their presentation here is far, far inferior than their turn in ""Raiders"".

Most in the movies favor, and the only reason this film gets an extra star, is the inclusion of Sean Connery as Indy's dad. It's a good plot device to hang the kinda weak central plot onto and Connery's performance as the bungling Old Man of Henry Jones Jr is quite delightful and he has some great lines too...""We named the dog Indiana"".

The shared screen time of Ford and Connery generally works well and they pair of them seemed to be having a good time in their roles.

Another mention should go to Irish actress Alison Doody, as the obligatory squeeze (with a twist) and Denholm Elliott who reprises his charming role as Marcus Brody, dean of Indy's college in America. Unfortunately, it was to be for the last time.

Also of note, is a floppy haired River Phoenix as a young Indiana in the movies brilliant opening sequence.

Unfortunately, after the opening is complete, the film starts to go rapidly downhill until it naturally reaches it's ridiculously absurd climax, by which time my suspension of disbelief had had enough and Mr Cynicism had stepped in.

But even the rapidly disintegrating story would have been bearable if Spielberg and Lucas had refrained from carelessly dropping the incredibly unfunny attempts at ""humour"" through the film. Sure, the two preceding efforts had liberal amounts of humour sprinkled within it's opening and ending credits, but it remained subtle and never interfered with the overall product or the ""seriousness"" of the piece. In ""Raiders"" Indy shoots the sword wielding foe with his revolver, instead of fighting him with a sword and in ""Temple of Doom"" he tries it again, but this time his gun has been missing since the opening sequence. These humourous efforts are fine and funny and what's more they are limited to reality. They don't break down the walls of reality and destroy the suspense or action of a given scene.

Whereas the ""humour"" in the ""Last Crusade"" is so heavy handed that it completely ruins a scene. For instance, when Indy breaks his way through a library floor in Venice to get to a secret chamber, the noise he naturally makes breaking the floor is mistaken by a librarian for the noise he makes while he is stamping overdue books. Now, this may be fine in a Monty Python movie, but in a film such as an Indy adventure, it is just stupid. There's no other words for it. It ruins the suspense of the scene.

Likewise the ""No Ticket"" scene in the Zeppelin and the ridiculous Berlin book burning scene where Indy meets Hitler, coupled with the scene where the BF108 pilot sheers his wings off and continues traveling down a tunnel beside a car containing the Jones boys go a long way towards tearing apart any suspension of disbelief that's required equipment for watching a film of this sort. It's unbelievably groan making, destroys the suspense and danger and it's difficult to imagine anyone finding it enjoyable.

At it's conclusion ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" has long since revealed itself another 'could have been' film. It could have been great, but it's let down terribly by the decision to dilute the overall effect with mind numbing idiocy and it kills any excitement with dreadful foot stamping comedy that even a Will Ferrell movie would scoff at.",1211846400,6,5185,4.787472035794184

3363698,3,B0014C2FX8,"I couldn't decide whether to give this movie a two star or a three star rating.  It is infinitely better than 1984's dreary TEMPLE OF DOOM but still way, way behind 1981's awesome RAIDERS.

What I've never liked about the Indiana Jones sequels is the consistency of the main character.  In RAIDERS, his character was perfect: a humble but passionate scholar in the classroom and a two-fisted, determined adventurer everywhere else.  No hint of ego, only drive and even obsession about the next great find.

In TEMPLE OF DOOM, he's first seen in a Shanghai nightclub in a tux like he's James Bond.  The rest of that movie is too much of a train wreck to even pay attention to him after that.

In THE LAST CRUSADE, he starts off well enough...but then there are silly scenes that take away from the movie's overall tension.  The ""Ah, Venice"" lines took away from why Indy was in Venice in the first place: he smiles and says ""Ah, Venice"" upon arrival--as if completely forgetting that his father's been kidnapped--and then reads some silly lines before ending up on the floor with the Fraulien before ending the sequence with, ""Ah, Venice.""  Nice device...in another movie.  In LAST CRUSADE, it felt like Indy forgot just what he was in Venice for in the first place.

Then having Indy show up at the castle doing a really bad Scottish accent was just schtick and, again, drained a lot of tension.  Look at how the humor in RAIDERS never took away from the overall momentum and tightening of the tension in the story and you'll see what I mean.

The action sequences were also a far cry from the first film.  The Nazi fighter plane zipped around like an X-wing from a STAR WARS movie.  The big tank sequence didn't have any of the unpredictability and energy of the main chase in RAIDERS (didn't it look obviously staged that Indy is dragging along a completely straight wall alongside the tank, coming close to a suspiciously squared block at the end of it?).  Both of the sequels appeared to have too many special effects and not enough spontaneity in their action set pieces.

I was also disappointed that they chose to play Marcus Brody as a bumbling oaf and Sallah became more of an Arab caricature than ever.

But I won't be completely negative.  Some of it worked.  Sean Connery was great as Dr. Henry Jones Sr. and his scenes with Harrison Ford made the movie.  The Holy Grail was a much weaker storyline than the Ark of the Covenant but it was still so much better than the glowing rocks from TEMPLE OF DOOM.

Yes, these movies are about having fun--but they're much funner when the characters DON'T look like they're having fun too.

I still gotta go with RAIDERS as the only great Indiana Jones movie.  I hope this new one coming out next week is good!",1210636800,3,2761,4.565040650406504

8255031,5,B0014C2FX8,"So this fantastic final chapter of the Indiana Jones trilogy centers around Indy and his companions including his father Henry Jones played by Sean Connery as they search to find the Holy Grail. What's not to like about this movie? It's got James Bond, Indy kicking Nazi ass again, and a huge quest to find the Cup of Christ, it's awesome! If you ask anybody which Indiana Jones movie is the best they will either say Raiders or Crusade but most will say Crusade, and I can't disagree. Our story starts with young Indiana Jones when he recovers an ancient cross from some bandits in the desert. Our story then flashes forward only one year after Raiders Of The Lost Ark when he hears news that his father is missing, so he travels to Venice to try and figure out where his father is. He soon meets up with his father's assistant Elsa who takes him to the library where he was last scene, and through a series of clues they discover not the whereabouts of his father but a crypt containing one of the Knights of the First Crusade. Engraved on the Knight's shield is a clue to find the Grail. Very soon after they meet a secret order that protects the Grail and discover his father has been taken by the Nazis and taken to Munich. So they get to Munich they rescue his father and now the chase is on to discover one of the greatest artifacts in human history. It's got lots of action, very good comedy, intriguing history of the Grail and is just good fun and has a fantastic ending. Go buy these movies. Watch them. Love them.

This review is for the 2003 Paramount DVD release, Single-disc, Full Screen.

In 1912, in Utah, a 13-year old Indiana Jones (River Phoenix) in the Boy Scouts enters a cave and finds Fedora (Richard Young) and his grave robbers have found a gold cross. It is the Cross of Coronado. Indy believes it belongs in a museum. In a wild chase, Indy manages to get the cross from Fedora and he makes it home to his father's house. However, the Sheriff (Marc Miles) comes in and makes Indy give it back to Fedora who then gives it to Panama Hat (Tim Hiser).
  Now it is 1938 and Professor Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is on a ship near the Portuguese coast. Once again, he has the Cross of Coronado and Panama Hat (Paul Maxwell) tries to claim it, but this time Indy has it for good and makes it back to the University.
  Indy receives an offer from Walter Donovan (Julian Glover)  to find Jesus' Chalice, the cup Jesus the Christ used during The Last Supper. It is known as The Holy Grail. A man has vanished whom was in search of the cup. They want Indiana Jones to pick up the trail where he left off. The man that has disappeared is Indy's father, Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery).

Also in the cast: Alex Hyde-White, Alison Doody, Michael Byrne, Billy J. Mitchell, Robert Eddison.

Harrison Ford became the age of 46 during filming.

  I enjoy this Indiana Jones movie so much and what it stands for. Like the moral value of it too. Sean Connery's performance is perfect. Harrison Ford knows his character well.  Too bad they didn't make more Indiana Jones movies while Harrison Ford was in his prime.
