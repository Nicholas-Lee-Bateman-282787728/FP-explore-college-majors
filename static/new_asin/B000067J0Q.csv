It was so popular after the release that it went on to become a franchised series including `Mighty Baby' and `Driving Miss Wealthy.' Well, I said `romantic comedy,' but `La Brassiere` does not exactly provide the Hollywood-type humor. It is more direct and crude, and if you remember `What Women Want' and its most unsophisticated sequence -- Mel Gibson using hair-removing cream, you can imagine what you will see in most of the `comical' scenes of the film.

The film does not attempt to hide its obvious inspiration. A lingerie company (of which employees are all women) breaks its tradition, and hires two males Johnny (Ching Wan Lau) and Wayne (Louis Koo). They have to design a perfect bra within three months, but J & W (as their names indicate) are too `macho' and male-centered to understand the needs of the marketplace, or `What Women Wants.'

These males with misguided ideas about women - though one of them is a handsome womanizer and the other has a girlfriend - completely fail to understand the women's heart until they fall for female office workers of the same company, Samantha (Carina Lau) and Lena (Gigi Leung). These guys come to understand women not by supernatural power, but by just falling in love. No listening to women's inner voices here.

While the romantic story of `La Brassiere' is driven forward to the inevitable ending by formulaic episodes, it also gives some comic moments during the course. Some of the viewers might find the film's gags too gross and childish because they include such scenes as Johnny prowling naked in the office (don't ask why), or Johnny and Wayne trying to wear the bra in the proper way (with artificial breast in it) in front of advising Lena and all the co-workers. You find these scenes either hilarious or downright embarrassing, and probably it depends on your mood of the day.

`La Brassiere' has some cameo appearances from Karen Mok and Patrick Tam, but the film's strongest point is the good acting from Ching Wan Lau, who makes the character of Johnny an amiable one. Unfortunately not amiable enough for us to forget the negative sides of these two males, and I don't believe a girl as sweet as Lena would fall in love with a womanizing man like Wayne. And very cute Gigi Leung should be one of the merits of the film, but the film sadly fails to use her charms to the full.

After all `La Brassiere' is a typical case of comedy of which quality is decided by its directness of the gags. You see lots of women in underwear but no social commentary on gender or business, not even a cursory one. Actors just do or say silly things, and we laugh. It is simple as that. I liked it for that, but you may hate it for exactly the same reason.",1153526400,2,2767,4.615853658536586
8173570,2,B000067J0Q,"Gigi Leung is the big female star here and she's known mostly as a singer in Hong Kong and the Pacific Rim area.  She's gorgeous but has a reputation of being a wooden actress.  She's getting better but La Brassiere is not her best role.  The humor is typical for most modern Hong Kong films, bawdy, tasteless, broad and -- as one reviewer has already stated -- very similar to Benny Hill.  It's just not done as well as Benny Hill did it.  You can watch it to watch Gigi, there's much worse things to do than that.  Karen Mok appears for a few minutes in a completely nonsensical role.  That was a waste of her time.  Hope she got paid well for it.  Lau Ching Wan is always funny...except this time.  Louis Koo is on hand for the ladies but you'll have more fun watching him in Why Me Sweetie.  This is for Hong Kong film aficianados and Louis and Gigi fans only.",1131148800,2,864,4.2073170731707314
8173571,4,B000067J0Q,It's about a bra company that decides to hire a couple of men to gain a new perspective over an all-female work force.  The men are fish out of water and it's just a cute comedy.  It's worth watching.  ...,1022889600,3,205,4.075
