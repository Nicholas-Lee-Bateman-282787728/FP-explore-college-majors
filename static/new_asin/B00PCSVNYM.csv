8687464,2,B00PCSVNYM,"I've seen just about every CSN/CSNY documentary out there and this one is the worst one I've seen.  Mostly footage of Bob Costas's interview with David.  Very short bits with Stephen, Graham and Neil at the beginning and that was it.  The ""rare"" performances and footage can mostly be easily found on YouTube.  Editing was pretty terrible.  Two stars only because I love CSN/Y and no matter how bad it is I'll watch it :).",1472083200,,422,4.573333333333333
8687465,2,B00PCSVNYM,"Very poor quality DVD and not worth the money, this does not tell you much about the group and has very low sound and picture quality for a DVD.",1452643200,2,144,4.0
8687466,2,B00PCSVNYM,short and not very good.the only thing I liked was the Stephen Stills bits in it. think twice before buying it JAN,1446076800,2,114,4.2272727272727275
8687467,1,B00PCSVNYM,"This is a bootlegged video of CSN concert. its so grainy i can't stand to watch it.  sound is so-so. i tried to send it back and the seller wouldn't respond.  very poor purchase, but at $8 you can lose a few.  jr",1443312000,2,212,3.883720930232558
8687468,1,B00PCSVNYM,"I agree with the first 2 reviews written. ..garbage. l waited for Amazon. ..to release this. ..... l wish l saw these reviews prior to purchase. . Reminds me of an old Byrds song...Everybody's been burned. .stuff of this quality should not see the light of day. .
.yes the best part of the whole schmozzle is the picture cover",1425859200,2,326,4.45
8687469,1,B00PCSVNYM,"I am a completest so I kinda knew this would be at best a fair DVD documentary.  When you load it, the menu states, and I quote (and I am not kidding) ""Woodstock 1971"".......it was 1969 people!  In fact one of the reasons I plunked down for this sub-VHS quality video and at best variable sonic quality DVD is that they do ""Woodstock"".....well....it is only an alternate mix (that I am guessing is commercially available) that sounds great by the way, of a STUDIO version of the song, with stock 1969 PEOPLE crowd footage overlying a nice sounding rendition (studio) of the song.
2 of the songs are from the grey market available London stop of the 1974 tour and this includes ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" polluted by Joni Mitchell's vocals and a HORRIBLE video and sound of ""Our House.""  They claim this is rare footage,  but sincerely most of it is from the broadcast media, so hardly ""rare.""  And I have seen just about all of it.  Even the post year 2000 footage is BAD video, like it was shot from a cell phone with Vaseline on the camera lens.

ONLY FOR COMPLETE FREAKS LIKE ME.",1424217600,4,1088,4.437185929648241
8687470,1,B00PCSVNYM,"Garbage. Pixellated Youtube videos with practically no editing whatsoever. If you're any kind of fan, you've found this stuff online a long time ago. Crosby's interview with Bob Costas; the footage from the film ""Woodstock"" where CSN&Y play the song ""Woodstock."" CSN&Y doing Down By the River on TV. Horrible quality, all of it. The photo on the cover is better than anything on the disc. Zero stars.",1423699200,5,400,4.897058823529412
8687471,5,B00PCSVNYM,"Phenomenal unedited bootleg video.  Get to see great, uncut footage of this classic band during their prime.  Stills was at his peak (which was pretty darn close too Neil Young at this stage in his career).  Even Crosby and Nash are at their creative and performance peaks (while not at same level or artistry as Neil and Stephen) and demonstrate why these four collectively, were the superstars they were in the 1970's...",1422835200,3,422,4.833333333333333
