Each piece has an introduction that explains where in her career the piece was created, and what the influences were.  The range of dances is a true feast, covering dances inspired by such things as painting, travel, and mythology.  A treasure!!",1244851200,,353,4.85

The dancers are very strong, and give you a very good version of what the Graham Company was.
With Diversion of Angels, to Maple Leaf Rag, you will be able to get an idea of the Artist, Martha Graham, who brought Drama to Theater, and Dance.
Enjoy!",1019433600,,357,4.343283582089552
