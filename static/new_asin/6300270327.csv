303970,2,6300270327,"Robbo a.k.a. Robin (Frank Sinatra) is a 1920's era Chicago mob rival of Guy Gisborne (Peter Falk). They operate speakeasy casinos which serve booze via broads along with the little vice machines: slots, roulette, etc. Sinatra's mentor Big Jim (Edward G. Robinson, uncredited; we see his portrait in Robbo's office) has just been snatched from Chicago to go that big speakeasy in the sky thanks to a new sheriff in town. The film begins with a rather ""entertaining"" outdoor funeral/send off where Big Jim's fellas give him a last goodbye with some singing, throwing hats, and some pistol shots, Just like they used to do when Capone was pulling Chicago's underworld strings.

Now that Big Jim is gone, Guy Gisborne wants his operation to join with Robbo's so they can clean up the town, i.e. monopolize the gambling and the booze. Guy even says it would be better to be ""the best of friends rather than the worst enemies."" Robbo replies ""finish your drink"", meaning he's declined the offer. A new pool hustler, Little John, has come into town and wants to help Robbo with his operation. Sammy Davis Jr, has a role as one of Robbo's lackeys but, like Martin, contributes little to the actual story.

Turns out Guy is a sore loser and ransacks Robbo's speakeasy. Robbo then returns the favor. Okay, it's about a rivalry between two mob bosses. But then it gets cheesy. Interspersed with this mostly harmless but absolutely fantasized scenario of the 1920's gang wars are a lot of songs, mostly forgettable. ""All for One and One for All"" is sung by Falk and company at the funeral of Big Jim. ""Any Man Who Loves His Mother"" is sung by Dean Martin. Of course Davis has a song and dance routine where he shoots up booze bottles in ""Bang Bang"", and when Crosby enters the story, it's not long before he sings as well. A song which should be fast-forwarded is ""Don't be a Do-Badder"" in which he and the orphan boys don green Robin Hood hats and sing and dance.

Then Frankie, I mean Robbo, meets a beautiful blonde, Marian Stevens (Barbara Rush) who wants to see Robbo in private. Turns out she doesn't want a night out with Frankie. She's the daughter of Big Jim, willing to pay good money to hit whoever offed her father. The hit is carried out, but Robbo claims he had no part of it but ends with $50 G's (that's $50,000). He wants to return the money, which ends up in a charitable organization helping disadvantaged orphans run by none other than Bing Crosby as Minister Alan A. Dale. Robbo becomes an instant celebrity and labeled as the ""Robin Hood"" of Chicago for his charitable contributions.

It starts to ring of ""Guys and Dolls"" meets ""Going My Way"" and/or ""The Bells of St. Mary's"" (where Crosby played a catholic priest, Father O'Malley). ""My Kind of Town"", Sinatra's big solo, was nominated for ""Best Song"" but there's not a lot here to cheer about. The scenario didn't take itself seriously about midway.

The real standout is Peter Falk as Guy Gisborne but his role as the rival mob boss seems to have been cut in favor of endless and seemingly pointless song and dance routines. At one point Sinatra, Martin and Crosby do a song and dance routine, replete with hats and canes, as if they've been rehearsing for the latest Vaudeville show.

Not a bad premise wasted on an unbalanced if not occasionally annoying script. The musical idea essentially ruined the seriousness of the story. It still could have been a comedy-drama fantasy but adding the musical numbers clouded and crowded what could have been a decent story.",1516060800,,3530,4.667202572347267

303975,1,6300270327,"Review of Robin and the 7 Hoods
Hot Toasty Rag, September 14, 2017

As famous as this movie is supposed to be, I don't really recommend watching it. Chances are, youll only be watching it because you like Frank Sinatra and want to join the Rat Pack, but if you manage to sit through this two-hour debacle, youll try to withdraw your membership application.

To put it simply, everyone involved in this movie was having a really bad day. The songs, written by Sammy Cahn and James Van Heusen, were unspeakably awful and universally too slow in tempo. The one famous song to come out of it, My Kind of Town, felt like it had been slowed down by fifty percent. Dean Martin, though never accused of being a good actor, looked like he didn't know what was going on and that he could barely remember the minimal choreography. And if Sammy Davis, Jr. cant sell a song, nobody can. During the one horrible song he was given, he looked like he was giving a Jerry Lewis impression. Finally, Frank Sinatra, who once was full of pep and vigor as he tap danced alongside Gene Kelly, looked incredibly tired and angry. In nearly every scene, he looked like hed rather be anywhere else in the world. I wondered what could have happened to him during the filming, since it was obvious his mind was elsewhere, and after the film was over I read the backstory behind his very noticeably grumpy performance. Im sure if you read up on the film as I did, youll cut him some slack.

Robin and the 7 Hoods takes place during the 1920s, and Frank Sinatra and Peter Falk head up rival factions of a Chicago gang. While Frankie has the Rat Pack on his side, Peter has classic old timers like Harry Wilson and Allen Jenkins at his table. The best part of the film is the beginning, when the gang celebrates the birthday of gang-leader Edward G. Robinson. It really is a great five minutes, but the movie tumbles downhill immediately after that.",1505347200,,1917,4.4714285714285715

304183,5,6300270327,"Those who don't like this film (and that's okay), don't really ""get""
the film (and that's okay, too). It's a spoof. It's all tongue in
cheek. And it stars 4 tremendous stars -- Frank, Dean, Bing, and Sammy.
No, it's not Shakespeare. Nor is it supposed to be. It's just supposed
to be fun with some cool songs thrown in for good measure. Nothing
more. Nothing less. And, if you don't like the stars, this wouldn't
have been a movie for you to go see. But for the fans of those four big
time operators, this film is a ball.

Attention to detail sometimes makes a movie, and starting out a film
about Prohibition Era gangsters with a cameo of Edward G.
Robinson...well, that's paying attention to detail. The first musical
number (""All for One and One for All"") is a hoot as sung by that man
with the velvet voice -- Peter Falk. Of course he's a lousy singer;
that's the point. I don't even like Peter Falk, but he's perfect for
his role in this film.

Dean Martin's primary solo (""Any Man Who Loves His Mother"") is
hokey...and it's supposed to be...I'm not particularly enamored of
it...but it does show off his mellow voice nicely. It's also
interesting to watch Dean's subtle facial expressions in some of the
scenes, and you'll notice that he is often focusing all his attention
on Bing Crosby.

Sammy Davis' primary number (""Bang Bang"") shows off his vocal and tap
dancing abilities very well, although Sammy got a bit short-changed in
this film...and you'll note that he's the only main character without a
love episode.

But the best role of all -- though he doesn't appear until just about
halfway through the film -- belongs to Bing Crosby...a ""do-gooder"" with
some intentions that may be less than honorable. Crosby has 2 notable
numbers, one with some kids and the other the lead in ""Mister Booze"".
One can still see the old pro excelling even late in his life, and it's
a pleasure.

Of course, Frank Sinatra's big number here is ""My Kind Of Town"", one of
his signature songs.

Additional cast members do their jobs. I especially liked Robert Foulk as the original sheriff.  But the cameo appearance of all time -- short lived though it was, was Edward G. Robinson -- a classic touch.

You need to watch for little touches in the dialog that are quite clever. For example, the telephone number at one point is Garfield..."", in homage to John Garfield. Lots of little thing like that.

If there's one criticism I have is that the boys (Dean, Frank, Bing,
and Sammy) didn't take enough care in lip-syncing the songs, and even
some of the dialog. It's really quite noticeable and distracting.

This is a good film. Not one of the great musicals of the 40s or 50s,
but a rather pleasant romp with the Rat Pack. Have fun watching it.

The Warner Brothers Blu-Ray disc I purchased her on Amazon was an excellent transfer.",1454112000,4,2823,4.57029702970297

304313,5,6300270327,"This was a very enjoyable film and I'd love to see it as a stage musical.  Transporting the story of Robin Hood from Sherwood Forest to Chicago in the 1920's, it has Frank Sinatra as Robbo, Dean Martin as Little John ( with a pool game taking the place of their famous meeting-and-fight-with-quarterstaves-on-the bridge), Sammy Davis Jr., as Will Scarlett, and Bing Crosby as  Allen A. Dale. Peter Falk, Victor Buono, Edward G. Robinson, Barbara Rush, and a cast of recognizable faces from the 60's and 70's are available to make this a light-hearted, funny, and slightly zany rehashing of Robin Hood's rivalry with Guy Gisborne as rival mobsters trying to take over after the mob boss (Robinson) is killed at his own birthday party. Robbo as his friend, wants revenge, and Gisborne, as the instigator of the ""hit,"" merely wants to take over.

Good songs, and nothing too heavy in any way. A light-weight Robin Hood-meets-Guys and Dolls. Nice to get away from all the so-called comedies currently making the rounds, with their questionable taste in jokes, plenty of sexual innuendos, and four-letter words. I've seen this movie twice and no doubt will repeat again. Produced by Frank Sinatra, it harks back to a surprisingly more innocent time of script-writing, with songs by Nelson Riddle and Sammy Cahn, and an astounding number of uncredited cameos.",1424995200,,1353,4.977876106194691

304348,5,6300270327,"Come back with me children to the Sixties while the youth of America began opening their eyes with various hemp products and the new drug of choice LSD... and were beginning to suspect the military-industrial complex was much more evil than even Eisenhower had warned about (and still is), adults were unwinding with legal drugs in Vegas with the Rat Pack.  Comprised of shifting members (depending on Sinatra's legendary moods) they included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr, Joey Bishop, and intermittently, Peter Lawford and the forgotten unofficial mascot, Shirley MacClaine (other names have been floated around these by people since but they were peripherals only).  A gang of entertainers who'd figured out that what the American legal aged adult wanted was to 'fuh-get about it' all and have a good time, so that's what they gave them, a rip roaring good time. For almost a decade!  Individually Sinatra, Dino, and Sammy were Super Stars in their own right and Joey and Peter were hanger-ons benefiting greatly by the association  (though Bishop was well respected in Vegas itself as a great warm-up comedian).  MacClaine was an ingenue at the time (and to this day a lot of people don't know she's Warren Beatty's sister).  I bring all this up because it is the reason this movie got made.  The Rat Pack put an already popular Vegas on the map for all time and were the greatest draws Vegas ever had, with the exception of Elvis Presley who was headed down that road soon after the Rat Pack went their ways.  The heyday was 1960 to 1964 and during that time Hollywood knew a good thing when it saw it in the Vegas concert halls and churned out four Rat Pack movies.  They are in order - Oceans 11 (1960) - Sergeants 3 (1962) - 4 For Texas (1963 - and culminating in the movie we are concerned with here - Robin And The 7 Hoods - 1964.

The four movies were to capture the chemistry that made the Rat Pack so entertaining and put it up on the screen with stories that focused on a little action, a little humor, and some song and dance thrown in at the end.  Oceans 11 is the most serious endeavor and it never strays far from the humor, Sergeants 3 is out and out slapstick out West, and 4 for Texas panders to the two major  movie Stars (Frank & Dino) sense of macho, song, and again...humor.  With pretty women featured prominently in all.

By the fourth movie the Rat Pack pictures which were very popular at the time had warranted a big budget treatment and into the mix an additional legend was added...Bing Crosby.  It's a movie about Mobsters and mayhem in the twenties and features the very lovely Barbara Rush as the femme fatale (and the label says it all).  It's loaded with Classic musical numbers and is the only out and out musical of the four movies.  Sinatra sings ""Chicago"", Sammy dances up a storm, and the only screen appearance by Crosby, Sinatra, & Martin singing together (You've Either Got Or You Haven't Got 'Style'!).  Sammy Davis, Jr has a couple of numbers that will knock your socks off at how multi-talented he was!!  The story involves the usual mobster machinations with our intrepid heroes trying to front a charity to bring in ready cash.

The budget allowed for a veritable herd of old school Hollywood character actors to be rounded up and put to marvelous use.  For those of you who remember Peter Falk before Columbo, sit back and marvel as he sings!!  He's the pack's biggest threat.  The wonderful Victor Bueno (who's entire career seems to have run from 1960 to 1968 before he died way too early, is the buffoonish sheriff to be.  Don't miss the un-billed cameo by one fo the greatest Ganster Stars of the 30's and the one who started it all!!  And the aforementioned Barbara Rush holding her own in a man's world with a surprise in store for them all.  Where is Bing Crosby in all of this you may ask?  Well he's brought in to legitimize the charity that Sinatra and the gang set up and he does a marvelous turn.

Many have dismissed this movie as just another Rat Pack movie but they miss the boat.  It's a full fledged musical extravaganza featuring some of the Sixties greatest singers singing wonderful songs, in great set pieces, surrounded by 'A' talent all the way.  It's fun, It's foot tapping time, and it's a part of Americana we will not see the likes of again!!!  For a great evening of entertainment for the whole family (all the adult stuff is wink wink nudge nudge - so the kids are safe) it doesn't get any better than this!!!",1422403200,20,4503,4.5496277915632755

304354,4,6300270327,"The critics hated ""Robin and the Seven Hoods"", but now it's available on dvd anyway so everyone can still enjoy all the fun.

First--great cast. Sinatra was one of the producers and decided to follow up the Rat Pack hit ""Ocean's Eleven"" (where it all began, pre-Clooney), with a musical about two rival mob bosses in Chicago--Guy Gisborne (Peter Falk, delightfully hammy) and ""Robbo"", the hood with a heart, played by Sinatra with his usual low key swagger and machismo.

Along for the ride are his ""merry men""--Davis, in his usual talented-but-abused-flunky role and Dean Martin, as a familiar, suavely relaxed, slightly boozy hood. Sinatra's crooks aren't really such bad guys, they just want to make money from gambling. But Falk's mob (including Victor Buono) are ruthless bad guys who, in the first scene, even kill off the loveable boss of ALL of them, Robbo's friend, Edward G. Robinson, in the event that sets the two mob leaders left at odds with each other.

Barbara Rush is Robinson's beautiful daughter, who comes in wanting revenge and stays to romance...just about everyone.

But it's not really about the plot, it's about the star turns everyone gets along the way. Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen provide some great tunes and every Rat Pack-er gets a musical solo. Davis is good as always, singing and dancing his way through ""Bang-Bang"". Martin gets to sing a ballad for mothers, ""But a Boy Who Loves His Mother"" showing these are not your typical hoods.

The best performances, of course, go to Sinatra and Crosby. Sinatra performs his song solo, the now-classic ""My Kind of Town"" (written for this film) as the show-stopper it is.  Crosby doesn't get as memorable a solo, but he performs his tuneful number while singing and dancing a bit with orphans--so, bringing the charm and warmth he's known for. The film's lucky to have him because the energy really brightens when Crosby arrives mid-way. His acting is so superior to any of the Rat Pack's in this, low key but with authority. He brings humor, handles comedy, of course, as expertly as drama. And can sing great. And even dances.

My favorite number was ""Style""--a very catchy effort by Sinatra, Martin and Crosby, where the first two try to remake the stodgy Crosby when he first joins them. Very fun number, just like the film.",1417737600,,2306,4.822784810126582

He was his usual delightful self, although he was the main baddie, Guy Gisbourne.  The Rat Pack was as great as I expected, although I was surprised at how bored and disinterested Sinatra (as Robbo) seemed to be through most of the production, except in the musical numbers.  However, I discovered via the included special commentary by Sinatra Jr. on the DVD, that the production was troubled by the assassination of JFK and then the kidnapping of said Sinatra Jr., so that could have had a lot to do with it.  Everyone else looked like they were having a ball, again, especially in the musical numbers.  Sammy Davis Jr. (Will Scarlett) had the most energetic one with ""Bang Bang"", where he got to not only sing, but dance to my heart's content!  I love a great dance routine, and his ranks with the best.  Overall, the movie was great fun.  Got it in the mail only a day ago, and I've already watched it 3 times!

For my money, this is a much better film than the Rat Pack's Oceans 11, partly because it was less self-indulgent, and well, it felt like they put more work and thought into it. If nothing else, it is one of the cleverest adaptations of the Robin Hood legend I've ever seen. Take the first meeting of Robin and Little John, for example, as they battle it out with the 1920s version of quarter staffs. Even the part where Richard essentially ""regains the throne,"" shall we say, but in another form, was very drolly done.

Despite all this and the brilliant writing, it's the songs really that are the showpiece. ""Mr. Booze"", ""Style,"" ""Don't Be a Do-Badder,"" and of course ""My Kind of Town"" are all standouts.

Frank, Dean and Sammy did their version of Robin Hood. Supporting them in this film were Barbara Rush, a pre-Columbo-ed Peter Falk and Bing (White Christmas) Crosby.  This film reminds me of Sinatra's Guys and Dolls

The story is a gangstered 1920's ish, Chicago mob story with music. The Rats are minus Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop, but you won't miss them in the romp. Crosby does a sendup on his image in a trio song with Sinatra and Martin. Sammy solos in Bang! Bang!, showing tap dancing and GUNS can go together in the hand of a master showman. Falk steals every scene he is in with such aplomb, you wonder why he did not do many more comedy.

the Sammy Cahn score, orchestered by Nelson Riddle is first rate and pure Sinatra with songs like My Kinda Town Chicago.

Extras include Frank Sinatra jr audio commentary, which gives great insights into the film itself and its making

305096,5,6300270327,"Dismissed by many as overly-long, poorly-scripted Rat Pack self-indulgence with inferior musical material, ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" is a wacky mafia musical in the fun-loving style of pre-Hammerstein Broadway variety shows, and with a pretty snappy collection of Cahn-Van Heusen tunes.  Remember, it's this musical, not ""Chicago,"" that gave the Windy City its proudest anthem.  But as solid as the Chairman's performance is, it's almost no match for Crosby's, in the venerable crooner's next-to-last film appearance.

Once Bing appears mid-way through the film, the rest of the picture--with the exception of the""My Kind of Town"" gala finish--belongs to Crosby.  His acting, singing, and dancing not only outshine his on-screen companions' but ihelp bring order to the proceedings, practically making the somewhat slipshod Rat Pack appear like a coherent musical comedy team.  At five foot seven inches, Bing was usually the shortest member on the set, but his crisp, economical body movements and quick, graceful feet make him ""play"" taller than his actual height.

The dubbing is, as others have observed, pretty unconvincing.  On the other hand, most of the dance and music scenes are shot continuously in a single take or two, like an Astaire film.  Others may prefer the frenetic and manipulative MTV editing style of films like ""Chicago,"" which permit the filmmaker to edit a ""constructed reality"" while transforming Bozos into Baryshnikovs.  I'll take these lovable Bozos just as they are (though a Blu Ray version is certainly overdue).",1062374400,53,1543,5.3429752066115705

The highlight is as vulgar as it is mind-numbing: Sammy Davis Jr.'s rat-a-tat-tatting number in which he dances with various guns, blowing away this and that and offering Sammy Cahn-Jimmy Van Heusen's genius as proof that musical numbers can sometimes silence an audience, if only until their jaws lock back in place.

The voices are wonderful and the plot is funny!  If you want to see a good movie with a few laughs and some good songs, buy this now!  It is a treasure!",997401600,4,308,3.765625
305102,3,6300270327,"Not long before this started shooting, there was a major rift in the rat pack, and because of that, only three members (Martin, Davis, and Sinatra, of course) show up here. The other two roles were filled in, and quite  ably, by Peter Falk and Bing Crosby. And if you like rat pack-style music,  having ensemble numbers with Frank, Dean, and Bing is something you're  gonna love.

The last half of this movie is good. It ain't Oceans  Eleven, but it's good. Too bad the first half moves slower than a snail on  ludes. Crosby doesn't show up until an hour into the film, and the action  starts right there; before that, what the movie needs most is an editor who  isn't afraid of Sinatra. It does, however, have some fine music (Sinatra  debuted ""My Kind of Town"" here), and once it picks up, it's a lot  of fun. Watch it when it comes on AMC, but spend the first half hour or so  going to the store to get munchies.",961286400,6,915,4.292397660818714
305103,4,6300270327,"They were legends in their best venue. Sinatra, Martin and Davis. Singing, dancing and vamping up a storm. Throw in Crosby and great character performances by Falk, Buono and Rush, and you have great entertainment  value!
On the few occasions when the film bogs down, a Sammy Cahn tune is  there to save the day. Each of the stars gets a fine solo shot. Sinatra's  MY KIND OF TOWN is best known but Davis"" BANG BANG is reminiscent of  the best of Astaire and Dino's ANY MAN WHO LOVES HIS MOTHER should have  become a Mother's day classic standard. (it's not too late either if the  public would just get to hear the soundtrack version without the films  comedy gimmick that accompanies it.)
A little long, but that is the only  drawback. Terrific entertainment and easily the best of the ""Rat  Pack"" films.",961113600,19,806,4.580419580419581
305104,4,6300270327,"How could the best Rat Pack movie not be the only one in the bunch that's a musical?  Frankly, it just tears me up that there's no soundtrack album available for this movie - Frank, Dino and Bing's trio, ""Stlye""  is marvellous, ""Chicago"" is, of course, part of the standard  Sinatra catalogue by this point, the silly-fun production number ""Mr.  Booze"" is nice (if a bit reminiscent of ""Sit Down You're Rocking  the Boat"" from ""Guys and Dolls""), plus a few other fun  little throwaway songs, and you've got yourself one heck of a muscial.  Add  to the songs the fact that Sinatra, Martin, Sammy and Bing are all  wonderful actors who are clearly having fun with their roles, and it's a  heck of a movie.",948844800,2,703,4.507936507936508
