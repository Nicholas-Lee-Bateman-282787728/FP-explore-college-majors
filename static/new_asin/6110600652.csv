He has finished school and is now 37, just beginning his internship at a university hospital.  He chose to become a doctor for various reasons, including the desire to help his fiancee who is suffering from kidney failure and is unable to speak due to an accident.  During his internship, he influences his fellow interns, goes head to head with his superiors, and shows the unique perspective of someone who is coming into a new field as a full adult.
