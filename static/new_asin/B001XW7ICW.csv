3829165,5,B001XW7ICW,"Precis of the show: An art major working as a temp on the reception desk of a genetics lab is caught up in a mishap that leads to her being recruited as an agent-in-training by a uniformed man (no, not officially uniformed like a cop or a mountie, and not spandexed and/or masked like Batman or the Lone Ranger; think 1950's Army knock-off, starting with the Eisenhower jacket) who introduces himself as ""The Middleman"", a secret agent working for a secret agency with a secret agenda to save the world and to fight evil no matter where it is found (so that we ""don't have to"").

Before she knows it, our temp receptionist, Wendy Watson, is in the middle of the adventure of a life-time, fighting evil right along-side the Middleman (aka MM). And what adventures they are: fighting aliens from space disguised as the members of a boy band, collaborating -- or not -- with vampires who run a fashion company, entering Hades to prevent world destruction, dealing with evil alter-egos in an alternative universe, etc, etc, etc... and many of these adventures are handled before breakfast. Figuratively speaking, that is.

""The Middleman"" is a loving parody/spoof of just about every genre any fan has ever been deeply, madly, eternally in love with... and I should know, 'cause I'm that way about all of them: most obviously, of course, is the general SF category -- but within this genre there are also the ""robots are our friends -- or are they?"" genre, the ""invaders from space walk amongst us"" genre, the ""secret masters of the universe"" genre, the ""alternate universe"" genre, the ""Batman&Robin"" genre, the... but why go on? If you're an SF fan, chances are you'll immediately recognize one or more of your favorite ""what ifs"" in every episode of ""The Middleman.""

And that's NOT to say that this show is derivative or recycled. On the contrary, Javier Grillo-Maxauch, the creator of ""The Middleman"", (who quite obviously is the SF Fan Supreme) has given every ""what-if"", every ""do you suppose"", every ""could it be"" that form the basis of all good SF tales those special little JG-M twists that raise his premises from ""gosh darn good"" (to paraphrase MM himself) to truly outstanding.

So. You start with a great concept; add exceptional writing (and, may I say, writing that was much too adult for ABC Family, the cable station that aired the episodes and dropped them after only twelve episodes); follow with casting that is absolutely spot-on for each character (I mean, even with the great writing, many actors would fail to make the Middleman anything other than a Dudley Do-right caricature, but Matt Keesler makes his nameless MM a three dimensional person -- even if he *does* drink milk and eschew any language more colorful than ""heck"" or ""darn""); and finally, have directors who know how to handle parody and satire without making it so ""over-the-top"" that it fails to connect. The result will be that you have a timeless series.

I was hooked right from the start of the first episode, when Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), our soon-to-be Middleman-in-training (Middlewoman? Middleperson? Middlebeing?), was completely unflappable in the midst of being attacked by a composite monster created in a genetics experiment gone wrong: ""Andromeda Strain"" sub-genre, of course. And I was *really* hooked the first time we met Wendy's roommate, Lacey Thornfield (Brit Morgan), and realized that in these two young women Grillo-Maxauch had given us two strong female roles unlike any others on TV.

And yes, with gorgeous guys and beautiful women on display, the romance genre is definitely on view here, in all its permutations: true love, unrequited love, love denied, love willingly embraced, etc, etc, etc. Interestingly, the requisite UST (unresolved sexual tension, for those who don't recognize the initials) in this show is not between MM and Wendy, but rather between MM and Lacey (who would really much rather NOT have her love be unrequited, thank you very kindly -- and I agree, which is why I adore the twist in the final episode which does, and yet doesn't, resolve the unresolvable).

So, we have both the SF and the romantic fiction genres in this show. What else? There's enough action-adventure to please any fan of the genre, enough friendship to satisfy any buddy-movie fan (the relationship between Wendy and MM and between Wendy and Lacey both qualify in this category), and enough ""secret shadow government/agency"" shticks to grab the Bourne audience -- provided they're willing to accept humor in the plots to take over the world.

I loved the show so much, I paid $1.99 per episode from i-tunes ""just in case"" the show never made it to DVD. But even with all the episodes sitting on my computer, I'm *still* gonna shell out the money to pick this set up as soon as it's released. The Middleman needs his fans.",1237507200,118,4837,4.897435897435898

3829238,5,B001XW7ICW,"The show itself is one of my absolute favorites of all time. It really feels like a comic book come to life, which seems appropriate given the story's origin. But in this crazy world of giant purple tentacle monsters and talking gorilla mafiosos the characters are still grounded and complex with very believable relationships and chemistry. It's a lovely mix of absurd, manic humor and with a genuine emotional core. It's a series that I've found myself re-watching over and over and over again. I can't recommend this enough.

In terms of the dvd itself, the packaging is very handsomely made and the Truth Bomb insert is a really cool touch. The art on the insides of the dvd cases is also excellent and shows off some of the great art design work that was put into small touches like the fake badges that they would flash on the show.",1411948800,2,838,4.586666666666667

3829249,5,B001XW7ICW,"The best way I can describe The Middleman is Torchwood meets Scott Pilgrim. There is SO MUCH geek reference to be found in this fun little series that you'll find yourself chuckling at the near audacity with which the characters banter about things obviously meant to catch the ear of those of us who enjoy the weirder things in life. The DVDs supplement this with fun extras which are sure to provide some nostalgia for lovers of the series, and make us miss the potential that was there even more. I suppose the most shocking thing about this whole thing is that it was borne of a family network, but has as much subtle smut innuendo as I've seen on an American cable show.",1378080000,,675,4.451612903225806

I love this show and really wish there were more of it.",1377043200,,348,4.453125
3829252,5,B001XW7ICW,"This is one of the funniest & most entertaining TV series I've ever seen. I wasn't aware of its existence during its brief run in 2008 - thank goodness for DVDs! There are only 12 episodes, but they're all great! - not a bad one in the bunch. In addition to the over-the-top humor, I like the growth of the relationship (which is NOT a sexual one) between Wendy and The Middleman - how their bonding develops. They have a good supporting cast, and great guest stars as well.
The Middleman, played by Matt Keeslar, is a combination of secret agent & superhero (altho he doesn't wear a cape, tights, nor diaper). His mandate is to solve exotic problems, and deal with threats infra-, extra-, and juxta-terrestrial. In this he is ably assisted by new recruit & sidekick, Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales, who is the real center of the show), and robot IDA (Internet Data Accessor ?), played by Mary Pat Gleason. Their opponents include mad scientists, aliens, vampire puppets, and on one occasion even a rogue Middleman.
A superhero show with a delightful difference!",1374105600,3,1061,4.7405405405405405

He puts his side kick in her place when she uses her potty mouth, however, he knows she always has his back. The story lines are so left field however, the actors really pull it off. I usually watch it every couple of months and is always a delight.",1363219200,,527,4.227722772277228
3829270,5,B001XW7ICW,"The Middleman is about this super hero guy called the Middleman and his Middleman in training, who happens to be female. They work for an organization they refer to as O2STK (Organization Too Secret To Know), and that's just the tip of the awesome that is this show. The fact that the villains are continually saying, ""My plan is sheer elegance in its simplicity,"" as they monologue about their convoluted schemes to take over the world (or destroy it) is frosting goodness.

It's a tongue-in-cheek look at pop culture that pokes fun at it while simultaneously celebrating it. The far too few episodes tend to revolve around a specific theme and are full of references to the pop culture landmarks that inspired them. However, don't mistake my praise for the show as being any kind of suggestion that you should rush out and watch it. In all likelihood, you shouldn't. By the second episode, I was fully aware of why Middleman got cancelled.

It's not that it's too intelligent for the average viewer, although it is. Despite it's campy appearance (yes, it does wear camp clothes, dressing itself up to resemble the Batman series of the 60s with such things as the Middlemobile), it is, in many ways, too sophisticated for the average viewer. If you can't catch the subtleties, you'll just think it's silly. To make matters worse, if you're not pretty well grounded in your pop culture lore, the vast majority of the jokes will go right over your head. There's nothing worse than a joke you don't get in a show meant to be funny. And, if it's meant to be funny, and you're only getting every 3rd or 4th joke, you tend to, well, think it's not funny. It's like being the person in the room staring at Monty Python and the Holy Grail with a glazed expression while everyone else laughs uncontrollably.

So... it's not a show I can actually recommend, but I liked it so much, I needed to write about it. The sad part is that it did have some really interesting sub-plots developing, and we'll never know what was to come of them. The only real reason I could suggest watching it is if you really wanted to know how off center I am. Either you'd get the show, and say ""oh, wow, this is great,"" in which case you would be revealed to be off center, too, or you'd make the yuck face and think (or, maybe, even say out loud), ""He likes this? What's wrong with him?""

Of course, Middleman did get a fairly good critical reaction. Like Arrested Development. But, when everything comes down to how much money it can generate, the bits on either end of the bell curve (the great and the horrible) become indistinguishable to the profit gurus. Which is just too bad, because everything becomes the same old bland mass market crap. White rice, white bread, and white TV. Read anything you want into that statement. I'm sure you won't be wrong.",1357344000,,2830,4.575936883629192

3829272,5,B001XW7ICW,"Creativity has different measures and can be expressed on different orders. A novel or film or television series may be utterly novel in its basic conception -- characters, setting, story arc. Each may also demonstrate imaginative texture, displayed in the fine details, some of which may escape detection. On the surface, The Middle Man appears interesting but not that singular -- if one wanted to be quickly dismissive and move on, it would suffice to characterize both the show and the comic book series upon which it's based as nothing more than a straight copycat of Men in Black: A skilled operator and his novice sidekick put out a fire each week that is either caused by aliens, magic or some science experiment gone horribly wrong. Here, though, the charm lies in the details -- the snappy dialogue and culturally-referenced throwaway lines. When in the pilot episode one character expresses a liking for the comic book character of The Flash and the other asks, Barry Allen or Wally West, then you know this adventure will include a rollicking ride through the contemporary zeitgeist, somewhat akin to a toned-down viewing of Mystery Science Theatre 3000. The show obviously did not enjoy a large budget, and as befits such a series the characters are very comic book-y but still possess some substance and personality. It's a shame the whole thing went only twelve episodes, but this is one series that can bear repeated watching, followed by even more watching. Listen for the Wilhelm scream. Savor the give and take in the dialogue. Dig for more cultural references. Just sit back and enjoy it. Rollicking indeed.",1352332800,,1627,4.9633699633699635

So I decided to buy the DVD, making my watching and enjoying official and legal. It did take a whole month to arrive. Reason?
The Rapacious Administration Impediment:
Apparently the Customs didn't like it much, took their time with it and fined me a whole third of the price because the ""Goods Do Not Meet The Requirements of Article 9 and 10 Of The Contract For The Foundation Of The European Community"" as it says on the yellow sticker. (Google doesn't help much there). Apparently it means ""You Must Pay Taxes Because We Say So, Because It Was Not Made In Europe"". A bit harsh considering the Middleman didn't cross the Atlantic. I'm already worried at the idea of how badly it would have been dubbed in French.

At least, the DVDs are very good, and the Bonus part is really worth it. Such a shame there isn't more. Some people have no taste.",1345507200,,1048,4.481675392670157

This show just never gets old to me. The creators, writers, producers and actors went under-recognized for their talent and for their work on this project. What a shame. It was only thirteen episodes long but I continue to come back to it when I need something like comfort. It's so sharp, funny, witty, innocent yet poking fun at itself and all it's references...lovingly, appreciatively and with nothing over-done.

The Middlemen is quite cheesy. But in the best way possible. Full of wonderfully quirky humor, attractive lead characters, comic book styled goodness (in the vein of the 1960s Batman movie and TV series), and numerous self-references (""My plan is elegance in its simplicity...""), The Middlemen is a winner.

Not every episode is perfection, but they're all solid. The season is mostly comprised of stand alone episodes, but as we near the seasons end, an arc begins to form. Unfortunately the show was canceled before any real resolution could have developed from that, but I didn't mind all that much because I was glad to have even the twelve episodes that I had.

Clever campy humor not seen since the original Batman series, wacky gadgetry, and several episodes make humorous parallels to other classic shows/movies including Star Trek, Escape from NY, etc.

This is one of the Best TV series created -- unfortunately it aired on ABC Family.  A bad match for this type of show, which contains more mature humor and references to pop culture including regular allusions to MJ (mostly uttered by Ida, the android secretary/office manager, directed towards Wendy).

I plan on buying a few copies and sending them to my friends.

I believe that part of the charm that I have found in the series has been that the attitude of the main characters is that they behave as if it was not a comedy (or satire sometimes) but, instead, the aprticipants of a serious film involving a old (?) mostly centered master (The Middleman) trying to train a young apprentice (Wendy Watson). I also believe that they did a good review of the different plots of several kind of movies in the last couple of decades (science fiction, spionage, zombies, vampires... even some references to westrens).

3829302,4,B001XW7ICW,"What a neat little show!  I watched the pilot when it came out and then got too busy to keep up with it.  But I had heard good things about it and had retained an intention to see it.  I like to watch shows that I missed the first time around as well as rewatching shows on DVD.  I just finished rewatching all of the STAR TREK shows, which was a pretty long and ongoing project.  I haven't decided what long series I will be watching next so I'm watching a few short series in the interim.  I'm delighted to have seen this one.

I read a lot of comics but I have not read THE MIDDLEMAN, so my first acquaintance with this universe came with these episodes.  I frankly was not blown away by the show like many of the reviewers here.  I would not put this on the list of the greatest series I've seen this year, let alone ever.  But it is a sweet, quirky, adorable series that I would very much like to have watched over a four or five year period.

I absolutely loved Natalie Morales in the female lead in the show.  The worst thing about the show's cancellation is not being able to see her again on a regular basis.  Hopefully she'll get snatched up by another show or a bunch of movies.  I was not as fond of Matt Keeslar in the title role.  He was OK, but didn't endear himself to me as much as he should have as a lead character.  Part of the problem was that he didn't have a chance to loosen up enough.  We got hints of how his character might have evolved in what sadly turned out to be the series finale.  In that he does a great impersonation of Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell's character in ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK) and, as they say, hilarity ensues.

All in all, a neat little show.  It seems that each year the list of the shows that have been cancelled that I regret having been cancelled grows and grows.  Still, I am happy that we got at least one season of this show than none at all.",1263945600,3,1896,4.0978260869565215

3829305,5,B001XW7ICW,"New series come and go, but rarely do they impress. Sometimes you have an intriguing setting, sometimes you have great production values. Once in a blue moon you have really solid writing. Most of the time, you have crap. In an average sitcom the actors could trade scripts with each other and no-one would notice since they all sound the same. If you have (pop)culture references you also get low-brow guffaws. Everyone aims for a lowest common denominator.
Except these guys.
Halfway through Ep 1 I called around to my friends and explained that I was watching the most impressive new series I have seen in a decade. The script was smart. The characters were smart. They were also good-looking, but not in the ""photoshop and plasticine"" way that most young stars are. These are people you could -almost- meet on the street, just a little smarter and prettier. You could actually relate to them without sneering.
Every new character has something unique to contribute. This series really needs to be renewed, because some of them have not had the chance to be explored yet. It also needs to be renewed because it is insanely great and we miss it.
After the fifth episode I was actually shedding tears, mostly because I laughed so hard where I laughed out loud. Using normal studio wits, something this good just had to be cancelled since it made the other offerings look so much worse. Just like ""Firefly"", this was just too good. So I decided to buy it AT ONCE when it came out on DVD. Send the studio a message.

What I hope for now is what you might call the ""extreme episode continuation"", where someone with cash picks up this (almost) cancelled masterpiece and gives it another chance. If that takes another year while someone hones the scripts to perfection, so be it. I can wait, as long as I know it is coming back. These people have become my friends. The kind of friends that never say stupid things, look good, and have huge knowledge of cool things, and in a couple of cases really great legs as a bonus. Or the physique of a greek god.
This series will stand the test of time. It will build a following of such rabidness that the trekkers pale in comparison, and I think it will sell for decades. If the powers that be have any kind of wits, they will spend the money for another season or three just to increase their long-term winnings, while they also increase our watching pleasure.",1254441600,,2401,4.5707656612529

3829309,5,B001XW7ICW,"I guess that this show being canceled finally proves once and for all that there's really no intelligent life in TV management.

Seriously, although there have been many great shows on TV like Battlestar Galactica and Firefly (another gem that got the axe) it's the first time in ages that there's a show that I can watch the same episode over and over again and not get tired. It's like when I was a kid watching reruns of Star Trek and Lost in Space. It didn't matter how many times I watched an episode, it never grew old. They say nothing is perfect, but so far I haven't found a single flaw here. Everything about this show is great. The brilliant scripts, the intentionally cheesy FX, not to mention the cast.

Although everyone is, to put simply, perfect, I must say that in an ideal world where actors were judged by their performances and not by the type of show they are in (Sci-fi, action), Matt Keeslar's performance would certainly had won him an Emmy and a Golden Globe. People usually think that great performances are the ones that make you cry. Those are good too, but it takes a great actor to play a character like The Middleman and make it not only believable but likable and above all, serious. Yes, serious, because it would be extremely easy to play the character as a caricature. Instead, we see a character who shows the audience that a man can be polite, honest and true, and still be cool. Kudos.

Speaking about show cancellations again, if you consider the large number of great shows that got canceled in the past few years, some of them with quite a following, against the large number of shows that SHOULD HAVE BEEN canceled it's obvious that TV executives should rethink the way they are selecting the cancellations.

As for The Middleman, I can only hope that somehow, this show sells so well that some TV executive proves me wrong and get this show back on the air. If you haven't watched this show yet, you really may believe what everyone here is saying, and the only reason not to buy this DVD set is if, like me, you are waiting for the Blu-ray release.",1253318400,,2092,4.497368421052632
3829310,5,B001XW7ICW,"The Middleman's auspicious debut on ABC Family was not as auspicious as many would have liked. It languished in the ratings while, shall we say, less-than-original fare such as ""Secret Life of the American Teenager swelled in popularity. I don't know that ABCF did any more or less than most basic cable programmers to promote the show, but I feel at least grateful that they were behind the show as much as they were content-wise. It just wasn't a good fit for their network, it seems. Then again, I can't tell you anyplace else that would have swung the bat on the series.
Like an update of the brilliantly batty superhero-coms of the '60s (Adam West's Batman or The Green Hornet) The Middleman is an odd duck of humor and heroics, mixing less than state of the art effects with cutting edge humor to create a potent cocktail the likes of which won't be seen again.
So the show is great; now what? Fortunately, Shout Factory is one media conglomerate that knows how to treat the ""brilliant-but-cancelled"" genre of television.
While this particular release might not contain the glory that was their perfect Freaks and Geeks set, this is the best I could have ever seen The Middleman getting. You receive commentaries from cast and crew, promotional materials, and a clip package that puts all the ""Wilhelm Screams"" used on the show in one handy-dandy, easy to digest burrito of justice.

3829311,5,B001XW7ICW,"This is probably the best show you never heard of.  Wry humor and pop culture references abound in this hard to classify show (Natalie Morales herself describes it as Men in Black meets Get Smart) about artist Wendy Watson, who shares a loft in an illegal co-op with another photogenic young artist, Lacey Thornfield.  Wendy (played with perfection by the very photogenic Morales) has suffered a string of boring temp jobs, culminating with receptionist at a science lab, where an experiment gone wrong creates a multi-eyed monster.  Enter The Middleman (square jawed, even keeled Matt Keesler) who disposes of said monster.  Liking the way Wendy handles herself during the crisis, he recruits her to be his partner.  Thus begins a thrilling comic ride as Wendy and the Middleman battle gun-slinging apes, zombie trout, Mexican wrestlers, evil boy bands, loser ex-boyfriends, art plagiarists, cursed tubas, devious sorority girls, and alternate universes, all chock-full of sly references to Ghostbusters, Escape from New York, classic sci-fi, and whatever else creator Javier Grillo-Marxuach had floating around in his brain.

The cast and characters are simply top-notch: The Middleman himself, Wendy Watson, activist roommate Lacey, sarcastic robot Ida, slacker guitarist Noser, too good to be true boyfriend Tyler Ford, Sensei Ping . . .

I could go on and on about this show, the cast, the writing.  Unfortunately, The Middleman appears doomed to one season and cult status, as ABC Family decided not to renew the series, despite solid critical reviews.  So we'll never know how great this show could have gotten, or what really happened to Wendy's father.  And that really steams my clams.

3829313,5,B001XW7ICW,"The Middleman is like a TV ode to genre media, crafted with comedy.

The series is set in a world where comic book, TV and movie-style mad scientists, aliens, monsters, and ghosts are all real.  The Middleman and Middleman-in-training Wendy Watson are the ones who deal with the problems and keep them out of the public eye.  The threats include such variety as:  super-intelligent gangster apes, fish-obsessed zombies, a haunted sorority house, a boy-band of exiled alien dictators and many others.

The series is definitely tongue-in-cheek, but takes things seriously within the structure of the show (similar to the Men in Black movies).  It lacked a large budget, but the limitations don't really affect the show itself most of the time.

While I applaud ABC Family for making the series, the show didn't really fit on the network.  Yes, The Middleman can be considered to be a ""family show"", but I don't think it really fit alongside all the tweeny dramas and old sitcoms... and so failed to gain the audience it deserved.  I still hold a nugget of hope somewhere that it could follow in the footsteps of Firefly and Family guy somehow and make a return.

A geeky aspiring artist working a temp job at a bio-engineering plant is attacked by a many-armed monstrous genetic anomaly. Unfazed, she reaches for a paperknife and slices off its tentacle.  It is her composure under pressure that signals to the Dragnet-inspired ""middleman,"" who arrives at the knick of time to finish off the monster, that she just may have the right stuff to become his new partner.  Sure enough, she gets recruited as the slacker side-kick to this uptight and upright gadget-wielding hero as a ""middleman,"" solving strange and unusual crimes for an unnamed and unseen organization.

3829319,5,B001XW7ICW,"""The Middleman"" is a 12-episode television series which aired on abc family and is based on the Viper Comics series created by Javier Grillo-Marxuach (""Medium"",
""Lost"" and ""Jake 2.0') and Les McClaine (""Highway 13' and ""Jonny Crosbones"").

The series received positive reviews from critics for its geek culture and parody of classic superhero and sci-fi shows but also a little ""Men in Black"" and ""Get Smart"" and fans of Javier's work with ""LOST"" and the comic book series help give the series some hype with their fans.  To also give the series its zany and outrageous nature as seen on the comic books, Grillo-Marxuach has said that abc family were open to all ideas and let the crew become creative for each episode.

Unfortunately, part of the problem is that abc family has not been strong among its viewers for its sci-fi shows (despite the show being very supportive of sci-fi) and both ""Kyle XY"" and ""The Middleman"" despite positive critic reviews, were unable to gather strong enough ratings and both were unfortunately canceled.  All twelve episodes of ""The Middleman"" aired on abc family from June through September 2008.

But ""The Middleman"" continues to live on through its comic book series from Viper Comics and for the fans of the series, Shout Factory/abc family have released ""The Middleman - The Complete Series"" which is jam packed with special features.

The TV series revolved around a struggling artist named Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales) who lives with her friend Lacey Thornfield (Brit Morgan), another struggling artist in an illegal sublet.  One day, while looking for a job, Wendy Watson finds herself in a local laboratory where a science experiment has gone wrong.  She is then introduced to The Middleman (Matt Keeslar).

Wendy is then offered to become a Middleman herself and through training, joins the Middleman and his crotchety android assistant Ida (Mary Pat Gleason) combing the city and stopping/capturing supernatural beings.

  * EPISODE 12 - The Palindrome Reversal Palindrome - Wendy gets caught up in a time singularity and end ups in a Bizzaro World where the world is different.  Now Wendy must find a way to get home.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Middleman"" was shot on HD (1080i) and for the most part, the series looks good for a television series on DVD.  For the most part, the series looks very good on DVD, especially the outdoor shots which the series does have quite a lot.  The final episode looks great but again, another HD series that I wish would receive a Blu-ray HD transfer.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital Surround.  Audio also plays an integral part as the sound effects play into the enjoyability of the show.  For instance, fans of ""The Wilhelm Scream"" will find it almost as a game to spot the scream on each episode.

Overall, picture and audio quality were well-done for ""The Middleman"" for its DVD release.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I absolutely enjoyed ""The Middleman"" series.  Its humor, its absurdity, its campiness which was all intentional in order to make a fun series about superheroes who must go after the supernatural.  Where you can find a series where its two heroes have to take on a killer fish, terra cotta warriors, stop vampire domination?

With so many sci-fi series so serious, it was great to have a series that had a delightful and yet not so serious, but fun and campy storyline and have a network supportive of its style and also the creator in his ability to produce something that is rare for television.

What I enjoyed the most is the various pop culture reference.  May it be Wendy talking about comic books (who can not love a comment about enjoying the classic X-Men and not the Ultimate X-Men series and whether or not a person enjoys Barry Allen or Wally West version of ""The Flash""), to ""Star Trek"" and playing Castlevania on her old school Gameboy, there are so many of these references that will put a big smile on the faces of any old school sci-fi, tech and video game fan.  The back and forth banter between Wendy and The Middle Man is just hilarious and overall, you have to credit the writers for the witty and humorous dialogue.

It's a shame that this series has been canceled.  With the popularity of the comedy sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"", shows like G4's ""Attack of the Show"", ""The Middle Man"" also lended itself to uber-geekiness but because of that, the show was unique in its own way and for those who appreciate such things, it was very cool and fun to watch.

Fans will definitely not be disappointed by this DVD release.  Featuring twelve enjoyable episodes and hours of special features, if you are looking for something different, crazy, campy but all out fun, then definitely check out ""The Middleman - The Complete Series""!",1249430400,2,10645,4.94240542066629
3829320,5,B001XW7ICW,"A lot has been said about this series in the reviews and it's difficult not to repeat what others have stated. I've never reviewed a product on Amazon before, but felt compelled to do so for this DVD set.

The Middleman is a great series. I was not aware of this show when it originally aired and only knew of it through the Amazon recommendations. I had no expectations and planned to watch one or two episodes the first night I received it. I ended up having a Middleman marathon.

This show has a great cast, good storylines and enough tongue-in-cheek humor to make it enjoyable for most viewers. Bottom line: buy it, rent it or mooch it from your friends. This is a MUST SEE series!",1249430400,,686,4.393700787401575
3829321,5,B001XW7ICW,"I watched this series when it came out on cable and loved it. I will buy the DVD set since I didn't get to see all the episodes when they were show and the cable network never ran any reruns of the series. My main complaint is Amazon's constant mislabeling of their DVDs. This series is comming out in widescreen, as it says in the Format listing of the DVD description. The trouble is the Aspect Ratio is listed as 1:33, that is full screen, which would indicate a pan and scan release. Amazon has done this on many of their TV DVD releases. The Aspect Ratio is on a line of its own and is what most people check to see the format of the release. The widescreen listing on the Format line is just one of several entries on that line and not the one most people check. Sometimes the Format line says both widescreen and full screen if both formats are on the DVD, but one would expect the best format, that is the widescreen one, would be listed in the Aspect Ratio line. For some reason Amazon list the Aspect Ratio of almost all their TV DVDs as 1:33, even though most of them are now the widescreen 1:77. Amazon needs to correct this and list the correct Aspect Ratio on their TV DVDs. It would go a long way in resolving the hesitancy of many people in buying the DVD set if they knew it was in widescreen and not pan and scan fullscreen.",1249344000,,1342,4.185328185328185
3829322,4,B001XW7ICW,"Excellent series.  Almost didn't buy it when site stated 4x3 aspect ratio, but it was too good to pass up.  I was very nicely surprised when the first episode showed up as 16x9 (I assume the others will be also).",1249344000,2,212,4.275
3829323,5,B001XW7ICW,"Once again DVD saves a great television show from obscurity. With the number of television shows that seem to always be scheduled against one another, it's easy to miss one of the better ones while watching the old favorite. Such is the case with the ABC-Family show THE MIDDLEMAN. While lasting only one season, it offered far more than many regular shows around. And now the entire series is available on DVD from Shout Factory.

Based on the graphic novels of the same name (for those who don't know what a graphic novel is, think comic book but longer), the show tells the story of Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales), an aspiring artist who takes numerous jobs from a temp agency to help pay the bills. Her latest is as a receptionist for a DNA lab where things go haywire, the result being a monster that bursts out next to her desk.

Rather than run, Wendy takes on the blob of a creature until a mysterious stranger shows up and deals with the gelatinous mass. At the same time he makes sure Wendy doesn't tell anyone he was here. When asked who he is he tells her he's the Middleman (Matt Keesler).

With her current employer down due to reconstruction, Wendy sets out to find a new job. After all the temp agencies seem to be exhausted, she finds one that takes her in. Given a series of unusual tests, she passes and is then let in on the fact that rather than a true temp agency, she has just been accepted to be an assistant to...the Middleman.

Impressed with her response to the initial creature, he sees her potential to be a superhero of sorts next to him in training. At first Wendy doesn't seem all that interested but fate steps in and she accepts. This of course leads to her first adventure and assist of the Middleman.

Subsequent episodes have the duo taking on various creatures and bad buys. The thing is it's not their crime fighting techniques or the apparent nod to super heroics that make this show so much fun. It's the humor that is found there and the combination of efforts used to make it so.

The sets have an almost sixties quality to them and there are a number of nods to the shows of that period. One in particular almost feels like a scene by scene sequence from the old Avengers show... But it's more than just the appearance of things.

The dialogue is snappy, witty and fast paced, which makes you pay close attention to what's being said, something that the ever present reverse button on the remote helps. Its not that you can't catch it all the first time around, its that you find yourself laughing at what they come up with enough that you miss pieces.

While watching this I also felt reminded of another witty show that was canceled after only one season, a partial one at that. POLICE SQUAD ended up becoming the NAKED GUN films. This show has that same irreverent feel to it. It wraps dialogue around a picture that makes you wonder how someone came up with this idea. And the show features so many pop culture references its sometimes hard to keep up.

The performances contained here are classic. Playing an outrageous character is often taken too far where it becomes less tribute and more insult. Actors overplaying turn a witty character and turn them into something the audience hates. Not so here. Keelser offers the perfect combination of naivet and self assured ability that make the character of the Middleman come to life.

Morales does an excellent job as Wendy. Rather than the big, blonde, busty bombshell of a super heroine, she comes off as the cute girl down the street who turns out to be able to handle all situations quite well. Sensitive artist by day, kick butt crime fighter by night. The wordplay between the two makes for some of the best this show has to offer, not just in the writing (which is great) but in the seemingly effortless banter back and forth between the two as well.

Perhaps you missed this one on television. Now is your chance to make up for that. If you're not sure, rent the first disc. My guess is that after watching just that, you'll consider adding this entire series to your collection.",1248739200,2,4085,4.521680216802168
3829324,5,B001XW7ICW,"Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales) is a fresh out of college artist paying her bills by working at temp agencies.  And she's just had a bad day.  An experiment goes wrong in the lab at her current assignment, making a giant monster.  She barely escapes from that, only to have her boyfriend break up with her on camera for a class assignment.

It's then that her roommate Lacey (Brit Morgan) lets her know about the job offer from the Jolly Fats Wehawkins Temp Agency.  But when Wendy arrives, she discovers that this agency is really a cover for a mysterious organization.  The job offer is as an apprentice to The Middleman (Matt Keeslar).  The job?  Fighting aliens and monsters and anything else that pops up and keeping a tight lid on it so that the rest of the population doesn't freak out.

While Wendy really does want to work on her art, she takes the job.  But can she balance a social life and her true calling with saving the world?

I got so hooked on this show last summer it wasn't even funny.  And I am incredibly sad that it never made it past these 12 episodes.  The show was funny and intelligent with plenty of good action.  It never took itself too seriously, which was most of the fun.  But it took us seriously enough that we weren't talked down to.  It spoofed science fiction and superhero genres in general while using those conventions to tell the weekly stories.  And the acting was spot on.  This was one of the most enjoyable hours of television I have watched in a long time.

So, if you are among the many who missed this show when it aired, fix that right now.  This show will have you laughing at the crazy situations and antics in no time flat.",1248739200,5,1675,4.394136807817589
3829325,5,B001XW7ICW,"Ah, The Middleman...a TV show that aired on ABC Family during the Summer of 2008 at a time when the network was still trying to find its signature show. And through all the experimentation, with the lifting of spirits and dashing of hopes, that signature show would be...The Secret Life of the American Teenager!?! Unfortunately, success begets...the executives demanding more of the same, as in, ""Find me our next 'Secret Life!'"" So out goes The Middleman and Kyle XY...and in comes...10 Things I Hate About You and Make It or Break It.

Sure, watching a ""family"" show about the struggles of teenagers is relatable to...other teenagers. I mean, Kyle XY ostensibly was a show about teenagers in high school, albeit with sci-fi elements, until they stopped being in high school (were they on an extended summer break, or was it like Smallville, where everyone was in college...until the characters all of a sudden weren't in school anymore?). Greek continues, but that's because it fits in with ABC Family's ""A New Kind of Family"" mantra, due to the relationships that these college-age kids form with one another. And yet, a show like The Middleman, that presented the struggles of young adults trying to make it on their own in the world, and yes, forming their own kind of family-units (yes, I'm alluding to Wendy and Lacey), doesn't find an audience and has to go into a Middle-Coma until somebody can figure out which end is up.

Sigh! Was I ever in ABC Family's target demographic? Let's just say that I'm in the same cohort as series creator Javier Grillo-Marxuach, being ever so slightly older. Did I really know what I was getting into when I watched the season premiere of The Middleman last year? Heck no! The commercials and the posters at the mall looked cheesy, but it's a cheesiness that I've come to appreciate. The Middleman TV show, as Wendy would say, is something of an unwanted flipper baby. But even unwanted flipper babies need love, and I certainly love The Middleman. Come back soon Em-Em and Dub-Dub, because I certainly don't want to be the one that's responsible for saving the world....",1247356800,,2114,4.820936639118457

3829327,5,B001XW7ICW,"But I am damned well preordering this. I just can't take the chance, that I would miss out on one of the best shows I have ever seen.  I was so sad when they took it off the air, it really upset me.  Maybe once in a decade they put show this fresh and filled with funny well written wit which appeals to both fan-boys and ordinary people.

I would love to just tell you what the show is about, and what genera it is, but it defies genera.  Its a bastard love child of every pop culture in joke you ever told or thought about telling for the last 30 years.

 The best thing I can think to describe it as is this. If you took the old cartoon tick, and had it have a one night stand with Men in black, and that child was raised by a ninja in the fine arts of kung fu and sci fi movies, while wearing a Lucho libre wrestlers mask, you might have something close to this graduate high school ditch his birth right and go to art school.

If you ever watched an old 80's flick and liked it, your going to be sorry if you don't order this.  In fact, order two, and send one on the rounds to your freinds houses, so they can enjoy it too. Trust me they will thank you for it.",1246320000,2,1166,3.890295358649789

Just so much fun, so much wit and so much awesomeness -- I was so sad to see it go; I already have all of the episodes off of iTunes, but still want the DVDs, just because I love the Middleman so gosh-darned much.",1245110400,2,617,4.508928571428571

Why, then was this show cancelled? To make room for the critically acclaimed 'The Secret Life of the American Teenager' of course! God only knows America desperately needs to explore this vast untapped resource of drama never before seen of the American Teenager! ABC Family is now filled with gems such as Secret Life, Greek, Lincoln Heights, and ...premiering in July...!! 10 Things I Hate About You! Another high school drama! Thankfully ABC Family had the courage to explore this untapped resource!

3829331,4,B001XW7ICW,"Fans of the 1960s spy series ""The Avengers"" -- or breezy, witty, feather-light entertainment -- will particularly love ""The Middleman."" Adapted by Javier Grillo-Marxuach from the comic book he co-created with Les McLaine, the series delights in great throwaway lines, wacky concepts, and truckloads of wry pop culture references. Despite a frequently threadbare budget, the show is consistently entertaining, often hilarious, and occasionally surprisingly touching.

Jaded artist-turned-temp Wendy Watson (Natalie Morales) gets her life swiftly upended when she's recruited by The Middleman (Matt Keeslar), an enigmatic yet preposterously wholesome hero, in his fight against evil. Amusingly, a love of hardcore zombie movies, science fiction, and Xbox shoot-em-ups has left Wendy only too well-prepared for her strange new lifestyle. Together, they'll battle villainous luchadores, fish-craving zombies, mafioso gorillas, and other delightfully gonzo menaces.

Morales' snarky cool sometimes comes across as flat and whiny, but Keeslar's a square-jawed hoot, delivering the most cornball lines with mellifluous earnestness. His sweetly old-fashioned not-quite-relationship with Wendy's roommate Lacey (the astoundingly cute Brit Morgan) becomes the show's secret weapon, providing real and surprising poignancy amid an otherwise goofy show. The snappy dialogue flies fast and furious (with surprising detours into genially risque territory) and all the characters are given admirable depth and charm throughout the series' run.

Badly underbudgeted and mismatched to its teen-targeting network, ""The Middleman"" never really stood a chance. On the SciFi Channel, it might have become a perennial; here, at least, you'll get a satisfying story told in 12 clever, entertaining episodes.",1242691200,10,1784,6.128

3829333,5,B001XW7ICW,"When the Middleman prepared on ABC Family or Disney Family witch is what is truly is I saw a good take on the BBC Doctor Who spin off of Torchwood, and I'm looking forward to owning this version.",1240531200,2,195,4.157894736842105
3829334,5,B001XW7ICW,This show is not just for geeks and freaks.  It is good entertainment and a refreshing departure from the reality shows and dramas that have taken over an already mentally limiting media.  The cast has a great chemistry and the conversion from graphic novels to TV is well done.  It reminds me of Get Smart meets Man From Uncle meets Science Fiction Theater but brought into the 21st Century.  I loved it and found it addicting in spite of the late night schedule.,1237852800,7,464,4.554216867469879
3829335,5,B001XW7ICW,"Wow! This show...totally caught me by surprise. Wasn't doing anything the Monday night it premiered so I watched it when it came on...at 9pm[CST] I think it was. Oh yea...watched the rerun at 11 too. Hahah! The show had captured me within the first 10 minutes. The witty banter and hilarous mastermind criminals. Always beginning their declaration of doom to the world with that usual...""My idea was so sophisticated...""(or however it goes). I'm so so sad to see this show leave the air. :(

The characters are hilarous! The interaction between them is classic. From vampiric puppets to flying zombie fish...this show has it all. And believe me...if you give this show a try you'll find something to make you love it.

P.S. Listen out for the Wilhelm scream in every episode. XDXD!",1237766400,9,781,4.864661654135339
3829336,5,B001XW7ICW,"I have seen every episode of the Middleman numerous amounts of times and have been waiting on this DVD set since about the second episode in. Its  a TV show that had a lot of things going against it, primarily its network. Who really watches shows on ABC Family? But despite that the show was a truly funny show whose crisp dialogue ( a phrase that can't be used enough when speaking of this show) sparkled with wit, pop culture, and the best of the geek references in a subtle yet well played way. It's Alias but funny. Its Buffy without the melodrama (BTVS forever though :). Its Chuck without the same people getting kidnapped every week. Its all those shows and more and you will not regret buying it. Typically I'd say netflix it but not this one. You'll want the extra features this dvd set offers and once you finish this show then you'll kick yourself for not having caught it while it was on air. Its that good of a show. This show deserves a family guy type resurrection stat!",1237593600,43,986,4.387978142076503

The Middleman (2008) is a rare jewel. Its part of my one season wonder collection, which includes classics such as The Prisoner (1967-1968), UFO (1970), The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. (1993-1994), Eerie, Indiana (1991-1992), Odyssey 5 (2002), Wonderfalls (2004) and The Middleman (2008). All of these series were wonderful, but they didn't get a chance to end properly. They have beginnings, middles, but no endings. Another one season wonder, Firefly (2002), was followed up by a feature film, Serenity (2005), which provided closure for the cancelled series. This also happened with Farscape (1999-2003). The series was followed up by the movie Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars (2004), which provided closure to the show.

Some series such as Cowboy Bebop (1998) and The Astronauts Wives Club (2015) are mislabeled as TV series when they really are miniseries because they had complete story arcs in mind before they started. In one season they provided a beginning, middle and end. They have more in common with the miniseries in the next paragraph than with the unfinished series in the above paragraph.

Most cancelled series don't have proper endings because they don't get a chance to finish their story arc, or they never had a story arc to begin with. I love good miniseries like Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Lonesome Dove (1989, Pride and Prejudice (1995) and The 10th Kingdom (2000) because they have beginnings, middles and endings, like a good novel.

The only criticism I have for The Middleman is: After Ida (the robot secretary) dies they bring her back with no explanation of how.

Here are a few other series I really enjoyed watching more than once: Band of Brothers (2001), Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Black Sails (2014-2017), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lonesome Dove (1989), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek The Original Series (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish, or the hundreds of other fantasy and science fiction shows Ive watched.

If you like reading try some of my favorite authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520380800,,2677,5.3619047619047615
8347828,5,B001XW7ICW,"I bought this to guest on my friend's podcast, The Good Die Young on Permanent RCRD, expecting it to be mostly a homework assignment. Instead, I fell completely in love with the show. The show itself is great fun, a mashup of everything from Men in Black to Luchadore wrestling to kung-fu movies to super-science of the '50s, etc., etc. And the extras here are jam-packed and totally worth it.",1519948800,,393,4.628571428571429

8347831,5,B001XW7ICW,"A sleeper hit and future cult classic. I only learned of this show by talking to the film buff who orders for a local library. 12 episodes was enough, and unlike Firefly, won't leave you filled with despair because the series was cancelled. Very sweet, family friendly, and full of so many sci-fi and fantasy references you'll refer to a fansite to get them all. Of particular note, an entire episode is a shout out to Bruce Willis' breakout series ""Moonlighting"".",1500595200,,464,4.7407407407407405
