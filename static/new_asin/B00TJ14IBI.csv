7010539,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Quite possibly the most important film of the decade. Too many trans* people have these struggles and there is no one out there to help. But this film is a support group that we see through the journeys of the characters, support that means we are all dealing with life and we are all scared, and we all deserve respect and love. This film will save lives, create understanding and acceptance, and will change the world of many who see it and internalize it's lovely message.",1428883200,4,475,4.534883720930233

7010542,5,B00TJ14IBI,"This was such a sweet and inspiring film. I'm so glad they used  transgender actress (Michelle  Henley) instead of using non transgender actresses as they have in the past. As Ricky, Michelle was a joy to watch, as was (Michael Welch) as Robby her best friend since the age of Six. Welch really put his heart into this role and didn't let anything hold him back. All the actors were great and I was emotionally invested in each of them for different reasons.

This story takes place in a small town where everyone knows Ricky is Trans but most everyone treats her with respect. It's basically a love story with a couple of twists and secrets.

I thought the actress who played Ricky was very brave to do a full frontal nude scene as a preoperative transgender woman, it wasn't gratuitous but needed for the scene to be impactive.

There are a lot of dynamics explored, such as, am I gay if I sleep with a pre op transsexual ? Am I straight if, I, as a pre op transsexual,sleep with a woman ? etc. It seems confusing but it is dealt with in a respectful and graceful manner.

It made me weepy in certain spots but sometimes it was an (oh that's so sweet)  kind of weepy. As a transgender woman, myself, who had the surgery in 2000, I recommend this film whole heartedly.",1428278400,37,1269,4.374468085106383
7010543,5,B00TJ14IBI,"An amazingly sweet, touching film with Michelle Hendley as a lovely trans gal in a small, rural town. Read the real reviews and the synopses. My expectations were low when I went to the screening (March 2015 in Bend, OR), but I left having laughed, winced, and wished I had brought a hankie for a scene or two. While a few scenes were a little hokey, the acting  was superb. I hope Michelle Hendley goes on to a rewarding career in the film world.
Note on R rating: sex scenes are not explicit. one instance of full nudity. some frank talk about having sex.",1426118400,21,557,4.355769230769231

This is why I recommend seeking out the small independent movies.  You will see more true emotion here than in 100 mainstream Romcoms.

7010554,5,B00TJ14IBI,"At first this movie seemed like a low budget, cheesy movie that I would watch half of and turn it off. I was wrong.
The movie does start out cheesy and slow, but it thankfully doesn't stay that way. This isn't just a movie about a transgender, but a story about how a person bigger than her body impacted people in a tiny town, despite her own insecurities.
You don't have to be an LGBT to appreciate this movie. It is heartfelt, and genuine. The actors are believable and you become enveloped in the story as a whole.
Give it a watch, it's worth it!",1483315200,,550,4.247619047619048

7010556,2,B00TJ14IBI,"While Michelle Hendley's performance is impressive and the acting is professional overall, I find the screenplay to be a bit stilted in its early exposition and cliched in its conclusion. It's a typical Hollywood-type boy-finally-gets-laid movie in which Ricky is the ""boy"", saying sex is the answer to personal happiness. By revealing her body Ricky negates her very femininity and Robby all of a sudden wants to have sex with her despite his asserting he is not gay even though she is a boy from the shoulders down? Had Ricky had gender affirmation surgery and Robby could have seen her womanliness in the moonlight, it would have been much more satisfying to me. No doubt, gays and straights who believe transgenderism is only part of a gay spectrum reveled in that ending. Alternatively, if we saw that Ricky had fully transitioned with the crotch still hidden, even without the ""bottom"" surgery yet, and if Robby then saw her as a woman to be loved, it would have been an acceptable compromise for me. I know film students love to allude to previous movies, and this cheaper version of ""The Crying Game"" shows how far we have come as a society--and how far we have yet to go. My own experience is more complex as shown in my play ""Among Amazons"" (at Amazon.com).",1482019200,2,1267,4.711711711711712

I extend my limitless appreciation to the reviewers who gave it raves and convinced me to get it.  I love this movie. No wonder it was such an award winner. Michelle Hendley is gorgeous as Ricki, feminine, a delightful charming ray of light. Her friends are written as friends, not caricatures. Michael Welch as Ricki's close friend Robby masters the flustered, loving, bewildered roller coaster of feelings required in this movie, too fond of Ricki to turn away when things get tough, drawn ever closer to her while trying not to stand in her way. Ricki's conversation with Robby about what's involved in being with a girl is a hoot, craftily written, with just the right mix of awkward tension, nearly flirtatious teasing around the edges as friends discussing sexual intimacy. Alexandra Turshen blows into this movie like a rush of Southern light and charm as Francesca, Ricki's newest friend. Ricki's intimate exploration with Francesca is patient, gentle, sensuous and joyful, centered around mutual discovery rather than conquest. Randall Newsome as the father could have been written as an afterthought, but he's written as a loving, supportive and important character. He reminds me of Paul Dooley's character as Molly Ringwald's father in Sixteen Candles; in contrast to the typical TV and movie father, he ""gets it"", understanding and really listening to his daughter; he ""sees"" her, in the sense used in James Cameron's movie ""Avatar"". Ricki's younger brother Sam (Joseph Ricci) is supportive and fully comfortable with Ricki's transitioning. He's a charmer, no doubt with a posse of girls at his side after his appearance in this film. When Francesca's Marine fiance David Applebee comes home, the tension introduced into the relationship between Ricki, Robbie, Francesca and David looks to take the mood down a dark path, but the transition is written into the movie not simply for cliche third-act dramatic tension, but to recognize that in the real world, transgender boys and girls do not find universal acceptance. I earnestly hoped for a reconciliation between  these characters and was fully satisfied with Schaeffer's ending. That happens when all elements come together well: writing, directing, lighting, set design, music, continuity, acting.  Oh and hey, Michael Galante (David Applebee), when Harry Connick Jr. is ready to sign off on his movie autobiography, I hope you've got some crooner in you. In appearance and manner, clearly you'd be a shoo-in. I'd drop a line to his manager if I were you.",1466640000,3,2729,5.401408450704225

7010576,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Because I am a Transwoman (nothing like outing yourself on one of the world's biggest public film review fora, eh?), I've watched perhaps a half-dozen films on the subject, not including documentaries, and I am happy to say that this film is by far the best. ""Beautiful Boxer"", an excellent Thai production about Muay Thai world champion Parinya Nong Toom, was, until I watched ""Boy Meets Girl"", my #1 pick for well-done Transwoman films. Even though Nong Toom was portrayed by non-Trans real-life Muay Thai champion Asanee Suwan, he did a marvellous job and I recommend it highly. Still, it has now become #2 (of 2!) on my list of truly excellent films on the issue of male-to-female transsexualism.

To illustrate how highly I regard BMG, just let me say that I streamed it yesterday and immediately after, purchased a digital copy of the film. Today, I watched the film twice in back-to-back viewings and was just as powerfully moved on the third viewing as I was on the first. It is simply the best portrayal of a Transwoman and some of the thornier social and emotional issues we face that I've yet seen. Thankfully there was virtually no violence in this film, and while sexual matters were discussed quite frankly among the characters using some pretty salty language, there were no gratuitous sex scenes in the film and only one brief but necessary scene with frontal nudity.

The cast, none of whom I have seen before because I don't watch TV, were outstanding with Michael Welch's and, of course, Michelle Hendley's performances being wonderfully real and compelling, were totally convincing in their portrayals and the film would not have succeeded quite so nicely without them. When I learned that Michelle Hendley is a Transwoman and not another Felicity Huffmanesque example of poor casting, my appreciation for this film only skyrocketed. Not only is she drop-dead gorgeous - I would sacrifice my Kindle HDX 7 by fire to be so beautiful! - she's a great actress and a courageous young woman. Well done indeed, Younger Sister!

All-in-all, this was a great flick with comedic bits, profound bits, romance, laughter and a happy ending, despite the fact that it made me weep more than once. I wish more Trans-related films were as uplifting and honest as this one.",1459987200,12,2276,4.875968992248062

7010581,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Brilliant movie.  Entertaining, realistic, and funny banter between characters.  Conversations happened in the movie that trans people often encounter among friends and family.  Challenged stereotypes and tropes that movies about trans people tend to fall into.  Casting was excellent, particularly that a trans actress was cast to portray a trans character.  Made me cry actual HAPPY tears by the end of the movie (both times I watched it in the single day) simply because the ending is NOT tragic, it is happy and inspiring and exciting, and was something relatable for the kid going off to college and wanting to make a name for theirself.  At the end of the movie, I was just so happy for the characters, and all of the loving support that they had for each other, and the exciting new adventures they were headed off on.",1456876800,,825,4.815602836879433

Yes it still was a bit formulaic, but then again sometimes it's not a bad thing to have a movie take you where you'd like it to.

7010589,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Thank the heavens I did not read a single review before I rented this movie. This movie kept me engaged the entire time, unlike most films of this category do. I got really pulled into Ricky's character - Ricky's raw emotion, ambitions, dreams to 'break-out' of the small city, and get known as a designer, and to be accepted. I fell in love with the character instantly. This cute film made me laugh a few times and believe it or not, cry. What I thought was interesting was Ricky's relationship with Robby. The two had very much quite a strong mix of ""bro"" moments, as well as tender woman-male friendship moments. I loved how this movie focuses primarily on Ricky's strong and positive outlook on life and does not portray Ricky as a victim of the intolerance of some members of that community.

After watching the film, I was surprised to learn that Ricky is a true transgender who the director found, thanks to you tube, as Michelle Hendley (Ricky) was documenting the entire transformation from M to F. Without any acting experience, Michelle jumped on board. I thought Michelle did a remarkable job! There are people in Hollywood with several movies yet I cringe when they come on screen due to an obvious inability to act - not so with Michelle - Michelle is a natural.",1453593600,2,1277,4.6255506607929515

7010593,5,B00TJ14IBI,"This is an excellent movie and a sweet love story.  This is why this movie I loved this movie so much:

-- It was set in a small town in Kentucky, not in New York City, LA, DC, San Francisco, or any other big city that all queer and trans people seem to live in the movies.
-- It was a realistic portrayal of small town life.  Not everyone was a close-minded bigoted redneck.  Instead, just like in real life, some small towns have a way of accepting their own.
-- The main character, a transwomen, lived with her loving family.  She was not portrayed as tragic, pathetic, isolated, unloved, or crazy.  She was portrayed as well-adjusted, integrated, and loved.
-- The character of the transwoman was played by an actor who is a transwoman.
-- The whole movie felt realistic -- not overly dramatic or contrived.
-- It told a sweet sweet love story.

7010609,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Was recommended by friends

Personally, it reminded me of a John Hughes flick, specifically Some Kind of Wonderful. Which is NOT a bad thing. We all need a sweet lil Rom-com sometimes.

I think the cinematography could have used a touch more work, especially in the night shots. Way way too much grain.

The story seemed a bit rushed in parts (and too much reliance on coincidence) and you can tell Miss Hendley is not the most experienced actress in regards to her ""delivery"" of her lines.

But it's basically a John Hughes Movie with a trans main character played by a trans actress.....and boy does that girl have some Presence and Charisma. Which I thought made the impulsive sex with the Ingenue thing feel realistic. Who wouldn't want to be around/have sex with adorable Ricky, even some Magnolia-ized Ingenue.

And Michael Welch did a fantastic job as ""The guy who's in love with his best friend but doesn't know how to say it"". His character was easily the most level headed in the movie. Well, alongside Ricky's Dad and brother who were also good. Ricky's Dad reminded me of the Dad in ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""She's All That"", and the brother reminded me of Keith's sister in ""Some kind of Wonderful""

It did make me happy cry, in general I give it a Thumbs Up.",1442707200,,1268,4.563876651982379
7010610,5,B00TJ14IBI,"I will not be able to say enough good things about Boy Meets Girl...but I will try.

At every opportunity to fall into the typical movie formula for this type of movie, Boy Meets Girl takes the road rarely traveled.  When the movie opens, Ricky and Robby are hanging out at the coffee shop and in comes the snobby girl...but scratch the surface and she isn't actually snobby.  She doesn't even drive a BMW 3 Series.  She drives a Ford Escape!

The elements of Boy Meets Girl are woven today by the video Ricky made when she was much younger.  Throughout the film we see more and more of that video.  While Ricky seems have have gained general acceptance around town, her acceptance problems were much closer to home.  As the story develops, more possibly stereotypical characters and/or actions creep in, but are they stereotypical?  The viewer just has to continue to watch to find out.  When Francesca's boyfriend David is first reveal via Skype, the first reaction is typical macho soldier, but maybe not.

I love that this film fought the stereotypes all the way through.  I love that when the film could have ended, it continued on a little bit farther to included resolution scenes for David and Francesca and Ricky and Robby.

As a pre-op MTF this movie was very inspiring and heart touching.

The acting was great and the actors were phenomenal. 11 out of 10",1439510400,,290,4.666666666666667
7010623,4,B00TJ14IBI,"3.7 stars

There's a lot to like about this story.  I love it that the lead, Ricky (Michelle Hendley), is an actual transgender woman. And what a beauty she is!  Her acting was quite good and the chemistry she shared with the other characters was very believable.  I totally bought her attraction to a woman as well as to a man... and that's pretty damn sexy.

The story follows this lovely and very passable pre-op transgender girl who works in a small town coffee shop and dreams of attending fashion school in New York City.  In the meantime, she's spending a whole lot of time with her best friend Robby (who she's known since childhood), and exploring her sexual identity.  Ricky is in her early 20's and has only experienced sexual intimacy with one man.  She sincerely wonders what it might be like to get involved with a woman... all the stars align and in walks the town debutante, Francesca... sparks fly.  Inevitably, BFF Robby sees something serious going down and admits to himself Ricky might be something more than his little sister.

Aside from all the deliciousness Michelle Hendley brings to the story... I loved all the positivity here.  Ricky already knows she's a woman and is in a stable place with that.  She lives in a very loving home with her father and younger brother.  The town is basically accepting-- or she's so passable they just don't know any better.  Transphobia and other darker issues did not go ignored, but they didn't hog the story with tons of bleak negativity either. No violent sexual assaults here.  There is one full-on nudity scene of Ricky here, but it's not pointless and gratuitous sexual stuff... that scene is more emotional.  Overall, it's a very sweet and positive ride with a feel-good ending.  And I'm all for this very positive vision.

The movie isn't perfect.  In light of all kinds of national awareness and support for transgender folk, I think people just wanna hand this one 5 stars and over-praise.  I get it.  But some of these characters were pretty clich, the script wasn't too original outside of Ricky herself, and there was some overacting.  It also annoyed me to listen to trite commentary about women's vajayjay's smelling like fish and Marines being violent and crazy (Francesca's got a Marine boyfriend who behaves like a turd).

And this is personal preference really, but even though the title gives away the ending and her ""true"" love interest is pretty predictable from the start... I preferred Ricky with a woman.  One thing I didn't expect is that a really huge part of this movie is Ricky's relationship with Francesca.  And they had some awesome chemistry!  I thought Francesca was a fun character and the contrasts in her characterization were amusing and very appealing.  I personally didn't feel satisfied with who everyone connected with in the end. It all seemed a little forced.  But in the case of Ricky and Francesca... well, I'm a lesbian who enjoys lesbian stories... so I'm just a tad biased...

There are no graphic sex scenes here.",1438732800,3,3026,4.787644787644788
7010624,4,B00TJ14IBI,"Friends in San Diego could not stop raving about this film, and I was surprised it came from the same director who made Jeffrey Tambor play gay long before ""Transparent."" I can't rave about this film nearly as much as those who recommended it to me, but it is pretty solid, even touching at times.

Trans MTF Rickie is just another girl in a Kentucky town dreaming of a career in New York as a fashion designer while slinging coffee in a po-dunk diner when worldly Franchesca floats in one day like a pink Laura Ashley angel on the wind. How these two never knew each other prior being so similar in age is just one of the noticeable writing or plot problems throughout this very low-budget indie, but almost all of them become forgotten by the much better acting. Not exactly naturalistic, but very much entertaining, the film's tone means to tell a story about acceptance and love where one expects oppression and narrow-mindedness in a southern setting.

Eric Schaffer ""goes there"" a number of times by not only talking openly about sex, but how one defines themselves or their sexualiy through the genders of those involved in a relationship. There's also full-frontal from the actress playing Rickie, which isn't supposed to be about shocking the viewers, even though it will. Mostly, the film just wants to open up both a dialogue about gender and expand the conversation about it past hate and into a picture of normalcy. There's only one real character holding onto old-school bashing-type behavior, but even he has an arc that will surprise you.

""Boy Meets Girl"" isn't for every indie fan, and isn't for everyone who knows transgender isssues day-to-day. It's totally ""a beginner's guide to,"" but it's a sweet one at least.",1438300800,,1733,4.789297658862877

  Soooo... We have some sexually explicit adult language, a full frontal and a ton of awkward moments. I think all of the language and the adult scenes were necessary to convey the story as a piece of artwork and not as vulgarity. It reminds me of the 68' Romeo & Juliet film with a completely different synopsis. Please try to leave the religion and the politics at the door.
  Like all of the other reviewers, I began to watch this movie with low expectations and I couldn't have been more wrong. The story kicked off right away. The subject matter of the film and the sexually charged conversations between the main actors was absolutely hilarious. I could really identify with Michael Welch's character and how awkward he felt trying to discuss various sexual situations with a transgender woman full of questions. It kinda reminded me of high school. This movie really took me off guard and completely blindsided me and by the time it was over I was breathless.

When the movie started, I was kind of hesitant about the acting - they all seemed so new and I wasn't sure how it would go. It just got better and better until

7010655,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Ricky may just be one of the most refreshing ingenues I've seen in a movie in years. The fact that she's also a transgendered female is quickly accepted. Such is the charm of Michele Hendley's performance as a young and accepted girl in her small Kentucky hometown. Ricky's personality sets her apart. She's got a job as a waitress in a small coffee shop in town. She lives in a loving home with her single father and younger brother. Her best friend, Robby (the excellent actor, Michael Welch), is a randy young man and their banter is easy and comfortable as you would expect from two friends who have had each other's backs since childhood. At first, I was discomfited by all this acceptance. This is not the America I know, particularly in the South. And then Francesca, the town's rich young lady of means appears bringing complications to both Ricky and to herself. Francesca, though engaged to a handsome young man serving his country in Afghanistan, is uncertain about the future she is expected to lead by her ambitious and upwardly mobile parents. She pursues Ricky and their actions bring about startling behaviors from Robby and then, Francesca's fiancee, David.

That's as much of the plot as I'm going to reveal here. BOY MEETS GIRL is full of surprises. Eric Schaeffer, the writer/director of this smartly observed and satisfyingly emotional film, has created characters that don't behave in the contrived ways of classic rom-com films. Ricky's bluster and bluntness cover a hurt heart that longs for acceptance. Robby is that rare male character. Comfortable in his sexuality and yet sensitive to his best friend's emotional roller coaster. For me, Alexandra Turshen's Francesca was a revelation. This seemingly Southern belle, knows her own mind. She's compassionate and drawn to Ricky's sensitivity. While she loves David (excellently played by Michael Galante), she's not completely in sync with the the traditional expectations placed on her. This foursome of young people are struggling with their emotions, and their feelings with each other and the world around them. It's their very youth that makes them so open to life's possibilities before life forces the to settle down and find their way.

Michael Welch has the toughest acting assignment here, which he meets magnificently in a penultimate scene that just blew me away. I went to look up this young actor's profile on IMDB and noticed he has a pretty large body of work, most of which I've not seen or noticed. Keep you eye on this young man. Given the right roles, he could well be headed for bigger things.

It's not lost on me that this film is appearing just as Bruce Jenner is morphing into Caitlyn Jenner. While the only connection is the transgendered status of Michele Hendley and Jenner, It is good to see positive role models and to shed a more sympathetic light on the transgendered community as a whole. I'm grateful and delighted with Eric Schaeffer's beautiful film and I hope it becomes a cult classic that will be viewed for many years to come.",1433376000,,3041,4.8895348837209305

Just wait though, once emotions and the various side plots enter the scene the action and the quality of acting go through the roof- like amazing, riveting, wiping the tears from your eyes as you reach to show your feelings to your partner quality.  The level of connection among the leads becomes so high they are just their amazing selves you feel. Ricki in particular, as her scenes are often interspersed with a very, very intense video from her youth, just propells every scene.  I imagine the actresse's charisma in person must be through the roof- we'll be blessed if she has more opportunities in other movies.  She just brings it.",1433116800,,889,4.566037735849057

7010668,5,B00TJ14IBI,"wasn't exactly what I was expecting or had in mind that it was going to be, but I loved it. Not to different than what probably happens in real life. It was well written directed and acted. Not going to give anything away so you can be surprised as I was. Don't think you will be disappointed.",1432166400,,293,4.157894736842105
7010669,5,B00TJ14IBI,"I went into this movie kinda skeptical that Hollywood would attempt a true realistic depiction of what it's like to be a normal MtF transsexual with ordinary everyday issues in their life.
By the end of this movie I had literally run through the entire gamut of emotions.
I found Michelle Hendley's character an absolute delight to watch and the most authentic role of a  true to life transsexual woman.
Plus, she's absolutely gorgeous!
Watch this movie and tell others to watch it, especially if they are curious about what it's like to be a MtF transsexual.",1432080000,,559,4.762886597938144

7010671,5,B00TJ14IBI,What a beautiful thoughtful and sensitive coming of age film. I usually beat to my own drummer but on this i must drop step and form a line behind the other reviews and give this one a 5 without hesitation. Going to watch it again!,1431734400,,231,4.155555555555556
7010672,5,B00TJ14IBI,Hard for me to watch at times... likely due to my own ignorance.,1431734400,,64,4.0
7010673,5,B00TJ14IBI,Michelle Hendley was incredible in this role as Ricky. Eric Schaeffer the writer and director has just completed his best work ever with this movie. His vision in picking the cast was perfection. A must see over and over again.,1431648000,,227,4.7

7010675,5,B00TJ14IBI,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I thought that it was so well done in that it treated this subject with love and respect. The storyline and the acting both were superb. It was quite interesting and a delight to watch.",1431561600,2,235,4.2444444444444445
7010676,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Wish I could give it more than 5 stars!  I read other reviews that mentioned flaws in acting and cinematography, but I did not see any flaws.
I am also glad they had a transgender in the lead role and not some one who pretended to be transgender.",1430870400,2,246,4.125
7010677,5,B00TJ14IBI,"I really enjoyed this movie, my only complaint is that it was to short.",1430697600,2,71,4.142857142857143
7010678,5,B00TJ14IBI,I was positively surprised by this movie. It is a very hard topic to discuss in our society and I feel this movie really did a good job at presenting it so that it is not offensive to the the right or belittling or demeaning to the left. I enjoyed this movie and was amazed at the actors.,1430697600,2,288,3.9827586206896552
7010679,5,B00TJ14IBI,"This was a great movie, and though I wasn't 100% satisfied with the way the love triangles (or whatever shape) turned out (it's just my own biases), I was still satisfied with the movie overall. Really cute, great performances, really nice to see a movie about us trans women that isn't sad and depressing. Highly recommend!",1430697600,2,324,4.803571428571429
7010680,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Not without flaws, this movie shows the importance of having a trans woman in the role of a trans woman character. Michelle Hendley is delightful, charming, hilarious, gorgeous and shows the depth that is possible with trans characters.

Is it perfect? No. Few movies are. But with the help of his lead, Eric Schaeffer has delivered an authentic feeling movie that gets it right way more than not. Every character feels real. very little of the dialogue feels stock even though these are situations and themes that have been explored before.

Loved it so much. Honestly it made me feel vulnerable and hopeful, and really touched me in a lot of ways.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a good romantic comedy, trans or cis, queer or not.",1430697600,,740,4.765625
7010681,5,B00TJ14IBI,"I love the story, I love the characters, and I wish we had more movies like this. The trailer wasn't very well edited, so I didn't come into it expecting much, but the movie turned out to be very well paced. All of the actors were excellent. I'm definitely recommending this to my friends.",1430352000,,289,4.37037037037037

7010685,5,B00TJ14IBI,Well done movie. Down to earth and gets right to the heart of the matter. Discusses the transgender issue without apprehension. Highly Recommend!,1430006400,,145,5.3478260869565215
7010686,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Few movies move me as much as Boy Meets Girl did, while also making important social commentary and still managing to be thoroughly entertaining and engaging. The movie had me from the start, from the moment I watched the trailer (about a thousand times) until the very end, which had me in tears for almost the last 15 minutes of the whole movie for every range of emotion imaginable.

Michelle Hendley's performance and her chemistry with Michael Welch throughout the movie and throughout the range of their relationship is all the testament you need to Eric Schaeffer's casting credit and his directorial vision. The rest of the cast is extremely solid, following a group of people you love, hate, and everything in between.

Finally, it's a movie about what will undoubtedly come to be remembered as the defining issue of our time. As trans rights go from a quietly suppressed fight to a near cause clbre, and as trans people go from the shadows to the spotlight, movies like Boy Meets Girl will define that era in popular culture. From the point of view of a trans woman myself, BMG was exceptionally well done, and succeeded in being a romantic comedy while never losing sight of its responsibility to carefully manage a transgender narrative.",1430006400,13,1249,4.831775700934579
7010687,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Very charming movie, Ricky is so strong and real with herself and the world around her, she's just like everyone else she's looking for love thinking about her future. This movie has a very charming ending i loved it I recommend this movie highly!",1430006400,,247,4.636363636363637
7010688,5,B00TJ14IBI,"Boy meets girl is a type of movie that you show to your friends and say ""You got to watch this!"".
This is the one of the few independent films which has the potential to be nominated or even win an Academy Award.
The story moves you to tears and joy at the same time.
Michelle Hendley has done the elegant job of portraying a trans woman in the best way possible.
Other lead actors especially Alexandra has given a mind bogging performance.
Micheal Galante has done an awesome job of playing a marine and has represented exactly what a bigot person is like and how they too have shameful secrets.
Eric the director is one of the most broad minded directors in history. No one can pull an amazing show like him. His films tend to focus on inclusive of all different colors of the rainbow not just black and white.
Never miss this movie. There is a lesson in every scene.
Overall a must watch for youth of the world.",1429920000,,914,4.319767441860465

7010691,5,B00TJ14IBI,"EXCELLENT+++++This movie was the most realistic depiction of a transgendered woman played by a very talented transexual woman.  The movie was bold and beautiful and I was transfixed on how elegant Michelle was and the director hit a homerun telling this story.  I don't think people realize how hard it is to want to be the opposite gender.  It's not easy as I have struggled with my own issues centered around something that I should have done a long time ago, but I did not have the guts to deal with it and have stayed in the closet to everyone, but my wife, who accepts me, but she is struggling with me ever being exposed as a cross-dresser, much less, a transsexual.  I admire the way it showed how the family and town accepted her and this would be ideal if it was believable, but she made it like is was the card she was dealt with  and she seemed to be happy.  The love scenes were fantastic and I hope that people see that we are just humans and that our minds and bodies sometimes don't match.  This story, like many other pioneers (Christine Jorgenson, Renee Richards, Tula, and now Bruce Jenner) , might give many others a chance to do what their mind is telling them and the Jazz's of the world, the little boys that become girls, because they feel that is the right thing for their body, God, I wished could get a do-over, I would be a girl and I know my Mother would have never accepted me as in my time years ago, I would not have been accepted because it was considered to be a sin and you would be labeled a nut case.  We are not nuts, thanks for making this movie to show how that we can be everyday people and just want our normal lives free of hate and bullying and stupidity.  Wonderful movie!",1429833600,19,1716,4.271604938271605

7010693,5,B00TJ14IBI,This movie is surprisingly good. Starts out slow for about 15 minutes then it picks up.  The story is so well written and lots of twists and turns.  I watched with 3 friends and we all loved it.,1429660800,2,194,4.078947368421052
7010694,5,B00TJ14IBI,"This movie is amazing! One of the best transgender movies I've seen. It really focuses on the struggles that many trans people face in love, family, and living in society. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. There are few scenes that I would say are not suitable for minors, but that's the parents prerogative. No actual sex scenes, just some PG-13 kissing and talking about arousal and sex. Things covered in sex ed (or should be!) and one full frontal by the gorgeous actress who is Ricki.

Again, I can't stress enough how awesome this movie is and is definitely one to own for anyone who is transgender, does not fit within the binary, or not gender conforming. This was truly amazing!",1429660800,3,695,4.515873015873016

8701934,5,B00TJ14IBI,"This is my favorite Cinderella story.  Michelle Hendley was so inspiring in this film, her willingness to play this part, and do it so openly, she gave me the final nudge to finally come out.  I grew up only a few miles away from where this movie was filmed, and I can't tell you how much I wish I had been able to be Ricky, and have my Robby.  Yes, it may be an overly optimistic portrayal of the life of a transgender woman, but it's needed. Something hopeful, with beauty, that can be a tale of the truth that trans women are women, and we can and do love as women. I wish there were more films like this, that would show us not as victims, but as strong and caring individuals accepted in a positive way within our families and communities.  I cry at the ending every time.",1526774400,2,777,4.16

But I gave it another 10 minutes and I'm glad I did because it seemed to catch its stride about 10 minutes in and then I fell in love with it.  I laughed, and I fantasized a little, and I cried a  little.  A good movie.  I recommend it.
