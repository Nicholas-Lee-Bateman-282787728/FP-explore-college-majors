7361698,4,B013BPR82I,"Although I like this movie a lot and bought it to add to our collection, to my great surprise, it did not have closed captions or SDH (English subtitles)!  I did not know this could happen nowadays, when either CC or SDH are supposed to be provided for people with impaired hearing - which I am not, but being of foreign origin, I find English subtitles most helpful.  Considering how inarticulately the speech in American movies is delivered today, I think even an all-American viewer with perfect hearing would often find it challenging to figure out what is being said on the screen, thus, the subtitles/closed captions are absolutely necessary!  Therefore, this version of ""Duplex"" gets only 4 stars instead of five.",1457308800,,720,4.885245901639344
