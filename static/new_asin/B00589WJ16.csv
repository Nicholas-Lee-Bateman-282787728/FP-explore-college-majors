8461304,3,B00589WJ16,"I love old TV westerns.""Laramie"" is one of the best, particularly Season 2. Nearly all of the westerns I watch are in black & white. I'm OK with that. I don't need them colorised. I don't want them colorised. BUT ...... the 3rd and 4th Seasons of ""Laramie"", produced in color are absolutely crying out for some kind of re-mastering. I bought this set to get some kind of ""color relief"" from the countless classic b&w shows I've been viewing. The shame is, these color episodes look like they've been transferred from old VHS tapes. That said, I will still watch them as they are the only legitimate ones available. It may never happen, but hope springs eternal.",1489708800,2,661,4.610169491525424

8461307,4,B00589WJ16,"This TV western had gone from black-and-white to color and these are the first ten episodes of the final two seasons. This two dvd set is fine and sufficient if you
do not care to buy the complete third and fourth seasons. Spring Byington from Decermber Bride fame is brought in to take Hoagy Carmichael's place although two years later and Dennis Holmes plays an orphan boy adopted by Slim and Jess much to replace the void left by the departed Robert Crawford Jr. as Slim's brother Andy.
These ten episodes are watchable as the series slowly took a downward turn. Robert Fuller overshadowed John Smith in popularity by now.",1333497600,4,625,4.6909090909090905
