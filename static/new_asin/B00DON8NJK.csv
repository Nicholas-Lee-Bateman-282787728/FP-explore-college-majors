5838764,5,B00DON8NJK,"I like so much the idea to present at one disc three of the best movies of selected actors. And this is on of them. Quality, shipment, content, packing - you name the superb purchase for the amount you chose to spent. I believe people that Michael Duglas as an actor will also like this trio which I highly recommend. Enjoy your marathon.",1391385600,2,338,4.380952380952381
5838765,3,B00DON8NJK,"3-disc set (2013) includes: Fatal Attraction, Disclosure and A Perfect Murder. There is roughly 82 minutes of bonus content along with an audio commentary for Fatal Attraction and 2 audio commentaries with a 5-minute alternate ending for A Perfect Murder that has been ported over from DVD releases. Disclosure does not get supplements. Overall, the picture and audio quality are all good (they aren't perfect but there are no major problems). English, French, and Spanish audio formats and subtitles are available (at a minimum).

Fatal Attraction is about Douglas getting trapped in an affair with a psycho who wants to have his baby.
Disclosure is about Douglas getting sexually harassed by his female boss while the company tries to cover it up.
A Perfect Murder is about Douglas plotting to kill his wife after finding out about her affair.

This could almost be called the ""Michael Douglas Affair Collection"". All the films are worth watching. Fatal Attraction made a huge impact with audiences when it was released and is the best of this lot. Disclosure reversed traditional gender roles and provides some great moments. A Perfect Murder has now been added to the Fatal Attraction/Disclosure 2-pack (sold separately) and works as a throw-in for this set. These are three good films starring Michael Douglas (also see Wall Street, Basic Instinct and The Game). My only real complaints are that this triple feature is very light on bonus content and there is nothing superb about it but that isn't news because it's priced as a value pack anyway. These are 4 star films in a 3 star package.",1377302400,5,1596,4.97378277153558

8595443,5,B00DON8NJK,"I started out wanting to pick up Fatal Attraction, then I found a double feature with Fatal Attraction and Disclosure. While I was looking for the best price, I found this triple feature. A great set of films for the Michael Douglas fan. At the time of purchase it cost $15.99, so you can't go wrong for $5.33 per film. Highly recommended!",1494979200,,339,4.483870967741935
