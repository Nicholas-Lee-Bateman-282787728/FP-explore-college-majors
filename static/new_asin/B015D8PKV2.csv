8733227,2,B015D8PKV2,"Eva (Jessica Morris) is in prison and wants to go straight. She is bullied and abused. Her daughter while visiting her gives her some tiny worry dolls. These dolls enter her head through her ear and takes control over her while manifesting themselves as a big zit in the middle of her forehead which on occasion opens up to reveal a tiny miniature bloody skull.

The acting is fairly bad. The prison scenario is cliche. The horror aspect was more of a joke. Not bad enough to be in the Ed Wood category, and not good enough to pass as worthwhile entertainment. This is part of a 20 Horror DVD set available at Wal Mart for $5.00. Might be worth a free Prime watch if you are desperate for bad entertainment and stoned.

8733230,3,B015D8PKV2,This movie gets 3 stars only because it is DANGEROUS WORRY DOLLS! re-released under a different name in order to get people to buy the same movie twice. A trick that Charles Band loves to pull on his fans way too often. The movie itself is a good flick if you're a Full Moon Features fan or into B movies. If not you might not like this movie.,1467244800,,343,4.0588235294117645
