8468196,5,B000T8FB0C,"2324 is an extremely interesting film. The idea of using 3D in a documentary like this is a little mind blowing.

Not just the obvious 3D effects (guitar necks sticking out of the screen,etc) but more subtle ones, like the really claustrophobic feeling a tiny hallway used as an isolation booth for a solo, or the closeness you feel with all the friends working together for a common end. I felt a viceral sense of being there, which 3D films always promise, but rarely deliver.

I loved the tactile sense of close up 3D guitar chord fingering. I suspect it would not be the same film in 2D. My favorite 3D has Mike Alverez, caged in a virtual 3D cube, agonizing over lyrics for a song about the legendary guiatist Les Paul. The music, while not personally my favorite part, was nonetheless showcased in an very compelling way. It was fascinating to see how the music progressed, from songwriting to finished product.

Best song, ""Tell Me"".",1257811200,2,940,4.650602409638554
