2679801,3,B000JVSV8I,"While the singing is excellent and this operetta is loaded with marvelous tunes, I found the lack of period costumes jarring. I had last seen this production in a little jewel of a theater in Salzburg, and what a difference!

Nonetheless, I would recommend this DVD until something more authenic comes along. Sound and video are both excellent.",1181174400,,344,4.931034482758621
2679802,5,B000JVSV8I,The story is a little bit silly and some of the comedy can fall flat. But the music is wonderful and the cast sings it this way. They also are excellent actors who can really make one believe in love. It helps that I understand German.,1174435200,,235,4.130434782608695
2679803,4,B000JVSV8I,"Der Graf von Luxemburg is a particularly strong Lehar score with memorable melodies piled on one another.  Here the operetta is performed live before a highly appreciative audience.  The singing, the conducting, and the sound are very good as is the acting.  There are only two problems: the story is quite silly and there are no characters with whom one identifies with - as there are in the Merry Widow.  Is this the fault of the director or of the original libretto?  I do not know.  But the music is great and makes a fine listen.",1168214400,,534,4.510416666666667
2679804,3,B000JVSV8I,"Enjoyable operetta and strong cast fortunately are not completely ruined by clueless director (who also ""edited"" pretty good original script so it lost any logic in its development).",1166313600,,182,5.535714285714286
2679805,5,B000JVSV8I,The Count of Luxemburg can stand on its own as an enjoyable operetta. This particular DVD is delightful and proves that Lehar demands singers with exceptional talent and artistry. This outstanding cast deserves your attention. You won't be disappointed.,1163030400,,253,5.512820512820513
8153418,5,B000JVSV8I,This is an excellent recording of a beautifully performed late Lehar Operetta.  The sets are great.  The costumes are awesome.  To watch Harald Serafin (the then artistic director of the Morisch Festival) perform is a delight.  The sound is excellent.  The video quality is also excellent.  As noted by another reviewer the plot is complex and the ending sort of chinchy.  There are lots of reprises.  The melody and dancing dominate.  The plot seems at times to be a way of getting from song to song.,1469491200,,501,4.732558139534884
8153419,5,B000JVSV8I,"Franz Lehar composed this work in 1909, later revising it in the 1930s. It's plot involves a poor aristocrat who enters into a fake marriage with an opera singer (they never actually see each other!) to elevate her social status (after a quick divorce!!)so that she, in turn, can marry an aged Russian prince. Of course, in true operetta style, the aristocratic Rene and the opera singer Angele later meet in person and fall n love, not realizing that they are married.

Sound confusing?

Welcome to the wacky world of operetta!

This is a splendid performance of a hugely melodic score, with oodles of romantic melodies, fine singing and wild dance numbers. To me, the Seefestspiele Morbisch is the Grand Prix of operetta. It was is some reviews of their DVDs in Opera News that I first became aware of them, and was able to confirm what was written of them, namely that they are, without reservation, some of the best performances of operetta available on disc.

The stage in this outdoor venue is huge and allows for a lot of spirited dance numbers. The singers in this performance all develop their respective characters both musically and dramatically, although critical objectivity requires me to note that none would fare well on the operatic stage. The ladies' voices, although perfectly suited to operetta, lack the weight and depth for opera, and the same can be said of the men. Michael Suttner as the Count has ample range for his role, but one looks in vain for the ""ping"" of a Fritz Wunderlich, and Gesa Hoppe, as his love interest Angele is more soubrette than lyric soprano

And yet, gentle reader, the overall effect of this performance is to want to see it again, which says a lot for the totality of this version of the operetta. And my five star rating reflects, I trust, when combined with the text of the review, some sense of my delight in experiencing it.

Although, some performances of the Morbisch series date back to the mid 1990s, with attendant issues of picture and sound, all are quite successfully realized, and this one, from 2006 has no technical issues, other than those imposed on the reproduction process by an outdoor venue.

Some Amazon sellers have this, and its kinder, at quite nice prices, for the value conscious.

8153423,3,B000JVSV8I,"The DVD disc and its case arrived in very good condition sooner than time expected. The video recording is very good, but the audio at the beginning sounds a bit far (low) for the Count Danilo when his first appearance.
I very much liked the voice of the soprano Juliane Banse, with very easy and powerful acutes, besides of her beautiful sound of voice. Also the comic tenor and soprano have a nice voice. The baritone Bo Skovhus sings well enough for this opereta, he has a good voice indeed, but perhaps he could sing a bit more 'legato' instead of 'speaking' in the first duets with the soprano Banse. Comparing with other versions of this opereta I could say that this is a good version and its worth
the price.",1321315200,,716,4.473282442748092
8153424,1,B000JVSV8I,"There is nothing good to say about this production....the acting is poor; the audio is bad; the singing is spotty, not helped by the lousy sound.",1270857600,,145,4.615384615384615
8153425,2,B000JVSV8I,"For your own sanity, dear reader, please do not support this edition of one of the greatest operettas! I was so glad I could get it on a DVD! I was sure it would be great - the Vienna Opera - the Viennese should know how to put up a good production... And then, Amazon recommended ""Better Together"" with Kalman - Die Csardasfurstin DVD ~ Anna Moffo today!  (The Anna Moffo Csardasfurstin is quite magnificent!). So I eagerly awaited its arrival, and played it instantly. What a disappointment... Nothing can destroy the great melodies of Lehr - but even the libretto text was vandalized! The customes, the scenery - just showed how a ""modern"" director wanting to be cute can destroy one of the most fun musicals of all time (since that's what an operetta is - a musical - it is not an opera). This is unforgiveable. The director should choose some other profession. He is not avant-garde, he is not inventive - he just tried to be popular, or 'cool' (=cute). Not on our money, please!",1200268800,,984,4.52808988764045
8153426,4,B000JVSV8I,"Enjoyably campy, an updated version of Lehar's operetta.  Music is excellent, staging on circular stage is amusing, the last act getting its inspiration from Marx Bros.  Excellent singing overall, especially by the minor characters. Bo Skovhus struggling a bit.  Good for a smile and some laughs.",1185926400,,296,5.391304347826087
8153427,4,B000JVSV8I,"Luxemburg is an operetta that is under performed and under recorded. Being an operetta nut (like me) I am very happy to get this disc.
The Plot for this production had been changed from the early 1900 Paris to Vienna in the 50s. Some names of the peripheral characters and/or their occupations were changed. Most notably, Armand Brissard now is Manfred Prskawetz, a student. Furst Basil Basilowitch now becomes a Russian diplomat; his new name is Konsul Dr. Basil Basilowitch-Kolosov. A hyphenated name was added to go with his marriage to Anastasia Iwanowa Kokozowa (who went by the name of Grafin Stasa Kokozow in the original version). It seems that Lehr's score was being kept intact despite some spoken dialog had been altered to match the theme of the new plot.
The presentation of this production was very well put together; the result was very entertaining. The staging and the way of changing scenes were cleverly done, except the last scene that I felt it was a little sloppy. The principals and the supporting cast did a very good job, both in acting and singing. Through their duets Bo Skovhus (Rene) and Juliane Beans (Angele) really presented themselves as a pair of victimized lovers (and deeply in love). The playfulness of the young pair (Gabriela Bone and Rainer Trost as Julie and Manfred) surely brightens up the whole show. Andreas Conrad and Eva Maria Marold (as the Russian couple) also acted and sang splendidly.
While some reviewers pleased the sound quality of this DVD I found it problematic at times. It is particularly bothersome in the opening scene, and in its repetitions afterward. The chorus sounds muddy. Sometimes Bo Skovhus' voice was too loud and then became not quite audible. It could be due to the positioning of the microphones. It sounds like he was facing the mike and turned away from it. It also happened to Juliane Beans (just not as bad). Perhaps the main source of the problem comes from transposition of the (tenor) key, to that for the baritone. Bo Skovhus is not a stranger to me in operetta. He did a pretty good job in San Francisco's Widow, six years ago. A DVD is available for that production. On CD, he was Count Danilo in the 1995 Deutsche Grammophon Widow, in which Rainer Trost was Camille. I am not able to comment on this CD because I have not yet listened to it.
Rene, in the original score, was a tenor. The sound (or should I say the feel for the sound) is quite different when I compared the music of this DVD to an EMI LP (with Nicolai Gedda as Rene, currently available on CD). For comparison, I watch the DVD on the TV screen and listen to its music through an audio system (the same system I use for the LP or CD). The LP (with a tenor) sounds much better.
In recordings, and also on stage, the role of Count Danilo (its original key was for a tenor) is often played by a baritone. The results have been (more than) satisfying. However, as for Rene the substitution turned out to be less than perfect.
A few words to whose complaining the plot, I think the stories for all operettas and operas are silly to some degree; I just enjoy the music.",1185062400,,3114,4.582437275985663
