1781654,5,B00006JMQB,"Would normally give this one 4 stars, but given what they accomplished on a low budget with unknown actors, it really deserves five stars.
Excellent acting, with believable faces-- real scars, for one thing, and gritty, real personas. Some characters, to me, appeared to be played by people demonstrating their real life roles, so natural they seemed on camera. Virgil's best friend did seem a little stiff at times-- not sure he's really an actor-- but what a great face and demeanor, perfect for the part.

The predictability of the story, I think, is the point. Just as we see in ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""Slingblade"", the story methodically comes round to the inevitable conclusion. Ex-cons like Virgil, especially violent crime and drug offenders, wear an invisible Scarlet Letter on and within their persons. They're branded down to the psychic level, and a 'fresh start' practically requires reincarnation, or at least an entirely new set of circumstances, and they tend to lack the resources and/or know-how to make that happen-- not to mention, people around them aren't exactly eager to lend a hand. Then, ""So what?"" I would say to reviewers complaining about lack of surprises or twists in the story. I've known a couple Virgils, and this is how it plays out. This is their life.

Good stuff.",1416441600,4,1303,4.918181818181818
1781655,1,B00006JMQB,Low budget is not excuse for this predictable and boring movie.  SPOILER: soon as Virgil hooked up with a hooker it was obvious he was going down.,1416441600,,146,4.407407407407407
1781656,4,B00006JMQB,"I like this movie because of the believable cast, great acting. While the ending seems a little dark, that the casts go back to their beginning, there is that possibility that it may not. Just like real life.",1415491200,2,208,4.5
1781657,2,B00006JMQB,"Well this movie was made for a different type of movie goer than I.  I don't mind and didn't expect a high budget film, I wasn't disappointed. The film seemed more like a high school project film than a low budget drama. I am sure there are folks who enjoyed this movie for varying reasons I just wasn't one of them. It does have that quality of you don't want to quit watching it because it must get better but for me it never got better.  Perhaps its an acquired taste.",1414540800,,471,4.164835164835165
1781658,4,B00006JMQB,"For a low budget film it packs an over the top story.  Gritty, real, life that is lived everyday and very well laid out.  Sure the story was good, if somewhat predictable and dark, but the acting really was top notch.  Again, with a low budget film I have come to expect at least some poor acting from at least one person, but from end to end these people delivered solid performances.  I really did believe that they were who they said they were.  In fact, I think of the people, in the jail and the half-way house were acting at their own jobs--if I am wrong than that just makes them that much better.  It is too bad there was no happy ending, but life does not always work that way and sometimes it just needs to be shoved in your face.",1414108800,,740,4.13986013986014
1781659,3,B00006JMQB,Good acting but low budget,1413849600,,26,4.4
1781660,5,B00006JMQB,"No one is redeemed in this film. No one rises above their circumstances to shine. It's basically a study in how low you can go. A bit depressing all around. Nevertheless, this film is worth seeing because the acting is so stellar. It's a bit scary, how well the principal three actors are able to play low lifes so convincingly. Really quite something to see.",1352851200,3,359,4.538461538461538
1781661,5,B00006JMQB,"Virgil Bliss is a likable character.  From the beginning you like his manners and earnest demeanor.  You realize he's going up against a serious challenge in trying to find love in a street hooker named Ruby.  And in overcoming his own disadvantageous position as a recent ex-con.  Not helping the situation any is Manny, his room-mate from the halfway house which he occupies a couple of weeks before moving in with Ruby.

For acting, the movie works quite well in proving high budget production isn't all there is to good storytelling through cinema.  I hesitate to say low-budget because of the connotations that come with the word.  Let's just say that it often looks like a hand-held cam-corder was what they were filming with.  It may have been.  However, due to the nature of the story and location, it doesn't detract too much from the overall visual experience (in some ways, it adds a level of realism that is already there in the actors performances - and they are strong performances).  Grainy and faded color picture are also sometimes a result.  Still, I would have liked the volume level on my dvd to have been a little better.  I had my set all the way up in order to hear it at a comfortable level (and I don't think I'm hard of hearing).  Interviews with the director, which are included on the dvd, didn't seem to be as volume challenged as the movie.  Don't worry, turned up high, you'll hear it just fine, though there are no subtitles.

Obviously for mature audiences, this movie has a lot of soul - a search for something sustaining and true amidst the corruption of existence.",1203811200,10,1600,4.624113475177305
1781662,4,B00006JMQB,"What an incredible film!  I loved Virgil from the opening right up to the violent moment of his undoing.  What a powerful film.  This is one of those movies you want to share with all the intelligent, thoughtful people you know.  Virgil is a real person and we want him to have the life he so desperately searches for once he's been released from prison.  Yet fate, or circumstance, or just dumb luck haunt him in the forms of Manny, the first ""friend"" Virgil makes on the outside, the halfway house ""counselor"" who is mostly concerned with showing his macho stuff, a society demanding that Virgil make it on his own but then won't allow him the most basic snese of self-determination, and an overall system programmed not to care.  Virgil could have made it, and that is the tragedy of his story. Incredible performances all around but especially Clint Jordan as Virgil.  If you crave excellent films that demand your full attention but then require you to come up with the answers, Virgil Bliss is for you.",1171411200,8,1008,4.629213483146067
1781663,5,B00006JMQB,"""Virgil Bliss"" is one of those rare movies that come along once in a long while--the kind of picture that doesn't yield all the answers in just one viewing, the sort of pic you have to watch more than once.  What makes the movie worth watching repeatedly are the incredible performances by Clint Jordan and the cast, some of whom are non-actors with great faces and honest, true-life delivery.  A must-see for anybody interested in real stories about real people and not that [stuff] being shoveled out by Hollywood.  An antidote to ""Harry Potter"".",1038873600,17,548,4.808510638297872
1781664,3,B00006JMQB,"I guess the point this film is making is that its very hard for an ex con to make it on the outside. The acting is actually pretty good but the storyline lacks energy and purpose. I do give this credit for feeling authentic but it doesn't really go anywhere. It does keep you guessing if this will have a happy ending or not. This looks like it was shot on a low quality camera, there isn't much color and everything looks washed out.",1439596800,,434,4.178571428571429
1781665,5,B00006JMQB,Clint Jordan's performance is extraordinary as are those of the rest of the cast. The raw environment setting only adds to the desperate struggles of all the characters.

1781667,4,B00006JMQB,"Turning point is when Virgil takes a leadership role as the robbery goes down and later when he faces off the pimp. The guy is made for that life, not the straight world.
