I paid to view beautiful, relaxing scenery - NOT to view an ad for the makers of the video.  It mars the view of the scenery and is very distracting.  The production itself would have probably merited 3 stars - it is okay, but not as exceptional as I had expected.  I regret having purchased this video.",1297900800,2,447,4.828947368421052
8165083,5,B000LXGVY0,"I am an avid collector of nature dvds.  I love them as background while I complete tedious chores around the house.  This series brings something different into the genre.  Each disc is a destination, not just a theme.

The Bali disc is exotic in its local, and the soundtrack is exquisite.  I like the option of turning on nature sounds and off the music to change things up, but this music is so well interwoven with the video, it is entrancing.

I recommend this series to any nature enthusiast, and I encourage all office bound working folk like myself to add something like this to your viewing collection to provide an escape to a tranquil locale at any time.

These titles are shot in HD, and I can only imagine how much more spectacular the picture is on an HD set since I do not yet have one.

More titles are due to be produced in this series, and I will be first in line to get them.",1203206400,4,894,4.279761904761905
