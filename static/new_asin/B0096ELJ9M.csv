8536627,5,B0096ELJ9M,"Essential viewing for Cohen fans. Takes you into the dark trip of fame, and shows you how ragged someone can get when the world foists its definitions onto you. Climactic Jerusalem show is stunning. Can't believe it's not already being hailed as a classic.",1455753600,,256,4.840909090909091

8536629,4,B0096ELJ9M,"It's a real classic giving a window into that tortured time period in Leonard's life. The performances are almost ecstatic and yet he continually puts himself down. Mesmerizing to watch. The drugs had a lot to do with the dysfunction I think. I love Chelsea Hotel #1 in Jerusalem, but there is an even better version on the internet in Tel Aviv, my favorite version of that song. In any case, a must own for Leonard lovers.",1405036800,2,423,4.5064935064935066
8536630,5,B0096ELJ9M,"Amazing performances & revelatory behind-the-scenes portraying a deeply humble, soulful and supremely talented Leonard Cohen at the height of his powers. Symbiotic relationships with vocalists, band, and irreplaceable Bob Johnston vividly portrayed.",1392595200,2,249,6.8125
8536631,4,B0096ELJ9M,"This is a great & at times very disturbing film. According to the ""I'm Your Man"" book, Leonard often mixed Mandrax & acid during this tour, & you see him eating some blotter acid before the infamous Jerusalem show. Even the Grateful Dead, a psychedelic band, didn't think LSD helped their performances. Leonard's music is poetic & cerebral, but definitely not psychedelic. The drug seems to make him think too much, so that even after giving great performances of ""Chelsea Hotel"" & ""Famous Blue Raincoat"", he tells the audience he isn't delivering, then leaves the stage. His band seem mystified.

Even as a long-time fan of LC, there were parts of this that were hard for me to watch, as Leonard disappoints rapt, fanatical audiences by insisting that he is being mediocre.

In some ways ""Bird On A Wire"" is the Cohen version of Dylan's ""Don't Look Back"". Except Dylan was fueled by his staggering talent, self-belief & arrogance, while Cohen stumbles from one strange show to another with uncertainty. Like ""Don't Look Back"" the film-maker rarely shows a song in its entirety. You need to rent ""Leonard at Isle of Wight"" for that. There are some excellent impromptu improvisations as Leonard makes up 30 second songs in front of the audience to express his self-doubts.

After the film was completed, Leonard screened it & would not allow it to be shown for over 30 years. Yes, that's how personal & sometimes unflattering this look into a highly-complex genius who is not comfortable with himself or the adulation of his supremely-devoted audience is. He almost seems happier when the sound system fails, or military security end his performance prematurely. From the filmed songs, we can now see that LC is indeed ""delivering the goods"", but in his drug-fueled paranoia, he doesn't believe it. A fascinating, sometimes irritating & challenging documentary.",1381536000,21,1860,4.993548387096774
8536632,5,B0096ELJ9M,"This is a great vehicle to showcase the remarkable talent of Leonard Cohen.
Previously unavailable, I was delighted to see it listed on Amazon.
I highly recommend this DVD to all Leonard Cohen fans.",1380758400,3,198,4.852941176470588
8536633,5,B0096ELJ9M,"This is an excellent DVD. I've watched it several times. It is my favorite DVD so far. The addition of the booklet and the poster and smaller picture that were included was a great surprise. I've turned my computer room into my ""Leonard Cohen"" room. I'm looking for good pictures of him in his early years, 30s and 40s. He was a hunk. He's still great at 78, but to look at, his early years can't be beat.",1371081600,5,405,4.205128205128205
8536634,4,B0096ELJ9M,"Everything about Leonard Cohen in this DVD is wonderful. However also included are some very disturbing video clips from the Vietnam War - which I had seen many years ago, but may stay with you stronger than the music. So if you have a young child I don't recommend watching it with them. Or if you can reformat the DVD so that you can edit out that portion - that's an option. I understand this is just my own personal reaction. I love Leonard Cohen - and everyone understands war is horrible - but when sitting down to enjoy a concert tour DVD, I felt that including this footage was totally unnecessary. There could have lots of other images to represent the Vietnam War era.",1367366400,10,678,4.432
8536635,5,B0096ELJ9M,"In October 2012, I saw Leonard Cohen give an amazing, 3 hours non-stop concert in Seattle. One of the two best performances I have ever attended (the other was by Elton John in New York in 1981).
Before going to the concert I searched Amazon and found this DVD, which documents the tour that Lenard Cohen and his band took in 1972. Leonard Cohen had not agreed to release this DVD until a couple of years ago.
It includes a performance in Jerusalem, when Leonard Cohen became so emotional, he could not continue to perform. I attended this concert, yes, 40 years ago, and witnessed first-hand the effects that a visit to Jerusalem often has on spiritual people. I have never forgotten that concert - watching Leonard Cohen and some members of his band cry on stage. So, for me, this is an interesting and very special DVD.",1354492800,17,822,4.5608108108108105
