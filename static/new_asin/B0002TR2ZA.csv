2119593,5,B0002TR2ZA,"I found this video really well done. And also I think it is a good way to teach to our children some important truth about God, having fun. My little boy is just 17 months old and probably  he doesn't understand too much about the movie at the moment, but I have to say that he has a lot of fun looking at the nice characters and listening to the nice songs. I really enjoy it as well.",1179014400,,385,3.9358974358974357
2119594,4,B0002TR2ZA,"The Hermie & Friends series is a fun learning and growing tool for Christian parents.  In this episode, kids meet Webster, a bright young spider who gives kids a plethora of vocabulary lessons.  Wordsmiths will certainly appreciate the dictionary humor.

Because this is a Christian video, some may object to the use of a brief reference that the garden will ""look haunted"" by Webster's webs when the garden bugs are discussing their fears of having a ""scary spider"" in their home.  Also, as noted by another reviewer there is a reference to some colorful language (a**) by the Actor Tim Conway in the ""extras"" which is inappropriate for intended young audience of these videos.  My son (age 4) likes to see the faces behind his favortie characters so it is a little disappointing.",1172188800,,781,4.842105263157895
2119595,5,B0002TR2ZA,"This is yet another winner in the Hermie & Friends series.  My two year old is especially afraid of the dark and this lesson about praying to God when you're scared really helped him understand that he can take his fears to God.  I appreciate a DVD lesson that kids will remember and one that stimulates a follow up discussion, even in young children like my son.

Thank you Hermie and friends, you make the lessons of life fun for kids of all ages!",1102032000,6,449,4.321428571428571
2119596,5,B0002TR2ZA,Thank you for a terrific kids movie. It teaches children not to pre-judge and also how to face fears. It has made a huge impact on our family.,1101945600,4,142,4.107142857142857
2119597,5,B0002TR2ZA,The Hermie series consistently offers light hearted fun and a solid message.  Webster is one of the funniest characters they have created.  The voices and script are top notch and it's wonderful entertainment for the entire family.  My kids keep asking to pray like Hermie does to God.  That's the real testament to the video.  That it impacts the children more when it's off then when it's on.  Keep cranking out quality!,1096934400,8,422,4.791666666666667
2119598,5,B0002TR2ZA,"I was overwhelmingly surprised by this video. It was positive, funny, gently spiritual and refreshing. I can't say enough about how great this video is and how much my god-son loved it.",1095292800,2,185,4.8125
2119599,1,B0002TR2ZA,"You wouldn't expect to hear profanity on a video that is meant for small children, right?  You also wouldn't expect to hear it on a video that is being marketed as having a Christian theme, right?

Well, get ready for some disappointing news.  This video contains something quite inappropriate for the audience in which it was intended.  In one section of the dvd, the voice talent actors are being interviewed.  Since the theme of the video is fear, the actors are being asked about what different words ending in ""phobia"" mean.  (Ex. ""aquaphobia"" is the fear of water, etc.)  The actors sometimes really try to answer the question, and other times they just give what are meant to be 'funny' answers.  The word ""astraphobia"" (the fear of lightning) is given.  Tim Conway says, ""It is the fear of being kicked in your @$$.""  The final word, @$$, is bleeped, but you can see him say it and since the word is ""astraphobia"", it is very clear -even to children- what he has just said.

I expect to hear rough language in a regular movie.  I'm not offended by that.  I do not appreciate, however, when I'm watching a children's Christian video with my kids and suddenly there is an unexpected vulgarity in the video!

If you don't mind your children hearing coarse language in their Christian children's videos, then by all means pick up this video.  If, however, you find this as inappropriate as I do, find some other video for them to watch.",1093910400,34,1440,4.6141732283464565
