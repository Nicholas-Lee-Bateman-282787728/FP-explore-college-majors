6444336,5,B00KQVSD3Y,"...been a long time since I watched a horror film here at home but what better week than that of Halloween? Here's my take on:""Worm""...a creepy sci-fi horror flick. This one is not only in-your-face, it is literally in-your-ear. And I'll leave it at that. It's a modern day rendition of the 50s classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". Only this one will blow your mind...literally. Great fun. It even has a meaningful romantic love theme...between people (if you want to call them that)...and dogs. If you're a fan of this kind of stuff, be sure not to miss ""Worm"". It won several awards upon its festival release. HAPPY HALLOWORM!",1414368000,3,633,4.763636363636364
6444337,5,B00KQVSD3Y,Great twist on bug in the ear... they want it blindly for the ability to dream... what a concept!,1410393600,2,97,4.157894736842105
6444338,5,B00KQVSD3Y,"Every once in a while we stumble upon an independent film that not only captures our attention but inspires us to dig a little deeper as individuals.  After seeing this at the Dark Carnival Film Festival, I instantly wanted to watch it all over again.  It was easily the most unique film that screened that weekend and I would have bought a copy instantly after watching it the first time; almost exclusively because of how well done it was.  I found the characters in Worm to be quite authentic and I always admire when a film creates ""it's own little world."" Worm is best described as a bizarro sci-fi romance (I know, weird right?).  If I had to compare it to three other films, I would have to say - Requiem for a Dream, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and The Stuff first come to mind.  I believe this movie to be underlined with a little social commentary and although is very different from those three films; I can definitely compare it to them with the way they make me think.  If you have lost faith in Hollywood, get this and have faith in indie films!",1404345600,14,1070,4.406091370558376
6444339,5,B00KQVSD3Y,Saw this film at the Nashville Film festival.  Top notch indie production!  The story is imaginative and dark with splashes of tongue in cheek humor.,1404345600,7,149,4.92
8660870,5,B00KQVSD3Y,I honestly don't watch many indie movies but one of my friends told me about this one and I'm glad they did. A review on Amazon can't do this movie justice and I won't even try to put it into words. Do yourself a favor and spend the 2.99 to rent this and experience excellent directing and a story line that will keep you captivated for the entire movie.,1485561600,,354,4.144927536231884

8660873,5,B00KQVSD3Y,"Independent film making at its finest. I did not know what to expect going into this movie, but it honestly blew me away. Everything from the direction to the soundtrack is on point. This film is perfect for anyone who enjoys bizarre hyperrealism with just a splash of horror. The pacing works well, with the steady build up culminating in an intense climax that mirrors the main character's emotional state of mind. ""Worm"" is unique, exciting and thought provoking. Definitely a movie I will be coming back to. In a world without dreams, what will you do to get your fix?",1436313600,,572,4.673267326732673
8660874,4,B00KQVSD3Y,"A dark commentary on modern culture with a twist of science fiction. I enjoyed the film's slow pacing, mirroring the main character's gradual descent into addiction and madness. The second half of the film is well worth the wait. Some truly excellent shots mixed in here. The direction exhibits hints of a young Gondry with elements of a Fincher and Kubrick. Reading that the dialog was almost entirely improvised is impressive, to say the least. Great independent film-making on a next-to-nothing budget. Recommended if you enjoy bizarre films that are difficult to encompass in a single word or genre.",1425168000,,603,5.101010101010101
8660875,4,B00KQVSD3Y,"I really enjoyed this pretty humorous tale - it did remind me of other sci-fi films (Total Recall, etc.) in which the client is offered an alternate life experience. This one was more personal, with better character development, and I ended up renting it twice, actually, in the same week.",1421366400,2,289,4.8
8660876,5,B00KQVSD3Y,"Holy Moley, this is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Understated effective, cinematography, great casting. Some of the acting was a little stiff, but the well-told story more than made up for it. All the characters were people with which we can all relate, and really made me care for them.

I don't know what budget this film had, but that's immaterial: It's proof that a well told story will win out over CGI (3D, or Smell-o-rama, or whatever) any time!",1417305600,,467,4.4941176470588236

This is an extremely well realized low-budget dystopian film. Charlie, the main character, is the sort of guy who would be hard to like in real life, but actor John Ferguson makes it easy to sympathize with him onscreen, even when he makes some very questionable choices. I've watched this twice now, and will probably watch again in a few years. Despite the low budget, I never felt like I was being cheated of anything. What limited special effects money was available went into photoshopping some billboards and creating an awesome dream sequence with two massive dogs. Ferguson's real-life father plays Charlie's dad, and Jes Mercer succeeds as a romantic character even when her face is covered in lesions and her nose is bleeding due to the presence of worms nesting inside her brain. Also notable are Sarah Shoemaker as TV reporter ""Nosey"" Posey Mapleton and Shane O'Brien as June's cheating' boyfriend Reed.
The style of this film reminds me a lot of another low-budge fave, Guy Crawford's Autopsy: A Love Story. Of the two, this is certainly the superior film, but if you enjoy this movie you might take a peek at the other.",1417132800,,1142,4.831632653061225

8660879,1,B00KQVSD3Y,"I watch movies like this.  Independent low budget type of movies.  So I'm open to the little gem that can be found in this arena of filmmaking.  Unfortunately ""Worm"" isn't one of those little gems.  The film is tedious and strains incoherently to convey a narrative that makes sense and entertains simultaneously.  Not that there isn't a story, there is, but it's like the actors are aware they're telling it and have to try really hard to pretend that they're not acting.  I felt like telling them, get to the point already.  Stop trying to fill up space for the sake of occupying 90 minutes of film.  The dream concept has some promise although it lacks originality, but the execution is contrived and the acting and script stretch the limits of believability.  Terrible soundtrack too.",1414800000,2,788,4.777777777777778
