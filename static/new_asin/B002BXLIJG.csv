8362475,1,B002BXLIJG,"I wanted a triathlete-focused strength training DVD with which I could do full workouts. This is part DVD in which they merely demonstrate how each exercise is done. For the actual workouts, you have to print off PDFs. If I wanted to READ a workout, I would have bought the book ""Holistic Strength Training for Triathlon""  (which I did, & much better experience) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1456724037/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1  or ""Strength Training for Triathletes"".",1417305600,,491,6.101449275362318
