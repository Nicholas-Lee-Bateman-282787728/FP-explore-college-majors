8599916,2,B00E0S9NIS,"I have just obtained a copy of the above DVD here in the UK (it's obtainable via Answers in Genesis in Leicester) and here are my thoughts on it.

The film mostly talks about the debate in general, rather than particular scientific evidence and how those on both sides of the debate may have interpreted such evidence.

With five eloquent YECs against two 'normal' scientists, there's no way this film can offer an even-handed presentation of the relevant issues.

Much of the time the film is YEC propaganda and a certain kind of 'Bible thumping' eg because there's a creator God evolution 'must' be false and a key reason it is false is that evolutionists assume that the material is all that there is.

As soon as Myers has spoken (he is not obviously unfairly edited) you get Ham and Purdom in succession trying to rubbish what he said eg about possible chemical evolution of the first cells.

You get Ham proclaiming that scientists talk about millions of years as factual because they 'want' evolution. A total distortion of the history of scientific discovery.

Purdom claims that natural selection and mutations cannot produce anything additional (in terms of genetics or morphology) - a favourite piece of YEC misinformation. She also claims that people deny design (meaning intent/planning/intelligence as well as complexity seen within life) because they don't want responsibility to a creator.

Ham tries to rubbish Eugenie Scott by implying that because she is a committed atheist she must abuse the scientific method in the same sort of biased manner that YECs do (who have certain inflexible beliefs about the past despite the scientific evidence available to us and actually pretend that the sum of the evidence is on their side not that of mainstream scientists).

Todd Cantelon is obviously biased - accusing evolutionists of believing in 'happenstance' and of 'defying' the evidence (there's no evidence that a. young Earth creationism is sound science and also b. evolution is disproven; some might argue that fine-tuning and the complexity of life could point to a god/invisible higher intelligence).

The sound quality is poor in some of the interviews that were recorded in the Creation Museum, as recorded animal noises are also heard in the background.

I would assume that Myers (wearing a crocoduck tie) and Winsor agreed to take part because otherwise the film might have featured nothing but young Earth creationists discussing in a rather dogmatic fashion the 'origins of the universe debate'.",1386806400,3,2523,5.087167070217918
8599917,2,B00E0S9NIS,I have over 90 DVD's on this subject and this is one of the worst.  I would have given only 1 star but it did have some interesting facts in it (not very many).  I wouldn't waste your money on this DVD.,1381881600,2,202,3.7857142857142856
