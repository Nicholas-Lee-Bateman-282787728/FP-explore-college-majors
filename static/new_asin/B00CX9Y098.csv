8587193,5,B00CX9Y098,"I've been a big fan of Coach Johnson's offenses for years, having studied them through whatever cutups I've been able to get my hands on, and this DVD did not disappoint. He goes into detail about the triple option and all the adjustments that a defense can throw at you, and conversely all the wrinkles he can throw right back at the defense. If you're looking for a complete overview of the offense, this isn't it, but I thought it was very informative. Even if you're someone who is very familiar with the offense, it's a good look into how Johnson thinks about defenses.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone curious about learning more.",1429488000,,648,4.6347826086956525
8587194,5,B00CX9Y098,"Coach Johnson gives a clear, straightforward presentation describing how his teams run the triple option. Anyone interested in triple option football can benefit.",1403395200,,162,6.086956521739131
