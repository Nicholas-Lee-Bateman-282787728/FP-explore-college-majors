2945129,5,B00003G4IF,"I bought this 'cause I'm a fan of the Sopranos, and I was pleasantly surprised by this gem.  It's really funny, in a way almost ""Dry as a martini"" and has tons of great mob humor.  The acting is first rate,  especially by David Proval and Tony Sirico who are maybe better here than  in the Sopranos.  The '50s setting is real cool too.  Neat old cars and a  complete Brooklyn feel.  A great movie.",951955200,5,397,4.2
