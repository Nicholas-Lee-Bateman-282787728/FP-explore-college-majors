7855809,5,6303922821,"Sidney Poitier plays an idealistic new teacher in a rough London high school, where the kids are used to browbeating the faculty. He gets nothing but disrespect and abuse, until he decides to focus on life skills instead of academics they may never need. He gets involved in their lives outside of school, and the students gradually come to respect  and even love him. The film follows him through one school year, which may be his last.

This movie is pretty predictable - hardened delinquents are changed forever by the devotion of a young teacher - but has never been done better.  Poitier has such charm and charisma that you will really enjoy and believe every minute. He brings warmth, honesty, and dignity to the role.  I recommend this film to his many fans, to future teachers who also want to change the world, and to everyone who was once a student and had a special teacher who cared about them.
