1110089,1,6306010939,"This movie is the kind of garbage you might find on the Lifetime channel.  I was embarrassed for the actors who appeared in this gut-wrenching emotion-fest.  Both Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connolly are fine actors, and anyone offended by mawkish sentimentality will wince at some of the lines they are made to speak in this in this awful, maudlin, frustrating movie.
Billy Crudup plays a super-decent, super-caring, super-sensitive Democratic (of course--just one of this movie's many cliches) Congressional contender. Jennifer Connolly is his lover from some 10 years ago, who he believes has been killed in Chile rescuing people from a despotic regime.  Their affair is told through flashbacks. They have long senstive conversations.  When they fight, they don't really fight--they are both too decent to yell at the other.  They just look hurt, and we *know* that this is a very meaningful non-fight. Naturally, he is a gentle lover; she weeps during sex. Everyone in this movie is terribly earnest, and LOVES to talk about what they're feeling. In other words: This is the ber Chick Movie!
But then, when Crudup's character is running for office, he begins seeing Connolly...around, sometimes out of the corner of his eye, sometimes everywhere, a flock of her coming at him.  It seems likely...likely that she's alive...or is it his imagination?  We're never given a convincing reason why, if Connolly is still alive, she has been in hiding all these years, or how such a sensitive, decent person could justify doing what she did to him.  If she isn't alive...then ole Fielding is hallucinating and is, therefore, a psychopath, and the whole idea that he could sustain a campaign, let alone get elected, is laughable.
There is one remarkably inept scene in which Crudup's character Fielding is eating with Connolly, her church coworkers (two priests), and 4 Chilean nationals they have just rescued.  One of the Chilean women confronts Fielding on his desire to become a politician, condemning him specifically for becoming an American politician, and we--like Fielding--feel the others in the room silently agreeing with her.  Fielding explodes (but decently!), pointing out their hypocrisy, and how, despite the world's finger-pointing at Americans, it is OUR shores they so often wash up on when fleeing the terror of their homelands.  Finally, he declares that he is ""choking on the collective superiority in this room!"" It is a good line, and he delivers a great tirade...but everyone (except, perhaps, the Chileans) in this movie is so darn nice, and good and wholesome, that we can't believe for a minute that they can't see Fielding's goodness, too.  So their collective superiority...it just doesn't ring true.
In fact, very, very little in this movie rings true.  This is the sort of movie a 14-year-old girl wanting an adult love story might like; it displays precisely that sort of idealized emotional maturity.  Few discerning adults will be able to stomach it.  Even my wife (who is the reason I sat through it) disliked it.
Do yourself a favor.  Go rent a porno movie instead.",970531200,9,3095,5.074950690335306
1110090,5,6306010939,"After 1992's beautiful anti-war drama ""A Midnight Clear"" I was already a fan.  Then in 1996 Mr. Gordon wowed me again with ""Mother  Night.""  So now with his latest film, ""Waking The Dead,"" I  wasn't surprised at all.  He has done it again.  I loved it!  It's not that  he's done the same thing again;  he never does that.  Gordon this time has  made a beautiful love story with Billy Crudup, one of the most under rated  actors out there.  His performance is so powerful.  I don't want to ramble  on and give anything away about the movie.  Just see it and discover the  talents of the best unknown director of our time, Keith Gordon.",969062400,4,634,4.373913043478261
1110091,5,6306010939,"Waking the Dead sort-of disappeared shortly after it's first viewing at the Sundace Film Festival this year, and it's really quite a shame.  Written and Directed by Keith Gordon (Mother Night), Waking the Dead tells  the story of Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup), a young man hoping to change  the world within the political system. He encounters Sarah  Williams(Jennifer Connely), a charity oriented, kind spirtied woman who  hopes to change the world in spite of the system. The two fall very deeply  in love, easily overcoming their differences. The tone changes, however,  and Sarah dies in a car bombing while helping to assist a small country. We  catch up with Fielding several years down the road, caught up in an  important political race. However, somewhere deep inside, we see that he's  changed, and haunted by Sarah. He begins to believe he sees her throught  his world. Suddenly he has to decide if she still lives, and if so, what is  he willing to sacrifice to be with her again.  The performances are what  delivers this film. Crudup, who's curging career resemlbes that of his  character, nails the role. Connely, who shakes off her earlier acting  criticisms, compliments and hinges the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed and  really related to this film. It creates wonderfully simplistic moments, and  carries you through what would be a very depressing film at the hands of a  less talented cast and crew",965692800,23,1421,4.944915254237288

Two people so clearly meant to ""meet"", find a shared interest which leads to passion, but soon is impacted with struggle.

1110199,3,6306010939,"I found the story line interesting and haunting.  My only problem was I felt the female lead actress not all that believable in this all consuming romance until the end of movie.

1110200,4,6306010939,"Based on a novel of the same title by Scott Spencer. Producer Jodie Foster pitched this movie as ""GHOST for grown ups"". The tale is about two lovers who possess great passion for one another (Jennifer Connelly and Billy Cruddup improvised many scenes to get comfortable with their characters for love scenes and the like) but though both liberal for their times they have very different means as to solving various problems.
It isn't a spoiler to say that the female love interest dies and the man tries to get on with his life but keeps seeing her wherever he goes. It gets to the point of whether his visions of her are of him expressing his grief or him actually seeing her.

Anyway, the man, who had always dreamed of becoming a politician, becomes one but is then jaded. Notice the colors going out in the later years of his life to reflect his loss of idealism in politics. There are some very interesting themes about love which is probably the main reason as to why the novel was turned into a movie. When you love somebody and they become a part of your life they're still going to be real to you in your life even if they're dead or faraway or out of your life romantically. That's the big point about love. For this man yes she may be dead or something else but she had an impact on his life and stays in his heart until his dying days and maybe thereafter.

By the way, this is one of those rare Jennifer Connelly movies that shows her acting talents which is a nice change from her being the oh so ""pretty-chesty"", supportive girlfriend. Younger men won't get this picture or so the stats said when they tested it. During the testing that group was uncomfortable with the movie. No surprise there. The ending has a nice turnaround as the main character begins to see the world as his girlfriend saw people: in pain and in need of compassion. It probably didn't make much a ton at the Box Office but it said a lot more to me about the human experience than most of the summer action flicks.

I generally hate love stories like a cinematic disease! However, this movie is quite different in its approach and execution. Even the sappy, cutesy parts are good! I found myself feeling (haven't done that in a while) for these characters and actually caring what happens to them! Billy Crudup is very convincing in his role as the button-down, more conservative politician to Connelly's idealistic flowerchild. Together, they have undeniable chemistry that makes the whole story work. WTD can be seen on several levels including the political, supernatural, romantic / emotional / psychological, and spiritual. It's also a bit of a mystery. I know of director Keith Gordon through his roles in CHRISTINE and DRESSED TO KILL. He is now one excellent movie-maker...",1275696000,3,893,5.165517241379311
1110204,1,6306010939,"""Waking the Dead"" is about an ambitious man who falls in love with an idealistic hippie woman.  The love is deep but the issues that divide them are deeper.  After she dies, he tries to get on with his life but keeps seeing her.

We are pulled back and forth between the 1970's and 1980's.  Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudu) is a young Coast Guard officer with political ambitions.  He meets and falls in love with Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly) a young hippie-type idealist that is also Catholic and supports their causes.  She has doubts about her role as his wife as he climbs the political ladder.

Fielding sees a news show on Sarah's death.  A news anchor reports on a car bombing in Minneapolis following a church mission to Chile.  Sarah wants to help the oppressed resist Chile's right wing government.  After the news show, Fielding has flashbacks, hears Sarah's voice, sees a young Sarah and cannot forget her.

He feels he is going crazy with his unresolved grief.  After he is elected Senator, Sarah comes to his office for a last goodbye.  Finally he gets closure and understands what Sarah felt about their relationship.  They love each other deeply but have different political and life views.

""Waking the Dead"" is overwrought and needs resuscitation.",1270857600,,1268,4.832558139534884

1110206,4,6306010939,"Perhaps Americans are simply ignorant of recent history, but still, I have a hard time believing that no one writing a review of this film has mentioned that Scott Spencer and Keith Gordon based the character of ""Sarah"" very closely on an actual person:  Ronni Moffitt, the young political activist killed in the car-bomb assassination of Chilean Orlando Letelier in 1976.  (agents of the Pinochet regime were convicted of the murders).  Some might say the particulars of Moffitt's life shouldn't really have much to do with the success or failure of Waking the Dead as a fictional dramatic work, and in a narrow sense, that's true.  But as the nature of this movie is the struggle of the higher duty of idealism vs. the earthly satisfaction of love, the real-life activism of Moffitt is relevant because of the way it ""grounds"" the idealism of Sarah.  As much as conservative believers in the supremacy of the self might want to think it absurd, there really were and are people who sacrific to make things better.  And the dramatic ""path"" of this movie is Fielding's slow back-and-forth realization, though the thickets of his lost love, of the ultimate importance of idealistic sacrific.  This is why the movie's final scene (don't worry -- I won't give it away here), which no one else has mentioned, is so crucially important.
  On the filmmaking details I have little to add.  Crudup and Connelly, superb in so many other films, are superb here.  Gordon's flashback-and-forward technique occasionally seems artsy but functions well enough in conveying the story.  Challenging and moving.",1233100800,11,1593,4.992424242424242
1110227,4,6306010939,"""Waking the Dead"" is a good drama.  I found the central premise moving.  Fielding Pierce loses his girlfriend Sarah to an act of violence.  His longing for her is so strong after her passing that his desire to see her begins to make him question his sanity.  Anybody who has lost someone important to them should be able to relate.  Billy Crudup from ""Mission Impossible III"" plays the young lawyer/politician Fielding Pierce.  He takes the performance to the edge with his desperation.

Set in the early 1970s and the early 1980s, the story follows Crudup, an up and coming brilliant law student who wants to be president someday. Connelly is the girl he falls for, and she's a radical who takes on all kinds of causes, ultimately ending in her tragic death...or is she really dead?

In the 80s, Crudup starts seeing Connelly and thinks she might be losing his mind, which wouldn't serve his goals as a candidate for Congress.

The movie is long on dialogue and director Keith Gordon gives us some pretty visual images and elicits good performances from the cast.

But the real situation with Connelly's fate is romanticized and ultimately left for us to decide the truth.

Sarah Williams and Pierce Fielding fall upon chance during the last years of the Vietnam War (1972). Fiedling, a young ambitious man with dreams of becoming a senator finds his life entangled with his lover, Sarah. Sarah, a devoted activist who is dedicated to her missionary work loves Fielding so much that it is in fact ""infuriating"" and that feeling is mutual as well. Sarah and Fielding are deeply in love but their careers are so different and so demanding that it does seem implausible for this couple to succeed. Fielding and Sarah both know their careers are on total opposite sides of the field but manage to cope with patronizing politicians or sensitive activists; however, Fieldings life is drastically  changed when Sarah dies in a car bomb in chile. Fielding, distraught over his loss, moves on; before you know it it is the year 1982; he enagages in a new relationship with his mentor's niece and is offered a seat in the senate after working with the Chicago DA. Things are all happening way too fast for Fielding as he must prepare for his close election. Things take a turn for fielding as he experiences auditory and visual hallucinations of Sarah and creates these dillusions. Why are these visions haunting him now after all these years? His family having a pertained liking to Fielding's fiance, Sarah, are concerned for him and worried about his ill being. Is love haunting or is it possible to literally wake the dead?

This movie is stunning, an outstanding performance by both Jennifer Connelly and Billy Crudup. It is a shame to see the little amount of recognition this film recieves now as well as at the box office in 2000. However, Their on screen chemistry is plausible with realistic dialogue along with a touching soundtrack. What makes this Romantic movie distinct and unique besides the beautiful Jennifer Connelly  is the satisfaction of the ending; it does not leave the audience guessing or pondering upon the thought of is she alive is she dead...instead we rely upon the alleviation of Fielding's unrest and his new career ahead of him. He is content after all and his soul as well as Sarah soul can finally be at rest.",1164499200,5,2436,4.724705882352941

(Almost Famous, Jesus' Son) plays Fielding, an aspiring Senator who meets

Sarah (Oscar Winner Jennifer Connelly) who's one of those foreign activists simalar to Angelina Jolie. Despite their differences, Fielding and Sarah fall in love until Sarah dies in a car bombing accident...Apparently. The movie jumps between 1973 & 1974 to 1984, where Fielding is now running for Congress and is dating his mentor's niece. But, for some reason, Fielding (and a few other people) see Sarah occasionally; She has even called him.

But Fielding doesn't know if it's a figment of his imagination or if he actually woke the dead. I think that the problem with this movie is that it deals with the political aspect a little bit more than it needs too. I want to see the Fielding and Sarah love story more than I wanted to see Fielding's blossoming political career. But this is a pretty good movie and a lot of the scenes are effective. I like how the writer didn't cave at the end of the movie and come up with some ridiculous excuse for an ending and instead left us to wonder. Crudup & Connelly are both great in their roles, especially Crudup.

The dialouge between the two, I thought was quite good as well. Like:

Sarah: Sometimes it's so infuriating loving you.

Fielding: The feeling's mutual.

Little things like that that go unnoticed. Anyway, really good movie and I highly recommend it.

Or, perhaps it is a story about a troubled politician who suffers from hallucinations.  That is for the viewer to decide.  In either case, it is a good movie in an ""artsy"" sort of way.

This is perhaps the most surreal film I've ever seen.  Just like the main character, it is difficult for us to separate dreams from reality in this movie.  The gorgeous Jennifer Connolley once again proves that she is a bona-fide actress as opposed to just another pretty face in Hollywood.

This movie is recommended to all fans of Jennifer, as well as people who enjoy films that break away from the norm.  While it's almost impossible to put your finger on what, exactly, this movie is ""about,"" it's still well worth the opportunity to try.",1132444800,5,836,4.483443708609271
1110276,5,6306010939,"Jodie Foster was the executive producer on this haunting film about a real love between two people which may even be strong enough to transend death. Jennifer Connelly could easily have garnered an Oscar here if anyone had noticed. This is a real film about real people, filled with quiet passion and heartbreak. The questions it poses are not easily answered. Can we ever forget real love and move on? Are those we loved still with us somehow after death?

Jennifer Connelley is Sarah Williams, a young and bright girl with a heart too full of love and compassion to let injustice rule the world. She is trying to make a difference through her church's efforts in Chile to smuggle out refugees when a bomb explodes, changing the life of her lover Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) forever.

What follows are shifts in time as we see the young John Kennedy-like Fielding find true love with this wonderful girl who doesn't seem to fit in with his political aspirations. It is a real and tender love explored more fully by director Keith Gordon than we often see today in films. Sarah becomes the cricket on his shoulder, his conscience for all that is good.

But years later he still can not move on from that moment when his life ended. It is as though his soul was killed in the blast as well. Fielding is about to become a congressman while at the same time unsure if he is losing his sanity. A snowy night turns dark and he feels Sarah in the snow surrounding him. He begins to see her watching him. Is it possible she is still alive? Or is love reaching across the threshold of death.

We may not have any conclusive answers when this film is over as we are left haunted as well, which was the point. Crudup is terrific as a phone call brings him to the brink of a mental breakdown and Connelly gives a haunting performance as the love that saves him once more. How she does so is left up to us. This is a somber and beautiful meditation on love and how lucky we are to ever find it.

The shifts in time are mesmerizing in this richly romantic and hauntingly beautiful film you must see. It is genuinely unique and never to be forgotten once you have.",1118620800,20,2153,4.413098236775818
1110277,4,6306010939,"Waking Up The Dead is mysterious story about undying love, desires, and politics clash between two star-crossed lovers played by Jennifer Connelly(Sarah) and Billy Crudup(Fielding). There are many irreconcilable differences between the them, but for some reason, they were destined to be together for a some divine purposes, and both refuse to compromise their interests.

Sarah is a church activist, and she goes out of her way to make the world a better place, including taking on life-threatening volunteer work in Chile. Her Boyfriend Fielding was raised by high-society politician parents, and he intended to ran for senator. She's very outspoken, and caused quite a scene when she expressed her angry opinions toward his fellow politician. During her sanctuary mission in Chile, she was reported dead in an attack, but it's not clear whether she did die or just faked it. Her ""death"" changed Fielding a great deal, and in the course of ten years span, he constantly thought about her, and imagined her still alive. His perspective and intensions on being a politician also gets reconsidered during election. Ultimately, he's the dead that gets awaken, because he was careless and selfish before Sarah ""died"". She had ""come back"" from the dead to awaken his true passion and kindness, so that he wouldn't become just part of the corrupted world of politicians.

Jennifer Connelly and Billy Crudup had plenty of chemistry together, but she's more striking in group scenes. He's quite impressive when he gets the anxiety attack moments. Janet Mcteer's part is not very challenging for her, considered that she had done great work in the Oscar-nominated Tumbleweeds. Most disappointing thing was the casting of Sandra Oh as a Korean Massage worker. She get to deliver two lines in an supposedly authentic Korean accent, and she had just two scenes total. She really didn't have to take this tiny role, because she's a multi-award winning actress from Canada!",1114041600,4,1960,5.141065830721003

the quiet indie flick as opposed to the hyped-up, mega-budget blockbuster, the pace of it dragged at points. That being said, though, by the end I was in tears. I identified with the loss of a loved one, and the ensuing thought that I was haunted by their presence, followed by my near descent into madness. Fielding and Sarah's relationship (the movie version- not the book) rung to the tune of ""Love Story"" to me, once again a tale of two people who challenge each other daily with conflicting ideas and behaviors, but who are magnetically attracted to one another despite it all. I love this movie and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a movie with great internal conflict.",1110672000,6,809,4.541095890410959
1110279,5,6306010939,"Keith Gordon has again bowled me over with a magnificent piece of filmmaking.  ""Waking the Dead"" shares many of the same elements as his ""A Midnight Clear"" (still in my view the best WWII drama of modern times) -- a skillful adaptation of a powerful novel,  intense performances from the entire cast, and careful attention to the rhythm and pacing of his story.  And two other things that are especially rare in today's mainstream movies: the deliberate ambiguity of the ending and nuanced characters that are neither black nor white but multiple shades of grey. Hollywood must hate this, and it must baffle many moviegoers.  The general public is force-fed so many lifeless, undemanding,  predictable movies with cardboard characters that they probably didn't reward this gem at the box office (Gordon's commentary track implies that this movie was a semi-flop, commercially, which is tragic -- and probably makes it only harder for him to continue to shoot quality films).  One hopes ""Waking the Dead"" will find its audience on home video, much as the well-respected ""A Midnight Clear"" (which I saw several times in the theatre) seems to have.

Another reviewer has pointed out the double-meaning behind the title -- the ""dead"" here refers to both Sarah, believed to be physically dead, and Fielding, who has found his soul wasting away since losing her.  Can Fielding bring himself  as well as Sarah back to life?  The story  is  also tellingly noncommittal as to Sarah's actual status.  By the end of the film, we still don't know if Sarah is  secretly alive, a ghost from the other side, or simply a product of Fielding's mental breakdown.  Everything in the script leaves the question wide open for interpretation, and the effect is both chilling and intensely moving.  The emotional wave of the story builds to a final confrontation between the principal characters that is truly heart-rending.

I think this is one of those movies best served by a review that does not give away too many surprises or attempt to detail too much of the plotline.  Suffice to say that if you appreciate a human-scale drama that operates on several levels of meaning, you will find yourself drawn in by this one and riveted by the performances of Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly.  It's a film that only gets richer and more rewarding with every viewing.  Looking for a love story/ghost story for grown-ups? ""Waking the Dead"" is a sure-fire winner.

Some parting notes:

Most directors  today hit you over the head with the soundtrack music and then lazily try to let the songs carry the picture.  While Gordon is not totally above this contemporary shorthand, he has enough good taste and filmmaking savvy not to let this technique dominate these scenes. And his musical selections are spot-on.

Although Connelly and Crudup are THE key players, the entire cast  is outstanding, and deserves a bow.

The DVD extras are generous and revealing.  Unlike the deleted scenes from Gordon's ""A Midnight Clear,"" which did seem disposable, I felt all these cut scenes SHOULD have been restored for a ""Waking the Dead"" Extended Cut.  It's sad that they can't  be part of the regular narrative; they add a wealth of character development and detail that would have made the theatrical version even richer.  Ed Harris, in particular, is deservedly singled out  by Gordon's commentary and reviewers here for his exceptional  portrayal of a disgraced congressman.

I read the book AFTER I saw the film, being inspired to learn more about this story's genesis.  While very fine, I have to say that I still prefer the movie and its more immediate impact.  But that's par for the course -- I tend to always prefer the medium in which I was first exposed to something, be it print form or cinematic.  I would recommend the novel to anyone who likes the picture.  But I  note with some bemusement that Fielding seems a much less likable fellow in the book.",1107475200,31,3928,4.867269984917043
1110280,4,6306010939,"I read ""Waking the Dead"" a few months before watching the movie.  I was thus certainly biased in a certain direction in favor of the book.

Keith Gordon, who also directed the outstanding and under-appreciated films ""A Midnight Clear"" and ""Mother Night"", stays pretty much faithful to the original material by Scott Spencer.  It's obvious that films are different than books and directors need a certain amount lattitude to change the story as needed.  Gordon certainly left a lot of the story on the cutting room floor and that is, for the most part, not a problem.

What is the problem is that Gordon didn't flesh out Sarah's story and, as a result, offers a skewed ending that the book doesn't share.

Spoiler Alert

Sarah and Fielding are not ""opposites"" as many suggest.  They happen to agree politically.  They're both ""liberals.""  Where they disagree is on tactics.  The problem with the film is that we don't really see enough of Sarah to understand just how different her tactics are compared to Fielding and why, ultimately, she chose to go away.  The movie's ending is ambiguious about the fate of Sarah.  Did she die or didn't she?  The book shares some of this approach, but it strongly leans in the direction of Sarah having faked her death.  In the book Fielding meets with a priest who states that Sarah is alive.  And when Sarah and Fielding finally meet at the end Sarah explains how she is living underground and continuing her work.  We're given, at least in the text, a reason why Sarah chose the path that she did.  Gordon, however, mostly gives us Fielding's side of things.  In the process he detracts from the central conflict and ends up with a rather wishy-washy ending.

I strongly recommend this film.  The DVD has many interesting extras, including many deleted scenes and a commentary by Gordon.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything on the DVD from the original author, Scott Spencer.  That's too bad because I think he could have added some really interesting insights about the story overall.  And of course, read the book which is, as usual, even better than the movie.",1090022400,19,2116,4.765840220385675

1110292,4,6306010939,"Things get a little too cute at the end of ""Waking the Dead,"" and while I appreciate the idea of leaving up what ""really"" happened to the audience, I do not think that this was the film was the one in which to try this particular trick.  After all, this movie is not a ghost story, even though the main character is haunted by the dead woman that he loved, but a film that mixes romance and politics to the point where the film's big question really matters and should have been answered more directly.
In 1982 a stunned Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) learns form the evening news that the woman he loves, Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connely) has been killed by a car bomb attack because of her involvement in opposing the corrupt government of Chile and U.S. involvement.  We then go back to see how they first met, when he was serving in the Coast Guard, to avoid going to Vietnam, and she was the secretary for his brother, who is running some sort of counter culture magazine.  He longs for a career in politics and she wants to bring down the system.  Yet when Fielding says he wants to be president some day, she smiles because he clearly means it.
These two characters from Scott Spencer's novel are politically polarized and these differences only grow as the two fall in love.  They take turns accompanying each other to important social functions at which the other one become an embarrassment, before Sarah goes off and gets killed for her beliefs.  Ten years later Fielding is given the opportunity to run in a special election for a seat in the U.S. Congress, as the handpicked choice of the governor and his chief political hack (Hal Holbrook).  This is the first step to what Fielding has wanted his entire life, only Sarah sees it as a betrayal.  True, Sarah has been dead ten years at this point, but that does not stop Fielding from first hearing and then seeing her.
Is Fielding going insane, is he being haunted, or is this some sort of sick game?  Good question, but do not ask me the answer because I watched the movie.  It is hard to spoil a movie when you are not sure what really happened at the end, although I could hazard a guess.  Ultimately, the politics clashes between Fielding and Sarah are more interesting than their romance.  You have to wonder how their relationship would have ended if she had not died, because sooner or later one of them would have had to blink.  One of the strengths of ""Waking the Dead"" is that both of them are right and you think that if only they could find a way to work together great things could happen.
""Waking the Dead"" is one of those titles that has a double meaning, for it applies to Fielding as much as it does to Sarah.  That sense of ambiguity pervades Keith Gordon's 2000 film and certainly explains why the ending is so open to interpretation.  But for me it does not quite work in the end, although Fielding's scene in his Congressional office works much better than his dinner with his family.  Still, this is an interesting film for those who like to see film that try to play with an audience's mind (and which should be avoid like the plague by those who did enjoy ""Fight Club"" or ""Memento"").",1075593600,3,3171,4.469670710571924
1110293,4,6306010939,"Both Jennifer Connely and Billy Crudup shine in this heart-wrenching film about lost love.  I was particularly moved by Billy Crudup's amazing performance.  It was filled with anger and confusion, longing and despair, but ultimately hope.  His acting here is as good as any actor could possibly attempt; some of his scenes are so intense that they seem out of place with the rest of the movie, and only Jennifer Connelly ever keeps up with him.  The remaining scenes show him numb with the loss of his true love.  His performance is truly remarkable.  There is also a ""sex"" scene between Jennifer and Billy that was pulled off so convincingly that it looked as though they actually were making love.  The intensity they both bring to that scene is genuinely amazing.  There is also another montage of scenes that takes place late in the film with the Peter Gabriel song ""Mercy Street"" played in full that is so perfectly placed it seemed as thought the song were written specifically for this film.  Another remarkable moment.  The pace is deliberately slow, the plot jumps back and forth in time, and some of the scenes seem staged for the benefit of Billy Crudup, but overall this is a moving experience.  The writing is also excellent but sounds more like a play than a screenplay.

Waking the Dead tells the story of Fielding Pierce (Crudup), a congress hopeful who years earlier lost his true love Sarah (Conelly) in Chile.  Throughout the entirity of the movie, the film flashes back and fourth in time as we see how the two meet, fall in love, and long for each other, until the tragedy which changes Fielding forever.  Crudup is incredible, words alone can't describe how good this guy is in this role.  After watching this for the first time, I can honestly say that he was robbed out of even an Oscar nomination.  The way the film shifts back and fourth through time could have led to disastrous results, but it is handled exceptionally well by director Keith Gordon who pulls exceptional performances from the two leads.

1110295,3,6306010939,"What an ambitious confluence of love, loss, devotion, idealism, insanity, and remembrance.  Billy Crudup plays the political aspirant Fielding Pierce, and he brings to light yet another screen character with the radiance of a solar flare.  Jennifer Connelly is something more rare, perhaps, more valuable--she seems to portray in the activist Sarah Williams the perfect human being.  Yet an impenetrable fabric is drawn between these two lovers, the form of which is raised by Sarah's violent death while engaging in political unrest in Chile.  Yet the intensity of Fielding's longing, or the strength of Sarah's soul, appears to have the power to resurrect her, as she begins to appear to Fielding in haunting glimpses.  Wonderfully, this film takes for granted that love can transcend even death as simply and easily as a person can breathe.
What a disappointment then that the center of this piece is so unsatisfyingly jumbled.  Supporting characters are revealed to be flimsy characters callously used as mere props who have no life of their own but are used strictly to advance each scene to its conclusion.  Most notoriously, the fine Sandra Oh is tragically miscast in a downright offensive turn as a half-intelligible prostitute.  The story seems to dwell interminably on Crudup's Fielding in the throes of struggle to hold fast to his thread of lucidity as his political career verges towards its culmination in his race for a Congressial seat, even as his inner world is crumbling further with each passing minute.  Can he keep his agony in check?  The answer to this concern seems to fade to meaninglessness as he stumbles along the campaign trail, abusing his chances at office and his relationships with those still remaining in the land of the living.  Perhaps this movie loses its center of gravity because director Keith Gordon and writer Robert Dillon craft a world that, although admirably fixated on the emotional life and consciousness shared by the two stars, does not care enough about the rest of the world for it to serve the story as a stabilizing platform when the lovers' connection is shattered.  An unworthy medium for a performance by Crudup to stand with that of FH in Jesus' Son, and what is possibly Connelly's best work.
Nonetheless credit is due this film for attempting something so wonderfully strange; it's sentiment and, most of all, its imagination and invention, must return to the screen in these days of lost heart and cynical eyes, now, more than ever.",1070582400,,2496,5.016949152542373

  The editing is choppy and sometimes Keith Gordon, the director, seems to lose focus of what kind of film he is making tonally, that is.  When he allows the leads to sit there and talk on the train after a disastrous outing the magic these actors possess becomes tangible, just absolutely great.
  This is a grown up romance that is portrayed and certainly more political and feiry than most, but it leaves a lot of questions to answered by the audience and that's rare.

A word to the wise: Be sure to get the DVD (as opposed to the VHS) because there's about 45 minutes of deleted scenes and some of them are every bit as good as the film.

Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Cuba and the US were in turmoil: in politics, in the Arts, everywhere. However, we still remained deeply marked by a certain blend of idealism, naiveness and a remarkable determination to correctness in every aspect of Life. Those values seem to have vanished in present times!
This said, it becomes easier to understand the script behind the scenes and the disturbances in Fielding's mind. Crudup's interpretation should have earned him the Oscar, but not alone.
Jennifer Connelly's Sarah was so real that has trascended her natural and amazing beauty to produce a couple in love which rarely exists today.
Their love scenes approached moments of ECTASY very few actor/actresses have the power to produce so realisticaly. Jennifer's path to her deserved Oscar with A Beatiful Mind was clearly set thereat.
One must have lived those experiences to understand that everything in the movie looks like watching tapes - of real life - long buried in his/her mind.

1110322,5,6306010939,"Writer-director Keith Gordon's ""Waking the Dead"" caught me off guard and - dare I say it? - moved me to tears. But what's almost as sad as the movie itself is that this 1999 release - which works beautifully as both a tragic love story and a psychological thriller - slipped in and out of theaters virtually unnoticed.
Based on the novel by Scott Spencer, the film opens in 1972, where we meet Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup), a young U.S. Coast Guard officer with big political ambitions. He meets Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), a secretary and political activist who works at his hippie brother's New York publishing house, and the two are smitten right away. But tragedy strikes ...
Without giving too much away, I will say that ""Waking the Dead"" cuts back and forth between the early '70s and the early '80s, producing a subjective, stream-of-consciousness narrative that manages to be compelling instead of confusing. Also, I liked the use of color and lighting to visually differentiate between the '70s scenes (warm earth tones) and the '80s scenes (cold, dark colors).
But unlike ""The Matrix"" and ""Memento,"" which used subjective narrative to play head games with the audience as its central gimmick, ""Waking the Dead"" is after bigger game. The ambiguity surrounding Sarah underscores how deeply her memory haunts Fielding, the toll it has taken on his mental state, and how deeply they love each other, despite the cruel blow fate has dealt them.
The soundtrack also features lovely songs by Joni Mitchell (""A Case of You""), Lori Carson (""Snow Come Down"") and Peter Gabriel (""Mercy Street""); alas, no soundtrack CD was ever made. The DVD also includes 45 minutes of deleted scenes, including a brief but engaging performance by Ed Harris, whose character only appeared onscreen (in TV footage, no less) for about 10 seconds in the final cut.
Just make sure you have a box of tissues and a wastebasket handy before you push ""play."" You have been warned.",1028592000,22,1965,4.921686746987952
1110323,4,6306010939,"The film itself, the style and political aspect/theme, did not impress me. There's nothing particularly compelling about the flashbacks-style wise-that drive the story. But what sets this film apart from others, what motivated me to keep watching, was Billy Crudup. Granted, I'm incredibly taken with this outstanding actor, but his performance in *Waking the Dead* surprised even me.
Crudup would have been the finest of actors in the days of silent movies because his facial expressions are exquisite. He need never speak a word and yet you would swear that you felt every emotion that his character felt right along with him. In my mind there is no one comparable to him in this regard. Perhaps it is just that he has this truly remarkable presence. You want to watch him no matter what subject he is dealing with on screen because he somehow makes you care.
Aside from his acting, or perhaps more aptly *because* of it, this movie is painfully, beautifully, intimate. At times it felt like I was witnessing things I had no right to. And because of that atmosphere I knew I had to own it within twenty-four hours of viewing it.",1018656000,7,1130,4.770408163265306
1110324,2,6306010939,"Rarely does one find a film that is so intensely hostile towards American values.  Jennifer Connelly brilliantly portrays the young radical Leftist, Sarah Williams, who has nothing but contempt for the United States.  She meets her soul mate Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) and proceeds to guilt trip him into also sharing her political beliefs.  How anti-American is Sarah?  In one scene she tells Fielding that she hopes he does not go to Vietnam because she supports the North Vietnamese Communists!  Sarah perceives America as the beginning and end of most evil in the world. Fielding is ironically committed to becoming the President of the United States.  There is much friction between the two lovers because Fielding sees the importance of compromise.  Sarah, however, will settle for nothing less than absolutist ideological purity.
""Waking the Dead"" flash backs from the early 1980s to the early 1970s.  The lovers meet and eventually Sarah gets involved with a very Left wing religious group who is bringing into the country a couple escaping from Chile.  All three are supposedly murdered in a car bomb explosion.  But is Sarah really dead?  Were the
authorities truly able to identify her body after the blast?  Fielding is not sure whether he is losing his mind.  He is running for the U.S. Congress and constantly imagines hearing Sarah's voice and seeing her on the street.  Fielding is involved with Juliet (Molly Parker) who is the niece of his political mentor, Issac.  Juliet is sexually available and she might make an appropriate wife for an aspiring politician.  But will she be able to compete against the memory of the missing Sarah? The story line becomes very convoluted at this point.  One's patience is severely tested for the rest of the film.
Should anyone make a point to see ""Waking the Dead?""  The answer is in the affirmative if you wish to observe Jennifer Connelly at her best.  She is truly a remarkable actress and it is easy to understand why Connelly was later picked to star in the very recent ""A Beautiful Mind.""  Connelly brings a presence to the screen that is almost always riveting and unforgettable. That alone might be a valid reason for adding ""Waking the Dead"" to your collection.  Does Director Keith Gorton actually believe that America is such a despicable nation?  If so, I will have to remind myself to ignore his future movies.",1016236800,5,2383,4.919799498746867

1110326,5,6306010939,"This is a rare film powered by its incredible imagery that is heart-breaking and beautiful at the same time.  Once you begin to become immersed in Fieldings mental wanderings between the past and present, it doesn't let you go.  From the beginning to the end, the story of the ill-fated romance between an aspiring politician and an activist is gripping and passionate.  Fielding and Sarah are in love even though their ideals are often conflicting.  Yet, these are the things he loves about her as well.  This film flashes to various incidents between the couple before she is killed.  After this, Fielding tries to get over the sudden loss of Sarah and its this that drives the film until its powerful conclusion.
Its not only a romance but a search for a man's soul as he begins to try to get himself together in the face of his angst over a loss that occurred ten years before but that had never stopped haunting him.  His love for this woman has made it impossible for him to love anyone else and even as Fielding finally arrives as a popular politician, he begins to lose it when he starts to catch glimpses of Sarah everywhere he goes.  Is this a figment of the imagination, insanity or something more?  Watch this incredible film to find out.

1110327,4,6306010939,"Waking the Dead is about Fielding Pierce who is about to become a congressman, but soon we discover he is haunted by his reportedly dead lover Sarah a former political activist.
This film comes at you like a stark and haunted love story. Kieth Gordon the director flashes back and forth showing us that this wasn't always a perfect union between the two, yet they were bound together even though their political and social beliefs were as opposed as the North and South Pole. In Fielding's life post Sarah we see him as a shadow of the man he formerly was, who begins to see Sarah everywhere. This slowly wears at the fabric of his sanity. He isn't sure if he is being haunted by her ghost or if she had gone into hiding.
The amazing thing about the film is it touches on some of the real concepts of love. How you can care about a person even though they drive you insane at times. The scene between Fielding and Sarah on the subway train going home is probably the best in the film, it is very natural and speaks with a true and meaningful heart. Waking the Dead reminds us all of that one love we had that we weren't meant to hang on to.  Painful and beautiful, it is an experience worth having, one that will form who we are and who we will eventually become.",1010275200,6,1263,4.2845188284518825

As someone who has lost my beloved at age 29 due to random murder on street. The way the actor plays out grief process is just real. I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE WTHOUT EXAGGERATIONS AND CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD EMOTIONS, FOR THOSE WHO HAS LOST A LOVED ONE.
The script has exact same statements I have been telling people about how I felt.""It doesn't get any better, it just goes on,it just goes on"". The behaviour of the people surrounding the grieving actor is just the same I have experienced. All those people who tell you and try to convince you that in time you will start to feel better. But the heartbreaking fact that you never feel any better, you just stop talking about it, you get back into the daily routines and people think that time started to show its healing effect. They are unable to see what goes in your brain when walking on the street, while in a business meeting when alone at home, when making love to someone else -but your loved one-.

I found this to be the most down-to-earth love story I have ever seen. To state that the movie, for me, was a moving experience, would be a gross understatement. One of the very finest displays of acting ever produced. The main characters exude stunning love chemistry.
This is a story of destiny. The power of destiny over insurmountable odds, even that of true love. I consider this approach to love, very true to life. Some of you will not be able to relate, and some of you will. For some of you, like myself, it may be as if you are seeing you life in front of you.

This achingly beautiful, loving and soulful film, directed by Keith Gordon, took me inside characters so real and so believable I wish I had them for friends.  The story revolves around Fielding Pierce (the fine, vulnerable and nuanced actor, Billy Crudup) and Sarah Williams (the sensitive and sensuous Jennifer Connelly), who fall in love because of their differences which are also their strong and bonding similarities: they care people, and they care about the world. One is driven to change from within the 'system' and one works from the outside of it. Yet, their love is their anchor and their north star.  Using flashbacks judiciously, and heightening the story of Fielding and Sarah, the film traces Fielding's emotional and spiritual crisis after it appears that Sarah has died. With fine supporting performances, and a sharp compassionate script based upon a novel of the same name by Scott Spencer (who appears briefly), 'Waking the Dead' is a cup overflowing with adult themes after a long stretch of mostly summer adolescent celluloid ....

And it doesn't get much better. Aside from Janet McTeer's performance, the acting is lackluster. Other than a few bits of good dialogue, the characters are two-dimensional. Crudup's portrayal of a congressman is unconvincing. And you feel no empathy for his character because the lost love he's pining for is unappealing----Jennifer Connelly in a grating performance (albeit the actress is a beauty). Oh, and the jumping back and forth time line device (effective in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Out of Sight"") is becoming tiresome.

After listening and watching the director's commentary by Keith Gordon, you learn that many scenes were actually improvised by the two actors. The editing style is quite similar to Soderbergh's Out of Sight and The Limey; with its documentary feel of jump cuts and audio lead-ins. Finally, the cinematography is what helps the film's very eery, ghostly world.

Waking the Dead is neither of those things. It combines an engaging story with powerful performances by Crudup and Connelly. The movie is a thriller without the hangups thrillers are usually stuck with, and at the same time, a romantic movie that leaves you refreshed instead of having a syrupy aftertaste. Crudup continues his string of great performances, and Connelly continues to be involved in great projects. Hopefully her role will not be forgotten as quickly this time.

I got it this week and having watched it, I can honestly say it will stay with me for the rest of my life. I have been walking around in a kind of melacholy ever since the end credits rolled. I feel we would be lucky men and women, to experience the kind of true, all consumming love, that Jennifer Connelly nd Billy Crudup portray in Waking The Dead.  Both these young stars give Oscar worthy performances (of both love and personal commitment and conflict) within a tightly crafted and beautifully executed piece of cinema from writer director Keith Gordon. The design, music and cinematography in this story are haunting, adding to the depth of feeling it must surely bring out of the viewer. Indeed, I defy anyone with a soul, who's ever been in love, NOT to cry at this movie.  I have been in love with Jennifer Connelly since I was 13 years old (and I first saw her in Labyrinth and Some Girls), but this is by far and away her finest performance. Billy Crudup portrays heartbroken despair, and a near spiral into nervous breakdown, the likes of which I have never seen on celluloid.  My heartfelt recommendation is that any Amazon customer reading this, with a taste for fine human drama, buys a copy of this DVD now!

1110369,5,6306010939,"""Waking The Dead"" was almost never made.  If it weren't for Jodie Foster's production company, Scott Spencer's remarkable novel would never have seen the big screen and Keith Gordon would only be remembered primarily for the very dark indie ""Mother Night.""  Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly would never have graced the big screen together so strongly as they had in Pat O'Connor's ""Inventing The Abbotts"" and the world would never have known what true love really is.
The basic premise of the film is that young Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup), a budding politician, cannot forget his former girlfriend, Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), who was killed in a violent terrorist action years before.  As a matter of fact, as his life comes to a crossroads and he is about to enter the U.S. Senate, her face, her image, and her voice haunt his every moment, causing him to question everything about his present existence.  Fielding sees and hears Sarah everywhere around him; is she really dead, or is she still alive?
First and foremost, it should be noted that Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly show more stunning on-screen chemistry than any other couple I have ever watched before.  From the moment Crudup cries at the image of Connelly on the television, on through the next 106 minutes, you are totally convinced that these two are in love.  It is beyond captivating; as a matter of fact, it is nearly alarming how they interact.  They are just THAT perfect.  The direction and screenplay (mostly done by Keith Gordon, although the script is credited to someone else due to WGA regulation) are exquisite, not contrived and desperate as some love stories go.  The supporting cast contains Academy-Award nominees Ed Harris (in a cameo) and Janet McTeer, as well as the beautiful Molly Parker and the enormously talented Sandra Oh.  Each of them hit the mark.
Like ""Map Of The World,"" a film that came out the same week, ""Waking The Dead"" was ignored by the Academy but certainly should have been lauded for its amazing acting, direction and screenplay as well as the beautifully stark image of love lasting forever that encompassed the entire film.  For me, it is difficult to imagine how something of this calibre could have been ignored.  But, in my heart, I know that the first month of the decade gave us the best film of the next ten years.  You don't need the Academy to tell you that.  And, as a screenwriter, I hope that I am lucky enough to work with folks like Keith, Billy and Jennifer because THEY are the true talent in Hollywood today!",988934400,3,2553,4.785876993166287

Sorry! I'm a stickler for details...
However, the acting is just amazing- especially by both Jennifer Connelly and Billy Crudup.  You completely feel their characters love, pain, frustrations and fears for and with each other.

This film is a testament to such a deep true love, despite our beliefs and differences and against all odds, and the sacrifices we must make in life and to those we love.  It also makes you realize that life is so fleeting...and you don't want to ever leave someone you love on a bad note, because it may be the last time you see them...The song played in during the final credits (as well as near the end of the film) is especially beautiful, and makes the movie even more of an emotional tear jerker.

I have never seen two actors, Crudup and Connelly, so entirely enveloped in each other. They played off of each pther amazingly. With respect to the story, I feel that it speaks of the kind of love that many of us can only dream.  That one love that loves us despite our conflicting ideals, ideas, and desires.  The final scene of the movie is probably what haunted me the most. Crudup pleading for reasons.  Reasons for why his love had to leave him, and leave him the way she did. It also inspired me.

Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connolly are certainly credible actors, but how they managed to get through this script without gagging says volumes about their intestinal fortitude.  The story is your typical 60s ""Power to the People"" nonsense, combined with a little Brian de Palma ""Obsession"" (a movie 1000 times better) thrown in for good measure, with Ms. Connolly espousing left-wing clap-trap at every turn.  The best scene in the movie is when the eunuch Crudup finally lets pie-in-the-sky Connolly have it with a diatribe against the Catholic church.  It is the only time in the movie when Mr. Crudup's character shows any evidence of a spine.  And, the worst thing about this movie is Ms. Connolly's character, an arrogant, sanctimonious, pious, whiny, selfish, obnoxious, self-important worm, and those are only her good qualities!  She comes off like some modern-day Jean d'Arc, without any of the sincerity.  Case in point: she tells Mr. Crudup's character she is madly in love with him, yet when she's supposed to meet with him for dinner and study, she blows him off because little Manual (some illegal Chilean kid) is finally talking.  Well, words are nice--who doesn't want to hear that somebody loves them?---but actions are what truly matters in this life, and Ms. Connolly's character's actions undoubtedly reveal a very unappealing person.

1110387,4,6306010939,"The circumstances surrounding the death of a young woman-- a peace activist working with a church organization in Minneapolis-- and it's effect on her lover, an aspiring politician, initiates a character study underscored with mystery in ""Waking the Dead,"" directed by Keith Gordon.  The movie begins by picking up the story in 1974, with a news report of the death of one Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), then flashes back to 1972, when Sarah and Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) first met.  Then the story flashes forward to 1982, where we learn what's become of Fielding since Sarah's death.  The entire story unfolds in this manner-- flashing back and forth between `72 and `82, and finally between `73 and `83-- and it proves to be a very effective method of storytelling; it allows the viewer to get to know and understand Fielding intimately, as his character is developed succinctly through pivotal episodes in his life.  And it works just as well with Sarah's character, though her death ultimately becomes shrouded in mystery.  A good director will let his audience know in the first few minutes of a film exactly what can be expected from what follows, and from the opening frame Gordon establishes the method through which his story will be told, and it works beautifully.  Ultimately, he creates an atmosphere in which the story thrives and maintains a pace that keeps it alive, while exacting performances from his actors that conclusively make it a memorable film.  The story is character driven:  Two people share the same principles and ideals and love each other deeply, but disagree on the methods by which to effect their goals.  And Crudup and Connelly are more than up to the task of carrying the film; their respective performances are outstanding.  Connelly especially captures the depth of Sarah's commitment and drive, while presenting a physical and emotional presence that personifies `70s sensibilities, up to and including the sacrifices she is willing to bear in order to ""Make a difference"" in the world.  Crudup, meanwhile, successfully captures the essence of a young man in conflict, torn between whether to forego all in the name of principle, or to attempt to resolve the same issues through established and recognized channels of mainstream society, buying into the ""Establishment,"" as it were.  Crudup achieves an emotional level that aptly conveys the inner turmoil with which he must live without respite; a personal struggle that threatens to destroy him.  It's a powerful performance that, along with his turn in ""Almost Famous,"" should establish him as one of the best young actors in the business today.  The supporting cast includes Molly Parker (Juliet), Janet McTeer (Caroline), Paul Hipp (Danny), Sandra Oh (Kim), Hal Holbrook (Isaac) and Ed Harris in a cameo as Jerry Carmichael.  In the final analysis, ""Waking the Dead"" is a pensive, thought provoking film that will grab you intellectually as well as emotionally; Gordon maintains a tension throughout the film, and a sense of mystery, that compels the emotional involvement of the audience.  And with the riveting presence and performances of the darkly winsome Connelly and the charismatic Crudup, it makes for a satisfying film-going experience that demonstrates what the magic of the movies is all about.",981331200,5,3312,5.139664804469274
1110388,5,6306010939,"This is simply one of the best, most-intelligent, love stories I've seen.  Crudup and Connelly are amazing and amazingly beautiful.  Connelly brings so much emotion to the movie - all but the teenage boys will be crying.  This is a story about true love, the kind that changes you, the kind that becomes a part of you and exists even absent the other person.  But it's also about how hard it is to love a person without wanting to change that person into something they're not.  Also, what I really admire about this movie, is the obvious thought that went into the song selections.  They fit seamlessly with the movie, providing an almost operatic emotional effect.  The images and the music combine to produce some of those rare special moments a movie can bring.  This movie delivers emotionally, intellectually, and visually.  My one complaint with the DVD: the director's audio commentary.  Usually, this is the best bonus of any DVD, but Keith Gordon doesn't add much.  He just talks about what an inspiration his wife is, how amazing the actors are, and how he got cheated out of a screenwriting credit.  So, that's a bit of a disappointment.  But the deleted scenes are another story!  They make the DVD all the more a Must Have.  The scenes, some of them amazing (Ed Harris has a great one), really add to the story.  BUY this DVD; you won't be disappointed!",980726400,6,1367,4.656903765690377

I saw it once in the theatre in LA, and once as a rental, and as someone who has never bought a movie, this will be my first. Nevermind that Crudup may be the most subtle and underrated actor of at least this generation, that is just icing on this amazing picture. You will not once see him acting in this perfectly acted film. The story and it's sequence is so cleverly told, and if summer blockbusters are more your fare, then you're better off at the tracktor pull. If you are in love, this will make you pray with urgency that you have with your beloved what binds these two characters, and if you are not, their tenderness will help you to believe that there is hope out there for the rest of us.",977875200,2,774,4.166666666666667
1110410,5,6306010939,"I am an avid movie-goer, and I am here to say that ""Waking the Dead"" was easily the best film this year.  Billy Crudup as Fielding gives a beautifully honest portrayal, of a young politician trying to hold on to his beliefs and the beliefs of his deceased true love as he enters the ""machine.""  The dialogue is pure literature, yet not beyond everyman.  The cinematography is absolutely haunting.  You must own this film.  The DVD conatains 45 minutes of cut footage as well as a featurette.  I have yet to watch the film with Keith Gordon's commentary.  Warning:  have kleenex or a dry sleeve available.",977097600,,604,4.632075471698113
1110411,5,6306010939,"Fortunately, once in a while, you still discover movies that can  surprise you. I nearly missed director Keith Gordon's WAKING THE DEAD. But it was clearly my fault ; I had the bad idea to read two or three destructive reviews in american newspapers written by so-called professional critics and, therefore, I postponed an eventual screening for weeks. Mea culpa. Mea extrema culpa.
So WAKING THE DEAD hurted the sensibility of the rare persons who saw it because they couldn't classify this movie in a special genre. The main critique read about  WAKING THE DEAD was that, at the end of the movie, one doesn't know whether this love story has really happened or whether it has only been a dream of the guilty mind of Billy Crudup. Frankly, I don't care at all. WAKING THE DEAD is not a documentary, it's a movie about the power of love, a power which doesn't die with the death of one of the lovers. The rest is literature.
The eerie and melancholic atmosphere of WAKING THE DEAD is delicately rendered by Keith Gordon, without artificial special effects, the director using masterfully the simple language of cinema like flashbacks and a smart editing to make us feel the intensity of this love story. By the way, Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly deserve our utmost admiration for their always accurate interpretation.
Exceptional bonus features with 45 minutes of deleted scenes, a commentary and a featurette. Spanish and english subtitles.
A DVD to buy. Now.",975628800,,1465,4.856

1110413,4,6306010939,"A very compelling movie about true love, sacrifice and our own abitions... and what happens when they seemingly collide. It's a story about two very different people, with two very different views of the world, superfically opposing views - and yet they are really very much the same. All told from the main character  Fielding's point of view.
It's a story told from the middle about Fielding and Sarah, and her tragic death. It brings you through Fielding's coming to terms with her life, and his. The one thing they have in common is each other, and the real ""why"" they want what they want. It's haunting and captivating. A tale of lost love. A story about reconcilling life choices..those things we sacrifice everything for, and how we sometimes forget, what we were trying to do in the first place.
It's a tale about that reality check. Fielding coming to terms with his conscious. The ""whys"".  Maybe the true realization of his own destiny - and his true love, and what this all means when you find out maybe you somehow got lost on the way...
It's also a lesson. Love doesn't come - or go so easily. It haunts and reminds you of why you love in the first place. Sometimes the hardest choices, are the ones you don't really get to make. We long to be whole. We ""need"" that part of us that we are lacking or miss. For whom chooses who and why we love?
It's a tragedy in the traditional shakespeare sense. A great story, and great movie. A story of two people who ""need"" each other to fufill their own destiny, and they do.  Sarah just has to remind Fielding what it's all about. Even it's only his heart reminding him.",973382400,,1623,4.457912457912458
1110414,4,6306010939,"This film is fascinating.  Who would have thought that the son in Rodney Dangerfield's ""Back to School"" would grow up to become the talented Keith Gordon, Director/Writer?  Not me.  Not that I ever entertained the thought, but you get my point.
This film is haunting, sad, moving, and engaging.  It is not perfect and at times it can be frustrating.  Yet, it worked.  Usually, I like to have answers at the end of a film (that is my issue, not Gordon's).  Yet, this film didn't tie up all the loose ends--part of it's power is that you don't seem to care that it doesn't.  The film will also stay with you.  It is shot beautifully.
I have some minor quibbles with the film--Connelly (in a fine performance) sometimes loses her ""southern"" accent (whereas the English Janet McTeer is flawless) and the sub-plot about the Korean hooker and Fielding's brother danny was a waste.
Still, overall there is a quality to this film, that despite some flaws, it gets you think--and it gets you to feel.  This is more than I can say about much of what Hollywood puts out there today.
The DVD has a fascinating audio commentary and some terrific deleted scenes.  You see more of a good performance by the solid Hal Holbrook.  Ed Harris is almost unrecognizable in his small role--he contines to be one of our most talented actors.  The film looks and sounds great on DVD.
Kudos to Billy Crudup on another great job.  Jennifer Connelly is wonderful as well.  See this DVD.",972000000,2,1458,4.596899224806202
1110415,4,6306010939,"So rarely do I see a film that I consider ""art,"" but I believe that Keith Gordon has painted a near-masterpiece of the vibrant ""hues"" of two decades in our country's history. On the surface it is a love story, but as you begin to scrape away the layers, much more is revealed.

""Waking the Dead,"" in its non-linear structure, opens in 1974, as Fielding (the always brilliant Billy Crudup) is hearing news that his girlfriend Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) has been killed in a car bombing. We are then taken to 1982 when Fielding is being chosen to run for a seat in Congress. As he comes closer to reaching his life-long goals, Fielding begins to be haunted by the past. He believes that he is seeing and hearing Sarah. Did she really die? The film continues to flash back and forth between the two eras, in order to inform us of the impact the past has on the present.

Sarah is an allegory: whether she is really alive is irrelevant. She represents Fielding's lost passion and idealism. He needs to feel these again if he is truly to fulfill his ""destiny.""

Director Keith Gordon colors each era in appropriate thematic tones. The 70s (passion, nurturing) are drenched in rich, sun-kissed hues and the settings are warmly accessorized: bookshelves and kitchen cabinets overflow; colorful rugs and tapestries abound. The 80s (greed, cynicism) are cold and blue. The floors are bare; the kitchen has only rice cakes. Many scenes are shot in painterly composition. The cinematography is breathtaking.

And the acting...well, it is superb. Billy Crudup so inhabits this character that he takes you with him on his journey to madness and back again. I know of no other young actor who could so capably convey an emotional breakdown without descending into schlock. Jennifer Connelly, before her Oscar-winning role, is most convincing as the girl who would haunt you forever. There are some wonderfully realistic exchanges between the two, particularly one that is a three-minute, unedited scene of an argument.

The DVD is a worthy investment. The colors are more vibrant and the letterbox format allows you to take in every detail. And the director's commentary and deleted scenes are well worth the $15. You will learn that much of the acting was improvisational - which makes it all the more amazing - and you will learn how scenes are lit, rehearsed, etc.

There are certainly a few flaws in the film - the dialog is a bit clunky at times (""ambition is the ice on the lake of emotion"" ???) -- but this is a brilliantly directed, beautifully photographed and well-acted film.",971395200,10,2571,4.8054298642533935
1110416,4,6306010939,"Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) has one ambition: to be President of the United States.  His entire life is planned out to reach that goal.  Only he didn't plan on Sarah (Jennifer Connelly).  Sarah is a free spirited, radical human rights advocate.  We meet them on the day she dies and then flash back to the inception of their relationship in 1972.  He is The Establishment personified.  She is an iconoclast.  Two philosophies more incompatible could not possibly exist, but despite everything, they fall in love.
The story then fast-forwards to Fielding's campaign for the House of Representatives ten years after Sarah's death.  It is at this time that Fielding becomes obsessed with Sarah's ghost.  He believes he is seeing her everywhere and that he is surely losing his mind.  He begins to question his own philosophies and begins to lose his will to win the election.
The film is an engrossing character study of two very fascinating people cut of completely different cloth.  The non-linear approach used by Director Keith Gordon was both a blessing and a curse.  Sometimes it provided important character development and motivation and at others, it jumped back and forth for no good reason.  This often made the film seem disjointed and hard to follow.  Gordon's direction was only fair, though he delivered accurate period renderings especially of the 1970's.  There were too many instances of unnecessary stylizing.  For instance, there was excessive use of monologue jump cuts, where he cut from the speaker saying one thing to the same speaker in the same spot saying something else.  He used it so often that it looked like bad editing.
In addition, Gordon tended to focus on the schmaltzy romantic angle and downplayed the far more interesting philosophical tension.  He did give us some dialectic, but generally cut away when the philosophical fireworks were just getting started.  He also kept treading over the same ground in different ways.  This made the story drag.
The acting by both leads was terrific.  This film brings Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly together again, both having appeared in ""Inventing the Abbotts"".  Crudup was extremely impressive as the tormented politician.  This was an exquisitely complex character and Crudup flexed the role to the max.  Connelly was a bit more uneven in her role, sometimes playing the role with great force, but at others with a mousy self-consciousness that was inconsistent with the character.  Still, she gave Sarah great depth as both a lover and a crusader, and a convincing passion for her beliefs.
This is an absorbing but slow moving romance that is a bit heavy handed, but nonetheless interesting.  I rated it a 7/10.  It showcases good performances by two young actors we will surely hear from again.  Not recommended for impatient viewers.",971136000,,2822,5.04978354978355
1110417,3,6306010939,"I have to agree that the presentation of this film ... the direction, the acting, and the cinematographic presentation of emotion and mood ... were high quality. BUT, the movie was a true wrist-slasher despite the effort it makes in the last lines to deliver some impression of hope. There are two kinds of sad stories: one that gives the viewers the cathartic release of tears ... and those that won't allow the viewer that catharsis. This is definitely the latter. No release, no closure, just a lingering aching loneliness one can't help but feel for the protagonist, Fielding.
If you enjoy that kind of tale ... have at it. It elicits those emotions quite effectively through its odd plot and surreal style. The effect that the stories events have on Fielding are well-projected; I couldn't help empathizing with the mounting sorrow and madness that Fielding was obviously experiencing.",971136000,5,890,4.97986577181208

The scene where Fielding breaks down at the restaurant table is so authentic, I cried my eyes out. I had that exact same experience in my own life once, and it was uncanny how he nailed it.
