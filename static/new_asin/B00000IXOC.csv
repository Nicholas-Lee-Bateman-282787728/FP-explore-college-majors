1230697,3,B00000IXOC,"Captured is a very difficult movie to watch. The emotions run high for all of the major characters, with no let up. The ""Hero"" becomes a vigilantie ; the car thief becomes the victim. While the two lead  characters battled with each other; I was disappointed to see the younger  brother, Joey ( Michael Mahonen; who is a brilliant Canadian actor) left  with little or nothing to do. I wish his part had not been cut so  drastically. His was the part of the younger, devoted brother. His  character could have taken some of the brutality of the film and ballanced  it with family loyalty; creating a little sympathy  from the viewer...  making an emotional attachment we could empathise with. But, no...it went  from one brutal and harsh scene to the next. The film has some remdeming  qualities, I just wish there had been a little more of Joey, to balance the  plot...",946857600,2,869,4.61437908496732

1230739,4,B00000IXOC,"In contrast to the two star review, I didn't see it coming.  Of course, in retrospect, it all fit together, but that didn't make it predictable.  Good acting all around.  There is one particularly rough scene that makes you wonder what the movie is going to degenerate into, but it doesn't go there and the plot thickens, as they say.  I think it deserves four stars.",1366070400,,367,4.515151515151516
1230770,3,B00000IXOC,"Holden Downs (Nick Mancuso) is a real estate developer who is being sued and is under a lot of stress. He alienates his wife (Linda Hoffman). When he captures a man (Andrew Divoff) attempting to steal his Porsche, he takes it out on him.
At this point everyone in the movie hates Holden , so our sympathy lies with the thief. The thief also has a brother (Michael Mahonen) who enters the picture.

There really wasn't much torture except for one brief scene...unless you consider getting your arm caught in an electric window torture. There are far better abduction and capture films out there. Too much of the film takes place in a garage. And a twist? In an abduction film? I believe they all have the same one.

In some regards the thief's capture and torture symbolizes how the system has captured and tortured our poor millionaire developer. If you look on it as an art film, you can squeeze 3 stars.

1230772,5,B00000IXOC,"Throughout life, when you're a couple of avid B lovers, you will come across some really horrible movies and some really great unintentional comedies. Typically you will discover these movies between midnight and 4 pm. For some reason we have found these four hours to be crucial in stumbling upon B gold, which was the case 11 years ago. The brothers Sid were having a typical good old time on Saturday night when a great 90's B movie came on. The film was captivating in the most B way possible. The part when the car owners pegs the thief in the head with a wrench really won us over. However the next day we had no clue what the movie title was, and never found out until a luckily coincidence last night. While updating the movie query a suggestion was made that we may also enjoy ""Captured"". Immediately a light bulb went off saying this may be that hilarious movie watched so many years ago. And thankfully....she was.

Captured is centered around a real estate developer Holden Downs, and total nut case, who is on the brink of a nervous breakdown. He is attempting to develop his dream property but getting sued by a bunch of tree huggers while doing so. One evening while going to his car he discovers a couple thieves , on being the guy who played Wishmaster...awesome!, attempting to snatch his porsche. He winds up scaring them off then hires his young guido nephew to build a car that will trap any thief inside. You can see where this is going. Obviously Wishmaster breaks into Holden's car and becomes trapped inside for lots of mental torture. It's really quite awesome and hilarious. There are a lot of twists and turns with an actual well written plot for a 90's B. We were having trouble like it on a B or legitimate level....but naturally B level was decided as the clear winner.

Being a movie from our past, Captured had a lot to live up too based off the memory of it. It didn't disappoint, much like a chicken marsala slice from Pudgy's. Wow that sounds great right now. Captured fit into every possible required category for a B proving yet again why the 90's really had it going on. It's really incredible the amount of hilarious B one decade could produce, and they're all shown after midnight on any given night. Because of this you should always B ready because you never know when some fine B will come your way. Sometimes it's even by dumb luck like us with Death Ring. And just think if we never got to see the immortal Death Ring...things just wouldn't be the same.",1331337600,,2499,4.502202643171806
1230773,5,B00000IXOC,"Nick Mancuso and Andrew Divoff are two of my favorite actors.  I bought this movie on a lark because it was cheap and because of the stars, and I was not disappointed.  Nick Mancuso plays the role of a wealthy man who has come a bit unhinged, and takes his revenge on a hapless car thief.  The best part about this movie is how the director allows the extreme behavior to come to its logical conclusion, and allows the actors to behave as real people in this situation would.  Virtually an unknown movie but you will not be disappointed.",1310688000,,537,4.393939393939394
1230774,4,B00000IXOC,"One of the best Nick Mancuso performances I've seen. Crafty story, great acting, and entertaining to watch! This is a must for someone looking for a movie sit on the couch and enjoy.",1195257600,,182,4.545454545454546
1230775,2,B00000IXOC,"CAPTURED is a thriller which pits a development tycoon against a car thief.

Holden Downs (Nick Mancuso) is a developer who has his dream of building Millenium City halted due to a lawsuit by a conservation group. Two car thieves choose the wrong time to attempt a theft of Holden's car and he takes it out on one of them by breaking his arm. This act leaves a bad taste is the mouth of the older brother, Robert Breed (Andrew Divoff), who plans to steal the car for good. Meanwhile, Holden, who has not taken kindly to the threat, has the security system on the car updated to set a trap for the would be car thief. Robert acts on his plan to steal the car and end up as Holden's captive; pitting two captor and captive against each other with a downward spiral which presents a moral dilemma of going too far and at what point one went too far.

CAPTURED does a good job of maintaining its pace and giving Mancuso quite a bit of dialogue to deliver overzealously. As Divoff presents a balancing character, it is ashame that they did not give him as much with which he could work, leaving his character underdeveloped. Despite this, Divoff does give a good performance with what he has. The imbalance in the characters, even though Mancuso's character is the primary, takes away from the potential to sypathize with other than Mancuso's character, and that will disappear in short order.

What CAPTURED ends up presenting is a story about one man, who nobody cares about, and a thief, who nobody cares about, winding its way through a predictable series of events and an overdrawn ending which was obvious well before the movie got there.

Despite this, CAPTURED does maintain a good pace with Mancuso and Divoff working well off of each other. There are moments of tension which raise the film above its own predictability. CAPTURED is not a movie I would highly recommend, but, if you have nothing better to do, it will not bore. It frankly strikes me as a 95 minute episode of The Outer Limits with its moral dilemma and its twist ending.--Bob",1133568000,5,2047,4.569482288828338
1230776,5,B00000IXOC,"This movie was so good, all I can say is, ""wow."" One of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time. Peter Liapis who starred in Ghoulies and Ghoulies IV wrote and directed this movie. It was creepy and suspenseful.
Andrew Divoff stars in this movie as a petty thief who gets caught trying to steal a car owned by Holden Down (Nick Mancuso) and ends up trapped in the car.
During the middle/end of the movie, Andrew (Robert Breed) gets out and then things get really interesting. From the beginning to the end the movie kept up with the plot, and it never got boring.
I think in the beginning though, it is kind of hard to understand until you see Andrew's character and his Brother going after Holden's car, then it starts from there when Holden catches his Brother and breaks his arm. The acting was really good, Andrew Divoff was the best actor in this movie. I enjoyed his performance as well as Nick Mancusos.",1013212800,5,916,4.394117647058824

Well, Nick Mancuso IS IN CONTROL of your attention till the  very end. Add music, photography... An hour and a half very well spent!",963792000,5,362,4.3088235294117645
1230779,4,B00000IXOC,"Michael Mahonen is one of Canada's finest actors. I loved him when he played,""Lee Colagen"",on the CBS/Canadian mini-series, ""Conspiracy of Silence"". I also agreed with other people that he  role should have been more in-depth.  On ""Captured"", I feel as  though they wasted the talent of a good actor.  Is there a website for  Michael Mahonen; if so, please let me and the rest of his U.S. fans know  about it.  Thanks.",962064000,2,418,4.722222222222222
