Five Star is one of my fave UK 80's group of all time, and I love seeing all their videos - including ""All Fall Down"", ""Love Take Over"", 'Let Me Be The One"", ""Whenever You're Ready"" and more.",1362700800,,318,3.984375

8142113,5,B000HXDS40,"O.K. first your gonna need a multi or region-free dvd player to enjoy this dvd, which kinda does set limitations for many of us.  Which is a shame, because this dvd is a treasure to Five Star fans! this is nothing but a collection of 24 of the groups music videos spanning from humble beginnings in 1985 to 1991!  Many of these videos weren't even released in the states, as well as the video, thus ALL the treasures we are privliged enough to now not only view, but own these videos!  Such videos that are familiar in the states as: ""Can't Wait Another Minute"", ""All Fall Down"", & ""Let Me Be The One"".  Just to name a few, the treasures are songs and videos that offer us such hits/videos like: ""Another Weekend"", ""The Slightest Touch"", ""Rock My World"", ""With Every Heartbeat"", & ""Rain Or Shine"", all these songs plus several others included were only released in the UK. Dubbed ""The British Jacksons"" in the UK definitely speaks in volumes of what a loved group Five Star was and after seeing this ""Performance"" of videos you will love them as much as I do!
