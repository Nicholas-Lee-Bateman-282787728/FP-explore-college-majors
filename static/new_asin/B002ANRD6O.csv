8359941,5,B002ANRD6O,"My first experience of Michael Glickman came through several crop circle DVDs in which Glickman was not the featured player but rather one among numerous crop circle ""experts"" and aficianados. He DID stand out, though.  Always a figure of controversy, Glickman is bombastic, opinionated, and given to very well-tuned and articulate pontificating on the subject of crop circles. The bombastic side of Glickman is also evident in this series of DVD's, but we also see other aspects of Glickman's complex personality.

First all, what these DVD's ARE  . . . a series of lectures given over several years between the late 1990s and about 2005, most of them occurring at the annual crop circle fair held in Glastonbury, England.  Glickman does not just speak, but illustrates his points with copious slides and videos.  Occasionally, the main lecture is supplemented with brief videos inserted in order to illustrate or clarify one point or another.

In these videos, we see sides of Glickman that are not as apparent in the brief clips devoted to him in other crop circle videos.  The bombastic Glickman is still here, but so is the humorous Glickman, who can be very funny indeed.  But above all, we see the scholarly Glickman, the student of shape, geometry, and number.  And we see Glickman the Seeker, convinced that the circles convey a portentious message, but unwilling to declare with any specificity who the message is coming from.

Glickman, an architect by training, has delved into the geometric symbolism of the circles in a way that can be matched or exceeded by very few, if any.  But, despite his probings into the MEANING of the circles, he repeatedly states that what keeps him going is the MYSTERY of the circles, the way in which the circles provide fuel for speculation, for contemplation, and for discussion, for an afternoon with friends around the teapot or the wine decanter or the whisky flask.

Glickman is controversial in the crop circle community for maintaining his belief in the authenticity of far more circles than other luminaries such as Colin Andrews are prepared to give credit to.  On more than one occasion, this has led to public recriminations between Glickman, Andrews, and other researchers.  To be honest, Glickman sometimes speaks before he thinks, as do - I suppose - most of us.

But watching these DVDs, I can say that - despite his faults - Glickman comes across as a lovable man, a true ""character"" in a corporate, button-down world, and as a man of high intelligence and strong emotions.  Watching him unravel the geometric mysteries and intricacies of a crop circle is fascinating, and - at least to my mind - reinforces the suspicion that the the claims of human construction are overstated, or - if not overstated - decidedly UNDEREXPLAINED.

Perhaps the most elaborate crop circle of them all - the huge 409-circle spiral at Milk Hill in 2001 - has been claimed as their own by hoaxers. How do you create an intricate pattern of 409 circles in less than 360 minutes of darkness?  I don't think you can, and neither does Michael Glickman, who - as a professional architect - is fully aware of the time involved in laying out the groundwork for even a simple home addition, in broad daylight.  Perhaps, somewhere the hoaxers have convincingly shown how they did it, and I missed it. So, for some of us, despite the rising chorus of claims that ""they are all man-made,"" the mystery continues.

So break out the teapot or the wine decanter or the whisky flask, and watch and listen to a remarkable man talking about remarkable things in a remarkable way.  You won't regret it.",1344384000,3,3624,4.831715210355987
8359942,5,B002ANRD6O,"I love this set of DVDs! Michael Glickman is able to analyze the crop circles and show connections and design styles that I would never have picked up on. Listening to him is intriguing, informative, and FUN. What a great character and what a great mind.",1295136000,3,254,4.543478260869565
8359943,5,B002ANRD6O,"He talks about the geometry of the circles, of the circles relationship with the ancient landmarks and of the circles with each other.  I have seen books with drawings of geometrical shapes and not understood what is being discussed, but Glickman shows how he reached his conclusions step by step, so that someone that hasn't studied sacred geometry  can follow his thinking.  The lectures are well illustrated with photographs and drawings.  This series is worth every penny and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in the crop circles.",1251676800,5,544,5.078651685393258
