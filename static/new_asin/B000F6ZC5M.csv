8118457,3,B000F6ZC5M,"This documentary was well put together and accurate, but it fails to mention the the Armada of 1588 was but one battle in the Anglo-Spanish war that lasted from 1585 to 1604. This documentary fails to state the facts of that war such as the disaster the English suffered in 1589 when Drake and Norris  suffered a defeat of equal proportion in their fruitless attempt to destroy
the rest of the Spanish Navy in Northern Spain. This documentary also fails to mention that the Spanish Navy continued to dominate the seas after 1589 wining most of the naval clashes and eventually forcing King James I, Elizabeth's successor, to make peace with terms mostly favorable to Spain in 1604.",1208044800,3,681,4.771186440677966
