8163785,1,B000LR6FRO,Bad- real bad -the worse- rumors turned into sensational garbage. Low budget exploitation- the worse sort of fly by night nonsense. Avoid at all costs.,1376265600,2,151,5.08
8163786,1,B000LR6FRO,"this is yet another piece of junk from conspiracy journal.  see the other reviews for rental of this dvd.  vague, general, offering absolutely nothing to the viewer.  it mentions the books ""passover plot"" and ""holy blood, holy grail"" and has some generic photos we've all seen before.  like other videos from conspiracy journal, they alter the narrators voice for some dramatic effect that is a joke at best.  there is some no name psychic that embarrases herself with her ""gift"".  if you have any basic knowledge of ufos, conspiracy theory you'll find nothing new or entertaining here.",1374624000,2,586,4.989690721649485
8163787,5,B000LR6FRO,"There are a lot of strange mysteries surrounding the Church and Christianity. Does the Vatican hold secret records within its vaults that could cast a whole new spin on what is written in the Bible? Did Jesus die on the cross, or did he survive to have a family of his own to carry on the holy blood?  Does the Vatican have evidence that that UFOs are real and piloted by extraterrestrials? Is there a secret cabal of priests and Bishops that owe a unholy allegiance to the devil rather than Christ?  These are just a few of the fascinating topics covered in this well-made and thought provoking DVD. Watch it for yourself to open your eyes to things that you may have never considered about history, the Bible and the Church.",1192838400,5,726,4.492424242424242
8163788,5,B000LR6FRO,"The nature of religious faith has always included a certain amount of reaching for the unknown, and when that faith is institutionalized, as with the present day Vatican, those spiritual mysteries take on an ominous power that does not yield itself easily to investigation from the outside.

So it is a welcome delight to view this latest DVD documentary from Global Communications, called ""Secrets of the Vatican."" I am credited as being an Associate Producer on the film, and I wrote parts of the script as well as interviewed experts in the field, like Brad Steiger, Jordan Maxwell, Patricia Ress and Penny Melis. But even I was not prepared for what an excellent job fellow producer Tim Swartz did in putting the pieces together. Swartz combined countless relevant photos, classical paintings, background music and videotape shot on location at the Vatican into a wonderful whole that is definitely more than the sum of its parts.

One of the topics covered in the film is the Vatican's long and troubled history with demonic possession and the priests called on to perform exorcisms throughout the world. In our research, we even uncovered an incident in which the late Pope John Paul II, who was making a public appearance at Vatican City, was accosted by a possessed teenage girl. The young woman shouted obscenities at him and required several strong bodyguards to keep her restrained. The Pope spent about half an hour with the girl, trying to becalm her and bring her back to reason, but his efforts failed and she quickly lapsed back into her possessed state.

Meanwhile, the Vatican has begun a new program to train priests to be exorcists in response to the increased worldwide demand for the evil spirit cleansing service. Along with learning the ancient rites of exorcism, the priests are also taught some basic psychiatry so they can determine if the possessed are truly under the devil's control or are instead suffering something much more prosaic, like schizophrenia. The Vatican puts part of the blame for the rising number of requests for exorcism on an increased interest in Satanism and the occult, especially there in Western Europe.

But the material on possession is only a small part of ""Secrets of the Vatican."" There is also a wealth of information on the Vatican and its current interest in astronomy and Ufology. In fact, one Monsignor Balducci, highly placed in the Vatican elite, has been speaking openly on the subject of UFOs for many years, with the blessing of both the former and current popes. According to Balducci, the UFO phenomenon is not something demonic, and he looks forward to being one of the aliens' spokesmen when open contact is finally announced to the world.

Still more of the documentary tackles the thorny problem of rumors of Satanism at the highest levels of the Vatican, with priests and nuns willingly engaging in perverted sexual rites in service to their dark master. While none of this can be proved, of course, it is at least worth listening to the accusations leveled by Vatican insiders and others in the know. The old expression, ""Where there's smoke, there's fire,"" might be operative here.

Global Communications, the makers of ""Secrets of the Vatican,"" has just added a FREE bonus audio CD to the DVD package. The CD contains extensive interviews I conducted with those who contributed their knowledge to the project, including the aforementioned Brad Steiger, Penny Melis, Patricia Ress and Jordan Maxwell.

In any case, ""Secrets of the Vatican"" provides a solid hour of fascinating fact and conjecture, as well as being visually a delight to the eyes. While some of what is presented here may be a bit more ""out there"" than one is comfortable with, watching the engrossing stories unfold will keep you riveted to the screen as you ponder just how powerful the Vatican is on today's international conspiracy scene and what kind of secrets it really is keeping.",1165881600,5,3932,4.948484848484848
