8278492,5,B001APM41M,"This review is for Barracuda I have not seen The other film on this DVD called Island Fury.  Barracuda is a 1978 film about attacks on people by Barracuda in the ocean of a small town called Palm Cove.  The film starts out under water with a swimmer being attacked.  The scene reminds me very much of the movie Phirana.  With the fish tails wiggling as blood fills the water.  At the beginning I thought this was going to be a simple 1970's killer animal movie.  But after a few more attacks the film plot go's deeper than you would expect.  Spoiler Alert!  If you don't want to know why the Barracuda are attacking before seeing the film you can stop reading now.  It is soon discovered by a marine biologist that the Barracuda have chemicals in there blood, and that dumping of waste at the local chemical plant is to blame.  But the chemicals found in there blood are not industrial chemicals,so what are they doing in the waste that the plant is dumping into the ocean?  It is discovered by the marine biologist that an experiment is going on in the town called the Lucifer project Which involves putting chemicals in the towns water supply to cause low blood sugar in the people.  All with the help of the town doctor.  For the purpose of mind control and making people violent  during war.  Creating killer Barracuda was just an unexpected result of the Lucifer project.  The film is a lot of fun!",1403827200,2,1403,4.464566929133858
8278493,3,B001APM41M,"Barracuda (1978) I bought this movie because I really thought it would be terrible. I imagined something like ""Spawn of the Slithis"", or ""Nazi Surfers Must Die"", but this movie turns into a fun one after all. In the beginning, the plot is very silly - barracudas eat people. Amazing. The filming is under water, with the barracudas waving their tails while eating the limbs of people is laughable. But... in the middle of the movie the barracudas disappear, and the story, although still with poor acting, gets interesting. In fact, X-Files is very close to this in subject. And the end is a lot better than one you could expect from a movie called ""Barracuda"".

""Island Fury"" Please Don't Eat the Babies (1983) Hank Worden, Mose in ""The Searchers"", winds down a great career with this student film mish-mash of a movie. Yachters use Worden's small island pier/store to stock up on supplies. The island is off limits and there is a curfew for the paying customers. Yachters are supposed to drop a few bucks and push off. Any one breaking the rules discovers Worden has a family inland that bears more than a passing resemblance to the Texas Chainsaw Clan. Which would have been fine. The film gets even more inept trying to inject a monster menace. Aquatic cockroach things that Worden's family has a weird empathy with. This is a particularly inept and difficult film to watch.",1386115200,2,1378,4.741666666666666

8278495,1,B001APM41M,Ok here is how it goes this double feature was a double boredom.  It seemed to drag on and on and on.  You get my meaning  There was no action and if there was I missed it and Island fury should have been Island boredom. Most of the time you are confused between the flashbacks which I am still not sure why they were in there and what is going on in the present My advice run the other way before you waste your money.,1234310400,2,419,3.9058823529411764
