I bought the one (by mistake) that has no subtitles, but had seen it so many times on VCR that I know what's going on. When you watch the movie with subtitles, you forget very quickly that you're reading subtitles. The story is compelling and the characters are wonderful.
This movie is delightful!!!",1393891200,2,394,4.410958904109589

8133576,5,B000GNOFAM,"This film, titled in English ""The Glory of my Father"" is a dramatisation of part of Marcel Pagnol's childhood before the outbreak of World War One in 1914. The narrative is revealed through the lens of how a child sees the world to the backdrop of idealism, faith in the future and in scientific advancement personified by Marcel's father, a professional teacher, anti-cleric (the cause of much amusing confrontation) and optimist. The film is funny, charming, occasionally poignant and the characters are finely observed. It has a good script and is paced just right. The occasional voice-over by the now-adult narrator looking back to the events described decades earlier works well and reminds the viewer he is watching a real memoir, not fiction.

After a 45-minute run-through from Marcel's birth and infancy, the main action moves to one long, idyllic summer holiday taken by the extended family in a remote region of Provence where they rent an isolated house set in the stunning, wild landscape. Marcel's journey of discovery of the wild region and how to survive it in the company of Lili, a boy his own age, and his simultaneous idolization of his father, who he sees as the fount of all knowledge, makes for an absorbing and life-affirming viewing experience; though without the serious exploration of human nature and fateful consequence of actions explored in the ""Jean de Florette/Manon des Sources"" epic, this film has a lighter touch. The wild Provencal landscapes revealed through the cinematography though are every bit as stunning.

This film is good, if not ""great"". It's a fine observation of human nature seen through the eyes of a child, and of a time past where family bonds and close social community was everything experienced; pre-internet, pre-TV, pre-radio, where children ran free and the wide, dangerous  world was a distant thing rarely travelled or experienced by most. These innocent days were shattered by the First World War, after which nothing would ever be the same.

This would be a good date movie, curled up on the couch with a bottle of wine. The subtitling is pretty much true to the original (as an example, the cartman's line probably never heard in any other film ""Being blind and wearing sunglasses would be like looking up a mole's arse"" is a literal translation of the line spoken in French). If you like European cinema, or this type of richly textured, witty, non-sentimental but life-affirming movie French cinema seems to be so good at, then you'll like this film and will probably watch it more than once.",1288828800,8,2560,4.96037296037296
