8243151,3,B0011ZJ5HC,"This DVD would be pretty good for someone starting in woodworking. For me, it's more of a rehash but I did learn one or two things, just not enough. You can't seat through the whole video without intervention from the remote control every few minutes as you are required to select the next chapter manually every time, seems like too chopped up. Additionally, too many commercial links to various sponsored web sites that I didn't need. For now I'm getting more out of the free woodworking podcasts over the internet.",1241740800,3,517,4.7555555555555555
8243152,5,B0011ZJ5HC,"This DVD was extremely helpful to me. Mr. Blackburn's editing and interviews, not to mention his cinematography, got me right inside the methodologies the series tries to impart. I recommend this quarterly video journal to anyone who is serious about learning new woodworking skills.",1209513600,,283,5.454545454545454
8243153,5,B0011ZJ5HC,"This is the second Woodworking in Action DVD I've viewed (I did not begin in order and am working my way back) and I'm not disappointed.
Graham Blackburn  presents his guests doing and showing us their best with informative humor and charm.
These are not ordinary  videos.  If there is a film festival for woodworking videos, these would win all awards!!!
Again, I learned a lot and will definitely subscribe.",1208217600,2,409,4.814285714285714

8243156,5,B0011ZJ5HC,"I bought this video magazine as a gift for a friend and now I am going to have to buy another because I don't want to give it away! This is the best woodworking how-to I have come across. It is setup like a real magazine -
each video ""article"" is by one of the real stars of woodworking and it's just like being invited into their homes and workshops and looking over their shoulder while they work. In fact, it's even better because they explain in detail how they do what they do with close-ups and clear angles so you can see their technique and all the tiny details that make the difference between a so-so project and one that turns out to be a work of art.  A big plus-- Graham Blackburn, the host, himself an expert and insider who seems to know how to ask the right questions to make things really clear (and entertaining). Production values are very professional and the accompanying music is terrific.  I plan to buy the whole series.",1202774400,3,944,4.357954545454546
8243157,5,B0011ZJ5HC,"What a great idea!  Seeing new woodworking products, demonstrations and craftsmen interviews on video makes all the difference.  Looking forward to future issues...",1199750400,4,164,6.086956521739131
