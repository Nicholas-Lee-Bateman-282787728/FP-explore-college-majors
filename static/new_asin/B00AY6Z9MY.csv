8559107,3,B00AY6Z9MY,"Note that this is in BlueRay format, although box says DVD discs.  To say the very least, I could not play this on the big TV while seating comfortable on my sofa.  Fortunately it works on my Mac, so it wasn't a total loss.  Note that discs seem to be cheaply copied.  I cannot tell which episode I'm currently watching unless I go back to credits at beginning of episode.  Cannot skip to next episode; have to go to main menu. Ratings based solely on cheap packaging and copies.  The series is a classic.",1421107200,3,505,4.319148936170213
8559108,4,B00AY6Z9MY,"I have watched this online -- but I wish to buy the DVD as my collection, this is the best maken of Return of the Condor Heroes, could you ship to Canada?",1402444800,,154,3.84375
