8634169,5,B00HQ6858K,"I love the first Demons movie, and I snapped this Bluray as soon as I could.
There are tons of cool extras like trailers and behind the scenes, but the best extra(in my opinion),
is a replica of the movie ticket that one of the main characters receives.  It's printed on really good
quality paper, and on the back has some behind the scenes info on this BluRay release.
Synapse did a great job on this obscure Italian horror film.  :)",1449100800,,434,4.345679012345679

I'm gonna try and explain why this Steelbook is a Complete Joke
I've been Collecting Steelbooks off and on for little over 4years
Of all the Steelbooks I've bought Synapse Films's SB of Demons is the Biggest waste of my hard earned money Ever

I'll back track in 2012 UK's Arrow Video released Demons & Demons II on Remastered Collector's Editions BR's
Keep in mind around this time ALL Arrow videos were Region Free Disc
I pre-ordered Both Demons & Demons II and even Exclusive Limited Edition Demons 1&2 Steelbook w/Both Films in a Slick Steelbook from Amazon.uk.com  (at the time these Films were Region Free Then something fishy went down and these Releases were Region-Locked
Due to some back-room deal Synapse made w/Arrow Video
Here's why this BR Steelbook is a massive Joke
Synapse Films did NOTHING
Arrow Video did all the heavy lifting they Remastered and created Arrow Exclusives
Then Synapse bought the License/Rights to Distribute Arrows Version in the States
I find it sad that Collectors love to Blast Twilight Times for there Shady Practices But, Synapse gets this pass!
Why???
I payed $40.00 for this Steelbook Direct from Synapse.com + $5.00S&h  =$45.00 for A Carbon Copy Arrow did
I payed around $30.00 US for the Limited Edition of Demons Steelbook (That has BOTH Films and all the Exclusive Extras)
All Horror Fans/Collectors Do your research Don't buy into this Massive Hype $90+ Dollars for this
The Steelbook itself is Stunning But, All the Data on the disc is Not Exclusives
Think with your wallet Not your OCD
P.S. Anyone selling this Steelbook for the Crazy asking price is Shameless
I uploaded a Pic Comparing Both Steelbooks from the UK and here in the States",1429833600,14,1760,4.801980198019802
