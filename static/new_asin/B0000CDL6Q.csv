7999080,5,B0000CDL6Q,My husband and I talk often about the old western shows we watched when we were kids.  It was real good to watch this CD.  We received it on time and the the CD is clear and easy to watch.,1168473600,3,188,3.675
7999081,2,B0000CDL6Q,"I understand that these are very old shows and, no doubt, were not preserved well, but I think that this should be pointed out in your advertising. It is disappointing when you expect the same quality that you remember and the picture is distorted, faded (almost bleached) and has poor sound. If this is acknowledged first, it would minimize the quality expectations. Old fans would still purchase the product.

7999082,4,B0000CDL6Q,"Wow...Excellent Quality and content.. I truely enjoyed this. I one have given it a 5 star rating if it had included, Lawman, Yancy Deringer, Colt 45 or Wanted Dead or Alive...

It did however include Sugarfoot, Jim Bowie, Kit Carson and Annie Oakley which I haven't seen in years.. Secondly how can you beat good old black & white television. If you were born circa 1953 as I was this is a ""MUST""... I showed this to my father who was born in 1924 and I have never seen him happier...",1153526400,10,484,4.318681318681318
7999083,5,B0000CDL6Q,"if you have read any of my reviews you know i love westerns,and you should know that i really like this great collection of some of t.v. early westerns.

  bcieclipise is a company that i have come to like very much. they started this trend of putting movies and shows into a 5 or 10 disc set. most of their sets are very good and have nice if not great transfers.

  this set of old t.v. westerns is a fine cross section of some old westerns, some i had never heard of, but all of them are pretty good. i don't have a break down of all the shows for you but if you like westerns like me i think this is one collection you may want to have.they are all kid friendly and my boys watch these old shows with me and we have a ball. that alone puts this set high on my list of dvd's to have.",1145491200,15,786,3.88125
