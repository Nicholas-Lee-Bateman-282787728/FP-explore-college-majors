7803943,3,6300137988,"This was a great little project by TFT--it's the same theme as J-MEN FOREVER-that is, overdubbing voices and music onto existing 1940s films; the great thing about this is, it is several short films divided into different storylines. As usual, there's the razorsharp wit we know and love from these guys as well as the dynamic writing we've come to expect. Face-paced and absolutely hilarious, it appears the only way you may ever get to see this rarity is by snatching up one of these VHS copies. Due to a potentially costly battle over copyrights, I really don't see a DVD version of this popping up anytime soon in the forseeable future.",1346457600,,640,4.723214285714286
7803944,5,6300137988,"Sometimes the Firesign Theatre got sloppy and the laughs were few and far between.  But when they're good, they're REAL good.  This video has a bunch of short b&w films they dubbed over to highjack the storyline, and some of the results are really kind of twisted.  ""Sperm-Bank Holdup"" and ""The Last Handgun on Earth"" should give you an idea of what you're in for.  Think MST3K.",1044144000,3,378,4.597014925373134
7803945,5,6300137988,"In the world of the Firesign,this is much like ""J-Men Forever!!"" With the added attraction of Phil Austin, it only made me wish that David Ossman had contributed his writing superb dribble. Hopefully,this one will be re-released on DVD,along with Martian Space Party. Until then,meet you under the stands at Morse Science!!",1042934400,2,323,5.230769230769231
7803946,4,6300137988,"How can you top a classic like ""High School Madness""? Frankly, you can't, but once the little guys were able to finish the mural at More Science High, if they hadn't fallen straight through a hole to the center of The Earth, perhaps they would have received recognition for Excellence In Hollywood. This is a weird tape, sort of Firesign Meets MST3K. I like it nearly as much as Amazon Women On The Moon, & I'm sure it will keep Grandma & Grandpa occupied for hours, just trying to figure how to get the case open. No one concerned with Shoes For Industry should miss this, except possibly Imelda Marcos. Papoon for President!",1028937600,2,626,4.548672566371682
