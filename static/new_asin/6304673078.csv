905232,4,6304673078,"Charlie Rodgers (Elvis Presley) is a coffee shop singer. As the movie opens, he is fired after a short fight is picked. Film after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, after film, and did I mention after film, we see Elvis Presley's characters fighting.
But yet, that is all what we see Elvis Presley doing singing and fighting. But yet if he has a job he almost aways loses his jobs. Charlie is hired by Maggie Morgan to be her carnvial's Roustabout. Yet we never see him in another sport film besides racing. Whether in cars or in boats.
And for the time he meets a lot of female characters in films. And maybe even fight for the women. But why would Charlie Rodgers get a job as a Roustabout? In yet, Elvis almost aways finds a way out of fights, even if it lands him in jail and costs his job.
But yet are we supposed to be happy for Elvis Presley's chacters. Even if we don't find it in our hearts to be happy for his characters. And have other people like his he is a father or mother or both bail him out instead of sending him in jail for a time in jail. Like a couple of months or weeks or years.
Doesn't Elvis Presley get tired of playing characters that get into this sticky mess. Charlie has a motor bike but gets broken and stays at a carnival until it is fixed.",997574400,,1316,4.18503937007874
905233,5,6304673078,"In one of his best movies, Elvis Presley plays a handsome, bonafide jerk who, on route to his next job, accidentally encounters Barbara Stanwyck, her even jerkier husband, and her beautiful step-daughter (Joan Freeman).  Maggie (Stanwyck) decides to let Elvis become her dying carnival's  roustabout, but he does more. When Elvis sings, well, you know what  happens! The carnival begins to attract attention and the money starts  rolling in. But when Elvis is offered a bigger salary by another carnie, he  is torn between the prospects of a better life and his loyalty to Stanwyck,  and particularly, her step-daughter. Every song in the film is ""a  wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful"" experience. Elvis's fun  rockin' with ""Poision Ivy League"" to his romantic wooing of  Freeman in a ferris wheel, to the upbeat ""It's Carnival Time"" the  big production number, ""Little Egypt"", and the final, memorable  number, ""And The Whole World's Gonna Be Mine"". And Stanwyck is  just great as the good-hearted carnie whom Elvis learns to trust. You'll  have fun with this movie or buy it for the Elvis fan in your family...  ""be a big shot for a dollar, it's Carnival Time!""",958608000,12,1172,5.036458333333333
905234,5,6304673078,"Since ""Roustabout"" debuted in 1965, I've become an expert on it. The cast includes a screen legend as well as recognizable supporting actors. Besides Barbara Stanwyck, there is Pat Buttrum, Sue Ann Langdon,  and Norman Grabowski as the cement-headed college student who tries to muss  Elvis's hair. Joan Freeman is Elvis' romantic interest. She later  co-starred with Don Knotts in ""The Reluctant Astronaut"". Imagine  kissing Elvis in one movie and Don Knotts another. Well, I guess that's why  they call it ""acting"". As for the story, it revolves around Elvis  as a temporary carnival worker while aiming for the BIG time. There is a  fistfight with Elvis nemesis Steve Brodie, Elvis riding his  ""bike"", Elvis as the saviour of the carnival, and Elvis with a  new girlfriend. What more could you ask for? If you can think for yourself,  and not be  content with ""Blue Hawaii"" as your favorite, then  check out ""Roustabout"". It's more fun than a circus, ""cheap  at half the price"" AND, you won't have to ""bite any heads off  chickens"".",950918400,2,1035,4.873563218390805
905235,3,6304673078,"""Roustabout"" (1964) is a better-than-average Elvis Presley musical with the added bonus of Barbara Stanwyck in one of her last films. It's nice to see Elvis play an unsympathetic character for a change. Despite the upbeat ending, he's still a jerk and it's great when Stanwyck yells at him. The soundtrack is mostly forgettable but it includes one classic song, ""Little Egypt."" As always, there are a few Elvis fight scenes to keep things lively. Overall, ""Roustabout"" represents the last decent Presley vehicle before his downhill journey into schlock.",937180800,4,553,5.224719101123595

905990,2,6304673078,"As far as I can discern, the only reason anyone would buy ""Roustabout"" or ""Easy Come Easy Go"", etc. is to see Elvis perform the admittedly weak songs.
In lieu of anything else in the films, singing is all there is to enjoy; I'd hazard to guess 99.99% of viewers aren't expecting an engrossing story.
So how does Paramount treat the folks who would buy these musicals? Pretty poorly. There's zero extras (some of their Presley releases don't even include the trailers) and, worst of all, many of them don't even have chapter access to the SONGS. Like this one. You read right.

905993,3,6304673078,"Although rather formulaic, Roustabout is one of Elvis' better outings. I really love this film.  I have to disagree with the reviewer who thinks the songs were forgettable.  I found them quite memorable and witty.  Example: Poison Ivy League, boys in that Ivy League, give me an itch -- those ""sons of the rich.""  Granted, the song needs to be understood within the context of the movie, but for a 1964 Elvis film that's rather tongue in cheek!  Roustabout -- ""I'm just a Roustabout, drifting from town to town, no job can hold me down...""  It's a great number that really introduces us to Elvis' free-wheeling character (a set up for the movie plot)  And of course who can forget ""Little Eva.""  Little Eva came out struttin wearin nuttin but a button and bow... It's an early popular 50s tune that meshed within the Carny atmosphere of the film.  And even It's Carnival Time although very simplistic is a catchy little tune.  Stanwyck is great and so is Leif Ericson, playing a doubting dolting father-type, although I just don't know how Elvis can punch him out one minute and then suddenly they're pals the next (but that's formula). Look it's fun, the tunes are peppy, he gets the girl what more can you get outta of an Elvis 60s movie!",1146614400,4,1240,4.595454545454546

906136,3,6304673078,Elvis is the bad boy turned good. He clearly irritates others by his behavior on the road. That is until gets sucked into the life of a carnival. The language lesson on terms used in the carnival makes an interesting background. His presence as a performer turns the fortune of the carnival around. What comes through is that carnivals are fun.,1126137600,,344,4.655737704918033
906137,4,6304673078,"This movie would never win an oscar, so my 4 & 1/2 stars is not based on any criteria like that. What I base my 4 & 1/2 stars on is the ""likeability"" factor. You and I both know that people who are not fans of Elvis would probably never watch or buy this film (or any of Elvis' movies for that matter). Therefore, most of the people who would potentially buy this film are either casual fans or die-hard fans of Elvis. Let's face it, this movie, (and all the Elvis movies) were made for and all about Elvis. That was the whole point! When watching this movie it is almost like watching a long music video of Elvis. Sure, there is some dialogue, and there is a bit of a story line, but the real point about watching this movie is to see the king of rock and roll, Elvis Presley.

I have many of the movies that Elvis made and I enjoy them all. I do however, take the story lines with a grain of salt. So long a one realizes that these movies were never meant to be on the same caliber as let's say, Casablanca, then the viewer can enjoy the film exactly for what it is and was meant to be... entertainment. Afterall, Elvis was a consummate entertainer. That is what he did on stage and that is what he did here in this film. Some of Elvis' other films had better songs, but this film is enjoyable nontheless.

906139,5,6304673078,"John Rich later became a TV titan and directed many of the best episodes of the best TV series, as well as taking a hand at production.  But his feature film career is even more interesting.  Like many journeyman directors, he was assigned a brace of Elvis pictures--this one and the later, hippie-themed EASY COME, EASY GO.  But he was also responsible for some of the most under-rated programmers of the 1960s, including THE NEW INTERNS and BOEING BOEING--and WIVES AND LOVERS as well.  In ROUSTABOUT he demonstrates a flair for working with actors of all stripes, from the legendary Golden Age star represented here by Barbara Stanwyck, to the neophyte starlet--in ROUSTABOUT there are plenty of them, and the most sparkling is a very young Raquel Welch, who makes her film debut in the opening scene as a college coed mesmerized by Elvis' singing.  Raquel looks great and seems quite believable.  It's no wonder her fi;lm career soared after making this film.  As Elvis' leading lady, Joan Freeman is pretty good, and for this we can thank John Rich, he brings out colors in her otherwise cut and paste performance that we would not see again in Ms. Freeman's acting until her amusing later turn as ""Ellie Jackson"" in the Don Knotts goof-fest THE RELUCTANT ASTRONAUT.

As for Barbara Stanwyck, what can you say?  She's great in the part and, even though at the time people say she was slumming by taking a supporting role in an Elvis picture, in hindsight she was pretty wise, for she was able to keep her name above the title and in Hollywood, that's all that matters.  She was one star who was able to keep working until the day she died.  As Maggie in ROUSTABOUT she adds new luster to the word, ""Termagant.""  She's bitter, she's fiery, she's curt, she's passionate and she's salty.  She's seen it all and laid down the law to bigger men than Elvis.  And yet at the end of the day, when all is said and done, she needs him to maintain her autonomy over her grand little carnival.  The two of them strike sparks together and their scenes have some of the resonance, at any rate, that Elvis brought to scenes with older women who reminded him of Gladys, his own late mother whom he adored.",1100476800,9,2194,4.589743589743589

This is not some lame rear projection process and most of the time the entire bike is shown, so it's not being towed - I just found it amazing, no kidding.  I mean, what if he lost his concentration...boom! Brain damage.
Oh and Leif Erickson will make you really uncomfortable in this movie - what a loser slime.",1074556800,5,635,4.456896551724138
906141,5,6304673078,"""Roustabout"" has Elvis playing a karate-chopping, drifting motorcyclist who is picked up after an accident involving him being knocked off his bike by local carnival foreman Leif Erikson, with his daughter Joan Freeman and owner Barbara Stanwyck. After his bike and guitar are damaged, he is hired by Stanwyck to work as a roustabout in her carnival. Elvis, of course, soon falls for Joan Freeman who is a little reluctant at first. Over time the carnival becomes the local night spot around as Elvis attracts people for singing along the midway. In come the teenagers and crowds in droves. Rival carnivla owner Pat Buttram asks if Elvis is interested in joining his big carnival. He refuses. After some confrontation involving a stolen wallet Erikson is convicted of and Joan Freeman's unhappiness with Elvis, he quits Stanwyck's outfit. Then it's off to the Carver show. Elvis is a hit. Back at the other carnival, business is failing and troubles with the bank build. Joan Freeman tries to bring him back, but to no avail at first. Later Elvis decides to go back, pay off the debt, win Joan Freeman, and make the carnival a swinging place again. Quintessential!",1036800000,9,1164,4.913705583756345
906142,3,6304673078,"Elvis plays opposite Barbara Stanwyke (The Big Valley) this time out and is in awe of his co-star. It is reported he worked hard on this film to live up to Ms. Stanwyke's professional standards.
Unfortunately, the scriptwriters were less demanding of themselves, and the film suffers from banal dialogue and predictable plotting. Elvis stars as Charlie Rogers, a drifter  with a chip on his shoulder who lands a job as a roustabout (handyman) with a down-and-out carnival operated by strong-willed Maggie Morgan, played by Stanwyke. When Charlie breaks into song on the midway one day, throngs of young people flock to hear him sing (which may be believable were they all penned by Lieber & Stoller). As news of his talent spreads, Maggie's carnival begins to turn a tidy profit. Charlie's good fortune continues as Cathy, a young and pretty carnival worker played by Joan Freeman, takes a romantic interest in him. However, after a misunderstanding involving a customer's missing wallet, Maggie and Cathy chide Charlie for his selfish attitudes. The embittered young Charlie quits Maggie's outfit to work for a rival carnival. When Maggie's carnival starts to go under, Charlie returns with enough money to ward off the creditors. His unselfish act wins Maggie's respect as well as Cathy's heart.
With a cast of big-name stars, including Barbara Stanwyke, Leif Erickson, and Jack Albertson, Roustabout was one of Elvis's better films from this period.
Elvis would later says that working with Stanwyke made him a better actor.",1028332800,6,1527,5.132530120481928
906143,3,6304673078,"Pleasant enough Elvis time-killer with a cotton candy soundtrack, pairing him with Hollywood veterans who should have known better. The story:
Elvis plays Charlie Rogers, a brooding loner (you can tell by his semi-comatose expression) eking out a living doing a bad impression of, well, himself at a dive called Mother's Tea House. (Look fast for Raquel Welch at one of the tables.) One night, he unwisely taunts some middle-aged college boys with a witty ditty called ""Poison Ivy League,"" gets in a fight, loses his job and sputters off on his dinky motorbike. Happening upon a jeep, Charlie is run off the road by short-fused carny Joe Lean (Leif Erickson) for flirting with his virginal daughter Cathy (Joan Freeman, who, tellingly, later became a nun). Unhurt, Charlie signs on as a roustabout in their two-bit carnival, run by Barbara Stanwyck as Maggie Morgan, a woman of backbone and bite (sorry, wrong show), until his bike can be repaired. Maggie recognizes Charlie's teen appeal after his impromptu performance of ""It's Carnival Time"" causes a sensation on the midway. Soon Charlie is packin' 'em in, and the carnival begins to turn a profit. On top of the world, Charlie steps up his romancing of Cathy while fending off the advances of an amorous fortune teller (the usually fetching Sue Ane Langdon in a hideous black wig) until a fracas with a boorish customer causes him to get ants in his pants again. His cycle fixed, Charlie dons his outrageously tacky, must-be-compensating-for-something, foot-wide studded-leather belt and accepts the generous offer of the owner (Pat Buttram, the immortal flimflam man Mr. Haney from TV's ""Green Acres"") of a big-time rival carnival. In the flick's most excruciating sequence, Charlie sings ""Little Egypt"" to a bevy of skanky exotic dancers (one of whom might be Teri Garr). Meanwhile, with Charlie no longer there to pull in the crowds, Maggie's carnival is about to go belly up, and it's up to Cathy to lure him back. She does, of course. Charlie collects his loot from Mr. Haney and returns to Maggie's show just in time to pay off her creditors. Suddenly everybody loves Charlie, his macho belt and his money, even Joe, who forgets all about protecting his daughter's chastity and his former habit of beating the stuffing out of Charlie for no good reason. Roll credits. Please.",1019174400,6,2336,4.961734693877551
906144,3,6304673078,"This Elvis flick leans to the dramatic. Not great drama, mind you, but more serious than the usual EP Grade B frolic. By 1964, Elvis was getting too old to be convincing as an ""angry young man,"" but he gave it his best shot. Elvis is the motorbike-riding rebel whose singing peps up business at a struggling carnival. Elvis clashes with the hard-drinking ramrod, Joe (Leif Erickson). Joan Freeman and Elvis moon around each other, but find romance a rocky road. Movie veteran Barbara Stanwyck lends stature to the film as the carnival owner. The song writing teams of Giant-Baum-Kaye and Leiber-Stoller wrote some of the music, but the results are only mixed. On the plus side, the ballad ""Big Love, Big Heartache"" and the comic ""Little Egypt"" number are worth the effort of viewing. The other music is less memorable. One amusing footnote is Pat Buttram as a rival carnival owner. This was shortly before he enjoyed popular recogniton as Mr. Haney on TV's ""Green Acres."" Given the movie's emphasis on the social mores of carnival folks, we wonder if Col. Tom Parker was in hog heaven, considering his carny background. The movie offers good Hal Wallis production values. Wallis once asserted he made flicks like this one to raise money for serious films like ""Becket."" He considered Elvis trivial but profitable. Elvis fans will be pleased with this movie, regardless. Sample the cotton candy fluff. ;-)",1010448000,8,1404,4.9033613445378155
906145,4,6304673078,"..and I mean this in a good way.
I am not that big of an Elvis fan really and never paid much attention to his films.  Every now and again, I would catch one late at night and giggle a bit but be incredibly bored after about 5 mins.
This one however is different!  I was told by a friend of mine (an avid, if not rabid Elvis fan) that I had to see this.  She called me late one night and told me it was on so I figured, what the hell? I ADORED it!
The plot is ridiculous. It seems Elvis, our misunderstood biker/bad boy hero has his motorcycle almost destroyed by a small family run carnival owner who graciously has the bike fixed...but it will take some time.  To make some spare travelin' cash..Elvis decides after much prodding to work at this carvial as a barker of sorts.  The business is not going well and an EVIL carnival conglomorate wants to take it over (seriously, how silly is that?). Of course the plot thickens, carny daughter falls in love with bad boy Elvis, bad boy gets accused of making trouble (stealing a wallet..my word!), bad boy leaves for the big lights of a larger carnival but is wooed back by beautiful headstrong girl and of course because when all is said and done, Elvis does have a heart of gold!  One of the best scenes is Elvis riding a motorcycle in a giant barrel, around and around and around...hilarious!
The entire film is goofy but in a real good kitch sort of way.  The thing that makes this movie is of course, Elvis and his singing.  I have never heard such silly songs...""It's Carnival Time"" and ""Little Egypt"" will leave you holding your sides, particularly with the ""dance"" numbers!  ""Big Love, Big Heartache"" is actually a very good song, I would have to say one of my top 5 favourite Elvis songs.
This film is good fun and the best part is, he really doesn't sweat all that much (have you noticed that in all the Hawaii films, it looks like a hose has been turned on him?).",1005436800,,1923,4.304709141274238
