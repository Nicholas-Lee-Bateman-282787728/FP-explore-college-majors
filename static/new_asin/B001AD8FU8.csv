The movie begins at a cantina where a woman dances. A stranger enters and asks about Bert Logan. Two men ask the sheriff to put an end to the Night Rider. This robber steals a cashbox from a ranch house. A telephone warns the Sheriff, he raises a posse from the tavern. The Night Rider shoots a man who recognized him and escapes to his hideout in a cave. ""Something must be done."" The Rogers ranch needs a new foreman. [Was there a clue here?] A tourist rides in the country, he is from Altoona Pennsylvania. Manuel follows him. The stranger meets them. They agree to join in the hunt for the Night Rider. Barton formed a Vigilante Committee (a local militia). There is a conflict in the tavern. The sheriff arrests John as ""Jim Blake"". Barbara Rogers want to hire Jim Blake as the new foreman. Barton received an unsigned note, Blake is able to get and read it. An explosion from the bank? Who robbed it? The posse follows when a witness tells which way he went. Blake follows the Night Rider to the Rogers' home. ""He got away.""

Blake and Barbara ride around, they stop at the old abandoned Rogers' mine. An explosion ended its working. Blake investigates and finds a hidden entrance, then a secret passageway to the Rogers' home. Ray Jones accused Blake of being the Night Rider, the note given to Barton offers proof. But the sheriff knows the true identity of Blake and trusts him. Blake has a scheme to trap the guilty, a forged message for Barton. There will be a meeting at the Rogers' ranch at midnight. Blake's men follow his orders, as does Barton. This play acting has a purpose, it will reveal the guilty! The sheriff arrests Barton and his men. Blake follows the Night Rider and captures him. Was the crime inspired by reading crime magazines? [A slam at competitive entertainment?] We hear more about Blake and Altoona, a relative of the Rogers family. Blake is offered a permanent job at the Rogers ranch. This promises a happy ending.

This story has the themes of the classic Western movie. A prominent man who is the secret head of a gang, a man wrongfully accused who clears himself by finding the real villains, etc. It is a good story but seems a little too contrived. I got the clue early in the movie, the killing of a man who recognized the mysterious masked man.",1290816000,,2317,4.511904761904762
