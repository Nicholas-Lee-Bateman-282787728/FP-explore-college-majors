Two performances stand out; 1) Joss Stone performing ""In between the heartaches"" and 2) Shaun Escoffery performing ""A house is not a home"". I belive I played Joss Stone 10 - 15 times the first week I had it!!! Audio and Video superb!!",1463443200,,276,4.431372549019608

7596962,4,B01AALT0M2,"This nearly two-hour (actually 11 minute) video (I viewed the Bluray) captures a tribute concert held at Londons Royal Festival Hall in 2015 honoring the music of Burt Bacharach. It originally aired on the BBC in the UK and is now on DVD from Eagle Rock Entertainment.

It was more than a concert, since  between the musical performances  Bacharach (sitting in a section to the left side of the stage, with interviewer Michael Grade) answers questions about his life and career. These may be interesting the first time through, but might better have been done as a bonus feature) so the BD/DVD could be replayed.

US viewers will know virtually all the songs but  not (most of) the performers. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about pop music but singers Joss Stone and Michael Kiwanuka were only ones I knrew before (and even they are not household names. The performers are good however.
The BD/DVD includes three songs not included in what was probably a 90 minute TV presentation, as bonus tracks.
There is a color 8-page booklet included which has little more than photos and song and production credits.

If you are a fan of Bacharach, youll enjoy this  I did, but its really something youll watch only once.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8746864,5,B01AALT0M2,"Sitting on the shelf behind Burt Bacharach as he answers questions by the interviewer (Michael Grade) at Royal Festival Hall in London (2015) is a framed photo of the legendary singer Dionne Warwick. Dionne owns the majority of the songs performed at this tribute concert to honor the song writer, Mr. Bacharach.

The concert opens with Rebecca Ferguson performing Walk on by. As good as she is as a singer Ferguson does not (in my opinion) match Dionne on this number. Her next performance singing I say a little prayer, made famous by Aretha Franklin, is much better. The rest of the performances that follow are similarly good.

The best thing about a recent tribute concert such as this one is that often it is recorded with much better audio/video technology than concerts of earlier years (when the original artists were in their prime) and that makes this disk well worth buying. The concert orchestra on stage is flawless. This blue ray concert disk is a must have for the baby boomer generation. Five solid stars!",1471824000,2,1022,4.801136363636363
