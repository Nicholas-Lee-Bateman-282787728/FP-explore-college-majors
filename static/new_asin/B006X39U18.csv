8506105,2,B006X39U18,"The description for this film says ""High definition Blu-ray and Yosemite are made for each other!"" I would agree, but this film is NOT high definition. Either a lot of people are easily pleased or my set is in some way defective. I played both disks in the set on my Blu-Ray player on my Samsung 40"" 1080p HD TV and both looked anything but HD. Very disappointing! I just came back from Yosemite, and my iPhone took better footage of Yosemite peaks than what I'm seeing here. I can only hope the set was perhaps burned incorrectly. I am contacting the seller for return.",1473638400,,570,4.438095238095238
8506106,5,B006X39U18,"Absolutley the best production and quality of any videos of this type on the market hands down. I have many of this type of videos in my collection. Im kind
of a collector when it comes to high def blu ray nature videos. Im an outdoorsman and a photographer as a serious hobby. I plan on getting many more of these
not just as a collector but because they are excellent and enjoyable to watch. The one on glacier national park as well as yosemite are mind boggling. You
wont be dissapointed.",1395705600,2,491,4.3478260869565215
8506107,5,B006X39U18,"Am in complete agreement with G. Pearson here and with the person who wrote the one review for the 2-DVD Combo version of this documentary film + extras. I just wish that Amazon would let us know more easily when a blu-ray version of an offering is available.

  I bought my blu-ray copy at the Ansel Adams Gallery in late May, so I knew it should be findable here when I wanted to get a copy for someone else.
  At the gallery, I had a chance to view it on a good monitor before buying it, so it was not a gamble.  When I played it at home, it was even better.

  The video fidelity is extraordinary; scenes of Merced River are so well produced that I feel as if I could jump in and take a swim.  The background audio (birds singing, bears walking slowly and heavily, beautifully matched high-quality music accompanying the visuals) is the best I've heard so far, having watched several on Netflix or Amazon's Prime and rentals.  It spoils you for some of the other ones that are photographed nicely enough but there is a chasm when it comes to smoothness of camera focus, movement, and perspective, and one thing that disappoints me in other videos I've seen is having to view really bad color values relative to the Discovering Yosemite Blu-ray edition.

  The main film is only about 38 minutes, but I've watched it several times or just had it on, because the visuals and accompanying sounds are so excellently done the film is just an immediate upper (this may sound shallow but it has that effect on me).

  The extras are fun and also informative about all the things you can enjoy in the park with more detail on some of what you see in the main film, but the main piece alone is worth the money for me.

  Hadn't been to Yosemite in decades but went in the Fall with a photo group, then back there in March and again in late May and I admit to an unexpected addiction to the place now.  It's hard to imagine this kind of beauty readily available so close to noisy city life, but I've found it a real boon.  John Muir wrote, in the early 1900's:

 ""Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out going to the mountains is going home; that wilderness is a necessity...""

  The film does give you a good idea why people feel this way once they've been there and then find themselves returning whenever life allows. I'm a city girl, but that's how I feel there too.  Caveat: I would not feel that way on weekends when it's very crowded there, or in the summer, as loud  crowds can be distracting from the basic calming effect of the spaces, mountain formations, waterfalls, and the river that runs through it.

  So, I've been really pleased to find such an excellent video that can make me feel as if I'm there when I'm not :-).  It's also informative, but not overly-detailed.  I would love it if they'd do a follow-up film on Yosemite.",1340496000,3,2879,4.4209523809523805
8506108,5,B006X39U18,"The Finley Holiday company produce very interesting DVD's mostly on America's National Parks and I think they do them very well.
There is a little bit on history in each one (not overdone) and they mostly look at the beautiful scenery, the wildlife and some shots of people walking the trails and enjoying the activities on offer etc. They are very well narrated with excellent background music.
The picture quality varies on the DVD's but they currently have five Blu-ray items (Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and two others on the desert parks). More are to come I believe. These are all magnificent !

Now to this review on Yosemite :
I was blown away both by the magnificence of the park plus the quality of this production. To see a place like this with crystal clear pictures really brings it alive, almost like being there. There is a bit on the history as usual with references to John Muir several times (as you would expect). A large portion of the documentary concentrates on Yosemite Valley and the views of virtually every waterfall in the valley, are spectacular. There are still good sections on the high country, especially later on, plus scenes in all seasons of the year. Special features include a look at three of the special lodging establishments in or near the Park (Awahnee, Wawona and Tenaya).
I am finding it difficult to put this disc away and could overdo it soon if I am not careful, but it is really a joy to watch.

One of the most impressive features of all Finley Holiday DVD's and Blu-ray DVD's, is that they are region free and will play anywhere in the world !

I thoroughly recommend this and the other Blu-ray features from Finley Holiday.",1334793600,5,1683,4.679054054054054
