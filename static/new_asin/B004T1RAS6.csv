8440387,2,B004T1RAS6,"This movie is unintentionally funny but in a good way. However, a VHS tape was obviously the source of the DVD and there were times that the tape tracking went off kilter. Since the seller was also the manufacturer, this is not good. Disc was so low in price it would cost me more to have it returned or replaced. Usually, Cheezyflix has better standards but no in this case.",1524268800,,375,4.371428571428571
8440388,1,B004T1RAS6,"Cheezy Flicks has provided NO service to film fans by releasing this awful transfer. Taken from a poor quality VHS master, it comes complete with numerous drop outs. Surely someone out there has a clean 16mm print they can release on DVD. Great to see Lon Chany return as the Wolf Man (That is if you can see him through the lousy quality). Pass big time on this dvd.",1393977600,,367,4.333333333333333
8440389,2,B004T1RAS6,"Not great late Lon Chaney Jr. werewolf flick.  This ""English-speaking""? version is edited from a better Mexican film called LA CASA DEL TERROR which translates to The House of Terror.  This virtually non-dialogue movie takes place in a wax museum and is something about a stolen mummy that changes to a Larry Talbot type of person who then changes to a wolfman when the moon is full.  None of it makes much sense.  I have the Cheezy Flicks version which is OK.  Only for horror movie collectors who have to have everything.",1383264000,4,523,4.641304347826087
8440390,1,B004T1RAS6,"A pitiful waste of time. This beauty runs a scant 60 minutes but you'll have your finger on the fast forward button no less. The history of this film is well known, it is a pastiche of two low budget Mexican movies from the late 50's-La Casa Del Terror and The Aztec Mummy. Promoter Jerry Warren bought those films, sliced and diced them, horribly dubbed the result into English and added a few moments of ""new"" footage. The draw of this film is that it contains footage of Lon Chaney Jr in his last role as a werewolf. Much of that footage should be attributed to a stunt double as ol' Lon is looking pretty bad here. He is very overweight and had been abusing alcohol for years and it shows on his face. I doubt if he was actually doing the running and jumping that the werewolf does in the film. He does not speak. Anyway, this thing is a real mess. It has an almost incoherent plot, not much dialogue and scenes of walking into an Aztec tomb that go on and on and on and on. The print offered by Cheezyflix is barely watchable and if this is indicative of their product then this will be my last purchase from them. It looks like a third or fourth generation VHS dub taken from television. It really is that bad. Save your money-it only cost $5 new but what the heck-why waste your money?",1364428800,8,1292,4.2560975609756095
