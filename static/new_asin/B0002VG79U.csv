8033010,4,B0002VG79U,"a short video, but has some good concepts. Some go by very quickly but overall worth watching a few times",1420848000,,105,4.3
8033011,5,B0002VG79U,Great instruction from Skinner. If players new half the tips he show it would make them better players. After watching it a few times it made me realize all the mistakes and lack of knowledge I and the teams I play with have. Simple stuff like how the goalie moves and where/how most percentage of goals are scored. Some players take the same type of shots almost everytime. If they knew how inefficient they were after watching this dvd they could change their whole game. This dvd shows you how to make the best shot from the best positions instead of just using blind brute force like many players. There are  some trick shots they show that are for the more advanced but most of it includes the fundementals great for all levels of players. I would  highly suggest buying this dvd as even just a few of Skinners tips will help improve your game.,1359763200,2,849,4.470967741935484
8033012,4,B0002VG79U,"Meaning me ... the goaltender! You get a very good perspective from these kinds of materials if you're the goalie in that it teaches you what the shooter looks for, thinks about, and how they approach these kinds of scoring attempts. A very good video, but I gave it a 4 star based on it being kind of spendy, but I still recommend it.",1347580800,,335,4.25
