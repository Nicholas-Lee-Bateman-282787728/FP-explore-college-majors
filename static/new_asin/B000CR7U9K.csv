8101007,5,B000CR7U9K,Glad I got all of his  videos on speycasting. Like them the best of all the different videos from various casting gurus. Simple step by step instructions that I could easily understand.,1415232000,,185,4.78125
8101008,5,B000CR7U9K,Love the video but it makes it sound too easy. John clearly knows what he is talking about though. Great advice for any steelheader.,1378684800,,132,4.541666666666667
8101009,5,B000CR7U9K,"This DVD is an excellent compliment to John & Amy Hazel's spey casting DVD's.  Once you can get your fly out in the river with a two-handed rod, John covers everything you need to know to hook steelhead.  This is good, practical instruction from one of the most experienced spey guides & teachers out there.  I think almost anyone will pick up some useful tips.  John discusses leaders, knots & flies and then fishes a few runs showing how to cover the water with surface skaters, wet flies and droppers.  Thorough attention is given to likely holding water and steelhead behavior on the take.  Great video!

This DVD will be most helpful for beginner and intermediate steelhead fly fishers but also for advanced students of the sport who can't get enough.",1208217600,3,756,4.7251908396946565
8101010,5,B000CR7U9K,"THIS DVD HAS THE MOST INFO FOR SPEY FISHING THAT I'VE CAME ACROSS. RATING THIS WITH 5 STAR, DOES NOT DO THIS DVD ANY GOOD. IT SHOULD BE RATED ABOUT 70 TO 80 ON THE SCALE THAT IS PROVIDED.",1168819200,,187,3.8205128205128207
8101011,4,B000CR7U9K,"Particularly useful if you fish the Deschutes for Summer steelhead.  There is very little attention given to spey casting techniques as it is mostly addressing steelhead holding water.  A little time is given to knots and flies, but most of the time is devoted to watching John fish. I would recomend it if you are heading to the Deschutes this summer.",1168473600,5,352,4.754098360655738
