8540382,5,B0001EQIDI,I loved this video so much from my first two children that I purchased even on VHS for my third.,1363651200,,96,3.85
8540383,4,B0001EQIDI,"This is a fun way for kids ages 1-5 to learn Spanish. My kids are 18 months and almost 3 and they LOVE this. In fact they watched it once with their 2 year old cousin and my oldest was teaching the cousin how to say the numbers in spanish. Cousin went home saying 11-14 in Spanish. We live in Canada where Spanish is NOT the second language so it's not like they hear it much of anywhere except Dora (which has also taught them a lot)

It's short and that's pretty much my only qualm with it.",1225584000,,492,4.020408163265306
8540384,5,B0001EQIDI,"This is an adorable DVD and a cute way to introduce Spanish to toddlers and babies. Although Professor Parrot uses both English and Spanish rather than an immersion approach, some sequences are all in Spanish. The Spanish is spoken slowly for children to grasp onto all of the sounds heard by all of the speakers. My 13 month old triplets adore the music and the Goldilocks story. A hit for any child.",1213056000,,401,4.583333333333333
