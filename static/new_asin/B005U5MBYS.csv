8486760,5,B005U5MBYS,"I really enjoyed this show when I was younger and would really like all of the episodes to be released so that I can relive my childhood and hopefully pass it on to the next generation. I felt that the packaging could have been a little better. The outer box is good, but the discs themselves are just in paper sleeves inside the box. I couldn't find a list of the content on this DVD anywhere and so didn't know until actually buying it and looking through the discs myself what was included. The box advertises 18 episodes but each of those is broken into two individual sub episodes which means you get 36 separate stories. I have listed the contents of the discs below:

Disc 1
Day for Knight/All Alone and Feeling Boo
Zoom-Zooms Wish/Gnome Alone
The Art of Magic/Never Wish Upon a Star
Stop! Pay Troll!/Whookerpop
Speed of Flight/Just Desserts
In Your Dream/Science Friction
A Harp Days Night/It Came from Outer Space
Sea Sickness/A Clear and Present Scribbles
Pocket Dragons vs. The Flying Saucer/Minky Business

Disc 2
The Unicorn Hunters/Down Deep
Snow Job/A Rocky Friendship
A Cold, Cruel World/Pen Pals
Masquerade/Ducks Amok
Shmahz Strikes Again/The Nervous Novice
A Dragon in this Dress/Malice with the Chalice
King of the Hill/Disguise in Love with You
Follow the Leader/Trashmandu
Surely you Joust/Pillow Squawk

I'm unclear if these were all the original episode pairings. The second episode was not listed in the episode menu. I had to skip forward to look at the title card, but I've included screenshots of the menus below. IMDB and tv.com proved unhelpful as they had completely different numbering systems and season divisions. The most important thing to observe is that the first 6 episodes on disc 1 are the exact same as those included on the Pocket Dragon Adventures: In Your Dreams DVD. For that reason, I recommend you just buy this one. And hopefully, with enough sales, Mill Creek or some other studio will put out the rest of the episodes for us.",1434412800,,1975,4.837278106508876
