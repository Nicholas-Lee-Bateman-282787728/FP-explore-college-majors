8334829,5,B0000A2ZOH,Bought this to complete my GTO DVD collection. Used to be $20+ and now it is only a few dollars.,1417737600,,96,3.85
8334830,5,B0000A2ZOH,If you don't know what GTO is and your a big anime fan looking for good laughs and can handle a bit of adult humor and some suggestive material then I recommend that you see this anime.,1375660800,,185,4.027027027027027
8334831,2,B0000A2ZOH,GTO drags along for tons of episodes to crap a conclusion into two abrupt episodes. I did not like it at all.,1354492800,,109,4.0
8334832,5,B0000A2ZOH,"GTO was an increidable anime. Different than most others in many ways. It made laugh so hard sometimes and it made me feel serious in certain points. .The DVD is real cool because it's in Japanese also which I prefer ito watch with anime.  I just wish it had lasted as long as the manga.

  Onizuka is really a GREAT teacher in my book!!",1069027200,2,337,4.21875
8334833,5,B0000A2ZOH,"Alas, this signals the end of the GTO anime... What a sad day it is. I can remember eagerly waiting and literaly counting the days for each new volume. GTO has taken me to emotional and comical extremes and I will always have those good memories of sitting in my room turning on the DVD to watch my favorite defender of justice dish it out with extreme prejudice. So what's next for GTO? Maybe a new series that takes place in the USA? We'll have to wait and see, but for now at least I can sit back and watch the series again and again and never forget those funny and emotional times. The impact of Onizuka has taken it's toll so well that I'm actually studying to become a teacher. Hopefully I can use my new found inspiration to make school ""Fun again""
Goodbye Onizuka, We'll all miss you...
TEACHER FOR LIFE!!!",1065398400,5,815,4.333333333333333
