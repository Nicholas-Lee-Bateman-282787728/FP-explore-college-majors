5073550,4,B007BMIG6U,"Dark, eerie, scary...these are are words that some have used to describe Fuyumi Ono's horror novel ""Shiki"".

A story that would lead to a manga adaptation featuring artwork drawn by Ryu Fujisaki and serialized in the magazine ""Jump SQ"" from December 2007-2011, the popularity of the series would lead to an anime TV series in 2010 produced by anime studio, Daume (best known for ""Onegai Teacher!""). The series also caught a lot of attention when Japanese rock star Gackt announced he would voice one of the characters in the series.

And now the series will be released on Blu-ray and DVD (in two parts) in May 2012 courtesy of FUNimation Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""Shiki"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and the anime studio Daume has done a wonderful job in character design and art backgrounds. Typically anime studios are on a time restraint and are working on multiple anime series at a time but Daume is one of the few studios that tend to put all their focus onto a single series at a time.

The art backgrounds are lush and beautiful, homes and overall village structures are well-detailed and the character designs are actually quite stylish and with colors that support the darker anime feel but also a colors that look absolutely vibrant at times.

With that being said, the anime series still has a softness (that most anime TV series has) and one should not expect OVA or film quality type of anime, but still this is a series that looks fantastic with its detail of structures and interior of homes. ""Shiki"" definitely looks very good!

AUDIO:

""Shiki"" is presented in English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and Japanese DolbyTrue HD 2.0. This is an anime series that primarily focuses on dialogue and if there are action sequences, the action is quick. But the series does make up in ambiance. You'll hear like insects flying, heartbeats, wind, cars passing by and everything that one can expect in a rural village. If anything, the series utilizes a spooky ambiance and sound effects to freak viewers out. The English soundtrack has more dynamic range but when it comes to voice acting, both are well-done.

The biggest standout for this series is the music. The musical soundtrack by Yasuharu Takanashi is fantastic, especially the opening and ending theme of the series.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

There have been a few dark, creepy anime that has made it to America within the last five years. And similar to the United States, even Japan has had its share of anime series incorporating vampires to a storyline.

But what makes ""Shiki"" so unique is that it doesn't retain the banality of the usual vampire storyline. This is not a series about a group of teenagers unleashing a counterattack against the vampires, nor is this a storyline about a vampire or human falling in love. This is a story about a rural Japanese town in which the vampires plan to eradicate all humanity and literally turn everyone into a vampire.

Each time we were introduced to a character, you would expect that this character would be a main character in the storyline, but beginning with the first episode, viewers quickly learn that each character is essentially going to be a victim. In some way, it reminded me of ""Boogiepop Phantom"", a darker anime series from 2000 that seemed every character introduced, their livelihoods were futile.

But what makes the anime series work is that we get to meet these villagers, learn of their quirks and if anything, feel comfortable with each and everyone of them...that is until the okiagari begin to target them.

The same can be said with ""Shiki"" as the townspeople think that people are dying of an epidemic, while very few people suspect that a new family that has moved to the area is responsible. And sure enough, when people start to see old friends who have died, walking around, what do you do? How you can fight against these reborn monsters?

The first half of the series focused on the deaths of many in the village and the discovery by Natsuno Yuuki, Toshio Ozaki and brother and sister, Kaori and Akira Tanaka discovering that there is no epidemic but deaths caused by the okiagari (vampire). And to make things worst, there appears to be no defense against them. They keep rising and they are growing by the numbers. Also, it doesn't help that there are specialized vampires such as Tatsumi who can withstand the sunlight and literally use his charm to get people to let him into their homes and thus leading to a person's quick death.

The second half of the series, the roles are reversed dramatically.  We knew that the people of the village were starting to find out about the vampires, we knew that Natsuno and Toshio Ozaki had to do something.  And that something begins with this second half of the series.

We have seen the perspective of the humans, the second half gives us a glimpse of the vampires.  While some seem vicious, those of the village who were brought back as vampires struggle with their past human feelings of caring for an individual, wanting to be with a person or their family but unfortunately, because of what they are, they crave blood and when they don't feed, that is when the vampire takes over their body and literally makes them to vicious monsters.

Unfortunately, without spoiling the series, there is not much that I can say but that everything you watched in the first half of the series and made you sympathetic towards the humans, your perspective may change as you get to see other side of things.  Especially learning of the history of certain individuals.  But for those who have been wanting to see humanity fight back, will then you're going to love what happens in the second half of the series.

And if there is anything that I can say is that the violence and bloodshed will increase dramatically with each episode and for those who have a low tolerance towards blood, you have been warned... as this series gets bloodier and bloodier with each episode.

Also, don't forget to watch what happens after the ending credits of the final episode.

As for the Blu-ray release, Daume, an anime studio who usually doesn't rush into anime production has once again done a fantastic job with this series. With most TV series, many anime studios are typically hampered by multiple projects they have to get to a television studio but with Daume, one of the few that tends to focus on a series and thus dedicates its staff into making wonderful looking anime series. Granted, the setting is the country and a lot of the backgrounds one will see are trees, fields, forests, etc. But they manage to put quite a bit of detail on their background art and also on the actual character designs which are quite stylish. Especially with the combination of dark to vibrant colors that really pop on Blu-ray. The voice acting is well-done on both lossless soundtracks and there are a few audio commentary tracks included.

Overall, It's been a long while since I have watched an anime series so dark, eerie and where situations are so unexpected. And from this second half of ""Shiki"", all I can say is that... I enjoyed this series a lot.  It's quite violent and bloody but for those who are up to a very intense but enjoyable series featuring humans vs. vampires, will find ""Shiki"" to be a series worth watching.

Recommended for anime fans who enjoy violent, dark and eerie anime!",1352332800,2,8570,4.820232399179767
5073551,5,B007BMIG6U,"Shiki, aka Vampires, are taking over a village in the mountains. The village is cut off from civilization, and a bit behind the times. A family called the Kirishiki's move into town. At the same time the village experiences a long series of deaths. Only a few residents actually start to catch on to the fact that the Kirishiki's are behind it. This anime has everything beautiful art, amazing soundtrack, likable characters, and a very engrossing story. I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling the fun, but I will say that Shiki stands at the top of the horror anime genre. Definitely check it out.",1348876800,5,608,4.587155963302752

My only complaint about the show is that some of the character designs honestly didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the show, but that's just nitpicking. If you decide to pick this up, be aware that the show is like a train. It which it starts out slow and picks up speed with every episode. By the end, you will be glued to the edge of your seat.
On a side note, I thought it had a particularly good soundtrack that really set the mood.

5073554,5,B007BMIG6U,"I highly enjoyed this series. The story, characters, music selection, and dubbing where all done very well. I have mostly lost my taste for vampires after the whole Twilight trash but this anime really had me. It is very dark and twisted, so if that isn't up your alley then you might want to avoid this title. As for me, I highly enjoyed it and the story was superb. There was also a small philosophical aspect to it, which makes the vampires seem less evil and of course there are the array of characters who display different aspects on bother the human and vampire side. It is an excellent anime and though I personally thought it ended a little to quickly for my taste, it did tie up all the loose ends without an excessive amount of filler like some 200+episode animes. If you don't mind gloom and darkness in your anime, then you must get this one. Especially for the affordable price.",1346371200,3,892,4.478527607361963
5073555,5,B007BMIG6U,"Shiki is a well-animated anime full of horror and tragedy throughout the series.

I personally love this anime and how it keeps you in suspense and keeps you guessing what happens next. Both English and Japanese versions go good together. The characters and the artwork are beautifully drawn and colored. This is a great horror anime that goes beyond any other.

If you watch this series from beginning to end, you will never want to sleep.",1338768000,11,440,4.776315789473684

5073587,5,B007BMIG6U,"Shiki is unlike any other anime series I have ever seen.  Horror is a hard genre to tackle in animation, especially anime.  What scares us changes from culture to culture, but Shiki manages to overcome those barriers to create a stunning, chilling and atmospheric series that will stick with you long after you have finished watching.

The storytelling in Shiki is amazing.  The show has a gigantic cast, and yet somehow it manages to not only tell every story well, but it also manages to give depth to almost every character that crosses your screen.  Even small, side stories carry emotional weight that, as the story builds, carry an emotional gut punch.  This show is not interested in clear cut good and evil, and it is better for it.  The monsters are humanized, given a depth that makes the audience conflicted in their feelings towards them, and the humans are shown to be just monstrous enough to make one question their motives. This is not an easy show to watch.  As the story builds, and stories reach their crescendos, characters are exposed to brutal violence and death.

This is also a show with a good deal of restraint.  There is almost zero fan service, and the violence, while at times extreme, is not extreme so much because of gore, but because of the emotional weight behind the actions.

The art in this show is stunning.  Again, this show has an extremely large cast, and the art style gives each character their own flair and sets every person apart from one another.  While the characters may at times appear odd (especially when it comes to the hair and eyes), each character is easily identifiable.  The animation is smooth and beautiful, using simple techniques to create dread and suspense.

The story itself is like if someone had take Salems' Lot, or a Bentley Little novel, and transported it to a small Japanese village.  While the first half creates looming dread, and impending doom, this particular set is a mad dash towards the finish.  Somehow, and this is because of the amazing skill that went into crafting this story, at no time does the story seemed rushed.

I watched this show dubbed, and was blown away not only be the amazing performances from all the cast, but the strong script that carries the show.  The dialogue feels natural, smooth, and every character feels genuine.  The voice acting is strong, with each actor handling the emotional highs and lows of the series with such amazing skills.  Never once was I pulled out of the story by a voice that felt off or miss cast.

Overall, Shiki is an amazing series, unlike any anime series I have seen before.  The skill from every angle that went into this series has created a product that is both terrifying, heart breaking and most importantly, highly entertaining.  This is a series for both anime fans, and non-fans alike.  Do yourself a favor and give Shiki a shot.  (Start from set one.  This story is very twisty and turny, and missing one episode will make the whole show feel off.)",1386547200,2,2992,4.6928982725527835

The voice Acting was great and kept going great even for the dubbed English version

You do have to watch it all sometimes you will be going back and re-watching some parts over and over again.

If you like stuff along the lines of Ghost Hound (one of my favorites), Another (scary and a favorite),Ghost Hunt (I don't see why people compare Ghost Hound vs Hunt as they are completely different, GHunt being more cutesy with a completely different story, you don't have to like one or the other, you can like both... but I definitely liked GHound more being it was a little more mature/scary to me), Higurashi no Naku koro ni, Mushishi (not scary but ""otherworldly""), Monster (another one of my all time FAVORITES), Gankutsuou (more with the vampire stuff, not one of my favorites but good).

5073592,5,B007BMIG6U,"this show was amazing, it was very dark but it had its comic relief spread around in it; or else it would be unbearably sad and dark, sort of like how they made star wars have funny droids to compensate for anikan murdering children and  the jedi being murdered by old allies.

if you like vampires get this show for sure",1359676800,,321,4.245901639344262
5073593,5,B007BMIG6U,"Please consider this review alongside Part 1. The two parts are not stand-alone. Part 2 concludes the story of the terrible events that grip a small village in Japan, a village just as up to date as anywhere else (though without cellphone coverage) but with its own peculiar attributes.

The personalities set in play in Part 1 conclude their destinies. Each is well thought out. You may not like everything that happens to everyone, but you will be entertained and scared.

Yes, Shiki is a horror story. Bad things happen to good people, and also to bad people.

I was very impressed with the new ways of treating old storylines and the vampire genre. I will definitely watch it again and I suspect it will bear many viewings. The English dub is excellent: there were no mismatches of voice to character.

Bonus features: There are a couple of commentaries by some of the voice cast, which are good value in terms of hearing how they felt about the story. Nothing special, just worth listening to.

Quality of picture: Excellent
Quality of music: Generally about right. This is subjective: for some people, music constantly playing at a quite noticeable volume over the climactic scenes is unwelcome, but I watch a lot of anime and found it fine.
Story: Excellent
Voice cast: English cast - excellent. I briefly listened to the original but cannot rate it.

I had bought this series on a whim, even though I usually pre-watch all my anime online, and I was obviously not disappointed. If you think you'll like it, get it. It won't get a simple once-over from your player, I promise.
