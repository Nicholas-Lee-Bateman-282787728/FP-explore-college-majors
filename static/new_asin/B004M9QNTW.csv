8435739,5,B004M9QNTW,"This is a really fascinating & well-done program. I'd been looking for this DVD for a long time after seeing it several years ago on TV, but it was inexplicably hard to find. It follows the journey of martial arts champion & actor Mark Dacascos as he travels Japan, exploring the ancient culture and history of the Samurai, particularly the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi. Dacascos is a wonderful guide and his enthusiasm for the subject, along with his sincere desire to understand who and why Musashi was the man he was is infectious. The interspersed live-action bits of battles are also excellently done.
I'm not even really interested in martial arts or, for that matter, the weird brutal culture that gave rise to the enigmatic Samurai, but I love this DVD & I'm thrilled to have finally found it. Fascinating, touching, exciting, enlightening ---- this program is all of that & more. I highly recommend it!!!",1456358400,3,921,4.910256410256411

8435746,5,B004M9QNTW,"This is less about the history of the Samurai but more about it's most known, Miyamoto Musashi. Yet it's a loving story told through the journey of self rediscovery by Mark Dacascos, it's beautifully told and the images are better than some films. it's worth every cent.",1330387200,18,270,4.76595744680851
