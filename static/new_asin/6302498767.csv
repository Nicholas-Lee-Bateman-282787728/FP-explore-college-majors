7827365,4,6302498767,"The plot for this film is like something out of one of the sleazier Italian gialli of the early to mid-'70s: a deranged, religiously-motivated killer is stalking the participants of an amateur group sex porno video, stabbing them to death (in gory, blood-spurting close-ups) with his cane-sword.

Maribel Guardia (looking and dressing way too hot to play a plausible police detective - but, then, this IS a movie, after all) is on the hunt for the killer, investigating a string of murders that leads her deeper and deeper into various layers of Mexico City depravity (including - shudder! - a visit to a mixed gay bar).

Maribel, a widow with a young girl child, is still recovering from the death of her cop husband (shown in flashbacks), while Jorge Luke, a friend, pines for her, hoping that she'll get over the guy so that he can get into her pants. (You can't blame the guy - she is pretty hot.)

Her character's nickname is 'La Alacrana,' which translates as 'The Female Scorpion.' I think the origin of this was explained, but my Spanish is not good enough to follow what was being said. Maribel's character is NOT (as some have erroneously contended) a superheroine of any kind; just a hard-nosed cop with a cool nickname.

All in all, this is a pretty good policier, with some well-staged, gory kills. Giallo fans might want to check it out to see a south-of-the-border variation on the genre. Maribel Guardia fans are guaranteed lots of footage of her in sexy outfits (including some low cut tops and a scene in a white bikini).",1304985600,2,1539,4.688888888888889
