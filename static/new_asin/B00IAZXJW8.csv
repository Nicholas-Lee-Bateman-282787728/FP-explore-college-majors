My American DVD players just doesn't play PAL or UK Region 2 format.
They say buy an all-region DVD player from Costco so I did but it conked-out after only a few months (made-in-China crap) after the warranty ran out.
So when will Warner Home Video make a Complete Set of Two and a Half Men (Seasons 1-10) in USA Region 1?
We Have Bundles of most single seasons in the USA but they are not in a set so much more expensive. (like $30 each per season) :(
So when will Warner Home Video make a Complete Boxed-Set of Two and a Half Men (Seasons 1-10) for American Region 1 USA Version?  or are they just being greedy?",1403654400,,741,4.145833333333333
