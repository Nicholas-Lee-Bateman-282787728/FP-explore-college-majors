3443887,3,B0019UGYB4,"I've waited a long time to finally see this movie, and I was a little disappointed, the relationship between Martin a Lewis seemed strained. No ""set"" pieces that usually have me falling off my chair. Having said that, I'm a huge fan and I enjoyed it.",1223164800,,250,4.456521739130435
3443888,5,B0019UGYB4,"I am a huge Martin & Lewis fan and before Paramount became so gracious and began to release these classic films, I had copies I taped off of AMC & TCM and actually have all 16 M & L's on personal VHS, but finally Paramount got off their rears and released films 1-2 & 4 through 9 in M & L volume 1, as At War With the Army is in public domain, then in volume 2 I was awaiting more than anything, Money From Home, and it wasn't in the set, neither was 3 Ring Circus?! That really bothered me because I thought Paramount was going to complete the series...well thank GOD they allowed LEGEND, through their own distribution to release Money from Home, and the transfer is PERFECT, the film is top notch technicolor & beautiful Marjie Millar & Pat Crowley are stunning mates for our 2 heroes Dean & Jerry...The great Damon Runyon characters are alive and well in this one, No Knees Nolan, Jumbo Schneider, Fat Phil, The Seldom Seen Kid, etc., a must see for all Martin & Lewis fans, and fans of classic comedy...Dean Croons perfectly & Jerry does a bang up job in his Cyrano impression, in this their 1st ever Color film, originally shot in 3D.

If you get the chance, buy this DVD, you'll laugh...So, Do me Something!?",1222646400,,1215,4.352422907488987
3443889,5,B0019UGYB4,"I used to catch ""Money From Home"" all the time on TV when I was a kid, and it still hasn't lost its punch. Martin & Lewis' first film in color sparkles on the screen, and is downright hilarious. MFH captures the duo at the crest of their success, and before tensions between them arose later that year (1954).
Rumor has it that it was excluded from the official Martin & Lewis Collection because Damon Runyon's estate refused permission to use it. I'm glad it finally got its release, even if it's sold separately from the collection.
Now...please, please, PLEASE put the missing ""Three Ring Circus"" on DVD for us to enjoy!",1222128000,2,623,4.571428571428571
3443890,4,B0019UGYB4,"For reasons unknown (to me), Paramount's DEAN MARTIN & JERRY LEWIS COLLECTION VOLUME TWO does not include MONEY FROM HOME and 3 RING CIRCUS. Both films are among the team's lesser efforts, but it still would have been nice if they had been a part of this set. Now MONEY FROM HOME has been released as a separate disc, as per Legend Films' licensing deal with Paramount. This is good news for M&L diehards, who will want to add this title to their collection.

Originally photographed in 3-D, MONEY FROM HOME (1953), the team's first film in color, places suave Dino and screwball Jerry in the 1920s world of horseracing, Prohibition, and gangsters. While several set-pieces garner chuckles and smiles, they fail to deliver the sort of huge belly-laughs found in other Martin & Lewis pictures. One major exception is a sequence in which Jerry frantically lip-synchs to Dean's rendition of ""I Only Have Eyes For You."" It's a brilliant bit of pantomime. If only more passages had been up to this level.

MONEY FROM HOME is a pleasant if forgettable trifle, and if you`re already a Martin & Lewis addict, then you`ll enjoy this outing much more than an average viewer will. If the sight of Jerry masquerading as a harem girl sends you into uncontrollable hysterics, then this is a movie tailor-made for your tastes.

Kids will probably get a big kick out of this film, so if you're judging this entry as family-friendly fare, you may rate it higher than I do. However, the aforementioned MARTIN & LEWIS COLLECTION VOLUME TWO -- which contains LIVING IT UP, YOU'RE NEVER TOO YOUNG, ARTISTS AND MODELS, PARDNERS, and HOLLYWOOD OR BUST -- provides superior examples of Dean and Jerry's brand of comedy and song.

Technically speaking, this DVD transfer is first-rate, with breathtaking color values. Paramount made some of the most visually stunning Technicolor movies of the 1950s, and this one is no exception. But there are no extras. Not even a measly theatrical trailer. If they didn't have one for MONEY FROM HOME, you'd think they would have included other Martin & Lewis trailers instead. (A trivial note: The back cover includes a  shot of Dean and Jerry with Donna Reed from THE CADDY. Is there a shortage of MONEY FROM HOME photos?)

So now that MONEY FROM HOME has been released, where is 3 RING CIRCUS? I think it`s the weakest of the 16 feature films Dean and Jerry made together, but I would still like to see it on DVD.",1219190400,17,2428,4.714622641509434
3443891,5,B0019UGYB4,I have been waiting a very long time for this movie to come out.  I actually called Paramount Studios about 2 1/2 to 3 years ago to ask them if it would ever be out on dvd.  The gentleman told me that around June of I think '06 it would be packaged with some other movies from Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis so to watch for it.  It was advertised just as he said so my husband bought the group for me for Christmas.  The package was miss-marked with the right title but wrong movie.  I kept the pack anyway because I love Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis movies.  I just kept waiting and watching. I decided to check recently and there it was on Amazon in a single dvd.  I knew Amazon would come through for me.  I got the movie and loved it just as much as when I first saw it.  My 13 year old loves it too.  Very funny. So happy.  See ya.,1217462400,8,832,3.9221556886227544
3443892,5,B0019UGYB4,"This is the first Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis film to be released in color.  Additionally, upon the original release, it was 3D.

The film takes place in the 1920s and revolves around the racetrack (horse racing, that is).  These sorts of films were popular in the 1940s and 50s and Martin and Lewis were trend setters.  Like many of their previous and forthcoming works, this movie is not only loaded with humor, but music and song as well.

This marks the release of fifteen out of sixteen Martin & Lewis films on DVD.  The last one we're waiting for is ""Three Ring Circus"".  I also hope more Jerry Lewis titles are on the way, we still need:  ""Visit to a Small Planet"", ""Who's Minding the Store?"", ""Rock-a-Bye Baby"", ""Hardly Working"", ""Cracking Up"", ""Which Way to the Front"", and others.

I am happy to report the quality of this DVD is excellent and licensed through Paramount.",1215043200,35,881,4.596153846153846

3443894,5,B0019UGYB4,"At first I was skeptical about this purchase because it's not in 3-D, the way it was originally photographed.  And also I heard it was presented in widescreen, meaning the original Fullscreen version had been edited. But it IS in its original Fullscreen aspect ratio of 1.37:1!  Even though it's 2-D, the picture quality is still better than the previous release by Legend Films.  As for the film itself, it's Dean & Jerry in there prime and very funny, not their best, but well worth the watch for sure!  It's sad that Olive Films wouldn't release it in 3-D, but this is probably the best release we will ever see!",1499212800,3,615,4.5636363636363635

3443931,2,B0019UGYB4,"Martin and Lewis were two of the funniest men in Hollywood, and each one of their movies was funnier than the other. However, I can not say that about this movie. It was truly a ""stupid"" movie. Sometimes you watch a movie from the time you were a kid and say ""wow, that was really a funny movie"" those are  just the memories you have, sometimes you say ""gee, I did not realize how silly those movies were and I can't believe I watched them."" Not in this case, I can't say that the movie was silly, it was just dumb.

Having said that there are, to date, no comedians who can come close to the style and humor of a Martin and Lewis film. Sorry Hollywood you just can't compare with these classic funnymen.",1366329600,,704,4.207407407407407

3443935,2,B0019UGYB4,"I am NOT a fan of Damon Runyon or ""Guys and Dolls"", but I DO like Martin and Lewis, so I got this DVD. But I could hardly watch it. The best moment, in my opinion, is Jerry helping a mother dog cross a busy street. The rest of it I fast-forwarded through very quickly... oh well. I may trade this one back in to Amazon for store credit.
I also noticed, as another reviewer here did too, that the DVD's cover art is peculiar. As far as the disc, the actual digital film transfer is well done, and the color looks very good for being more than a half-century old.

Not sure why it wasn't included in the Martin & Lewis sets that featured all of their movies but three. The movie itself is a classic but I was disappointed in the cover art.

Also, on the front cover, I noticed the dollar bills used were not even in existance when this movie was made. Very poor graphic design if you ask me.",1241740800,,544,4.046296296296297
