6509457,5,B00LXDQ7OQ,"Great program! Keister, Geiter and Faulkner shine as the hillbilly esque crypt keepers. I laughed and I had nightmares. If you enjoy horror-comedies then you must order Hillbilly Horror Show!",1407456000,2,191,5.4
6509458,5,B00LXDQ7OQ,"A very well done show! The hosts in this show are a talented group of actors who are also hilarious. They always have me laughing hard before each mini episode. The mini episodes are unique and creepy, and showcase some great talent. I love the variety from each horror short so it doesn't feel repetitive, and the comedy that the hosts inject!",1407369600,2,344,4.564516129032258
6509459,5,B00LXDQ7OQ,"I love the concept, and it is a treat to be exposed to such a variety of horror shorts. These four films could not be any more diverse - the first is reminiscent of Tarantino, while the second is straight from the Harryhausen playbook - but Bo, Cephus and Lulu bring it all together and inject a lot of fun too. A great watch, well worth the time!",1407283200,2,347,4.117647058823529

8668759,5,B00LXDQ7OQ,"I saw this show on a free internet television streaming site, and being from the south, I had to watch it at least once.  It was absolutely amazing.  Some of the movie shorts are flat out amazing, most are really good, and only a  few (1 or 2 tops) just kind of suck.  Each show has 3-4 of these shorts, though, so the sucky ones don't matter that much.  Plus the minute or so segments between the movies are hilarious.  And gracious... that Lulu.",1415750400,,447,4.261904761904762
8668760,5,B00LXDQ7OQ,"I know what you're doing right now.  You are in the process of rolling your eyes and shaking your head as you read the title of todays review.  You are also probably thinking to yourself, Man, hes getting desperate for review material if hes looking into stuff like this.  Well, my friend, you are wrong on both counts there.  HILLBILLY HORROR SHOW might have a goofy title, but it packs a punch when it comes to horror.  And while the hillbilly characters and aspects of the show might be humorous, they offset the terrifying frights from the short films within nicely.

I have to confess I didn't expect much from this show going into it.  Just the title alone is enough to dissuade a diehard horror fan like me to pass it over.  But Im sure glad I gave this one a look.  It is vividly entertaining, full of humor and terror alike, and I cant wait see where future volumes go.

The comedy aspect of HILLBILLY HORROR SHOW works well, as it lightens the mood from the dark tones the short films set.  The characters are aloof and funny, well thought-out stereotypes that play right along with each other.  Likewise, their antics onscreen will make you grin and roll your eyesbut this is a good thing.

But the horror shorts are why you should sink your fangs into this show.  We only get to see four in this volume, but they are all great.  Each is shot well and does an excellent job of telling a story in such a short time.  My favorite film in this volume is The Nest.  Aside from an interesting storyline, this short is very well made and full of tension-filled frights.  I could definitely see this as a Syfy Channel movie in the future.

HILLBILLY HORROR SHOW is a definite win for me, and I highly recommend giving it a look.  It is described as Hee-Haw meets Creepshow, so you know you're in for a treat with that tagline.  Give this a look for sure.",1414022400,,1858,4.374269005847953
