1972832,5,B00015NN94,"I got this one for my grandmother who has never exercised since her teens. She is now doing some portion of this every day and loving it!

Evamarie has a very pleasant presence that my grandmother just loves too.

I would recommend this for any elderly individual or anyone that needs to take it very easy for whatever reason.",1131926400,25,326,4.508474576271187
1972833,5,B00015NN94,"I'm a newcomer to yoga, and this DVD set my mind to ease about my ability to learn yoga at home (I don't have access to group classes as they conflict with my schedule).  The flow of the workout is perfect, I don't feel rushed and yet her program design and instructions keep me focused.  The time flies by and I feel much more calm upon finishing.  I've actually recommended this DVD to a few friends of mine who have tried group classes yet felt they moved too fast for their level of ability.  I think this is a great way for a person to get their first taste of yoga.  It's now been a month and I'm already feeling stronger and more flexible.  I'm no longer sore upon getting out of bed and I sleep much better.  If you already have yoga under your belt, you'll probably find this workout too easy.  But if you really are new to yoga, this DVD lives exactly up to its title.",1127952000,44,878,4.153846153846154
1972834,1,B00015NN94,"I ordered this DVD.  The program looked like it was what I was looking for esepecially after I read the reviews.  Unfortunately the DVD I received is garbled and defective.  I received an email after I complained to Amazon that a new DVD would be shipped to me.  However, I never received anything.  I would think twice about ordering.  You might get defective merchandise as well.",1126310400,,381,4.696969696969697
1972835,5,B00015NN94,"I chose this DVD because I would definitely consider myself an ""extreme"" beginner at yoga.  I'm not very flexible and I've always felt self-conscious about my coordination.  But I also have a weak back and I know I need to lose weight and exercise more.  I LOVE this DVD.  Evamarie immediately sets a relaxed and very manageable pace.  Her voice is soothing and her manner is very down to earth.  She has no one-legged balancing poses or ""pretzel"" positions (thank goodness for me), but what she does have is sufficiently challenging to make me feel like I've had a good workout.  She is very explicit about proper form and allows for plenty of options if any pose feels out of your comfort zone.  The outdoor setting is pleasing to eye, and the classical music is ambient without being overpowering.  I feel like I'm well on my way to finally get into shape!",1071964800,188,859,4.598684210526316
1972856,4,B00015NN94,"I bought this video over 15 months ago to get started doing yoga, but even now, after buying several more videos, it is still one of my favorites. Eva Marie Pilapuf takes you through an hour of various warm up exercises and yoga poses. So many introductory Yoga vidoes are so challenging that they discourage prospective practitioners. Most people using this video, however, will not get outside their comfort zones doing these poses, but after the workout they will feel good about themselves from the activity and their accomplishments. Isn't that what Yoga should be all about?",1171065600,12,580,4.989690721649485
1972857,1,B00015NN94,"This is a scam and a rip-off. This is a DVD of someone going through some motions, but not yoga. I wouldn't even call it calisthenics. Even a complete couch potato expends more energy than this woman does.  Please don't be fooled by the title - even the most extreme of beginners deserve more than what this woman is offering.  If I can give this a rating less than 0 stars I would.",1145232000,23,382,4.219178082191781
1972858,4,B00015NN94,"I too have problems with low back pain and as suggested by my physical therapist, yoga might be a good alternative since traction wasn't all that helpful. I found that Evamarie starts her warm up with a few gentle Tai Chi-type moves and eases into some gentle yoga and ends with a meditation-type cool down. I did not find the pace too rapid, and to be honest, I didn't watch the DVD all the way through prior to trying the positions. If you are terribly out of shape, the pace might be a bit fast, otherwise no problem. I found it a nice starter DVD.",1143417600,22,551,4.257142857142857
1972859,2,B00015NN94,"Very disappointing.  If this is for beginners, I wonder what a DVD for ""experts"" would be like.  The rhythm of the movements was too fast, and the sound was not at all soothing, which to me is the essence of Yoga.  Perhaps I didn't know what to expect since I have never taken any yoga classes.  But that was my purpose in ordering this ""beginning"" Yoga DVD--too learn the basics and the ""feel"" of Yoga.",1143244800,18,403,4.333333333333333
1972860,1,B00015NN94,"I am a yoga instructor and I bought this DVD hoping to gain insights to teach to beginning students. This DVD is NOT a real yoga session and the word yoga should not even be in the title! What I did see was a woman who was very flexible, quite possibly a dancer, doing a workout routine that incorporated some yoga movements. In most of the movements she taught, this instructor was hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion.

Pass this one up!",1142899200,94,458,4.4523809523809526
1972861,5,B00015NN94,"I recently went through a bunch of physical therapy for spine and foot problems, and was afraid of getting active again.  This DVD is truly ""gentle"" and well put together for those who know nothing about yoga.  Once you are in shape this will be a bore.  However, PERFECT for anyone who needs to take it easy at the start.",1142380800,6,322,4.333333333333333
1972862,4,B00015NN94,This is a great yoga dvd for people that are just starting out. Also for anyone who just needs to stretch more.,1141344000,9,111,4.090909090909091
1972863,3,B00015NN94,"This is a good non-stressful workout.  Very much about stretching and reaching - no pounding or jumping.  I like the exercises.  The music is blah, but the outdoor setting is nice.  The instructor goes very slow - this would be good for someone older as well.  I like it.",1141084800,10,271,4.448979591836735
1972864,1,B00015NN94,"This video is a poorly-filmed, self-promoting, monotonous waste of money. And that's the ""polite"" version of my opinion. This DVD does not inspire me to do anything but shut it off before it annoys me further. It's a very long stretching session with almost no real yoga, and the ""meditation"" session is frankly jarring with these clanging bells that snap you out of any good place in which you might have had your mind.

Try YogaZone or any other beginners' yoga, but not this one.",1140393600,16,482,4.670588235294118
1972865,4,B00015NN94,I have never done yoga before. So I got this DVD as a start.  The poses/moves are all very relaxing and easy.  The instructor gives clear directions and goes over everything slowly.  It is a good video to have if you want to learn breathing techniques and simple but effective relaxation methods.,1137369600,10,296,4.653846153846154
8006886,3,B00015NN94,"I know it says beginner, I don't think all of the poses are beginner level. No complaints though it came very quickly and works well.",1442880000,,133,4.36
8006887,5,B00015NN94,"I selected this DVD by pure guesswork.  And it worked out well.

If you want something that's ""by the book"" yoga, go elsewhere.  But if you want a good stretch workout, this is a good DVD.  She mixes a bit of tai chi, a bit of dance and a handful of yoga for a good 50 minute stretch.  It's easy on the body, but very beneficial.  I enjoy it a lot.",1374192000,,348,3.8309859154929575
8006888,5,B00015NN94,"Men are the big winners with this yoga video.  It moves very slowly and she gives very complete and clear instructions with each pose.  I highly recommend it to anyone that has never done yoga, very stiff or men.  They will benefit from it like my husband has.",1361491200,,260,4.375
8006889,5,B00015NN94,"This DVD is exactly what it says it is for, extreme beginners.  It was perfect for me as just that.  I have had 4 back surgeries and working out with this DVD has helped reduce my pain and improve my flexibility greatly.  Do not pay attention to the rude comments on other reviews.  I found Evamarie's voice to be soft and kind and the music very relaxing.  This DVD is a great way to get you started in yoga with light stretching.  It is not too slow or too fast.  I have purchased another of her DVD's because I am so pleased with this one.",1360800000,,542,4.104761904761904
8006890,4,B00015NN94,"Heyla and well met!

This instructional DVD is targeted towards people, like myself, whose health, fitness, and flexibility levels are so low that many of the other DVD's targeted towards beginners are still incredibly too intense. For myself, I'm truly out of shape, overweight, and suffer from unstable knees, as well as many other medical problems. To give you an idea of just how out of shape I am, I can not even do a modified sitting eagle posture, as my elbows can not even cross themselves, my shoulders are simply that tight. I need instructional videos that are mindful of the fact that there are people who really can't do many of the basic postures that people of a more moderate fitness, flexibility, and health level really do take for granted. Hence, a video, like this one, that actually focuses on loosening extremely tight muscles is an incredible find, for me.

The few reasons why I give this video 4 stars, instead of the full 5, is because I would have liked to have seen many of the floor postures further modified for people, like myself, with severe joint problems that make being on all fours a very painful experience. I would have also liked to have seen a primer on the many ways one could safely move each part of the body and how to keep it properly aligned, before going into the actual postures, as there are many people who do not have this body awareness, and they may make the mistake of trying to muscle into a posture they shouldn't. Also, again, the knees and elbows are some of the most vulnerable joints in the body. Lessons on how to keep them properly protected while going into the posture would be greatly appreciated.

So, to sum up, if you are extremely out of shape, with incredibly tight muscles in key areas such as the hamstrings, hips, and shoulders, this video is where you want to begin. For those with other medical problems that make many of the postures difficult, you may need to look for other videos, such as those by Peggy Cappy, which guide you on how to modify many of these postures, even further. Finally, if your health, fitness, and flexibility levels are moderate and above, you'll likely find little use for this video. You're better off turning towards the beginner DVD's that true beginners will often complain about being too intense for their fitness level.",1303862400,,2330,4.650485436893204
8006891,5,B00015NN94,"I have to take issue with the ""yoga instructor"" who described the movements on this DVD as ""hyperextended and moving in very fast repetitive motion.""  Surely you are not talking about the same DVD as the one listed here.  I have used this DVD many times and have just bought a replacement copy.  After suffering a car accident with MANY fitness challenges, this DVD is SLOW AND GENTLE and is for EXTREME BEGINNERS, per its title.  So what if it isn't ""pure"" yoga?  I have had to trash ""pure"" yoga DVDs that were supposedly for beginners, because after about 20 seconds they are already into downward-facing dog which is NOWHERE NEAR what I am now capable of doing.  Evamarie's DVD is exactly what it claims to be.  The pace is SLOW, the tone is soothing and relaxing, and lets unfit people who are trying to REGAIN fitness feel like they've accomplished something.",1303430400,,864,4.644736842105263
8006892,5,B00015NN94,"The DVD, Introduction to Yoga:  Gentle for Extreme Beginners, is exactly what I needed as I began taking yoga classes.  Between classes it was difficult to remember all the poses and how to achieve them.  I do the workout on the DVD once or twice a week and find that it reinforces what I learn in class.",1241827200,,304,4.298245614035087
8006893,5,B00015NN94,"I think this dvd is great for beginners. In fact, I keep going back to this video because it's also very relaxing. So when I want to unwind or relax before bed, I put this dvd on. It may not be traditional yoga but alot of traditional yoga is too hard for beginners. It's certainly not the only dvd I would recommend for beginners but you won't go wrong adding it to your collection. If you're looking for a 10-minute yoga workout this is not the dvd for that.",1234310400,,460,4.179775280898877
8006894,3,B00015NN94,"I was hoping to use this video to get back into Yoga.  The music used was very nice, but the presentation is very slow and distracting - the outfit and makeup are not in my yoga comfort zone.  I never did get through to the end of it - between the pace and being distracted by her makeup!",1203897600,,288,3.9482758620689653
8006895,3,B00015NN94,"First of all, I just felt that the video was super long. I didn't really enjoy as much as I thought I would. Can't really say what made me become disinterested.",1183939200,2,160,4.193548387096774
