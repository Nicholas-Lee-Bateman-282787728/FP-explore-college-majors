4445356,4,B004QIG7CW,"What I Can Tell You: This is exactly the direction Disney should be going right now. I love the friendship, be strong, be proud, stand up for what you believe in theme.

The movie starts out with Stella, a new girl who is angry about moving and starting a new school a month into the semester.  She finds herself in detention where she meets four other freshman students. They seem to have nothing in common until, they start putting together a beat, each one bringing something different to the sound. Before you know it, they are a band.

With the help of a Lemonade Machine, a spirited music teacher played by Trisha Campbell Martin, and Stella with a penchant for being heard, the group play in front of their peers and are actually really good.

I loved the building of the friendships between the kids and how their problems seemed very real and not contrived. There is someone everyone can relate to; whether you are the ignored kid, the quiet kid, the overachiever, you will find someone who resonates with you.

Another surprised was that the songs were actually good! I didn't feel silly watching this and kids will undoubtedly appreciate the music. Catchy without the over saccharin of most kid friendly musicals.

Great movie!",1305417600,3,1238,4.734883720930233
4445357,5,B004QIG7CW,"I gotta say that I was definitely surprised when I saw this movie. I mean, I was expecting something like High School Musical so I didn't think I'd even bother seeing it, but I decided, ""What the heck, I got some time to spare..."" and I'm glad I did! This is a family, fun, feel-good movie that leaves you feeling empowered no matter your age and it encourages everyone especially kids and teens to be confident and not be afraid to chase that dream or take a chance. It really is just so entertaining and the songs are addictive! Can't wait to get my hands on this movie!",1304035200,29,572,4.305555555555555
4445358,5,B004QIG7CW,"My sister loved this movie. She says the movie is about a group of kids who get detention (Breakfast Club much???) start goofing around and discover that the makes great music together.

The story is cute and the music is pretty good.

My sister said she may even like this movie better than Camp Rock... Scandalous! haha :)",1303776000,3,324,4.568965517241379

4445368,4,B004QIG7CW,"Recently I had the joy of watching Lemonade Mouth with some of my friends. After trying to pick a movie for hours, we finally decided on the classic Disney original film Lemonade Mouth. As soon as the movie starts you are already imagining yourself as the lead singer in this new sensational band. As you watch you cant help but sing along to some of these catchy songs. These songs include hits like ""Determinate, More Than a Band, and Don't You Wish you Were Us."" This combines interesting characters and their joy for music in the perfect blend of a movie.

The reason why I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the unrealistic plot. You cant just expect everyone to learn the new song as you are singing it for the first time. I know this is part of every Disney Original Movie like High School Musical and Camp Rock but I guess I expected this movie to flow a little more naturally amongst the characters. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a great singalong movie that they can watch with some of their friends after a long day of school",1489363200,,1089,4.391089108910891

4445417,4,B004QIG7CW,"Not that bad of a movie as long as you can suspend your disbelief to get past some of the glaring oversights by the writers.  Take for example 1:32:57 into the movie, one of the guys has an electric guitar thrown to him, which for the remainder of the set apparently has a ""wireless"" pickup to the amp?  Come to think of it, the bass looked pretty much the same way, but I guess details like that are not really important in this movie.

4445420,5,B004QIG7CW,"The background of the story is an ego maniacal principle. This is a feel good movie because the kids won, not by rioting or burning things. but by standing up for what they believed. In today's society we have to many people that let the power go to their heads an act like that principle.

It's pretty clean compared to most of the garbage out there today and has a good message overall.  The kids realize they are different but find strength in working together and being creative.

4445462,5,B004QIG7CW,"Great youth community film--the kind where the youth form their own youth community.  This is a movie about loss and feeling the outcast (or not) and being talented and bringing those talents to the fore.  It's multicultural and multiclassism brought to its knees within the high school setting.  Equality (in the underlying human condition) is the substance of this oddly named movie, and the message is political--it's a movie about being allowed to be free, individual, and to formulate your own community from and within the human pool.",1396137600,,540,5.113636363636363

4445505,4,B004QIG7CW,"This is one of the most recent Disney musical movies, ala High School Musical and Camp Rock. This one centers on 5 high schoolers - 2 girls and 3 boys - that meet up in detention (all for minor infractions or misunderstandings), and end up forming a band. The way the band forms, and their instant musical chemistry, completely defies reality, but that's musicals for you. They end up competing against an existing popular high school band, and have to fight through the usual doubts and ostracization, as well as each having parental difficulties to overcome. As is typical in these movies, most of the adults are either cruel or clueless or both, which always bothers me a bit, but of course this is how tweens and teens often view adults, so that's partly a play to the target demographic. I do wish Disney would consider including some truly kind, engaged, insightful adults, so there was some model of kids turning to adults for help with their problems, but that may be too much to ask (it's one of the reasons I gave this 4 rather than 5 stars however.)

The music is more rock than others, and there is a 'question authority/stand up for what's right' theme that some parents might object too, although I personally felt it was handled fine. But other than that this is a fun, upbeat tween musical with engaging characters and music.",1330387200,,1341,4.6344537815126055

If anyone out there knows or is connected let me know if there are plans to release it or if its in the works as I have a six year old who desperately wants it on Blu!  Did Disney forget or are they gearing up for a Directors Cut double dip?",1322956800,2,363,3.958904109589041
4445508,4,B004QIG7CW,"This is a movie about a group of high school students who meet in detention after school. They discover they have two things in common: they all see themselves as outcasts and they all have a love of music. After some discussion, they decide to form a band. It's interesting how they come up with the name Lemonade Mouth for their band's name. Watch the movie and find out.

I want to point out that while I do enjoy seeing a Disney movie now and then, that is not what attracted me to this movie. The thing that did attract me to this movie was the fact that it was directed by Patricia Riggen. Her name alone was enough to make me watch the movie. And Riggen didn't disappoint me. There is a certain central theme or thread that runs through Riggen's movies. And that is that she likes to take a group of people who are looked down upon by others and she gives them a face and a voice and she makes them human. Then she makes us care about these people. She did this to perfection in her film ""Under the Same Moon"" which is one of my all time favorite films.

If you watch Lemonade Mouth, be aware that the movie does start out a little slow. But don't let that deter you from watching. The movie gets better and better as it progresses. I loved the diverse background of each of the students and how they stood up for each other and for their own beliefs. I'm not really big on musicals, that's the main reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead on 5, but this one is a winner. If you haven't seen it on TV, get the DVD and watch it. You'll be glad you did.",1320969600,,1559,4.125

Sure there are some things like kids spontaneously knowing lyrics to songs sung for the first time. I won't go into a couple of the other issues that will fly past you unless you see it five or more times like me. This is a movie for all ages. Don't think because it revolves around kids that adults won't get something out of it.
The genius in how the writers endear to you this many characters as well as reconcile some of their most pressing issues in a single 90 minute flick. It never seems forced like they are trying to do too much with the movie in the time they have to do it in. For me, it was brilliant.

So, I rented the movie on DVD and I have to tell you, I'm very glad that I did. I liked it so much that I ordered the DVD combo pack from Amazon.com the very next day.
This is a very fun movie, with lots of laughs and tons of heart, not to mention some awesome songs.

4445513,5,B004QIG7CW,"As an 18 year old guy, when first hearing about this movie, I thought it would be pretty bad, as many other Disney Channel movies are in my opinion.  However, I recently caught a few episodes of the show Good Luck Charlie, which I surprisingly enjoyed, and have since developed a *slight* crush on Bridgit Mendler.  When I found out that she was in Lemonade Mouth, I figured I might give it a chance.  Man, was I surprised at how well done this movie was.  Every time the band started playing a song, I couldn't help but tap my foot and smile.  The characters were very believable and it was nice to see some more serious issues in a kids' movie.  I have now found out that the movie was based on a book, and have done some research on it, and though Disney made many kid-friendly changes, I'm still quite interested in checking out the book.

The music is well written both musically and lyrically.  You won't find any corny High School Musical-esque lyrics in this movie.  Most of the songs are about friendship, perseverance, and standing up for what you believe in, which tie in with the overall theme of the movie.  The music is catchy, and the singing is pretty decent, though there is some obvious pitch-correcting at points. Overall, Lemonade Mouth is an excellent watch for the whole family to enjoy.

It does my heart good to see young people with talent and inthusiasim for what they do. Every cast member is perfect for their role. Often forgotten are the backup crew that did a equally great job. The choreography uses the talents perfectly. I think the only thing that has kept this from being ""bigger"" is the name, Lermonade Mouth"". It doesent draw some people that may have been High School Musical fans. In my opinion, this has better storyline and less of the burst into song gimicry.

This movie is proof that when brilliant casting meets talented actors and top-notch music and lyrics, you will definitely get a hit!  If you've seen any of these actors in their other Disney roles, prepare yourself for a whole new experience as you get to see a different side... one that showcases their musical talents.  The lyrics speak to teens and the music is addicting, so get ready to play this one over and over again... just like you would if you were a kid.  There is no age limit to enjoying this movie.

Highly recommended as a family night movie.",1307664000,2,269,4.36
4445522,5,B004QIG7CW,"It might be easy for the jaded among us to dismiss Lemonade Mouth as a TV movie attempt to launch another Hannah Montana franchise, this time with a full group, or to make the High School Musical lightning strike again. That may all be true to a degree; surely Disney Channel would welcome a new vein of gold, especially since so many of their series (Hannah, Jonas, Zack and Cody, Wizards of Waverly) are now in the rearview mirror.

But Lemonade Mouth is actually a solid little teen drama with music. The songs are more or less incidental to the story. Each of the leads has his or her own cross to bear and the film is about their journey through acceptance of their situations, not simply easy, Brady Bunch style solutions. They that also launch a successful rock band is perhaps preposterous, but their cohesion as a group is really the focus, not the showbiz glitz. It's not the dazzling Barbie-playset fantasy of Hannah or the recent Sharpay film.

And these young people are actually given roles to play, some rather complex. It is a credit to the actors and the director that they don't take the easy route of teenage overacting so common in teen dramas that it almost becomes self-parody (and was actually skewered on Sonny With a Chance, another Disney Channel series that has ended, albeit retooled as a sketch series called So Random).

I like this film much more than I expected to and so did my wife. My 13-year-old daughter adored it and watched it multiple times. But parents be warned -- this is not your usual pratfall-but-good-natured goofball Disney Channel fare. One girl is asserting her question of authority, a very natural course for the age group but still uncommon in this venue. But though these kids have fairly dark and realistic problems, it's all done with taste and restraint.

Ably heading the cast is Bridgit Mendler, skillfully carrying off a much deeper characterization than she is allowed to do on the broad sitcom, Good Luck Charlie. She reminds me of a young Audrey Meadows, or perhaps Victoria Tennant.

Christopher McDonald really should apply for a patent for the role he once again plays -- an insufferable, narcissistic glory seeking bureaucrat -- this time as a principal on wheels. His performance is a nice example of comic timing and lightens the mood as well as providing a foil.

And Mel's Lemonade looks like something I would want to buy if I could find it in a vending machine.",1307318400,4,2434,4.715294117647058
4445523,5,B004QIG7CW,"My original review was placed under the CD for this movie.  Not sure how that happend so thought I would try again. As a counselor who works with adolescents I usually end up watching certain movies because the kids in my office are raving about them. In order to converse at least somewhat intelligently, I figure I should view what they are so excited about.  Most of the time I understand the appeal simply because the movie in question plays to the tween or teen mindset.  This movie is a bit different.  It definitly plays to the tween/teen age group but it also has a more mature feel that is really engaging.  It is a movie the whole family can sit down and not only enjoy together but should also be able to initate a good family discussion around such important topics as self esteem, growing up, being true to yourself,and not having to be follow everyone else. Sure there are holes in the plot (hey its a movie; it's Disney)but the general theme is so well blended into the entire movie that certain plot twist that may not be plausible will be forgiven easily. Very few things bring families together on several different positive levels anymore.  This movie has that potential--a mature theme, a great soundtrack with upbeatand positive lyrics, enterainment that plays on young and older levels alike, and entertainment that gives families an opportunity to initate discussions that all famlies should conduct.
My only hope is that Disney does not burn out this cast. I work with teens so I get concerned for them. The teen cast appears to be a pretty nice and fun group of individuals. I hope the fame this is going to catapult them into does not go to the ego--which unfortunately has happened to many of Disney stars. (Teen actors' problems are legendary and well documented) Let's hope Disney and the families can keep everything in balance because these kids could be genuine long term stars and not fade as many teen actors do. I am sure a sequel and a tour will be in the works so I hope there are those who will help these young adults get through it all ""head wise"" and remain in tacked emotionally.

4445524,4,B004QIG7CW,"In 2007, Mark Peter Hughes wrote a fictional novel titled ""Lemonade Mouth"" about five teenagers who meet in detention and form a band despite the personal problems that these kids are experiencing in their personal lives.

Sure enough, a loosely-based film adaptation in 2011 was written by April Blair (""Monte Carlo"", ""Christmas Caper"") and directed by Patricia Riggen (""Under the Same Moon"") and premiered on the Disney Channel on April 15, 2011.

The film was watched by 5.7 million viewers and the soundtrack for the film debuted at #18 on the Billboard 200 chart and the following week, jumping up to #4.

""Lemonade Mouth"" is a film that revolves around five teenagers, each with their own personal quirks and have their own issues that they are trying to overcome.  One day, each of them got into trouble and had to serve a day in detention.  While together in detention, Miss Reznick (played by Tisha Campbell-Martin, ""Martin"", ""My Wife and Kids"", ""Rita Rocks""), she has the kids cleaning the basement in order to make it a music room.

While she gives principal Brenigan (played by Christopher McDonald, ""Thelma & Louise"", ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Requiem for a Dream"") a piece of her mind, for moving extracurricular activities (such as clubs, music and art) tot he basement of the school in order to make room for a gymnasium.

While the kids are cleaning up the music room, sure enough, the five start playing their instruments and perform with each other.  Each do a magnificent job that Mizz Reznick wants them to continue their music and form a band.

These five individuals at first are reluctant but because they all have their own personal issues, they all become good friends and form the band known as Lemonade Mouth.

But while they try to make Lemonade Mouth a success, the popular band in school, Mudslide Crush want to make sure there is no room for another band on campus.  How will the members of Lemonade Mouth respond?

""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" will be released on DVD and will come with a DVD and digital copy version of the film.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Lemonade Mouth"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1 - enhanced for 169 televisions).  The picture quality of the DVD is very good.  As expected with DVD, you can see some artifacting but for the most part, picture quality is good.

As for audio, ""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" is presented in English and Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack features a front and center-channel driven soundtrack with crowd ambiance being utilized through the surround channels.  While the dialogue is clear, the highlight of ""Lemonade Mouth"" is the film's music.

As one would expect from a Disney Channel film driven by its musical soundtrack, you can definitely expect catchy pop tunes, especially the song ""Determinate"" which is a pretty solid song and I don't know of which members really did sing for the soundtrack but if it was the actual cast, especially the female members of the group, they did a pretty solid job.  Also, for the guys of Mudslide Crush.

Once again, another Disney Channel film with a pretty solid musical soundtrack!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" comes with the following special features:

  Rock-Along - Rock with the band to all your favorite songs while watching the film.  During the music scenes, karaoke style subtitles are displayed on screen.
  Exclusive Scene - (5:31) The band members of Lemonade Mouth is interviewed for a television show.

EXTRAS:

""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" comes with a slipover cover case and a digital copy of the feature film which works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Lemonade Mouth"" is another exciting and catchy Disney Channel film that showcases teenagers and music.

While the novel focused on a story told by a freshman and some storylines being changed for the film adaptation, for the majority of the story, ""Lemonade Mouth"" still manages to contain the positive vibe of the film.  What one can expect is a group of friends taking on their own personal problems.  At first, these individuals had issues but when they get to know each other, they realized that they all have issues and together they manage to grow, become friends and each of them are able to take on their own personal challenges.

And these are stories that can easily relate to teens.  With Stella, being an activist and trying to fit in; Mo, is a girl who has a strict father and because of culture, she is unable to do the things that she wants to do; Charlie is a guy who constantly gets compared to his athletic brother and is expected to perform at that same level, even if he's not athletic; Olivia, being the shy girl who doesn't have her parents around and struggles with that, while Wen does have a family but can't stand his father dating a young woman.  These are problems that teenagers face and the film does take on themes of honesty, empowerment and expressionism but most of all, each of them overcoming adversity.

Sure, it's a musically-driven film like many Disney Channel teen films that came out but in this case, it was fun to have this ""Breakfast Club"" type of storyline  but to see these teens form a band and have fun together.  The musical soundtrack is very good and if there is one thing that I wished was included on the ""Extended Edition"", was the fact that it should have come out with a soundtrack like last year's Disney Channel film ""StarStruck"".  But you do get a digital copy of the film which you can watch on your laptop, iPhone, iPod or iPad via iTunes or Windows Media Player.

I do feel that ""Lemonade Mouth"", similar to ""High School Musical"" has the potential to grow and have its own sequel.  It's a fun series and because there are a good amount of characters to focus on, it would be cool to see the group move on to the next level and performing for larger audiences (as hinted on the ""extended music scene"" that was featured at the end of the credits and on the special features) and tackling a whole new set of fears and challenges.  And also, there are potential romantic situations that can easily be focused on in this film.

Overall, ""Lemonade Mouth: Extended Edition"" is another solid Disney Channel music-driven teen film.  The story was good, characters were fun and I enjoyed the musical soundtrack.

If you loved the film  or you missed it on the Disney Channel, definitely give it a chance!",1306195200,3,6420,4.780399274047187
4445525,3,B004QIG7CW,"People who have posted reviews here so far are reviewing the movie.  Yes, the movie was a lot of fun.  The tunes were catchy.  My son, wife, and I enjoyed it.  That's why I pre-ordered this from Amazon.  I was lucky and it arrived yesterday (the day before release) and we put it in immediately to check it out.

With all of the recent things the Disney Channel has done with this movie, we were excited to see the extras.  We especially enjoyed when they did the ""what's what"" edition where they had popups of jokes and info throughout the movie.  There were tiny videos of cast activities as well and this would lead us to believe that there was quite a bit of extra material to put in the dvd...we were wrong.

The video quality is, of course, fantastic.  I expected this from a dvd over watching it on cable.  Also, the extra ""High Wire"" scene is fun and you could see where it would be a nice epilogue to the move.  There was also a karaoke feature that allowed you to have nice big subtitles that only showed up during the songs.  These are some nice bonus features.  The problem is...that's all there was.

All the behind the scenes stuff, the popups, the interviews.  All the stuff they show on the disney channel...not there.  This is what caused me to bump it down to a 3 star review.  The dvd just felt effortless.  We love the movie...but we were disappointed in the dvd release.  Especially with the way disney's been hyping this for the past couple of weeks, I just expected more.  If you like to buy dvd's for the extras, keep your expectations low.",1306195200,33,1564,4.379790940766551
