Triple feature - King of Kong Island, White Pongo and Bride of the Gorilla.

My kid (of 7) and I watch these old movies and enjoy them.. usually.
This bunch of DVDs are in a lousy state - picture and sound wise - and you wonder why they were ever made. The quality aside, the actual movies suck much more than anything else I have ever seen. The suffer from being BORING (my daughter said).
The best special effects appear on the hologram gorilla picture on the box (not that I expected a lot of special effects).

I noticed it can be bought for 87 cents used. IT IS TOO MUCH.

For comparison the stuff we like are Tarzan (Weissmuller), Shazam, Superman (the oldies), Flash Gordon.",1195948800,,707,4.374045801526718
