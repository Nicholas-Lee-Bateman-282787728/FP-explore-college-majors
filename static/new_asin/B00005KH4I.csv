Very nice are the homerun derby's at the all star games with so many great stars.",1019433600,,208,4.358974358974359
8136158,4,B00005KH4I,"Great DVD.  From 2001 and some of the clips are even from the current season.  Cool tidbits, including a 5 minute evaluation of all of Ripken's batting stances (narrated by Cal himself).  I like the extra feature of the highlights from the previous 10 Home Run Derbys or so.  Also, if you're curious of the 'science' of baseball, there's a neat little extra feature on that as well.",1004659200,5,382,4.573529411764706
8136159,5,B00005KH4I,"After I enjoyed this DVD, what I would like to do is to find my bat to hit a homer right now. I illustrate that I launch a moonshot like Piazza. This DVD lets me have a nice baseball dream again!",1002844800,2,195,3.7804878048780486
8136160,4,B00005KH4I,"This tape has some of baseball's biggest stars like Mark McGwire and Cal Ripken, Jr.  Overall it is a good video that is entertaining and would be good to watch to get you pumped up before a game because of the music, the highlights and the fast pace of part of it.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five was because from the title and description is sounds like it is very instructional.  The players tell you somethings that work for them and how they have changed hitting styles as they learn over the years but it didn't really teach me anything about hitting myself.  So in all good video that was entertaining but not instructional",998352000,,644,4.38655462184874
