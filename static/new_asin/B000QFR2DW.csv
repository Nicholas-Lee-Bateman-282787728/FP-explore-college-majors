8196120,5,B000QFR2DW,"Currently, this DVD is unavailable in the U.S., but I caught it on my local PBS affiliate and was immediately scrambling to try to tape the second of the two-part series. Unfortunately, I failed so I'm here hunting for the program--unavailable. It is tremendously engaging intellectually and accessible, I hazard to suggest, to main-stream high school students in doses and older audiences. I caught myself imagining sharing this with my kids, anyway, as a way of figuring where you want to be in the world--and whose opinion, if anyone's, should matter. Not only is the writing excellent, the photography/cenematography is outstanding, making this as much about the visual as it is the audible. Please offer this DVD soon.",1207526400,5,723,5.135593220338983
