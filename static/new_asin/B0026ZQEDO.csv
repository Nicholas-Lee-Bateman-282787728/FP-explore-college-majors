8353813,1,B0026ZQEDO,"Aweful, too many chicks, bad filming a waste of money . Todd Verow, in my opinion made two good movies. Bad boy street was totally cool. Vocation land was fun, Something about Nothing.",1497744000,,184,4.606060606060606
8353814,1,B0026ZQEDO,"If you want a strobe induced seizure, you may want to watch these shorts! Other than that STAY AWAY!
Each of these shorts feature either really fast ""artsy"" cuts throughout, or poor out of focus or out of frame, or grainy video... You will want to vomit from motion sickness before the film finishes. No real story lines, or followable themes. The short about eating bananas, sounds provocative, but it really is just a bunch of people eating bananas...
There are some full nude shots and gay sex shots, but too fast, too cut, too out of focus, too artsy...
Don't waste your time or money! This is true CRAP!",1356998400,5,608,4.536363636363636
