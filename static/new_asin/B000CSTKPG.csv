CONTENTS:

CRAZE-- Solid cast in this British-made chiller. An idol-worshipping antiques dealer goes off the deep end and starts sacrificing humans to ""Chuku Mottram.""

THE DEMON-- A string of motiveless and gruesome murders by a person unknown adds to the terror of  potential victims targeted for the kill.

THE GLOVE-- Bounty hunter goes up against his most dangerous foe: a very big and violent man who kills with an equally large armor-plated police riot glove. Another strong cast here.

MEMORIAL VALLEY MURDERS-- Homicidal axeman sets his sights on holiday campers. Stars longtime TV actor John Kerry (no, not the politician!)

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
