2176580,4,B00068S3OQ,"The interaction between the family Rodney, his wife, and kids, is fun to watch.  The exercises are basic and adaptable to little ones - but my two children under age 4 were not really interested.  My 4-year-old loved it, though.  We enjoy doing it together.  It is a pretty decent work-out for a family video.  The setting is very pretty and the music is relaxing.",1273622400,2,364,4.538461538461538
2176581,4,B00068S3OQ,"This 40 minute DVD yoga class is a blast to play along to, whether you are with your family members or not. The energy is playful, fun and infectious.

The DVD takes place on a sunny rectangular stage right in front of the crashing  waves of Maui. The stage has enough room for their five yoga mats and is surrounded with lush tropical foliage. There is soft new age music and you can hear the sounds of the waves and birds during the presentation.

This practice starts with sun salutes, moves into standing poses, handstands, backbends, crow/crane and a variety of sitting stretches using straps. A savasana and sitting meditation complete the routine.

Rodney Yee, with his wife and three children, take turns demonstrating poses and leading sun salute sequences. They are a very cute family and giggle together a lot.

I can see where children from young ages to preteens can associate themselves with the kids on-screen as ""yoga teachers.""  Kids at home would probably enjoy leading their own families in sequences  - what a great confidence builder! Altogether, doing yoga as a family in this way should create fantastic bonding time as well as promoting strength and flexibility from a young age.

Couples without children can also enjoy this DVD. Lots of poses are shown using a partner to assist into arm balances, backbends and inversions. I showed the handstand section to my husband to help him get a feel for how to help me, and we did the relaxing coupled backbend together as well.

My main caveat is a big one - this is no DVD for beginners. Novices will be hopelessly lost during the fast-moving sun salutations. There is no instruction on basics like downward dog, upward dog and side plank pose. The sun salutes include a lot of jump backs and tougher transitions that Rodney and his flexible family take for granted.

Advanced beginners will be caught short by the inclusion of intermediate poses like handstand, upward bow and crow/crane.

Nowhere on the DVD package does it mention that this might not be appropriate for beginners. This oversight might get some people hurt!

For beginners who buy this program I recommend they go right to the standing poses, which have actual pose instruction and take things slowly. Skip the fast-moving sun salutes sequence. Try not to worry about getting up into handstand unless your kids are already athletic.

As the DVD does not have a section menu (just hit PLAY and off it goes), you'd have to manually fast-forward to the parts you want to use.

I wouldn't blame Rodney for the inappropriate marketing - this is a delightful practice and I appreciate that there's a family routine out there that isn't all just easy beginner's work. So there is certainly room in the market for a disc like this - for families already familiar with yoga, who want to get in some playful family time and help each other with challenging poses.

Ultimately, I found this DVD really quite enjoyable and will be adding it to my rotation as a short, ""fun"" choice.",1216425600,36,3008,4.76878612716763
2176582,2,B00068S3OQ,"I was hoping for something a little more creative, maybe playful, more FUN, more partner postures for more connection??? It was interesting to observe the family dynamics.  Beautiful backround but,overall, a little uninspiring.",1208649600,2,227,5.878787878787879
2176583,3,B00068S3OQ,Although this product was good for a basic yoga workout it is not as child friendly as I thought it would be. I did enjoy that the family took time to turns instructing.,1204848000,3,169,4.151515151515151
2176584,3,B00068S3OQ,"Although this video offers more fundamental Yoga instruction with respect to the Yoga Kids, Vol. 1-3 series, it lacks teaching many important basics to the adult beginner and has an odd selection of poses for the novice Yogi",1185926400,7,224,4.921052631578948
2176585,5,B00068S3OQ,"I'm a die-hard fan of Rodney Yee. This DVD although very different from his regular routines is absolutely fantastic because one get's to see another side of him which is truly endearing: him as a DAD.

I practice yoga everyday and my kids have always wanted to participate. The other routines I have on DVD are too difficult for them. This one allows children to be introduced to the basic poses in a fun and easy way. It's a great way to spend some quality time with the family",1178928000,13,479,4.382022471910112
2176586,3,B00068S3OQ,"Nice exercises. My kids liked to do them with me. Not a great workout for the parents, though, and more explanations would have helped.

But the worst part: It's poignant and painful to watch this now, knowing how Rod ""Stud-Muffin"" Yee dumped this wife, the mother of his children, for a willowy, blonde thing he picked up at a yoga retreat (after lots of other apologized-for infidelities, as reported in the NY Times).",1168300800,26,420,4.7534246575342465
2176587,2,B00068S3OQ,"I'm a beginner, and I bought this DVD to work out with my 4-yr-old daughter.

I was expecting a slower pace, simpler poses (hand stands are NOT simple to a beginner!), and very detailed verbal positioning and breathing instructions (presented by an adult, not a child). It was very distracting to have to look up at the screen while I was doing the poses.

My daughter enjoys other exercise DVDs and (unlike me) has joints like rubber bands, but she didn't like this DVD, either.

If you and your child are already experienced yoga practitioners, this DVD might work for you, but if you're new, give it a miss.

I hope Rodney Yee remakes Family Yoga DVD one of these days, because the concept has a lot of potential, and he has a demonstrated talent for making beautiful, soothing yoga DVDs. I wish this DVD had been presented in the style of, say, AM Yoga (which I received free with my yoga kit).",1136160000,80,898,4.49079754601227
2176588,4,B00068S3OQ,"This DVD is not for total beginners. You should watch it completely and then figure out what you think you can do with your children. This DVD is truely a gem but you just need to be careful when they do handstands, ect. It is about sharing Yoga exercises and bonding with your family. My little one likes to do about 3/4 of it and it gets a little hard for both of us at the end. The basic elements are there with out a new age feel (I personally like new age). It is relaxing, invigurating, challenging, and best of all you get to bond with your family.",1116288000,72,555,4.10091743119266

2176600,2,B00068S3OQ,"Many parents who ""do yoga"" are wanting their kids to get into yoga and sometimes, the kids simply want to mimic what they see their parent(s) doing (if they have a home practice.)  As a teacher, I wanted some guidelines as I was getting many requests for kids' yoga.  I do not have children (except my dogs!), so I needed tips.  This DVD was very disappointing.  Maybe if I had children, I would have understood Yee's approach. I found it boring and ineffective; otherwise, I'm a big fan of Yee.",1397779200,2,495,4.466666666666667

This is a great product for families wanting to connect with simple yoga stretches.",1365120000,,393,4.051282051282051
2176604,5,B00068S3OQ,Tiffany has a wonderful understanding of yoga poses and their modifications.  Her natural ease and quiet demeanor allow students of all levels to feel confident and comfortable.  She gives verbal queues that are simple and spot-on. Her fun approach focuses my children while stimulating their imagination. When practicing with the kids I discovered the gentle break it gives my dedicated ashtanga practice.  And the partner poses are a way to engage my husband whose heavy travel schedule doesn't allow him much time for himself.,1363737600,,529,5.273809523809524
2176605,4,B00068S3OQ,If you and your kids have some experience with yoga this is a fun workout.  My kids like it because the children lead parts of the routine and joke with their dad and the atmosphere is really relaxed.  We enjoy doing it together.,1362960000,,229,4.3023255813953485
2176606,2,B00068S3OQ,"This yoga program might be good for families where all members are already very familiar with yoga poses.

2176620,5,B00068S3OQ,"Tiffany is a lovely teacher and this DVD shows her love for kids, families and of course, yoga.
It is instructional and you can tailor it to meet every child's and your family's needs. You don't have to do every sequence or every pose but she presents an intelligent sequence and you can pick out what works for your own family.  We are not particularly bothered by mention of meat as all kids learn to be open minded and tolerant. Learning to embrace differences while sticking to their own values, that might be a useful lifeskill to take along as they grow up in this world with open heart.  I bet kids read and appreciate Green Eggs and Ham - by Dr. Suess for what it is - whether they eat ham and eggs or not. No judgements - that's what kids and family yoga is all about and Tiffany is one teacher we can admire for doing what she does with such grace. She's not a poser, she's real and warm like a ray of sunshine! Kids love her warmth and grace...and so do I.",1321747200,,967,4.193548387096774
2176621,5,B00068S3OQ,"My family and I thorougly enjoy this video.  It was simplistic enough for my children to pick up the poses quickly, yet still engaging for the adults.  My daughter and I love doing it together on Sunday mornings after a busy school/work week.  I am a teacher and plan to use it in my class with my 5th graders, too! I definately recommend this video for beginnners, children, or those getting back into their practice who want to share it with their children.",1315612800,3,459,4.506024096385542
2176622,3,B00068S3OQ,"I purchased this for the ""7 & under"" routine,

Tiffany includes a good selection of poses and the descriptive names for the poses are fun.
However, while she does tend to be encouraging, Tiffany is just not very engaging. I kept trying to imagine her demeanor as peaceful and yogic, but unfortunately she speaks through her nose a bit (does she have a cold?), and she comes off as bored, almost monotonous. (Just for reference, I'm not into overly bouncy instructors or forced cheerfulness, either!) Coupled with the somewhat poor sound & production quality (it's quiet and a little muffled), it is hard to understand the directions, especially when folded over or upside down! During the butterfly pose, she sings off-key.

A little note- while doing the ""sandwich pose"", Tiffany asks the children what they would like to put on their sandwich, and the first child says ""ham"" and then Tiffany has everyone put ""ham"" on their ""sandwiches"". This could be disagreeable to any vegan or vegetarian families (it was for me!)",1311811200,6,1019,4.9186046511627906
2176623,1,B00068S3OQ,"I have attended Rodney Yee's classes before, and i own 3 different dvds by him. I love his yoga technique--very talented. However i was  very disappointed in this particular dvd.",1301097600,,178,4.933333333333334
2176624,5,B00068S3OQ,"I had no idea how much my kids would like family yoga. Right from the menu page, it was a hit. At that point, it was the catchy and upbeat music that had them dancing around the living room. Once we started the video my daughters, 4 and 5, got right down to it and mimicked the kids that were on the screen. They pick one of the kids, call them by the color of their shirt, and then do whatever he or she does during the video.

My kids love all the gimmicks that Tiffany uses such as singing the song ""Butterfly"" during the Butterfly stretch, or making a sandwich during the hamstring stretch, or asking where they want to fly to during the Airplane stretch. They absolutely love the partner poses and always run to get me since I have three kids and they need a fourth partner.

The video has two parts, one that is for over seven and one that is for seven and younger. However, my kids usually do both parts that last about 50 minutes. The video is fast moving as the stretches aren't held for too long. But what keeps my kids' attention is Tiffany's ability to capture them through stories, questions, encouragement, and simple directions. I highly recommend Tiffany's Family Yoga as a way to get your kids to exercise a bit but at the same time, wind down and calm down.",1301011200,6,1275,4.308333333333334
2176625,5,B00068S3OQ,"This is a great dvd for families who want to practice with their kids, whether they are little or bit more grown up.  There are two routines - one geared for children under 7 and one geared for older kids.  I loved the partner poses - it's basically playing with your kids doing yoga and I was surprised by how focused and strong my kids were (and by the fact, they wanted to do the poses again and again).  Yoga is not competitive; it's not about getting ribbons or medals or having to wear uniforms.  It's about learning how your body moves, how your breath flows and how to build strength and gain flexibility all while having fun.  Because, if it's not fun and you are dong this with your kids, why bother?  There have not really been good choices out there for family yoga dvd's so I am so happy that this product is now on the market!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Yoga/dp/B004ISM3G4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Yoga</a>",1297641600,2,980,4.9815950920245395

I love their kids set up some of the poses for us, they were super cute! But it wasn't at all what I thought it would be, and they did not offer a lot of options for beginners. Like other reviewers, I expected this to be a little more fun. Perhaps even explaining the importance of breathing and meditation, how important it is to be calm during yoga.
 Also, I purchased this from Target and I do not understand why on the front they felt the need to put a little girl with blonde hair. The family was on the back, and I knew what I was getting, but I did not understand the reasoning behind the front cover.",1484006400,,736,4.006802721088436
