7334435,3,B011KME79Q,"Curve is a Survival thriller ,with very attractive stars. Those being (Julianne Hough) as  Mallory, a woman  travelling alone and ( Teddy Sears) as Christian, a drifter who helps her fix her truck.

It starts off strong as Mallory gives Christian a ride and a very provacative cat and mouse dialogue happens between them. He being the aggressor ,letting his psychotic, perverted intentions be known to her.

The film dulls in the middle as Mallory who crashes the truck intentionally is trapped inside but Christian escapes and taunts her as she fights the elements to stay alive. But that becomes somewhat mundane.

The last 20 minutes or so are very entertaining with Lot's of action ,surprises, a high volume of violence and some light gore. If you like survival thrillers or films about strong women ,you will probably enjoy this.",1453852800,5,834,4.928571428571429

7334438,2,B011KME79Q,"I'll be honest,...had this movie not included Julianne Hough, I would have received a ONE star.  However, I'm a sucker for Julianne.  Anyways, back to the review......

*******""Spoilers*******

This movie could have been good.  Unfortunately it lacked one key element.  Originality.  Basically this movie is what you get when you combine SAW with a driving element.  Julianne plays the roll of Mallory Rutledge, a soon-to-be-newlywed who is on her way to Denver in her fiance's truck.  While traveling (stop me if you're heard this before) the truck dies and leaves her stranded on the side of a mountain road.  Enter Christian Laughton (Teddy Sears) to save the day.  He gets the truck started and the two become acquainted.  Says he hikes through these mountains regularly although he still accepts a ride when offered.  (If you're hiking,...aren't you SUPPOSED to walk?!  I mean, it's the the sole purpose of hiking?)  After initially leaving him behind, Mallory feels bad and lets him hop aboard.

Not going to lie,..when Christian makes his first ""villainous"" remark to Mallory, I nearly spit out my fruit juice.  I should have known something was coming, but still, it caught me off guard and I nearly threw up from laughing.  Obviously, it is at this time that Mallory realizes her dilemma and attempts to remove Christian from the car.  Too late.  Once she fully understands his intentions, she attempts to crash her car OFF THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN!  Great plan.  Unfortunately for her, she gets stuck in the wreckage and he doesn't.  It's a game of ""live or die"" from here that not only takes that very line from the ""Saw"" series, but also offers Mallory a hacksaw to ""cut herself free"". Yeah, you can see what my earlier comment was about.

As I said before, had this movie not including Julianne, it would have gotten a one star rating.  Honestly, I probably wouldn't have watched it to begin with.  The acting isn't bad, but the overall story and complete lack of any originality was a deal breaker for me.

Final Verdict:  Watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-The-Complete-Movie-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00MFCPVO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw: The Complete Movie Collection [Blu-ray</a>] instead.",1453334400,8,2256,5.27887323943662
7334439,2,B011KME79Q,"Mallory (Julianne Hough) is traveling on alternate route 92 near I-80 in Utah. She is traveling from San Francisco to Denver to marry Brad. She seems to have doubts she won't admit to, and takes the scenic route. Her Ford breaks down and she gets help from a nice clean cut hiker, Christian Laughton (Teddy Sears) of 1419 Harriet St. Topeka, Kansas. At this point we can pretty much predict what will happen, including the ending, minus a few details.

For much of the film, it consists of Mallory trapped in a vehicle. If you like those one man formula films, this one has that going for it.

7334446,1,B011KME79Q,"Genre says HORROR, utter jargon I say! This movie was just...not worth it! Sick, is an understatement!!!

***Spoiler Alert***

Malory, is on her way to Denver in her fiance's vehicle (he loaned it to her for the trip) - we are not given an insight into who he is. Her sister, Ella makes a mixed tape for her - only song that plays is Roxette's Listen to your heart (you will hear this song play throughout the movie).

Malory comes to a crossroad, choices between going to Denver or not but she finally decides to take the route to Denver. She finds some trashy porno videos in her fiance's vehicle and decides to leave her engagement ring in the glove compartment (why be engaged if you are going to do this!!). Oh did I mention that her bridal gown was in the back of the vehicle -_-

The vehicle breaks down (on a deserted road) and she tries to ""fix"" it. She changes her shirt (basically half-naked) and that is when we meet Christian. He tells her that he is hiking - his dad usually accompanies him but his dad is now dead - he helps her fix the vehicle and she is on her way.

She feels guilty about leaving him behind so she stops the vehicle and that is when all the drama starts - Malory is an idiot (didn't her parents teach her not to pick up strangers). I mean he was cute but you are ENGAGED with your wedding day looming!

Christian makes a vulgar comment to her - she is fazed by this and asks him to get out. He pulls out a knife and tells her to keep driving. She manages to swerve the vehicle off the road and it crashes down the embankment and lands on it's roof. Her left foot is stuck between the door and she cannot break free. Christian is lying on the ground and she watches him. He finally stirs and ends up leaving her there to die.

This is a twisted movie - the part when she eats a dead rat and drinks her urine - I wanted to belch! It was sickening and I still cannot believe that I watched until the end - I was hoping for it to get better - live up to the Horror Genre.

So much happened in this film - like in the cabin with Bill & Sue & Katie and then the policemen - it would have made sense if the entire movie was not based on Malory stuck in the vehicle - also, what caused Christian to behave that way??? They show us a picture in his wallet - no explanation on him whatsoever!!!",1479686400,2,2319,4.081318681318681
7334447,5,B011KME79Q,"I actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie. A large part of it was due to Julianne Hough, however. She is an amazing actress and makes this movie absolutely worth watching. She adds such a real quality to her roles. The plot did a good job keeping my interest, I enjoyed that most of the movie was about her survival and not giving up. The ending was a bit rushed, but it was better than it being dragged out and unrealistic. I definitely recommend if you're a fan of Julianne or just a sucker for survival movies.",1475020800,,512,4.4

7334458,3,B011KME79Q,"Julianne Hough in a horror picture? Yep! And we spend a lot of time with her on her back in this one, as she plays a flighty bride-to-be on her way to the middle of nowhere for a wedding rehearsal. Of course, she experiences some car trouble, then she is helped by a stranger, and then she stops and gives the stranger a lift, and gradually comes to regret it...
Some hilariously nasty minded dialogue (it's not all that offensive, but it is funny) motivates a rather routine suspense-thriller with elements that are in many ways too familiar...if you've seen DUEL, BREAKDOWN, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, or DEATH VALLEY, or--you get the idea--then you sort of have an idea as to what you are in for. Still, Hough is very watchable, and Teddy Sears is suitably creepy as the villain. The ending is a bit too predictable, and when the revelation comes it really isn't that exciting, but all in all it does keep you watching. The script, by Kimberly Lofstrom Johnson and Lee Patteson, is pretty interesting for a movie that seems like it was in a hurry in terms of its production schedule, but (probably in Jason Blum's opinion) the more titles you can squeeze in per year the better!
The Universal DVD is pretty good for a movie that doesn't have any great consequence about its entry into the horror/thriller canon. Sadly, there is no audio commentary track, an item which might have boosted my rating by a star. But as is, we really don't know enough about the movie's origins to really appreciate it from the critical perspective. However, there is a fun ""alternate storyline"" extra, a feature which veers off the main road of the original (?) story and takes us somewhere else momentarily. For writers, this feature is quite interesting and worthy of an investigation, but there are no other extras of note. Still, I thought Julianne did a good job, and she comes off as being as sexy and as cute as always. C+

They are Teddy Sears and Julianne Hough, respectively, and both actors carry the ball CURVE's to-the-point story hands them and do not fumble.

As can happen in these how-do-I-get-rid-of-this-guy movies, you have to suspend your disbelief once or twice in CURVE.  But the film supports its cause with a good set-up, showing us what motivates the woman Hough portrays to take take literal and figurative detours.  You're too busy rooting for her to let a weak plot device distract you.  And while I am not going to blow the story I will say CURVE does not get silly in its final scenes, something that often happens in movies such as this, relying instead on one person outsmarting another as opposed to resorting to a dumb chases or fights that go on longer than the three Frazier-Ali matches combined.",1459123200,2,1034,4.748603351955308

With the help of a flood, Malory escapes been pinned under the truck (after several grueling days and night) after dueling verbally and physically with the psychopath.  Except for torturing a deputy with a nail gun, the film doesn't have much violence as other reviewers mention and certainly nothing in the way of action. Malory turns the tables on  the psychopath and rescues another female victim (no surprise there).

Yep-since there is absolutely no one who saw them together, it all happened in her mind.  Granted, she did crash, but all this time it was her fianc she was fighting against! Cue her going into cardiac arrest!  Since no one in the viewing audience knows what her fianc looks like; this could have worked in a hundred ways.  But to not hurt Mallory, yet hurt everyone else he comes into contact with, to suppose that Mallory was entangled by a simple wire; to suppose that pretty blonde chick stayed pretty and blonde after (did you lose count) 5 days and did she look good!  Why did the director make such a point to show us she woke up in the morning, she went to sleep at night...She'd been super dehydrated after only 2 days, with bugs crawling all over her, but she looked good, didn't she.
