646266,3,6303450938,"I first saw the movie in 1980 while a student at the Border Patrol Academy. I was trying to get an idea of what I was getting myself into. While the Border Patrol Agent's everyday on-duty life is not exactly as  portrayed in the movie, this is the closest video to reality that is on the  market. Charles Bronson is perfect for this role. In the movie, he is even  wearing an old hat that a Border Patrol Agent gave him for the part. The  USBP allowed the use of official emblems and badges and parts of the movie  was filmed at an actual BP station. Of the three or four Border Patrol  movies available, I think this one is the best.",942710400,28,634,4.155737704918033

646414,5,6303450938,Excellent action film. Excellent film about Border Patrol and the problems they face. Why their jobs are never ending and how little funded they are. Charles Bronson is great in this film with newcomer Ed Harris. Stable and consistent video and audio quality. Already had it on VHS and wanted to upgrade.

This film is lighter on the action than many of his other films, however; it brings light upon and addresses the issue of U.S. Border Security
in a fair manner.",1465689600,,303,4.392857142857143

646520,3,6303450938,"The plot is realistic. It's about the smuggling of Mexicans to the U.S done by a shady American group. It also involves murders. However, there is very little emotion. It's worth 3 stars.

I prefer other films starring Charles Bronson such as Mr. Majestyk, the Red Sun, etc.",1448409600,,274,4.708333333333333
646521,3,6303450938,"For over a decade we Charlie Bronson fans have had one glaring hole in our DVD/Blu collection his 1980 taught action/thriller Borderline which predated the similar and more popular Jack Nicholson vehicle The Border by two years. I used to own this on VHS years ago and though not a fantastic film, its not a bad little thriller (though a little TV-movie-esque at times) with a fantastic whos who cast and Ed Harris first major role.  When Shout Factorys subsidiary Timeless Media Entertainment (basically their bargain sister company) announced they would be releasing Borderline on DVD I became excited as this is one we fans desperately needed in our collection. Timeless Media is real hit and miss with their releases as <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sahara/dp/B00DOZNJWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sahara</a> and <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shout-at-the-Devil-Blu-ray-dvd-Combo/dp/B00D9EJFU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shout at the Devil (Blu-ray/dvd Combo)</a> were given beautiful widescreen releases but we fans will remember the Bronson vehicle <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Bullets-Russian-Roulette-Double-Feature/dp/B00DOZNJ1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love & Bullets / Russian Roulette Double Feature</a> was given a Full Screen/Pan & Scan release in a double feature with Russian Roulette. Sadly, despite what the Amazon information section says, I am afraid to say this is a Full Screen release.

The picture quality of the film looks to be taken from a 1 master tape source, which to people not well versed in the history of home video physical media, was the source used to make duplicates for VHS. This does not mean it is a VHS tape sourced as it looks better than a VHS transfer, but the image is soft and leaves a lot to be desired. Also even though it is Full Screen it doesnt look like too much was cropped off the sides for the Pan & Scan transfer. As for special features there is none, as in not even a trailer or scene selection. On the bright side they did use a slightly altered image of the original poster artwork for the cover which is always welcome.

Yes it may not be widescreen and the disc is bare bones, but at least the film has finally been released on DVD in a serviceable copy that is at least watchable. For us Bronson fans it is easily worth the $9.99 price tag.",1440892800,9,2432,5.585365853658536

646612,4,6303450938,"Solid action movie. Charles Bronson was the real action star, human, no beef cake and was beleivable as a character. This movie finally hit on DVD and i recomend it. Good storyline, a subject that is still hot ( Donald Trump ...someone !!!!).and no CGI or over the top special effect.",1440374400,2,284,4.588235294117647

646614,5,6303450938,I'm a big Charles Bronson fan. This movie is one of my favorites. I've been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd for a long time. It would've been better if it came out in a blu ray version.,1439856000,,195,3.7804878048780486
646615,5,6303450938,"By far the best portrayal of the U.S. Border Patrol and the work they do, w a couple of exceptions dramatized for screen value.

646617,5,6303450938,"Charles Bronson has always been one of my favorite movie stars. I love action movies, especially those with Charles Bronson. When I discovered the movie ""Borderline"", staring Charles Bronson, I couldn't wait until I could see it! The interesting thing about this movie is the fact that Border Patrol is currently a very hot issue right now in real life, and Charles Bronson does a great job portraying the chief in his role, overseeing the other Border Patrol officers.",1439078400,4,469,4.949367088607595
646618,3,6303450938,I order this movie for $14.99 now you can get it for $9.99 because is not on widescreen and picture quality sucks ...I'm not going to return it because I love Charles Bronson but next time I will wait at least a month before I order any new releases...,1437696000,,252,4.163265306122449
646619,3,6303450938,"Borderline has been a favorite of mine for years. It's not a spectacle, just a good, solid low budget movie.

However,  have to let you know that Shout Factory's DVD is not widescreen as amazon and most other online retailers list it.  It is 1.33.1 old time tv ""fullscreen,"" like an old tv show. Shout told me that was the only source material available. The bad aspect ratio info was an error on Shout Factory's part, one the tell me they are working to correct.

Anyway, still a good movie. (but if it shows up on amazon streaming or Netflix in 1.85.1 widescreen anytime soon, I'm gonna feel a bit cheated)",1437350400,,608,4.45045045045045
646620,5,6303450938,This Shout factory 2015 dvd release appears to have been taken from the original source. Nice clear sharp picture and great sound. I haven't seen this good of a copy since I saw the movie in theaters back in 1980. No special features but finally a good dvd copy. I hope someday it gets release on Blu-ray.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.,1436918400,7,348,4.4375

646675,4,6303450938,"I actually retired from the INS (now known under the name of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Home Security) and worked with former Bordere Patrol agents who fully understood the manner in which they had to deal with illegals coming over the border from Mexico and elsewhere.  In my talking with a few of my fellow former INS agents, the border station and how it functioned was basically accurate.  The storyline wasn't too bad and somewhat believable.  Bronson was fairly good and the agent in charge and not performing as ""gung ho"" as he usually did in many of his films.  I doublt if this movie changed anything regarding immigration problems, but it provides one of the move accurate and believable films dealing with the illegal immigration problem.",1399766400,7,773,4.9689922480620154
646676,3,6303450938,"This action-drama flick pertains to a United States Border Patrol Agent in Charge, Jeb Maynard (Chuck Bronson), who is forced to track down the killers of a young Mexican boy and his colleague and friend, a veteran Senior Patrol Agent, ""Scooter"" Jackson(Wilford Brimley).

Jeb Maynard is the Patrol Agent in Charge of the ""fictional"" Otay Border Patrol Station, located in the hills east of San Diego, CA. Otay Station is a composite of the actual El Cajon, CA and Brown Field, CA Border Patrol Stations.

He is helped by the young boy's mother, Elena Morales(Karmin Murcelo) and a rookie Border Patrol Agent Jimmy Fantes(Bruno Kirby).

This flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 8 years old in the 2nd grade during its theatrical release in the Fall of 1980 on Halloween weekend and when it came to HBO for the very first time back in the Spring of 1981, but I don't see what's taking them so long to put this Bronson flick on DVD, especially since all of Bronson's other flicks like 10 TO MIDNIGHT, DEATH WISH, EVIL THAT MEN DO, etc. are all released on DVD now.",1395014400,,1075,4.5595854922279795
646677,4,6303450938,"Charles Bronson emerges here as one of the true hard guys of the movies. A very intense and important thriller involving the illegal immigrant issue and everyone involved, from top to bottom. In 1979 about 1 million illegal immigrants were captured, and  Borderline captures all the intensity and detail involved. I would recommend it highly to anyone.",1384387200,7,352,5.175438596491228

646682,3,6303450938,I dig most Bronson movies anyway so I'm a bit biased.  A fav of mine from the 80s and I have not seen it since then.  What I want to know is why is this selling for $47 ???  Oh well I'll have to wait a little longer.  Sorry this was not a review but just me venting.  A movie I will get someday but just not right now for this price.  A good 3 star movie.,1200009600,,355,3.5454545454545454
646683,2,6303450938,Charles Bronson the man of action films was not his usual self in this  film where he plays a chief border patrol officer who investigates illegal  smuggling of imigrants led in by a sadistic killer played by Ed Harris(In  his Film Debut)Hotchkiss. Who is backed up by an corrupt american  bussinesman who uses these immigrants as slave labouers. Good story but had  the people involved with this project showed a little more dramatic  sequences to livin up the already bored viewer this could of been more of  worthwhile effort. Bronson tries hard to show more acting but it seems like  he rather blow some punk away with a service revolver like he did in `DEATH  WISH` As for Harris who had a little more hair on his head at the time was  a great villan but for the wrong film. It`s a shame his talent didn`t get  noticed until he did THE ABYSS in 1989. The film wasted time trying to  hammer into the audience`s minds the problem of illegal aleins being used  for unstable working conditons and lost any good dramatic impact from it.  There`s nothing wrong with bringing a message to the viewer but not at the  expense of the entertainment value.,968803200,5,1149,4.563725490196078
