8444291,5,B004W2JWA6,"This set is ""region 2"" meaning it normally won't play on a US DVD set.  But my iMac can read it and the VLC app has no trouble playing it so I'm a happy camper.  The set includes 10 DVDs, one for each year of the 80's, with 8 episodes per disk, 80 shows in all.  If you love Coronation Street you will want this set.  I think the older shows and characters were special!",1483488000,,370,3.8933333333333335
