5752749,5,B00CYQXCDK,"I have purchased all of the Californication series 1 through 6 and they all have their own distinct flavor.  The series is filmed in Venice Beach, California for 3 months in the summer and having read many reviews, the entire cast feels that the show is like play time and they all have such respect and love for one another.
David Duchovny was interviewed at the beginning of Season 4 and they all have committed themselves to making the show fun and serious at the same time. David has directed several of the shows and he was great and loved what he was doing for the series.
Season 6 was finally put up to purchase and Season 7 is the last and closing of the series.
Tom Kapinos,  gave the last season a beautiful closure for everyone and they are all on different paths at this point.  The finished season 7 last September..
Season 6 was watching ""Becca"" grow and move on to tour Europe and the rock and rollers were the best.  Maggie Grace was fabulous and a ""Muse"" for Hank when he needed her and then, of course, his true love, ""Karen"" refused yet another one of Hank's proposals of marriage, which broke his heart all over again.  Rehab and intervention and all of the other drama that takes place.
David Duchovny was acting his heart out and I have always loved his character, a child living in a man's body, and he portrayed it beautifully.",1395705600,2,1351,4.431451612903226

My wife and I enjoy this show , glad We could see It on Amazon Stream .I would like to see NEWIt on Amazon stream the next day ,so  I could buy It then.you see I will never have cable or a dish because it's all reruns Love Love Love for The Hank Show",1392249600,,348,3.64
5752751,3,B00CYQXCDK,"It's sad to see a great series like this one devolve into constant recycling of old themes and stock characters.  Each of the first four seasons had their own unique vibe, something that sets them apart from the rest of the series.

Unfortunately, these last two seasons have just been rehashes of things we've seen before, but without nearly the same amount of pathos or character building.  Also, Tom Kapinos and the rest of the writing team seem intent on outdoing the absurd antics of previous seasons, and while the show has always been farcical, it has reached the point where the preposterous goings-on elicit just as many groans as they do laughs.

Even David Duchovny seems bored with the part, and just goes through the motions with only a fraction of the charm and wit he imbued the character with in previous seasons.  Don't think for a second I dislike it now, the show is still good, and it's better than 90% of anything else on TV today. However, it's fallen far from the dizzying heights of seasons 1-4.",1381449600,38,1019,4.638888888888889
5752752,3,B00CYQXCDK,"The one thing that Season Six of Showtime's sex, drugs and writer's ennui sitcom CALIFORNICATION seemed to have going for it at its opening was the result of the almost-murder/suicide by one of Hank's many lovers (portrayed by Natalie Zea), and his resultant depression and alcohol-drenched daze he finds himself in after she dies.

It made me stop and wonder if perhaps the show might go slightly back to the roots that it laid for itself when Hank was still a pretty unlikable guy. That's what made the show such a wonderful thing in its opening season is that Hank Moody was not without charm and humor and heart, but at his essence he was selfish, immature, self-pitying and frustratingly childish. But, after about one episode, that idea is gone to make way for COMEDY! After all, it's not like this show feels like exploring the dark side of anything anymore. We have madcap rehab silliness, a ""man pretending to be gay"" story arc that is recycled from some of the worst rom-coms of the 90's, Hank begrudgingly writing a rock opera with a drug-crazed rock god, and, of course, a pornucopia of women willing to do anything with the men on this show for comic value.

In recent seasons though, all of those character flaws that define Duchovny's character have become virtuous and make him even more attractive to every other woman with the exception of Karen, the woman he actually does love. This season's primary paramour is that of Faith (LOST and TAKEN's Maggie Grace), a good girl gone bad that he meets in rehab for his alcoholism and drug addiction. Faith, a professional rock groupie and muse, is instantly annoyed with him, which of course means that she will end up falling for him in some way.

Of course, there's the various other people in Hank's life that make the show a little more bearable, such as the eternally funny Evan Handler as Charlie, whose name and likeness suggest a certain Charlie Brown-like quality; he can't really seem to get a break. This personifies itself most especially in a kind of mildly offensive way in the character of Ophelia (Janice Wheeler), who is a friend of his ex-wife Marcy (Pamela Adlon, stepping up her game considerably after last season). Ophelia is a horrifyingly intense and violent feminist author that suggests that even this show can't escape the ""comic"" trappings of having a feminist character be a caricature of some form. She's so extreme that it suggests the real-life version of the feminist book store owners that Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein so hilariously send up in PORTLANDIA.

Don't get me wrong; the show is still watchable and somewhat fun, but it's gone so far from it's original mission statement that the show really only exists to showcase the depths of stupidity and depravity that only L.A's rich and shameless are willing to stoop to.",1379721600,21,2826,4.7967145790554415
5752753,5,B00CYQXCDK,I don't understand Showtime. The show airs in HD. Why the hell would anyone want to buy it on SD DVD? WHY do they refuse to release a blu-ray for this awesome series!?,1379462400,,167,4.090909090909091
5752754,4,B00CYQXCDK,"This is one of my favorite series, every year I wait for the season to start and devour the episodes, having many laughs in the process. In this season, we start with Hank waking up in a hospital after almost dying from the overdose Carrie administered him. The stint in rehab is interesting and provides us with many funny moments, but even more importantly, Hank runs into Faith, a mysterious young woman who seems to hate him on sight.

This season involves several different topics, rock stars, groupies, Becca's growing up and her hopes and interest in experimenting life, and a wacko that hates men among many others. We definitely are kept engaged throughout the season. There are a couple of cases in which the writers seem to be trying too hard to come up with new material that shocks the audience (i.e. Hank drinking his own urine), but overall they do a great job.

The aspect that left me a little disappointed is that no matter how much the story moves up down and sideways during the season, we always seem to end up in the same place, and that is getting a little frustrating. If you are fine with continuing with the status quo, then you will love this season, but if you are like me, you may be losing your patience a tiny bit and want the writers to get going already. I don't care which way they want the story to go, just make it go somewhere.

As you can see from my rating though, this series has so many aspects that are positive and better than everything else out there that I can't judge it too harsh when it's time to give it the final score. Still one of my favorite shows, but I wish they would exploit their abilities and made it even better.",1371945600,23,1673,4.390322580645162

As the author of the book listed above - I can tell you that this show (Californication) is so accurately written and depicted with the ""scene"" that is show business, rock-n-roll, and other, successful, artists' lifestyles that it is (literally) like I'm reliving the part of my life that my book covers (the book is a memoir).

I, highly, recommend Californication to anyone who likes to laugh while reliving or living vicariously through the show. It's a welcomed trip down memory lane, for me, of a time in my life filled with a lot of money, concerts, musicians, parties, infidelities, but most of all - adventurous fun.",1484265600,,791,5.878260869565217

5752813,3,B00CYQXCDK,"This is the season that the previously amusing and highly watchable Californication jumped the shark. After already having done a ""rock star"" season (S2 with producer Lew Ashby) and an ""artist crossover"" season (S5 with Samurai Apocalypse), was there really a need to do a ""rock star crossover"" season with the lame and annoying Atticus Fetch? The writers could have come up with a new angle to keep the show fresh and moving forward, but instead chose to rehash old themes and give us essentially nothing new, only done more predictably and poorly. The whole Karen/becca storyline also goes beyond believable by this point and becomes intolerably dull. If you were a fan up to now, do yourself a favor and skip the last two seasons - they're pretty painful *muthaf*cka!*",1470960000,,771,4.893129770992366

5752832,5,B00CYQXCDK,"Not as compelling as prior seasons in many ways but with an incredible through story line about a rock groupie. It started slowly but culminated in as poignant a series of moments as I've ever seen on TV or in the movies.

With a couple notable exceptions Californication has relentlessly and persistently portrayed interesting and novel life situations in ways that are utterly believable. The writers' insights into the varieties and vagaries of the human mind and its incredible complexities is as good as anything I've ever seen or heard anywhere.

5753261,5,B00CYQXCDK,"Hank Moody appears and Duchovny disappears.  Californication is really an ensemble show, yet at the heart of the ensemble is Hank Moody. Quick witted, at times hilariously crass, always has something pithy to say about anything: In my opinion one of the greatest characters to have graced the TV screen.

Tom Kapions, creator and executive producer, as well is Duchovny an executive producer, together they have brought into existence a slice of stylized reality.  Quite often Kapions writes the scripts for each episode. And does it well.  If fact, perhaps he is the best screenwriter in the business today.

Each character in his or her own right is memorable. Each in his or her own way is quick of mind, sharp of tongue and always either vulgar or crass.  Sex and private-parts of the human body are rhetorical tools by a character conveys his or her particular perspective.  Witty banter between characters is the norm more so than an occasional occurrence.  No matter who is speaking, pithy, authentic sounding insights about life come issue from a characters mouth. For example: A featured character is season six is a rock and roller named Atticus Fetch. Here is a quick exchange between him and Hank.

 Atticus: There are elements of the body that need to take flight.  Ejaculates just one of them.

Hank:  Thats what masturbation is for.

Atticus:  -Ew, No.  Masturbation?  Masturbations for the poor, the downtrodden.  The silent un(f-wordables).

As for season six as is the case with each of the seven seasons, Californications entire showing on Showtime is consistently excellent.",1436227200,,1594,5.038314176245211

Plot elements are added this season for no apparent reason. I certainly don't see them as necessary and they only served to reduce the amount of time that the two main arcs of the show were given (Hank/Karen and Hank/Becca). I would have rather gone in depth in what I had invested in over the previous five seasons than see quick and minimal plots involving other parts of Hank's past that ultimately don't factor into the show's ultimate conclusion.

The show lost its way in season 4. And season 5 was a major disappointment (I was really looking forward to Tim Minchin).",1424649600,,650,4.643478260869565

Though the last season wrapped up nicel y, it seemed as if they simply ran out of material. David Duchivney's character ran out of steam and became predictable inthe last few seasons-though he did well with thin material.

Hank has been down the rabbit hole for six seasons now, and each time he tries to find buoyancy,
the world around him conspires to pull him back into its nihilistic embrace.

Some might say he is to weak to change. I think Hank sees the ills of the world and thinks, ""Why even bother.""
The bottom line is, Hank does try to live by his own code. He loves his daughter, and caries for his true love and muse
in a land without happy endings.

I find it to be a fascinating ride and a cautionary tale.",1410393600,,580,4.123893805309734

This transition from year to year is like seeing everything through Karen's eyes. It is all fun in the beginning and you like Hank. However, as the seasons wear on, you just start getting tired of what a total screw up he is and it all gets very old.",1409702400,2,419,4.3164556962025316

There doesn't seem to be any direction in any of the people's lives in the show. As story arc's go, it's spot on scene by scene, but the overall arc seems to never peek, nor does it ever seem to head towards it's conclusion. I've heard that season seven will be it's finale, so maybe we'll get some closure in it, or it will continue to just spin in a Hollywood loop. Meanwhile, it's still a funny show with plenty of insanity to keep you entertained.",1409356800,,605,4.269565217391304

5754120,5,B00CYQXCDK,"Positive: Some episodes are excellent.  The dialog is witty, the characters well defined, and the plots/subplots are usually good.

Negative: The writers after six seasons, have finally spelled out the true character of our hero: He is definitely not a writer, he is a hardcore alcoholic.  And drug addict.  Yes, he did in the beginning of the first season write a novel, maybe two.  And since episode #1, he has written maybe three screenplays over the next five years.  That does not constitute a productive writer.  The only brilliance he displays is his fairly witty banter with other characters.  It is false advertising to bill him as a talented writer.  He is a drinker, not a writer. (Oh, when he does write screenplays, he drinks at the same time.)

Also, the series major plot of his trying to get back with his ex girlfriend & mother of his child, after six years is no longer romantic, it is pathetic.  According to the storyline, they have been ""together"" for 20 years -- yet have never been able to make their relationship work.  The storyline lacks believability when the main characters haven't moved on.

The writers had an excellent chance this season when they introduced Maggie Grace as a young, beautiful Muse -- the season could have ended on a high note.  Instead, he dumps her to go back to his ex girlfriend (AGAIN!) -- who has never been his Muse and does not help him write.  She only enables his drinking and sexual infidelity.  This is a  poor plot structure.

Maybe Season 7 (the final season) will be better.  But don't hold your breath, the writers have run out of ideas.",1407628800,5,1603,4.660714285714286

Hank Moody is the modern day Holden Caulfield, awash in substance abuse, self loathing and sex. he wanders aimlessly from hilarious encounter to hilarious encounter.

Hank struggles to remain connected with his now adult daughter who to his horror is rapidly turning in to him and continues to attempt to integrate himself into the life of his true love Karen.

5754140,1,B00CYQXCDK,"What I find particularly disturbing about this episodic immersion into the dark depths of depravity is the casual if not concealed manner in which lines of unambiguously blasphemous content is woven into the foul fabric of the dialogue in such a way so as to leave one contemplating whether or not to smile at some non-blasphemous contrivance of comedic intentions before even realizing that they just referred to God (again) as though God was created in hedonistic Hank's sex-addicted image (and sexplicitly sexualizing the Universal Creator in increasingly perverse ways is not something this God-knowing faith-child of the Supreme Being finds to be even vaguely funny). In the grand scheme of things that is etched upon the master blueprint in the multi-layered mind of God, it doesn't really matter what I think about this pessimistically pathetic pool of God-hating bottom-feeders who excrete the blasphemy-stained fruit that oozes forth from the lower extremities of their script-producing black holes in such a despicably disgusting way that even now fills the crumbling cave of Californication's soon-to-be-cancelled show with the decaying echo of what it sounds like to hear a legion of literary losers commit mass spiritual suicide one unspeakably unholy syllable at a time. I mean it's pretty easy to figure out that I am not exactly a fan of spiritually-dead writer-whores who freely choose to spread wide the wobbly legs of their vacuous minds to spasmodically spew forth countless pages of grotesquely descriptive depravities that might gag Lucifer himself. What is far more important than any of that is that each of us let God as we understand God re-write the evolving scripts of our preliminary mortal existence so as to lead us by the lure of love alone into yet another season of continuing progress and adventure that lies just beyond the closing credits of our final scene upon this earthly stage of our shadowy discontent.",1401580800,,1945,5.177777777777778

5754224,3,B00CYQXCDK,"We've anxiously awaited ever seasons release of Californication and never been disppointed until we watched season 6.  Some of the episodes are pretty good, but the episodes where ""Atticus Fetch"" is featured are definately not to my liking.  Granted, this show isn't probably for mainstream consumption (as in primetime fare), but Atticus is just an unlikeable, nutty and vile character that in my opinion doesn't add any interest or laughs to the show.

While we've totally enjoyed the characters Hank, Karen, Becca, Marcy & Charlie, and all the situations they have found themselves in over the entire series, this season has kind of left us high and dry and rather disappointed by some of the over the top things that have gone on.  It just seems like the writer(s)  have decided to forsake some creativity and instead just see how far over the top they can go to create shock value.  I'm not prudish at all (can anyone who enjoys Californication be prudish ???), but some of the storyline and newer characters this season are just plain stupid and not funny in my opinion.

I think I read that next season (season 7) will be the last season ?  If so, I just hope it goes out on a high note rather than a low note like season 6 has been.  Just my opinion !",1397520000,3,1259,4.56

5754227,5,B00CYQXCDK,"Much of the whole series up to Season 6 Episode 9 showed - even with all the allusions to Baudelaire and Oscar Wilde - and beside some really good, contemporary comic entertainment, which is of course no little feat - little dramatic tension other than beautiful people who spend years following pursuits that have nothing (or little) to do with their true potential and their fraught efforts to recreate themselves, becoming the people they truly want to be. Understood - this is the bases of all comedy! But to often - and maybe understandably - clichs are invoked in an attempt to drive the point home. However, Episode 9 of Season 6 all of a sudden surprises with a spectacular U-turn. Here magically the viewer, in explicit but still subtle ways, is invited not just to consume some more 'outrageously' entertaining behavior but to actually do more: to witness a philosophical shift. The script becomes real and direct in its message. The iconoclastic and over long parts cynical belly-view of this Hollywood production all of a sudden turns into a powerful illustration of Nietzsche's foundation of existential thinking: ""The whole history of a 'thing' (in our case the true nature of a [love] relationship)... can to this extent be a continuous chain of signs, continually revealing new interpretations and adaptations, the causes of which need not be connected even amongst themselves, but rather sometimes just follow and replace one another at random"" (Genealogy of Morality).
As viewers we are taken out of the dull role of simple consumers and are called upon to do our own work by keeping the future (of the story being told - and of any love relationship for that matter) open and infinite by accepting even multiplying interpretations, so that we are not (emotionally or morally) bound to just one of them. Or as Nietzsche formulated it in Essay III of the Genealogy of Morality: [...] ""As knowers let us not be ungrateful towards such resolute reversals of familiar perspectives and valuations. ... To see differently, and to want to see differently, is no small discipline and preparation of the intellect for its future "" objectivity"" - the latter understood not as 'contemplation without interest' (which, as such is a non-concept and an absurdity), but as having in our power our 'pros' and `cons': so as to be able to engage and disengage them so that we can use the difference in perspectives and affective interpretations for knowledge.""

As I said - no small feat at all!",1396656000,,2495,4.912322274881516

What I am impressed with is the presentation and quality in this set. Finally, CBS/Showtime has put these shows on dual layer DVD9 discs. Previous series were on single layer discs. Not only that, but on many or all of the previous series, the episodes were duplicated on the discs so if you watched the episodes one by one, that was one title, but if you watched them in ""play all"" mode, that was a different title, so while disc 1 says it has 8 episodes on it, it technically had 16. The quality suffered. The episodes looked like remastered VHS tapes. Here, each episode is on the disc only once so the video and audio quality are higher. Thank you CBS/Showtime!

5754230,3,B00CYQXCDK,"It's sad to see this once great show sink so low, into re-runs & tired sub-plots. I can't believe there will actually be a 7th season!
The first two seasons were classic! The only reason fans keep watching, is that the Hank Moody character has a lot of funny lines.

Californication is completely out of touch with reality at this point. Hank collaborates with an egotistical rock star (hmmm, sounds familiar--Season 2), who is played by a wannabe Russell Brand, except less talented, and if possible, more annoying.
The show should take place in the '90's when hard rock/metal stars ruled LA during Guns&Roses heyday. Now in 2014 it seems ridiculous to have all these leather-clad, big-haired rockers talking about record albums, as they lie around in coke-fueled, sex orgies. Sure, that stuff still happens, but the music scene & look has changed in the last quarter-century. Then we have the ""Runkle pretends to be gay"" sub-plot, which is funny for 5 minutes, but they keep beating the dead horse.

Part of the success of early seasons, was that Karen was married, so Hank yearned for her love, but still caroused and got in plenty of trouble. I actually miss Karen's husband, and her manipulative step-daughter. (However, Karen as a former bartender at CBGB's is completely unbelievable. Do the writers/producers live in an LA bubble?) Both actors are needed. Marcy is just not that interesting, and the writers seem determined to have the characters say c#ck or v#gina as many times per episode as possible, to where it's not shocking or funny or anything anymore. How many times can you bear to see Runkle run around naked? This season is very predictable. If Hank gets in a fight with some man, a few episodes later they will be collaborating on a movie/screenplay/book and doing drugs together. If Hank meets a woman who hates him or is not interested, a few episodes later they will be in the sack together. Zero character development.

There are funny lines and, as usual, plenty of nudity in this season, but lower your expectations. This show should have ended after the 4th Season. Last person watching the show, please turn the lights out. I didn't even finish Season 6, and I'm bailing.",1395964800,5,2201,4.83289124668435
