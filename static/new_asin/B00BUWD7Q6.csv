5676754,5,B00BUWD7Q6,"I would have to say that by now, Mill Creek Entertainment must be one of my favorite DVD releasing companies. Sure, they started off with public domain movie packs that were not remastered in any way, but the prices were impossible to beat, and helped some of us to discover some truly hidden gems and some films that have never been released at all on DVD before. But Mill Creek refused to just be a public domain movie outlet. They've continued to grow, and their releases have become better, transfers have become much nicer, and the movies they've got hold of are more popular, and more recent. That's the thing about Mill Creek that lets me rank them up there with the best. They have no intentions of resting comfortably with what they've already made money on. They want to continue to entertain, and they want to do it at a price that everyone can afford. The only fault I can give this set is that it should have been called ""Horror Hits"", instead of ""Hollywood hits"". Here's a brief synopsis of each film.

The Return of the Vampire

Bela Lugosi rises from the crypt in this horror classic! In 1918, Armand Tesla (Lugosi), a 200 year old Hungarian Vampire, prowls the English countryside, feeding from the jugulars of the villagers. But Tesla's reign of terror is interrupted when a pair of scientists, Lady Jane (Frieda Inescort) and Sir John Ainsley (Roland Varno), drive a railroad spike through his heart. The ""un-dead"" Tesla remains safely entombed for two decades until the impact from a stray Nazi bomb accidentally releases him. Along with his werewolf servant Andrea Obry (Matt Willis), the resurrected vampire now plots vengeance on the family that put a halt to his nocturnal feasting.

The Revenge of Frankenstein

Peter Cushing (Star Wars) reprises his famous role as Baron Victor Frankenstein in this horror classic! Rescued from the guillotine by his devoted dwarf Fritz (Oscar Quitak), the Baron relocates to Carlbruck, where he becomes a celebrated society physician, Dr. Stein. But under the guise of charity work, the good doctor continues his gruesome experiments, this time planning to transplant Fritz's brain into his latest creation: a normal, healthy body (Michael Gwynn). Widescreen 1.66:1/Dolby Digital English 2.0

Mr. Sardonicus

This creepy horror classic is based on a novella by screenwriter Ray Russell (X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes), and is brought to life by William Castle (13 Ghosts), master of terror! Desperate to retrieve a winning lottery ticket, a greedy baron unearths his father's corpse. An enormous jackpot is his reward, but not without a price - his face is frozen permanently into a hideous grin. He enlists his fiendish one-eyed servant to help him lift this horrible curse, but their schemes fail. Finally, he turns to a noted neurosurgeon - and his wife's former lover - to cure him. Widescreen 1.85:1/Dolby Digital English 2.0

The Brotherhood of Satan

Children are mysteriously disappearing, their parents are being violently murdered and strangely enough, no one has been able to leave! When their car stalls, Ben and his family are stranded and are forced to join the sheriff, a priest and the prominent Doc Duncan in trying to unravel this frightening web of events. Suddenly, KT disappears, triggering a frantic search that results in the startling discovery of a deadly coven, led by Doc Duncan himself! Ben and the others must make a desperate attempt to stop these witches from performing a satanic ritual that transports their malevolent spirits into the innocent children - thus creating yet another generation of satanic worshipers! Widescreen 2.35:1/Dolby Digital English 2.0

In my humble opinion this is the best 4 pack that Mill Creek Entertainment has released. You get four great films from Colombia Pictures (and one is even a Hammer Film). All the transfers look great for the years represented, and the audio is crisp and clear. Mill Creek has stepped up their game. If you haven't purchased anything from them yet, make this your first!",1375660800,6,4067,4.986725663716814
5676755,4,B00BUWD7Q6,"I've been a die hard horror fan since around eight or nine-years-old, which I don't recommend for anyone at the age, but I somehow connected with scary films, good or bad. I was more than excited when Mill Creek Entertainment recently released four classic Columbia Pictures horror movies onto a 2-disc set, which I received free of charge in exchange for my honest review.

The most famous Dracula movie was the 1931 version starring Bela Lugosi, which launched a franchise for Universal Studios; though Bela only appeared in one film (I'm not counting the Abbot and Costello movie). He returned as a Dracula-like vampire named Armand Tesla in the 1943 The Return of the Vampire. The movie was attended to be a direct-sequel to Dracula, but Columbia Pictures didn't own the franchise, therefore the character's name was changed. The plot focuses on two scientists driving a railroad stake through the vampire's heart. He is entombed for nearly two decades, along with his werewolf servant, A Nazi bomb frees him from the tomb and he takes revenge of the scientists' family. The movie is a pretty good vampire flick, much better than the campy Universal Studio's sequels.

Columbia Pictures released a Hammer Film's The Revenge of Frankenstein in 1958, which was a sequel to The Curse of Frankenstein. Baron Victor Frankenstein (played by Peter Cushing) barely escapes the guillotine. He moves to Caribruck, takes the name Dr. Stein, and begins a new profession as the local physician for the rich. Behind closed doors; the doctor is secretly transplanting Karl the hunchback's brain into a normal body. Of course things go terribly wrong. This is the best movie out of the Hammer Frankenstein films (there are seven total).

In 1961, the director William Castle brought the Mr. Sardonicus to the big screen based on the novella by screenwriter Ray Russell. The plot focuses on Marek Toleslawski as he digs up his father's corpse as it holds a winning lottery ticket, but a dreadful curse is put on him. He seeks help from his servant and a neurosurgeon, but nobody can help him as he is cursed for life. I thought I had seen most of Castle's movies, but I had never seen this one. It is a weird movie with several different plot twists.

I have never heard of the low-budget horror The Brotherhood of Satan, which finds Ben, his girlfriend and his young daughter coming across an automobile accident near a small town called Hillsboro. It seems there have been strange happenings all over town. There is a secret witch cult controlling the children, so the cult members can one day inhabit the children's bodies. This is a bizarre and confusing movie with a few creepy scenes.

The Return of the Vampire, The Revenge of Frankenstein, and Mr. Sardonicus are classic horror films that I enjoyed watching and I recommend to other horror fans. The Brotherhood of Satan has its moments, but is mostly weird.",1368921600,8,2903,4.868421052631579
5676756,3,B00BUWD7Q6,"It's pretty stunning to see a classic picture of Bela Lugosi ready to have dinner (or is it breakfast) on the throat of an actress in a trance!  But that's the first thing that caught my eye about this 4-Horror Feature Package.  Unfortunately, all 4 have little to do with one another!

Let's start by admitting that RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE + REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN were released as single DVDs while MR. SARDONICUS & BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN were available in a combo pack.

RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE (1943) is probably the strongest title of the four.  Lugosi is portraying Dracula, but due to Universal's Copyright on the name: DRACULA, Lugosi has become Armand Tessla. And yes he has a werewolf by his side (Matt Willis) along with a scientist/mother-in-law trying to keep Lugosi's teeth away from her future daughter-in-law.  The picture makes several references to the war...""Here come the Gerrys!"" Lugosi takes his part seriously and my overall grade is B+ [Do you suppose that brief scene of a German pilot was actually Bela as a bombardier]?

REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1958)...Peter Cushing returns as Dr. Frank (or is it Dr. Stein)?  Anyway, Michael Gwynne puts on the boots and steps into the part that Christopher Lee played in the original (""CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN""). Peter Cushing and the atmospheric Hammer Production Values are the reason this film has survived.  It gets a B!

As for MR. SARDONICUS and BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN, both of these are pretty weak!  True, actor Oscar Homolka does his best at playing the servant to MR. SARDONICUS, but the film is clearly dated. The conclusion is moderately satisfying.

Only 'The Lord of Darkness' knows why BROTHERHOOD OF SATAN was made in the first place? Rumor has it that there are still cults that believe in 'The Fallen Angel?' But if you happen to be involved in one of them...you'd probably find BOS amusing?

Anyway...I give the last two films a C for a good try...but...?  And that's the reason this entire package is only *3 Stars!*

There has got to be better Hammer/Columbia Product out there? Perhaps whoever put this mess together is saving the good titles for...err...HALLOWEEN???  One can only hope...",1368057600,,2166,4.8931506849315065

8574298,5,B00BUWD7Q6,"There are three aces and a joker in this hand. First off, Bela Lugosi's third appearance in fang and cape is a worthy follow-up to ""Dracula."" MGM's ""Mark of the Vampire,"" which also featured Lugosi in a supporting role as Count Mora, was dated at the time of its release. Being a remake of Lon Chaney Sr.'s long-lost ""London After Midnight,"" it is enjoyable up until ""the reveal"" whereas ""Return of the Vampire"" really delivers. By the mid-1940s, Universal Pictures' horror output had lost its bite, but Columbia Pictures stepped in with this winner. Lugosi's Armand Tesla is a bravura performance and reunites him with director Lew Landers, who helped the actor dominate ""The Raven,' making co-star Boris Karloff's turn almost a secondary character. With ""Revenge of Frankenstein,"" director Terrence Fisher's second turn at the helm of a Hammer Films thriller featuring the scalpel-wielding Baron, remains the best of the series, with Peter Cushing at his peak in the starring role. William Castle's ""Mr. Sardonicus"" is one of the better films by the Alfred Hitchcock of low-budget shockers, while skilled character actor Strother Martin ( ""Cool Hand Luke,"" ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"") can't save the turgid yawner, ""The Brotherhood of Satan.""  Given Amazon's low price, however, you really can't lose. Buy it and enjoy.",1517097600,,1347,5.1506849315068495
