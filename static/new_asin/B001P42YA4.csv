3737299,3,B001P42YA4,"""Filth and Wisdom"" is Madonna's 2008 directorial movie debut. Overall the movie was fast-paced and not too interesting because it moved around in many different directions. If you're looking for this film and stumbled upon this page don't worry because there is a US DVD that is out now. You can find it at the Blockbuster Web site. They are the current official/only distributor of the DVD in the US. Although their DVD is a previously viewed copy I don't think anyone would mind as it's available now and less than the DVD on this page. There's also a Canadian DVD and a region 1 DVD from Japan, however these are each more expensive and this site isn't offering either one. (They are selling the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/French-region-2-DVD/dp/B002D2Y9VY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">French region 2 DVD</a>, however that will not play on most US machines.)",1246492800,14,908,5.492857142857143

The movie is about dreams and the difficulties to get them. looking forward to have it on DVD, I saw IT IN NEW YORK. Hope we can see more of her in this genera.

8331952,5,B001P42YA4,"Who can not love a film with Eugene Hutz, (born Yevheniy Aleksandrovich Nikolayev-Simonov in the Ukraine) the super funny actor you may recognize from the film ""Everything Is Illuminated"" or the Gypsy Punk band known as Gogol Bordello. In fact, Hutz made his film debut in the 2005 film Everything Is Illuminated, playing the lead character Alex. In addition to starring in Everything Is Illuminated, Htz wrote and performed (as part of Gogol Bordello) some of the music for the film's soundtrack and his band members had a cameo in the early part of that film. In 2008, this film, Filth and Wisdom, a film that marks Madonnas directorial debut. The movie should probably have a X-Rating for the suggestive sexual themes dealing in sado-masochism, prostitution, drug use, adult nightclubs, etc.. so I don't recommend it as a family film - but if you want to see something entirely different, creative and a story which comes to a nice ending - then you will enjoy this film.

In short, this story revolves around a Ukrainian immigrant (Hutz) who is named A.K. Comically, we see him moonlighting as a cross-dressing dominatrix to make money to finance his rock star dreams. He has two female roommates: Holly (played by Holly Weston), a ballet dancer who works as a stripper and pole-dancer at a local club and Juliette (Vicky McClure), a pill popping pharmacy assistant who dreams of going to Africa to help starving children and whose boss is infatuated with her and fantasizes about her regularly.

A.K. is a character with a very straight-forward philosophical attitude towards life and it played perfectly by Eugene. An interesting tidbit about this film is that Madonna allowed (and encouraged) additional dialogue written by Htz himself to be included in the film. It's no secret - Madonna is (and always has been) a Hutz fan, supporter and admirer. Who wouldn't be - he's awesome and this film shows another side of him.",1426550400,,1927,4.9079754601226995
8331953,4,B001P42YA4,"When I heard this was a movie made by Madonna I had my doubts.  I love her music, movies not so much.  This however was a

8331954,1,B001P42YA4,"1. Choose about half a dozen wacky/ cooky characters with no obvious connection with each other.
2. Put them in about a dozen predictable situations.
3. Add a pop video and a few of your own songs.
4. Don't allow any comedy.

Put in the blender and mix until gooey or slimey.

Half-bake for about an hour and twenty minutes.

Feed the resultant tasteless pap to an insomniac. Guaranteed sleep within a fraction of that time.",1325635200,4,424,4.552631578947368
8331955,5,B001P42YA4,"Madonna has ALWAYS and will always try in some way to send us a message.
If we want to look in the mirror.. thats a different story.
If we want to stop going all out hollywood for heros we want to identify with.. well...
Or maybe we can put our ego aside and watch someone elses point of view for a moment. Perhaps its not meant to be your entertainment.
Perhaps not everything madonna has done or will do had to do with you and what you want. Sometimes artists take a leap and do what they want to do in order to say something. And maybe that takes courage. Lots of courage.
Maybe just maybe there are only a few left in the entertainment industry that are brave enough to make mistakes and make movies that aren't that great and say YEAH but its out there and it says something and its worth it.",1276560000,,797,4.148387096774194
8331956,1,B001P42YA4,"Madonna fans: Buy This Used And Cheap! (Kind of like the Material Girl herself)
A friend popped it in and I was there anyway so we watched this horror show. A couple of funny lines doth not a classic make. How does one who cannot act her way out of a paper bag decide she can direct? Not much of a plot, one of those pictures that is supposed to have some deep message, but just left us dry at the end. In ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" she just played herself, so it was a pretty good movie. But as time goes by, her movies get worse and worse. Considering ""Swept Away,"" THAT is no easy achievement.
For hardcore slobbering fans only. The curious or non-Madonna nuts can stay far away.",1268784000,,683,4.2615384615384615
8331957,2,B001P42YA4,"I was looking forward to this film, if for no other reason than to see what kind of job Madonna did on her directorial debut. What a jumbled mess. At least she still has her music career. I did laugh out loud at a few jokes, and thought Vicky McClure was adorable. However, Eugene Hutz' accent was so thick in places that I had trouble understanding anything he said. As seems typical these days, it seems the film was trying to be more artsy than it actually is - or deserves to be.",1256774400,2,483,4.204301075268817

I think Madonna at the helm of this project instilled that hesitation in me. I found the acting good, and the story intriguing. Three roommates are trying to find their niche in society like we all are. What will they do to find what they are looking for? Most anything, and the audience follows along on their journey.",1254096000,9,706,6.0
