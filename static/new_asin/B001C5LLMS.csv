3506323,4,B001C5LLMS,"If you like your women fair skinned & dark headed, then this is the movie for you.  This is also the movie for you if you like your women without tattoes and without pierceings.  The story starts out with a man, who has a gambleing problem, selling his wife to some hoodlums to pay off his debit.  He continues to rack-up debit.  Since he has nothing left to wager, he offeres to allow the hoodlums to cut off his penus if he looses again.  He looses again, as the hoodlums start to cut of his penus, he manages to esacpe (penus intact).  As he is looking for a place to hide, he notices a groups of eunichs(all the eunichs in this movie are played by beautifull Asiam women) walking by, one of them breaks off from the group to urinate under a tree, at that point he knocks the eunich out and assumes her identity.  Now that I covered how the movie starts, I want to dicuss what I did and didn't about this movie.

What I really liked about this movie was all of the Asian women, all of who are fair sknned, dark-headed and do not have any piereceings or tatoes.  The sex, and there is plent of it, is a mixture of women willingly having sex and women being forced against their will.  There is also several lesbien scenes, one of which has a lactateing breast spraying milk into another girls mouth and all over her face.  There is also a torture scene where two girls are on a teter-totter where every time the teter-totter goes down one of the girls vagina is exposed to a fire that is burning under the the totter.

There is really only one thing about this movie that I didn't like and that was the continuity of the story.  The beginning of the movie, which I mentioned earlier, is told as if it is an old legend passed down from one genration after another, then out of nowhere, we are in modern day China where the story is being told to a group of eunichs.  The movie then continues on with more sex and torture, but then it resets back to the story group, and the chief protaganist believe she is in a dream, and can ""do things differnt this time"".  The movie has this ""reset"" at least 3 different times.  At one point the protaginist switches bodies with another character.  Since this movie is subitiitled, it make it very difficult to keep up with what is going on.

This disc has several extras, including 2 features that show the indivdual actresses playing with themselves.",1221350400,78,2390,4.344594594594595
3506324,2,B001C5LLMS,"This is a rather boring movie; basic plot, rather ugly actresses, and poor acting. The dresses and the decor is nice, but the rest is nothing excitable at all. Soft-porn at its worst. The DVD quality is quite good, but no extras, and sub-titles are not very accurate.",1275696000,,267,4.583333333333333
3506325,4,B001C5LLMS,"Jimmy, a business-like young man, enters a room where a man, the accountant for a shadowy drug lord, is shackled. Over the next week, Jimmy systematically tortures the accountant, demanding information about missing funds. The accountant denies any knowledge. In flashbacks to six months before, we see Jimmy's joining a group of the drug lord's enforcers, surviving brutal hazing, getting his first assignment, and keeping his cool. We also learn that Jimmy has another identity, friends in high places, and a girlfriend unhappy about both his work and his changing personality. Good casting, good acting, intriguing characters, very good pacing all make this an entertaining movie to watch. Although the twists and turns keep things interesting, the major direction becomes increasingly predictable and unfortunately increasingly implausible. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie.",1268265600,,880,5.62406015037594
3506326,5,B001C5LLMS,This is a GREAT edge of your seat movie with a wicked curve ball. Keep your eye on the movie you need to watch EVERY minute to keep from getting lost as the plot line movies FAST. This movie had me guessing all the way to the end and I picked the WRONG man!! Good Luck when you watch like I said it is a good movie!!!,1266796800,2,317,3.746268656716418

Makes you ask though the question, why did they spend the money to make it?  Maybe they thought it would sell with the front of the box Picture.

3506329,2,B001C5LLMS,"look there are some deeply gross scenes for horror fans, but the sex scenes are forgettable and the story is good enough for some interest, and the goddess does get tortured badly, but not enough erotica for my taste",1256774400,19,216,4.564102564102564

3506331,1,B001C5LLMS,"I liked the movie but the ending really really ruined it. It was like they discovered there wasn't much movie budget left and they needed to quickly wrap things up and close the story:

********** Major Ending Spoiler **********

- Kevin convinces his FBI colleagues to start a rescue operation

- Ziggy has FBI inside information and knows there is a rescue operation coming

- Archie Green, the person Kevin is torturing is killed off and his body is dumped in a bag under the torture room

- Ziggy takes plastic surgery to take Archie's place at the FBI rescue operation

- Ziggy let his three henchmen get killed by the FBI, somehow this fits in master plan

- Ziggy can somehow predict the future and knows in this FBI operation he isn't going to get hurt first by Kevin before he gets rescued

- Ziggy can also predict Kevin's dad takes them three to another place where he can steal a gun from Kevin

- Ziggy then like all criminal masterminds do explains how he had this planned for years, even watched Kevin grow up

- Ziggy wants to shoot Kevin in front of his dad's eyes, just to get back at Kevin's dad for killing his daughter

- Kevin's dad jumps in front of the bullet that was meant for Kevin

- Ziggy then tells Kevin how the are alike and how Kevin should join his evil empire

- Ziggy can predict and plan all these things but somehow he can't predict that he can't convince Kevin and that Kevin will want to kill him

The writers knew this was a ridiculous ending and try to save it by a mysterious ending: Kevin walks out of the FBI office and gets a phone call ""I've got a letter from Ziggy, i'm supposed to answer to you, am I speaking to the right person?""

The ending is so ridiculous that it really ruined what could have been a very good movie.

Here a some major flaws:

- Ziggy is (almost) a billionaire: 25 years ago he already had lots of shops, restaurants, etc... all started with his drug money. If you can run a criminal drugs empire for 25 years you'll make tens of millions every year and you have hundreds of henchmen doing your dirty stuff like assassinations, drive by shootings, kidnappings, etc... Ziggy is so careful in the entire movie, has all these goons to protect him and then takes the risk of showing himself. What the hell is Ziggy doing?

- Ziggy knows everything about Kevin and his dad, with all those millions he could just hire armies of goons to kill them both

- Ziggy knew from the start Kevin was FBI, after the coffee shop in the beginning of the movie he could already have killed Kevin, chopped him in pieces and sent him in parts to his father. That would hurt his father more than to shoot Kevin in front of his father.

- Ziggy has plastic surgery to make himself look and talk like a black man? No offense to black people but do you really think a white drug empire kingpin worth a few hundreds millions dollars doing this?

- Shouldn't Ziggy just enjoy the good upper class life in his big villa with his beautiful wive, mistresses and children and have this tiny ant Kevin and his dad crushed by his goons?

- Why waste your valuable time with such a ridiculous plan to destroy your enemy?

I could go on for hours about all the flaws in the ending, but this should be enough explanation.

Good movie, worthless ending.",1245196800,2,3288,4.352459016393443
3506332,5,B001C5LLMS,"I watched this movie with no expectations, mainly because I had never heard about it. However, as soon as the movie starts, it gets very intriguing. The movie is not hard to watch because it is boring, but because of some torture methods that appear to hurt very much. The movie does jump around between time periods a bit, but they piece the movie together very well if you pay attention. The ending is built up very well and I enjoyed the twist. I would highly reccomend watching or buying this.",1230076800,4,497,4.472527472527473
3506333,3,B001C5LLMS,"This title had received no advertising and very little coverage in the ordering publications so I carried few since the cast seemed solid. I was pleasantly surprised.

Cole Hauser leads the film as our undercover FBI agent infiltrating one of the oldest and largest crime syndicates still in operation. James Cromwell plays the FBI Director/dad of our main character, and Lawrence Fishburne plays the tortured victim/hostage of the bad guys. Emmanuelle Chriqui, Robert LaSardo and Jon Cryer round out a recognizable supporting cast who all perform with adequate prose for their shorter roles. The story follows the agent as he has to torture this prisoner to gain the trust of the syndicate. The film leap frogs between time periods of the agent's mission, with graphic depictions of disgusting torture in between.

This movie earns the R rating many times over for violence, and the inevitable B movie feel filters through once in awhile. But Cole (who I liked in Dirty) carries the film nicely as Fishburne and Cromwell play their usual characters from many other films without a problem. I swear LaSardo gets 20 more tattoos between each film - cannot see his skin anymore, good art though. Customers keep asking for a good thriller with any surprising twists (instead of predictable and dumb), and I think this title can keep the masses happy this week.",1221523200,9,1357,5.0

8286114,3,B001C5LLMS,"This movie is a parody of crime thrillers; laden with the cliches of the genre; its title is what the viewer has received as a result of watching it. I give it a moderate star rating because some of the parody seems intentional and funny. For example, when the drug shipment is discovered to be multiple coffins, each inhabited by a dead gangster whose intestines have to be cut out to discover the heroine or cocaine, whatever. The actor who plays the unsuccessful brother in Two-and-a-half men is beside Cole Hauser as he does the cutting and his horrified take is hilarious.",1404691200,,577,4.666666666666667

8286116,3,B001C5LLMS,"Deep undercover in a brutal criminal organization, FBI agent Kevin Cole must use extreme methods to prove himself. Ordered by the mysterious crime boss, Ziggy, to track down stolen millions, Cole has to torture the mob's accountant. But as he starts turning the screws, the mind games begin. Now who's controlling who? Enter the ruthless world of organized crime, where you're only as good as your last lie.

This movie is not bad, but not that good either. It's got a pretty thin story. The main focus on the film, other than brutal torture, is the fragile mental state of the FBI agent who is supposed to be protecting the innocent rather than torturing them. It's a sado masachistic film and it does leave an impression, not a very good one though. The only redeeming thing in this film is the twist at the end. It's not a movie that is worth owning, but I think it may be worth seeing once. That's a toss up though. You're not really missing anything here.",1354406400,,960,4.5491329479768785
