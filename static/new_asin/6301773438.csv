7814920,1,6301773438,what a suck ass movie. and I don't why this flick is on blu ray. what a piece of crap. don't waste your money on the blu ray. the 3-D scenes are short and far in-between. and 3-d scenes SUCK!,1455840000,,191,3.8
7814921,4,6301773438,"Okay, 3-D has come a long way since this movie was made, but this still provides a fun evening with the kids.  And don't feel bad if you start nodding off 'cause the narrator will wake you up when he shouts, ""Put the mask on now! Put the mask on now!""  The story is a bit goofy, but it's nice and creepy when you get to the 3-D scenes.  Viewers who enjoy films such as ""Carnival of Souls"" and ""The Killer Shrews"" are sure to enjoy this rose of the gutter. :)",1276992000,,458,3.9565217391304346

7814923,5,6301773438,"I saw this movie as a child at the theatre.  I was scared ****less!!  Now, having children and grandchildren of my own,  I enjoy watching those things that impressed me so much as a child.  Now that there is EBAY and VCR's, I bought a copy of The Mask.  It even had a pair of 3-D glasses inside.  I like to watch this show when I'm home alone.",1098921600,2,343,3.9705882352941178
7814924,3,6301773438,"This is definitely one of those movies that you have to see only when you're in the right mood for it. Otherwise, the low budget, bad acting, and Elvira lead-in will set you up for a ""it's so bad it's good""  experience, which would be a pity.
This one is out there - a milestone in  the history of the ""psychotronic"" film. The mundane plot is  offset by the most bizarre ""dream"" sequences I know of (with the  possible exception of ""The Electronic Monster"", but let that go  for now....) They were directed by Slavko Vorkapich, a well-known montage  artist whose elaborate work was featured in many films of the 30's and  40's. These sequences are initiated by our stupifyingly dull protagonist  donning an ancient Incan? Aztec? Mayan? ceremonial mask (with the voiceover  ""Put the mask on NOW! supposedly cuing the audience to put on their 3D  glasses with all the subtlety of a large mallet). There's no point in  trying to describe what happens - they are almost plotless, and feature  violent death, astonishingly weird sets (some are reminiscent of Cocteau's  1946 ""Beauty and the Beast"", although far more sinister; others  are more Lovecraftian, as if Cthulhu was in the wings....) and IF you are  in the right frame of mind, they ARE effective DESPITE the obvious low  budget. (I can only imagine what a true-to-form remake could accomplish  with a decent budget.)
So - I'd give the dream sequences 4.5 stars, the  rest of the movie 1.5, and Elvira, well.... ;-)",915753600,,1470,4.743083003952569
