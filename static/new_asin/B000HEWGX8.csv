8139388,5,B000HEWGX8,"Lynley is back at his family's estate when a neighbor is murdered.  Lynley's time at Oxford figures in the plot, as does the actor's (Nathaniel Parker's) ability to ride and handle horses (many depictions of people on horseback make it clear the actor has never done it before and is terrified).  Perhaps not the strongest plot in the series, but great entertainment nonetheless.",1291248000,,379,5.0
8139389,4,B000HEWGX8,"I have been an Elizabeth George fan for years.  I'm always happy to learn she has released a new book.  Although the Inspector Lynley series is merely based on some of the characters she has created, they still seem like old friends to me.  I do miss the envolvement of the St. James element in the films, but fully ejoyed this DVD.",1243382400,,332,4.32258064516129
8139390,4,B000HEWGX8,"Inspector Lyndley mysteries can be counted upon to include a juicy death and a nice trail of clues.  This mystery, the first after a rather dramatic ending to the third series, rather complicates more than it needs to in order to mystify the viewer, and it clears up none of the ambiguities remaining from series three.

On the whole, a disappointment.  Such things happen as a series draws to a close.",1158451200,,402,4.633802816901408
