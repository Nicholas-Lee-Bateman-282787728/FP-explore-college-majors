4007516,1,B002WNUVMU,It wasn't the complete show. Ive seen the entire one before and this copy I had purchased was a edited shorter version of it I wish I could return it honestly and receive the real one,1325376000,3,183,4.111111111111111
4007517,1,B002WNUVMU,i bought this dvd as well and it does suck!! they cut out soooo much!! It was a waste of money!! So disapointing since I love this novela!! Wonder if you can return it??,1295481600,,169,4.0
4007518,1,B002WNUVMU,"I was so happy they put this novela on dvd . But to my disappointment they cut way to much out and it hardly even showed the main characters .They cut out lots of good parts like when julieta has an eating disorder , when el terco dies from a drug overdose and how Jackie's dad dies at the end......also it only showed (Kuno Becker) Ruben like 3 times it didn't even introduce him he just kinda showed up in a scene. I was so sad cuz he was my favorite, And they practically cut him out :/
Don't waist your money.",1274313600,13,513,4.03921568627451
4007519,1,B002WNUVMU,"I received this DVD yesterday and made sure to reserve all day today to watch as much as I could. I should have really listened more to the 2 previous reviews. THEY CUT OUT WAAAY TOO MUCH! You don't even know whats going on with a lot of the story lines because it skips. And forget about the main characters such as Jaqueline, Julieta, Lucia, and Emilia...the whole DVD centers all the attention to the love story of Fernanda and Jose Luis. I couldn't believe how much they left those two characters in but cut out a lot of key parts for the other main characters. Forget about seeing Eduardo Verastigue (Manuel) he barely even comes out. It is sooo hard to follow the novela because it jumps from one scene to another and nothing makes sense anymore. Do not purchase this DVD..dont make the same mistake as I did..its not worth the money!",1272412800,27,840,4.461038961038961
4007520,1,B002WNUVMU,"They really did a disservice to the show.  I mean, it was a silly show, but fun.  My husband got it for my birthday and wanted to watch it on DVD with me because he knew I liked it so much.  He doesn't speak Spanish, however, so we were totally disappointed when we found that there were no English subtitles.  Even Spanish subtitles would have helped, since he can read Spanish pretty well.

Furthermore, they cut out WAY too much.  The story is difficult to follow with so little development.  Total disappointment.",1269475200,10,517,4.554347826086956
4007521,1,B002WNUVMU,"Bad news.. it said, there is english subtitles.. not true.. there is no english subtitles when I received the dvd.. so I am about to send it back and get the refund back.. I hate when it comes to wrong information and waste of time..",1266883200,5,233,4.2
4007545,1,B002WNUVMU,I watched this as a teenager. I couldn't find it at stores or at the library. So i decided to buy it. It didn't have the good parts I remember. It was a good show because because it showed us the results of drug use. This doesnt show those parts! Waist of my money.,1433548800,,265,3.925925925925926

4007548,1,B002WNUVMU,I watched this show as a kid and loved it so when I found it on DVD I was excited but it's not even worth the time. They cut out key elements to the entire show. It jumps around so you don't get what's going on (if you've never watched it). So disappointing. No stars deserved on this one,1421971200,,288,3.8983050847457625

8383287,2,B002WNUVMU,I'm so upset!!!!!! I should have known it would've been bad considering it wasn't expensive. So many scenes are cut off. Probably like the best scenes. I don't recommend. I wish I could return.,1465516800,,193,4.705882352941177
