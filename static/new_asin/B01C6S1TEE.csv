7672711,5,B01C6S1TEE,"Great show! The chemistry with the cast is magic. With all the violent TV today, this is such a welcome change.",1462320000,3,111,4.333333333333333
7672712,5,B01C6S1TEE,"Brilliant writing, outstanding acting, all around a very funny show. These four ladies know how to entertain! And the guest stars never disappoint. They all seem to have such a good time together and the fun is contagious. Valerie Bertinelli is still as cute as can be. Jane leeves has the most awesome legs. Betty White is as funny as ever. Wendie Malick plays vain soap star Victoria Chase. Together they are Hot in Cleveland",1461888000,2,427,4.706666666666667
7672713,1,B01C6S1TEE,"i hate to say this because I loooooove all the actors.  but I think it was horrible.  its like the characters they were suppose to play,  were not clear enough to the actors to know how to play them.  Their was just no clear interesting character. it seemed chaotic.  just my 2 cents.",1461801600,,284,4.283018867924528
7672714,1,B01C6S1TEE,"I'm torn because this show is a 5. All around. :) Highly recommend watching.

The packaging is TERRIBLE. Okay, I can live with that, but as mentioned in other reviews, there were certain discs that skipped on first watch, or just stopped. -_- But not till you get to about Season 3, so you can't really return it unopened.",1525737600,3,322,4.4576271186440675
7672715,5,B01C6S1TEE,"Great show, my wife wanted this.",1521676800,,32,4.5

7672718,5,B01C6S1TEE,"Finally getting to see the whole series - being from Cleveland makes this all the more fun.  One issue though - did anyone else have an issue with the Episode ""What Now, Love"" in Season 4?  It gets halfway into the episode then the disc locks up.  I tried it in another player in my house, and it did the same thing.  I'd hate to return the whole set for one disc - and the disc itself isn't scratched.  Just wondering if it's a glitch in the coding on that particular disc.  So far, I've watched Seasons 1 through 3 without any issues.",1520380800,,536,4.155339805825243
7672719,4,B01C6S1TEE,"I bought this set because I loved the show.  My only complaint is that a show that was shot in hi-def should be available on Blu-ray.  Nonetheless, the picture quality is good but not great.",1520294400,,190,4.4
7672720,5,B01C6S1TEE,This series is so good and I did not even know it was on TV. I love it and everyone in it,1520294400,,89,3.090909090909091

7672722,5,B01C6S1TEE,so funny,1519862400,,8,3.5
7672723,5,B01C6S1TEE,"The concept was gold from the start: take three legendary actors at the top of their craft, Valerie Bertinelli, Jane Leeves, Wendi Mallick, and put them on a stage with a great script and theres lightning in a bottle. Then ask legendary Betty White to do the pilot, knowing that working like this with these people would draw her to a series commitment, and regardless of where its set theres magic. TV Land attempted a number of original programming (The Exes was very good) but Hot In Cleveland had the magic to run six seasons.

If theres a veteran sitcome actor out there who didn't guest or play a long arc here I cant think of who. Wayne Knight, Jon Lovitz, Dave Foley, Maggie Wheeler, Susan Lucci, Georgia Engle, Valerie Harper, Cloris Leachman, Mary Tyler Moore, Tim Daly, Chevy Chase, Don Rickles, Carl Reiner, Buck Henry, Carol Burnet- gasp- as I said, its easier to list who wasn't on.

The writing is clever and fun and though the premise is EXACTLY that of The Golden Girls (three middle aged women sharing house with an old, wise and irritable woman) it manages not to duplicate any of the Susan Harris show.

There are two brilliantly done Live episodes that far out-wit Will & Grace ace and easily equal The Honeymooners, and the tongue in cheek, relax and laugh charmis refreshing.

Go on. Trust me. Its a blast.",1519776000,,1329,4.61864406779661
7672724,3,B01C6S1TEE,"The series is, of course, brilliant my rating is not a reflection of the show. The packaging is less than spectacular. The discs come stacked in a plastic holder that are bound together by more plastic which is separated from the interior of the case making it easy for the discs to fall out. However for the price and the sheer amount of content you get it is easy to accept the quality price over the poor quality packaging. The discs themselves are just those of the previous season releases with the same bonus features. You really can't beat the price! I'm very glad to have the series on DVD, I just wish the studios would provide better packaging!",1519257600,3,654,4.504201680672269

7672727,1,B01C6S1TEE,A very tasteless and vulgar show especially Betty White.  An octogenarian making smutty comments was a complete turn-off especially for an actress of her caliber.  Every time it came on TV switched the channel,1511913600,,209,5.117647058823529
7672728,5,B01C6S1TEE,"I love Hot in Cleveland.  The 4 women are veteran comedy actresses at the top of their game.  The writing is witty, the delivery the best, and the guest stars are a walk down memory lane.  I'm delighted with my purchase.",1511740800,,220,4.317073170731708
7672729,5,B01C6S1TEE,Love this show! Had all episodes recorded on DVR but lost them when changing carriers. Now I get to enjoy them commercial free without forwarding - yeah! I'm not totally through all the discs but have not experienced any issues as others have reported.,1509321600,,252,4.75
7672730,5,B01C6S1TEE,Great show,1509235200,,10,4.5
7672731,5,B01C6S1TEE,"This is one of the funniest shows I have ever watched. Only a couple TV shows have ever made me laugh out loud and every episode of this does that for me. The ""birthdate"" episodes are the best!! This show reminds me of a mix of Sex and the City & Golden Girls. I hated to see it end.",1509148800,,283,3.8135593220338984
7672732,1,B01C6S1TEE,The last disc had glue deposits on the disc so episodes were unwatchable,1507939200,,72,4.615384615384615

7672737,5,B01C6S1TEE,"Laugh til I cry at this funny, funny show...the cast is amazing, each actress is perfect for her character.

7672742,4,B01C6S1TEE,"What a fun series!  I never saw this on TV, and bought it sight unseen as something I thought my wife would like.  I was right....it's great!  Super stars, how do you get better than Betty White!?!  And the guest starts are fantastic.  A little (maybe more than a little) dirty, but it's hard to find something I could watch next to my daughter anymore.  Thanks, we're enjoying the series,  Dave (in Colorado)",1500508800,,409,4.52054794520548

7672745,5,B01C6S1TEE,Love this series. I'm enjoying watching them without the nasty commercials. Have to been through the whole set yet but so far they've all played well.,1500163200,,150,4.8076923076923075

7672749,4,B01C6S1TEE,Loved the show so bought the item. The only thing I felt was my set was used.  The dvds were. It in order in package and the package I ordered had individual sleeves this one came with all discs in one container.  But I enjoyed it and it was a good price.,1498089600,,255,3.8846153846153846

7672753,5,B01C6S1TEE,Waited to buy the complete series. This show kept getting better and better each year. A strong female ensemble. Betty White is still spot on with her comic timing. Recommend to anyone who wants to laugh a lot.,1495324800,2,210,4.552631578947368

7672756,5,B01C6S1TEE,Great.,1493942400,,6,6.0
7672757,3,B01C6S1TEE,"Great Writing, Great Acting, But Very Shallow Characters.  While the stories are often quite clever, the underlying theme of almost every episode is ""I WANT A MAN!!!!"" All 4 characters seem totally obsessed with finding a man in almost every episode. I am no prude, but this obsession tends to make the characters seem very shallow to me.  Is THIS feminism's finest hour? Women who can't get through a single episode without sleeping with someone? If their man hunger is so extreme, why don't they just hang a red light on the porch and become Cleveland's high class hookers?

Maybe this is a show for women, so as a man I tend to just not get it.  Don't women have more going on in their lives than just a never ending  hunt for the perfect man? Is this really all women have attained in the 21st century?

I just think it is sort of a 1 trick pony show.",1492646400,,855,4.345911949685535

7672759,3,B01C6S1TEE,"Funny, sassy gals, ala ""The Golden Girls"" --- updated.  I did not watch the TV programs, so enjoyed binge-watching without commercials.  Episodes included many ""old"" TV guest star personalities seldom seen any more, plus some young ones whose names were familiar to me, but not their faces.  (I'm not a big TV watcher.)  In short, lots of fun -- and I will watch it again every year or two.",1490832000,,390,4.608695652173913

P.S. The show is great; but, the packaging very poor. For this kind of money you couldn't put each disk in its' own sleave?",1490486400,4,381,4.478260869565218

7672764,5,B01C6S1TEE,I actually had never watched this show before when it was on TV because I'm not a big fan of Betty White.  After watching a few episodes I was hooked because It is hysterical and she is so funny with her snippy comments.  I also got to see a lot of well-known actors/actresses guest starring in this show that I haven't seen in a long time.  This is definitely a must have.  It's too bad it went off the air.,1488326400,3,408,4.0625
7672765,5,B01C6S1TEE,Great show. Can't go wrong here this set includes all of the seasons.,1487980800,,69,4.384615384615385

7672767,5,B01C6S1TEE,"As a Clevelander, I loved Hot in Cleveland but the show was terrific not just because it was about my hometown.  It really is all about the chemistry of the four lovely ladies who star in the show.  It is a fantastic show about friendship and adding new friends.  The laughs keep coming and the delivery is by fantastic performers who have honed their crafts.  If you enjoyed The Golden Girls, you will like Hot in Cleveland not just because the fantastic Betty White is on the both shows.  This specific set is not the most well made.  It is essentially clear plastic holders and the cover but the dvds themselves play great and it was a great price to be able to get the entire series.",1486252800,3,687,4.3700787401574805

7672780,5,B01C6S1TEE,"Picture quality is really pretty decent for DVD and it's a funny show, I find myself laughing constantly at its one-liner humor.  Great cast.  Beware the case insides have doors which hold the CDs and mine came broken up from shipping and one disc was floating loose and got scratched up.  So check it when you get it.  It's the cheap plastic they use nowadays this is common when buying these sets I'm finding.  So I didn't even call in over a few unhinged broken door pages, at least they're not thrown in paper sleeves in a stack.  It's a nice case otherwise.  I found this at a great price on amazon and snapped it up, really good deal for all seasons in one nice case.  Can't go wrong with this is you enjoy the show you will love this and if you've never seen the show youtube it and check out some clips and then buy this, tons of hours of fun at a good price and the nice thing is the whole family can watch this show.

8752381,5,B01C6S1TEE,"I .haven't watched all episodes of the series yet, but so far the DVDs are performing well, providing funny lines and short extra features on the last disc of each season-at least the first two seasons. The discs are hard to remove from the case, though, and are arranged so that one disc lies under the previous one making access even more difficult. The plastic case does at least provide extra protection from falls, etc",1534204800,,423,4.653333333333333

All three of the stars - Valerie Bertinelli, Janes Leeves, Wendie Malick - were at their peak. Add Betty White's one liners and you have an instant classic. Another thing I loved about this show was how much it respected and brought on so many of the famous comedians from yesterday - Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler Moore, Valerie Harper, Cloris Leachman, Don Rickles, Bob Newhart, Carl Reiner, etc. and many more.",1533513600,,522,4.505263157894737
