8507997,5,B00713NC0Y,Another great product from Lin & Larry Pardey. I think I have every book and DVD the Pardey's have ever produced. We met them in person back over 10 years ago. We have followed their advice and they have never steered us wrong.. Another Great Job...,1370217600,,249,4.434782608695652
8507998,3,B00713NC0Y,"Been a fan for many years, from the first book they published thru the vhs years and now this. They are a little older and more seasoned but more or less its the same info. To their credit, reading or watching their previous work has stood the test of time.
But for me, I've been there done that, Enjoyable, like seeing a long lost friend.",1365120000,2,339,4.230769230769231
8507999,5,B00713NC0Y,"This is a fun DVD to watch and it really feels like you are spending some time with Lin and Larry talking about how to keep the cost of cruising under control.  They have a lot of useful ideas that you can incorporate into your own cruising - the costs can be prohibitive now which is why the information in here is so helpful and presented in such a nice manner.
The DVD is well put together incorporating some fun video from previous cruises - it is certainly one that will be useful as a reference and as another reviewer said it is 'Not Preachy'.
Without doubt this is their best DVD so far, especially the atmosphere that they create.  Look forward to a future DVD with them sitting back and talking about some of their great experiences!",1342828800,,743,4.3768115942028984
8508000,5,B00713NC0Y,I thought this program was the closest you can get to spending an evening with Lin and Larry. It's presented in a highly organized way but interspersed with humor and cruising video that is obviously shot in lots of different countries. It definitely lays out the ways to enjoy cruising without blowing your budget. Not preachy at all. The extras are lots of fun too.,1340755200,2,367,4.661538461538462
