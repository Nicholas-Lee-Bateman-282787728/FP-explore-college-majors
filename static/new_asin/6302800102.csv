7832273,5,6302800102,"This is undoubtedly the best set of all-around fitness videos of all time. Pollan-Austen Studios in New York taught me how to get fit and stay fit. I'd not part with my own set of these for any money! DO WISH THERE WAS A DVD FORMAT! If I didn't have a VHS, I'd buy one just to use these.

I'd buy ANY WORKOUT this great team of women produced. Safe, healthy, and geared to everyone from beginner to advanced - you can use EVERY video in this set, and just set your own rate. The women (Caren, Lori and Dana) that teach this method KNEW how to give you the ultimate workout without knocking yourself out. I finish each of these sessions with a feeling of renewal and ability to face the day. The meditative cooldown is not boringly lengthy, rather, it is a chance to stretch, and breathe. LOVE THIS, and WISH this Studio was still open!",1307318400,,835,4.284810126582278
7832274,5,6302800102,"I've had this VHS tape for years (probably since the mid-1990s) and wish it were available on DVD.  I still use it and am happy to say it has helped me maintain my fitness level at age 56.  The aerobics section is one of the best I have even seen.  These young ladies don't scream or yell at you like football coaches. The overall effect is a low keyed, solid, sustained workout.",1219881600,,379,4.236111111111111
