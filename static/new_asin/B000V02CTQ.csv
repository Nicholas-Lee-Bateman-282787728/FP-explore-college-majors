2928073,5,B000V02CTQ,"This is a classic match in which Arthur Ashe made one of the most amazing stategic decisions I have ever seen. He completely adapted his power game to thwart Connors. It is also a perfect example of what a poor attitude & behaviour can do for a world-class player like Connors. Watch this DVD if only to see how not to conduct yourself during a match. Ashe was a consumate professional, although certainly not as he himself admitted a great talent, but his intelligence clearly won the day and the match.",1206921600,7,504,4.549450549450549
8215995,5,B000V02CTQ,"This is a great tennis classic. To watch  Arthur Ashe remain relaxed, remain focused and exploit Jimmy Connors weakness (short ball to his forehand) was extremely enjoyable. What was most impressive was the strategy and the refinments to that strategy to win. If you are a tennis fan or not this is must see.",1506643200,,308,4.703703703703703

Even so, this is an excellent addition to our DVD collection.  What happened to all the notorious John MacEnroe/Jimmy Connor matches?  I hope they show up on DVD in classic form...",1367798400,2,314,4.571428571428571
8215999,4,B000V02CTQ,"Though the photography on the cover is in black and white the video is in color.  It's wimbledon so the announcers are a bit subdued on account of being English,  not like the color commentary of recent personalities like Johnny Mac or Brad Gilbert.  It was cool to see tennis in the 70's and Connors wielding his t2000.  This match will always be held up as a highest example of tactical tennis and has the good drama of the wiley veteran vs the brash young man.  Also, a nice contrast of styles of serve and volley vs baseline.",1367280000,,529,4.357142857142857
8216000,5,B000V02CTQ,"I was born in 1965 and I remember didsliking Jimmy Connors because my father did. It wasn't his tennis, it was his boorish behavior. So, when I heard on the news that Ashe beat him (it wasn't shown live in the States) I was happy. Upsets make great theater so I always wanted to see this match and was surprised by the superb picture. I wish that the broadcast utilized replay more and the announcers were a little less understated. But otherwise a must have.",1344729600,,459,4.411764705882353
8216001,4,B000V02CTQ,"This is one of the greatest vintage Wimbledon matches on DVD; it features ""the terminator"" Jimmy C. vs. ""the professor"" Ashe, who outsmarted Connors and won a memoriable '75 final. Recommended to tennis-fans!!",1290038400,2,209,5.363636363636363
8216002,5,B000V02CTQ,"Although I've been playing tennis consistently since I was a kid the mid '70s, this was the first time I've ever seen Arthur Ashe play a full match. What a treat! He was graceful and smooth, and he had a MONSTER serve that he could move all over the box. I've read about this match many times, and I've always wanted to see it--especially since I've never liked Jimmy Connors and I enjoy watching him lose.

It's true. Ashe did chop Connors up. From everything I've read, Ashe was known for his power game, and in this match he lobs and slices Connors to pieces. My guess is that Connors wasn't at his best that day, but one gets the impression that Ashe really caught him off guard by mixing up the pace. Connors looked completely befuddled in the first two sets.

As a high school tennis coach, I often show old matches to my players when it rains. For the most part, I try to avoid anything involving wood or metal rackets because, frankly, the matches seem like they're being played in slow motion. Compared to today's punishers like Federer and Nadal or Sharapova or the Williams sisters, bygone champions like Borg and McEnroe or Evert and Navratilova--who thrilled me when I was in high school-- just don't seem to cut it with today's kids.

That said, the 1975 Ashe/Connors final somehow seems more relevant, and I'm looking forward to watching it with my team one of these days. The tennis was very entertaining, and, as much as I hate Connors, I always knew his fundamentals were worth copying. One nice thing about older matches is that players tended to stick with standard strategies--good old ""percentage"" tennis, as we instructors call it--and it's a little easier for young players to discern certain patterns with the older players. Not that today's pros don't rely on strategy, but they can hit the ball so much harder that they do things--like hitting clean winners from behind the baseline--that defy traditional teaching. If you get to the pro level, that stuff is great, but most high school players--and the rest of us, too--would do well to rediscover the basics.  If you watch Ashe and Connors, they played almost every deep ball cross-court and almost every short ball down the line, promptly following it to the net. That's percentage tennis, and you can reach a pretty high level by trying it.

Check out this match. You won't be disappointed (unless, of course, you love Jimmy Connors).",1231372800,3,2415,4.713270142180095
8216003,5,B000V02CTQ,"I was glad to get this DVD, mostly because of Arthur Ashe. This is the first DVD that I know of that shows him in a tennis match. I was amazed to see how fast these guys serve the ball - not for the speed of the ball when served but for how little time they took between each ended point to serve the ball. It's a big contrast to the way the game is played now. There was no reviewing of points played, they just played. Very impressive!",1223510400,2,437,3.9213483146067416
8216004,5,B000V02CTQ,It is hilarious to see connors' outbursts in this.  Ashe completely changed his game to what it took to beat connors.,1214265600,2,117,4.571428571428571
