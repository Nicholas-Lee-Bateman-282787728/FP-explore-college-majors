1194165,5,B000006FNL,"When I was younger, Sam Peckinpah's more violent films were my favorites, now, as I approach the age of the title character, this film is far and away my favorite. Peckinpah came up with a philosophical, almost biblically themed picture here- yet it is also filled with the most laugh-out-loud humor of any of his films. It had to be an accident, it just works too perfectly to have been done on purpose....
This is the story of Cable Hogue, a prospector in the Arizona territory of 1908. He is left to die without water by his two partners. Not only is he left to die- he is laughed at because of his ""yellowness"" at not doing the same to them when given a chance. So Cable tries to walk out of the desert knowing that he has no chance. He talks (he never prays) to the God that he has never had much use for. As a result, he finds water; water where it never was and could never possibly be.
This is the start of Cable's desert kingdom. He builds it out of nothing and out of bluff. He builds it with his own hands, out of what the desert provides. When necessary, he defends it with deadly force. Yet Cable gains respect and friends along the way. Sure, he can be mean and ruthless when he has to be, but to those who prove worthy, he can be a generous and loyal friend. He even wins the love of the most beautiful woman in a land where women are scarce (Stella Stevens- she never looked better than she did in this film.)
Then, at the height of his success, the two former partners that left him to die are delivered into his hands....
I used to wonder at the name ""Cable"", since I had never heard it before. Then I got it, Cable is a combination of Cain and Abel. This is because Cable is a combination of good and bad. On the one hand he is capable of hardness, even to the point of taking a life, but on the other hand he can show justice and mercy in sparing a life. To paraphrase the phoney preacher at the end of the film, Cable wasn't strictly a good man, and he wasn't strictly a bad man, but Lord- he was a MAN!",1053907200,20,2024,4.113636363636363
1194166,5,B000006FNL,"Starring Jason Robards & Stella Stevens and Directed by  Sam Peckinpah,  The Ballad of Cable Hogue is a brilliant little gem of a movie that somehow never made it onto the national radar screen when it was released.  A major departure for Peckinpah, whose forte back then was the ultra violent epic-movies like The Wild Bunch and the highly acclaimed Straw Dogs-The Ballad of Cable Hoague tells the tail of a fellow abandoned for dead out in the western desert who is lucky enough to find the equivalent of an oasis and converts the spot into a way station for the pony express and the stage coach runs of the time.  Wonderfully acted by Robards as Hoague and Stella Stevens as the nearby town's ""working girl"" as his romantic interest, the story is in essence a depiction of western life and the characters of the time.
This was a wonderful vehicle for may well know western character actors of the day: It's full of those sort of actor you recognize in an instant and have no idea what their name is.  The story is sweet and engaging and the movie is totally devoid of the violence and gore that Peckinpah was famous for at the time.
So, if you are the sort of person who wants a movie to actually tell a story, actually present real characters, and warm your heart-this is definitely a choice you should make.  You will not be disappointed.",1014940800,48,1343,4.506172839506172
1194167,5,B000006FNL,"gee what a crappy review by Leonard Maltin. The film is not overlong. And it is a FILM, not a moo-vie, and it deserves to be praised. It is not overlong at all. I guess he's too busy reviewing chop-house wasterns, surely not his favorite genre anyway; he prefers all glitz, big names and no substance. This film is wonderful. All the roles, ALL, are played extremely well, and very believably. It has much to offer.. truly funny moments and situations, a fair amount of suspense and action, and an excellent screenplay. It is more like you are there, watching real people, not Hollywood actors who are thinking about something else when being filmed. The most memorable moments in The Ballad of Cable Hogue are the tender ones between Cable and his ill-found, but adoring younger sweetheart. The music is very special also. I love the song "" Butterfly mornings and Wildflower Afternoons "" I think it deserves 5 stars.",986169600,7,917,4.7375
1194168,5,B000006FNL,"The Ballad of Cable Hogue is one of those films which is a complete story. True to life, tragic, touching, funny and yet at times embarrasing and sentimental, it ends in a melancholic tragedy that leaves the viewer content, but looking ahead toward their own life.
Sam Peckinpah shows his absolute mastery of the directors art in shaping a story into a beautifully shot, superbly acted, charmingly scored but above all sensitively directed cameo of the end of the wild west.
Jason Robards gives an unparalleled performance, a character that is a creation in itself. Stella Stevens, for any and every man who watches this reminds us of the mystery that is a woman.
Robards Cable Hogue is the hard bitten, down at heel rambler who finds his fortune in a near death experience. The delicious Miss Stevens is a saloon gal who is touched by Cable Hogue's simplicity and down to earth appreciation of her. He falls in love with her and the story gets underway.
There are 3 charming and unashamedly sentimental songs arranged by Jerry Goldsmith and performed in a hip country western style by Richard Gillis.
In its own way this film is a small masterpiece, see it and enjoy.",983836800,7,1168,4.730392156862745

1194196,4,B000006FNL,"Please note: This is not for the DVD individually or the 4 film set but for the Blu-ray. Amazon in their infinite wisdom has decided to combine this with other reviews of the film (as they often do-- which is sloppy and typically done by some grunt at Amazon without checking) as they consider ALL product to be the same regardless of format, year or set. Carry on!

Who would have thought that a romantic-comedic would be at the heart a Sam Peckinpah film. Shot directly after the violent ""The Wild Bunch"" followed by ""Straw Dogs"". Peckinpah's Film expertly balances all of those elements of n a western powered by the performances of Jason Robards as the title character and Stella Stevens the object of his affection.

Hogue and his two partners (L.Q. Jones and Strother Martin) leave him stranded in the desert when they discover that the land they were going to use as a watering station between two towns is dry as a bone. After much praying, suffering and starving Hogue discovers  the water hole and it runs just close enough to the trail to make it profitable. Meeting a horny ""preacher"" --from the church of the Wayfaring Strangers-- (the always wonderful David Warner) who suggests the name ""Cable Springs"". As time passes, Hogue hooks up with a hooker with a heart of gold (we'll sort of) he meets named Hildy (Stella Stevens) when filing a claim for his land. Even with modest prosperity Hogue has two things on his mind--Hildy and revenge against his former partners.

Peckinpah's direction of this gentler tale remains as nimble as for his most notable films. Unfortunately, Peckinpah drank uncontrollably, was temperamental for n set and fired 36 crew member without warning. This cause the film to fall behind schedule and go over budget driving a wedge between Warner and Peckinpah removing him for consideration for ""Deliverence"" and ""Jeremiah Johnson"" both of which would have fit his sensibility. This forced Peckinpah to go overseas for his next project "" Straw Dogs"" which probably got its financing because of Star Dustin Hoffman.

Peckinpah's Film and sent flawless but those flaws are very easy to over look given the charm of the film and the gruff performance of Robards and Stevens charming performance as Hildy. The Warner Archive restoration looks extremely good and is true to the typical look of a Technicolor color of the time. I didn't note any specs or noticeable print damage. The mono audio sounds solid but reveals it's limitations particularly during Jerr Goldsmith's fine score. We get subtitles in English only (same with audio).

Unlike someone  Warner Archive releases, this has a nice set of special features that compliment the film and are appropriate to a director of Peckinpah's reputation.

First up we get a very good commentary track by moderated by Nick Redman, Biographers Paul Seymour and documentarian filmmakers Garner Simmons and David Weddle discussing the shooting of the film, the troubles they had, the relationship between cast and director and previous and later films. We also get a nearly 30 minute featurettes on Stella Stevens. We get the original theatrical trailer as the final extra here.

A surprisingly comedic western from bloody Sam, ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" is a gem of a movie with nice performances and special features. Image quality is exceptional with littl to no speckling and no noticeable print damage.

I enjoyed Ride the High Country and The Wild Bunch, but I'm super disappointed I didn't get through this film with Jason Robards.

I guess I'll have to legally pirate this thing someplace, since I own a copy, despite the physical media not actually playing (around chapter 19).

1194207,3,B000006FNL,"After reading some of the other reviews.  It seems like this is a very highly regarded movie.  I would have only been ten years old when it came out.  And didn't see it until it showed up on Cinemax or one of those channels a long time later.  I have never been too much of a fan of Jason Robards.  Although he has been pretty good in some other westerns I have seen like Once Upon A Time In The West and Comes A Horseman.  But I do like Stella Stevens.  Ever since I saw The Poseidon Adventure.  She was close to forty years old when this came out and she sizzles.  It also has David Warner who every time I see him I always think of Strawdogs.  Strother Martin, L.Q Jones and Slim Pickens.
The story is basically Jason Robards discovers a water hole in the middle of the desert and then charges for it.  It is better then it sounds.  I don't think it is as good as a lot of the other reviewers do.  But it's alright.",1476403200,,918,4.033333333333333

I still haven't watched ""Ride the High Country,"" having watched a copy from the library which influenced me to buy this box set.

1194211,4,B000006FNL,"Released in 1970 and directed by Sam Peckinpah, The Ballad of Cable Hogue is a quirky Western drama/comedy/romance starring Jason Robards as a grizzled man left to die in the SW desert, but he miraculously finds a spring and starts a way station servicing stagecoach people and other travelers. He befriends a dubious evangelist (David Warner) and falls in love with a local prostitute (Stella Stevens) while hoping for revenge against the men who double-crossed him (Strother Martin & L.Q. Jones). R.G. Armstrong is on hand as a banker.

If you're looking for a conventional Western akin to Pechinpahs Ride the High Country (1962) or The Wild Bunch (1969), look elsewhere because this is a totally offbeat Western. As noted above, its an eccentric mix of drama, comedy and romance, but such a description doesnt do it justice because its so much more. Despite its amusing elements, its a clever commentary on the human condition: The nature of God and man, spirit and flesh, love and sex, vengeance and forgiveness, religion and libertinism. Legalistic types might find it offensive and anti-God, but nothing could be further from the truth. The LORD is all over this movie, despite the characters overt moral failings or simple ignorance, just as depicted in the bible (the stories of Samson, Rahab and Naomi come to mind). If you can overlook the goofiness, or let it amuse you, this movie is actually profound with riches to mine. My title blurb says it all.

The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada.

The Ballad of Cable Hogue is a bittersweet reminder to seize the brass ring as soon as you can because the merry-go-round of life can and will stop at any time, without notice.

1194290,5,B000006FNL,"THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE is a sweet odd-ball last-of-the-western-days western.  And it is now my second favorite revenge movie.

My favorite revenge movie is THE DUELLISTS.  Strictly, neither THE DUELLISTS nor THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE are typical revenge movies; probably why I love them so much.

Some excellent editing and screenwriting and acting and directing gets the set-up for this movie going during the credits, and (a rarity for me) I don't think I used the fast forward button once.  I did use the rewind button several times to see some scenes over.

Cable is out in the desert, about to kill a gila monster for his supper, when he is ambushed by two tricky bandits who steal his horse, his guns, and most important, his water.  Cable heads off on foot, vowing revenge, in desperate search for distant water, and days later when he is so exhausted he can go no further realizes his worn-out boot is moist.  He finds moist sand; digs down, and finds drinkable water.

Cable discovers that the water he has found is right near a main road about half way between two large towns.

Cable proves up and establishes legal claim to the water, and sets up a water, food, and relief stop for the stages going by on the road between the two towns.  How Cable does this, while finding romance, is the real story, but in the back of his mind is always the hope for revenge, that the terrible two would one day pass through his water station, and he would be able to get even.

Cable gets his revenge, but it's not the revenge anyone could predict.

1194297,5,B000006FNL,"This collection offers a sampling of Sam Peckinpah's films which display his use of the western genre to exhibit a code of behavior he views as endemic to the American spirit. Each of the four movies revolve around the dichotomy between political law and the code of rugged individualism. Jason Robards' portrayal of Cable Hogue and Joel McCrae's wandering ex-lawman both exemplify this code of exceptionalism and self reliance that transcends civil law in the director's scheme of things. The kristofferson and Coburn friendship headed toward death in the Billy the Kid mythos, again illustrates the individual's conflict within the body politic. The Wild Bunch combines the various threads woven throughout the four films into a tapestry seductive in its beautiful violence and disconcerting in its ethical ambiguity. Oh yeah, and then we have the bonus of Bob Dylan's enigmatic role as ""Anonymous"" a kind of deus ex machina of irony riding with the Kid and into the Peckinpah legacy.

1194313,5,B000006FNL,"The musical nature of this movie fixes it in a time of national transition. Sam Peckenpaw may have had a vision of what was happening as the classic America Western was being supplanted by foreign 'Spegetti Westerns' of more violent exploits. In this sense, this little movie says a great deal about the America of the 1970's. It was and is almost phophetic in its' depiction of the death of ideals as new technology advances on a society.

The acting is intentionally bawdy as were the people of the times for which the movie was created. It may leave some feeling a bit unclean. I beleive this fact contributes to the comedy, This movie, as literature, is an indispensible aid to understanding America and the people who inhabit that nation. The stylization is pure Americana of the nostalgic variety that reminds us what the potentials of freedom are. It speaks volumes about issues of concern in our modern society; (privacy, security, personal relationships, social responsibility & technology; to name a few).",1323734400,,1015,4.935672514619883
1194314,5,B000006FNL,"If you view the four movies comprising the Sam Peckinpah's Legendary Westerns Collection and don't agree it is the single best collection of western varieties ever . . . well, just as Angel said to the Bunch--as some didn't share his vision that Mexico was more beautiful than Texas crossing the swollen river into his homeland--""You have no eyes.""
  The Wild Bunch is simply the best real Western ever. Men learn how to be men; how to handle failure with its recognition then laughing the pain away so one can go forward. The idea of loyalty, so missing in modern day bunches, is emphasized here like Pike preaching, ""Once you side with a man, you stay with him; otherwise you're just like some animal."" And so your modern personal business model has changed . . . Medicare doesn't reimburse enough, commissions are squeezed, selling a book doesn't earn what it used to . . . all of those things are not new. A startling hero of the movie, Edwin O'Brien as Freddie Sykes, remembers at the end whatever you like and want and need to do, ""It ain't like it used to be, but it'll do,"" electrically making it okay to go on and enjoy, the heck with everything else. After this movie, worth every penny of the collection, the rest cost nothing but are perfect attendees to the king of westerns, The Wild Bunch.
  Billy Bob Thornton comments in the special features of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, this is his favorite of Peckinpah's Westerns because it is so far out there--way out. The story between the two ""friends,"" James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson, is cut in the Peckinpah way of surprises, twists, and then touching moments interspersed with the harsh realities of the untamed West. You'll never again see anything like this. Leaving the lead character's performances for the moment--Coburn is as menacing a psychopath as Kristofferson's Billy--Richard Jaeckel as Sheriff Kip McKinney ""goes loco"" with his fundamentalist beliefs trying to redeem Billy's soul before the hanging. Peckinpah's slight of hand in his direction allows the viewer to inhabit the moment as a shotgun loaded with 16 dimes does far more than $1.60 worth of killing. The minor character Donnie Fritts brings to life Beaver who is so unintentionally funny as his lines are repeating what was just said, causing even Garrett so laugh behind clinched teeth over a cigar while he contemplates ""tickling (Fritts') private parts"" with a bullet.
  The entrepreneurial Cable Hogue, the best blue-collar frontiersman hero yet, winning the pretty girl, Stella Stevens' Hildy, with his deep pioneering spirit and fumbling ways, tells a life one comes to see as the way Peckinpah may have viewed his own, even down to the funeral. His conversations with the Lord are a reflection of a religion where Holy Ones are friends, and when you need water, and on about the third day going without, you're going to talk to that friend in a pretty harsh, direct way. "". . . Now about sinnin', you just send me a drop or two (of rain), and I won't do it no more... whatever in hell it was that I did.""
  L Q Jones calls Ride the High Country the best Saturday matinee, take your girl friend and eat popcorn Western movie ever. There's a love story here and with feeling the viewer sees it develop in a wonderful way even at a dinner she cooks ""a fine ham hock; eating Chapter one,"" in a reference to the strict Biblical father's quoting scripture to squeeze every drop out of happiness. But the powerful story here is of two men, now out-of-date cowboys, aging, and in doing so, refinding their moral compass and friendship of one another. This yields one of the all-time best lines in any movie, a thought that can guide one's life as a goal, an aspiration higher than any other: ""All I want is to enter my house justified."" View the movie and the special featurette where this notion is discussed . . . you won't be able to forget it.
  The box-set cover reflecting a scene from each of the four films also has a side portrait of Peckinpah himself, looking into a camera as his mind saw and interpreted a unique vision of changes in life and how one is left behind in a different era. It is in many respects like any modern times, yet the parable is set in these frontier times, and harsh times lead to some very difficult outcomes. But along the way, all of these characters lived, really lived, a lesson all of us need to remember as we find ourselves becoming politically-correct stiffs. Watching this collection will enhance your life, broaden your horizons, and deepen appreciation of the twisted but brillant creator, Sam Peckinpah.",1323475200,6,4595,4.689826302729529

Of these films, ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" is less known, having been placed on the backburner by the studio and released with relatively no publicity following the release of ""The Wild Bunch"", despite Cable Hogue being filmed before it. ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" begins much like other Peckinpah films: an older man of the Western frontier, wronged and tossed around by younger gunslingers, only to be left alone and left to die while vowing revenge if he lives. Seemingly, Hogue will veer down the road familiar to Peckinpah, a revenge fantasy in a changing Western frontier, where the old ways are being pushed aside in favor of modernity. Then the film does a 180, turning into a farcical sex romp comedy (brought about by a priest!). A welcome change of pace given Peckinpah's oeuvre. Which isn't to say his other films are devoid of humor; he often injects it among his most violent fare as a mean of lightening the dark mood. But to structure a whole film as a comedy would appear to be beyond Peckinpah's grasp yet it feels remarkably like a Peckinpah film. The final act sees his favorite themes reemerge: revenge and modernity. Where in his other films the main character would get his revenge culminating in a bloody shootout, here Peckinpah turns this expectation on its head, forgiving a man that wronged him and in fact rewarding him after feeling sorry for him. The theme of modernity is also addressed by Peckinpah. Represented by a car, Peckinpah has Hogue face the changing landscape of the West with comical results. ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" is a welcome departure from Peckinpah's moody and sometimes overused violence, a Western comedy that refuses to take itself seriously. Highly recommended",1295827200,10,1934,4.899390243902439

Interesting performance by David Warner as a very carnal preacher.  Robards -- in the space of three years -- appears in three classic westerns: as Doc Holliday in John Sturges' HOUR OF THE GUN, Cheyenne in Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and this one.  Hogue is a character you can like, despite his flaws, and his end, after achieving it all, is touching.

Everything a young auteur needs.  His action films are excellent, like Straw Dogs and, of course, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.  But where he really cut his teeth, and where his true excellence lies, is with the western.

1194338,5,B000006FNL,"Although Cross of Iron is my favourite Peckinpah movie none of these disappoint. From Ride the High Country through to Pat Garrett and Bily the Kid Peckinpah stamps his own distinctive mark on the western genre.

The themes that runs through Ride the High Country are present in The Wild Bunch and for that matter in Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia as well. Take the classic wedding sequence in RTHC. Elsa has runaway to spite her father and commits to marrying Billy Hammond. Hammond it turns out is one five brothers who are borderline nutcases, reminding me vaguely of a 'Hills have Eyes' like group. So a squalid group of brothers whose attitude to women is, well, backward. Elsa is torn between backing out of the wedding, because she realises the nature of the men, but she is either too scared or still wants to spite her father. This theme of squalidness is ever an present theme in Peckinpahs movies. Fortunately for Elsa there is another way out.

The Wild Bunch takes another theme used in RTHK; that of aging cowboys who want to make one last stand for what they believe to be right in the dying west. There are some marvellous set pieces in this film, noteably two epic gunfights. The boxed set has two editions of the film, both of which attempt to restore the film to Peckinpah's original vision. This is a film which improves with every viewing.

Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and The Ballad of Cable Hogue are both quality films as well. Only time prevents me from writing another couple of paragraphs on these as well.

Overall a great boxed set, with many interesting extras as well.",1231891200,,1606,4.585365853658536

1194341,4,B000006FNL,"I enjoyed The Ballad of Cable Hogue alot. It's quite a wonderful, lesser-known cinematic gem from 1970 and certainly not your typical western, which is a good thing. Out of all of director Sam Peckinpah's numerous westerns, this one is probably the most viewer-friendly and identifiable.

The story concerns titular frontiersman Cable Hogue (the great Jason Robards) doing his best to live out a minimalist existence while resisting change out on the western Arizona/Nevada plains in the very last days of the waning Old West in 1908. When we first meet him in the film's opening, he's betrayed by his two former partners, Bowen and Taggart (Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones, respectively) who steal his mule and provisions and leave him to die out in the blazing sun of the vast Arizona desert. He stumbles around dehydrated for four days close to death until he is saved by miraculously discovering water from a natural underground spring close to a regularly traveled wagon route. With the help of supplies dropped off to him from the passing wagons and stagecoaches, he decides that instead of leaving the desert behind, he will instead stay with the spring he has discovered and build it up into his very own little pitt-stop-style oasis in the desert, so other thristy travelers and wanderers passing through the area will have a place to stop and drink. Along the way, Cable is befriended and assisted by a lascivious preacher, Joshua Sloan (David Warner) and a feisty prostitute, Hildy (Stella Stevens), from a local, nearby town who dreams of the big, upscale life in San Francisco.

Early on he even stakes a claim and gets a bank loan on the land and spring and eventually even builds it up into an impressive little hitching post complete with a cabin, horse pens, rattlesnakes and a picnic area and watering spring. Pretty soon, customers from all over are stopping by Cable's now bustling and thriving little watering hole and pitt-stop. He eventually starts making good profits and becomes a legitimate, locally well-known businessman. He even dubs his oasis as Cable Springs, a cinematic implication that this watering hole was the foundation of what eventually became the modern-day city. Interestingly enough, Cable Hogue's primary motive for starting the oasis is not profit, but a patient revenge strategy in knowing the fact that his two afforementioned former comrades are still out there and will eventually and unsuspectingly drop by for a drink at some point. That's when Cable Hogue will be ready for them! Will he have his retribution on the two no-good weasels who left him for dead? You'll just have to watch and see.

It's an interesting and original little story, with good humor and characterization throughout. Jason Robards provides an excellent, gently wry performance and his character of Cable Hogue is a man with passions we can feel and understand. It's fairly safe to say that The Ballad of Cable Hogue is the most likeable and watchable of Sam Peckinpah's films, especially to the casual viewer. Unlike Peckinpah's other western features, the focus here is less on action-violence and more on characterization, which should make it a good introductory film for those new to or not as familiar with Sam Peckinpah's normally gritty style. It also even has a few poignant elements here and there, namely that of people's attitudes in the very first days of the 20th Century toward the progress and changing landscapes of the American West, a theme that was recurrent in many of Sam Peckinpah's westerns. Overall, a great, enjoyable film that's still worth a view.",1220140800,3,3599,4.995

Recently I bought a copy of the DVD and watched it again and I think it is better than I remembered it being, which is always a nice surprise.
Peckinpah's noted fixation on extreme violence isn't really present here, to any notable degree; in fact this film is rather sweet, or at least bitter-sweet.  There is the obligatory killing or two but they're rather incidental.
Robard's performance is excellent as to be expected, but then so is everyone else's. One thing about Sam was that he had an eye for characters.
Unfortunately he didn't have much of an ear for music. I've long noted that in nearly all of his films the soundtracks are awful and this one is no exception. The tunes are intended to be mellow and invocative but in reality are maudlin and syrupy. In the end they don't do much damage and I'm sure that there are folks out there who feel quite differently about the music than I do.
Still it is an interesting film and it does have ""staying power"". In the final analysis it may be one of Peckinpah's finer efforts.",1192579200,,1196,4.411764705882353

-Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, a story that's much of betrayal . Pat Garret betrays his old friend but you still feel bad for him because you know it wasn't a decision that was easy to make. The all around tone of the film was right. Sam Peckinpah even makes a cameo appearance, and it's a sad scene as well.

-The Ballad Of Cable Hogue, a story of simple man . Not a greedy. It's  about love and the ways of life. It kind of shows the start of a decline of once was the west. It's my favorite film of the set.

-The Wild Bunch, Definitely the standard for all American westerns. It's a brutal and heart breaking western film. Has to do alot with betrayal and decisions made in life. Standing by those decisions and even loyality.
My second favorite film in the set.

1194361,3,B000006FNL,"This light-hearted Western romance displays little of the violence for which Peckinpah is famous.  Judging from the tagline, you'ld think that this was a simple film about revenge, but it is, in fact, an unusual love story and a tale of a man looking to define his life.  Cable Hogue (played by Jason Robards) is abandoned by his comrades in the desert and left to die.  He stumbles upon an unknown spring and survives.  It turns out that the spring is also on an important stagecoach route, so he ultimately makes a fortune by making this watering hole a regular stop of the stage.  All the while he is waiting for his former comrades to drop by.  In the meantime, he falls in with a lascivious priest and in love with a prostitute. An entertaining, and at times, hilarious film, but certainly not the all-time classic that some of the other reviewers would lead you to believe.  This film definitely has the post-Easy Rider, 70s type angst overlaying the entire story.  The characters are searching for something in their life, but they aren't sure what it is.  Some type of meaning perhaps?  Would they even recognize it if they found it?  Perhaps only on their deathbed.  Does Cable ultimately find fulfillment with great wealth, love, and revenge?  The word Ballad in the title is appropriate, as this is really a ballad about Cable Hogue's life.

Cable Hogue found water where it wasn't - and thus begins ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" (1970). Jason Robards delivers one of his best performances, similar to the character he played in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1969), in a film that is perhaps Sam Peckinpah's best!

Near death by thirst, Cable finally stumbles upon water, and begins an enterprise called ""Cable Springs""; a reststop for weary travelers along the stagecoach trail. Once in town he falls in love with Hildy, ""the ladiest damn'd lady"" - a whore nonetheless, while befriending a wandering preacher who expounds in theories of life and love. Peckinpah's lyrical poetry is extraordinary as it is both charming and fascinating; brought to life with the wonderful photography by Lucien Ballard, and the heartwarming score by Richard Gillis.

1194374,4,B000006FNL,"Sam Peckinpah's ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue,"" although still very much concerned with the sere and yellow, offers light, or, at least, lighter relief...

Thirst does very much play a part in his history at the outset.... Robbed and abandoned by his partners (Strother Martin and L. O. Jones) in the desert, Jason Robards is saved from certain death by finding water from a spring... And out of this discovery comes a sort of success story...

The spring is handy to the stagecoach route and so, assisted by a banker in the nearby of an unexciting town (Deaddog is the indicative name), he sets up a 'halt' on the trail... In Deaddog he also chums up with the local whore (Stella Stevens). And always aiding and encouraging him is a mischievous preacher (David Warner) who is ever willing and able to give more than spiritual comfort to the female members of his flock...

The old fellow's project prospers; the sympathetic prostitute pays him a fleeting but rewarding visit; he eventually gets revenge on one of the partners who left him to die... And the happiest ending seems to purr into view in the form of a splendid car carrying the good-time gal who has finally decided to settle down with him...

Allegory? Or straight romantic comedy? One is never sure but it's a warm and vivid film with a distinctive flavor that teases the sense of taste... Whether the style is peak Peckinpah is another matter...",1166659200,3,1408,4.711382113821138

1194377,5,B000006FNL,"The Ballad of Cable Hogue is buried treasure - an outstanding film by a legendary director with brilliant performances that is still little known and rarely seen. Sam Peckinpah made it just months after his groundbreaking film, The Wild Bunch, and both films deal with the same topic - the end of the western frontier, although in radically different ways. While The Wild Bunch is a violently realistic film about a breed of western gunmen who had outlived their day, The Ballad of Cable Hogue is a stylized fable, by turn tender, dark, comic, and tragic that depicts the last days of another sort of western archetypal man. It may be that the film's resistance to easy categorization (is it a comedy? a tragic love story? a morality tale of revenge? a musical?) is responsible for its continued obscurity, but I find it an element of its greatness, and concur with Peckinpah, who characterized the film as part Keystone Cops, part Sartre's The Fly, and considered it his favorite of all his movies.

There are many reasons to love this film, including its stunning scenery of awesome, big sky desert landscapes, and a unique, lilting soundtrack with songs that become mysteriously etched in your mind. Yet its foremost strength is its brilliant performances from an impressive cast. Jason Robards plays the title role, brilliantly rendering the tough as boot leather yet vulnerable Hogue as charming and totally unforgettable. Stella Stevens delivers the crowning performance of her career as Hildy, a prostitute who aspires to go to San Francisco to become the ""ladiest damn'd lady"", yet unaccountably falls in love with the desert rat Hogue. Stevens and Robards together create an utterly believable screen romance that not only crackles with passion, but conveys real depths of caring and emotion. David Warner adds color and comic relief to the story as Josh, a lascivious traveling preacher who becomes side-kick, foil, and nemesis to the no nonsense Hogue. Several great character actors all at the top of their form, including Strother Martin, Slim Pickens, and L.Q. Jones, round out this first rate cast.

This DVD release includes several excellent special features. There is a mini feature called The Ladiest Damn'd Lady: An Afternoon With Actress Stella Stevens, in which Stevens talks about her career, Director Sam Peckinpah (she didn't much like him), and her experiences working on The Ballad of Cable Hogue. Also included are trailer galleries from five Peckinpah movies - Ride the High Country, The Wild Bunch, The Ballad of Cable Hogue, The Getaway, and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. Most importantly, however, is an outstanding commentary track featuring four Peckinpah scholars. Their commentary covers the symbolism and philosophy of the movie, Peckinpah's filming technique, and the movie's relationship to Peckinpah's larger body of work. Unlike many commentary tracks that seem to add little value, this excellent track is both entertaining and useful, and leaves you wanting to watch the movie yet again with the new perspectives you have gained from it.

The Ballad of Cable Hogue is a film that will stick with you, and one you will want to revisit frequently. It is not only my favorite Sam Peckinpah film, it is one of my top five all time favorite Westerns. If your Western collection lacks this quirky gem, it is not yet complete, so go discover it for yourself.

1194379,4,B000006FNL,"THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE (1970, Warners) is one of four titles in SAM PECKINPAH'S THE LEGENDARY WESTERNS COLLECTION.  All four titles go a long way toward placing Peckinpah in the pantheon of western filmmakers, especially CABLE HOGUE.  It is Peckinpah's most relaxed and lyrical and romantic movie, with wonderful performances by Jason Robards as frontiersman Cable Hogue and Stella Stevens as a likeable whorehouse madam named Hildy.  Way out of time in 1908, Cable is left for dead by two nasty outlaws (Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones), then discovers a water hole.  Soon he is in town filing a township claim, making friends with Hildy, and working with a preacher named Joshua (David Warner) to create the little town of Cable Springs.  He gets his revenge by happily selling water to thirsty desert travelers.  Peckinpah made this neglected masterwork right after THE WILD BUNCH, and it was a box office and critical disaster from people expecting more of THE WILD BUNCH.  But Peckinpah evidently liked shifting gears because he then did STRAW DOGS (1971) and JUNIOR BONNER (1972) back to back.  CABLE HOGUE has gorgeous photography by the great Lucien Ballard, a Peckinpah regular; Robards and Stevens give fabulous performances; the ending is very ironic and memorable; and I cannot get the instrumental score by Jerry Goldsmith and glorious theme song ""Let Tomorrow Be the Song I Sing"" by Richard Gillis out of my head days later.

1194380,4,B000006FNL,"I saw this during its theatrical release and loved it. When I purchased the boxed set of Peckinpah westerns, it was the first I played. How has it held up? I would have given it five stars back then; today just four (which ain't shabby). The difference represents the effect of 30+ years on my sensibilities more than theatrical viewing versus DVD. The cast features excellent performances: Jason Robards is perfect as Cable; David Warner effective as the preacher; and Peckinpah stalwarts Strother Martin, L. Q. Jones, and Slim Pickins are always interesting. The clunker, for me, was Stella Stevens. The whore-with-a-heart-of-gold is a character type with which I have a problem. It's not a problem of morality; it's a problem of reality. The problem here is compounded by the choice of Miss Stevens. It's not her acting - her performance is quite good - it's her appearance. While the scruffy appearances of the other characters place them plausibly in turn-of-the-century Arizona, Miss Stevens's appearance screams 1960s Southern California. I would have found a less attractive actress with a harder edge more effective in the role. The problem here may be mine alone (Miss Stevens's performance was widely praised); that had I viewed the movie more as a fantasy, Miss Stevens would not have posed the problem she did. Overall, it is a quibble with what is otherwise an immensely enjoyable film.",1142208000,4,1400,5.038793103448276

1194392,4,B000006FNL,"The new version of Pat Garrett, which has the scene where James Coburn visits his wife, restored to the first act is in no way an improvement over the last version.  The previous version which was derived from a previewed version of the film is vastly superior.  There was a  reason why this scene was cut from the preview version, and that is because it plain didn't work, and killed the first act stone dead at that point.  One has to believe that Roger Spottiswoode knew what he was doing when he prepared the ""preview version"", he was, after all, one of the editorial team on this film.

Having said this, at least the earlier version of Pat Garret is included.  If you have not seen this film before, watch that one first!

As to Ride the High Country, it would be nice if the telecine operators of this and the previous Laser Disc version of the film  would actually listen to the dialog as well as just looking at the pictures.  There are around five scenes that were shot ""day for night"" that the telecine transfer has managed to turn back into normal day scenes, which makes them seem kind of ridiculous!  People just don't sit round a camp fire and talk about where they are going to sleep, in broad daylight!

""Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid"" was a big disappointment.  James Couburn is good as Garrett, but there isn't much of a plot and Kris Kristofferson is terrible as Billy.

All in all I thought the collection a good buy, and I will watch ""The Wild Bunch"" many times as it is a cut above most of the rest of the westerns.",1141171200,2,432,4.2317073170731705
1194394,4,B000006FNL,"Sam Peckinpah is known for his westerns, and here's another one.  However (this being the second western of his I've seen), I get the distinct feeling from him that he had a little more on his mind than genre.  I found Wild Bunch to be a heavily post-modern approach to the western story, making completely brutal characters out of archetypal heroes and turning typical gunfights into gritty massacres (like the end.  Everyone romanticizes it, but it's really just four really crazy but reserved men going into a town and shooting everyone, evil and innocent alike, with a huge machine gun until they're finally put to their own deaths.  Nothing heroic in it).

This movie is more modernist, I'd say, with a bizarre sort of humor.  There's a nymphomaniacal priest, a bunch of characters that basically don't take each other seriously, and then there's our protagonist, who is ""not a good man, and not a bad man, but a man.""  Really that's all he is.  You don't sympathize with him, but then again you don't hate him.  He's just sort of there, in a recognizable and profound way.

Peckinpah himself shows his visual cunning in this film, with acute transitions that really place a bizarre timeline to the film and, interestingly enough, a great sense of zoom.  Zoom, of all things.  I mean... zoom!  Who really makes an entire movie an artform out of just that?  Well, Sam does, I guess.

Both westerns of his I've seen were about the end of the western era, and thus I think he himself is trying to end the genre itself by completely changing the contexts of the heroes we regarded in such films.  Cable Hogue is a great rag-to-riches story... but in the end who cares?  He's neither completely a man of the desert or a hero of the West.  He is confused by the approach of technology, but basically embraces it, and doesn't begrudge it its ending of his life and style.  This is VERY opposed to what I see most filmmakers do with the form, classically and contemperarily.  From the spaghetti westerns that idealized our great hero dominators of the frontier to the Kevin Costner laments of pain of the Native Americans who ended up losing their land, The Wild West is still, at heart, a romantic and amazing place like that out of a fairytale, Disney or Grimm.  peckinpah's West is a blank one, a dry one... and a humanist one.

1194397,4,B000006FNL,"Sam Peckinpah defines the word ""maverick."" He came out of Hollywood with his own unique brand of filmmaking that often clashed with studio executives. This resulted in a career of tough, uncompromising movies that were either loved or hated - there was no in-between with Peckinpah's movies. This collection feature some of the man's most memorable westerns and if there is a theme that unites them all it is the continuing pre-occupation with over-the-hill professionals existing in a world that they no longer belong in and are given one last shot at glory and redemption.

All of the films in this collection feature audio commentaries by Peckinpah biographers/experts Nick Redman, Paul Seydor, Garner Simmons and David Weddle. For the Ride the High Country DVD, they start things off by pointing out that what makes the film so interesting is how Peckinpah plays with generic conventions. They identify his major themes (i.e. appearance vs. reality, death of the west, and so on) and analyze them.

""A Justified Life: Sam Peckinpah and the High Country"" documents Peckinpah's life and career. His sister tells all kinds of stories of their childhood. He and his family lived in a remote area much like the high country of the movie.

On the commentary for The Wild Bunch, as with their other tracks, they impart a lot of information about Peckinpah and the film. . They also talk about how the level of violence was so shocking for its time and how viscerally audiences reacted to it. Not surprisingly, the movie divided critics and audiences alike. These guys are all astute observers and provide an essential commentary for Peckinpah fans.

Also included are several documentaries including ""The Wild Bunch: An Album in Montage"" that takes a look at how this classic movie was made and even features vintage, behind-the-scenes footage. Over this footage and clips from the movie is narration that quotes Peckinpah and the cast, providing a unique look at this movie.

""Sam Peckinpah's West: Legacy of a Hollywood Renegade"" is an in-depth, feature length documentary on the man and his films, covering most of his classics. Famous folk like Paul Schrader, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Madsen and Benicio Del Toro comment on his work and what it means to them. This doc illustrates the man's diverse body of work and provides a fascinating look at what makes him so important.

""An Excerpt From A Simple Adventure Story: Sam Peckinpah, Mexico and The Wild Bunch."" Peckinpah's daughter and a documentary crew revisited the Mexican town where her father shot most of the movie. It is an emotional, nostalgic journey for all involved.

""Never-Before-Seen-Outtakes"" is a montage of various scenes from the movie set to music.

On the commentary for The Ballad of Cable Hogue, the participants describe the film as Peckinpah's most religious effort with numerous references to the Bible and Hogue's morality adhering to the Old Testament. This is a good track with an excellent analysis of the movie.

""The Ladiest Damn'd Lady"" features an interview with actress Stella Stevens who starred in Hogue opposite Jason Robards. Of course, she gives her impressions of Peckinpah and what it was like working with him.

There is an audio commentary for the new version of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid with the participants talking about the differences between it and the 1988 Version. They explain the changes that were made and how they affect the movie's tone, etc. This is a very informative lesson in the nature of editing.

Also included is a commentary track for the 1988 Version clarifying that this is the cut of the film that Peckinpah turned into the studio and was previewed in front of an audience but was not the director's final version. The film was the victim of a rushed schedule hence Peckinpah was unable to assemble his final cut.

""Deconstructing Pat and Billy"" examines how this new cut was assembled and also documents Peckinpah's conflict with the studio. His assistant at the time recounts the troubled shoot - the location they shot at had very primitive irrigation and everyone got really sick. However, some of the information in this featurette repeats what was covered in greater depth on the commentary tracks.

""One Foot in the Groove: Remembering Sam Peckinpah and Other Things."" Kris Kristofferson is interviewed and talks about how he became a musician and then an actor and his eventually collaboration with Peckinpah.

Kristofferson also performs ""One for the Money"" and ""Sam's Song"" that he wrote while making Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. They were about Peckinpah.",1139270400,3,4598,5.017060367454068
1194398,4,B000006FNL,"Right wing orthodox Catholic monarchists might wonder what it is in Peckinpah's films that are so captivating.  It doesn't hurt that in the film under discussion, Hogue is crushed beneath the wheels of modernity's hateful, deathless carriage.  Maybe it's the tribalism of his main characters who, while casting off society, remain loyal (or almost loyal) to God and nation.  Or maybe it's the Percy-esque element of his films.  Strong and independent but terribly flawed men transformed by beautiful women.  Is she merely a woman, or are her mysterious movements akin to Grace?  I don't know, but I'm pretty sure Grace doesn't have Hildy embroidered on her drawers.  Oh well.  In spite of the sometimes laughable script and terrible music, The Ballad of Cable Hogue proves a sturdy and scenic bridge between the early, almost sugary (in comparison), Peckinpah, and the cynical but not hopeless Peckinpah of Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and Cross of Iron.  Perhaps there are no heroes, but there are still good men.

1194399,5,B000006FNL,"Another long-awaited Peckinpah DVD, courtesy of the newly-released Peckinpah Westerns collection.  Rather than take up space recounting plot, etc, I will focus on the disc. The film looks great, with its widescreen desert vistas, and offers a commentary track that does a lot to boost appreciation for the film as a whole, and for the many contributors to the effort.

In fact, the film plus the commentary are good enough to overcome the unfortunate addition of a weak, rather counter-productive ""extra"" featuring Stella Stevens.  She appears to have loved the film also, and loved working on it, and has kind things to say about her fellow actors.  Sam, however, rates only cruel, dismissive insults from the woman, which only comes off the worse for the fact that he isn't around to defend himself.  Less interview than monologue - it's just Stella talking, no interviewer, no one to maybe question why, if she found the man so repugnant, did she want so much to work with him on another picture?

While it would have been nice to have a more worthy extra, Sam's poignant desert ballad does quite well on its own.",1137715200,10,1116,4.816753926701571
1194400,4,B000006FNL,"This easygoing, sometimes lyrical, film from Sam Peckinpah is easy to like but I can't say it's wholly successful.  You have to give credit, though, to Peckinpah for tackling offbeat material that was probably a hard sell to the studios.  Imagine the meeting he had with the flacks describing a Western, with little gunplay, about a desert rat who stumbles onto a waterhole and bides his time mining the lode and making time with his prostitute girlfriend.  It has no reason to work but for the most part it does.  Credit has to go to star Jason Robards for making Cable Hogue an engaging character.  You can see the span of Hogue's life by just studying the landscape of Robards' face.  What is also touchingly believable is Hogue's relationship with the beautiful callgirl and credit there has to go to co-star Stella Stevens.  One of the more indelible images I take from the film is Robards bathing Stevens while they sing ""Butterfly Morning"".  Where the film falls short is it does meander at times and the occasional stab at slapstick misses the mark.  Peckinpah is fairly or unfairly tagged as a director of violent fare.  Anybody seeing this film or ""Junior Bonner"" would come away with a different impression.  ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" is an essential piece of the complex puzzle that was Sam Peckinpah.",1137283200,4,1315,4.774336283185841
1194401,5,B000006FNL,"No question about the greatness of this movie, but I have a couple of comments about the DVD. Firstly, the color balance shifted dramatically between, and even within, scenes. I turned down the saturation on my DVD player as much as possible, but flesh tones were far too red. Since it's a brand new player, I put in some old DVDs, and they looked fine, so I didn't tinker with the display (a front projector). The print shown on the Western channel has much more muted color, which actually looks better. Also, the DVD says ""matted "" to produce the original theatrical version. I saw the original theatrical version, and this isn't it. The reason I remember is that Stella Stevens disrobes in Cable's shack with her lovely posterior to the camera. This was in the original version (something you remember after decades) as well as in the full-frame version on the Western channel. It isn't here - the bottom of the frame is the top of her bottom, so to speak. The movie isn't censored (the other nudity is intact), so this must be the blind application of a matte, probably cutting off 1/4 or so of the total image. I don't remember the original aspect ratio, but this looks very much like a FS film matted to produce a WS film. Perhaps not, but that's what it looks like. All the other films in the Peckinpah package say anamorphic widescreen, except this one, so something funny is going on. Why matte a WS picture?",1137110400,4,1418,4.54296875
1194432,5,B000006FNL,"Sam Peckinpah, pretty much the template for your rugged iconoclast, was a masterful director, responsible for some great, violent, bleak, but oddly graceful films, such as ""The Getaway"", ""Straw Dogs"", etc. but he had a special way with Westerns, and this set contains some fine examples...""The Wild Bunch"" - its reputation precedes it, obviously, but it truly is one of the great Westerns, if not the greatest...""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" is a flawed, yet deeply rewarding cinematic experience, featuring the acting debut (I believe) of one Robert Zimmerman. Well, what can I say? I prefer his soundtrack contributions to his acting in the flick, but still, he ain't bad...""Cable Hogue""  and ""High Country"" are fine genre exercises as well...Peckinpah's cinematic vision really was unique and about much more than violence and his influence is widely felt today....",1137110400,5,870,5.258992805755396
1194433,5,B000006FNL,"We finally get treated to pristine quality discs of what are, for me, the greatest group of Westerns ever made. By any filmmaker. Ever. Great widescreen renderings of beautiful works of art previously relegated, with the exception of Wild Bunch, to full screen vhs that did not begin to do them justice. P. G. & Billy the Kid is a dvd revelation, offering two different cuts to enjoy and mull over. Yes, the extras are a mixed bag, with those attached to Wild Bunch providing the best of the group, although the commentaries by these Peckinpah scholars are worthwhile on all 4 films. All I can say is, it certainly is about time to provide quality transfers of some of the finest films from this brilliant, uncompromising filmmaker. Often imitated but never equalled, there will never be another Sam Peckinpah. Wild Bunch is not just my favorite Western, it has to stand as my favorite movie of all time, and the other three aren't far behind. It is still amazing to me that, for the 1994 reissue to theatres of The Wild Bunch, the film-lovers at MPAA almost slapped their infamous NC-17 on this classic Western, which had been made 25 YEARS previously. In 1994, mind you, these champions of morality and good taste in movies were calling THIS film a piece of pornography. Talk about a film with astonishing powers that cannot be eroded by the passing years!

1194439,5,B000006FNL,"Although often ignored by reviewers and cinema historians, ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue"" is one of the Great American Films.  Sam Peckinpah grasped the essential American story:  a man who by luck, hard work, and persistence creates his own economic empire, small though it might be.  But, the story goes beyond that:  it raises the questions of revenge:  what it is we expect to achieve, and what alternatives there are.  There are two powerful love stories here:  Cable Hogue and the local prostitute (Stella Stevens) and the friendship of two oddly mismatched men:  Hogue and the itinerant preacher who comes to admire the man he originally hopes to deceive.  Jason Robards is at the top of his form, but so is the entire cast, and the cinematography is quietly gorgeous without being intrusive.  I can only paraphrase the last line of the movie:  ""Take this film, but don't take it lightly.""  It is a great movie.",1127433600,5,915,4.794871794871795
1194440,4,B000006FNL,"The reputation of director Sam Peckinpah as a director of ultra-violent action movies is not completely an accurate one.  It is true that many of his films are violent and provocative, but they do more than just spill the blood and guts around.  Still, that ""Bloody Sam"" reputation of his has tended to overshadow other very worthwhile projects of his that are far less violent.  One such example is his congenial 1970 western THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE.

In this film, Jason Robards is Cable Hogue, a desert rat left to die in the Nevada flatlands when his two unscrupulous partners (L.Q. Jones; Strother Martin) overpower him and abscond with the only canteen on them.  Vowing to get revenge on them, Robards wanders the desert for three days, calling to God to send him water.  At the end of his rope, caught in a sandstorm, Robards finally hits that magical water--in a part of the world where it isn't supposed to be.

Subsequently managing to open up his own stagecoach rest stop, Cable Springs, Robards becomes very chummy with a lecherous preacher (David Warner), and he also falls in love with a prostitute (Stella Stevens).  But all this good fortune of his is overshadowed by his desire to get back at Martin and Jones for abandoning him, and his suspicious and somewhat uncouth nature bothers Stevens, and causes Warner to question his goodness.

Without a whole lot of killing, and very little violence to speak of, THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE finds Peckinpah managing to mine his favorite theme, people in a West that is changing too fast for them, and doing so with a goodly amount of humor, along with a period-style score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The musical numbers don't necessarily work as well as they should, but that doesn't detract too greatly from the story.  Robards, Stevens, and Warner give very good performances here; and Martin and Jones, part of Peckinpah's ""Usual Suspects"" stock company, are as caddy here as they were in THE WILD BUNCH.  One thing that perhaps is deceptive about THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE is the 'R' rating that was originally placed on it in 1970--these days, despite some nudity, the film would at worst get a 'PG-13' rating.

Filmed exclusively on location in the Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada, and at Apache Junction, Arizona, THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE is one of Peckinpah's easier-going films and, like his later 1972 rodeo film JUNIOR BONNER, showed that there was more to this irascible Hollywood reprobate than bullets, blood squibs, and violent death.  Highly recommended.",1122422400,4,2532,4.831018518518518

Loved the cast, loved the offbeat characters and storytelling, loved the ""community"" that forms in the last gasp of the Western frontier.  It's an affectionate take on the humanity so often missing in shoot-em-up Westerns.

Plus, Stella Stevens is absolutely stunning.  She's photographed in such a way that she doesn't look like she's wearing a molecule of makeup, making her look like a natural knockout.
