8764187,5,B01GWDUER2,"I'm not a Power Ranger fan, but I like how the shows are crafted. I also respect how long the Japanese and American shows have been going on--some better than others.
Akibaranger is the show that I've always wanted. It combines the production style (monsters, rubber suits, practical effects, etc.) with a better story. The show follows delusional people that believe they are rangers, or are becoming rangers, or spoiler alert--both.
This keeps all of the wackiness and oddness from the kids show but packages it in a story that I found refreshing with characters that I found charming.
And the second season? As good or better as weird or weirder.",1499212800,,649,4.8558558558558556
