1881765,1,B00009ATIX,"If there's one film I thought would never be re-made by Hollywood then it's Solaris. You can't say their Philistines, can you? Here's the lowdown for curious fans of Tarkovsky's original. Soderbergh's naff version replaces Hari with a Sloan-ranger. Brit readers think Tara P-T in 'Celebrity get me out of here'. McElhone, poor lass, is hopeless. Being an American production there has to be a murder mystery included (Philistines!) I half expected Columbo to pop his head around the door only to be tapped on the shoulder by another Columbo saying ""oh, and one more thing."" Or maybe two. Half way through, Basil exposition drops in shrouded in darkness to fill Americans in on plot details they may be missing. You know, give 'em a prod. There's a conjuring trick or two and finally, a fortune cookie ending. Mix in what suspiciously sounds like David Bowie's Subterraneans and Bob's your uncle. Well, only if he's dead. It's mystifying why Soderbergh should want to remake this. No takers for Citizen Kane or Battleship Potemkin, right? Those who think Tarkovsky's film is 'perfect' won't need it. Those in that group who are curiosity killed the catters but are worried that the new version may intrude upon their thoughts while watching the Tarkovsky should probably steer well clear of this atrocity. I didn't, but I'll live.
Special features: Well, you get a lot of thumping techno music and speeded up camera in the 'Behind The Scenes' specials that is risibly at odds with the subject matter. Cameron, never a man to retire from hyperbole, announces grandly that there has not been a film like this in twenty years, neatly leaving the original 'Solaris' outside the loop. Surprisingly, Tarkovsky's celebrated classic is not mentioned at all. Or perhaps we shouldn't be the least surprised.",1058918400,7,1796,4.99
1881766,5,B00009ATIX,"When most people ask me why I chose Solaris as the top film of 2002 out of a year that had BLOCKBUSTER written all over it, I round it up into one simple sentance; ""This is a SCI-FI film that shows man's relationship to God. Before you start thinking I'm some religious zealot, let me assure you that I mean what I say only in a latteral sense. Kelvin's character is that of a man who creates another being just by the will of his mind, by a love that he can neither control nor respect. Clooney finds Kelvin's quiet dispair with gusto. But it is the two women in this movie, Nastasha McElhone (whom I loved since The Truman Show)and Viola Davis that are the show-stealers. McElhone as Rheya has the hardest job in the movie, especially near the end when she comes to realize the woman she was. Most actresses would overact in these situations, but not her. She plays it with a calmness that fits the character and Kelvin's tone. Viola Davis has the role that could have been easily typecasted as The Witch In Space. But she remains the voice of logic in the story when it seems everything is going to Disneyland. At this time, I think it's fair to mention Steven Soddeburgh's contribution. This is the perfect follow-up to his epic Traffic. And there you have it, just a little of essay I could write on this movie, explaining how this is THE BEST FILM of 2002",1058313600,5,1361,4.383399209486166
1881767,4,B00009ATIX,"Psychiatrist Chris Kelvin is sent to a space station to investigate why the crew has cut off contact with Earth.  When he gets there, he discovers that the crew is receiving ""visitors,"" and soon he gets his own visitor: his wife who has been dead for years.  The crew believes that the planet, whom they believe to be a living entity, is the cause of this, but why?
Solaris is not your run of the mill Sci Fi film, for which I am greatful.  For once, a mainstream SciFi film uses scifi as a vehicle for ideas instead of action (something that SF literature has been doing for many decades, Solaris was written in the early 60s).  This is both a philisophical film and a love story.  It's also the most realistic alien I have ever seen in a film; completely enigmatic.  We think it's intelligent (this is based on some comments early in the film, when Chris first sees Rheya), but we can never be sure.  And perhaps Solaris is thinking the same thing about us.  The drawback to a ""realistic"" alien is that we the viewer cannot learn anything about it which leaves us with a good number of questions that are not answered.  Indeed, it really isn't necessary to answer those questions as Solaris exists (within the context of the story) only to set the stage.
So if you're looking for laser beams and space battles, steer clear.  If you are looking for something to stimulate your mind, then this is definitely worthwhile.",1058140800,6,1419,4.5078125
1881768,5,B00009ATIX,"I was not very convinced when I went to see the movie because I did not think that George Clooney was a good choice for the main part. Clooney carries with him this stereotype of a modern Don Juan that does not lend itself well for a drama such as Solaris.
As soon as the story got going, however, Don Juan was totally erased both from my mind and from the scared psychologist walking the corridors of the space station.
I'm not trying to sell Clooney. Actually I think that all the actors playing characters present on the space station did an outstanding job. This is one of the elements that make this movie a success. Every single expression, slight movement, silence, carries true meaning.
The special effects that bring the outer space and planet background into the film are done well enough that I didn't notice imperfections. I think that Steven Soderbergh was right at keeping this aspect of the movie secondary, otherwise it might have become a disturbing element. This said, I enjoyed the nice shots at Solaris added here and there because they contributed to the overall mystery.
And the music. It's haunting. I kept looking for a pattern but couldn't find it. However, the music seeped through my being while I was busy with the pictures and really got to me. I would hesitate buying the soundtrack, by the way, because I'm afraid that the sound without the images may not work so well. But the marriage of the two is one of the best I have experienced.
The pace is slow but I kept having to catch my breath, so captured I was.
To conclude, I would guess that not everybody will like this movie. I brought my date with me and it turned out to be a mistake. She was annoyed. So this may be turn out to be a case of all or nothing; you will either hate it or love it.",1057017600,25,1779,4.410334346504559
1881769,5,B00009ATIX,"Steven Soderbergh's elegant Solaris is one of the best movies of this past year. It's a thoughtful tone poem on the nature of love and the mysteries of mortality and time. There is an assuredness in the direction, a confidence in the performances and a visual artistry in the camera direction. The maturity of the relationship between the two leads is refreshing - no cliches here. Soderbergh never makes assumptions about the intelligence of the audience, which is a relief after so many spoon-feeding Hollywood sci-fi films.
I did see Tarkovsky's original Solaris and I find this version a lot more satisfying - thank goodness Soderberg did not recreate the endless scenes of old bearded philosophers arguing with each other for hours. It was a risk to make this film and sadly, audiences did not support it to the success it deserved, but for those who appreciate intelligent, thought -provoking films, this one will linger with you long after the last credits roll.",1056931200,6,969,4.950920245398773
1881770,5,B00009ATIX,"It seems as if this movie is one of those love it or hate it ones. Both sides of those opinions seem to be well explained in other reviews, so I will be brief.
The silence, slow pace, wonderful score, dream scenes, unspoken words, symbolism with the door nob and Solaris, the character Snow, and the real meaning of the film (""We want mirrors"" even if those mirrors are inaccurate) add up to a film that is not typically made by Hollywood.
You can compare this film to the book or to the Tarkovsky version, but all three were made by different people for different reasons, therefore I am comparing it as a movie against other movies I have viewed, and I think it's beautiful.",1055030400,3,676,4.416
1881771,5,B00009ATIX,"With the way that movie storylines are these days, it was refreshing and elightening to know that a science fiction film that dealt with metaphysical and cerebral matters was being released around November of 2002 AD. Especially the fact that Kentucky native George Clooney was the lead actor in the production, along with the lovely British actress Natascha McElhone. In many ways, this was more entertaining and watchable than your average Star Wars and Star Trek film.
Much like 2001, but with some romantic overtones, Steven Soderbergh's Solaris is an interesting mix of metaphysical and cerebral science fiction, with a love story thrown in. Not only was the storyline very solid and multi-dimensional, the sets, the costumes, the special visual effects, and soundtrack were all beautiful. The actors and actresses did a remarkable job in the roles, along with the material they were given.
Based on Polish science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem's novel, Solaris tells the story of a 21st Century psychologist who receives a message from a scientist friend of his on a space station orbiting a mysterious planet named Solaris. Chris Kelvin, the psychologist is asked by his friend if he could come to the space station named Prometheus and find out what is going on. Apparently, some strange and unusual incidents have been occuring.
Still recovering from the tragic death of his wife, Kelvin journeys to the space station and discovers the fact that his friend has mysteriously died, one of the scientists is acting irrationally, and the other is frightened. While determining the cause of all of the events, Chris is suddenly visited by an image of his deceased wife. From there, Chris and the two surviving scientists determine that the ocean planet they are orbiting his a sentient form of life that is recreating the images of those from a tragic moment in their past. As to why this alien intelligence is committing these acts, remains an unknown factor.
I haven't seen Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version of the film, so I really can't compare this film with the older version. I can say this, it helps to read the book first before viewing the film. I can honestly say that I enjoyed Soderbergh's version of Solaris. Not only does the film stay true to Lem's book in some levels, it also paints an interesting picture in Freudian terms. It states an interesting fact about how well do we know other people and at the same time how well we know ourselves. In all honesty, this was probably the best film out of 2002! It may have the qualities of a science fiction art house film, but it is still entertaining. One that I look forward to purchasing on DVD this summer.
If you enjoy science fiction that makes you think, instead of the ususal shoot them and blow them up types, then you will be pleased with Solaris. It will make you think and it will astound your mind.",1053475200,5,2874,4.819838056680162
1881772,2,B00009ATIX,"I didn't expect great things from the Soderbergh remake of Solaris. Being an avid Andrei Tarkovsky fan, I was always of the firm belief that no remake could surpass the intensity and beauty of the original film, even with the much-lauded Steven Soderbergh / James Cameron(producer) partnership at the helm.
Psychologist Chris Kelvin is sent to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris, in order to investigate the strange happenings onboard. Upon arrival, he finds one of the crew dead from suicide, another isolated and unwelcoming, and the third appearing rather insane. Later, Kelvin realises that the planet is in fact sentient, being able to probe into its inhabitants' minds and recreate, in physical form, one's memories of people long lost to them. Soon he finds himself in the presence of his dead wife, who remembers events in their life together, but doesn't recall ever actually having those experiences. She is only part of the person she used to be, a manifested memory.
The film begins well enough but quickly descends into conceptual chaos. Where the original focused on the bounds of science and humanity, the remake is a simple-minded, if perplexing, love story. Where the original was thought provoking, heavy with desperate love and questions of conscience, the remake pretends to be all these things and then fails miserably with the ending, where everything is said instead of shown and stupid, redundant `twists' abound. It seems as though Soderbergh has been taking advice from Steven Spielberg who, as we all know, defines that a movie's not finished unless you tack on an extra half hour to ensure your sunshine and your puppies and your mandatory happily-ever-after.
Of course, the film is not completely without its merits. The directing is top-notch. The editing is pretty good in places. The score is great. The CG shots of Solaris are gorgeous. But that's all stuff on the surface. It's beauty without soul, the form of the original film with none of its substance. Tarkovsky would be rolling in his grave.
If you're after an intense action/romance blockbuster, wait for The Matrix sequels.
If you want a recent film with real substance, get The Hours instead.
If you are one of those annoying cinema-goers who always express your non sequitur views loudly at the expense of everybody else's abject exasperation, need to have a `deep' analysis of everything regardless of whether there really is any need, and like it when a film's themes are spelt out so that you can claim the insights as your own, then... by all means, get Solaris. Oh yeah, and those who like random, gratuitous shots of George Clooney's naked butt will not go away disappointed either.",1052697600,20,2691,4.99554565701559
1881773,2,B00009ATIX,"I found the movie incredibly dull. It was trying so hard to be Blade Runner, but it doesn't come anywhere close. Pretty much all the actors were miscast. I saw this movie immediately after I read the book, and that likely influenced my views towards the negative. This movie is an adaptation of the book in name only. It has loosely borrowed certain elements of the book and spun its own tale of despair and ""bittersweet"" romance. Spoilers: Kelvin's decision to stay behind and essentially perish in Solaris was very disappointing. The ending scene of a version of Rheya and Kelvin living a happily ever after in some Solarian-construct was mundane and unsatisfying. Simulation is not satisfying as reality-even if that is painful.",1506211200,,731,4.951219512195122
1881774,5,B00009ATIX,"One of my favorite movies of all time, I've watched it again and again. Part sci-fi, part drama, just an all around great movie.",1506124800,,128,4.375
1881775,5,B00009ATIX,"I saw this movie before I was aware of the films and novel that preceded it. I found it intriguing and beautiful, but didn't really grasp the significance of the story until I had watched it at least three times. Now I find I want to see it again and again. It's excellent on so many levels.

This movie tells its story in a way that seems driven more by emotion than anything else. There is little exposition. Dialogue is minimal but very effective. The acting here is very convincing and purposeful - a joy to watch. I consider it miles beyond the glum and depressed portrayals in the very good but overly-long 1972 film. The difficulty the characters have communicating with each other is exhausting and worth paying close attention to, because every little detail reveals something important. Clooney is especially compelling as Kelvin - full of nuance and immersive (easily the best role I've seen him play).

While I haven't read the Stanislaw Lem novel, I have seen the 1972 film and read about the book. They're all different. I'm concerned about finding a worthy English translation of the novel and wouldn't expect the films to necessarily tell the same story. Still, the new film is supposedly more faithful than its predecessors and tells a very focused story at a comfortable pace. The '72 version is full of introspective dialogue and long, drawn-out scenes, while the '02 film tells its story very economically, with surprisingly few words. The underlying themes involve the struggle to communicate and understand and explore the significance of memory. A fascinating subject, not just by itself but in how it translates to different media in different cultures.

There is a richness to Solaris that needs to be appreciated with multiple viewings. My kind of story and now one of my favorite movies. I'm still not sure what to make of the ending, but what a journey in getting there.

The soundtrack is excellent - hauntingly beautiful, sublime, and mysterious, just like the rest of the movie.",1501718400,,2009,4.8654970760233915

1881777,3,B00009ATIX,"Started out well and I loved the story line, but I could have thought up a better ending.  So so.",1497571200,,97,3.85
1881778,3,B00009ATIX,"Solaris is about a psychologist,Dr. Chris Kelvin, who is called into deep space due to mysterious happenings aboard a spacecraft orbiting a planet called Solaris.  Solaris is sending exact duplicates of people who have died from each crew member's life onto the ship and the crew is not handling the situation well at all.  These very human duplicates are so real that they don't understand how they got onboard and are confused themselves about who and what they are- so much so that some become quite disturbed!  By the time Dr. Kelvin gets to the spacecraft, his friend who had invited him to come, has committed suicide and no one knows why.  Dr. Kelvin eventually meets with his own poltergeist- but I won't spoil that for you.  Suffice it to say that 'it' sends him on an emotional rollercoaster that makes him question everything in his life- even his memories.  One of the crew figures out a way to destroy these manifestations and desires to go home to earth, but some of the crew have become emotionally attached to these human duplicates of their long lost loved ones.  There is conflict while they wonder how much the planet 'knows' about what is happening and if 'it' wants something from them.  The crew must make a decision to stay or go.  Ultimately, the movie is not an action film.  It is very cerebral in nature and is rather slow moving.  If you are looking Star Wars, you will be disappointed, but if you liked iBoy, you might enjoy this.  The pace wasn't the real problem with this flick.  I can handle a slow, thoughtful film.  Therein lies the problem:  it wasn't thoughtful.  There just isn't a point to this film. There were some hints to heaven and perhaps even a hint toward the Son of God (Solaris means 'toward the Sun') for salvation.  But if the ending was 'heaven', I'd say, ""No thanks!  Just too depressing!""  The acting was very good, however.  Too bad the writers couldn't pull together the MEANING of the film.  If it's going to be a slow point, there must be meaning.",1497484800,2,2005,4.591549295774648
1881779,5,B00009ATIX,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but I ended up really liking it. Of course, it's George Clooney so what's not to love?",1497139200,,131,4.076923076923077
1881780,5,B00009ATIX,"If you like Si-fi that is more than something like Buckaroo Banzai and prefer something more like 2001, you may like this film.

This is basically a story about love, redemption and choice in a Sci-Fi wrapper. It is very very heavy on dialog, so my suggestion would be to watch this film with Closed Caption enabled. Once you can hear, see and read the dialog, you will understand the nuances of each character, story and film a better. Things become more clear...

Still, the ending, like many other movies, is left up to the viewer...",1496620800,,536,4.572916666666667

1881782,2,B00009ATIX,"This is a dreadful adaptation of a masterpiece. The movie gets one thing right: Solaris is, in part, a gothic tale in which, in an eerie interior, characters are haunted by ghosts. But it takes the sappiest possible approach to Kelvin's personal story, so whatever the movie gain by its tight focus on his pain, it is lost by it schmaltzy approach. And, in any case, if you have one of the most fascinating ""characters"" in the history of science fiction, the Ocean, you do not ignore it. The Ocean is completely left out of the story, to the point that I wonder whether anyone who is not familiar with the original novel is able to fully understand the story or what is at stake.

For different reasons, do not watch.",1491868800,3,717,4.473282442748092

1881799,2,B00009ATIX,"I'm really not surprised to see so many negative reviews for this wonderful, dreamlike film; it's certainly not for everyone, especially those who prefer their films pre-digested & undemanding. But for those who are willing to give themselves over to its rich, subtle rhythms, an astonishing experience awaits. An extended meditation on love, loss & memory, this film takes the viewer deep into the heart of Being, far below the trivial layers of the Everyday. George Clooney gives a superb & nuanced performance: a modern Everyman struggling with grief & the limitations of his own imagination, he hopes for that precious second chance we all long for so desperately ... and does he find it? Like so many of the questions raised by this film, the answers are yours to determine.
Walt Whitman once said, ""Great poems demand great audiences."" And so it is with this film: passive, spoon-fed viewers need not watch. The filmmaker trusts in the intelligence & depth of soul of those who do watch.

OK, I totally lifted all of that from one of the top positive reviews. Because the film is many of those things. But (spoiler alert) it is not a film where important questions are raised and remain open to uncertainty and shifting answers. This film spoon-feeds us the Disneyland treatment of the afterlife. Right down to gaining entry by grasping the hand of a child. If the filmmaker trusts in the intelligence and depth of soul of the audience, he thinks we want everything to be great with a small blond-haired and blue-eyed boy to help us accept our happy ending. Sorry for the 6-7 billion people who don't equate little blond boys with cherubs, because that's the stereotype you're getting.

The questions raised about identity, about what it means to be a human, what our past means to our present, what death means to the living and the dead are all literally and with intent not answered. As in Clooney's character, who has questions about all of these things, being told at the end ""you don't have to ask those questions anymore. We are here together, and that is what matters."" We will be happy pretty white people in a nice apartment forever and ever.

Essentially, the import of the film is destroyed by its end. Heaven (aka Solaris) is a giant plasma globe colored extraterrestrial thing that wants to give you what you want the most and will put up a vigorous fight against letting you interfere with it making your dreams come true. Your dream might beg to be destroyed with a ""pulled-out the current hot science jargon"" negative Higgs boson beam, and she might get her wish (and that makes. But once you fall into heaven, she's back, and letting you know that she's not concerned with who she is anymore and you shouldn't be either.

At least we're still left with the question from our mandatory quirky spaceman ""I wonder if they can get pregnant?""",1486512000,4,2861,4.738955823293173
1881800,5,B00009ATIX,"George Clooney plays Kelvin, a psychologist in the future who hires on to travel into space to find out what is going on in a corporation mining company on a distant planet that seems to have reverted into a kind of semblance of a thinly held together paranoid detente among the crew, kind of like many workplaces of today. During his trip away from Earth he is haunted by memories of his wife, who is a kind of woman who inspires a man to madness because she forever captivates you yet is impossible to live with. The planet is Solaris and Kevin begins to question his own sanity because Solaris seems to have some kind of symbiotic interaction with human thoughts that blur the distinction between waking dreaming and reality. The great ensemble cast work together to add to the ethos and mood tones in space. Ultimately we observe the character of Kelvin asking himself what is truly important in his life out of all of his memories and if he could choose to live in any world, which world would it be?

There need to be more scifi movies with both this quiet introspection, as well as accurate depictions of the unforgiving vastness of spacetime and its exploration. Not all movies about our steps into the void need to be about war and explosions. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is an obvious example, as well as a recent homage, 'Interstellar'.

George Clooney, a most highly over-rated as an actor, provides a lackluster performance in this drowsy flick.

The entire movie is just the two of them lost in space; drifting and chatting, chatting and remembering, remembering and drifting some more. If there was a point to this movie, it must have been chopped and left for dead on the editing room floor.

The computer graphics and setting are typical sci-fi . The problem with this motion picture is the writing and acting. Clooney didn't seem to want to be there. It is a very long, abysmal offering.  Compare it to Clooney's other space movie, 2013's Gravity. Another sleep-inducer that begs the question: ""Doth Clooney fancy himself the modern Bill Shatner?""

Anxiety in the movie comes from anticipation. The movie leads you to believe that something significant will happen soon, or that something will jump out from a dark corner. Nothing ever does. There is a supernatural mystery in the movie that is not fully explained.

1881907,3,B00009ATIX,"I have seen the original Solaris. It's long and spends lots of time in theoretical discussion or just plain scenery footage. That film is considered a classic. In 2002 Steven Soderbergh directed a remake. It has a much shorter running time and beautiful imagery, however I feel it missed the mark on the most important piece of the original. This new Solaris is an emotional analysis, but in the end that's all it is. A drama set on a science fiction backdrop. It's missing some important details that would have made the movie a worthy modernization of the 1972 Russian predecessor. As it stands it's very pretty to look at, and just okay to watch.

The story evolves around a newly discovered planet named Solaris. NASA launched a space station (the cast keeps calling it a spaceship though) to survey the planet. Some time later a corporate buys the station and uses it as a research lab to investigate any viable resources to exploit from the planet. Then things get weird and psychologist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) has been asked to come aboard to help straighten things out. Kelvin finds the remaining scientists are not alone... and soon after neither is he. A long lost love show up out of nothing and now Kelvin struggles between intellectually knowing she doesn't exist and emotionally conflicted with the opportunity for a second chance. Sounds a bit like a love story, right? In a way it is. That can either be a benefit or detriment (or both at the same time) depending on how you look at it.

The problem for me with this story is it's way too lean for a science fiction drama. The movie really is just about Dr. Kelvin and his emotional roller coaster. Any exposition about what's happening on the station or the planet Solaris has been clipped down next to nothing. What happened before Kelvin shown up? Where are the specifics about the research of the planet? How did they get to the conclusions they came up with? There is a lot the movie hints at, but never follows through with any explanation. Not even a hint hidden in some of the camera work. It feels like you are only watching a portion of the movie and somewhere in the cutting room floor is the rest of it.

So I'm not a big fan of the plot. I will say Solaris looks great visually. The sets onboard the station have just the right amount of clarity, filtering and shadow to make the mood enveloping. The shots of the planet swirling with color and space station standing in contrast are a treat. The occasional long shots reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 are appreciated and give you a good deal of atmosphere to absorb. I'm also guessing George Clooney in tip top shape half naked half the time didn't hurt in the sex appeal department. All in all there is plenty to look at in this film to appreciate (even if aren't into Clooney's butt).

Acting is also a feather in this movie's cap. Clooney hits the mark with the complexity of the character without falling into melodrama. Jeremy Davies plays an off-balance type character in such a way that both endeared me and gave me the creeps. Natascha McElhone brings elegance and depth. Viola Davis make me feel the paranoia in her character. I may have misgivings on how the script was laid out, but I cannot deny the stellar cast. In the end a great looking movie with great actors still gave me an incomplete movie.

I have yet to see this film released on Blu-Ray. However this DVD release has a very impressive transfer. I'm hard pressed to notice much difference between this and an average Blu-Ray transfer when playing the film upscaled. Audio is solid enough as well, but I personally felt the center channel could have been more defined with dialog not quite measuring up in some scenes. The really is only one extra on the disk, and it's the commentary from director Soderbergh and producer James Cameron. It's not bad, and makes me kind of wish Cameron has more say in the film's direction after hearing his comments. Solaris had the potential to really push this story to the next level, but stuck to a basic formula without taking advantage of the setting that was available. This film is strictly for those into romantic dramas, even if you don't like science fiction.",1421366400,,4218,4.626168224299065

1881910,4,B00009ATIX,"Sorry, but I found this version to be far better than Tarkovsky's. The pacing is better. Chris and Rheya's backstory is explored here, which makes us able to care about the characters and better understand the dynamic that leads to Rheya's appearance in the first place and the resolution of their conflict. Ultimately, this film left me with some things to think about and even apply to my life, unlike the '70s version. Tarkovsky's picture is beautiful, but it is literally just a moving picture. Soderbergh's picture is a thought-provoking experience.

Not that there aren't any flaws here... Viola Davis' overacting is one. And you'd think after Clooney has supposedly taken a long journey to another solar system or galaxy, he could arrive with longer hair and a beard before quickly tidying himself up. LOL.",1417910400,,813,5.022222222222222
1881911,4,B00009ATIX,"Spoilers do follow. Awfully sorry.
See, I have this problem when big-name, sex-symbol Hollywood stars try to portray, you know, the rest of us.
Like in the (awful) movie Vanilla Sky...Tom Cruise's character is being pursued erotically by a horny Cameron Diaz, or a woman who looks just like Cameron Diaz. And we're supposed to think this is somehow a bad thing?
Or in Solaris, Rhea (Natascha McElhone) wakes up after being resurrected by Forces We Cannot Understand, and the first thing she sees is Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) in full on hunk mode looking down at her with these loving eyes and his big, weight trained arm held protectively over her body, and the first thing she says is, ""No. No.""
I'm not buying it.
Does it make sense in the context of the film? Sure. But you lose sympathy, don't you. It's like that old satirical headline from The Onion (World's Finest News Source) which reads: ""Bradd Pitt Bored By The Sight Of Jennifer Aniston's Naked Body."" Sex symbols are people that we as a society have the collective hots for. Can't we leave the ordinary people roles for ordinary people.
Clooney and McElhoe do a decent job in this movie, but for my money Jeremy Davies steals the show as the mentally disjointed Snow. I prefer using close captions on movies, and whoever captioned this one did an awesome job. Davies' performance relies on hesitation and stammering and silences, and the captions keep right up with it.
I was on the way to giving this movie a three star rating, but the ending surprised and pleased me enough to raise that up to four. It's one of those movies like Contact where people go deep into the cosmos only to find that the Forces That Rule The Universe are acutely interested in our personal lives...which, let's face it, is the cosmogony most of us are comfortable with. If you want a more nihilistic point of view, may I suggest the Alien series.",1417564800,4,1891,4.647761194029851

1881939,4,B00009ATIX,"I have watched this movie version (director: Soderbergh) twice, read the original novel, and watched the Criterion Collection Russian version. All have very good, but different positive points. That being said, I probably like this version the best of the three. The book has a very strong concept (we can't even begin to imagine what an super intelligent alien entity would be like, how we would communicate with it, what it would want), but I found it somewhat tedious. This assessment goes also for the Russian movie - excellent, but very long, tedious in places, acting somewhat stilted. The Soderbergh version takes a very different path with the same concepts and interprets those concepts through a love story -  somewhat a ""re-imagining"" in a way. Most moviegoers looking for the typical straightforward, action oriented (lasers and spaceship crashes) sci-fi experience will probably not care much for this. The hard core sci-fi fans have criticized it also - sometimes you just have to allow some license with transgalactic space travel and gravity in a space station; I did not think this detracted too much from the film at all. In fact, I thought it was extremely well done technically. Rather than tedious like the Russian movie version or the book, I found this version slow but methodical, with real emotion. I also thought the performances were all top notch and perfect for this version of the film.

1881962,5,B00009ATIX,"Dreamy, poetic version of the story Solaris, which is also a Polish novel from 1961, and a Russian film from 1972 (by the great Tarkovsky). Fans of Tarkovsky might be put off by the fact that someone else remade the film, but if you think of it as a separate interpretation, then you'll enjoy it. There's more ""looseness"" in this version, and influences seem to range from obvious (Tarkovsky, Kubrick) to less obvious (Godard). This version uses more flashbacks, and has a simple but very effective color palette where flashbacks are all warm colors like orange, and the main story is all cold colors like blue. The very first dream/flashback sequence has nearly flawless editing, and could easily be studied in film schools. This is one of my favorite Soderbergh movies (aside from Schizopolis and Gray's Anatomy), and also boasts one of my favorite modern soundtracks (by Cliff Martinez, who years later went on to score the equally dreamy film Drive). A great example of the rare big budget ""art film"".",1404086400,,1005,4.883040935672515

Here, director Soderbergh, uses dialogue, and tence psychology to take us on a journey into both outter space as well as the inner space of our deepes fears and desiers.  To quote a line from the movie, ""we are in a situation that is beyond morality.""

This reboot of the 1968 snoozer is nothing short of a mind-bender that would have made Kubrick proud. Solid performances by top notch talent suck you into a story unlike anything you have ever seen in a film. There is nothing predicable here, and even on multiplal viewings new layers reveal themselfs, which to me is the benchmark of a clasic masterpiece.

1882004,3,B00009ATIX,"It's all right to have sci-fi movies that aren't ""shoot 'em up blast the aliens"" flicks, so the leisurely unrolling of this movie didn't bother me.  What was irksome was the idiotic behavior of George Clooney's character, Kelvin.  He plays a shrink sent to a space station to investigate what a friend of his there said were things he couldn't describe.  The question is: why not?

This is spoiler territory coming up.  Some alien presence, or the planet itself, is replicating people out of the space station's crew's memories.  When the initial call for help went out, why didn't the commander simply present the ""visitor"" he had and say, ""Look, I left this person behind on earth months or trillions of miles ago, and here he is standing right next to me.""  Further, why would these replicants cause insanity in the crew?  Genuine puzzlement and fear, certainly.  But lunacy?

The owner of the space station sent out a security team to the station, which was never heard from again.  Why?  The movie never refers to it again, except once in passing.  Did they die, go crazy and crash into the strange planet below, what?

And the star, Kelvin, who is initially shocked to see his dead wife suddenly beside him there in the middle of nowhere, gradually comes to accept her presence and even to fall in love with her.  Did he fall off his rocker and bang his head on a spaceship tailfin?  He knows his wife is dead, surmises that this creature near him is some sort of alien concoction, and then defends her and wishes to return to earth with her.  Gordon, the physicist and the only person who makes any sense in this movie, is dead set against that, for understandable reasons.

There's an underlying theme of forgiveness and second chances running here.  The creations themselves realize that they're not the originals, and yet they are true copies of the crew's memories.  They're also indestructible, or rather self-healingly immortal, which poses an apparent problem at the end.  But the alien force evidently takes this into consideration and, well, shall we say that love conquers all?  That even an incomprehensible force wishes to aid humans?  I wonder if an eternity with no escape will be as satisfying to the couple in question as the two think it will be.

This is really a two star movie, but I gave it three for its high-value production and for attempting something a little out of the ordinary.  There are elements of Moon and Event Horizon here, but the movie does try to be a different kind of smoke.  Also factored in is the suspicion that my disgust with the reactions of most of the movie's characters might have overshadowed some of its subtleties.",1376524800,2,2673,4.706896551724138

This movie will appeal to those sci-fi fans that aren't adrenaline junkies, and enjoy a bit of the mystical, bordering on the supernatural mixed in with this slow-simmering space station mind bender.

 Also, this film is a unique adaptation of Lem's book and also unique from the previous Tarkovsky film version. It cuts its own path, leveraging the ideas of both, but with a focus on romance delivered with a mystical twist.

I was a bit thrown off at the initial premise, one guy sent to rescue a space station, where I could of thought of a number of better ways to rescue it, but going with the flow of the film, it sucks you in.

If you like high adrenaline with your Sci-fi look elsewhere, but if you like a slow burn mind bender, give this a try.

All performances are top rate, especially that of the strangely beautiful Ms. McElhone who must (and does) convey the circumstances and plight of at least three distinct characters with three very different personalities. Casting all around is impeccable. Storywise--references to a God ""the Creator"" and the immortality of the Human Spirit are so subtle that if you reach for the popcorn you might miss them. Story-telling by intercutting ""real time"" drama with stream-of-consciousness flashback memories and present imaginings is innovative and excellent. Of course, the elephant in the room is Solaris--a planet? a conscious entity? an expression of the subconscious? It's for the viewer to speculate. There is, in fact, a resolution--and it's one heavily weighted with compassion, understanding and an unexpected benevolence. Caution-- this film is mostly for the cerebral (and certainly for fans of Natascha). Apart from a few very convincing special effects, there is nothing really here for Frodo, Luke Skywalker or even Arthur C. Clarke.",1356048000,6,1360,5.543269230769231
1882023,5,B00009ATIX,"A beautiful movie. I loved it from first frame to last. No, it does not really compare to the original, which is more about the strange situation, which is ultimately unresolved. This one is more of a character piece, very emotional. And although I have never been a big fan of George, he is great here. In my opinion, he's better in a dramatic role like this.

At any rate, he plays a psychologist who is asked by a friend to investigate the very strange happenings aboard a spaceship orbiting a planet called ""Solaris."" It appears as though the captain of the vessel has gone mad. Different from the original story, but not substantially so.

Upon arriving, George's character finds the crew either noticeably disturbed (as in the case of the very creepy Jeremy Davies), or just dead, as in the case of the unfortunate captain. One of the crew refuses to allow him to enter her quarters, obviously hiding something, and he finds bloods streaks and trails.

When Clooney's character finally succumbs to sleep, he discovers the reason for their apparent madness -- somehow, in this place, dreams become a kind of reality, and the obsessions of the crew somehow become physical entities. George's character, for example, dreams of his dead fiance, and there she is, apparently alive and well.

The crux of the story involves the nature of these beings. Are they real? duplicates of the originals? ghosts? Or just tricks Solaris is playing in a kind of attempt to communicate? And ultimately, as far as George's character is concerned, does it really matter? He seems to have a second chance at the girl of his dreams. So what will he do with it?

One of the most striking scenes in the movie is when Clooney's character, still rational, abandons the first version of his dreamgirl to the vastness of outer space. Does she really float out there indescribably lonely until death, or only until she is far enough away from Solaris for the mysterious link to be severed? We never find out, but it's a very powerful scene. I loved it.

Meanwhile, Jeremy Davies is at his best, playing the nutbag to perfection. Impossible to not get a little creeped out by his performance.

Overall, I have to say that while the original Solaris was pretty much forgettable,  this newer version is anything but. It understands what works best about the original concept and builds on it -- mostly due to the director, I bet. Anyway, I loved it.

1882029,5,B00009ATIX,"In 2002, fresh from the box office success of Oceans 11 (worldwide gross $450M) Steven Soderbergh was able to cash in some of his directorial chips and get a more personal project made. Taken from a 1961 science fiction novel of the same name by the Polish writer Stanislaw Lem, and bearing some resemblance to the lengthy 1972 version by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, Soderbergh's Solaris was certainly a long way from Brat pack hijinks. Costing $47M to make and miss-marketed as a romance amongst the stars between its charismatic leads, George Clooney and Natascha McElhone, Solaris was at once more and less than it seemed. Despite critical plaudits its uncompromising exploration of existential angst left audiences cold and with a paltry $15M at the box office it soon disappeared from screens.

A synopsis sounds fairly pedestrian and gives little clue to the complexity of subject matter and emotion that unfold; after receiving a mysterious distress call from an old friend on a space station in orbit around the planet Solaris, psychologist Chris Kelvin (Clooney) journeys to Solaris in an attempt to understand what has happened and bring the remaining occupants back to Earth. Arriving there he finds everything in a state of disarray and none of the survivors will tell him what is going on; ""Until it happens to you, there's really no point in discussing it"".

Solaris is a swirling mass of sentient energy and acts as if it were a kind of collective unconscious for the space station's occupants by manifesting their most powerful desires; the person they long for yet fear the most in their dreams appears in their waking lives. For Kelvin this is Rheya, the wife he lost to suicide 7 years previously after he walked out on her, and he awakes to find a recreated version of her based on his memories. The movie plays out their relationship both in the past and the present and gives Kelvin the chance to reassess his life and his feelings for Rheya.

Clooney is masterful in a very challenging role; he plays confusion, fear, guilt, longing, loss and a myriad of other nuanced emotions which go against the grain of his usual performances. In promotional interviews he explained he was exhausted from his first directorial effort ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and the fatigue he felt added to his portrayal of Kelvin, a man broken by grief and regret.

Natascha McElhone as Rheya is compulsively watchable even as her performance sometimes raises questions as to its merit. Early on we see her with the luminous eyes, high cheekbones and sensual charm we have come to expect, yet when she appears later as a figment of Kelvin's memory she is almost as if a child, stripped of her charm, self assurance and guile. I had some doubts about the validity of her performance here and got the feeling she was at times sharing an in-joke with Clooney, but she is never less than interesting.

The ambient score by Cliff Martinez is outstanding, a hypnotic, haunting and deeply moving soundtrack that adds immense depth to the experience, whilst the oceanic Solaris is breathtakingly beautiful and presents a mesmerizing visual metaphor for the unconscious, and your reaction to the movie may well depend on what swirls deep within yours.

The movie touches upon big ticket items like forgiveness, the nature of memory and identity, the creative powers of the mind and the meaning of life itself. If like me your life has been touched by grief and perhaps even guilt and regret then you may find its overriding theme of love, loss and redemption an extraordinarily therapeutic experience. The transcendent final moment makes me cry every time; ""Everything is forgiven. Everything"".

There are many ways to judge movies, and by most criteria Solaris is not a great one; however if we judge a movie by how we react to it, by what it makes us feel and what we take away from it, and whether its themes haunt, inhabit and continue to change us, then to my mind Solaris ranks amongst the best and is one I return to time and time again as I seek to understand the themes of my life.",1348876800,,4098,4.804255319148936

They have made a thorough mess of it, adjusted the plot badly, and altered the ending in a way that doesn't make sense. The performances, however, are fine. The 1972 Tarkovsky version unfolds very slowly (which may make some people crazy) and makes very effective use of a minimal budget, but builds to considerable power. It's a haunting film and thought-provoking, and is far truer to the book.  I had hoped the 2002 Soderbergh version would at least make use of Hollywood's considerable CGI abilities to give a visual rendition of some of the strange formations that the Solaris ocean comes up with, but no such luck.",1343692800,,764,4.7368421052631575

Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) gets an urgent message from his friend in the space station Prometheus that something weird is going on, and begging him to come at once and sort it out. Since Dr. Kelvin is a neuropsychologist, clearly we are talking something mental. The reason his friend gives for not saying more is, ""People are listening.""

So Dr. Kelvin goes, and soon finds out what is happening, if not how or why. Each member of the crew has a ""visitor,"" someone who can't possibly be there, but is. Chris' visitor is his beautiful wife, dead by suicide several years earlier. Then Snow (technician) says his brother was his visitor, the little kid was the son of the guy who originally begged Chris to come help, and Gordon, the fourth member of the team, refuses to say who her visitor is.

It's really a pretty psychedelic story, and I have two questions that seriously bug me here: (1) Who was Gordon's visitor, and why wouldn't she tell Dr. Kelvin? (2) Since it becomes clear that the Solarians are somehow doing this, what were their motives? Are they friends or foes of the humans?",1336780800,,1155,4.651960784313726

But for someone who cannot stand another sci-fi movie dependent upon explosions and war-mongering aliens, with a cheesy romance thrown in for good measure, Solaris is like 2001: A Space Oddyssey is to Independence Day.

I never got around to watching this film until recently. I've heard nothing but good things both about the book and the original film, and many mixed and polarizing opinions about this version. After viewing it, I think a lot of polarization comes from the fact that Solaris does not play to the typical American moviegoer. Without trying to be negative, the average American wants escapist filmmaking where explosions and mind-numbing plots provide emotional release from the high strung life typical in American society. Solaris is the antithesis to that in every way. Solaris requires effort from the viewer, it requires their undivided attention, and it requires them to piece the plot together, make sense of it, and draw conclusions about it. A lot of people would find this intimidating.

The right viewer will see Solaris for what it is; a daring artistic film about humanity, what that means, and the ironies of choice and love. Almost every review of this film will give you plot details so I'm trying instead to explain why this film is so good and why only certain people see that. So very few films evoke the kinds of raw emotion Solaris draws from the viewer, and while the film requires a good deal of imagination, the story has a haunting beauty to it that surpasses the majority of sci-fi flicks ever made.

In short, Solaris is the kind of ""high art"" that is missing from so many modern American films, and it's nice to see something so cerebrally challenging amongst a sea of brain dead films.",1327622400,3,1840,4.834920634920635

I saw this movie several years ago, but remember little about it.  I'm not sure why.  Tired, bored, drunk?  Who knows? I decided to give it another try. The film has great credentials.  Steven Soderberg directs, James Cameron and Jon Landau produce, George Clooney stars.  And it takes large cojones to take on Lem's tome and to remake Tarkovsky's critically acclaimed film.

Soderberg (""Oceans 12 & 13, Che"") begins by chopping off most of the beginning sequence and I say good riddance.  We see glimpses of Chris Kelvin (Clooney) with his patients and he seems somewhat distant and lonely.  His friend Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) calls him from the space station and asks him to come and help close it down due to strange events he can't talk about over the airwaves.  Kelvin asks the government agents why they don't send in a security team.  They reply, they did.  What happened?  They disappeared.  Huh?

So Kelvin goes anyway...and by himself!  Now really, how plausible is that?  Now that's out of the way, Soderberg's vision of the trip itself is beautifully filmed, with great color and impressive CGI.  He spends more time with the beauty of space than with the beauty of Earth. This is a bit of a reversal from Tarkovsky's film.  Once Kelvin arrives he isn't met by anyone and stumbles upon a cold storage locker where his friend lies dead.

Searching the station, he finds 2 crew members.  A hyperactive Snow, played with initial craziness by Jeremy Davies (""Lost"", ""Justified"") and a more solemn Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis).  They talk of ""visitors"" but Kelvin isn't convinced.  At least not until he sleeps.  He dreams of his life with his now dead wife Rheya.  At first we don't know what happened but we can tell Kelvin feels guilty.  When he awakes, Rheya is in bed with him.  Natascha McElhone (""Californication"") brings her British accent and high cheekbones to the role and is very good.

The film of course borrows from Tarkovsky but also ""Blade Runner"", ""THX 1138"" and ""2001"".  It is this last film that I was reminded of most.  Not only because of the theme, but the desolation, the loneliness and the stark but beautiful images.  The acting is solid all the way around and Clooney in particular works hard in one of his best performances.  I should also mention that Cliff Martinez provides a terrific soundtrack.

The movie isn't for everyone.  It is slow.  It focuses primarily on the relationship between Kelvin and Rheya, both in dream visions and the ""visitor"" recreation.  There are many unanswered questions about what's real and what isn't, not only in the film but in the universe which we all live...and die.  Cue the ""Twilight Zone"" music.",1317600000,3,2691,4.796943231441048

1882038,5,B00009ATIX,"Just as effective as the 1972 original, yet for vastly different reasons, Steven Soderbergh's triumphant sci-fi masterpiece is an intellectually stimulating look at loneliness, love and eventual madness.  The film is stunning to look at, with each set piece moving in such stimulating manners; and the film itself has such a ferocious fluidity that completely takes you over.  It is hypnotic in a way, shifting rather effortlessly from present day moments to flashback sequences.  The film, in a more modern sense, is far more visually captivating than the original film (both films are adapted from the novel written by Stanislaw Lem, so it would be inaccurate to say that this 2002 film is a remake of Tarkovsky's '72 masterpiece).  Both films, while constructively different, are marvelous cinematic feats.  I think that, overall, Tarkovsky's film makes the strongest statement (and it remains haunting regardless of how many times I watch it), but that is no discredit to the work that Soderbergh does with this underrated classic.

Why isn't this loved deeply by all?

Chris Kelvin is a psychologist sent to a space station orbiting an alien planet.  That particular station has stopped all communications, and Kelvin is sent to investigate why.  When Kelvin arrives he is quickly absorbed into the manipulated atmosphere created by the glowing orb lingering outside the space station.  Infiltrating his inner desires, this planet projects Kelvin's deceased wife.  Kelvin's rationality initially rejects this reincarnation but with persistence this planet is able to get inside his head, where he wholly accepts this woman as the root of all happiness.

Soderbergh's interpretation of the source material is vastly different than Tarkovsky's.  Apparently, neither director appeased the novel's author, who was vocally opposed to both film adaptations.  Where Tarkovsky projected a coldness that seemed to highlight the story's more intellectual side, Soderbergh plays to the romantic, creating a more warm and embracive texture with the film.  The film is a visual marvel, and Soderbergh uses that element with such finesse.

The performances here are all top notch.  Clooney really sinks into the role, and while his character can at moments feel more observational than anything else (like a mere canvas for those around him to paint), he grounds his performance in a `felt' emotional resistance.  Viola Davis is extraordinary here, finding a solemn depth of character that lives in the small moments.  Jeremy Davies provides small splashes of humor that break up the film's consistent tension, and Natascha McElhone uses more than just her stunning looks to captivate the audience (and Clooney).

I can understand why some are put off by this film; for it is not the most accessible feature film.  Honestly though, this is a stunning piece of work, and it serves as a complimentary piece to Tarkovsky's version because they tell two sides of the same story, or two variations, so that we can get a fuller picture, which in the end may be exactly what Stanislaw Lem would have wished us to see.",1316044800,5,3101,5.199195171026157

George Clooney goes out to a distant space station to find out what is going on with the crew after they send a mysterious message.  It is a puzzle for both Clooney and the viewer to figure out just what is going on, so in some ways it resembles a crime story.  Each of the crew faces their own personal demons as (it seems) some unknown force (or god?) plays mind tricks on them.

Along the way, the mysterious things that happen raise interesting metaphysical questions:  Is a cloned person really a person?  If you kill an exact copy of a person, did you really commit murder?  Is it a gift or a torment for someone close to you in a troubled past to come back from the dead?  (You are confronted with the troubles, but then again, maybe this time you can fix things.)  Imagining yourself in Clooney's position, the situation brings out the deep mysteries of what it means to be alive, what identity means, what morality means.

While this could just make for a depressing movie, in fact by the end there is a kind of acceptance which proved (at least for me) to be spiritually uplifting.  It also helps that the movie is visually beautiful (amazing dynamic and colorful shots of the nearby star, cool renditions of a space station) and that the sound track is sublime and mysterious itself.",1264204800,,1442,4.461832061068702

A memorable quote from the movie captures, I think, the challenge of reviewing ""Solaris"": ""I could tell you what's happening, but I don't know if it would really tell you what's happening.""  Put another way, the issues and messages conveyed in this movie are complex and, some might say, buried.

At its essence, ""Solaris"" addresses the central question of reality -- it examines what is real and what is imagined.  Through the use of dark and powerful cinematography, sound effects, and character portrayals, ""Solaris"" asks the viewer to consider the line between mind and matter.

This movie takes patience and a desire to consider complex topics.  For the viewer with such a demeanor and such interests, this is a fantastic movie.

While no Sci-Fi buff, I have enjoyed many in the long line of such films that began with the experimental French film at the turn of the century (19th to 20th). However, Solaris is a film in which the science fiction aspects are quite irrelevant. They are used only as a backdrop to a man-woman story that could have been put into any setting with slight adjustment. The story itself might have benefited from a supername on the marque; but, through no fault of George Clooney, his presence does not salvage the lackadaisical script and direction. The actress playing his wife, Natascha McElhone, certainly makes one believe she would be missed, the others were simply playing roles with little definition or opportunity for an actor to shine.",1254355200,,897,4.8311688311688314

Here we have people acting completely irrationally.  Sure, you'd expect people under mental and emotional distress to act irrationally, but even Charles Manson would probably be scratching his head watching the characters in this movie.  A lot of the problems with this film could have to do with parts that were edited out, which it's pretty obvious that there was a good amount of material left on the cutting room floor.  I can see why Jim Cameron stepped away from the director's chair.  He probably saw where this was headed early on.

And there are two things that really grate on my nerves.  One of them is Jeremy Davies' method of acting.  The other is obnoxious gum chewers.  In this movie you've got Jeremy Davies obnoxiously chewing gum through pretty much the whole thing.

1882052,4,B00009ATIX,"""Solaris"" is a very good adaptation of the famous Stanislaw Lem novel by the always interesting Steven Soderbergh. The film, while falling into the conventional genre of science fiction, is really more about human interactions and emotions: in other words, it's really a love story. Soderbergh is a very creative man, and I appreciated his approach to the subject matter: technology is ever-present in the film, but is never actually the subject of the film.

George Clooney plays Dr. Chris Kelvin, a psychiatrist who is haunted by the death of Rheya, the one true love of his life. He is sent to a space station circling a planet-like object named Solaris to investigate strange happenings on the station and if possible to rescue the crew. What he finds are the remnants of a crew who are having severe emotional problems, and he soon discovers that the reason is the apparition of relatives and loved ones who are in some cases (like Rheya's) deceased and the accompanying mental and psychological duress these beings put the cast through. It is sometimes difficult to tell what is real and what is not, though subtle cues exist for the acutely aware, most notably the changes of color balance in the film between earth and the station and past and present. The film explores the nature of love and human relationships, and it is important to view Solaris as a character in the film, rather than a planet (it actually isn't a planet, it's a planet-like object with intelligence, as explained by James Cameron): Solaris is the antagonist, in essence. The course of the film skillfully takes the audience through the entire gamut of human emotions, but requires rapt attention to understand what's going on, particularly toward the end of the film.

The cast did a fabulous job in the film: this is definitely the best acting I have ever seen Clooney do, but it is the supporting cast members who were most brilliant. Natascha McElhone as Rheya had the most difficult of the roles in the film requiring enormous emotional changes in exquisitely subtle increments. Jeremy Davies as demented crewman Snow likewise had a challenging role (particularly in the climactic scene) and gave a top-rate performance. The performance that was, to me, the most amazing was Viola Davis as Gordon, a crewmember whose role in the drama is unclear at first, but is revealed layer by emotional layer. Davis is simply amazing, and her performance alone is a more than valid reason for watching the film.

The DVD features many extras including two behind the scenes features which are excellent. The interviews with the actors and crew are very insightful, and Soderbergh in particular is very enlightening. I recommend this film to people who want emotionally intense, cerebral science fiction. It is sometimes slow moving, but always intriguing.",1223942400,10,2829,4.9641350210970465
1882053,5,B00009ATIX,"S. Soderbergh's Solaris can barely be called an adaptation of S. Lem's novel, nor can it accurately be called a remake of the 1972 Russian film. However, when viewed without prejudice it is a fantastic film stylistically, as well as in terms of story and character development.

Soderbergh ignores the technical and scientific aspects of Lem's novel and focuses on the human story instead. From the books limited material on the subject he extrapolates the tumultuous love story at the heart of his film. Unfortunately, that means that 'liquid metal' oceans of the novel are left out as well.

In this film the planet Solaris itself plays second fiddle to Clooney's space-faring psychologist, and the question of the planet's possible sentience is overshadowed by the question of what it actually means to be human. The material is still absorbing and adeptly handled, but this reflects Sodenbergh's philosophies, and not necessarily Lem's.

The film pays homage to Kubrick's 2001 by painstakingly recreating his style (some critics may prefer the term plagiarized) including the pervasive atmospheric soundtrack and long periods of silence. This film will not please Sci-Fi action seekers, nor will it please those looking for a faithful adaptation of Lem's text. I'm a huge fan of the book and Solaris is one of my favorite films, so it is possible to enjoy both in their own right.

The performances were dry and hollow, and all the actors in this film are capable of much better.

Tarkovsky's film has more than just a passing resemblance to ""2001, A Space Odyssey"", and I believe it to be the Soviet equivalent.

1882058,5,B00009ATIX,"Steven Soderbergh's stylish psychological thriller, released November 2002 in the United States by 20th Century Fox , eloquently captures the theme of Stanislaw Lem's 1961 book. Written almost fifty years ago, ""Solaris"" is an intelligent, introspective drama of great depth and imagination that meditates on man's place in the universe and the mystery of God.

Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" is a poem to Lem's prose. Both explore the universe around us and the universe within. Not particularly palatable to North America's multiplex crowd, eager for easily accessed answers, ""Solaris"" will appeal more to those with a more esoteric appreciation for art.

When I saw the 2002 20th Century Fox remake of ""Solaris"" (released on DVD soon after), I was blissfully unaware of its legendary history. I say blissfully because I harbored no pre-conceived notions or expectations and therefore I was struck like a child viewing the Northern Lights for the first time. The stylish, evocative and dream-like imagery flowed to a surrealistic soundtrack by Cliff Martinez like the colors of a Salvadore Dali painting.

It was only later that I discovered that Russian experimental director, Andrei Tarkovsky, had previously filmed ""Solaris"" in 1972 based on Stanislaw Len's masterful 1961 book of the same name. Reprinted by Harcourt, Inc. with a new cover featuring a sensual image from the 2002 film, the original book was translated in 1970 from the French version by Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox for Faber and Faber Ltd.

Written almost fifty years ago, ""Solaris"" is a dark psychological drama. Soderbergh faithfully captures the intellectual yet sensual essense of Lem's book by tempering the language and movements. Featuring a fluid and haunting soundtrack, his film flows like a choregraphed ballet. There is a dream-like quality to the film that is enhanced by creative use of camera angles, unusual lighting, tones and contrast, and sparse language. ""Solaris"" is not an action film (no one gets shot, at least not on stage), yet the tension surges and builds to its irrevocable conclusion from frame to frame like a slow motion Tai Chi form.

In response to his friend's plea, a depressed psychologist with the ironic name of Kris Kelvin (played with quiet depth by George Clooney), sets out on a mission to bring home the disfunctional crew of a research space station orbitting the distant planet, Solaris. Kelvin arrives at the space station, Prometheus, to find his friend, Gibarian, dead (by suicide) and a paranoid and disturbed crew, who are obviously withholding a terrible secret from him. It is not long before he learns the secret first hand: some unknown power (apparently the planet itself) taps into his mind and produces a solid corporeal version of his tortured longing: his beloved wife, Rheya (played sensitively by Natascha McElhone) who'd committed suicide years ago. Faced with a solid reminder, Kelvin yearns to reconcile with his guilt in his wife's death and struggles to understand the alien force manifested in the form of his wife. He learns that the other crew are equally influenced by Solaris and have been grappling, each in their own way, with their ""demons,"" psychologically trapping them there.

Ironically, our hero's epic journey of great distance has only led him back to himself. The alien force defies Kelvin's efforts to understand its motives; whether it is benign, hostile, or even sentient. Kelvin has no common frame of reference to judge and therefore to react. This leaves him with what he thinks he does understand: that Rheya is a product of his own mind, his memories of her, and therefore a mirror of his deepest guilt  but perhaps also an opportunity to redeem himself.

Lem packs each page of his slim 204 page book with a wealth of intellectual introspection. Through first person narrative, he intimately unveils the complicated influence of this arcane force on Kelvin. Lem explains it this way: ""I wanted to create a vision of a human encounter with something that certainly exists, in a mighty manner perhaps, but cannot be reduced to human concepts, ideas or images.""

Such an incomprehensible entity would serve as a giant mirror for our own motives, yearnings and versions of reality. For me the contrast presented by such an arcane alien force emphatically -- but also ironically -- defines what it is to be human. It is only when faced with what we are not that we discover what we are. Later in the book, Kelvin cynically observes: ""Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labrynth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed."" In the film Gibarian sadly proclaims of the Solaris mission: ""We don't want other worlds - we want mirrors.""

Lem's existentialist leaning is provided throughout the book and even alluded to in the name he chose for the space station: Prometheus. In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humankind for which Zeus chained him to a rock and sent an eagle to eat his liver (which grew back daily). It is interesting that Soderbergh chose to send Prometheus to a fiery crash and named Kelvin's dead wife, Rheya, after the Greek goddess, mother of Zeus and all Olympian gods. In a late passage of Lem's book, a devastated and sorrowful Kelvin formulates a personal theory of an imperfect god, ""a god who has created clocks, but not the time they measure . . . a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose  a god who simply is.""

Soderbergh addresses Lem's existential vision with several brief but pivotal scenes. One occurs when Kelvin's dead friend, Gibarian, returns to him in a dream on Prometheus and responds to Kelvin's question, ""What does Solaris want?"" with: ""Why do you think it has to want something?"" Another scene occurs as a flashback to a dinner on Earth, when the real Rheya, prior to her suicide, argues with both Gibarian and her own husband about the existence of an all-knowing purposeful God, which both men argue is a myth made up by humankind: to Kelvin's suggestion that ""the whole idea of God was dreamed up by man,"" Rheya insists that she's ""talking about a higher form of intelligence,"" to which Gibarian cuts in with: ""No, you're talking about a man in a white beard again. You are ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't."" Kelvin fuels it with: ""we're a mathematical probability,"" which prompts Rheya's challenge: ""how do you explain that out of the billions of creatures on this planet we're the only ones conscious of our immortality?"" Neither man has an answer. Gibarian later commits suicide on Solaris rather than deal with the manifestation of his conscience. And I can't help but wonder if the underlying reason for his inability to reconcile with his ""demon"" is because he was unequipped to, given his nihilistic beliefs.

Gibarian also tells Kelvin (and we must remember that all this is Kelvin really saying this to himself through his memory of the character): ""There are no answers, only choices."" It is interesting then that the first pivotal choice in the story is made by the doppelganger Rheya (also a manifestation of Solaris but a mirror of Kelvin's own mind) and it is a choice made out of love: to be annihilated, rather then serve as an instrument of this unknown alien power to study the man she loves.

Some critics have called Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" pretentious, boring and devoid of action and intimacy. I strongly disagree. It is simply that, as with Lem's original story, Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" does not surrender its messages easily. The viewer, as with the reader, must intuitively feel his or her way through the fluid poetry, free to interpret and ponder the questions. This is what I think good art should do. And I feel both the original book and Soderbergh's movie do this with enthralling brilliance.

Where Soderbergh and Lem depart lies more in each artist's personal vision and belief. We are defined by the questions we ask and Lem asks a great deal of questions. Whether the forces that drive our universe are best defined by current science and the mind as random without purpose or as the manifestation of arcane motive more readily known through spirituality and the heart is largely a matter of belief.

Reviewer, Rick Kisonak, asserted that Lem's ""novel is an icy meditation on man's place in the universe and the mystery of God. It poses countless metaphysical questions and makes a point of answering none of them. In Soderbergh's hands, however, `Solaris' becomes a celebration of romantic love, which culminates in the revelation of a caring, forgiving creator. At the end of his book, Lem writes [Kelvin ponders]: `the age-old faith of lovers and poets in the power of love, stronger than death, that finis vitae sed non amoris [life ends but not love] is a lie, useless and not even funny.' The director ignores the author in favor of just such a poet."" Kisonak is referring here to Rheya's interest in Dylan Thomas and its reference throughout the movie. Another reviewer, Dennis Morton, goes so far as to suggest that the screenplay of ""Solaris"" is the first stanza of the poem, which ends with: ""...though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.""

While I agree with some of Kisonak's reasoning, I think he has missed the point of Lem's book. If one continues to read from the passage Kisonak quoted above  as Kris Kelvin transcends from what he ""thinks"" in his intellect to what he feels and ""knows"" in his heart, to accept his (and humanity's) destiny with humble fatalism  we learn that Lem ends his book in much the same way as Soderbergh's movie: life ends but not love. The endings are physically different, in keeping with some radical alterations from the book in the movie's setting (e.g., the original Solaris station is located on the planet and Lem assiduously describes Kelvin's observations and interactions with the alien ocean; whereas Soderbergh's crew virtually never leave orbit and the planet remains aloof in the background, reflecting Soderbergh's focus). Yet, Kris makes the same choice in faith and love in both book and movie (although the choices play out differently).

In matters of faith and love, here is what Kris has to say in the book: ""Must I go on living here then, among the objects we both had touched, in the air she had breathed? . . . In the hope of her return? I hoped for nothing. And yet I lived in expectation . . . I did not know what achievements, what mockery, even what tortures still awaited me. I knew nothing, and I persisted in the faith that the time of cruel miracles was not past."" In the end of both movie and book, Kris Kelvin lets go of his fears and lets his spirit rise in wonder at what astonishing things Solaris (and the universe) will offer next.

In the final analysis, both book and movie are incredibly valuable but for different reasons. Soderbergh paints an impressionistic poem, using Kafkaesque brushstrokes on a simpler canvas, to Lem's complex tapestry of multi-level prose. Lem challenges us far more by refusing to impose his personal views, where Soderbergh lets us glimpse his hopeful vision. I think that both, though, come to the same conclusion about the ethereal, mysterious and eternal nature of love.
On the one hand, love may connect us within a fractal autopoietic network to the infinity of the inner and outer universe, uniting us with God and His purpose in a collaboration of faith. On the other hand, love may empower us to accept our place in a vast unknowable and amoral universe to form an island of hope in a purposeless sea of indifference.

Whether love mends our souls to the fabric of our destiny; enslaves us on an impossible journey of desperate yearning; or seizes us in a strangling embrace of unspeakable terror at what lurks within  surely, then, love IS God, in all its possible manifestations. This is unquestionably the message that unifies book and movie. And it is one worth proclaiming.",1212969600,8,12088,4.908912830558276
1882059,5,B00009ATIX,"Solaris has become stuck in my sub-conscience more than any other movie I have ever seen. When I first saw it in the theatre, I left a little bewildered, not quite sure what to think. I did know on some level though that it would always be with me. I have since seen Solaris many, many times and am still no clearer on what the ""message"" is. I know there are several obvious explanations as discussed in other reviews here, but there is more to it. Something about the experience taps into a basic human truth that we have not begun to realize. Beyond the dialogue and story are the images and sounds. Everything about Solaris is subtle, including the way it works it's way into your mind. I am not trying to sound pretentious. If that were the case I would offer explanations, and I have none. I completely understand why this film gets so many negative reviews. I do however feel sorry for those who can not allow themselves to be hypnotised by this film as I am. The acting is good and the diologue is fine, but that is not the point. The planet and music are the main characters. And let me just say as a former music major in college I feel at least a little bit qualified to say that the soundtrack by Cliff Martinez is an absolute friggin' MASTERPEICE. This is the greatest original score in film history. No other score in any film is so completely integrated into the experience as this one. Solaris would not exist without Cliff Martinez. The only thing I am sure of is that for some reason I feel a great sense of comfort at the end when Rhea says ""we don't have to think like that anymore""",1211760000,6,1601,4.322259136212624

1882061,4,B00009ATIX,"Although this film compares unfavorably to the Tarkovsky version (not much wouldn't), I was pleasantly surprised with Soderbergh's rendition of Lem's novel.

The technical concerns of this film are all but flawless.  The set design is perfect - futuristic but minimalist and believable so as to keep the viewer focused on the plot rather than the flashy effects.  The editing, directing, cinematography, and script are all top-notch, and although Soderbergh chose to tell the tale of Kelvin and Rhea's romance through the rather hackneyed technique of flashbacks, he tied the segments to each character's memories in such a way as make each flashback seamless and keep the plot moving forward.  All of the romantic scenes are well done - intensely emotional and almost never cheesy or overly sentimental.

One of the main things tying everything together in this film is the phenomenal music by Cliff Martinez.  The subtle, synth and string-filled orchestrations are one part Romantic classical music, four parts experimental ambient, and each time Martinez's themes resurface, the viewer is immediately filled with the same sense of yearning experienced by the character of Chris Kelvin.  Unfortunately the CD of this score is out of print, but luckily it is still available on Itunes.  (For another great sci-fi film whose music connects its disparate plot lines, check out Aronofsky's ""The Fountain."")

My small complaints with this version of the film are these:  Although Clooney pulls off his role expertly, I didn't care for the supporting players in this film.  Ulrich Tukur's character is perfectly nuanced and tragic, but Viola Davis is too stiff, McElhone delivers her lines poorly (though she does have an incredible screen presence), and Jeremy Davies attempts to bring some oddball light humor to a film that didn't really need any.  (Am I the only one who is annoyed when a great, serious film is interrupted by some jackass failing to act funny?  Not every film requires comic relief, people.)

In addition to that quibble, the ending, though shot gorgeously, is a bit convoluted, and though it seems to be hinting at the sublime mystery reached at the end of Tarkovsky's original, this film's ending doesn't quite hack it.

It's a shame, though, that Soderbergh's take on Solaris was perceived as a failure simply because it was marketed (and perhaps cast) poorly.  As Soderbergh mentions in some of the DVD extras, it hearkens back to the sci-fi films of the 50's and 60's, which remembered to include real human drama amongst all the glitzy space travel and laser beams.",1209081600,5,2589,5.099526066350711
1882062,4,B00009ATIX,"If you haven't watched the film yet, you probably won't want to read this review. I'm going to get into spoilers and meanings and demystify the ending for you.

Kelvin (played by Clooney) is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist (not really sure, but it doesn't matter) who is sent to a space ship that is docked near a planet named Solaris to determine what has happened to the crew and if the mission can be salvaged or the crew returned home. While onboard the ship, Kelvin flashes back a few years prior to memories of his ex-wife who committed suicide after they had a fight about her having an abortion without telling him. Angry about her having the abortion without telling him, Kelvin tells her he is leaving her, she replies ""I won't make it without you"" to which he responds coldly ""then you won't make it."" She commits suicide. Kelvin returns some hours later to their apartment to find that she has taken her own life.

Kelvin is haunted by this guilt and has never really gotten over the suicide of his wife.

Onboard the space ship Kelvin dreams about his ex-wife and to his surprise she has appeared on the ship. At least someone that looks exactly like her. What has actually happened is that by dreaming about her, Kelvin has manifested a clone of her onto the ship, but the clone has no real emotional connection to the memories that Kelvin has of his ex-wife. The clone keeps attempting suicide because that is how Kelvin remembers her, as suicidal. But since she really isn't alive in the first place, she can't die.

The remaining crew discuss whether to return to Earth or not. At first it appears that Kelvin has been transported back to Earth and resumes his life in his New York apartment but later we learn Kelvin actually chooses to stay on the ship and dream of himself as being back in the New York apartment with his ex-wife. He in essence chooses a fantasy life over a reality life, though this is a concept that the film maker would like you to think about. What is fantasy and what is reality and isn't our perception really more important than ""reality"" anyway.

I liked the film. I've watched it twice now. Vanilla Sky (2001) covers similar ground but that movie was  visually and auditorally stunning whereas Solaris has more of a literary feel to it. Like someone is reading the story to you, and you are looking at some illustrations on a page. That probably appeals to some, and doesn't appeal to others. I feel, however, that the film is responsible for not only putting forth the premise of fantasy v. reality, but also to move that discussion forward with some original insight. But this film doesn't deliver on that. And that to me is where the film falls short.

1882063,4,B00009ATIX,"I really liked George Clooney's remake of Solaris. I saw the original Russian version, which had a lot of 70s Russian cinematic tics (like long, slow, pointless establishing shots and the overdevelopment of extremely minor characters); Clooney's remake is startlingly faithful to the original, which may be why so few people liked it --- the pace was slow, too --- while paring down the truly incomprehensible plot offshoots. If you can free yourself from your Hollywood expectations of how fast stuff should happen on screen, the Solaris remake is very good scifi. Good viewing!",1203984000,,579,5.170212765957447
1882064,4,B00009ATIX,"When I first heard that George Clooney was going to be acting in a serious role, I was understandably wary.  But once I saw him in Solaris, I must admit, I gained a fair amount of respect for his commitment to conveying heavy themes.

The movie itself has been criticized for being too slow and dull, and to a certain degree, the second complaint is legitimate.  If the director had made less use of visual symbolism, it probably would have been slightly less tedius to watch.  However, this criticism is partially mitigated by the excellent story and the truly deep questions that the film asks.  How would you react if you were confronted with a long lost loved one?  What would you do if you had an opportunity to correct a traumatic past mistake?  Solaris asks both of these questions, while doing so in a very unassuming way, forcing the audience members to answer them for themselves.  However, this alone is not what makes Solaris so relevant.

The truly valuable aspect of the film is its investigation of the thought processes associated with obsession, using extraordinary circumstances to illustrate that not all problems have solutions and resultantly, sometimes our greatest adversary can be our personal need to rationalize our unique human experiences.

Solaris is a slow movie, and its ambitious artsiness can become tiresome.  But it has a very valuable message and that alone makes it worth four and a half stars.",1203206400,,1431,4.871900826446281

Kudos to all of the principle actors (Clooney, McElhone, Davis and Davies) for at least 'sticking with the script' and to the set designers as well, but I'll pass on spending more than the rental price for this one.",1202342400,3,602,4.669811320754717
1882066,2,B00009ATIX,"Science fiction film directed by Steven Soderbergh telling the story of astronaut Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) who is sent to explore a mystery involving a space station orbiting a planet that seems to delve into the human psyche.  Although the film has some good cinematography, the plot is tedious and the theme evasive.  The characters are rather bland and not very credible leaving the viewer with a rather empty feeling when the film is over.

The psychological profiles of Clooney's character along with Jeremy Davies' are simply not credible as astronauts who are on a long mission in outer space.  What agency in their right mind would send someone whose wife comitted suicide on such a precarious and solitary mission.  As far as Davies, the character is psychotic and mentally unstable from the start.  Again, what organization would leave such expensive machinery in the hands of a pair of basket cases?  In terms of the story line, the plot clumsily conveys the theme of a psychological struggle for lost love with endless scene reptitions reaching no real climax or suspense.

All in all, the film has some good cinematography but is burdened with a slow unengaging plot carried by excessive repetition of scenes through characters that are rather bland and not very credible leading to a fish-tail ending.  A sleeper at best.  For this type of film, Kubrick's '2001' is a more engaging film.",1201824000,,1406,4.97008547008547

Soderbergh's version highlights different aspects of the novel but remains a lavish and intense and very worthy adaptation.

A psychologist travels to a remote space station -- orbiting a unique planet called Solaris -- in order to investigate the strange behavior of its crew and offer recommendations as to the future of the operation.  What he finds is a planet that works on your mind and memories in strange ways.  In the original novel, the core theme explored through this story seemed to be the impossibility of purely rational detachment and objectivity.  We cannot confront the phenomena of the cosmos without also coming to grips with ourselves and our own demons.

In Tarkovsky's vision the voyage to outer space turns out to be a kind of metaphor for a certain kind of transcendence that turns out to be both false and impossible.  Genuine transcendence, in Tarkovsky's view, is not about detachment and is not (as traditionally conceived) a freeing of the mind from the confines of the body and from the bondage of our emotional life -- but involves the transformation of body, earth and feeling through art.  Soderbergh's version captures elements of both, but also reworks themes from his own work as early as ""Sex, Lies and Videotape.""

When James Cameron announced he was going to remake Tarkovsky's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Solaris/dp/B00006L92F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Solaris</a>, based on the novel of the same name by Stanislaw Lem, I worried that he was going to turn it from a compelling meditation on our desire for transcendence into a B-horror sci-fi pic with high production values.  That had already been done, I thought, and not all that badly, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Event-Horizon/dp/B000E1NXAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Event Horizon</a>&nbsp;(an obvious but uncredited loose adaptation where the demons from the characters' pasts generated by the planet -- in this case a black hole -- turn out to be literally that: demons from Hell).  Luckily, Cameron decided to turn the project over to Stephen Soderbergh.  I got interested again -- and Soderbergh delivered with a gorgeously filmed and very intriguing arthouse science fiction near-masterpiece.  His film is not so much a remake of Tarkovsky's film as a reconsideration of the original novel, that is in some ways more faithful to the novel, but that at the same time takes up themes unique to Tarkovsky's vision and reworks them in ways that fit with Soderbergh's own obsessions: less with the possibility of spiritual transcendence and more with the difficulties of intimacy and trust and of the ways memories and guilt haunt the present.

George Clooney is perfect as Chris Kelvin, played here as a once-confident and cocky man haunted by loss.  Although the film's box office suffered because the film was marketed as an action picture with a flashy George Clooney as star, and then audiences saw a brooding and contemplative film that was as far as possible from the flash of Ocean's Eleven, this is to my mind one of Clooney's best performances and certainly showed what he was capable of before films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Syriana/dp/B000F7CMRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Syriana</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Clayton/dp/B00121QGPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Clayton</a>.  Though Jeremy Davies seems to be stuck in a certain kind of role, he was perfect for this one as a brilliant but neurotic and extremely paranoid scientist, an intriguing alternative to the role played by Anatoli Solonitsyn in Tarkovsky's version.  What I think is most interesting about the film is the way that Soderbergh takes the basic idea and reworks it in ways that involve reconsiderations of the themes from films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sex-lies-and-videotape/dp/0767812158/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sex, lies, and videotape</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schizopolis/dp/B0000BUZKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schizopolis</a>: the ways we create false masks for our lovers to hide our insecurities, that art can work as a kind of false memory, allowing us to reconstruct our past and achieve a false intimacy without risk.  The basic science fiction conceit of Solaris is that the planet is able to replicate memories and especially those one would like to repress because they are unsettling and generate guilt, and bring them back to life, and the varying reactions to these replications suggest different ways of dealing with memories and images and of reconciling ourselves to the failures and guilt in the past.  Soderbergh makes this a story of how one man is able to reconcile himself with his own guilt by collaborating in the creation of and then embracing a lie, a fiction, an artwork.",1199750400,4,5804,6.332065906210393
1882068,5,B00009ATIX,"This is a serious movie, and if you have already decided you don't like it you might consider asking yourself whether there is a deeper reason than the usual considerations.  Facing our mortality, it can be uncomfortable to contemplate immortality. Having found a faith or having confirmed our own lack of faith, perhaps it is uncomfortable to contemplate the alternative to which the Solaris story takes us. And so in that regard this is one of those movies that is a worthwhile experience even if it doesn't give you the most immediate reward, and that's the definition of a great movie.

I loved it. Steven Soderburgh captures the essential mood and mystery of the Solaris story through the changing venues (rainy Seattle, the stark interiors of the space station) all of which heighten the impact of the sentient planet whose mood itself changes in some relationship to the intense interactions of the characters. The sentient planet looks exactly as I, many years in advance, knew it should look and the relationships to that planet of the beings who its manifestations are exquisitely drawn. This is what it might be like to see the face of god.

This is a great movie because it drew me forward to a better place, intellectually and emotionally, and this is not directly dependent on my own religious beliefs or lack of them. The emotional impact is brought to a perfect peak by a poetically beautiful musical score.  See this movie if you are interested in the philosophical implications of your possible origin as manifestation of a more complex and incomprehensible process or in thinking about the nature of life and mortality.",1198022400,3,1638,4.902527075812275
1882069,3,B00009ATIX,"I'm really not sure if I love or hate this film.  It begins with a sort of Alien or Outlands feel to it, i.e. that there  is an unknown force on a space station that is killing and/or causing people to go mad.  The tension builds as the source of the madness is exposed but then the story flatlines.  Love and loss are the primary themes.  Solaris is not an action/adventure movie.  Space is merely the setting for a love story that is something of a cross between Ghost and What Dreams May Come.

Every once in awhile, a work like this simply baffles me.  I don't know whether to recommend it or tell others to avoid it.  I can say that I would never buy and will certainly never watch it a second time, but I got something positive out of it that I cannot quite describe.",1194825600,4,773,4.168918918918919
1882070,5,B00009ATIX,"I can recall seeing Solaris (2002 version) about a year after it came out on home video. The movie appeared interesting and it seemed like a different type of film for George Clooney.  I had no real expectations for the movie, I do remembering I rented this movie several days after I broke up with a girlfriend.  This might have added to my fondness for the film.

Solaris is a very much a film of atmosphere, it is quite, mellow, dark, dreamy, devoted and has flares of intense energy.  It sounds like it might be action pack, yet it really isn't.  As a matter of fact, this movie is rather slow and takes awhile for the plot to reveal itself.  I never found that to be a problem, while other viewers might.  The lush colors painted in outer space and wonderful ambient soundtrack by Cliff Martinez (one of the best pieces of ambient music, I ordered the soundtrack as soon as the movie was over) was paramount in my viewing of this film.  The soundtrack along with the images makes this movie a vision of beautiful tapestry.

It wasn't until after I watch Solaris (2002) that I realized this film was a remake of a Russian film.  I did seek the original and have to say that in juxtaposition, both movies are very different.  The original (also called Solaris made in 1972) is very philosophical and focuses more humankind, where the remake is also philosophical, not as much as the 1972 version, but really focuses on a romance storyline.  I have to be honest I feel many romance centered plots are cheesy and/or insipid.  Nevertheless, I found the romance storyline in Solaris to be absolutely divine.

I also felt this was a strong performance for George Clooney and it seemed like it was a role that he hadn't tackled at that point in his career.  I also felt Natascha McElhnoe was hypnotic in this film.  There were times she appeared malicious and others where she was figurehead of love.  Viola Davis and Jeremy Davies also provide some wonderful acting jobs in this movie.  I give Steven Soderbergh credit, he was brave enough to allow music, atmosphere, editing and set design play a huge part in this movie.  This can be a difficult ruse to pull off and I feel he did a fine job.

There is a fair amount of people who feel that this version is inferior to the original.  Perhaps if I had seen the 1972 version first I might share that opinion.  However, I feel this remake can stand on its own two feet.  I don't think Steven Soderbergh was trying to recreate the original, just add some new texture to it.  It was interesting to see a Russian version and an American version of the same film.  That would be a wonderful social sciences endeavor.  For instance, in the American version all of the actors/actresses are very attractive where in the Russian version they are more ""average"" looking.

Overall for a ""Hollywood-ized"" remake of a classic sci-fi film, I found Solaris to be a great film and a deviation from the standard Hollywood movie i.e. flat characters, tons of CGI, shoddy editing, pointless plot and poor directing.  I can totally understand if Solaris isn't taken in by everyone.  It is slow and is really more of subdued romance disguised as a sci-fi movie.  I can also see how people who love the 1972 version might find this remake as heresy.  Consequently, I enjoyed and own both versions of Solaris and recommend them as wonderful and intelligent pieces of cinema.",1193184000,3,3399,4.587064676616915

Anyway, the fact that many reviewers here dismiss the film up-front because they think it's a remake and not an adaptaion of the book is interesting.

The film itself is of course another shot at Lem's novel. Again, with emphasis put on different aspects than the book (contact with an extremely alien `intelligence'), and different aspects than in Tarkovsky's film (spirituality? god? can't say for sure...).
This one concerns itself with the relationship between character Kelvin and his wife or possibly between Kelvin and his memories of his wife, depends on how to look at it.

The film has a smallish feel to it, a big wholywood spectacle it isn't. Good sense of the future from the presence of many suitable props in the scenery, I'd say 95% of the scenes take place in a confined space, a room, a space station, etc. Strong acting. Bittersweet ending.
It's a psychological drama, not an action fest...

Never understood why they replaced Sartorius(?) with a completely different character (Gordon?)

Too many films seem to want to rush me to some place before I have had a chance to really engage with the visions, sounds, words, music and ideas inside the film. Solaris did give me a bit of breathing space in this respect.

It is a very handsome film and the special effects, although modest in comparison to some recent science fiction films, are effective.

In some respects this film is really a fantasy rather than a science fiction - it deals with a very strange ""what if?"" and this question is not about technology, society or man's relationship with his artefacts and machines. It also looks at some psychological reactions.

I was only disappointed by the fact that we were give so little information about the apparently sentient planet, Solaris. Surely, the people would have gained some information about this strange object?

The quiet, ambient music composed for this film was particularly good and I wholeheartedly recommend the soundtrack. It contains some of the most mysterious and beguiling ambient music I've heard.",1186185600,2,1178,4.7317073170731705

The original Russian film was long, talky and slow-moving - with poor special effects. The original Lem book was also rather wordy. Soderberg explores similar ideas but keeps things moving forward and concise.

1882082,3,B00009ATIX,"Ever sometimes watch a movie where afterwards you feel like you didn't regret but you're there confused as to what you just saw? I had always heard of Solaris but never even bothered to watch it since honestly, I always got the feeling there was something better in the video store. After realizing nothing caught my fancy, I decided to check it out. It's certainly a very stylized and at times striking movie, it's also a case of a movie that's not for everyone. I knew I wasn't expecting some sci-fi shooter like Alien but I didn't expect it to be so serious.

Chris Kelvin is a scientist who gets called to a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Some of the members are dead and the 2 left seem very spaced out and weird. Haunted by the recent death of his wife, he's shocked to find his wife Rheya is up and about. Why is she here and more importantly: is Chris going to reject or embrace this strange re-apperance of his wife.

Solaris, the original, can be seen as a response to Stanley Kubrick's 2001. But whereas that film was more ambigious and has more sci-fi meanings, this is more of a character study than anything. For some, it's a great chance to see George Clooney pull out some acting chops while for others it's just a really slow movie with a whole lot of nothing happening. Some will definately hate it while others will find it underrated and misunderstood. For me, I have no clue what this one is.

It's a weird state of affairs when the commentary is even more enjoyable than the film itself. Done by director Steven Sodenbergh and fellow director James Cameron, the 2 discuss the film and how the film might've been different if Cameron did it. It's always a weird geek moment when 2 directors chat but you wish it was on a more better movie. And of course we get the ever standard EPK making-of stuff. Even if you rent the movie, at least watch the commentary too.

Is it a recommendable movie? I have no clue. Most critics use the love it-or-hate it thing to suggest that those who do take a chance will be surprised and treated to a good movie. I'm just going to leave it with a ""rent at your own risk"".",1171497600,4,2136,4.386363636363637
1882083,3,B00009ATIX,"This dumming down of Tarkovsky's original,'Solaris' is a peculiar form of hommage. I doubt I'd rate it any higher even if its predecessor didn't exist. If this effort earns a 3, Tarkovsky's would be off the map: literally circumnavigating the earth. Tarkovsky is on record about not being happy with his film and the difficulties he had working with the actors. But they are far more subtle, internalised performances than we have here with the Sondabergh. Neither film pays overdue attention to the details of Lem's novel. That's not an issue with film anyway. But if you've seen Tarkovsky's work, for all its tedious arguments and sense of timelessness, you are beholding something you will never forget. If ever one of his films exemplified the title of his collected writings,'Sculpting With Time', it's this one. It is majestic. Not in a panoramic sense but in the psychological: teasing out Lem's themes of love and projection. We simply don't get a grip from the lead actors, even Clooney, of forces worming out of their own consciences. That's partly the star system working against itself. Clooney is, well, Clooney; another day at the office. And you can't forget it. His 'ex' has seductive star glamour, but the voice is frigid. The script spells things out in bold type and there is little room for our participatory involement. Kiddies, if you missed the point, Welsh bard, Dylan Thomas's, Death Hath No Dominion' will help legibility. The original is a cathartic experience!

1882085,4,B00009ATIX,"To begin with, this movie is not a dramatization of the original novel by Stainslaw Lem, yet it follows the premise quite closely. Dr. Kelvin is a shrink still suffering from depression resulting from his wife's suicide (though this is revealed a bit later) when he is hastily sent packing to a space station orbiting a planet named Solaris on the request of one of the researchers on board the station, who happens to be a personal friend of Dr. Kelvin. However, upon reaching there, he is confronted by a manifestation, heck a malediction of sorts, of his late wife. After his initial refusal to accept her, he embraces what he perceives to be a second chance at a lost love, a second attempt, a ""do over"" of sorts. However, all is not well. Inspite of his attachment to his late wife's fascimile, he must acknowledge that she is not real and while he and the fellow inhabitants of the space station prepare for a journey back to earth, they must sanitize against any of the manifestations conjoured up by Solaris which appears to be one single massive life form, or maybe a massive colony of teaming lifeforms able to exert a collective influence.

Soderbergh put in a good deal of effort into preparing this movie, and the fact that the characters use a gamma generator to creating a disrupting higgs field to dismantle the sub atomic bonding holding together the atoms in the physically tangible manifestations (yep not just imagined as in the Stainslaw Lem creationg, these manifestations are as real as your own flesh and blood), is rather impressive.

The end however is rather disappointing. I think Soderbergh was compelled to end the movie on a ""happy note"" or rather give it a fairy tale ending to provide a cushion on which the audience might land. Thus the 4 star rating. There is some heresy about some additional footage running into almost a good 30 minutes more which might eventually be released, though that remains to be seen.

I was quite surprised that so many people seemed to like this film. I am not one of the people who need spectacular actions or speed in Sci-fi films. I loved the Tarkovsky Solaris which was even slower and more difficult to understand than this, but I wasn't bored a bit.(Though I did fall asleep at one or two places when I saw it the first time. But I liked what I remembered and it was like a intriguing and complicated dream with parts missing that you wish to fill in. So I saw it many times. It was magical.) Since I liked Tarkovsky version so much I was prepared for being disappointed by a new interpretation anyway. But the fall was greater than I expected. Especially the ending.

Kelvin seemed to have died and was re-born as a persona of Solaris sea. (His cut healed instantly.) And then his wife(also a Solaris persona and by the way is not really his wife but part of Kelvin's subconscious guilt) returns and says ""Everything we did is forgiven."" What?! ""Forgiven? "" ??? (By whom? Himself? Solaris? )Now they are both parts of the great sea-like- life- form ""Solaris""  but in fact they ARE also both parts of Kelvin's own mind. Then isn't all this  ""playing with itself"" in a very closed world? To me it seemed a very shallow thing for such a great existence to say to itself.

I felt that this film did not make me think deep enough about the meaning of human existence like Tarkovsky's film. It's obviously not light entertainment either so it's just a shallow halfway job not really worth seeing.

It surprised me because I rarely get that engrossed in a love story. What was happening between them stirred the same emotion as the end of Romeo and Juliet. You watch those final scenes helpless to do anything but with a glimmer of hope that everything will be allright (although you know it isn't).

Remaking a Tarkovsky film?!?!?!?  Absolutely sacrelige.  Next, they will be ""reimagining"" the Sistine Chapel.  I saw about half of this film, and I had to shut it off to prevent myself from doing bodily harm to myself and the TV.  How many times did the sod (a British slur term in which I will refer to Soderbergh as for the rest of this review) watch 2001 and Solaris before making this?  The cover box on the DVD is a blatant ripoff of the famous picture/poster of Dave Bowman in his spacesuit with the blinking lights on it.  There are shots that look just like HAL 9000's eye in 2001 (except the eye is bigger.  Wow, what an amazing idea, Sod!  Make it bigger!).  The dialogue is on the level on a high school drama.  Clooney (who is a good actor) is too straightforward and is not haunted enough.  He just looks old here, not necessarily sad, which is the way he should look.  Nastasha McElhone reads her lines without any emotion at all.  The rest of the crew (especially Jeremy Davies turn as the ""stoned"" guy) are a bad joke.  In Tarkovsky's original film, every member of the cast had dignity, and the film was really profound and mysterious, a true epic sci-fi film worthy of comparisons to 2001.  Here, it's dumbed down.  It takes the guise of an ""important"" film, but it isn't.  It's just a remake, and a bad one at that.  Sod has a rep for being an artistic filmmaker, but a lot of his films are remakes of much better foreign films (Traffic is a remake of a far superior British miniseries, for example).  He is very overrated.  He said this was his most ambitious film.  Ambition doesn't mean copying Kubrick and Tarkovsky, sod.  Avoid this.  Stanislaw Lem, the author of the original novel, didn't like either version, but he acknowledged that Tarkovsky had a vision at least.  He said the sod was a hack, and he's right.

Others have written icebergs worth of ink on the content of Solaris, so I'll only say that in each of the times I've seen this film over the last half-decade, I have become more fond of it and more impressed. In a medium where loud sound effects are the norm---all the better to reach a population desensitized by an inundation of noise---Solaris approaches through its gripping stillness, and in this quietude it launches one of the more psychologically-perplexing stories in modern science fiction.

Who among us has not looked into deep space and been caught up in its mysteries? Who among us has not lost someone we love? And who has not wished for those who have left us to return? Those are the elements of Solaris, a film unique in American cinema.",1164326400,5,1062,4.554973821989528

It started OK and had me quite interested as things got setup...but then it really started to drag and didn't resolve itself whatsoever.  This is what kiled it. Its not enough for a movie to simply ask provacative questions, the film has to present a potential ""angle"" on that question or even an intelligent opinion to actually have meaning. This movie just plodded along, it wasn't boring but it didn't really create much tension or spark any ""what if's"" either.

Clooney was OK in this movie but his imaginary wife was rather uninspiring and seemed to be on cruise control the whole movie. The rest of the cast was strange and didn't seem to fit all that well.  Overall, this was borderline watchable but I wouldnt see it again.

I found the story very intriguing and atmospheric and it held my interest - at the same time I felt something was missing and it just wasn't as rich, complex and good as it should have been.

I am not sure why, I think the key for me is that I was not able to really get emotionally involved with the love story - and this is first and foremost a love story. I have trouble with most love stories, due to my own particular biases, so there has to be a lot there to really identify with it. I think the problem here was the casting and acting - it could have been a lot better. The woman playing Gordon was rather flat as well.

1882107,3,B00009ATIX,"If you haven't seen the original Solaris then I suggest you do before you buy this, then you'll be able to judge a masterpiece against this act of mimicry. It's woefully let down by the supporting cast all of whom would find it difficult to get parts in a school play. Natascha McElhone plays our hero's dead wife - I guess the producers wanted a striking beauty in keeping with the original film, but she has no emotional depth. Upon realising that she is a clone she exclaims: ""Oh, my God!"" as if she's just discovered a run in her nylons. She has neither the haunting beauty nor emotional intensity of Natalya Bondarchuk (compare the scene where a little too much liquid nitrogen is taken. In the original film, it's one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history - in this it's nothing). There are two jokers in the pack, I'm sure some bright spark suggested that one of the characters do something with his hands and so we have a third-rate actor wiggling his fingers about as though he's high on butane: how did this idiot get to be a scientist on a space station? On the positive side, we have George Clooney - the one actor who makes you forget about comparisons with the original.

The director's heart is in the right place - it's far from the juvenile ""shoot `em up"" Hollywood sci-fi, although one of the characters (the glum and sexless one) says in a familiar refrain, ""kill it, it's not human!"" If you want to spend time with a good-looking movie buy this, but if you're after something a little more substantial - something you'll be thinking about long after viewing, get Tarkovsky's original.",1148947200,4,1613,4.562068965517241
1882108,5,B00009ATIX,"Most science fiction movies fall into two rough categories: ""Star Wars""-style action films, and more cerebral movies in the vein of ""2001: a space odyssey.""  (Of course, the classification is simplified; a movie like ""Minority Report"" can bridge the gap between the two sub-genres).  ""Solaris"" belongs firmly in the ""2001"" school of sci-fi, which may explain why I liked it - and why it failed at the box office.

Cerebral science fiction movies demand patience and active involvement and almost always disappoint the masses.  (Recent examples include ""Gattaca"" and ""AI: Artificial Intelligence,"" films I admired that achieved something less than blockbuster status).  Such is the case with Steven Soderbergh's ""Solaris,"" which extends a concept that might have driven the plot of a Star Trek episode to feature-film length. That ""Solaris"" feels longer than its 99-minute running time is not necessarily a bad thing.  It's a philosophical movie that eschews action, effects and violence, and is content to linger on moments and details as it considers its trenchant themes.

I can't say too much without giving anything away.  The setup is that Dr. Kelvin (played by Soderbergh favorite George Clooney) is summoned to a space station where some sort of disaster has occurred.  (Imagine how ""2001"" might have played out if Heywood Floyd's Clavius Base cover story had been true, and you'll get the idea). Shortly after arriving on the Solaris base, Clooney meets the survivors, and soon understands why they don't want to leave.

Soderbergh's directs efficiently, and the performances by Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies, and Ulrich Tukur all resonate.  Soderbergh wisely uses special effects to serve the story, based on Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel of the same name.  (I haven't seen the 1972 Russian film also based on Lem's novel, but this version inspires me to seek it out).

""Solaris"" asks us to consider many questions: What would we do if given a chance to relive the past?  How important is memory to our concepts of our loved ones?  Would we choose a false happiness over the ups and downs of reality? ""Solaris"" uses a futuristic setting to explore these questions eloquently and profoundly, leaving the viewer to supply the answers.

Is that good or bad?  Often, it's better not to be familiar with the original creation.  This particular interpretation should have never been released to mainstream audiences.  The masses were never going to be pleased.  Solaris is a ""fine arts"" production.  George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Steven Soderbergh, and the other major artists were essentially committing themselves, whether they knew it or not, to a work of love.  Who am I?  Is there a God? Do our lives make any sense?  What does it mean to have a soul?  Can a copy of a person be almost as good as the real one?  Are the dead able to be brought back to life in some way?  These existential questions underpin the story. George Clooney effectively portrays a man who is reacquainted with his dead wife (McElhone).  Is it really her---or is this a monstrous joke inflicted on him by unseen forces?  This film is slow, but try paying attention.  The investment is likely to pay off.  I will almost certainly be haunted by Solaris for a long time into the future.

It is not the easiest film to watch, as it has very little sound and no action scenes. It generally takes about three watches to actually follow the concept of the film and you probably still won't be sure what it said. The plot centres around philosophical questions about loss and reality. It is an unusual look into grief, what we choose to remember, what we should remember and what we really are missing and want back.

George Clooney has reliably delivered good films in recent years and this one though not a box office smash like Ocean's Eleven is right up there with his best. It is set on a space station revolving around a planet named Solaris where the main character is called to check unusual phenomenon. The story is told through the circumstances on the space station paralleling with his memories of earth. It is an intreiging philosophical film, which is very insightful and will leave you with lots of questions.

1882114,5,B00009ATIX,"Solaris is proof, like Gattaca, that science fiction movies do not need an overabundance of flashy special effects and futuristic gadgets to be science fiction.

Solaris does more with less. Much shorter than the Russian filmed version, both based on the Stanislaw Lew movel, Solaris is a overlooked gem of a movie that ruthlessly explores the problem that arises. The solution at the end is the only one possible, a transcendental one, but I can't see how any other works for this movie.

I expressed a theory to a co-worker that George Clooney movies where he *doesn't* play the ""rogue with a heart of gold"" character he is famous for (Out of Sight, Three Kings, O Brother, The Billy Ocean movies, etc) don't seem to do well at the box office, no matter how well the movies are made. Solaris, which only took in $15 million at the US Box office in 2002 (after costing 4 times that to make) seems to fit this mold.

Besides the wonderful acting from Clooney, McElhrone, Davis and Davies, the soundtrack also makes this movie a complete experience. I wish I had picked up the soundtrack the day I saw this in theaters, it is now out of print and expensive to obtain.

And what would *you* do if someone you lost came back to you, someone who was torn away from you?

I know there are those who prefer the Russian version of the film, but, honestly, I find that one slow and tedious. The Soderbergh version is short, tight and spare.

Solaris is one of my favorite movies and I commend the movie to anyone.",1139270400,14,1505,4.4945054945054945
1882115,5,B00009ATIX,"Perception meets reality as a man comes face to face, not with his dead ex lover, but his memories of her, which are not as complete as he would like them. A nebula like planet dubbed Solaris does this to everyone in its proximity, driving many of them to suicide or insanity. Many of the reveals past this basic explanation are spoilers, which I don't want to get into here.

Top to bottom, one of the better movies of the last ten years or so, Solaris features top shelf acting, cinematography, directing, and a glue-like sound scheme that solidifies the focus of this ""sci-fi"" film set in the near future. To be frank, Solaris could be set in modern day at one of the 94 million Starbucks locations in America, and the message would be the same. The setting is merely a distant backdrop for a story that intentionally asks more questions than it answers. As it explains itself, the issues it deals with are simply too much to answer, the key is to stop looking for them and realize that frustration, uncertainty and pain are just as much a part of life as pleasure, closure and love. At issue among other things, are whether not we can be betrayed by our memories. Yes we can, at least in this film where they take physical form. and remove the ability for the protagonist to shelter himself from the truth. The ""Villain here"" is psychological, taking away the one form of security everyone on earth uses to preserve their sanity. He takes away their ability to lie to themselves. Definitely a universal theme, who of us isn't victim of nostalgia at some point? As a result, with the enemies of each space station crew member being a ghost from their past, the un killable character element here actually has quite a bit of weight to it. After all, the enemies are memories at first, then, doubt and confusion. This movie accurately posits that emotions have much more power than physical demons, or psychologists all around the world would be looking for new clients after each session.

In his best performance to date , George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin, a man who has lost his girlfriend Raya to tragic circumstances and can't seem to recuperate. In the 15 minutes used to set up the relationship these two shared, there is more depth and connection created by director Steve Sorderbergh than the entirety of most Romantic movies. IT also carries much more weight and realistic humor, matching two characters with equal intellect for their conversations. Natascha McElhone matches Clooney both in the very realistic state of flashbacks, and oddly, the dreamlike state of present day action most of the story takes place in. Patient and deliberate, but never boring, the pacing here is perfect for the material and characters. There is no room for a large ensemble cast in a story about intimacy, thus the isolation of the space station serves well to justify the low cast population. When his friend and fellow scientist Gibarean asks Kelvin to join him on the space station to try and understand the large number of deaths, Kelvin understandably accepts. His lack of attachment to anything since he Lost Raya leaves him no reason not to, especially if it offers a chance at reuniting with an old friend.

Sorderbergh here, not surprisingly, excels at a movie that despite its large scope seems to be more in tune with his skills, character development and well framed dialogue. Set up shots are not always the wide angle sort as would usually be approached in sci-fi movies, but often left to more grounding ones like rainfall and other more relatable sights. Any alien feel inherent in many genre movies is dissolved. What few supporting characters are present are allowed room to breathe and create their own identities. Even more impressive is the believability with which all of their dialogue is delivered. It may be a sign of decaying movie talent, but the consistency of ""voice"" is flawless even in the midst of discussing pretty high end concepts, from abortion to depression to God itself. It's a relief, and as a result, none of it feels condescending, if anything we feel for characters so intellectual and likeable who are unable to get past major hurdles in their shared and separate lives.

Sound design carries the mood of this movie, almost as much as the direction and great set design. Dialogue carries shots into each other, music is always appropriate, and the moments of real intensity are balanced perfectly.

1882116,3,B00009ATIX,"First off I'm a huge Lem fan and Solaris is the one book I had read four times and will probably read again. I wasn't all too convinced by Tarkovskis adaption which is a great piece of cinematic art but doesn't deliver what the book was about in its core. Lem wasn't happy with the movie neither. This new adaption he accepted more easily, but not wholeheartly.

To me, there's one specific thing about Lem's work that was not present in Soderbergh's adaption. Sure, one thing is a book, the other is a movie, there shouldn't be much of a comparison, but I was SO let down by the fact that everything else was taken into the movie but NOT the main theme, which was the question of communications, be it with human or alien beings.

In Solaris, people are trying to solve one huge problem. They found this planet that is moving between two suns which is not a seldom thing. But this one isn't behaving correctly: it should only be a matter of time untill the planet gets blown away by one of the suns due to gravitation rules. This one is different. The problem is that this planet might mean that one of the most important physical laws could turn out to be wrong, absolutly wrong. It would be like finding evidence nowadays that our planet in fact IS flat. This would trigger so many questions, it would turn it all upside down. Countless universities are trying to find out if science had been COMPLETLY WRONG, students are doing studies on the subject. So that is the reason why astronauts were sent up there to begin with. In the movie, they are doing ""energy research"". Is this a detail? Hell no it ain't.

In the book, the scientists have absolutly no explanation on anything, they have been doing experiments during the last fifty years or so but they could not repeat one single experiment and get the same result. Whatever they did, the ocean planet SOLARIS never ever behaved in a way that could even give an idea of what this planet is all about. Now the story begins with the arrival of Kelvin. His mission is not only to look after the astronauts but also to make one huge decision: should the whole Solaris project be stopped due to huge costs and no useful results or should they go on and keep looking for clues? It is in Kelvins hands to make this decision. And this also is an important point of the story. Science had never found an explanation, they could only file the side effects of the planet. All they could do was watch and be dazzled, but there was no way to influence or trigger something willingly. Sometimes the ocean did not react on an experiment, sometimes it did, but never twice the same way. And while they are looking for explanations they get these visitors who don't know themselves what it all is about. They even quesionize why they hadn't questionized their being there... on a space station light years away from home. Even the visitors do not have an explanation. They can only watch, and if their host is leaving their field of view they freak out. So they HAVE to see their hosts. In the end the scientists are the ones being researched and observed. For what reason they don't know.

Lem mostly is giving you a special Sci-Fi scenario in which something ALWAYS become clear: these are humans. But Solaris is a place where there is not one single human motive. It is not a place for humans, it has nothing human to it, it goes beyond any possible human explanation, just like a cat would never understand that art and movies exist. Nevertheless, humans are using their human brain to solve a totally un-human thing by asking human questions. Science means asking questions. But every question has the answer already, be it fully or partly. If you are researching the biohazard level of some specific water the result will be restricted due to your restricted thinking pattern. If humans wouldn't have found out that biohazard exists they would have been looking for a totally different thing and found a satisfying answer whatsoever. Lem always successfully shows that in science there are human thinkers, no gods. The problem human people have between each other is absolutly the same the scientists have with Solaris, and therefore that science has, fundamentally. In the book, there are people interacting with each other and the planet. In both cases the communication fails for exactly the same reason, although one is an alien ocean planet, the other is a human.

So in Lem's work one point was to show the impossibility NOT to communicate. There cannot be NO Communication but missunderstood communications due to lack of the possibility to fully identify with and understand the other.

This film is not a good adaption. But it's an interesting love story taking place in space. It's just not Solaris and that is not so bad. If only Soderbergh wouldn't be this convinced by having adapted the original material. Looks like he didn't understand the book by no chance.",1138147200,5,4920,4.636467889908257
1882132,5,B00009ATIX,"For some strange reason this movie resonates well with me, I've been inclined to watch it several times. Fundamentally its a tragic love story with a happy ending. The special effects are fantastic, especially Solaris itself and certain pieces of the soundtrack shouldn't be missed in this life. In order to appreciate the deeper aspects this movie, you need to be well versed in Zen buddhism, quantum physics, comparative religion, psychology and appreciate art, poetry, and science fiction in general. Although, overall it can be a little heavy but better than the original ponderous Russian version.",1137456000,3,602,5.28125
1882133,5,B00009ATIX,"WARNING:  Solaris has a double twist/surprise element in it which definitely adds to the impact of the story.  This review doesn't give them away but others do.  If you don't know the story and want to watch this movie, you really shouldn't read some of the other reviews.  I strongly encourage any future reviewers to not give away any of the surprise elements!

  I specifically looked up ""Solaris"" here on amazon to give it five stars because it's my favorite sci-fi film of all time.  I was staggered to find out it's a remake of a 1972 russian film of a polish book.  I'm definitely going to watch and read those.

  It's perverse to call this a sci-fi film though, since it merely uses science as a means to an end which could have been achieved in any other suitably fantastic way.  I think in our day though it's especially appropriate to use science as that means.

  I'm really not surprised at how extreme the reviews have been... some demanding 0 stars, others 5.  Criticisms include that it's slow or boring, and that it's emotionally inert or emotionless.  I think rather that this is a mood deliberately set to reflect the depression of the protagonist... he chooses to not feel because otherwise he would only feel pain.  His life is dull and hard after having been filled with a bright light of hope and love.  He moves slowly and deliberately in it with controlled motion... almost like a robot?  He's a bastion of strength, but he's hollow on the inside.  He's narcotized himself... he sleeps.

  And then he awakens, metaphorically and literally, and the whole movie takes a radical new direction.  As soon as I saw what he did on his first awakening I was blown away.  Was that courage?  Was it fear?  Whatever it was, it was the first time he had reacted instead of just acted in years!  I don't know but something seemed so horribly right about it and it grabbed me!

  The film is set on a space research station with only three living occupants... sort of.  It's dark, it's cold, it's metal, it's austere, it's floating alone in space orbiting a strange celestial phenomenon.  As a counterpoint to this, much of the film is told via flashbacks of Clooney's intimate, often very warm memories.  Also, almost every scene is filled with human bodies, especially human faces... of all objects, the one that most impresses itself on our memory.

  The theme of (in)completeness and of what makes us complete is central to the film.  So too are the notions of dream and reality, and the question of which we are.  Also, the issues of the nature of representation/represented and the pervasiveness of the mental.  I fashion myself a panpsychist so I loved this.  Finally there's the issue of how to control is to destroy.  The whole film can be read as a battle between two basic urges... the one to control, guard against, or destroy; the other to surrendur, understand, and love.  Each urge is manifest in each character.  In the scientist the former is dominant (science as understanding but only via or for the sake of control?).  In Clooney, the latter is dominant.  In the pilot, the urges are mutually-annihilating, resulting in apathy.  I won't spoil it by telling you which urge wins.  (They both do in their way!)

  As you may have gathered from this and other reviews, this is an unabashedly ""philosophical"" film... there's so much ground covered by it in so many ways so fast, with so much left unsaid or only hinted at that it's hard to take in at first.  When I finished watching Solaris for the first time I was just kind of quiet.  I didn't know how to characterize what I had seen.  I knew it was basically good but not much more.  But so many of the images and scenes and themes kept coming to me in the following weeks and months... I started thinking of how the film was doing or saying something that I had never realized before... that I eventually came to think it was really quite extraordinary.  Later viewings only reinforced this opinion.

  You may end up completely uninterested in it.  Then again you may find that you have the capacity to really enjoy this film and find that you want to buy it to watch over and over again!  Either way, give it a try.

1882134,1,B00009ATIX,"This is the formula that was used to create this movie.

Start with Tarkovsky's 1972 version of Lem's novel and do the following

1) Strip it of all its mystery, creepiness, and hazy imagery, replacing that with Hollywood-style psychobabble and expensive sets.

2) Cast George Clooney in a role far beyond the scope of his acting abilities (thanks for the shot of his muscular ass, by the way).

3) Remove the seldom-seen and seldom-heard basketcase crew members that haunted and confused Kelvin in the book and original movie, and replace a) the pilot with a slacker moron who behaves like a David Spade character and replace b) the mad physics genius with (of course) a black woman actress.  A little bit for the PC crowd and a little bit for the teenagers to laugh at.

4) Lots of flashbacks of George Clooney dressed smartly in his pseudo-James Bond milieu.

1882135,4,B00009ATIX,"Philosophical science fiction about a psychologist sent to rescue a corporation's research station lost in orbit of a mysterious planet named Solaris.  A security team previously dispatched has disappeared and the station's captain has requested Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) to help investigate strange events that have overcome the crew.  Dr. Kelvin arrives to find only two of the five crew members alive and in various states of paranoia.  They are unable to describe what is happening until Dr. Kelvin's wife -- dead for three years -- reappears at the station.  Dr. Kelvin is torn between his professional objectivity and love for his wife to resolve the situation.

Solaris is a very thought-provoking feature that questions conventional thinking and beliefs about human existence.  The reappearance of Dr. Kelvin's wife -- Rheya (Natascha McElhone) -- is obviously due to the mysterious powers of Solaris, but Dr. Kelvin and the crew are unable to determine if she, and others who've appeared, are facsimiles or resurrections.  Rheya is disturbingly of flesh and blood; herself wondering what is happening.  The story keeps viewers guessing until the very end on what Dr. Kelvin will do, and even then leaves open questions on what happened.

This is science fiction of earlier genre that is more philosophical than action adventure.  While the story's tempo moves slowly, it's an intriguing piece that breaks the bounds of conventional wisdom.

Seems everyone on the station has been going bonkers.  When he gets there he finds that for everyone there, the planet reaches into their memories and brings someone to them that they have an unresolved issue with.  His wife comes back to him.  But here is the trick: his wife is constructed from his memories about her, and that is the cool thing about the whole film.  See, when we meet people, especially when we have relationships with them, we think about them and remember them in ways that are not actually correct with who they are.  So since his wife acted a little wierd, he remembers her as a 'crazy person' and never really got to know her.  His 'new' version of his wife is incomplete in her head; she is only his idea of her, which is as a sad, incomplete person.  In flashbacks the movie shows that he has missed the idea on her; she actually was quite stronger than him at times.  But of course their relationship could not go on because he NEVER really got to know who she was (as he says in the film, in a beautiful line, ""I was haunted by the idea that I had remembered her wrong."").

Then, one of the crew calls back to Earth, asking for the one person that may be able to solve the problem: Chris Kelvin, a clinical psychologist. If anything, he gets more deeply wrapped up in the problem than any of the original crew. In the end -- well, I'm not quite sure what.

This movie is very well put together, with good visuals and good performances portraying some people who've become very strange. It's not an action movie - not by any stretch of the term's meaning. It's moody, brooding, and claustrophobic. It may also be George Clooney's ""ego movie,"" the one that never would have been made except that Clooney had made his pile of money and his box office reputation, and use those to push it through. Somehow, it comes across as a big-budget movie with an indy feel.

Not everyone will like this. I do. It has a great look, a very different pace than the usual, and a surreal sense that seems true to Lem's writing, even if the story isn't quite the same.

Solaris is an emotionally deep, stunningly beautiful movie. My husband and I couldn't turn it off although we had other plans...we watched it straight through. The lighting, music and editing contribute to the effect...the pacing builds steadily, fraught with tension. I have been haunted by the images and feelings from Solaris.

Now I want to see the original movie too!",1127260800,6,610,5.09
1882142,4,B00009ATIX,"I have yet to view Tarkovsky's original Russian film of this title, nor have I read Lem's novel, so this brief review is judging Soderbergh's film on its own merits as a viewing experience.

Let me say right off the bat that Soderbergh's film is a feast for the senses and a respite for the psyche.  The art direction, set design, special effects, cinematography, and music score are all superb.  The script, acting, and direction do NOT belie common sensibilities as many reviewers I've read, both professional and amateur, seem to suggest.  The characters involved are ""real"" and are well-grounded in social, scientific, and psychological reality--with important exceptions which I won't divulge.  It's this ""human"" groundedness which makes the strange happenings on the space station orbiting Solaris so compelling.

The beautiful yet ominous face of the planet Solaris overhangs the proceedings as if it were the sword of Damocles.  Its presence is less of a mysterious shroud as much as an active interested observer, constantly peeking through the station's observation portals and visiting the minds of its visitors as they dream.  Initially, we're less interested in its scientific bases then in its machinations: Is it well-disposed or nefarious?  We can never really nail its intentions since those humans it affects seem themselves to determine how they are affected.  It's only later that we're engaged in the planet's scientific makeup as the station's crew plan a retreat to the familiar ""human"" machinations of Earth.

This is a film whose arc and rhythms are perfectly in tune.  The thoughtful and curious viewer is thoroughly engaged from beginning to end.  If there's one area left wanting it's that I wished it would have delved even deeper and more engagingly into the psyches of its two main characters (those of George Clooney and Natascha McElhone) and of the others on the space station both living and dead; i.e. the hows and whys of planet Solaris and its cosmic relationship to human existence.  I was left wanting more, which many would proclaim to be a sign of the film's success.  I have to agree, but it also left me wanting to see the original three-hour Russian film of this title to see if my wants would be further fulfilled.

By all means, do NOT feel obligated to view the added featurettes.  They are entirely antithetical to the spirit of this film and add absolutely nothing of value---they are worse than worthless.  I've viewed the DVD film twice and have not yet felt compelled to listen to the running commentary.  Somehow, any commentary would seem superfluous.",1124668800,6,2606,5.018604651162791
1882143,3,B00009ATIX,"... then again, maybe not.

This is the story of a space station where the crew has cut off communications with earth. A security force is sent to investigate but disappears - unfortunately we never find out where they disappeared to or even if they came to harm.  George Cloony plays Chris Kelvin, a civilian psychologist on earth. He is approached and asked to go to the space station to investigate what is happening with the crew and, since one of the crew members is a close friend of his, they think he may be able to assist the crew from a psychological standpoint and save the mission. Okay, so you can see we're already on pretty shaky ground here. Civilian with no training and trips to outer space don't mix well.

Anyway, When he arrives on the ship there are just two crew members left. His friend has already committed suicide by the time he gets there and there is no mention of anyone else or anything else regarding what may have happened to other people. Anyway, the two remaining crew members don't appear in the movie much after the initial opening. The remainder of the movie is focused on his relationship with his dead wife who mysteriously appears on the ship in his locked room. That's just the opening, and it doesn't get much better.

There are lots of scenes where they just stare at each other without speaking. Everything is dark - you feel like saying ""why doesn't anyone turn on the lights!""  You wonder if anything is ever going to happen. It was one of the quietest, darkest movies I've ever watched - highly reminiscent of 2001 Space Odyssey. Some people may like this movie, but I'm willing to bet a higher percentage will be on the fence like I am, or just plain dislike it.",1114387200,2,1711,4.506451612903226

In this case, a psychologist from Earth is assigned to a space station orbiting a strange planet (sun?) called Solaris, to sort out what has been driving the crew to suicide and murder. By the time he gets there, only two crew-members remain alive - and he starts getting visits from an alien impersonating his dead wife.  It doesn't take him long to form an emotional attachment to her, even though he knows on an intellectual level that it can't really be her.  She acknowledges that she's formed out of his memories of her - so, even if he remembers some things wrong, that's how she'll appear - and this could have been interesting to explore.  But we never learn much more than that - what these aliens really are, whether their intention is malevolent or benign, what they really want - and in fact, we never learn much of *anything* in this movie.  It's all scenery (and not very interesting scenery, at that), long meaningless pauses, unpleasant background music; it drags endlessly toward absolutely no resolution.  By the end (finally!), you're not even sure what really happened.  I suppose that was the point, but it's neither insightful nor satisfying.  Had this story been condensed into half an hour, it might have been a nice ""mood piece"" - but movie-length, it was just soporific.  The only reason I give it two stars instead of one, is due to the pure visual appeal of George Clooney and Natascha McElhone.

1882148,5,B00009ATIX,"The movie Solaris based on the book is not a great movie but it is brilliant for the questions it raises when one stops to consider the implications. What is Solaris trying to communicate to us? Is it just trying to please us, toy with us or is it trying to teach us something? Each is searching for the truth as a scientist and a human being. One of the themes portrayed in this story is the search for truth. The two main methods of searching for it are outwardly through science and inwardly through inner enquiry. Further more each character in the story is forced to face a conflict within themselves and with each other about what is real and what is not.

Let's start with the question, ""What is love?"" Kelvin is in love with Rheya (again) but not the real Rheya... Rheya is in every detail exactly taken from Kelvin's memory. Although he knows that she is not the same person the love he feels for her is real because it is based on a real person in his past.

First let's look at the differences between he two Rheya's. We know that physically there are two Rheya's, we know one is real from earth and one is 'real' as in recreated living functioning human (but not the same person) in Solaris. We also could suggest that there may also be at some point behavioural differences between the two Rheya's. The Solaris Rheya's is programmed by Kelvin's memory and the Earth Rheya is not allowing the Earth Rheya more freedom of choice of behaviour.

Now let's explore Rheya from Kelvin's point of view. Kelvin is plagued by the fact that Rheya on the space station is not real. He knows she is not the same women. The Rheya on earth was real, the Solaris Rheya is just a copy based on his memory (his stored perception of her). At this point begin to realise that there is actually no difference, from Kelvin's point of view, between the Earth Rheya and the Solaris Rheya. The Rheya on earth was never anything more than Kelvin's perception of her.

Going further we realise that this is actually exactly how it works for all of us in our relationships on earth. So we ask ourselves, ""What is love?"" and we realise that our love is actually based not on the real person but on our perception of that person. Our feelings for another person are based on an inner relationship between ourselves and the mental image we have created of that person in our minds. This mental image is constantly updated by our perception of that person. Our perception is individual and biased, modified by our life's experience and many other factors. None of this is reality; none of this is truth and can never be argued as truth. However there is no other way to experience the world. We live in this fantasy, we have no choice. The only thing we can choose is be aware (in thought and action) that we live in a fantasy (a mental representation that is different from physical reality) or we can pretend that our fantasy it is real.

Let's not stop there; we can go further, if it is like this with Kelvin (Subject) and Rheya (object) in relationship then is it true for all subject object relationships? Between Kelvin and everything he perceives? We know that there is a physical reality, that there is an ultimate truth but we also know that it is impossible to reach using our same object subject based experience of reality. So the question remains what is left. ""How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?"" - Arthur Conan Doyle

The story reveals that in essence the scientist and the spiritual human are the same... both seekers of the truth albeit with different approaches. The scientist searches for the Truth externally through subject object observation of the world. He seeks a way to study the world without his bias of perception so he devises methods to do this validation 'mental concepts' using instruments, methodology and peer review.

A spiritual human searches for the Truth internally. His search begins realising (consciously or unconsciously) that he is living in his own fantasy (a mentally constructed world). Deciding it is impossible to move beyond subject object relationships by looking externally he seeks internally. He seeks to examine the cause of this and then to see if he can move beyond it. He seeks to wake from this fantasy but finds nothing but his own seeking. It may take him a long time to realise that the answer is obvious. He thinks he has found nothing but he has found the looking. So this is where he turns his attention.

The subject object mind creates separation between the two. Separation will always cause an indirect experience and thus no experience or understanding of truth (reality). In order to experience the truth (reality) there can be no separation from it. He decides to turn his attention away from examining objects (the observed) towards examining the subject (the observer; his awareness; his consciousness). Who is looking? Who is being aware? Is it possible to exist in a state of awareness without object? Is that reality (truth)? Solaris raises the possibility that in order to understand the universe we must first understand ourselves.

1882164,5,B00009ATIX,"First for the caveats to this review: I haven't read Lem's story, I haven't seen the original Russian film of it, and I haven't read the 264 other reviews currently shown here (though I might work through some of them later), I won't begin to try to summarize the plot, I'm not a particular fan of Lem or science fiction or of the director or any of the actors, and I'm writing this after having watched the film 3 times (very rare for me) over the past 6 months. So with that all out of the way...

I find this film to be excellent for several reasons: a moving and thought provoking story is probably the most obvious, but also excellent understated direction and straightforward, sincere acting are others. Good casting, too, I'd have to say -- you don't spend the movie thinking, oh, I'm watching (actor's name) playing (description of character). Good on-screen chemistry between Clooney and McElhone would be essential to this film, and that comes through, along with the director's interesting treatment of them. It helps that it's also definitely different from the vast majority of other sci-fi or non-sci-fi movies out there in its level of emotion. Part of that difference, and perhaps another reason for its quality, is its ambiguity. If there's one warning that should go out to those considering seeing it, it's that they shouldn't see it if they enjoy clearly defined outcomes.

The movie grapples courageously with LOSS, which is essentially what it's about, and you forget it's sci-fi almost throughout, except when the occasional unavoidable scene/line reminds you. But you're enveloped in a story about connections between people, how they relate to each other, the sometimes unavoidable selfishness of everyone in their perspectives on the world, and what that can cost. It has gotten richer to me through the subsequent viewings, perhaps because you see more or perhaps because you just have more time to sink into these themes.

I really cannot understand why people would DISlike this film (unless again they're just searching for something much more straightforward), but I think many would like it, even if they don't normally like science fiction in general, because of the degree of emotion and though and humanity in the story.",1102636800,9,2255,4.9603174603174605

It is certainly not boring as some other reviews suggest, but of course is not everyone's cup of tea. This is merely my opinion and is only as valid as the rest of these reviews.",1100908800,5,643,4.551724137931035
1882166,4,B00009ATIX,"This review refers to the DVD release of Solaris, the remake. Just a couple of notes from the outset:

(1) This film will not be well-liked by most people. There are a ton of spoilers in most reviews, so I'll try to boil it down for its essence to avoid ruining the unfolding of the movie should you choose to see it: a guy goes to a spaceship where weird things are happening and sees his dead wife. Maybe. That's all you need to know about the plot. The movie, some might think is slow, there's no action, it's a head-tripper, and honestly, had I not read the book before and also seen the magnificent Tarkovsky original, I might not have followed what was going on. As such, while I really enjoyed it, I can't call it either a great film nor one that is likely to appeal to a broad cross-section of movie watchers. There are some heady issues surrounding reality, consciousness, life and death, and if you take them too seriously you'll find yourself snoozing.

It's definitely in Soderbergh's style, and it's been fun watching him skip between genres in recent years, but it's more like ""The Limey"" and less like ""Erin Brockovich"" if you want to pin it down. While it's not an indy flick -- in the sense it's expensive and bankrolled and produced in Hollywood fashion -- it feels like a small art film or an indy. And please, god, don't expect ""Aliens"" or ""Titanic"" because James Cameron's name is over the credits as Producer.

(2) Both the original book and the Tarkovsky film have much to recommend them, although they also share characteristics of being verbally philosophical and talky which this version most assuredly does not. This version is incredibly tight.

(3) If you're a film student or into the mechanics of film, though, this DVD edition is an utter delight. I can easily see this sequence in a film class curriculum: watch the movie; watch the DVD commentary; read the screenplay; watch the Tarkovsky ""original""; read the Lem original source book; write your term paper.

The DVD contains two interesting but not unusual featurettes on the making of the film. It also includes, somewhat unusually, a complete original screenplay (that you have to page through with the fast forward button). And it contains the customary Director's commentary, featuring director Stephen Soderbergh and producer James Cameron bantering about the movie. (In the honest assessment of Sodbergh, the commentary is ""Just another version of two white guys sitting around talking."")

The two of them discuss nearly every choice that was made in assembling the movie, from lighting and the use of post-production to CGI and whether to rehearse actors or not and dozens of technical tricks. And the movie itself is sort of like a catalog of techniques and effects. I don't mean to imply it's showing off: it simply uses a huge variety of film techniques to move the story along, and Cameron and Soderbergh discuss in the commentary both what works and what didn't work, what reshoots were required, what processes underlay the film, how the rewrites were done, and so forth --  and do it in a rather entertaining way, to this film fan, at least.

And one of the things I enjoyed both about the film and the DVD is the way Soderbergh just endlessly pillages other directors and films: Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarkovsky himself, Eisenstein, heck, even the Lumiere brothers -- even a dash of James Cameron. As Cameron himself says at the end of the commentary, ""There are no new ideas. We're a hundred years into the process of filmmaking now.""

As such, while I enjoyed watching the movie, I rather much more enjoyed immediately re-viewing it with the commentary, and I think this is going to be a keeper for those who like studying technical details. It's like ""Citizen Kane"" in that it comes close to summarizing what the 21st century film-maker has at his or her fingertips (the way ""Kane"" slopped together virtually every technique of 1941 -- rest assured I'm not actually comparing the film's stature to Kane.) There's a bit of what Soderberg immodestly calls ""pure cinema"", visual-only story-telling, which does remind me of ""The Limey"" and some of the silent classics as well as ""2001"" and the original ""Solaris"", and I mean that all in a complimentary sense.

It's also a huge genre-bender. There are elements of slasher flicks, ghost stories, horror, detective mystery, romantic tragedies, a very slight dash of comedy (thanks largely to the great Jeremey Davies in a supporting role), Soviet agitprop, Godard nouvelle vague, 1930s theatre, and who knows what else I missed the first couple of times I saw it.

This is not a flick you're going to want to pick out for Saturday night brain candy, or to change your mood if you're depressed, because it will either bore you or depress you more if you want mood-altering fluff. But it's a good one-timer for those who like the brain-bending what-is-reality film along the lines of Philip K. Dick or Alejandro Almenabar, and a multi-viewer for film school.",1100390400,167,5001,4.810244470314319
1882167,5,B00009ATIX,"Just like the old Talking Heads song, psychologist Chris Kelvin wakes up in his spartan sleeping chamber aboard a space station orbiting the enigmatic planet Solaris to discover his wife Rheya by his side. His beautiful wife, awake, close to his side, easing him out of one nightmare and into another.

There's one minor complication: Rheya has been dead for years.

So there you have it: Kelvin, stunned, having a David Byrne-esque ""Once in a Lifetime"" moment, wondering ""is this my beautiful wife""? And for much of Steven Soderbergh's heartbreaking, masterful, quiet and searing ""Solaris"", the supposition is that maybe that doesn't matter very much.

""Solaris"" is not Soderbergh's finest hour---for that look to ""Kafka"". But that said, it is a quiet masterpiece, a brave film that operates solely on its own terms and offers the viewer absolutely no quarter nor compromise. Surrender yourself and your time to the film's immediacy, just as the survivors on the film's spartan space station give themselves over to the unknowable forces on the planet, and you will probably be as moved as I was.

Based on Stanislaw Lem's novel and reprising the material in Andrei Tarkovsky's epic Russian film, Soderbergh's ""Solaris"" is only incidentally science fiction. It's more a thin skein of science fiction stretched taut across a dense, luminous surface of human pain, of the anguish and fallibility of memory, of love, of love lost, of the possibility of redemption. That's really what Soderberg wants to cut down into, and he wields a brutally sharp scalpel here.

Have you lost the thing you loved most in your life? Have you lost true love? Fine: what would you do if you thought you could reclaim it, salvage the moment you lost it, make things right again?

What would that be worth to you?

What would you do to get it?

That, in essence, is ""Solaris"". Oh yes, to be sure, the plot is about a space station orbiting the mysterious planet Solaris; the station's corporate owners have lost contact with it, and a rescue team is equally silent. The DBA Corporation turns to Clooney's Chris Kelvin (bravely and masterfully played by George Clooney, who owns this film), a psychologist who was a colleague of the station's chief scientist Gibarian, who had sent across a mysterious invitation to Kelvin before the first security team had been dispatched. He arrives to a scene of unnervingly, creepily quiet chaos, with Gibarian dead and the rest of the crew having retreated to their separate quarters, plagued by what they contend are visions.

Much like Polanski's ""The Ninth Gate"", ""Solaris"" suffered from a marketing campaign that perhaps emphasized too much the science fiction elements of the piece. The space station, the planet, the sere, technical, sleek surfaces of the examination rooms and sleeping quarters are merely palletes on which Clooney paints his own internal torment and very private suffering, writ large; the space setting is, like Holocaust-era Warsaw in ""The Pianist"", almost incidental to the movie. This film could have been set anywhere---underground, in the desert, in a skyscraper penthouse.

Soderbergh directs deftly, fluidly, using his technically precise sets as counterpoints to the choices the crew of the space station must make. The acting here is top-notch: Clooney turns in a laser-perfect performance, Natasha McElhone is remarkably poised and completely convincing, Jeremy Davies provides a few wan laughs as the unnerved Snow, and Viola Davis fights the good fight as Gordon, who absolutely, positively will not let the Human Race be undone by good intentions. And here, by the way, is just one of trillions of deft little touches Soderbergh uses, this one hinting of alien invasion: what better way for some vast intelligence to undermine humanity than by burrowing at us through our emotions?

For all the breathtaking expansiveness of the shots, which draw favorable comparison with Kubrick's work in 2001, this is an interior movie, and the film lives or dies on the chemistry and work between Clooney and McElhone. For my money, they are remarkable together. Each scene between them, each line, each breath, each facial contortion, tells; there is not a wasted sequence or shot here, and technically this may very well be Soderbergh's most compact, complete, and least pretentious film.

Tragedy, horror story, dark night of the soul, fable of a love lost---whatever it is, ""Solaris"" is unforgettable.",1100304000,11,4448,5.12

1882170,3,B00009ATIX,"This film is a boring remake of a boring movie based on Stanislaw Lem's fascinating book. The original film is a real endurance test; I have never made it through once without napping. This remake is shorter but coffee is still needed to get through it.

Solaris is a beautiful film, the music is wonderful and it is a faithful homage to the original film, which is part of its problem. Both film versions of the book have long (endless) scenes of the main character looking sad and nothing happens.

To its credit, Clooney's Solaris has some of that boring fat trimmed off but I was hoping that there would be more scenes showing Solaris as described in the book (hello, special effects department?). The original film took the same ""men trapped in a floating tin can"" approach. I was hoping for a film with a larger scope.

  It is true that Solaris is not so much about the strange planet but how people in the space station orbiting this weird planet are affected by it. But Solaris is represented by a big glowing ball, looking like something taken from an old Star Trek episode. No details are explored in this film, and I was expecting that in 2004.

  Solaris is not bad but it could have been better. Its boring in (lots of) spots but if you are in the right mood then this will not bother you too much.",1098230400,5,1312,4.4149377593361
1882171,4,B00009ATIX,"As a huge fan of Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey, I have to say that the Soderbergh version of Solaris is indeed 2001 for 2002.

Howso?  Well, first, the visuals speak volumes.  Wordless images combined with the haunting score are enough to really bring one in - if you will let it.  (Personally, I could stare at the Solaris planet and listen to the score for hours on end.)  Solaris is a major player in this movie, even though the planet never utters a word.

While I'm not a huge George Clooney fan, I found his performance in this film to be suprisingly appropriate.  Not too many words - the sense of the profound is not lost.  The unexplaniable is left unexplained, and when we are honest with ourselves there will always be something we are forced to accept as unexplained.

The movie also explores our preconcieved notions of the world around us (or, more accurately, the universe around us) and also takes us into the mind of a man haunted by the death one one whom he loves.  As an individual who has experienced losses many times before, this movie was almost therapuetic for me.

Certainly Solaris has it's weak points.  For those who are purists, it omits a great deal of Lem's original story and the setting is ever-so-subtly changed.  However, Solaris is still a movie that represents for the early twenty-first century what 2001 presented in the sixties.  A movie of reflection and contemplation on the mysteries of the universe.",1095379200,2,1445,4.660079051383399
1882182,4,B00009ATIX,"I clearly need to go back and rewatch the Andrei Tarkovsky

version, but as i just watched the Clooney one it strikes me

that Solaris is a representation of a Heaven.

Rheya gets there the old fashioned way -- she dies on earth.

But the scientists get there the wrong way (by travelling to

the space station).

It's a view of Heaven where you get to spend eternity with

the the ones you love (not the one with the angels playing

harps on clouds, or being absorbed into a universal

consciousness), living in the place you love the most, at

peace and complete safety

i'm not saying that the space station is some idyllic paradise;

or that it would be possible to travel to the surface of solaris

to experience it -- but the energy of Solaris is the combined

Souls off all the inhabitants (so maybe it is the universal

consciousness version of Heaven as well)",1094256000,4,868,4.439490445859873

1882184,4,B00009ATIX,"For those of you who have read other reviews let me add something I think people are missing about this movie.

The female scietist on board is right, if she was ugly you would not want her therefore she is pretty, ect.

 the copies seem to be made to seduce or want the humans to like them. The first copy of George Clooney's wife appears to be an exact duplicate of her, still loving him and wanting to sit next to him. He cannot deal with her like that and sends her into space.

 The second copy of her however has a completely different personality and viewpoint, not sure who she is, how she got there and is not sure if she can deal with it. (right down Clooneys alley as he is a psycologist).

 Now he seems attracted to the second one and wants her no matter what.

 the movie is slow paced but that didn't bother me, it seems to be a story of second chances or as close to a second chance as you can get..if you see the movie in this light it is a nice love story with a happy ending - solaris style.

 This movie accomplished, although in a different way, what everyone wants to see in every movie - a happy ending.",1093651200,4,1126,4.095890410958904
1882185,2,B00009ATIX,"There were aspects to like about this film, but the overall package was not appealing.  Based upon the video jacket, I expected some suspense, a good deal of science fiction stuff, and yes, some action.  Instead, I fed on haunting music, pretty outerspace scenery, and very slow motion story that could be summarized:  Love that ends tragically, when redone, ends up being sadly undone.

The main character, played by Clooney, is a psychologist, mourning the suicide death of his lover.  He goes to Solaris, a space station, to find out why the crew has been out of communication.  When he arrives, he quickly succumbs to the seduction of the Solaris system...and we spend the rest of the story agonizing with Clooney over whether what once was might--even if in shadows--can be recaptured.

This might have been a great story, an intriguing novel...but on film, it came across as a dark, milingering attempt at visual poetry-science fiction.  It was an awkward mix that did not work for me.

Bottom-line:  Stick with science fiction or love tragedies...don't subject yourself to this failed mix--unless you also like ketchup on your ice cream.",1093305600,,1144,5.005291005291006
1882186,5,B00009ATIX,"Sadly, this seems to be one of those films where you either ""get it"" or you don't.  The first time I saw this film, it affected me in such a way that it was very hard to return to reality.  It left me silent, thinking about life, love, what it would be like to have a second chance in these circumstances.  Would I take it, even knowing the circumstances?  Would I do it to try to right a wrong, or would I do it to simply comfort my soul?  It left me in a pensive, almost poetic mood for a number of hours.  Yes, it's that good.

Clooney and McElhone are stellar (no pun intended) on screen together, as well as in scenes without the other.  The real beauty of this film is that you're allowed to *feel* what's going on more than just *seeing* it as they don't act out every little tiny thing.  There's lots of nuance, and the soundtrack is perfect for it, only enhancing, not detracting.  It's much different than your average film that hits you over the head with the same point time after time just to make sure you understand what they're trying to tell you.  This film doesn't do that, thankfully, and it's much better for it.

If you're one of the people who's seen the original film, you owe it to yourself to judge this film on its own merits, not in comparison.",1093132800,7,1271,4.228215767634855
1882187,4,B00009ATIX,"Be prepared to be patient while watching Solaris. Based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem it's influenced heavily by the atmospheric Russian version directed by the great Andrei Tarkovsky [one of the great directors of Russian cinema], Solaris is by Hollywood standards very introspective and slowly paced.

The basic storyline is that a space station has basically stopped functioning and its crew has gone mad.  A psychologist [`Chris Kelvin played by George Clooney] requested by the crew's commander is sent out to the remote planet to investigate the matter.  At this point many readers may be thinking `Aliens' or something along similar lines, but thankfully this isn't so. The `monster' if there is one, is one's own psyche from where the Planet Solaris [whose vast ocean is a life form of sorts- not really delved into in this version] creates real life copies.

What Kelvin discovers is a ship who's crew has been driven to insanity by the real life constructions of people from their past.  What if a loved one, now long dead, re-appeared in the flesh in your own life?  For some in the crew this is just far too much to bear.  Kelvin himself succumbs as his wife [or a `copy' of her], who committed suicide years before, appears in real life form dazed and confused by what's happened.  His reaction to her, his fear and guilt, are the heart of the film.

While the novel and the Russian film are more philosophical, Director Steven Soderberg's Solaris is more a love story with philosophical connotations.  Guilt, regret, confusion and fear play havoc with Kelvin and the crew.  In the end the psychologist succumbs to his psyche while the crew's physicist shed's any link with her own constructs.

Solaris doesn't quite rise to the level of artistry as Tarkovsky's version and it eschews  most the scientific and philosophical aspects of Lem's novel [and unfortunately an interesting sub-plot on the history of the discovery of Solaris].  Judged on its own terms and relative to what's being released by Hollywood today, Solaris is a very adult film that delves into the human psyche quite well.  On those terms I think it's a success.",1092355200,2,2145,4.870523415977962
1882188,3,B00009ATIX,"I have my doubts whether a novel by a writer as experimental in his style as Stanislaw Lem could be successfully transferred to film, but Steven Soderbergh gives it a pretty good whack. George Clooney is Chris Kelvin, a shrink who is called to investigate strange phenomena at a space station circling an unnamed star (or planet, or something) that are driving its crew nuts. Kelvin's wife, Rheya (played affectingly by Natascha McElhone, whom I hadn't remembered seeing before, though she was in The Truman Show), died by her own hand and he's still grieving -- until she comes back to him on the station. Somehow, the star (or planet, or whatever) creates an environment in which people are visited in their dreams by whomever they want most to see, a situation not conducive to retaining one's proper outlook on reality, not to mention one's sanity. The start of the story is slow and somewhat confusing. That's true of the novel, as well, but a film isn't a book and it doesn't have the luxury of expecting the viewer to be unendingly patient. Once the plot picks up the pace, though, it's really not bad.",1092096000,3,1109,4.6923076923076925
1882189,2,B00009ATIX,"For Sci-Fi lovers this is probably a great movie but for people who prefer their romance stories on earth it is a little too spacey.

The director for this film is Steven Soderbergh and he tends to capture all of the scenes in dark close-ups of body parts and profiles while new age subliminal music plays in the background. There are too many moments of quiet and unexplained emotions shrouded in the complexities and visual harshness of a space station. The story is interesting but may have worked better on earth rather than aboard an alien type space mobile. Psychologist Kelvin (played by George Clooney) is called to resolve lost communications aboard a space station in orbit around an alien planet. From this point we are left to contemplate the circumstances taking place aboard the craft.

George Clooney is decent in his role as a space psychologist attempting to resolve a mystery aboard a space station, but he has way too many dark close-ups. Aboard the ship he tries to deal with eerie circumstances that involve dead loved ones seeming to come back to the crew members in dreams or is it in reality. Jeremy Davies plays a kooky crew member who actually looks a little too much like Charles Manson to be likable! Clooney's wife is played nicely by Natascha McElhone. Clooney and McElhone pass back and forth between dreams and reality, future and past during their romance and old issues are brought forth in an attempt to re-configure them into something more reasonable. But the viewers are left to decide what truth is and what is misconstrued by the alien infection.

The ending of this film is abstract and will leave one with a choice between heaven, dreams or reality as the existing environment. Will the future of love exist only under controlled circumstances or will life continue as normal far from the glow of Solaris?",1092009600,6,1847,4.80188679245283

This movie explores questions of love, how love can go wrong, how it leaves a void when it's over, and mostly, how our memories of someone are not the same as who that person really was.  These questions are never directly present, but hidden in the dialogue between Chris and Rheya.
Anyone looking for a Sci-Fi flick will be dissappointed at the methodical, calm pace of the movie. Someone looking for a love story will be dissappointed by the personal boundaries in Chris and Rheya's relationship.

Don't expect it to be your standard sci-fi fare with critters and explosions; likewise, don't expect it to be the Lem novel on film.  It's an independent work and just thrilling.  Each time I watch it (or listen to the score since I also bought the soundtrack CD), I'm drawn into a fantasy realm.  I have seen few movies deal with loss in such a provocative and mesmerizing way.

That said, the book is one of my favorites, and is an exciting, mind-bending journey into the nature of consciousness and an incredible 'what-if' of a sentient planet.
This stupid movie tried to turn that into a love story.
Yes, the apparition that looks and 'thinks' she is his wife, and unaware that 'she' is dead is a psycological shock, but turning it into a romance simply had nothing to do with the book.  A different story entirely.
There are so many opportunites for excitement, special effects available in the book.  (Helicopter rides into transient foaming structures, historical replays of previous expiditions, etc.)
I often envisioned an exciting dramatic movie--without losing any of the intellect.  I also was very excited about this movie until I had to found myself nodding off--something I NEVER do in a movie.
If you are interested in a good movie adaptation, check out the original directed by Andrei Tarkovsky.  There is an excellent DVD produced by Criterion Collection.  (Just skip the boring highway scene in the beginning, and you have a great movie.)

Clooney is superb. I've never seen him work like this, in a loose, almost extemporaneous fashion. The script barely holds clues and so a lot of work is involved for the viewer, which is probably why this film just slips by most people.

Saying that it is protracted, dull, painfully slow and confusing is probably being kind, as what started out as a ""great idea for a movie"" has succumb to an over self indulgent directors depiction of a fairly bland screenplay. George Clooney travels to a distant galaxy where he meets his deceased wife via almost tangible flashback sequences and seems to be part of a special mission to discover the meaning of life, or something like it. Unfortunately, when one recalls, or even reads older Sci Fi literature of the type so ground braking by the likes of Isaac Asimov, Phillip K Dick and the like, one thing is painfully obvious. Great Fiction literature lives and flourishes in the subjective imagination of the reader NOT the viewer. And it is incredibly difficult to succesfully make the transition from page to screen without losing a lot in the process. I have not actaully read the book that this movie is based on, but feel sure this depiction will pale in comparison to a probably reasonable, if pulp style story. This will be one I'm sure Mr Clooney will wish to forget in a hurry, and those that can endure it to the final frame, will no doubt feel the same. Avoid!",1082505600,5,1323,4.610169491525424

This is a movie that gets better every time you watch it. Chances are, if you didn't understand this movie, you are stupid [no offense]. I only say this because so many people complain about it being too confusing and random. Perhaps these people never took basic philosophy or even English courses that would help them catch the important clues.
Another complaint that I noticed is that this movie was slow. A lot of people say that. I suppose that they were expecting this to be an Action/Horror sci-fi instead of an intellectual one. Sorry folks: This movie is for thinkin' people and not for the average public-schooled American.
Here's are some tips:
-If you don't get the movie, watch it again. Like Fight Club, this tip could help you understand it a lot better so as you can appreciate what's going on.
-If you think it's too slow, stop watching it. You obviously can't handle the movie or any of its messages. The best thing to do is to quickly eject the DVD and replace it with ""Predator II"", which I am sure is more to your liking.",1082246400,16,1051,4.536842105263158

1882212,2,B00009ATIX,"""Solaris"" is a conceptually idealistic love story couched in a Science Fiction film that is highly reminiscent of Sc-Fi films and novels in the fifties and sixties.  That being said, it does accomplish that to a certain degree but the overall outcome of the film is a less than spectacular film that leaves one looking at their watch as the DVD plays on.
One of the most surprising aspects of this film is that one of its primary producers is James Cameron himself.  Typically, if his name is stamped on a project it is destined for success but that unfortunately doesn't happen here.  Perhaps had he taken the director's chair for this film it might've been a touch better.
Performance wise, all of the actors involved did a good job with their respective roles, the script not withstanding.  To date, I would have to say that George Clooney's departure from the small screen to big screen has been a more or less lesson in hit and miss, with this film scoring as a miss.
Director Steve Soderbergh, best known for films such as ""Erin Brokovich"" and ""Ocean's Eleven"" more or less stepped outside of his comfort zone with this film and the seeming end result of his traveling in the Science Fiction lane leaves one to the conclusion that he probably won't travel in it again.
The Premise:
George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin who is a company psychologist sent to a space station orbiting an extremely mysterious planet.  He's sent there after the crew stops responding to hails from the company and one of those crew members sends a message specifically asking for him.  Upon his arrival he finds that some of the crew is dead and he too starts experiencing the same problems that everyone else had.  A few years prior, his wife had died and now, in the middle of his first night on the station she shows up in his room with him...
What follows from there is a story that is quite different in and of its self where the primary characters are trying to cope with these mysterious characters from their pasts showing up.
Overall, I'd recommend this film primarily as a rental to most movie watchers.  Of no doubt is that there are some out there who would find an appreciation for this films approach unfortunately, I'm not one of them.  {ssintrepid}

1882214,5,B00009ATIX,"When I read Stanislaw Lem's book many years ago I remember Solaris as a living ocean with peculiar qualities.  The planet somehow managed an unstable orbit between two stars.  This is what caught earth's scientist's attention in the first place. Part of the search for intelligent life in the cosmos.  Lem's intelligent life is wonderfully baffling.  He looks at the human need to personify and communicate.  But to communicate something you have to have some common ground.  Lem's stunning premise was to look at an attempt at human-alien communication very uncompromisingly.
  Soderbergh focusses the movie on the question, ""How do we perceive ourselves and others and how vital is this to the communication process?""  Lem and Soderbergh both see the story from the eys of Psychiatrist Kelvin [Clooney].  Soderbergh's opening scenes stress this man's grief and attempts to recover from his wife's suicide.  He's soon asked by a long time astronaut friend for help with a delicate situation on a space station orbiting Solaris.  Wham! In no time Kelvin is totally befuddled at the mysteries he sees as he boards the space station.  There is almost no dialogue, revealing camera shots period.  Two surviving astronauts offer cryptic advice.  Snow says ""I can tell you what is going on, but that really wouldn't tell you what is going on""  Gordon says ""Until it happens to you, there is really no point in discussing it"".  Not much help from our director there.  What ""happens"" is the living ocean presents each astronaut with a dreadful gift.
  The alien's ""gift"" to the earthling's was to generate in near perfect [to atomic] detail, the flesh and blood of whatever life was preoccupying the dreams of the astronauts.  Kelvin's visitor is his ex-wife Rheya. Clooney does a great job portraying Kelvin's repulsive reaction at first.  He banishes the mysterious woman, who couldn't be anything but a monster.  When she soon reappears, he opens his mind and begins dialogue with this person, played with wonderful grace and style by McElhone. The physicist on board is obsessed with figuring out how Solaris achieved these creatures and is hell bent on physically destroying them.  Snow's visitor disappeared long back.  And Kelvin approaches hs wife at first as a kind of grief therapy and then is slowly drawn into admiring and actually loving her all over again.  In consistent professional style, he tries to figure out how his memories of Rheya were manifest by Solaris.  Both he and Rheya look at who she is, and who she is becoming.  And how she is changing him.
  What happens when reality becomes memory, and then memory is slowly warped and faded?  And who am I anyway?  How well do I know my wife of many many years?  And if I leave my kids for four years will I be able to enter their lives as a loving father based on our mutual memories of our past relationship?
The end makes you think about life and death.  Intergalactic mixed-species communication is intense and complex. The soundtrack fits.  The art draws Solaris as a beautiful floating blue nerve bundle.  This movie, like the book, is very imaginative, lively, challenging and original.  It casually dances between the spiritual and metaphysical and physical.  Not for everybody but this really isn't science fiction.  It's something else.",1079913600,13,3310,4.959927140255009

An extended meditation on love, loss & memory, this film takes the viewer deep into the heart of Being, far below the trivial layers of the Everyday.

The filmmaker trusts in the intelligence & depth of soul of those who do watch. Everything contributes to the establishing & sustaining of its mood: gorgeous cinematography, haunting music, a tasteful underplaying of special effects.
No, it's not Tarkovsky's masterpiece -- but it's not meant to be, either. Rather it directs a fine & powerful focus on one aspect of its source material, striving for & achieving an emotionally luminous work of Art. Highly recommended!",1078185600,25,1383,5.0701754385964914
1882217,2,B00009ATIX,"This movie carries has a lot of really heavy themes swimming around in an ill-defined soup.  It never really decides which ones it wants to focus on.
I think the most interesting ones are about control and culpability in relationships.  Kelvin feels responsible for his wife's suicide, so when she reappears he is less concerned with her as a person than he is in making sure he never loses her again.  When it is clear that she is unhappy, it matters very little to him; he will guard the door to make sure she does not get away from him again.  He cannot love her because he is too busy trying to keep her.
There are also some interesting moments about how we remember people vs. how they really are, and I was intrigued by Gordon's fear and desire to do the right thing at all costs, but these themes remain undeveloped -- as does most of the movie.  I haven't read the book or seen the 70's Russian version, but I've got to say that despite so much potential, the actual movie mostly fails.",1076976000,,994,4.351351351351352
1882218,2,B00009ATIX,"This is a barely lukewarm (i.e., almost cold) and overly melodramatic movie. Although short by typical movie standards, by about 20 minutes, it seems to have been twice as long. This is the type of movie that tries to force its self-importance on you. Like the boyfriend or girlfriend that plays hard-to-get and once connected, you wonder what the suspense was all about -- all surface, no substance.
Unfortunately, it seems to be a poor space rendition of movies like ""Sphere"" (which was an excellent book and mediocre movie, but better than this movie) and several others. In other words, a cookie-cutter movie that is run at half-speed.",1076457600,3,639,4.925925925925926
1882219,5,B00009ATIX,"Solaris is NOT a film for everybody. There, I said it. Now, knowing that, you must also know that this is a terrific piece of moviemaking that deserves to be viewed by anyone with interest in cinema.
Another thing you must know about this film is that, even if it's story takes place in space, it is more drama than science fiction. The basic premise of the movie has sci fi roots, but the story plays out more like drama and even suspense than a space/action flick.
George Clooney plays Kelvin, a widower who is called by one of his friends to go to a spaceship orbiting the planet Solaris, because ""he's the only one who can figure out what's happening"". Once he arrives there, he finds a desolate ship, it's only surviving crew made up of creepy Snow (Jeremy Davies) and Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis). After his first night there, Kelvin experiences first hand what Solaris does to people, as his dead wife (Natascha McElhone) suddenly appears by his side. The rest of the film follows Kelvin as he tries to understand what's going on. Is this really his wife or is it something else? Is he dreaming or is this really happening?
The pace of the movie is rather slow, and the acting is quite controlled (for lack of a better word). The sets are amazing, with a retro-futuristic look and some of the camera placements give very interesting takes. The special effects are very wisely used here. As stated before, this is not an action movie, but it is placed in space and there's plenty of takes of a few spaceships and of the planet itself (very nice looking, by the way).
If there's another thing you should know is that the movie was written and directed by Steven Soderbergh, a man who was nominated for Best Director twice in the same year (Erin Brockovich and Traffic) and actually won one of them, and produced by James Cameron, the same guy who wrote, produced, directed and edited the highest grossing movie of all time, Titanic. This is a very interesting coupling, and I promise you the commentary track on the DVD is not to be missed.
To conclude, this movie is a remake of the 1972 russian film (Solyaris) based on Stanislav Lem's book.",1075334400,4,2144,4.542635658914729
1882220,1,B00009ATIX,"This movie won my ""Worst of the year"" award. I thought this film had great potential, but it never lived up to its potential. I really wanted to see this movie, about after seeing it. I wish I had seen ""Dude Where's my car"" instead.",1074902400,3,232,4.177777777777778
1882221,2,B00009ATIX,"SOLARIS isn't like most sci-fi adventures. In fact, it isn't like most movies of any kind. It begins with psychologist Chris Kelvin being sent to the space station orbitting the planet Solaris in a last-ditch effort to re-establish contact. When he gets there he finds the remnants of the crew haunted by some strange phenomena. They are playing host to some uninvited ""visitors"". In due course, Kelvin gets a visitor of his own, in the form of his dead wife.
The hows, whys and wherefors of this situation could have made for a pretty interesting and intense tale. There are some intense and emotional moments as Kelvin tries to grapple with the situation and his own personal baggage, and the acting is generally good, too. As one character comments, however, ""there are no answers, only questions"". That's an accurate summation of SOLARIS. It raises lots of questions in the viewers mind, but never answers any of them. Instead, after providing almost no action and deadening viewer's senses with ponderous visual interludes accompanied only by station background noise, the story concludes without any real resolution and without any explanation of what was going on.
SOLARIS has its plusses, but it isn't a movie most people will enjoy watching. Fortunately, I got my copy essentially free. It came packaged with a movie that I definitely wanted and at the price of a single DVD. Don't spend your money on this unless you've seen it and are sure you want it.",1074556800,4,1463,4.903225806451613

1882223,1,B00009ATIX,"I must admit I am more than a bit biased here because I am a Tarkovsky fan. When I heard that Hollywood wanted to do the remake I just fell clean out of my chair. Then I managed to see this thing, although I did not want to, and I must say that although I would have given it a little bit of credit for maybe trying an alternative take on Stanislaw Lem's book of the same name, this one just ends up being not that engaging with an uneventful plot that does not even try. You can cook this one up anyway you want but this is just plain bad.
Clooney walks circles around every other actor here and gives it all he has got. Seeing him going crazy, breaking away piece by piece, was fantastic but the film is really not that inspired and ends up looking like a 2001 ripoff (including the DVD cover).
The metaphysics behind the story are messed up in the worst possible way. Somewhere along the line the director just gave up and decided that the love story was what this film was about and the metaphysics where just pointless to engage in. So he is left doing this thing about Clooney trying to establish if being with a space ghost that looks and feels like his wife is the same thing as being with his wife and ponders over this again and again and again... until you just snooze away into your hybernation chamber wanting to wake up when Clooney draws his conclusion... which is like 76 Billion light years away at the rate this film moves along.
It is amazing that although the director tried to get back to Lem's grass roots and away from Tarkovsky that he still made garbage out of it. The film may *look* good but that only lasts so long. Producer James Cameron was obviously absent from the whole thing, still in Titanic na-na-land, until the distributors put it out. There is nothing here to even remotely suggest that the talent wanted anything less than to get it over and done with and the hell out of the studio so that they could get on with their lives. To be honest they should have just burnt the negatives and cut their losses. This one is not something good to have on your CV - or for anyone to see it for that matter either.
This film did not break the bank, but it did do a number of things. Darren Aronofsky lost his production funds for ""The Fountain"" because Hollywood was afraid that it would bomb like this one. I think that it was terrible that Hollywood would do that to such a talent like Aronofsky based on this over-rated director's botch up job.
Sadly this is just more proof that some gems should be left alone. Why try to fix what is not broken?",1073520000,3,2578,4.274028629856851
1882224,1,B00009ATIX,"George Clooney did good when he was in ER.  Then he decided to be a big shot and I haven't seen one movie he was in that was good.  Every movie he is in is not his movie.  The best thing about ""The Perfect Storm"" was Mark Wahlberg.  The best thing about ""Batman"" was the scenery.  The best thing about ""Solaris"" was the ending.

1882225,2,B00009ATIX,"I recall seeing the original Tarkovsky film in the then dirty and dingy Cinema Village on E. 12th Street. It struck me as an ambitious mess, at times, even crude, hardly crying out for a ""re-make"". Unfortunately, egos not reasons rule in Hollywood.
That said, I have enjoyed the non-commercial films of Mr. Soderbergh (THE LIMEY; sex, lies, and videotape,etc.) as opposed to his commercial (ERIN BROCKOVITCH, TRAFFIC,etc.) ones. This time, Mr. Soderbergh's creativity seems to have been subordinate to the company he kept during its making. The filmakers seem so determined to make the viewer prostrate before their consideration of ""serious issues"", the film becomes pervaded by a smugness that renders the material as leaden, inert and lifeless as a small moon.",1072742400,2,763,5.211382113821138
1882226,2,B00009ATIX,"The argument for Solaris is that it is an intelligent, though provoking literary movie based in a science-fictional context. One reviewer calls it a ""taut psychological experience that will leave you breathless."" It is not. It is simplistic and unchallenging. The emotional connection between Clooney and his wife is never convincing enough to produce the conundrum of circumstances that are portrayed. I did enjoy the movie. It was beautiful to watch and the performances were excellent, but it simply is not psychologically, emotionally or intellectually intense enough to justify the slow and drawn out pace. It had potential, but comes up short.",1072569600,2,649,5.372549019607843
1882227,5,B00009ATIX,"Seems like this movie has divided reviewers between ""boring"" and ""superb"".  I fall into the latter category.  I think Solaris is the best movie I've seen all year - and this has been a year when I've watched an average of 4 a week as I catch up on years of not seeing any.
Solaris is not, strictly, SF.  It's a deeply affecting humanist story set (mostly) in space.  It has more layers than a wedding cake and the performaces are mostly excellent, particluarly Clooney and McElhone.  (Although I did find Jeremy Davies kind of annoyingly affected.)
I kept waiting for Solaris to let me down with some kind of Hollywood cliche and was almost dreading the ending being just that.  But it just kept getting better.  The chemistry between Clooney and McElhone is amazing and the dialogue in Solaris - especially between these two - is faultless.
So forget the SF bit (despite the amazing sets and photography) and enjoy Solaris for what it is - an incredibly involving and thoughtful look at the human condition : regret, longing, religion, the afterlife, etc., etc.
PS  I have never written a review before but this movie needs the balance of opinion adjusted here at Amazon - I'd hate for you to miss it.  I think it will become a classic.",1072483200,8,1237,4.586363636363636
1882228,2,B00009ATIX,"Natascha McElhone may be a fine actress but her 'who am I, where am I?' portrayal of a deceased woman materializing in outer space lacks much conviction of whatever the film is trying to convince us of. There are moments of intense drama here; George Clooney blankly staring at a torn jagged hole in the spaceship wall, but there is also a dreary unsensational flashback romance occupying most of the film that moves like a wedding march to a funeral drum and does little to build suspense or understanding. The movie intersperses to the image of pink neon gasses surrounding the planet Solaris constantly as if saying, to increasing annoyance, 'meanwhile back on the ranch"". ""Solaris"" could have been intriguing if it had realized it's psychological and cinematic potential as alternative science-fiction. Come to think of it, haven't I seen all this before, albeit on a much smaller budget, in an episode of the original ""Star Trek""?",1071878400,,935,4.961783439490445
1882229,4,B00009ATIX,"If you're looking for a different kind of science fiction movie, this one might be worth checking out.  Unlike most sci-fi, it has nothing to do with space battles, the colonization of alien planets or anything like that.  The plot of this film is a bit more introspective and perhaps even cerebral.
The movie has an eerie but not scary tone to it.  The story can also be described as erotic in timbre, although there is no nudity.  The subtle but pulsing soundtrack lends a hand to tell the story in a memorable fashion.  If you like movies with a mysterious flavor to them, you're bound to enjoy this one.
The basic premise of the movie centers around a research station that is way out there orbiting above a planet called Solaris.  While there, the crew encounters an ambivalent alien force and strange things begin to happen.  A shrink from Earth (George Clooney) is called in to investigate.
Unfortunately, instead of clearing things up, things get even stranger once the psychologist arrives at the station.  As there are so few crew on the station, the rest of the movie has more of a feel of a play than a standard film.
The one motif that passed thru my mind as I watched this film was the TWILIGHT ZONE.  If you like TZ and are open to watch a very different kind of sci-fi film, this one might be for you.  As a bonus, some of the special effects are downright spectacular and really bring out the capabilities of your HDTV / DVD setup.",1070150400,3,1448,4.47148288973384
1882230,4,B00009ATIX,"Now, I have yet to see another Steven Soderburgh film, but in a day where modern film is relegated to dishing out fast-paced, spelled-out-for-you, rehashed action plots with crazy camera angles, 30-second editing, and pointless ""big-star"" cameos, it was a refreshment to see such an elegant film as this re-telling of Stanislaw Lem's novel, Solaris. While the pacing of the film seems to be ""slow and boring"" to many people (due to it's complete lack of car chases, stereotype bashing, and toilet humor), each scene in Solrais seems (in my opinion) to be paced to perfection, setting the stage for character interactions that do exactly what each scene is supposed to do: reveal something about the characters. Each frame of this film seemed like a painting to me, which echoed the importance of the many silent sequences, utilizing a single picture to tell us so much more about the characters than can be said with the forced dialogue and watered-down character motivations that seem to plague the majority of modern American cinema. Each member of the cast gave an exquisite performance, and never before have I seen George Clooney take on such an emotional character.
  Solaris represents exactly what science fiction cinema should have graduated to decades ago: not laser guns, killer robots, space invaders, or lots of special effects action, but new ways of thinking. But don't let the ""sci-fi"" placement of this film fool you. This story isn't about spaceships or aliens or the fate of the universe. It's about what every good story is about: people. For those of you interested in seeing a non-traditional big-budget picture with complex characters and a far from spelled-out plot, give this film a try. For those of you who have nothing but buddy cop films, ""special effects extravaganzas"", or cynical comedies that make you feel more intelligent than the rest of the world in your top 10, try the latest Micheal Bay or Kevin Smith films instead.",1069977600,4,1956,4.978593272171254

1882232,4,B00009ATIX,"Well done above for writing the biggest review of a film about one shot of a man's naked body ever.
Now, the film. It's biggest flaws seem to stem from the script, Soderbergh's own. After his recent, brilliantly scripted movies Out Of Sight, The Limey, Erin Brokovich and Ocean's 11, Soderbergh should take this latest offering as proof that Sex, Lies And Videotape was a one-off. Not only is the dialogue from the present day story vague, it's also very clumsy and banal. I can practically see Soderbergh struggling to write realistic dialogue but not finding the words. I can also see him struggling to fill the space inbetween Kelvin arriving on the station and his dead wife showing up. Somewhere around there should have been the mystery of what happened to the crew, but there's nothing. When Mrs Kelvin shows up, things perk up a bit - Soderbergh had obviously got to the bit he was interested in - but even then the terrific acting (check out the scene where Clooney first sees McElhone on the station, or the ""You keep saying that"" line - phew) is tested to the limit by the clumsy dialogue.
As you can see, it's easy to find faults with this film. What's harder is expressing what's so great about. Performances, asthetic beauty and haunting atmosphere aside, the highlights of the film are not in the main storyline but in the flashbacks. Here, several scenes showing the faulty relationship back on Earth are improvised, and so not hindered by Soderbergh's uninvolving, beat-around-the-bush nonsense. Particularly effective (and moving) is the scene where Kelvin finds out what his wife has done. The more typical Soderbergh cinematography comes into it's own, and the two central performances astound, especially McElhone.
All in all, it comes down to where you, the viewer, are coming from as to whether it is the film's pros or cons are most prominent. If the pros, then the film's great acting, visuals and tone will carry you through the mess. If the cons, then it's just a series of pretty pictures.",1069200000,,2017,4.815561959654179
1882233,3,B00009ATIX,"I had great expectations for this movie and it was nothing like I thought it would be. George Clooney is almost exactly the same character from ER, a broody, arrogant doctor, psychiatrist Chris Kelvin. He meets a woman on a train and they marry after a hot tryst. Later, he is recruited to go to a space station where strange things have been happening to the staff. Upon arriving, he finds only two staff members remain (a physicist and a computer tech) and they are being 'visited' by beings, not aliens and not quite ghosts. Kelvin is visited by an imitation of his wife Rheya (who halfway through the movie we find out had commited suicide) and he wants desperately for things to turn out different than they did on Earth years ago. The scientist on board warns it will not work out and they come up with a plan to destory the visitor. After detroying imitation Rheya, the doctor escapes as the station heads for certain doom. Kelvin has a change of heart and stays behind on Solaris, which may or may not be his utopia.

The timeline is hard to follow and there are a couple of characters who are really unessential to the plot. It's pretty good if your a fan of sci-fi-type movies, it is not so much romantic as it looked to me.",1068163200,3,1234,4.412280701754386

It's not your cup of tea, fine, keep it to yourself.
And the criticism that it doesn't explain enough is such a shallow criticism. Inspiring wonder and firing your imagination is what great art is supposed to do. It's like saying I don't want to see the great pyramids unless someone can tell me exactly how they were built. Tieing things up in neat little packages isn't great art and for that matter isn't even real life.

I found this film thoroughly engrossing on so many levels and am not surprised at all, considering the reality TV that most Americans subsist on, that it didn't go over here. For one thing, I almost never watch a movie twice but I couldn't wait to watch Solaris again and discovered even more layers upon second viewing which inspired more fascinating thoughts-questions about the nature of mortality, love, religion and the human condition. It also really struck an emotional nerve about loss which I suspect makes some people uncomfortable. But it's all done with such grace and poetry from the acting to the cinematography to the haunting musical score. I only wish there were more filmmakers as courageous as Soderbergh who aren't afraid to make a film that speaks quietly and holds to the maxim- still waters run deep.",1067644800,10,1392,4.658536585365853

George Clooney struggles manfully to breathe some life into this stillborn turkey, but it's more than mortal actor can do.  Natascha McElhone (who?) is the forgettable romantic interest, and Jeremy Davies as a crew member is such a mannered ham you long to make him sit on his hands.  At 99 minutes this is not a long movie, but it's a lot longer than it ought to be, if you catch my drift.  Do yourself a favor and save your time and money; I wish I had.

1882237,2,B00009ATIX,"Reasons I didn't like this movie:
1. It contained about ten thousand confusing dream/memory/reality sequences. It seemed to me that the director made the film and was watching it and decided it was boring, so he put in a whole lot of short face shots to make it boring and confusing (which of course is a whole lot better than just boring). Anyway, it was nearly impossible to tell what was real and what was not, and instead of providing the viewer with a thoughtful sense of surreality, depth, isolation, and insight, it simply left the viewer dazed and confused.
2. There was far too little dialogue, and far too much whirring, crackling, disjointed music, and that sound that comes with being pulled into the gravity field of a planet. This of course was combined with the confusing visuals.
3. The acting--what little acting there was; George Clooney was the main character, but mostly we saw unmoving and asleep or a shot of the back of his head. (Anyway the whole movie was too dark to see him anyway but I'll get to that later.)The little dialogue he had was adequately given but did not make up for anything. The supporting characters were mediocre EXCEPT for one guy whose name I couldn't catch, due to the inarticulate speech of his fellow characters. He played his part exceptionally, keeping to character and using incredibly expressive gestures.
4. The movie was dark--it was hard to see faces and expressions, which is what the entire movie was comprised of.
5. Solaris. They kept showing it, with its little electric currents, and at one point an unnamed man said it seemed to be responding to their observations--only unfortunately, no pattern could be detected in the movements of the pink and purple gases. Sorry-I missed something here? And at then end, it kept getting smaller, until it sort of looked like a doorknob, I guess, which was sort of significant, but there was no connection-there was the blue wire and the red wire, and they were telling us as the viewer to put them together.
7. It was hard to detect any sort of plot, theme, meaning, or point in this movie. I know many people would argue otherwise and some would say I'm just too stupid and shallow to see it, but while I admit that I may not be the deepest thinker, I really did try to find a meaning and couldn't. I think it may have been because of all the defects above befuddled whatever point it may have originally had. Or maybe it never had one in the first place. Its based on a book--maybe it was one of those books where the author had an inkling of higher thinking, of deeper thoughts, but couldn't quite grasp the concepts and so retreated into vagueness.
That's it--those are the reasons I didn't like Solaris. If you bothered to read the whole thing, I hope you understand my point of view. (If of course you simply read the first line and then scrolled down to say that my review wasn't helpful, well, I hope that you feel tremendous shame.) If I can get one person to save their money--and hopefully end up donating it to charity--by not buying Solaris, my job is done. Thanks for reading.",1065830400,2,3093,4.594936708860759
1882238,2,B00009ATIX,"At his best, Steven Soderbergh is a high-art director of  straight genre films - his creative-yet-pragmatic editing and camera tricks elevated ""Out of Sight,"" ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""Traffic"" above straight popcorn; his work in ""Traffic"" was particularly impressive considering the material had been tread and retread for 15 years.
 But there is the other side of bizarre and inexplicable failures, like ""Schizopolis"" and inane ""Full Frontal."" ""Solaris"" belongs on that team of Soderbergh's films that has intentions beyond the genre audience, and unlike Soderbergh's ""sex, lies and videotape"" no provocation to tempt them along. It could one of the more beautifully shot films you'll see, with a dark, lush look worth swimming in, but it is minimalist and spare, stiff when it should be touching, and tremendously boring.
 The movie's title refers to a planet in the future, a ball of energy and water, with the capacity to react and manipulate human emotions, specifically that of a science crew sent to research it. Another scientist, Chris Kelvin (Clooney) is sent to the ship after a member of it requests him. Kelvin discovers a room of dead bodies and the planet's powerful relationship with the remaining crew, a skittish, tic-filled technogeek (Jeremy Davies) and a stern, scared-alive captain (Viola Davis).
His first night he is visited by his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone); the planet, it seems, culls memories from its human subjects and presents them, in the flesh, slightly altered. Just how is for you to discover, but those alterations tear the initially grateful Kelvin in two directions. Hashing out those inner demons accounts for much of the picture. ""Solaris"" reveals an intriguing reality about the tenets and boundaries of memory, but it, like the rest of the movie, is an understatement to some mood Soderbergh never plugs us into.
This is not Clooney's finest moment. Best when he's smooth and smirking, Clooney is called upon for anguish for his dead wife, and he can't produce anything more than a lilted voice and painful wincing. McElhone, if mysterious and stunning, is equally cold. Passions lacking, the main thrust of ""Solaris"" is lost, and the blue planet is nothing more than a special f/x outside the window.
The movies erects a giant, pale edifice to art form of passing time, its camera tracking behind Clooney from empty room to empty room, no discernible goal awaiting, in between several long scenes of Davies affecting some mild version of Tourette's syndrome. Viola Davis, for her part, is very good, suggesting a gathering, palpable threat that never comes to head. Soderbergh holds his cards close as if to deliver a late-in-the-game salvo that substantiates the buildup; what he does deliver is an incoherent ""transformation"" sequence that cannot be entirely explained on first viewing. So it never will be.
James Cameron produced the film, which makes sense: No other way is $60 million offered to such a repressed, calculated remake of Russian filmmaker Sergei Tarkovsky's 1972 film, widely hailed as a (very long) classic but no bowl of jelly itself. ""Solaris"" is product of three Hollywood heavyweights with limitless line of credit and artsy romantic leanings, and the end result is an abstract product that will fail the main litmus test for most viewers - is it entertaining? - and for the others who eat this material up, may they paint the town blue.",1065484800,8,3411,5.098389982110913
1882239,4,B00009ATIX,"Luckily not having seen the original Solaris, I could watch this film with an open mind. And two things came immediately to mind: 1) this is NOT as bad as the one-star-review folks have implied and 2) this is a philosophical, contemplative slice of sci-fi/drama - high on substance. I liked it (and I`m quite picky when it comes to sci-fi). The plot - which, has anyone noticed, bears a striking resemblance to the movie Sphere - is basically about relationships reconstructed with the benefit of hindsight.  The pacing is admittedly slow, but it wouldn't really have worked otherwise. You still get sucked in, believe me. George Clooney pulls off the non-hunk role admirably, although personally I would have cast someone a little less well-known. In any event Clooney is upstaged by Natasha McElhone, who is beautiful, strange and frightening and...just amazing. This is a great, lavish work of cinematography. The camera lingers lovingly on the flickering lamps and sterile, minimalistic environments of the spaceship interior (Stanley Kubrick`s influence is unmistakable). To sum up, this is a great sci-fi movie that is more about love than slimy, malevolent beings (your girlfriend will enjoy it as much as you will), and there are plenty of moral and ethical insights that crop along the way, making this hugely enjoyable viewing for amateur philosophers, sci-fi buffs and coffee-table intellectuals alike. I only hope the original matches up to it.",1064966400,2,1456,5.169491525423729
1882245,5,B00009ATIX,"I had seen the Russian version of this film six months ago.  I thought that was a pretty limp film; it certainly didn't live up to the hype it has received on amazon.  Ponderous and enigmatic, the film seemed lost in its own cleverness.
So I was intrigued by the new Soderberg version.  I put it on, knowing something of the story from the Russian film.
I was mezmerized.  This movie - which Soderberg has wanted to direct his whole life - is one of the most daring and cerebral pieces of cinema ever to come out of Hollywood.  It doesn't surprise me that many people don't get it, given the fact they have been numbed by typical movie fare.
The writing is spare - you are given just enough to pull you through.  You are never told exactly what's going on - you have to figure it out for yourself.  But there are plently of clues, if you look for them.
These clues are not in the dialog (though you could find some there).  They are in the photography, set design, acting, score, and especially the editing.
The structure and editing of this film is very unconventional.  Soderberg mixes the past, present, and future in a poetic fashion - the story is not so much about Cloony's character, nor is it about the ""planet"".  It's about how every point in our lives touches every other point, past, present, and future.
There were moments when the hair on the back of my neck stood on end, mostly due to Soderberg's brilliant and daring filmmaking.  The only other film to evoke this kind of a response in me is 2001.
Bravo!",1064361600,8,1520,4.392857142857143
1882246,2,B00009ATIX,"A film by Steven Soderberg
After watching Out of Sight, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, and Ocean's Eleven, I decided that I liked Steven Soderberg.  I'm willing to give him a chance on the less commercial films like The Limey, Solaris, or Full Frontal.  While the trailer suggested that this movie was pretty much just George Clooney in space and something about a dead wife, I trusted the Steven Soderberg name and rented the movie.
That was a mistake.  I like science fiction, and I don't require massive explosions or special effects.  I expected Solaris to be a slow moving science fiction film, I just didn't expect it to be quite this dull and boring.  The premise of the movie is that there is a space station near the planet Solaris doing research on the planet to see if there is any commercial benefit to Earth.  However, there has been no communication with that space station and Chris Kelvin (George Clooney), a psychiatrist, is sent to convince the crew to return.  He finds some dead bodies as well as two freaked out crew members.  During the nighttime, Chris wakes up to find his dead wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone) in his cabin.  The movie deals with Chris still attached to his wife and Rheya trying to remember/figure out if she is, in fact, the real Rheya.
This is a slow moving movie, and I must emphasize how slow the movie is paced.  The plot did not reveal anything about the planet Solaris or the import of what was happening, so I wasn't able to sustain interest in what was going on.  I didn't see that Soderberg was hinting at something larger, but rather that the movie was empty of an actual story that made any sort of sense.  Okay, so Solaris (the planet) is somehow affecting things and creating the deepest desires (??) of the crew, but is it?  How?  For what purpose?  All things that I would expect would be explored to actually tell the story were ignored.  Even expecting a slow paced film, I was let down.  Steven Soderberg is a talented director, and there were individual shots that I liked, but I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.",1064361600,4,2073,4.5896739130434785
1882247,4,B00009ATIX,"In a recent interview, Stanislaw Lem said he was disappointed that Soderbergh's update brought the love story to the forefront. Agreed, but the movie clocks in at half the length of Tarkovsky's, so naturally many of the philosophical threads can't be addressed. Lem, like many other writers in similar situations, needs to stop thinking of his novel as the sacred scripture from which the adapting artist should not deviate. He should understand that hacking a text to pieces, selling it for spare parts, junking what doesn't fit, reassembling it--this is high praise. Soderbergh does a great job with the story, and with the camera (as usual, though he was coming off of ""Full Frontal"" which has my vote for the worst movie of the last 10 or 15 years), and the performances are all fantastic as well. I don't believe there is as much sacrificed in this 90-minute version as Lem would have us believe. It's still a deeply thought-provoking story.",1064275200,,946,4.881987577639752
1882248,2,B00009ATIX,"There are spoilers in this review. This is kindof necessary, I'm afraid, as many of this movie's flaws are there. If for some reason you want to see it, don't read this.
I feel very strongly about Solyaris, Tarkovsky's version made in 1972. I consider it as the best movie I've ever seen. But I went into Solaris with an open mind. Unfortunately, Solaris is definitively an inferior and dumbed-down remake of Solyaris, despite claims to the contrary. The first half of Solaris is basically a fast-forward reworking of the first half of Solyaris. The second half is basically a composite of flashbacks and the new, grating plot that comes to the fore.
There are things that work but they are not part of any coherent context. For example, the relationship between Kelvin and Rheya (Hari in the original) is much more fleshed out. These scenes are real winners, but only highlight one of the main problems of this remake : it is trying to force a love story where none is possible. The whole plot of Kelvin and Rheya/Hari is predicated on the premise that Kelvin does *not* love her, or at least that their relationship is doomed. Otherwise, there would be no point in having Solaris invoke her as a source of guilt for Kelvin in the first place ! That Kelvin and Rheya have such a great relationship, only marred by one clash (due to Rheya's extreme stupidity - I will mention this later), only makes the premise even less likely.
The scene with a dream of Gibarian has perhaps the best original dialogue, but is nonsensical and relates to absolutely nothing. There are nice special effects of the station, the docking sequence, and Solaris itself. While I still think the original Solaris visual is better, the docking sequence is very good, and one thing the original lacked. But once again, they amount to very little and relate to very little.
The blatant racism. Oh dear. I'm sure that organo-centric people will disagree with me, but I consider this version extremely racist and offensive. I know that in Solyaris, Sartorius is also racist, in that he considers the Solaristic constructs as beings to be studied and nothing more. But at least he has a reason : he considers the Solaristic constructs as objects of scientific study, and to do so has decided to ignore their sentience.
Gordon (Sartorius' replacement in this version), on the other hand, has no such motive. She is Pure Evil (tm), the kind of foaming-at-the-mouth racist you only see in movies, and only desires to affirm the superiority of man over the ""inferior"" constructs (indeed, she says as much, which is very disturbing) and leave the station. But she is also a black woman, so I suppose all this must be forgotten. After all, minorities cannot be racist nazis. Right ?
Well, never mind. Even the director and producer are openly racist. As James Cameron says in the commentary, ""when a girl is cute, whether she's made of subatomic particles or whatever, we still want to **** her"", and that the acceptance of the woman by Kelvin is ""a male thing"". In the surprise ending, where we learn Snow is also a Solaristic construct, the two others look at him in disgust, and desire to kill him.
There is also the whole thing about Rheya/Hari. In Solyaris, we are not *told* that Hari is intelligent, we *see* it, and we also see her humanization process. ""Show, not tell"". Rheya in Solaris is *told* to us to be intelligent, but we don't *see* it, and she does not evolve at all. In fact, she is shown to be rather stupid in all instances. She is shown as a theist arguing against evolution, a pregnant woman who gets an abortion because her husband is an atheist (thru the kind of twisted and simplistic reasoning that only a fundamentalist Christian would invoke), and as a floozy who is barely aware of her own existence, basically worshipping the memories she was created from.
The ending is atrocious, creating gratuitous tension instead of exploring Snow's character, losing all surprise and gaining not only a standard Hollywood good ending but also a blatant religious symbolism. At the end, Snow announces that the weapon they have used to destroy the constructs has spent all the station's power, and that Solaris is expanding exponentially. This creates tension as Kelvin and Gordon escape, but the former changes his mind. So we know where he will end up. No suspense. And the end that seems to equate Solaris with God is, I'm afraid, completely confirmed by the director, in the commentary. Ironically, a story which is partly about how humans try futilely to reduce everything to themselves, spawned a movie which reduces the unknown to human myths.
Solaris keeps a relatively slow pacing (compared to Hollywood fare), but it has no brain. It tries to make Lem's story into a love story, when that is a contradiction. Lem's story is the antithesis of a love story. Adding the ideological stupidity of the movie, these are really, really bad cards that even Clooney's great acting, Jeremy Davies' highly enjoyable acting, and the great visuals cannot help. Sure, it's superior to standard Hollywood fare, and has a number of great scenes, but this is a total intellectual dead end.
Kelvin : ""What does Solaris want from us ?""
Gibarian : ""Why do you think it has to want something ?""",1063929600,,5266,4.756284153005464
1882249,4,B00009ATIX,"SPOILER ALERT
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! To me, this was not about love or death, rather it hinted at the posssibilites of future technology and provided just one example of its consequences.
The idea that humans being replicated is not absurd, and its not based on magic or miracles. Whilst cloning is replication through genetic engineering another technology that has recently been in the spotlight is Nanotechnology. As I understand it, nanotechnology is the chemical process of putting atoms side by side to create any object that is desired. Everything that exists is made up of various atoms arranged in unique shapes and structures. With nanotechnology we could change coal to diamond by simply altering the chemcial structure couldn't we? In time, we could replicate anything and anyone. Sub-atomic self replicating robots putting together atoms to create or repair anything that we desire. So is that what Solaris is. An alien life form with the ability of nanotechnology. Maybe the alien life form is those tiny sub atomic robots.
The second concept that the movie plays with is memory. You would be surprised how inaccurate our memory is. How 12 years ago I remember my mate wearing an orange T-shirt to my party but in fact it was red. Our retrieval of information from our memory bank is not perfect. And so Clooney's wife was a product of what he remembered... a suicidal woman. And thats what she kept doing. It is in the end when he realises how wrong his memory had served him... that her suicide was a spontaneous and impulsive act after he had left her. And hence she returns not suicidal in the end.
So in my eyes, those self replicating robots now reached earth ... and who knows what would happen from there.
So.. what is life... just a bunch of atoms in a particular arrangement. Psychological, social and physical existence of a human are just all atoms arranged in a particlular order. (And if you played around with the arrangement you could convert someone into another known arrangement like gold, diamond or dirt.",1063324800,,2049,4.857142857142857
1882250,4,B00009ATIX,"What if you would manage to reach the far edges of the galaxy, and you would not find a lifeless void, or strange cultures, or the perfect predator, or super fast spaceships with laser-guns and warp-drives, or even amiable life forms ready to nurse you into some higher state of consciousness? What if what you would find is a mirror to yourself: the tangible, incarnated moment of your life that was the most affecting of all? It could be anything from heartbreaking tragedy to regretted harmful intent: from your lost wife, to your son who is alive but out of your reach, to even yourself. What if you wake up and it lies right beside you in your bed, unaware of what it is and how it confronts you? What would you do, and how would you handle the confrontation? That is Solaris.
Solaris confronts you with the vanity of supposing you could handle the universe around you, when you cannot handle even yourself. That question is what makes me love this film and the original novel by Stanislaw Lem - though they are not interchangeable.
And that is the foremost reason people do not love this film. Steven Soderbergh's movie takes this very philosophical theme and enhances it, while abandoning the scientific. I will give an example. In the novel, the surface of Solaris is covered by a weird, liquid substance, a little like water but it behaves. It acts as if it lives, but its purposes are utterly beyond comprehension, if there is a purpose at all. In the film, Solaris is a luminescent gas giant, and the crew never once settles down to discuss the scientific aspects of it. In the novel, chapters are dedicated to these matters. This is but one adaptation. Inevitably, it scares off the purists; but ask yourself: does an adaptation inevitably make for a bad film?
I already said I love this film, but how can I - having cared for the novel as much as I do? Well, I care for the film's visual storytelling for instance, and the ""Vangelisesque"" soundtrack, and the sets, and the acting. But when I read the novel, the philosophical theme is above all the most impressive. The screenwriters have taken, added to, and deleted from Lem's original story, but they left this core question intact. Accurately: they have done more than that: they have amplified it. And I feel this question cannot be amplified enough.
For these reasons, I give this film four stars.

The meaning is left purposely obscure, rather esoteric, but the intention seems simply to explore human concepts of life, love and relationship in death and spirituality. Note the flashback where theism and atheism are argued briefly in the restaurant. Plus, the very ""gift"" that Solaris offers seems to be a reflection of reincarnation spirituality, with some minor twists.
  I listened to the Director's Commentary and read the Screenplay, both offered in the ""special features"" section, and discovered that much had been edited out that would have explained more about events in the film. I would encourage anyone to go there for more answers.
  For myself, however, I really enjoyed Solaris. I loved the rich visual color and found the score, coupled with the flashback scenes between Kelvin and Rheya, hypnotic, beautiful; the story absorbing.

1882268,4,B00009ATIX,"First things first; this IS a good movie, assuming that you are a certain kind of viewer. Solaris will be misunderstood and deconstructed as boring, unemotional, and the type of movie only ""pseudo-intellectual"" viewers would like. This is not true. If you like this movie, it does not mean that you are a posturing, wannabe, film critic, it only means that you saw something in it that other viewers did not.
Some might characterize the performances and infrequent dialogue in this film as lacking chemistry or slow, however if you realize that sometimes what is NOT said is as important as what IS said, you should recognize the masterful performances of Clooney and McElhone. The relationship between the two is very powerful and drives a suspensful story that held me in thrall until the credits rolled. Not every movie can make me wait with baited breath.
Some viewers may sense a lack of conflict or not be able to identify a protagonist or antagonist, but this is only because they do not recognize the oldest and most intricate form of conflict. Man vs Self.
Performances aside, this movie deserves a certain modicum of merrit based solely on cinematography and set design. Through the rare understanding that less can be more, Soderbergh creates a very powerful and beautifl movie without being caught in the trappings of its science-fiction setting. If you have a thing for cinematography, check this movie out.
On a final aside, this movie is simply not for everyone, but don't let one person's opinion condemn this movie before you see it. You may find it a VERY enjoyable experience as I did.

1882275,1,B00009ATIX,"""Solaris,"" by Stanislaw Lem, holds a prominant place in the science fiction book catalogue.  It is a deeply moving story of one man's loss and his final confrontation with his inner demons.  It is also a treatise on the nature of how subconscious forces shape and mold ego and how memory and love shape our reality.  And, if that's not enough, it is also a story about the nature of God's relationship with man.  Obviously, translating this book onto the screen is a monumental task, not only because of the comlex themes, but also because of the fundamental lack of physical adventure.  All the action is psychological, if you will.  Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version of this book was overall successful in relaying the comlexities of Lem's ideas, however, it is very slow-paced, long, and, consequently, requires effort on the part of the viewer to stay focused during the movie.  In the recent version of ""Solaris,"" Steven Soderberg, wants to avoid the length and intellectual challenge offered by Tarkovsky and ends up compromising the entire movie.  He assumes that a shorter screenplay and directorial bravado will lure the audience and peak viewer interest in the story.  Thus, he uses his signature editorial style of jump cuts, handheld shots, exquisite cinematography, and, cache actor, George clooney.  He also pared the story down to focus and explore the love story in more detail, leaving the more introspective philosophical themes hidden (perhaps, buried).  While the other themes of the book are there, you have to really tease them out.  The spiritual issues, for example, are abruptly and rather simplistically introduced in the dinner party scene, only to be abandoned in the remaining exposition.  Moreover, we are shown Mr. Clooney's derriere  gratuitously on two occasions, as if to infuse the movie with a dose of sensationalism lest the audience fall asleep.  While, the cinematography is very effective and the sound effects are invloving, the editing becomes tedious and distracts away from the story.  No doubt, this is a challenging project to bring to the big screen, let alone to popular cinema; however, I found the use of such trite pandering patronizing and somewhat insulting.  This story is only cheapened, its themes diluted, by the addition of unnecessary eye candy.  Indeed, this latest version of ""Solaris"" is largely a failure because it is rendered uninteresting and irrelevant precisely by the very strategy used to keep people watching.  All these maneuvers only serve to distract from the story, rather than to tell it.
As for the DVD, I found the interviews totally self-aggrandizing and shameless in their claims of originality.  This movie clearly borrows imagery from great scifi movies, such as 2001 as well as 1972's Solaris.  Nowhere in the interviews is proper credit given to these earlier movies.  It seems from the interviews, that the producers and director of this movie want us to believe it represents a totally original form of scifi movie.  I didn't buy it in the least.

In a sense the concept of pet semetary (yes, cemetary spelled with an s..don't ask me..lol) is conveyed....the bringing back of loved ones lost, no matter the costs...but without gore, zombies or excitement whatso-ever. Maybe Solaris tries to be a love story...but fails to capture your heart like the likes of ""somewhere in time"". The longing is there...but the purpose and script are lacking.

1882297,4,B00009ATIX,"Despite it's criticisms, shortcomings, and comparisons to Andrei Tarkovsky version of the classic sci-fi novel; Steven Soderbergh's flawed, but nevertheless stylish, interpretation of Stanislaw Lem's novel is a feast for the eyes and the mind.  George Clooney plays Chris Kelvin; a psychologist who is sent to a space station orbiting an alien planet to find out what has happened to the crew members of the station, which has since lost contact.  When he arrives, he learns that a crew member has committed suicide, and the two surviving crew (Jeremy Davies and Viola Davis) are experiencing some rather strange phenomina.  Soon enough, Kelvin begins to be visited by the image of his dead wife (Natascha McElhone), and we learn that this mysterious planet can reach into your most painful memories and make them real.  Solaris' problems lie within Soderbergh's screenplay; his subtlety is good to a point, the film implies more than it should explain, and the ending is too happy of an ending and is superbly disappointing.  All that aside however, Solaris is criminally underrated, and despite it's many flaws, it is still an incredible piece of film that outshines many of the over the top glossy Hollywood product that is way too abundant today.  Clooney is surprisingly superb, and McElhone gives the finest performance of her career in a role that many actresses would have a difficult time doing.  Yes it's purposely slow moving.  Yes, it can be confusing.  Yes, maybe it would have been better off in James Cameron's hands.

1882300,1,B00009ATIX,"A film is not boring because of who stars in it who writes it or who directs it. It's not boring because it belongs to a specific genre, is in black and white, old, new, subtitled, or over 3 hours in duration. It's not boring because it's thought provoking or mindless, looks fantastic or has a very low budget. No. For a film to attain 'boring' status it has to somehow manage to possess a very specific and unique combination of properties. To be honest I have so rarely watched a film that I could call boring and entirely without merit that I couldn't even tell you exactly what those properties are. All I can tell you is that when such a film is playing before you, you will gradually become aware of a question emanating up from the deepest depths of your brain. Quietly at first, then louder, and with increasing regularity until you have hit the 40 minute mark and it's screaming at you for action. That question is:
Should I turn the tv off now and rescue the next hour of my life, or will I regret not knowing what happened at the end of the film?
Sometimes you might reach the 40 minute point, ask this question of yourself, and you may opt to stick it out. If that happens then the film has merit - because although it may have it's flaws, it has at least hooked you just enough to not desert it. On the other hand at this particular stage a film might just be so dull, so badly scripted, badly paced, badly exectuted and altogether thoroughly disengaging - that the only course of action is to reach for that remote control before you start chewing the furniture. Ladies and Gentlemen - I give you such a film. Solaris 2002 with George Clooney. An hour and a half of eye-watering tedium. So sluggish and boring that I have even written to the Oxford Engish Dictionary to emplore them to just replace the word 'tedious' with a photo of the DVD cover. so boring that even the current word 'boring' in the english dictionary can't adequatly descrive the effect this film had on me. I really don't care whether Solaris is a planet, a sentient being, a god, or an entirely new plane of existence. I don't even care about the questions the film raises about space, technology, love, or faith. It's bored me so much that I'm too busy questioning my own faith to worry about that of those on the film. After all, how can there really be a God when honest and good people are made to suffer and endure films such as this?
Ok, so it looks nice. There's some spacey bits, a big swirly thing, and some metal corridors and stuff that look all shiny. I like the rain falling on the window too - that happens a couple of times. There's some nice incidental music in there also. So if that sounds like a magical hour and a half for you, you're onto a winner here - more so if you'd like a look at George Clooney's bottom. I've never seen the original (film that is, not bottom..), and unfortunately this version has ensured that I will never see it either which is a shame.",1060732800,10,2971,4.33572710951526
1882301,1,B00009ATIX,"This film is irredeemably bad.  The pacing is ponderous at best, there are numerous large holes in the story, and none of the characters are able to inspire any degree of pathos.  On the positive side, such as it is, the acting is good and the cinematography is beautiful - especially in the way it conveys subtle hints about the story.
What seems to be the main story, the odd phenomenon of people from the crew's memories appearing as visitors on the ship is actually just a frame for the real story, that of Dr. Kelvin's relationship with his wife (who is his visitor) and her eventual suicide.  This story is told through flashbacks and dreams that Kelvin has.  As some folks have pointed out, it can be a bit difficult to piece them together, but there are enough clues there to make it pretty obvious what happened.  What isn't obvious, or even hinted at, is why he would stay with such a basket case.  One is given plenty of time to ponder this question in the almost interminable flashback sequences.  With tighter pacing, this film could have been 15 minutes long.
Most of the holes are in the story that acts as a frame.  Who is Dr. Gordon's visitor, why was Snow's visitor himself, why did Gibarian commit suicide, and so on.
The pseudo-science is also annoying.  By no means do I insist on hard SF realism, but the few scientific details they do throw in are bad enough to make Star Trek look accurate.  The visitors are composed of ""subatomic particles, held in suspension by a Hinks field"".  The solution to getting rid of them is to generate an inverse field.  Somehow, doing so causes the nearby planet to start gaining mass.  Whatever.
Please save yourself from seeing this monumental waste of time.  For those wondering why this is only almost the worst movie ever, it's because it doesn't come close to the level of awfulness of Being Human.",1060646400,4,1860,4.580060422960725
1882302,4,B00009ATIX,"Although far from a perfect film, the American version of Solaris benefits from the brevity (90 minutes)and focus of the story (adapted from both the original novel by Stanislaw Lem and Andrew Tarkovsey's classic 70's film). Solaris appears to divide people just about as evenly as both the first film version did and Kubrick's 2001 when it was first released.
Solaris appears to be alive. The star around which a huge space station orbits intrudes on the occupants' dreams making what they dream a reality. Why? Is there some sinister purpose or is it an attempt to communicate? Perhaps Solaris is nothing more than an idiot savant playing on the imagination of the astronauts trapped on an endless merry-go-round to hell. Or not.
Based on Stanislaw Lem's fascinating novel and echoing the Russian film adaption by the talented Andrei Tarkovsky , Solaris is part dream and reality. George Clooney plays psychologist Chris Kelvin who is sent on a mission to the orbiting space station. His mission is to determine if the astronauts on the Prometheus have gone mad or, perhaps, if some sort of covert attempt at first contact his occurring. When Kelvin arrives he finds one scientist has committed suicide while another has barracaded herself in her room. Clearly something is at work. The only questions are why and what its motivation might possibly be. Kelvin awakens after his first day on the space station and discovers his wife is with him. Which is impossible as she committed suicide.
The film, like its Russian counterpart, is designed to unfold gradually with each layer discovered as you watch. The narrative thread that holds the film together appears to be stretched quite thin by the end of the film. None of the central questions are truly answered. Then again, these very qualities make the film interesting. There aren't supposed to be any definitive answers provided. In many respects, Solaris has more in common with Kubrick's 2001. In the novel by Arthur C. Clarke (like Lem's novel Solaris)there are more answers to the puzzle. Kubrick wanted to keep cold, hard answers to a minimum. That's also the case with Soderbergh's film. We live in a tradional world where we expect all answers to be handed out on a silver platter. Many of the best films play with that convention. If you expect answers to the many layered riddles in this fine film, you'll be sadly disappointed. I do take issue with the interpretation of the ending as a ""happy"" ending; it's no more a happy ending than the perplexing, difficult and complex ending of 2001. In many respects, Kelvin is in as much of a cage as Bowman is in 2001. It's a cage of his own choosing but he has chosen to live in an illusion vs. the real world he left behind. There's a great deal of tragedy to that decision.
Clooney and the rest of the small ensemble cast gives terrific performances. I was pleasantly surprised at Clooney's ability to convey the haunted, hurt quality at the core of Kelvin. Directed and written for the screen by the talented Steven Soderbergh, Solaris, like Tarkovsky 's first adaption, is a quiet, unsettling film that bathes itself in Lem's rich metaphors and analogies. While it lacks the glacial pace of Tarkovsky 's original film, the narrative doesn't occur at a breakneck pace either. Recalling both Kubrick's cold 2001: A Space Odyssey and Truffaut's distant Farenheit 451.
Interestingly, Soderbergh's film has much of the passion missing from these works of the 60's. It's interesting because, despite its snail like pace, the first film was written and directed in reaction to Kubrick's 2001. Tarkovsky hated the the anonymity of Kubrick's characters and the fact that HAL the computer had more passion, more humanity and, ultimately, more flaws than its creators. So while Soderbergh's film references these other films, it also reflects the very qualities missing from Kubrick's clinical 2001.
The DVD transfer is very good. I didn't notice any edge enhancements which have marred many of the films that Fox has put out on DVD. The sound is top notch as well. The extras are sparse; there' the original screenplay available in still mode; an HBO special about the making of the film which is interesting although hardly essential; the films original trailers (both of which are quite vivid and imaginative) and a commentary by Soderbergh that provides an interesting insight into the process of film direction.
Solaris deals many of the same themes as Kubrick, Truffaut and other neophyte science fiction directors; it's ultimately about our humanity and the very qualities that make us unique. It's also about the loss of our emotional self at the hands of technology and personal loss. Soderbergh's film is a complimentary piece to the Tarkovsky masterpiece (which can be admittedly difficult to sit through) from the early 70's. Soderbergh asks many more questions than he answers and that's how it should be in great literature, films and plays. Ultimately, the value of any art form is the not just in the questions it asks but in those it chooses not to answer.",1060560000,,5075,4.929906542056075
1882303,3,B00009ATIX,"Chris Kelvin  (George Clooney) is a psychiatrist who still mourns the suicide of his wife a few years before. He receives a communication from an old friend, Dr. Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), who is doing research on a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Gibarian asks Chris to come to the station to help with an unspecified problem that is affecting its crew.  When Chris arrives at the Solaris station, he finds only two members of the crew left alive, and they are suffering from paranoia , delusions, depression and general mental mayhem. He has a hard time making sense of their explanation of events. When he goes to sleep for the night, Chris dreams of this deceased wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone). When he wakes, he finds Rheya in his bed. This Rheya is a ""visitor"", a being created by Solaris that takes on an identity from the memories of the space station's crew. The three humans must try to agree upon a course of action that will safely return them to Earth.

""Solaris"" is based on the novel of the same name by Polish science fiction author Stanislaw Lem. The film was written for the screen, directed, photographed and edited by Steven Soderbergh. (Soderbergh's cinematography and editing credits are pseudonyms.) The cast is very effective. But Solaris left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. Its resolution is vague. I don't mean that it's ambiguous. I mean it's downright  nebulous. I hope it was clearer in the book, which I have not read. The film also spends a lot of time in dream and flashback sequences, which may wear on some viewers' patience.  ""Solaris"" is a very good-looking film. I like Steve Arnold and Keith Cunningham's art decoration and the images of the planet Solaris are beautiful. I recommend ""Solaris"" to committed science fiction fans and to fans of George Clooney. I'm not sure that there is enough in the film to hold the interest of general movie-goers.",1060560000,2,1905,4.813455657492355
1882304,4,B00009ATIX,"Director Steven Soderbergh insists that ""Solairs"" is another film based on the science fiction novel by the Polish author Stanislaw Lem and not yet another remake of a European film, in this case the 1972 film version of ""Solaris"" by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky.  There is admittedly some truth in this idea since the premises are the same but the focal point of the story and the approach rather different.  Both films share the same flaw in an overwhelming sense of solemnity that becomes oppressive at times, but the premise is so intriguing and the lesson so true to the human condition that such a concern becomes relatively minor.
""Solaris"" is the name of a planet around which a space station is orbiting.  When two astronauts die the survivors send back frantic messages that have mission control worried about their sanity.  So they send psychiatrist Chris Kevlin (George Clooney) to the space station above Solaris and the first night there he wakes up to find his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone) in bed with him.  The catch is that not only did she not come on the trip with him, she had committed suicide on Earth some time before.  Thus both Kelvin and the audience learn the secret of Solaris, a planet that can read the minds of the humans orbiting above and send them people that they have lost in their lives.  Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis) points out the obvious to Kelvin, namely that his ""wife"" is not human.  But confronted with a being that not only is made of flesh and blood but shares his memories, Kelvin cannot help feeling he has been given a second change.  There is another survivor on the space station, Snow (Jeremy Davies), who apparently has had a close encounter of the worst kind with whatever person from his past the planet sent up.
This is a science fiction film where the key elements are not the fantastic planet and the advanced technology but the psychology of the human beings confronted with personal trauma materialized in human form.  The key conflict is between Gordon, who is constantly questioning what Solaris wants and assumes it has to be something bad, and Kelvin, who wants to talk to his dead wife.  While Gordon spins more fanciful visions of the end game of this bizarre scenario, Kelvin comes to terms with this particular Rheya.  She might have been created by Solaris, but she seems to have free will.  However, eventually Kelvin learns the dark true about Rheya.
This is not to suggest that Solaris is a malignant planet, but that the gift it has given to Kelvin has inherent limitations.  The lesson is that the limitations come from Kelvin himself and are peculiar to the human condition.  The maxim that comes to mind is that you are not who you think you are or who your friends think you are; you are who you think your friends think you are.  I have been teaching that in Interpersonal Communication classes for years.  However, I have never seen the principle manifested as dramatically as it is in ""Solaris.""
In many ways ""Solaris"" is a love story, which is fairly rare in science fiction films (diverse examples come to mind such as ""E.T."" and ""My Stepmother is an Alien""), but even as such it is a strongly introspective one.  Kelvin might be responding to his idea of his wife rather than to the actual being, but that is all we poor mortals get to do in the first place.  Clooney's performance is appropriately minimalistic.  His character might be dealing with profound emotions, but he does not get overly emotional, even as his rationality is buffeted by this strange confrontation with a replicant of his wife.
Soderbergh's version of ""Solaris"" is not quite as slow, not to mention not quite as confusing as Tarkovsky's original (which has also been released on DVD as part of the Criterion Collection).  Kevlin and Gordon are able to crystalize the situation throughout their arguments.  Still, even though the point is more clearly made in this 2002 film, there is an inherent power to the original that should be enjoyed.",1060473600,4,4013,4.735632183908046
1882305,4,B00009ATIX,"This is a beautifully shot, marvelously paced film that only Hollywood highrollers can make, not only because the message is ponderous, but somewhat depressing.  As a fan of Tarkovsky's original adaptation of Lem's novel, and as someone who heard from many the Clooney remake/reintepretation was terrible, I was pleasantly surprised: there is *acting* here, pretty good acting considering the hard-to-believe plot (the planet is actually a creature, not a planet), and the story unfolds beautifully with eye-candy shots.  Like Tarkovsky's film, Soderbergh is careful to make this about human being in an inhuman context.  Another great thing about this film is the soundtrack (Martinez always does wonderful work), which accompanies the ""cold"" feel of space with a sense of something hopeful.  This is a filmlover's film, a romance for sci-fi buffs (theres more implied skin than ship here), and has a ""watch late at night"" feel.  If you don't need Random-Things-Blowing-Up, suprise endings, or acid-dripping aliens from Uranus, and if you like paced, contemplative films, you might give it a try.  And if you like the philosophical undertone, check out Tarkovsky's version for something much more plodding (but equally pretty).",1060387200,,1228,5.436842105263158

1882328,5,B00009ATIX,"This 2002 version of SOLARIS is everything the 1972 Russian version wasn't. Indeed, this latest release resonates with me more and more as I dwell upon it.
Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychiatrist going through the daily motions. Then, he receives a video message from his friend Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) beseeching his help out on the space research station circling the planet Solaris. Gibarian doesn't specify the problem, but two astronauts have already perished.
On his arrival at Solaris, Kelvin discovers that Gibarian has since committed suicide. Only the station's commander, Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis), and Snow (Jeremy Davies) remain alive. Gordon is locked in her cabin, reluctant to come out. Snow seems in a world of his own, curiously semi-detached from reality.
Chris is soon confronted with the presence of Visitors, physical manifestations created by the planet Solaris of humans residing within the memories of the space station crew. For example, there's the young ""son"" of Gibarian, and the ""brother"" of Snow. We never learn who Gordon's Visitor is.
Kelvin awakens one day to his own Visitor, his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone), who'd previously committed suicide back on Earth after an acrimonious verbal confrontation with her spouse. Chris, who loved her dearly, has been weighed down with her loss.
The power of the SOLARIS story lies in the concept of a life form created from the another's psyche. As Rheya puts it to Chris, her existence and essence is solely dependent on his memory of her. The viewer watches as Rheya mentally discovers who she is via Kelvin's memories, fed to her (and the viewer) in flashback form by, presumably, the planet's intelligence. Poignantly, Rheya - a tragic figure - is profoundly saddened that all she'll ever be is determined by Kelvin's recollections, that she'll never know the rest of herself. Chris, on the other hand, mired in the twin emotions of guilt and love, clings to his resurrected ""wife"". As he admits to her, ""I don't know anymore if you're truly Rheya; I only see you.""
The 2002 version of this film is, mercifully, 70 minutes shorter than the 169-minute 1972 edition, which dragged on interminably. Plus, the planetary special FX are better, and the interior of the space station doesn't look like something clunky out of the Soviet 50s. Clooney, who delivers one of his best performances, benefits from being familiar to American audiences, something Donatas Banionis in the earlier Russian release wasn't. McElhone, a relatively unknown actress, has a stunning, mature beauty worthy of any man's obsession. Davis is powerful as Dr. Gordon, a realist who knows what must be done if the station's survivors are to live. Davies gives a measured and brilliant performance as the detached Snow, who provides a surprise of his own.
In the mind of every human being resides the memory of another, who was more dear than life itself, who will perhaps occupy his/her dying thoughts. Who would your Visitor be on the Solaris station? The creators of this unique, love story - for that's what it is - have perhaps distilled for the cinema the essence of the original Stanislaw Lem novel into this question.

1882330,3,B00009ATIX,"For sci-fi lovers, this will not make your top 10.  What you get with the DVD is the theatrical version, a couple of standard self-promoting featurettes, an early version of the script and a commetary by Soderbergh and Cameron.  As the commentary states, this is not a remake of the Tarkovsky version, but a new interpretation.
What is clear from the movie and the commentary, is that this film evolved into the ""love story"" theme from the more philosophical basis of Lem's book.  I cannot guess what the reasons for this were, but it shows in the inconsistency of the scenes.  An example is a flashback scene where Kelvin and his friends are discussing God and Kelvin declares that God need not exist. Yet because the nature of Solaris is not discussed in this movie, the content of the scene is irrelevant and is left in presumably as it depicts Rheya in one of her ""moods"".
Continuity problems are evident in the editing.  The scene where Rheya breaks through a door, as in the Tarkovsky version, is removed, but the destroyed door is not edited out of a dream sequence.  The commentary makes light of this, but this hides deeper problems with Soderbergh's script.  We know that Rheya is constructed from Kelvin's thoughts, yet she ""remembers"" her suicide, an event Kelvin did not see.
As another reviewer has said, this film is more style than content.  And style there is, and it is a treat.  The Solaris station/ship is beautifully constructed and the cinematography is excellent.  Clooney does a credible job as the wounded Kelvin, although another actor, such as Douglas might have been more believable.  Jeremy Davies as Snow is wonderfully expressive.
But for me, the movie disappoints.  In 90 minutes, we get a jumble of scenes wrapped into a love story, and a ""happy ending"", yet the real mystery of Solaris is not broached, despite the main characters being scientists.  Imagine the Tarkovsky version with every major philosophical dialogue removed and every scene shortened.  Because of this, Solaris is not science fiction, but rather a redemption movie in sci-fi trappings. Soderbergh and Cameron have proved, like so many others in Hollywood, that making a science fiction movie without a good script, focussing on sets and CG effects to try to please a mass audience, just doesn't really work.
Perhaps Soderbergh could release the ""philosophical"" version he started to make, then perhaps we could see if he had a better vision for the film he claims to have wanted to make.",1060041600,5,2491,4.872037914691943
1882331,3,B00009ATIX,"I think this move had great potential. excellent cinematography, stellar ( no pun intended) performances form the cast. It had a very Kubrick feel to it.
Parts of it had me transfixed, practically hypnotized, while others parts had me hopelessly frustrated.
I agree that this movie is subtle. Sublety can be a great instrument to tell a tale such as this, but this one was a bit too subtle.
My main problem with this film was that considering the scenario: people being visited by dead loved ones on a spaceship in orbit around an anomylous planet. Sounds scary to me.
Unfortunately the movie built almost no suspense around this. I never felt that Chris was the least bit surprised except during thr initial contact with his dead wife. I don't know about you all but I would have been totally freaked. No ownder the rest of the crew went crazy - unfortunately this was never fully explored. lets delve into the mystery a little and build some suspense. Chris seemed to accept his dead wifes reanimation way too easily. I never felt the fear or the uncertainty radiate from Chris.
I don't know, maybe I'm thick, but as hard as I tried I could not connect with the characters. Yes, the acting was all first rate, it is just the script left way too much to the imagination.
I thought this could have been another 2001- A Space Odyssey if only... if only what? I'm not sure, maybe a sense of forboding, of fear of who this ""ghost"" was and what was her purpose.

Star 1-George Clooney & Viola Davis do some impressive work.
Star 2-The cinematography is some of the best of the year.
Star 3-The Score for the film is one of the best of the genre, heavily recalling the polish avant-garde at the most minimal & dense (think Ligeti or Lutoslowski <SP>).
Otherwise, this is a forgettable film which hasn't a soul. It's telling that Tarkovsky's version is 3hrs long and this new one 90min but that the new one FEELS longer than the Tarkovsky version. When all is said and done, a film must be ABOUT something, albeit thematically, emotionally, etc. .  Tarkovsky's 'SOLARIS' was about many things, all handled with the skill of a master who believed in the mental fortitude of his audience.  Soderbergh, however, wants to tease his audience into entering into a labyrinth but then he's not skilled enough to actually say anything once inside.  His approach, as it happens, it quite simple-minded: he positions the failed relationship between Kelvin and Rheya as the the singular issue of existence.  There's some philosophy 101 tossed in for good measure, but mostly, you don't have to think watching this new 'SOLARIS'.  Science-Fiction is a genre of ideas, of complexity, something Soderbergh failed to see.  Sure, points go for trying something serious but really, the scope and density of the subject is just beyond him.  The film tries to attone in it's climax, a climax where the station plunges into the beautiful ocean of Solaris but even here, the filmmaker doesn't trust the intelligence of the viewer and he insults them by having Kelvin reconcile with Rheya after his faux suicide (his reunion after death is Christian romanticism which would've surely offended Lem and which even Tarkovsky at his most sentimental would've never attempted)... It just doesn't work.  Buy the original or read the novel; buy the score to this new 'SOLARIS', otherwise, spend your time elsewhere.",1059955200,3,1948,5.0092879256965945
1882333,2,B00009ATIX,"Tarkovski's version of this film (1979) was a classic.
A skeleton crew of scientists are stuck on a run-down spaceship much too far from home as back on earth the budget-cut Soviet space program considers cancelling the whole mission. Isolated and cut off from normal society and each other, they gradually start to lose their grip on reality, but the researcher sent to make sense of the collapse of the mission realises that the crew's crumbling personalities are not just down to isolation fatigue, and that their hallucinations are rather more substantial than mission control realise. As the planetoid Solaris reacts to their presence, the crew find themselves in a situation that they are not intellectually, ethically or emotionally equipped to deal with. Think of ""Dark Star""'s pessimistic view on life in space combined with ""Alien""'s haunted house reworking and throw in ""Forbidden Planet""'s Id Monster and questions about what really makes a human being, and you'd be somewhere in the vicinity.
Anyway, in the (2002) remake, that's kinda changed. The grubby spaceship where gloomy unshaven crew sat around in dirty vests and drank coffee out of cheap polystyrene cups is now replaced by a clean shiny late-1990's designery aluminium and stainless steel construction, with pretty CGI external views.
That great hauntingly-mournful Bach piece that you couldn't get out of your head in the Tarky version is replaced by a nondescript ""modern"" soundtrack. There are no dirty socks. The frustratingly mist-shrouded custard-surfaced planetoid of the original becomes a pin-sharp purple computer-graphics plasma ball.
The nightmarish scene with the liquid oxygen in the earlier film is very tame here and not very credible ... In the remake the ""liquid oxygen"" seems to be some sort of theatrical blooping green Hollywood goo, and they seem to have forgotten to make it look cold. That really shouldn't have gotten past quality control.
And that incredible mind-blowing final panout in the original is replaced in the remake by the purple fireball fading into the new Solaris logo.
The best they could come up with for the big ending was ""fade to logo""? Doesn't that just make you think ""We didn't know how to end the movie"" ? Hmm.
On the plus side, Clooney does a very good acting job, and manages to ""do"" silent shock and horror very well, while McElroy looks convincingly unreal throughout. Clooney has an awful lot of screentime where all he does is /look/, and he manages to carry it off without any of the normal acting crutches ... no flashy props, conventional action scenes or snappy dialogue in THIS film. Unfortunately, you often get the feeling that the actors are trapped in a limited script ... Viola Davis in particular often gets stranded without a proper line or anything much to work with.
So if you are a Clooney fan, you'll probably love it, and if you have never seen the Andrei Tarkovsky version and want to feel stretched by something that's emphatically not your standard Hollywood scifi film, then you might also think it's great ... but if you liked the Tarkovski version you might feel that the main value of this version is that it shows just how good a job Tarkovski did ... by comparison, this sometimes feels like an experimental student film script being acted out in a very expensive set.
Still, at least they were trying ...",1059868800,5,3361,4.9715808170515094

Clooney should stick with ER or movies with fishing boats in them, because this movie doesn't cut it, or if it does it is cutting cheese.
There is no story to the movie, and the acting is horrible. James Cameron should also stick with movies about boats and let the Sci-Fi movies be directed by people that have seen a good one.

But I'm sorry to disagree with everyone else here but I have tried to watch this movie three separate times and cannot get past the 45 minute point.  It has a very disjointed feel to it, you don't care about any of the charracters because by the time you meet them they already uninteresting.  Hardly anyone speaks and I just cannot stay awake.

This is why I go to the movies, I like to leave a film still wondering about its motives and its message (I also like escapism but in moderation)  It is a very slow paced movie and also an amazingly still piece of work. The drama unfolds in bits and pieces and even in the end you are not sure what to think. Not a very big fan of Clooney. I have to admit he was amazing in this. He reminds me of a  young Cary Grant, truly his gift of acting became clear in this movie. I urge anyone interested in hard core Sci-fi or even the most amazing love story should view this film.

1882339,5,B00009ATIX,"Solaris is NOT your typical science-fiction film. This isn't Star Wars. This is a literary science-fiction movie that only Steven Soderbergh could have created.
Clooney plays a man who enters a ship that had gone astray for quite some time. The first thing he sees upon entering the ship is a puddle of blood, an omen of things to come. He will soon realize that there is something very, very wrong about this ship and its crew.
It seems that the ship has the ability of making you experience some memories of the past you hold dear. In Clooney's case, he becomes haunted by his deceased wife. When she comes back to the ship, without knowing what has happened to her, Clooney's love for the woman resurfaces. Soon, he is trapped in a psychological game of poker, where every single one of this opponents are invisible entities that might or might not want to harm him. What do these ghosts want? What does the ship want?
Don't expect frights. Don't expect intergallactical battles. What you should expect is a taut, psychological experience that will leave you completely breathless. This is the kind of film created to make you think. It is the kind of film that haunts you long after you've finished watching it.
I loved every single minute of Solaris. Not only is the direction strong, but Clooney gives a performance that should have been remembered came Oscar time.

1882340,2,B00009ATIX,"This new Hollywood remake of the classic Russian sci-fi film from 1972 is not nearly as intelligent, nor will it be as lasting. Indeed, this modern ""remake"" will likely be forgotten in a few years, whereas the legendary original will still be respected.
The Clooney remake lacks the philosophical depth of it's predecessor and cheapens it into a sappy love story with New Age trappings and the typical plot-twist at the end. It's formulized whereas the original truly was an original in more ways than one.
It's fun comparing these two films side-by-side. It clearly shows the money-driven ambition of Hollywood today and the dumbing-down of modern cinema. But if you haven't, you MUST see the original Solaris by Tarkovsky! The main difference between these two films is that the original Tarkovsky film is a masterpiece, whereas the Soderberg remake is something to do for two hours.",1059523200,2,885,5.0272108843537415
1882341,4,B00009ATIX,"I personally, enjoyed 'Solaris', for 2 reasons. #1 I think that George Clooney, is the up & coming, in most of his films, #2 the science fiction, that is portrayed on this film, is just enough to capture the attention of the non-science fiction fan, as myself.. It was not a lot of 'over your head' vocabulary, and 'way out' scenes, that took over the purpose of the film.
 Steven Soderbergh did a wonderful job in his direction of the cast, and the filming. The supposed 'nude' scenes were tastfully done, and I felt comfortable taking my two young sons to see it, as well. However, it was somewhat over their heads, as far as, the story line goes. But, the films PG rating was right on!
  If you like movie topics that leave you walking from the theater, scratching your head, and looking for good conversation, then this is the movie for you! Enjoy!",1059350400,,852,4.483870967741935
1882342,5,B00009ATIX,"I haven't seen Tartovsky's version...but i'm definitely gonna see it...have to compare it with this one, because this one is trully a masterpiece.  Like most of the viewers already mentioned, this is not one of those hollywood 'easy watching', 'fast pacing' kind of science fiction movie.  It's very 'European' kind in a sense that it really subtle, moderately slow in tempo.  You need to be very attentive.  If you are in one of those mood where you feel like sleepin, avoid this movie.  But if your are in a fresh state where you feel like watching something that has something more underneath it, well here it is.
The whole mood of the film is very haunting, sad and beautifull.  Beautifull soft colored photography dominate the whole film...it's a very photographic film.  And the colour...i did mention soft colour.  We see many pastel blue abort the ship, soft yellow glow from a room light and a mixture of light soft blue and red for the colour of the surface of Solaris.  It was heigtened with the soundtrack that gives an eerie empty and sad feeling, yet sometimes elevating.  This whole combination, the music, the photography, the colours, create a total solemn, romantic and haunting situation.  There are no blasting situation in the movie...just, thougthfull peacefull situation and feeling.
Soderbergh way of story telling is good if not considered to be complicated...the story move back and forth between flash back and the present situation, whereby the character tries to remember what had happened (especially the character Rhea from the solaris who fought hard to remember who she is, or what she is.  The camera keep moving back and forth between her close up expression or eyes and the event that had happened on Earth).
A very serious movie indeed.  It did not try to be a sci-fi with argumentative prediction on the future...it's more of story where a person is given a chance to heal what he has done, although he may not do it with his real wife.  Just a simple matter of a peacefull feeling, a way to terminate guilty feeling.  This somehow remind me of Vertigo, who have a very close theme, where James Stewart is in love with a woman who bore a strong physical resemblance of her previous loved ones.  Alhtough he realize she is a different woman, he doesn't care, he even asked her to wear the same dress.  True love or just a mere psychotic obsession ?  At the end, is a matter of making a choice to make peace to yourself, hallucinating or not.  So is Solaris...a deep thought full film.  Not as thoughtfull as the original novel from Stanislaw Lem i admit...but still, thoughtfull.

Had I known that I couldn't get a refund after the first 20 mins of the movie start, I would have walked out like a few other people did.  Even after the movie, we weren't the only people to ask for a refund.  All of us were very frustrated that we wasted 2 hours of our time and almost a year later we still talk about getting that 2 hours back!  I thought that perhaps the movie would get better, but it never did. It isn't as if I'm not familar w/abstract-artsy films, but this didn't even accomplish that.  It's as if there are major chuncks left out of the story.  Now I'll have to read the book for some continuity.

1882345,3,B00009ATIX,"A previous reviewer called this film haunting, which I agree with, though I also found it incoherent and pretentious, trying to do daring things with the absence of narrative and sadly failing.
George Clooney does an admirable job in this film, which I saw when it was first released in theaters, and Natasha McElhone and he do a wonderful job developing into a believable, flawed set of lovers onscreen.
Though ""science fiction"" in its essence, Steven Soderbergh's SOLARIS is mostly unconcerned by the fact that it takes place in space. The planet Solaris is a plot device, not a menacing thing, that allows the human drama involving Clooney and his resurrected wife to unfold.
I've not seen the original, and I'm aware that the film is exactly supposed to not completely tie all of its plot elements together. That said, I don't know why they would introduce characters only to abandon them, plot points only to not fully explain them. The ending, though apt and eventually undersandable, seems disturbingly abrupt.
This movie doesn't have the staying power you'd hope it would when you leave the theater. You get the feeling that, instead of answers being there for you to find, there's nothing to figure out, nothing to add. And I found that really disappointing.",1058918400,4,1267,4.925233644859813

7990307,4,B00009ATIX,"Solaris, the movie, directed by Steven Sodenberg and produced by James Cameron in 2002, is about a scientist sent to outer space to recover an abandoned space mission. It seems to me that this mission is supposed to take place on a spaceship, but the elements of virtual reality and artificial reality loom so large, that at times it seems that it all takes place on a planet. I like the caveat that the producer James Cameron states that ""There are some places were man is not ready to go"". It seems he says this because this story digs deep into the consciousness of everyone onboard the
""Solaris"", and uncovers disturbing elements that come to life and become part of the environment of ""Solaris"". Since George Clooney is the primary scientist sent from earth to recover the crew that has been disconnected from the main channels back on earth, it is his love story that dominates the entire movie. George Clooney  is married to Natashya McElinroe, and their love life becomes a living organism inside the space ship ""Solaris"". The Solaris that is either a planet or a space ship begins to generate characters that it pulls from the minds of everyone onboard the ship/planent. According to the director, Steven Sodenberg,
""it knows more about everyone on the ship/planent than they know or are aware of , and the totality of self is projected from their minds, onto the environment. The planet morphs, from a tranquil place of peace, to pure chaos.  While the movie is steeped in technology, this takes a back seat to the love story, as Clooney can not let go of his wife, so much so, her personae takes on a consciousness of it's own and she is the technology and it is her, and it takes over everything and everyone. Where as, the movie, ""The Matrix"" chronicles life inside a simulated environment where life is reduced to energy or , as Morpheus says, a battery, Solaris seems to draw from the minds of the people there. Viola Davis ( Fences, The Help), is a trained Physicist sent to study the environment inside the lab/planent/spaceship. She is there to see if the environment can support life. Cris Kelvin is a psychiatrist, who is sent onboard the solaris to negotiate the safe return (from his wife)  ???of all the scientist . But his wife seems to have merged with the Artificial Intelligience and Viola becomes psychotic, her assistant , the actor, Ulrich Tucker, kills himself, but not before he clones himself( I must buy the book by Stanislaw Lem to understand what that is all about), and the aspect of the little boy Clooney chases around the ship, I hope the book makes that clearer. I thought maybe he is the son they almost had, but either dies, or lost, or is the subject of a fight the two  lovers have, and  Clooney leaves and she is left ( on the space ship/planet/lab??), I do not get that part either.  I did enjoy the movie very much because it  is a science fiction love story, and the technology and all the science wizardry is taken for granted.",1506297600,,2977,4.6056603773584905
