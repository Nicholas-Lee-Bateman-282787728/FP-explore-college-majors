8765405,4,B01HH2QNY0,"I watched the whole series on Netflix so my review is based on that. The first season was the best of the three. It had plausibility and a lot of good stuff without becoming so far out there that it was hard to believe in what I was watching.

I must say the skinny little girl who kind of takes command of a group of amnesiac ruffians was a little hard to swallow, but it is fiction after all.

Some of the martial arts got to me after a while. Just not especially realistic. Way too many times people get hit with blows that would take them down but they just keep coming like nothing happened.

As the series progressed it got less and less plausible but still watchable. Unfortunately interesting characters started getting knocked off in season 2 and it really took away from the show. They added more criminals and it really did not do much for the show.

I also found the concept of evil corporations trying to take over the galaxy a little far fetched. YMMV. But, season 2 was still pretty decent.",1507507200,,1005,4.358288770053476

8765408,2,B01HH2QNY0,"Spoiler alert here, sort of.

Basically, everything you could want to know about this series is available online so I'll keep this brief. Imagine if at the beginning of the second season of Farscape, they had killed John Crichton. That is Dark Matter. The first season was great and, in some very significant ways, similar to one of the best science fiction shows ever made. However, for whatever undisclosed reason, at the beginning of the second season, the producers grew bored with the Crichtonesque character's status as the moral figurehead and general representative of everything that is good and decent in humanity. So, they threw the character away and replaced him with additional criminals which left the show feeling oddly anemic, given so many additional cast members to beef it up. I quite enjoyed the first season and had been looking forward to this second outing for the whole year. It was a waste and I truly wish I hadn't bothered. This sent me back for a rewatch of Farscape, to lose the bad taste, as it were.

Good luck in making your choice.",1487116800,7,1065,4.782608695652174
8765409,5,B01HH2QNY0,"I've become very prejudiced against modern sci fi - for every ""Firefly"", ""Battlestar Galactica remake"" or ""The Expanse"" over the last several decades there have been a hundred thinly veiled fear of foreigners alien invasions, monster horror films set in space (cheap ""Alien"" knockoffs), or science fiction concept shows written by people who don't know the first thing about science or human nature and are trying for some notion of formula involving spaceships, aliens, AI, or exotic technology, missing the true value of a science fiction setting, which is for telling good human stories.  Dark Matter is the good stuff.  It's fresh, smart, edgy, interesting, ambitious, ambiguous, moving, has a real, changing story with real, changing characters.  And at times it's absolutely hilarious (listen to ""3""!).  I was not a fan of the Stargate works, finding them too flawed and/or formulaic one way or another, but whatever Stargate contingent came to work on Dark Matter seems to have learned from the mistakes of the Stargate works.  Dark Matter is the good stuff, and both seasons 1 and 2 have been tons of fun for me and my wife even after 3 times through.  Give it a chance!  But we want a US-compatible blu ray of season 2!  (I have no idea why people think season 2 is not as strong as season 1 - in our opinion it certaintly is.)",1485129600,5,1336,4.778260869565218
8765410,2,B01HH2QNY0,"season 1 was quite strong and I rated it a strong 4.  Strangely for season 2 all the strengths of season 1 were wittingly or unwittingly deleted.  The season starts with 2, 3, and 4 waking up in prison on the moon, separated from the other 4 main characters.  Even though 2 of the missing crew members are the 2 2 loves, neither she nor 3 or 4 even mention them during their time in prison.  Neither expressing curiosity or concern for them, nor making any effort to find them.  Even when conversing with a friend who knows what happened to them, 2 never asks about them.  Not until their (laughably easy) prison escape from the inescapable prison toward the end of episode 2, 3 remarks to 2 that they are leaving people behind, which she brushes off indifferently.  Out of pure coincidence the 3 of them run into 3 of the 4 others who were coincidentally trying to break them out of prison.
As the season goes on 2s mostly consistent indifference to the others and their safety, puts one characters life at risk, contributes to the death of another (later not even concerned enough to find out why he failed to return to the ship).  Most shocking, in a later episode, when evidence is presented suggesting her most trusted confidant on the ship may have been turned against them, 2 indifferently orders the others to kill the accused without confronting them with, or making any effort to verify, the evidence, then verbally ridiculing 5 when she protests this betrayal.  Bizarrely, the show runner in a interview referred to that episode as showcasing 2s strong sense of responsibility and willingness to do anything to protect the others, the exact opposite of what was actually doing in the show.  This lack of awareness of the show by those in charge, may explain why the plots often contradicted previous episodes and strengths on the series.
As the characters previously strong relationships and interactions in most cases seemed to be replaced with apathy.  The previously well integrated plots of season 1 were replaced sloppy writing with glaring internal holes and inconsistencies between episodes (characters forgetting what they saw two episodes earlier, or what they knew how to do several times before.  Characters motivations directly contradicting their previous consistent efforts. Etc.).  Gone were the carefully inserted throw away lines, foreshadowing future plot twists in the series like clues in a mystery novel.  Major mysteries involving the characters were mentioned, but never returned to or resolved.
The season as a whole felt apathetic and wandering, rather than directed or focused.  With the characters betraying one another several times, but generally not seeming to care.  The show lost over a third of its season 1 audience in season two, and though my wife and I loved season one .. we quickly lost all interest in, and barely watched the last eps of, season 2.

Season 1 was a strong 4, season 2 was a weak 2.  Like a bad knock off of season 1.",1483056000,7,2983,4.827111984282908
8765411,5,B01HH2QNY0,"Why are we waiting for Region 1 again..?!?  Have we learned nothing..?!!  Sell your Region 2 DVD sets on the Amazon.uk website, not here.  Okay, impatient rant over..  Really, I love this show.  I love this season a little less than the first season though.
Somebody let a trekkie into the writing room, with their tiresome and overdone ""alternate universe"" plot-twist crap.  Alternate universe story lines are crutches for lazy writers that are tired of their own work and need filler for the rest of the 25 episodes of the season..  It worked for Trek because they can make ""campy"" work for them, and their diehard fans will forgive everything.  Dark Matter however is too, well, dark..  And campy doesn't work very well with dark.  Please, please don't let that little trekkie fellow suggest any more ""alternate time line"" crap.
The Cast still jells well together in season 2 and the plot still moves along at a good pace.  Character development hasn't slowed one bit and the story's environment hasn't suffered any lack of depth at all yet.  Be careful of becoming attached to any particular characters.
So get with it (writers of) Dark Matter..!  Throw out the trekkie writer, with all his alternate time-line crap, and get back to what has worked so well for Dark Matter..!",1481414400,9,1279,4.8119266055045875
