2235913,4,B0007R4TJE,"""Book of Love"" is a moderately engaging tale of the effects of adultery on the three principal characters.

Elaine Walker (played by Frances O'Connor) is a 27-year old event planner who likes her yoga and wants to be child-free for another ten years.  Her husband, David (played by Simon Baker), a history teacher at a girls' school, has slowly been gaining weight and wants a family.  Getting ice cream cones, they are served by Chet, an almost-16-year old high school swimmer working part-time (played by Gregory Smith).  Incidentally Elaine gets a look at Chet's tight abs and is impressed.  Another visit for ice cream leads to a dinner invitation.  Chet hasn't traveled much; so the couple takes him to New York City and promise to take him to Disneyworld.  Elaine shortly gives into Chet's desire, after which Elaine tells her husband.

David, though visibly upset, tries to rise above the situation and says he wants to fulfill his promise for the couple to take Chet to Disneyworld.  Although both Elaine and Chet have deep misgivings, the three fly down to Orlando and check into a motel with pool.  There the anger of David and the wishful thinking of Chet make an appearance, with maybe some other undercurrents.  Seeing this, Elaine freezes up.  The film heads toward its conclusions.

There are two useful subplots, one involving a student with a crush on David and the other with a lesbian couple wanting David to be a sperm donor.  Both subplots give insight on David's character.

None of the three principal characters is forthright in expressing feelings or wants to discuss issues.  The dialogue is directed at surface events and is meant to convey an acceptable social exterior.  This means the viewer has to watch the body language carefully and has to create theories for the motivations of the characters.  There is room for interpretation and for feeling some answers are missing.

All three main actors do a fine job.  Chet and David provide frequent skin scenes.  The story makes sense on an emotional level.

The main annoyance is ongoing conversation and short scenes on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge.  This does not propel the story.  Also, Chet's resolution feels too arty and forced.

Other than the trailer, the DVD extras are especially poor.  Director Alan Brown gives two mini-interviews in which the take-home content is that stuff happens to people beyond their control and that actor Baker gained weight for the role of David and would be taking it off.

A pretty good film, high 3 or low 4.  I gave the 4 because I liked Gregory Smith as Chet.",1115251200,26,2581,4.831050228310502
2235914,4,B0007R4TJE,"If three can play at love, and if that love is an equilateral triangle, then each of the three is equally responsible for the ramifications.  Were that the case in this little low budget Indie film BOOK OF LOVE the story would have more resonance. But art imitates life and life is full of contradictions and double standards and that is what seems to writer/director Alan Brown seems out to show us.

David (Simon Baker) is a popular history teacher in a private girl's school in New Jersey and is blissfully married to Elaine (Frances O'Connor) who is an Events Planner and thrives on her time with her husband, wanting to delay having children for 'at least ten years' in lieu of an exciting marital sex life.  Into this radiantly alive couple's life enters a young fifteen-year-old highschool student and swimmer Chet (Gregory Smith) who happens to meet them in an ice cream parlour and immediately feels a warmth for the two of them.  The feeling is mutual, especially and David and Elaine learn that Chet has no strong family ties, has never even been into Manhattan much less to Disney World, a place Chet covets.

David and Elaine invite Chet into their home and lives, dining with him, taking him to a club in Manhattan (a place where Elaine takes the stage to sing with her lesbian friend entertainer), involving him in talks about Cambodian history and philosophy, etc.  As an aside, their lesbian couple friends approach David to be the sperm donor for a child and Elaine and David agree to their request.  David, Elaine and Chet appear to be a most happy trio until Chet makes physical advances  to Elaine, advances which Elaine initially gently rebuffs but simultaneously feels awakened sensual responses to this young virginal lad.  Chet finds it difficult to separate his love for the couple and his corporeal desires and ultimately Chet and Elaine have a sexual encounter.

Elaine confesses her indiscretion to David, allows him his initial pain, and then is surprised at David's forgiveness and immediate physical response to her.  Chet comes to David's office, apologizes for the event, and David again surprises Chet with his forgiveness and his suggestion that the trio continue with David's promised trip for the three of them to Disney World.

While on the outing to Disney World David invites Chet into the hotel room for a drink and a demonstration of Chet's diving skills, a set up for a physical encounter on the floor.  Elaine enters the room, sees the encounter as a sexual one, frightens Chet who stabs David in a scuffle, and the Disney World trip ends in disaster.  It is the working out of the new twist on the triangle that furnishes the rest of the film and the final results of the trio's relationship is surprising and stretches the limits of credibility.

The problem member of this mnage a trois is Elaine, a woman who allows herself to become sexually involved with Chet, but when she believes David is likewise sexually involved with the lad she is unable to cope.  It seems like the woman of the triangle determines the rules and that is where many will feel this story is more tragic.

O'Connor is a fine English/Australian actress and gives a top-flight performance.  Simon Baker is another Australian (Tasmanian) actor who has a great deal of depth and strong screen presence.  Gregory Smith is a young Canadian actor who shows tremendous promise.  Together the three give fine ensemble acting that makes this unlikely trio credibility and engages our empathy.  There is a lot of talent in this little film and for a first movie writer/director Alan Brown gives notice of a talent to watch.  In time some of the side indulgences included in this film will be less intrusive and more insightfully utilized.  But on the whole this is a successful film worth watching.

2235927,1,B0007R4TJE,"If you like reckless & repugnant pederasts, passive-aggressive phonies or predators dressed up as politically correct do-gooders then this film is for you. Otherwise, skip it. I wish I had. Here -- I'll save you from having to watch it:

A young-ish seemingly cute couple does yoga, travels to impoverished lands, eats hydroponic veggies & hangs out with lesbians in Manhattan. Therefore, Elaine & David think they are ""good"" and ""caring"" and ""intelligent"" people. They think they are really classy, learned and clever. They know things about history and politics and thus, they are quite keen on themselves. They meet a VERY young kid -- only 15 years old. Chet's never been to the big city! Oh no! Travesty! They take it upon themselves to remedy this egregious trauma in Chet's  life and very quickly traumatize him. Elaine, 28 yo, claims to be reaching out to Chet because he's ""practically an orphan"" (with a dead or missing mom and a dad who works a lot.) By her own admission, she KNOWS he's vulnerable -- a lonely, sad and needy kid. She willfully exploits this. From the get-go, her interests are not pure but prurient. She ogles him within moments after meeting him, having gotten him to take his shirt off. She flirts outrageously. The kid is, well, a kid. Hormonal, horny, confused, off-kilter. He's hungry for attention / compassion / kindness. Bullied at school, forlorn at home, Chet's the perfect prey for a predator. He's also quite precocious and eager to seem more grown-up than he is. However, despite his intellect & precocity, he's still a child. Any responsible adult would see that; it's revealed in blinking neon when he confesses a yearning desire to go to Disney World. Instead of being a positive influence in the life of a youth with great potential, Elaine is thinking only of herself. She prattles on about Cambodia, posing as this worldly exotic woman while refilling a 15 yo's wineglass and teasing at his burgeoning sexuality. It's not long before she screws him -- in the middle of the day, on the floor, before the wide-open front door. A telling detail and metaphor for both her uncaring awareness and her blatant recklessness.

When she tells her husband, it's more about show-offery than honesty. Having fed off of this kid, feeling desired and young, she's looking to lord it over her husband. She says, ""Tell me you still love me. Tell me I'm a good person."" That's her #1 concern. The viewer initially feels bad for the husband (as his motives weren't nearly so askew.) When he responds with oddly rough rut-rut sex, we realize David's also pretty despicable and damaged. What Elaine already knows about him and what we learn (other reviewers must be blinded by Simon Baker's pretty face) is that David is frighteningly passive-aggressive. He's perhaps suffering from some kind of mental disturbance, increasingly manic and highly medicated. Though devastated and furious, he books a trip to Disney World. Chet knows better but, being a kid, he wants to believe in this twisted fantasy of family and forgiveness. Elaine obviously knows her husband and is immediately aware that he is ""up to no good."" **Viewers who see this trip as anything other than a sick game of punisher-and-punished are suffering from the same delusions as the teenager.** It's clear from Elaine's response that she knows the game they're playing (and yet she boards the plane and even ogles the kid's crotch on the drive from the airport to the hotel.) At the close of the crotch-ogling scene, David breaks into this creepy smirk-smile. Why? Because he has a plan to torture these two and it's all falling into place. Poolside, Elaine pouts & glares while ogling the kid some more. David seethes while smugly bubbling with veiled hostility and passive-aggression. With a false face of motherly concern, Elaine tells Chet not to let his ears burn. As David applies sunscreen, Chet recoils; David says, ""I won't bite."" Of course, that's more of a threat than a reassurance. In the next scene, he physically attacks the teen in an ape-ish display of power that is deeply disturbing; being both sexual and menacing. One never gets the feeling that David ""desires"" Chet -- only that he desires to hurt him. I was certainly left with the impression that he meant to rape Chet had Elaine not walked in. Elaine seems to suspect something similar (without being too surprised which makes one wonder.) Chet takes the threat so seriously that he stabs David in the thigh and runs away.

After Elaine walks in on the near-rape, David leers and says, ""I guess I should've picked on someone my own size."" This is the key statement of the film. A couple of cowards sought to make themselves feel bigger (younger, sexier, more interesting) by drawing a child into their disfunction. They should've picked on someone their own size! The poor kid is obviously traumatized by the whole sordid interaction and ashamed of his part in it. And YET it shifts from him being in obvious paralyzing pain, perhaps even suicidal, to him traveling to the couple's ""beloved"" Cambodia. Are we really supposed to believe that these people inspired him to travel to foreign lands and become a free spirit? What a load of crap! Meanwhile, David has left his wife and his job as a highschool teacher (yes, that's right, he's a professional in a position of authority who should've known better!) He's apparently lame for life with a bad limp. He had a baby with the lesbians; a subplot that offers a tiny shred of hope to his dismal existence. And the disgusting, selfish, shallow and vain woman who set all this in motion? She's now a yoga teacher with a tank-top that says ""OM."" How enlightened! She ends the movie with an ecstatic happy dance of serene self-satisfaction --- though one gets the impression that her bliss is just another lie she tells herself.

These are hideous people pretending to be decent people who, in their show of faux decency, prey on a truly decent but lost kid; involving him in their sick patterns, bizarre games and sad damage. The only reason I wrote this review is because it boggles my mind that none of the reviews really call BOTH of these people out for the douchebags they are. This is not a story about good people who do bad things. It's about empty people who try to fill their holes by creating enormous holes in the hearts of others. Unfortunately, the director seems to think he was telling the first story (with some talk about bad decisions, no judgement, blah blah.) I would've given it another star or two if I could believe that he made an artistic choice to tell the latter story. Instead, I'm left to wonder if he's as clueless or as careless as his characters.

Update: it's been a while since I watched this. I still feel that the value of the film hinges on the understanding of the people who created it. It's interesting to see a film about truly flawed & hideous people. However, it's touted as a film about good people who do bad things. If only the tagline had been: bad people who think they're good.",1371772800,5,7042,4.758592471358429

2235932,3,B0007R4TJE,"At this point in time, a movie about the effects of a one-night stand between an adult woman and a lonely teenage boy isn't as surprising as it was in Summer of '42, but the difference in this movie is the tragic effect on the life of the husband, well-played by Simon Baker who despite his own great looks and charisma makes us feel for the husband who is about to be left behind. The first sign of trouble perhaps, is the scene where the wife is miffed when the teenage boy thinks she's 2 years older than she is (28). Later, when alcohol starts flowing at the dinner party for three, viewers can guess what's going to happen. The surprise is the husband's reaction which is quite mild. Perhaps this is the other nail in the coffin for the wife who seems furious at the friendship between her two lovers. Her overreaction at the sight of the two ""wrestling"" in the hotel room seems more of an excuse than realistic.

For me, the ending is actually the best part. The melancholy husband seems a bit lost, living in dismal surroundings with no real job--yet there's hope, as he loves and cares for his child. The wife seems perfectly happy with her new superior lover--herself! The boy grows up and has an intriguing encounter with the husband's pet student in Cambodia. The best part for me is the mine explosion! Love and life are not neat stories. Bad stuff happens, often because of our past decisions.

The marriage falls apart and the three go their separate ways. Simon Baker is the husband and no one does heartbreak angst like he does. Just about tears your heart out. He is the only one I had sympathy for. The kid was just a dumb 15-year-old, so you can't expect much judgment from him. The wife was, in my opinion, despicable. All she could worry about was whether her husband still loved her. Not a hint of being sorry for the hurt she caused him. In the end she was the only one who seemed quite happy with how it turned out. Frankly, her husband was well rid of her, although he didn't realize it at the time.",1317168000,,794,4.230263157894737
2235947,4,B0007R4TJE,"I liked this film. Like most indie film it's something different, and, maybe, a little weird, but that does not always mean bad!
On my point of view this story is about two apparently similar persons (the husband and wife) whose view on life is quite different. Both are a little scared of ageing, however David accepts the fact and he's ready to take responsibility. He's an accomplished teacher, who researches for his courses and cares for his students- incidentally, all girls in a private school. At home he has his routines (very well constructed, on my point of view) and is very close to his wife, however he's ready for a change: he wants to have a baby. I think he's meant to be slightly older than his wife, who is 27, and just is not ready to accept responsibilities that come along with adulthood: she wants not to have children for the next 10 years and does everything she can to loose her cute appearance. When she finds out that teen Chet is attracted by her, her 'for ever young feelings' get confirmed and she accepts the boy's attentions, unaware of the pain she's going to cause to both Chet and David. And she tells her husband.
After an initial meltdown David seems to be able to put himself together, to the point that the three of them take a holiday to Disney World, where, however, David finally confronts Chet with the result that life is changed for everyone and for ever.

I loved watching the interaction between husband and wife in the beginning of the film - a couple with obvious passion and fun.  It was difficult to watch it deteriorate which it did too quickly.  It was sad to see people who were so comfortable with each other have nothing to say - I found that a bit too unrealistic for me but, in afterthought, probably pretty realistic for many couples.  The three people don't seem to talk to each other - each in their own painful world, hurt and hurting.

I don't believe in giving blow by blow plot turns and details about a movie I hope you will watch.  Decent movie but disturbing, at least for me.

2235952,3,B0007R4TJE,"I'm always drawn to complicated love, and despite some reviewers' below, the storyline is less plausible than many would say.  It's more of an issue of one bad choice leading to another, then another, even when one is trying to correct the initial mistake with good intent.  The problem is that few of us know ourselves and our suppressed desires very well, even the smarter of us... especially when sex and power are part of the stew.

The film falters most because it only hits highlights of a crisis, and, thus, these come off as seeming artsy or forced, or student-filmish, but still admirable, nonetheless (especially when compared to the crap mainstream Hollywood dispenses every weekend).  For instance, the Cambodian theme never gels into focus; it seems well-intended and pregnant, but never more than that, and when Chet winds up there in the end, it does not ring true.

A lot does ring true, and for this the director and cast should be applauded.  Simon Baker does a good turn at elucidating the ties between his sexuality and his aggression, as felt for both his wife, and the youth; the tussle in the hotel room is as telling for him as it is for the viewer.  I like Frances O'Connor's turn a lot, and found her totally believable until the very end. Her character is probably the most honest in the film, while having made the bigger mistake initially.

A NOTE TO CURRENT FILMMAKERS: please spare us your favorite music supervisor skills! Every frame does not need some rock-pop overly-instructive pap smeared over it. What happened to SCORING????

8050876,3,B0007R4TJE,disappointed in give it a year one character I found unappealing quite a bit the only parts worth watching were with Simon baker some of the other characters were hard to understand and the moving photo album unnecessary. Why it was written in is unclear. Must be British humor we couldn't understand it. Sorry ouch.,1428710400,,316,4.763636363636364
8050877,4,B0007R4TJE,I appreciated the story even though it was terribly sad.  Simon Baker is an excellent actor.  It shows us what the results can be when one makes damaging choices in life.  Sometimes there is just no fixing things even when one wants to badly.,1427932800,,242,4.454545454545454
8050878,4,B0007R4TJE,"It's hard to write about Alan Brown's movies. I've seen them all. Each is different, but somehow the same. This is his first full length feature. Apparently he starts with a basic concept and makes the movies on the fly. With very, very little money. They all have political comment embedded. In this one he takes a couple that have been married just long enough for the initial romance to start to wear off. They still love each other, but are beginning to be a little bored and cast about for diversion. The critical moment is when they stop in at an ice cream bar and meet Chet, the most beautiful, winsome soda jerk in the world. Elaine and David both like him, but Elaine is smitten, and Chet can tell. Elaine and David invite Chet over for dinner, and things quickly spiral out of control.

Without giving away the whole plot, I'll just say that some where near the end Brown loses focus. He is very good at showing complex interpersonal relationships, but here the plot just runs out of steam, and the ending is not only confusing, but completely unsatisfactory. Maybe the money ran out. Maybe he lost motivation. The political content has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. It is a condemnation of the US continued use of land mines and the horrific consequences. It is sort of just tacked on. He does much better with his next films.",1425686400,,1347,4.54320987654321
8050879,1,B0007R4TJE,"This is a movie about vapid and boring people. Long pauses, empty conversation and an awful folk music soundtrack substitute for any real acting or chemistry. Their obsession with Cambodia and its ""beautiful"" people merely indicates their own emptiness as privileged emotional tourists. The truly dramatic piece of dialogue, when the wife would actually tell the husband ""I cheated on you with a 16 year old kid"", is skipped. Then for some reason the ""tortured"" husband decides to take his competitor, the 16 year old kid, to Disneyland? Why? Was he motivated by a forgiving impulse, or did he plan to humiliate and pick a fight with the kid? I thought the fight was accidental, but other reviewers think that was his plan all along.
I was actually hoping the 3 of these folks would have a menage a trois. That might have at least had the appeal of being unusual. But these folks are too cardboard for anything so unconventional. Instead of showing any emotions, all they do is stand around and brood while lame alternative music plays in the background. . We never see what happens to the kid. In fact there is no real resolution at all. The couple does not get back together, the kid fades away, and it all just segues into another burst of angsty folk music. I think this movie must have been written by a 16-year old who is trying to express the futility and meaninglessness of life. Well, he did a good job as far as this movie.",1422144000,,1433,4.57976653696498
