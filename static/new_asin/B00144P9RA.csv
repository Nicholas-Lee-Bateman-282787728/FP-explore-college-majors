3123085,5,B00144P9RA,"I have always loved this series and can never think of it as campy.  There are lighthearted moments, serious moments and the dawn of the science fiction era.  For what it was in the mid-60's, I was compelled to watch it at the tender age of 8.  I simply adored Penny and Will and have become reacquainted with them.  Their allure is still there.

I love this series and would recommend it to anyone who can watch with an open mind.",1210723200,42,431,4.271604938271605

3123090,1,B00144P9RA,"Wow. I cannot believe the positive reviews here. I bought these DVDs as they were released back starting in 2004. Although LOST IS SPACE was a can't-miss show from my teen-aged years, it hasn't held up all that well. So why buy it? It was the first of the Irwin Allen 60s sci-fi classics to be offered on DVD and I wanted to support the effort.

I'd read the reviews that there were problems with the video and a few seconds of material missing here and there, but largely I decided to look past that and buy that first full season. It wasn't cheap either. But I bit the bullet and purchased it. While it was fun to relive that first black & white season (the best of the series, perhaps), I wasn't all that horrified with the video that I'd read about. Back in 2004, we were still watching on a 32"" tube TV and frankly, this didn't look all that bad. The reviews I'd read, it turns out, were written by hobbyists with their giant projection TVs.

Following along, I bought Seasons 2 and 3 in their half season sets as they were released. Again the hobbyists had harsh words, and now, in color, even I could see that the mastering wasn't very good. Later on, with the popularity of giant flat screen TVs, I could even see the bad mastering on the first season.

As it turns out, these DVDs were mastered from the syndication videos that had been done in the 1990s for the series runs on USA network and SciFi. They were good enough for 90s cable TV, but nowhere near good enough for today's equipment. So frankly, I cannot imagine why there are so many glowing reviews - unless these people are just not picky.

But there's good news on the horizon. Efforts were undertaken by Irwin Allen's estate, Kevin Burns, and 20th Century Fox to release LOST IN SPACE on high-definition Blu-rays in the fall of 2015. So you might want to take that into consideration if you're considering buying this series.",1435363200,4,1898,4.429799426934097

3123094,1,B00144P9RA,"If this was Irwin Allens best , I'd hate to see his worst. I hated this show when it was first on in the 60's. I only watched a few episodes.  It makes Star Trek look like ""Gone with the Wind"". Terrible scripts. Terrible props - monsters look like made by a 7 year old.  The thing I hate the most is Dr. Smith. The show played on the Dr. Smith and Robinson's son will. I made the terrible mistake of getting all three seasons.  I shut it off the last time when- once agaiin Dr. Smiths is giving more whining as the show starts. I am reading the Star Trek books ""These Are The Voyages"" They(being Star Trek's writers) keep refering in the book to the poor quality - an unbelieivably bad scripts of Lost In Space. I'm now stuck with two more seasons to try and watch - maybe when I'm having trouble sleeping.",1432512000,,806,4.153846153846154

3123124,5,B00144P9RA,"As to how, why, when and where to buy this TV series, I leave that to you.  You can shop around and will find a good deal as you always do on Amazon when you give it a few minutes.
Lost in Space was not 5 stars as sci-fi(as hard or realistic sci-fi it was pretty weak) but as fantasy, fables and fairy tales, it was priceless.  Most people of a certain age grew up with Lost in Space, the Robinsons, the evil but humorous Dr. Smith, the effervescent robot, Will, Penny, the young couple and of course, all of those special guest 'monsters'.
The basic premise: in the crowded earth of the late 20th century(!?), a spaceship is sent out to Alpha Centauri(they never acknowledge there's no such thing...it's a system of stars, each very different...) with the hope of inhabiting a planet so we can leave the crowded earth.  The notion is silly on its face, as the exorbitant cost of spaceships would never allow for the reduction of a tiny fraction of a percent of the population, but...
Anyway, the ship is being sabotaged by enemy governments(they never say why?  Space race to the stars?) and thus, Dr. Smith is caught on board the ship.  In the early part of the series, he was evil incarnate and the Robinson's were model charity types for keeping him on board. Only later did the 'full' Dr. Smith, a character 100% of the actor's making, emerge.  As he was the star of the show, along with the robot and Will, only the later years did we have the 'Lost in Space' that we remember, in color with humor and fantastic adventure.  The early episodes were more 'sci fi' with little whimsy, mirth, or fantasy.  As the series had one main writer who got burned out at some point(remember the episode of the dangerous plants?  Even the cast were embarassed...), we have an arc, with the series getting better and then bottoming out.
If you wish to glance at your youth, and/or share it with another generation, then get these disks, whether in a set or separately, new or used...",1419811200,,1974,4.476323119777159

Yes, we are more informed about space these days.  But, it is interesting how they perceived it in an era where we were putting man on the moon for the first time.  I still enjoy the episodes, and recommend it for all ages.  However, it is not a competitor for some of the more realistic and action-packed video games of the day.

3123137,5,B00144P9RA,"It has been a lot of fun watching these again. I hadn't seen them since I was a kid watching re-runs in syndication after school.

I'd forgotten how much Jonathan Harris came to dominate the series, and Bill Mumy also. Although Dr Smith was a fun character, sometimes his stupidity was a bit much. And I felt they focused on the son to the exclusion of the other cast members. When there are episodes with the other cast, or the whole group acting together, the episodes are much better written and more imaginative in their plot development.

I also liked the little extras with interviews and ""interstitials"" of memories from the cast.  The behind the scenes info was fun and interesting.",1395273600,3,690,4.68595041322314

3123140,4,B00144P9RA,"I was in junior high when Lost in Space first aired. I loved the first 6 episodes, and really the whole first season. Though it was already turning into the goofy Dr Smith and robot show, there was still a sense of purpose to the characters and the mission. With season 2 it was out the window, and every week it was Smith, Will and the robot, meeting up with outlandish aliens and who cared. I hated the direction, and have never quite forgiven it.
But I did sit through every episode recently out of curiosity. While I still think it lost it's way in more ways than one, I came to absolutely love Jonathan Harris, especially when he's tormenting the robot. Not only are the insults endlessly creative, I found it even funnier when he just casually called him booby or ninny. I found myself waiting for Smith and robot scenes, so I guess they knew what they were doing after all. Still a ridiculous show, but you gotta appreciate laughs where you can find them.",1384214400,,962,4.440677966101695

3123162,5,B00144P9RA,"I was about 10 when this series came out. The first pilot was not accepted by CBS. It was called No Place To Hide, and it introduced you to the Robinsons and the Jupiter III. By the end of the first hour they were marooned on an alien planet. The first pilot is included in the DVD set. Enter Jonathan Harris as Dr Smith, and Robot B-9. The nefarious Dr Smith programs the robot to destroy the Jupiter. (Want your own full size Robot? Check out B-9 creations, they are a mere $24,500.00

Anyway, the new story was named The Reluctant Stowaway, and it was more drama than camp. It gave way to The Derelict, and finally Island In The Sky. After hose three shows there was a lot of silliness mixed in. But I never missed it and I think it's a must see for today's kid. I believe Jonathan Harris recently passed away, he did the voice of an evil Cylon leader in the classic Battlestar Galactica, and Guy Williams who played John Robinson passed away a long time ago.

3123166,5,B00144P9RA,"The 1960's was the best decade for T.V. because of the sheer variety of the types of shows that were on. When it came to science fiction, prolific producer Irwin Allen led the way with four series - VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, LOST IN SPACE, THE TIME TUNNEL, and LAND OF THE GIANTS. All boasted high production values, were extremely successful, and continue to generate fans to this day.

LOST IN SPACE (1965-'68), was the most light hearted of Allen's quartet, and dealt with the adventures of the Robinson family who, because of sabotage to their spaceship on its maiden voyage, are hurled off course into the void of outer space. It started fairly serious in its first black and white season, but changed to pure camp by the second, which employed some of the finest Technicolor photography of any show at the time. As wacky as it sometimes got, LOST IN SPACE always had heart, and many of the episodes - including some of the campier ones - are genuinely poignant. This brand of special charm was something television could pull off at that time due to the abundance of talent, ingenuity, and wit that existed in the medium throughout the 60's.

20th Century Fox's DVD set of all three seasons of LOST IN SPACE is a must own for every lover of classic, T.V. science fiction. The transfers aren't up to the level of Fox's LAND OF THE GIANTS set, but they're still pretty nice, and the color episodes retain their vibrance.

Extras include video and audio interviews with cast members, original episode previews, stills gallery and the unaired pilot, ""No Place To Hide"".

An all-time favorite that I highly recommend.",1327968000,2,1625,4.671328671328672
3123167,4,B00144P9RA,"The DVD set of Lost in Space, which I purchased through Amazon, is excellent.  My primary for purchasing these volumes was to determine what actually happened to the Robinson family after I became too busy in the entertainment business myself to be able to watch it. This was of course long before the days of DVRs or even good home videotape.

Thus far I have watched only the final disk in the series but I must say that I enjoyed it immensely. The show carried me back to the days of super low tech effects like the vegetables with human faces sticking out of the costumes.  I mean even the Gorn of the Star Trek original series was at least an order of magnitude, maybe two better that the LoS animated carrot.

I am not certain that LoS was not supposed to be a Batman type of camp at the outset but nevertheless I found the time spent watching Disk 5 to be very enjoyable.  The quality in my opinion surpassed the original transmission of the program and may even surpass was was seen on the studio monitors as it was produced.  Were there blue or green screens back in the day where chroma tricks could be played? I think probably not which is one of the things that make the creative make-do aspect of the production so ""neat"".

I think that anyone who enjoyed the original shows could do much worse than adding this 5 disk set to their collection.  The price is right.

Oh yeah! Not to throw in a spoiler here, but the preview of the next show following the final show available on the set was fascinating. Let's just say an old buddy of Leslie Neilsen's showed up.  Too bad that Bill Mumy hasn't been able to put a project together to bring a final resolution to the series. He'd need a new cast obviously and poor Jonathan is now one of the dearly departed, but it could still be done.

Break a leg guys.

Even though I'm in my early '50's now, there is no getting tired of this Sci-Fi/Space fantasy. The character interplay and some of the villains they meet are a blast from the past.

Noone could take Guy Williams place but all are great actors. Story lines of Greed, Temtation, Danger an figuring out what their next move will be keeps the interest. I have seen many a show an Film but have never seen a actor quite like Dr. Smith played by Jonathan Harris, you may find other robots but not like the one here in this series not with that personality. Billy Mumy does a fantasic job in this series as Will Robinson he plays his part very well an he with the Robot & Dr. Smith make for many interesting adventures. Now sure the sets will make you smile from time to time, along with the alien props but this is 65-68 TV series for the time it was pretty good, it is a TV series of stories not reality an the viewer should keep that in mind. Refreshing how the Robinson family like some of the other series of the time had major concerns for their fellow man in the right way perferably helping when needed.

3123170,5,B00144P9RA,"This series [TV-Series 1965-1968] is formulated on the old serial cliff-hangers. The stages are cardboard and Styrofoam. The props look like anything lying around in the ware house. From the dialog you would not realize that the actors can and are acting. As the programs progress the stories get weirder to holds your attention. There are also several notable guests including Robbie the Robot that always outsmarts ""The Robot"" (Bob May) The Robot's voice is Dick Tufeld.

We all know the basic story of a saboteur Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) is too smart for his own good and his sabotage backfires from the start throwing the spaceship into who knows where with him trapped inside. What is worse is he never learns from episode to episode. Prof. John Robinson (Guy Williams) is the good guy father that is always giving one hope of being found or getting back. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) is the stereotypical motherly type and is caught occasionally stopping John from beating Zackary's brains out. We have mischievous kids always wandering off to discover the new trouble. And a watered down love interest between daughter Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major Don West (Mark Goddard).

3123172,5,B00144P9RA,"Irwin Allen was known as The Master of Disaster for his movies such as The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno and Earthquake. He was known for some good television series as well. Probably his best, was Lost in Space. The series Lost in Space,was a space age version of The Swiss Family Robinson! The series appealed across all age ranges. During its original casting, Mr. Allen asked NASA for technical advice. He wanted to make the series as realistic as possible. When he did not receive the reviews he was looking for, Mr. Allen changed the premise of the series. During the original casting, the ship was named Gemini 12. When he didn't receive the advice from NASA, the ship's name was changed to Jupiter II, giving the ship its identity. The technical advice Mr. Allen was looking for, came from other sources, especially from Cal Tech. During the original casting, Lost in Space was to be a true adventure series. There was no Robot and no Dr. Smith. The unaired pilot, was not too well received. During its recasting, CBS made the suggestions of including the Robot and the character of Dr. Zachary Smith. During the first season, Lost in Space was true adventure series. The first five episodes during the first season, are classic. During the first season, the Robinson family had to deal with such issues as finding drinkable water, making sure there was sufficient food to sustain them, finding fuel for the Jupiter II and dealing with alien visitors. Everyone who watched the series, wanted to see if the Jupiter II would go into space again. During the second season, the first episode ""Blast Off into Space"" is a classic. The drama of this episode was the break-up of their planet as the Jupiter II was lifting off into space. There were some good episodes during the second season. Some were light hearted. There were a few serious episodes as well. During the third season, the episodes were a mix between being light hearted and serious. There were a few good episodes during the third season. The first was ""A Visit to a Hostile Planet"" when the Jupiter II breaks the time barrier and returns home to 1947 Earth. One of my favorites, was ""Anti-Matter Man"" While Professor Robinson was testing key pieces to the Jupiter II's engines, a portal was opened to the anti-matter world. Anti matter versions of John Robinson & Major Don West were wanting to cross over to the other universe at any cost. The only person who realized the danger of the situation, was Will! His problem was, providing enough information for someone to believe him. The Robot was able to analyze the situation and provide the answers. At the end, the two universes were put back into balance and the portal was closed.
  The argument I have with CBS is, they did not give Irwin Allen the opportunity to bring Lost in Space to a conclusion. If given one or two more seasons, I believe Irwin Allen and his writers, would have brought the Jupiter II, home to Earth.
  Lost in Space was a mix of Sci-Fi, adventure and a little comedy. This added to the appeal of the series. Jonathan Harris was outstanding in the role of Dr. Zachary Smith. During the first season, Dr. Smith was a true villian. If he was not being the villian, Dr. Smith was thorn in his desire in returning to Earth any cost. The other part of Dr. Smith's role everyone looked forward to, was the running dialogue and the insults he would have for the Robot. His confrontations with Professor Robinson or with Major West, added to Dr. Smith's appeal. Billy Mumy was excellent in the role of Will Robinson. One of the finer points of his role, was Will's attachment for the Robot. This attachment first started, when the series first started and would carry through until the series was cancelled. The final member of the cast who appealed to everyone, was Bob May. Bob May was inside the Robot. The actual voice of the Robot, was Dick Teufel, who also served as narrator during the open scenes of each episode. Bob May's & Dick Teufel's names never appeared in the opening or closing credits. Lost in Space appealed across age ranges and was welcome in everyone's home on Wednesday night. The series enjoyed increased popularity during its runs in syndication. Irwin Allen should have been given the opportunity to bring the series to a conclusion.
  Lost in Space is a must for anyone's DVD collection. Lost in Space is a series that can enjoyed by a newer generation of viewers and fans! The series is indeed, Classic Irwin Allen!",1236643200,62,4495,4.6835443037974684
3123173,3,B00144P9RA,"Well it's definately Lost in Space. I was looking for a little nostalgia and this certainly delivers. Almost through all seasons and I'm wondering what really drew me to buy the series. If you really really like LIS then this brings all you were looking for. Just not what I thought it was all about I guess. It was cool when I was 9 and the show just came out so for the period it was created for, pretty cool. I'll be glad when I get through the series and then I'll sell it off or give it as a gift. Maybe I'd watch it in 30yrs from now but not on my best to watch list. Harris did a great job of getting us to hate Dr. Smith as I just can't stand the jerk. I keep hoping that Maj West deep spaces the arrogant idiot but no luck so far.

I just prefer Star Trek much better and it's from the same era. But it does form a background for future Space Sci-Fi. The latest movie does a great job of pulling all the different episodes together.

3357587,1,B00144P9RA,"Wow. I cannot believe the positive reviews here. I bought these DVDs as they were released back starting in 2004. Although LOST IS SPACE was a can't-miss show from my teen-aged years, it hasn't held up all that well. So why buy it? It was the first of the Irwin Allen 60s sci-fi classics to be offered on DVD and I wanted to support the effort.

I'd read the reviews that there were problems with the video and a few seconds of material missing here and there, but largely I decided to look past that and buy that first full season. It wasn't cheap either. But I bit the bullet and purchased it. While it was fun to relive that first black & white season (the best of the series, perhaps), I wasn't all that horrified with the video that I'd read about. Back in 2004, we were still watching on a 32"" tube TV and frankly, this didn't look all that bad. The reviews I'd read, it turns out, were written by hobbyists with their giant projection TVs.

Following along, I bought Seasons 2 and 3 in their half season sets as they were released. Again the hobbyists had harsh words, and now, in color, even I could see that the mastering wasn't very good. Later on, with the popularity of giant flat screen TVs, I could even see the bad mastering on the first season.

As it turns out, these DVDs were mastered from the syndication videos that had been done in the 1990s for the series runs on USA network and SciFi. They were good enough for 90s cable TV, but nowhere near good enough for today's equipment. So frankly, I cannot imagine why there are so many glowing reviews - unless these people are just not picky.

But there's good news on the horizon. Efforts were undertaken by Irwin Allen's estate, Kevin Burns, and 20th Century Fox to release LOST IN SPACE on high-definition Blu-rays in the fall of 2015. So you might want to take that into consideration if you're considering buying this series.",1435363200,4,1898,4.429799426934097

Lost in Space was not 5 stars as sci-fi(as hard or realistic sci-fi it was pretty weak) but as fantasy, fables and fairy tales, it was priceless.  Most people of a certain age grew up with Lost in Space, the Robinsons, the evil but humorous Dr. Smith, the effervescent robot, Will, Penny, the young couple and of course, all of those special guest 'monsters'.
The basic premise: in the crowded earth of the late 20th century(!?), a spaceship is sent out to Alpha Centauri(they never acknowledge there's no such thing...it's a system of stars, each very different...) with the hope of inhabiting a planet so we can leave the crowded earth.  The notion is silly on its face, as the exorbitant cost of spaceships would never allow for the reduction of a tiny fraction of a percent of the population, but...
Anyway, the ship is being sabotaged by enemy governments(they never say why?  Space race to the stars?) and thus, Dr. Smith is caught on board the ship.  In the early part of the series, he was evil incarnate and the Robinson's were model charity types for keeping him on board. Only later did the 'full' Dr. Smith, a character 100% of the actor's making, emerge.  As he was the star of the show, along with the robot and Will, only the later years did we have the 'Lost in Space' that we remember, in color with humor and fantastic adventure.  The early episodes were more 'sci fi' with little whimsy, mirth, or fantasy.  As the series had one main writer who got burned out at some point(remember the episode of the dangerous plants?  Even the cast were embarassed...), we have an arc, with the series getting better and then bottoming out.

I'd forgotten how much Jonathan Harris came to dominate the series, and Bill Mumy also. Although Dr Smith was a fun character, sometimes his stupidity was a bit much. And I felt they focused on the son to the exclusion of the other cast members. When there are episodes with the other cast, or the whole group acting together, the episodes are much better written and more imaginative in their plot development.

I also liked the little extras with interviews and ""interstitials"" of memories from the cast.  The behind the scenes info was fun and interesting.",1395273600,3,690,4.68595041322314

3357637,4,B00144P9RA,"I was in junior high when Lost in Space first aired. I loved the first 6 episodes, and really the whole first season. Though it was already turning into the goofy Dr Smith and robot show, there was still a sense of purpose to the characters and the mission. With season 2 it was out the window, and every week it was Smith, Will and the robot, meeting up with outlandish aliens and who cared. I hated the direction, and have never quite forgiven it.
But I did sit through every episode recently out of curiosity. While I still think it lost it's way in more ways than one, I came to absolutely love Jonathan Harris, especially when he's tormenting the robot. Not only are the insults endlessly creative, I found it even funnier when he just casually called him booby or ninny. I found myself waiting for Smith and robot scenes, so I guess they knew what they were doing after all. Still a ridiculous show, but you gotta appreciate laughs where you can find them.",1384214400,,962,4.440677966101695

3357663,5,B00144P9RA,"The 1960's was the best decade for T.V. because of the sheer variety of the types of shows that were on. When it came to science fiction, prolific producer Irwin Allen led the way with four series - VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, LOST IN SPACE, THE TIME TUNNEL, and LAND OF THE GIANTS. All boasted high production values, were extremely successful, and continue to generate fans to this day.

LOST IN SPACE (1965-'68), was the most light hearted of Allen's quartet, and dealt with the adventures of the Robinson family who, because of sabotage to their spaceship on its maiden voyage, are hurled off course into the void of outer space. It started fairly serious in its first black and white season, but changed to pure camp by the second, which employed some of the finest Technicolor photography of any show at the time. As wacky as it sometimes got, LOST IN SPACE always had heart, and many of the episodes - including some of the campier ones - are genuinely poignant. This brand of special charm was something television could pull off at that time due to the abundance of talent, ingenuity, and wit that existed in the medium throughout the 60's.

20th Century Fox's DVD set of all three seasons of LOST IN SPACE is a must own for every lover of classic, T.V. science fiction. The transfers aren't up to the level of Fox's LAND OF THE GIANTS set, but they're still pretty nice, and the color episodes retain their vibrance.

Extras include video and audio interviews with cast members, original episode previews, stills gallery and the unaired pilot, ""No Place To Hide"".

An all-time favorite that I highly recommend.",1327968000,2,1625,4.671328671328672
3357664,4,B00144P9RA,"The DVD set of Lost in Space, which I purchased through Amazon, is excellent.  My primary for purchasing these volumes was to determine what actually happened to the Robinson family after I became too busy in the entertainment business myself to be able to watch it. This was of course long before the days of DVRs or even good home videotape.

Thus far I have watched only the final disk in the series but I must say that I enjoyed it immensely. The show carried me back to the days of super low tech effects like the vegetables with human faces sticking out of the costumes.  I mean even the Gorn of the Star Trek original series was at least an order of magnitude, maybe two better that the LoS animated carrot.

I am not certain that LoS was not supposed to be a Batman type of camp at the outset but nevertheless I found the time spent watching Disk 5 to be very enjoyable.  The quality in my opinion surpassed the original transmission of the program and may even surpass was was seen on the studio monitors as it was produced.  Were there blue or green screens back in the day where chroma tricks could be played? I think probably not which is one of the things that make the creative make-do aspect of the production so ""neat"".

I think that anyone who enjoyed the original shows could do much worse than adding this 5 disk set to their collection.  The price is right.

Oh yeah! Not to throw in a spoiler here, but the preview of the next show following the final show available on the set was fascinating. Let's just say an old buddy of Leslie Neilsen's showed up.  Too bad that Bill Mumy hasn't been able to put a project together to bring a final resolution to the series. He'd need a new cast obviously and poor Jonathan is now one of the dearly departed, but it could still be done.

Billy Mumy does a fantasic job in this series as Will Robinson he plays his part very well an he with the Robot & Dr. Smith make for many interesting adventures. Now sure the sets will make you smile from time to time, along with the alien props but this is 65-68 TV series for the time it was pretty good, it is a TV series of stories not reality an the viewer should keep that in mind. Refreshing how the Robinson family like some of the other series of the time had major concerns for their fellow man in the right way perferably helping when needed.

3357667,5,B00144P9RA,"This series [TV-Series 1965-1968] is formulated on the old serial cliff-hangers. The stages are cardboard and Styrofoam. The props look like anything lying around in the ware house. From the dialog you would not realize that the actors can and are acting. As the programs progress the stories get weirder to holds your attention. There are also several notable guests including Robbie the Robot that always outsmarts ""The Robot"" (Bob May) The Robot's voice is Dick Tufeld.

We all know the basic story of a saboteur Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) is too smart for his own good and his sabotage backfires from the start throwing the spaceship into who knows where with him trapped inside. What is worse is he never learns from episode to episode. Prof. John Robinson (Guy Williams) is the good guy father that is always giving one hope of being found or getting back. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) is the stereotypical motherly type and is caught occasionally stopping John from beating Zackary's brains out. We have mischievous kids always wandering off to discover the new trouble. And a watered down love interest between daughter Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major Don West (Mark Goddard).

3357669,5,B00144P9RA,"Irwin Allen was known as The Master of Disaster for his movies such as The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno and Earthquake. He was known for some good television series as well. Probably his best, was Lost in Space. The series Lost in Space,was a space age version of The Swiss Family Robinson! The series appealed across all age ranges. During its original casting, Mr. Allen asked NASA for technical advice. He wanted to make the series as realistic as possible. When he did not receive the reviews he was looking for, Mr. Allen changed the premise of the series. During the original casting, the ship was named Gemini 12. When he didn't receive the advice from NASA, the ship's name was changed to Jupiter II, giving the ship its identity. The technical advice Mr. Allen was looking for, came from other sources, especially from Cal Tech. During the original casting, Lost in Space was to be a true adventure series. There was no Robot and no Dr. Smith. The unaired pilot, was not too well received. During its recasting, CBS made the suggestions of including the Robot and the character of Dr. Zachary Smith. During the first season, Lost in Space was true adventure series. The first five episodes during the first season, are classic. During the first season, the Robinson family had to deal with such issues as finding drinkable water, making sure there was sufficient food to sustain them, finding fuel for the Jupiter II and dealing with alien visitors. Everyone who watched the series, wanted to see if the Jupiter II would go into space again. During the second season, the first episode ""Blast Off into Space"" is a classic. The drama of this episode was the break-up of their planet as the Jupiter II was lifting off into space. There were some good episodes during the second season. Some were light hearted. There were a few serious episodes as well. During the third season, the episodes were a mix between being light hearted and serious. There were a few good episodes during the third season. The first was ""A Visit to a Hostile Planet"" when the Jupiter II breaks the time barrier and returns home to 1947 Earth. One of my favorites, was ""Anti-Matter Man"" While Professor Robinson was testing key pieces to the Jupiter II's engines, a portal was opened to the anti-matter world. Anti matter versions of John Robinson & Major Don West were wanting to cross over to the other universe at any cost. The only person who realized the danger of the situation, was Will! His problem was, providing enough information for someone to believe him. The Robot was able to analyze the situation and provide the answers. At the end, the two universes were put back into balance and the portal was closed.
  The argument I have with CBS is, they did not give Irwin Allen the opportunity to bring Lost in Space to a conclusion. If given one or two more seasons, I believe Irwin Allen and his writers, would have brought the Jupiter II, home to Earth.
  Lost in Space was a mix of Sci-Fi, adventure and a little comedy. This added to the appeal of the series. Jonathan Harris was outstanding in the role of Dr. Zachary Smith. During the first season, Dr. Smith was a true villian. If he was not being the villian, Dr. Smith was thorn in his desire in returning to Earth any cost. The other part of Dr. Smith's role everyone looked forward to, was the running dialogue and the insults he would have for the Robot. His confrontations with Professor Robinson or with Major West, added to Dr. Smith's appeal. Billy Mumy was excellent in the role of Will Robinson. One of the finer points of his role, was Will's attachment for the Robot. This attachment first started, when the series first started and would carry through until the series was cancelled. The final member of the cast who appealed to everyone, was Bob May. Bob May was inside the Robot. The actual voice of the Robot, was Dick Teufel, who also served as narrator during the open scenes of each episode. Bob May's & Dick Teufel's names never appeared in the opening or closing credits. Lost in Space appealed across age ranges and was welcome in everyone's home on Wednesday night. The series enjoyed increased popularity during its runs in syndication. Irwin Allen should have been given the opportunity to bring the series to a conclusion.
  Lost in Space is a must for anyone's DVD collection. Lost in Space is a series that can enjoyed by a newer generation of viewers and fans! The series is indeed, Classic Irwin Allen!",1236643200,62,4495,4.6835443037974684
3357670,3,B00144P9RA,"Well it's definately Lost in Space. I was looking for a little nostalgia and this certainly delivers. Almost through all seasons and I'm wondering what really drew me to buy the series. If you really really like LIS then this brings all you were looking for. Just not what I thought it was all about I guess. It was cool when I was 9 and the show just came out so for the period it was created for, pretty cool. I'll be glad when I get through the series and then I'll sell it off or give it as a gift. Maybe I'd watch it in 30yrs from now but not on my best to watch list. Harris did a great job of getting us to hate Dr. Smith as I just can't stand the jerk. I keep hoping that Maj West deep spaces the arrogant idiot but no luck so far.

I just prefer Star Trek much better and it's from the same era. But it does form a background for future Space Sci-Fi. The latest movie does a great job of pulling all the different episodes together.

Good but I wouldn't recommend to serious tech type sci-fi fans. Think I've just gotten used to modern Sci-Fi is all.",1231545600,7,1059,4.038095238095238

3357674,5,B00144P9RA,"Great job Fox! for not being Digitally Remastered etc, the picture&sound is outstanding!! well worth the $112 I paid for to be sure. watch it through special prosessors like a DVD player/recorder 1080P & run the audio through a simulated 5.1 Dolby descrete audio system etc its even better! sure beats the VHS, with the orig full frame!!!",1219622400,15,338,4.844827586206897
3357675,5,B00144P9RA,Growing up watching these shows when they were new was excted and with the series on dvd you can catch that same excitment again. The main thing I likew about LOST IN SPACE on dvd is the two pilot shows  its strang seeing the first one without the robit and DR. SMITH.For those who grew up in the 60s watching these great shows this dvd set is for you.,1219363200,3,352,4.101449275362318

3357677,5,B00144P9RA,"I'm 50 years old and was less than 10 when this show first aired back in the 60's.  I grew up loving Science Fiction and have watched many of the series and movies.  Lost in Space was one of the first series I watched.  The special effects where great for the time but low by todays standards,  but this is a 1960s era show.  the first epasodes, are of course, in black and white, and that is ok too.  I didn't buy the series to pick it apart, I bought it to relive the adventure.  So if your quite a bit younger than me and expecting great special effects, forget it.  enjoy the story line, and the way movies used to be made.  It's just like I remember it, and I highly recommend this product.  The concept of taking TV series and turning them into DVDs is a wonderful idea.  Now when is the 4th season of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea going to be reliesed?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voyage-to-the-Bottom-of-the-Sea-Seasons-1-3/dp/B000VXKLO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea - Seasons 1 - 3</a>

3357679,5,B00144P9RA,"This series was extremely campy and illogical scientifically, but was never the less extremely intertaining in a mindless sort of way.  I mean really, how many times will the Robinsons' put up with Dr. Smith without throwing him out into the cold black abyss of outer space.  If nothing else the banter between Dr. Smith and the Robot is worth it all.  I saw a website dedicated to listing all the different names that Dr. Smith levied on the Robot over the years.  It is immense.",1215820800,2,480,4.546511627906977

8254424,5,B00144P9RA,"Space rocks!  I grew up with Space and I love it this day. I feel young again when I watch these and I watch them over and over during my grown-up years.  The ""Bot"" and Dr. Smith are a scream and Penny and Judy are hot.  The color episodes have awesome goofy stage sets and are so vivid and just fun as hell.  John Williams did a lot of the music and it is exceptional.  My mother loved the show and considered Dr. Smith an excellent vocabulary builder for us at such a young age.
