8322517,1,B001MYIQ2W,"Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. First of all, the budget must have been nonexistent.  The movie looks like it was filmed under a 25 watt bulb. The dialogue makes little sense and acting is below grammar school level. You have to wonder what the pitch meeting was like. Is Ben Vereen so far down on his luck to be reduced to this drivel?",1401148800,,345,4.3076923076923075
8322518,5,B001MYIQ2W,"Chalk it up with Blues Brothers, Bad Boys (Sean Penn), Thief (Jame Caan), The Hunter (Steve McQueen), as a soon-to-be a Chicago classic.  Has spiritual dimension like Blues Brothers but without getting too serious and maintaining comedic yet touching theme.",1365811200,,257,5.425
8322519,5,B001MYIQ2W,"This very cool little movie stars Ben Vereen and some of the best actors ever to come out of Second City, including Tim Kazurinsky, Greg Hollimon, and David Pasquesi. For those of us looking into the abyss of this financial crisis this film gets down to what it's really all about. It's funny, quirky, and lays out a great message of social justice. You will love it! The musical score is way cool too!",1238112000,,402,4.445945945945946
8322520,2,B001MYIQ2W,"Ben Vereen partially leads this tale of hitting the skids and trying to find enlightenment on the streets of Chicago.

A fired used car salesman, played by Mike Houlihan (also the freshman writer of this film) is subjected to the whims of a Chicago street resident, played convincingly by Vereen, who also happens to be working for God, at least I think that is what they were trying to do here. The story follows our character through the coarse of becoming homeless and begging on the streets, all whilst trying to be taught how to be a better person.

The camera work is competently done throughout the various angles and street footage, but it doesn't showcase as much of Chicago like I had hoped. Ben Vereen has 20 minutes of screen time, and if anything the film showcases a little of the tough life on the Chicago streets, but not in an advocacy kind of way. The main character is so irritating and mean that any change seems impossible, even though this is supposed to be about learning to change one's life.

The music reminded me a bit of Barney Miller, it even had the look of it at times, and by the time that horribly inane ""tapioca"" ending arrives I was very thankful. Not sure who to recommend this bare bones DVD to (as the only addition to it of the 3 deleted scenes are just as painful), but maybe it will find a niche.",1237680000,,1337,4.426829268292683
