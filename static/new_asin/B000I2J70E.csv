8143300,3,B000I2J70E,"Is this film a dramatization of a true story or a random love story? Is it about corporate greed or about a love triangle? It is hard to tell what is the plot and what is the subplot. The story of corporate greed is often played out in dramatic ways with big bad evil companies coming with mean murderous characters who show up and attempt to take over the little people and destroy all that is good with the world. This film doesn't really offer much more complexity on the story line from that perspective of the big bad corporate devils but at least attempts to show the struggle of one man wavering convictions; the question on whether it would be good for him personally and his community. The film has some good points.  The exotic part of the film is that it uses a specific Costan Rican struggle ,to protect its virgin coasts and plantations. However, the love triangle seems forced into the story line and transitions are awkward. The film tries to be two things and partially fails at both, unlike like the protagonist in the story who completely fails in all ways.",1494806400,,1075,4.512820512820513
8143301,2,B000I2J70E,"I teach a high school Hispanic culture class and decided to try this movie out for my unit on agriculture (bananas) in Costa Rica. The truth is, the movie has more to do with oil and corporate greed; it merely takes place to the backdrop of a banana plantation. The film is, at its core, a dramatic love triangle story. Vicente is torn between his love for Irene and Abigail and he acts like many men would: clueless and obstinate. I had to screen this film for content, and if anyone is considering showing it to grade school students, you will have 3 or 4 intense sexual scenes to cut through. In the end, I found the movie less a cultural drama than a soap opera.",1445904000,,666,4.2936507936507935

8143304,4,B000I2J70E,"Vicente (Jorge Perrugorria) and Abigal (Cuca Escribano) are a young couple seeking to build a life for themselves as bannana farmers in Costa Rica. But events conspire to turn their world upside down. First Abigal's long lost half-sister, Irene (Maya Zapata), shows up and begins to stay with them. Then Vicente becomes involved in a local protest movement to prevent an American oil company from exploiting the area's oil resources.

Irene and Vincente become lovers. Meanwhile, Vicente betrays his fellow protestors by switching sides in exchange for a tidy sum of money from the oil company. In the end, Vincente tries to do the right thing. But by then it is too late and tragedy follows.

This movie lacks subtly and it is pretty obvious what is going to happen from an early stage. But the dual plot lines keep the story moving and were enough to hold my interest. The cinematography is gorgeous and a great tourism promotion for the Carribean side of Costa Rica. But the acting, direction and other aspects of the movie are all a little below top notch. It's kind of like a Latin tele-novella striving for a grand artistic accomplishment and not quite making it. But still it's an interesting film that poses some intriguing moral questions. I consider it one worth watching.",1222214400,4,1282,4.8493150684931505
