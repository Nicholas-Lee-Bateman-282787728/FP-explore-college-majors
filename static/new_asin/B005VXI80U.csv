8487712,3,B005VXI80U,"Like many European 3D films, this was released in 3D only in Europe (region B) and you must have a multistandard (e.g., Orei) or European 3D blueray player or a pc with 3d blu ray ability to watch it in 3D. Release date 2011.  3D is not bad but not the best either.  Language only in Italian with English subtitles. A series of fairly well done parodies on 3D and 2D films with about 15 minutes each for Avatar, Harry Potter, Friday 13th, The Godfather, Fast and Furious etc.  Some of the gags are funny but we found most others just dumb.  Swearing and sex jokes.",1472688000,2,564,4.2924528301886795
