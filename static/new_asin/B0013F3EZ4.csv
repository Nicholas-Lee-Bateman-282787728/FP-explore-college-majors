8250538,5,B0013F3EZ4,This a very simple to follow well laid out and informative video! I rented it from the library and then had to have it! I have tried many different homemade pizza dough recipes and this is our go to recipe! The kids love it and say that it tastes as good as if not better that Pizza Hut!,1423094400,,287,3.9655172413793105
