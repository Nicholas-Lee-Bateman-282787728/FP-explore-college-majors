Watching these gave me a different feel of the combat experience the US infantry & armour units faced in France. It is rather scary to watch knowing they were facing so much more danger & death much more than the modern warfare US troops see now.

You see a lot of German prisoners though there is not that much shooting going on the troops are usually moving up to engage however you can tell the action is not far away and they will soon be facing it. Some US artillery action too. You can see free short sample clips of the whole video series  on the web.",1306627200,,685,4.2615384615384615
