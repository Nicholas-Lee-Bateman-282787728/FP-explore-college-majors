8463801,4,B005B0QYPO,"This film by Sean Baker pre-dates his better known ""Tangerine"" and ""Starlet"", but shares many of those films' considerable strengths. Baker finds a way to make films about those on the very edge of society  transsexual hookers in ""Tangerine"", a druggy porn star in ""Starlet"", hustlers selling counterfeit bags and clothing on the streets of New York here, and present their lives with compassion, empathy and  surprisingly  tremendous amounts of humor.

Baker neither judges nor condescends. These are flawed and screwed up people  like all of us  and they have great qualities, like strength, resilience and smarts like all of us too. And for all the laughs he finds in their idiosyncratic worlds and situations, it never feels like he's laughing AT these struggling folks on the margins. Baker just sees that life can be funny and people can be funny  even when circumstances are tough.

As always he gets terrific performances from a mix of pros and non-actors, who also collaborated on the dialogue (in some ways Baker seems a bit of an American Mike Leigh).

For 'Prince of Broadway' the basic plot is be a bit more familiar and predictable than some of his films: An old girl friend shows up at struggling illegal black immigrant Lucky's door and drops off a 2 year old boy, claiming that Lucky is the father, and that she'll be back in 2 weeks to get him back. It's not much of a spoiler to say the kid stays longer than 2 weeks, and despite all Lucky's efforts to the contrary, he starts to bond with the boy who may or may not be his son.

But the plot here is secondary to the wonderful moment by moment human interactions. Prince Adu is terrific as Lucky. A big, tough looking guy with a terribly soft heart, Lucky is prone to freak outs and weeping as he realizes how in over his head he is in dealing with this child -- and with life in general. His best friend is his boss Levon, a white Armenian guy who runs a shop selling counterfeit and/or stolen merchandise, but who seems to genuinely care for Lucky and his fellow workers, as well as his regular customers  and who is struggling through his own painfully rocky marriage. These three form the center of the story, and a number of very well drawn supporting characters spiral off from there.

The film looks like it was made for about $25, and the end credits show the crew to be tiny, but Baker is expert at making the low-budget rough edges of his films work in their favor, using the low tech filming style to feed a sense of near documentary honesty  without falling into the now common trap of trying to make it feel literally like a documentary. The film may be messy and loose, but it's also clear Baker is thinking about where his camera goes and about telling a story visually as well as through great performances and terrific writing.

With each film by Baker I see I like him and his body of work more. Here's a guy who wants to tell the stories of the people that Hollywood and TV ignores, and does it with tons of heart, humor and smarts. Whatever minor flaws it might have, it's very much worth seeing.",1495065600,2,3086,4.507168458781362
8463802,5,B005B0QYPO,Original and unique take on the American Dream.  It's an inspiring look into the underground economy of knock offs.  Who benefits and who's collateral damage in the great scheme of immigration issues in our society.  It's a personal story of individuals caught up in a world that most of us ignore.  It's a story of one individual finding his strengths and growing up.,1423353600,,368,4.7936507936507935

8463804,5,B005B0QYPO,"Sean Baker has now given us two exceptional films.  This and ""Take Out"" both were done on the cheap, with minimal equipment, unknown actors, and filmed on location. Bare bones movie making. And both efforts are better than any billion dollar budget Harrison Ford dreck. Baker is a one man band, director, cinematographer, writer...he probably provides the catering for his productions too.  ""Prince of Broadway"" is largely non-scripted. He lets his actors interpret their roles and improvise their own dialogue. While this is usually a recipe for disaster, it's a brilliant and gutsy move in this case. His cast has the street creds to get it right and turn their characters into real people with a grace and ease that has us hooked from the gitgo.

""Prince of Broadway"" is the story of Lucky, a street hustler who fronts for a knock off shop...a store with a back room where you can find Made in Korea  copies of your favorite designer gear, pick up a fairly believable Fendi purse or pair of damn-near Nike Kobe 8s for twenty bucks.  Lucky is played by Prince Abu, who gives the character a freshness, authenticity and warmth that most mainstream actors would be hard-pressed to match. And don't forget, he's ad libbing his dialogue much of the time as well.

As in ""Take Out,"" the primary character's life is going along fine...like most of us, just living that day to day grind with a little fun where and when we can find it. Until somebody puts a stick in our spokes. In this case, the stick is a 3 year old kid.  Lucky's life gets a big dose of complication when an old girlfriend shows up and drops off what she claims is his son.  She has a new boyfriend and the kid is holding her back, so it's Daddy's turn at bat she says and walks away. Lucky now becomes a street hustler pushing a stroller, and no one wants to help.  His girlfriend is not interested in being a second-hand baby mama, and Lucky's boss, Levon, has his own problems. Of unnamed Middle Eastern descent, he's harrassed by post 9-11 zealots (there's a ""Report Suspicious Activities"" poster hanging in his shop) and New York's Finest Knock Off Squad--the Intellectual Property Police, while watching his marriage go down the tubes. Levon is played by Karren Karagulian who transforms what could have been  a stereotype retread into a real, flesh and blood person.

Gritty but never grim, intermittently funny, a little bit sad, warm without ever being sappy, and always, always strong and believable, Prince of the City is another one of Sean Baker's quirky looks into somebody's life, one of those somebodies who live on our fringes, the background people we see but never notice.  Baker is a gem. He deserves recognition and accolades and should be declared a National Treasure.  I hope we see more of him on this small, intimate level. I hope the world but not Hollywood finds him. I hope he never casts Matt Dillon in a movie.

Watch Prince of Broadway. It's really good. Five easy stars.",1384387200,3,2967,4.680769230769231
8463805,3,B005B0QYPO,"Unwanted baby, lovers, and immigrants are all ""livin' just enough for the cit-ay."" Tiny budget indies are important for subjects like this, but the sloppy production is almost unbearable.  Actors are rarely more than 4 feet from the camera.  Shots are rarely more than seconds.  The lack of a tripod makes the shaky cam fast edits (with the cheapest lens possible) nauseating.  Still, I must admit the lead and child actors have a very raw chemistry that experienced actors rarely if ever have.",1366329600,,494,4.9156626506024095
8463806,5,B005B0QYPO,"Me and my wife went to see this movie at black harvest in Chicago in 2008. This film blew everything out of the water! We bought the pass so we can see alot of independent movies but the only one we clearly remember and follow is this film! Prince Adu is amazing.  This film captures the true human spirit of each situation perfectly. Who ever rated this film 3 stars is crazy! or maybe just a film snob. This review is coming from someone who loves films like City of God, Rockers, and films as such. You will not be disappointed! Trust me!",1320364800,4,541,4.252427184466019
