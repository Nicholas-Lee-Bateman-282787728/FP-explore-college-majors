8275662,3,B000BLBZGG,"I bought the wrong one.  The classic one is Total Romance: Initiation.  Some things I do like about this one is that it's still stylish and has some of the same music and actors.  The Initiation one though has better locations,  more style, sophistication, and is more erotic.  Just a better tone.  Still this one is still cool enough to play in the background while a lady friend is over.  A Czech girl I was with actually complimented the interestingness of this playing in the back ground.",1448150400,,492,4.586206896551724
8275663,3,B000BLBZGG,If you are looking for something different then this video might suit you.  It is a little slow at first the but the sex and its intensity pick up at the end.  The women are not top shelf but attractive.  I would imagine there is better French soft core out there.,1173398400,4,264,4.137254901960785
