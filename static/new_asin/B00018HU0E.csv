8007972,5,B00018HU0E,"After the Sweeney, Hazell is the best British Detective Series from the 1970's. Nicolas Ball played James Hazell a Cockney and a cockey Private Eye who despite his expensive clothes and sports car (Hazell would say flash motor), is almost always broke.

What makes this show worth watching are the storylines, the humour and the characters such as Roddy Mcmillen as Inspector 'Choc' Minty, a dour Scottish policeman who likes but does not approve of Hazell. Also Hazell's 'Cousin Tell' played by Desmond McNamara and his landlady 'Dot' played by Barbara Young.

What makes the series stand out is Hazell's dialogue a kind of Cockney Sam Spade, tough,laconic and funny. What we all know however is the Hazell is really to kind hearted to be a true hard boiled private eye.

Nicolas Ball is also perfect for the part.

Americans may struggle with the Cockney slang, as indeed did most of the rest of Britain, but for a few hours good entertainment take a risk and watch Hazell.",1156982400,3,975,4.785714285714286
