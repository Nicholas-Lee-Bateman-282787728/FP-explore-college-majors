710871,5,6303620256,A true masterpiece.  This film will stand out as one of the best animation features of all time.  The director has made small figures come alive better than actors. The sound track is fantastic and the images you won't soon forget.  This is a real treat for anyone who loves cinema!,1124150400,3,282,4.490196078431373
710872,5,6303620256,"I originally saw this at college while annebriated, then absolutely had to go back and watch it again sober.  Then I had to buy the VHS, and now am eyeing the DVD.
Rather than listening to dialogue, you must use your eyes to ""hear"" what is going on.  Several friends went along with me to see this at college, and they were strangely satisfied when I described it as a portrayal of Tom Thumb as a pawn (or son of) God sent to quietly liberate a hopelessly degraded and lost humanity. In this world, science has imprisoned God, and Tom is there to liberate him.
While the film was quiet (virtually no dialogue), my mind was alive with thoughts; this experience is truly a refreshing one.",1089417600,5,686,4.436507936507937

710874,2,6303620256,"I've never written a review before, but I feel a moral obligation to refute all the 5-star ratings this POS has gotten.
I give it two stars because it's interesting on a technical level and intriguing on a ""What were these guys smoking?"" level, but still unwatchable.  This movie is truly for people with no taste--people who only like weird things for the sake of their being weird--people who quote philosophers they don't understand, or laugh at jokes they never even got.  If Tron had no story whatsoever, I would give it a 4-star review based on technical merit alone, and that's why I give Tom Thumb two.
The movie won several obscure awards.  It opens up with beautiful claymation full of vivid colors, and a really cool Huxley reference.  Babies in jars, a fly that perches on some machinery above a conveyer, then gets its head cut off in a gear and contaminates a jar.  Things were looking really good.  Then 75 seconds in we fade to the title, and things go downhill FAST.  There are a couple real people slowed down to the jerky framerate of the claymation.  There is no dialogue, just grunting.  There is just no plot whatsoever.  Tom is cast out and wanders around some unepxlained places, some sort of factory, wherever... grunting at the things he sees.  It's downright painful.  His mother dies.  He wanders around some more.  His father dies.  More wandering.  I made a big effort.  I tried to give it a chance.  I watched the first 40 minutes with a friend (we're both big digital animation fans), and that was hard work.  This is the only movie I own that I could not sit through the whole thing.
Take The Nightmare Before Christmas, remove the plot and all but one unsightly character, make it jerky enough to give you a headache, and you have Tom Thumb.
There is a short film on the DVD called ""The Saint Inspector,"" which is mostly just an obease clay man atop a pole being poked and prodded by a thing with a collapsing telescope for a head.  That was at least entertaining, but it still managed to be slow and dull, while only four minutes long.  The Tom Thumb feature is 70 excrutiating minutes.
I've got nothing against weird or low-budget flicks.  My friends look at my 100 DVD's and say, ""Man, why do you have so much dumb stuff?""  Maybe my idea of good offbeat movies is a little mainstream...  Being John Malkovich, Dr. Strangelove, Run Lola Run, Taxi Driver, Tree's Lounge, every Kevin Smith / Tarantino film, staples of anime like Wicked City...  I even get a kick out of lame stuff like Dolomite, Shock Corridor, Rocky Horror and Chesty Morgan flicks.",978825600,9,2585,4.579520697167756
710875,5,6303620256,"A bizarre and engrossing mix of stop-motion live actors and claymation is  used in this reworking of the old Tom Thumb story. This new Tom is created  utilizing genetically engineered baby goo, and his clay self is born to  normal but inept parents. Ominous men in black lurk in the grimy shadows,  waiting to snatch young Tom, but the boy manages to find his way back to  the lab where the mystery of his origins, and others like him, await.",968025600,3,442,4.475

7853373,5,6303620256,"If you were expecting the happy little tale of the tiny little fellow who sings, cavorts and backflips from daisy to daisy, do yourself a favor and back out of the room now.  Just trust me and go.

This is such a hard thing to review. I don't even know what to call it: Cautionary tale, nightmare dystopean fable, a dark fairy tale -- or simply the ravings of an unsound mind. First of all, the techniques involved in putting it together are astounding. The claymation, the animation, all are of top quality. It's what these techniques convey that becomes problematic.  After the first five minutes, one part of me wanted nothing more than to turn it off and forget it ever happened, but another part of me was hooked. This is not just some schlocky bit of nonsense made to shock gullible kids. A lot of work went into accomplishing...whatever it is it accomplishes.

There are some scenes that are truly disgusting, that made me sick to my stomach, but at some point, looking away became impossible and the sadness and humanity and even, occasionally, an underlying beauty are revealed. Although you kinda have to look fast for those parts, because they are outnumbered to an great extent by the gross stuff.  So do I say ""Watch this--it is so horrible you can't take your eyes off of it? And when you're finished, don't forget to slow down and enjoy the next car accident you pass!""

The story is your basic fairytale, only deformed.  A pair of grotesques give birth to a long-awaited and much loved child. Except their offspring is not the gargoyle one might have expected them to bring forth, it is instead a small and perfectly shaped infant, about the size of a human thumb.  Naturally fate will not let them live happily ever after and the homonculis attracts the attention of Evil Scientists who are part of an Evil Government.  Tom is snatched away and thereby hangs a tale which is neither linear nor respectful of the general rules of story telling.

On the surface, The  Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb is a grisly little story of misshapen minds and bodies in an alternative and insect ridden universe.  Dig a little deeper and it becomes even more unpleasant. There is a plot, and it is complex and multi-layered, involving corruption, politics, genetics, love, responsibility, murder, kidnapping, hopes fulfilled, depravity, betrayal, disappointment, bravery, self-sacrifice, dreams destroyed and friendly rodents. It's sometimes hard to follow.

The visuals are so repellant and discomfiting, the characters can be random or cruel, and the whole universe so chaotic, one finds oneself watching each scene unfold individually without linking together what went before. At times there is a total disconnect...no sense whatsoever of caring about the creatures performing the actions. Whether this was planned by the filmmakers or just the result of an overabundance of ugly images, I don't know.

So do I recommend this movie? Absolutely. There is a dark fascination in the truly horrible, and this film certainly has that, in spades.  Five stars because, for what it is, it is very good.  But if you choose not to watch it, you are probably making the right choice. I would never have come across it but for the interference and insistence of a good friend, a person with a keen but skewed intellect and a wide and only occasionally frightening range of interests, who forces me to leave my comfort zone every now and then.",1374710400,3,3436,4.837883959044369
7853374,5,6303620256,"I cannot believe that this is on dvd, when I was in highschool I had to order it out of state from the one store that had a vhs copy. I grew up watching SBS late night shorts, enthralled by all the strange tales that independent film makers were telling. Tom Thumb blew them all out of the water. In terms of vision, grotesquerie, emotional impact, and fist-to-the-face, ugly, atmospheric film making; it surpassed anything I had ever seen before. The stop-motion animation, which includes live, human actors, is brilliantly captured. There's an awkwardness to the movement, as one would well expect, but it ties in with the squalor of the set pieces and hard lives that the characters live. The puppets are awkward looking but I can't imagine that a less crude creation would suit the mood of the film as well.
I remember the film starting a little slow, and honestly, even during the quiet moments you are well aware that the director is setting the audience up for an emotional fall. I encourage anyone viewing to go with it. The end is painful, and not entirely unexpected but worth watching. It's not for everyone, but if you like a walk through fairytales as they used to be, you will enjoy this.",1342569600,,1202,4.621495327102804
7853375,4,6303620256,"This sort of ilk is just my candy. Dave Borthwick directed one of the most bent interpretations of a classic fairytale you are likely to ever stumble upon. ""The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb"" (1993) is a dark and twisted stop-motion animated feature that follows the life of the mute, fetus-like Tom Thumb who is kidnapped by scientists, meets mutated apparitions in a lab, escapes with the help of a cybernetic lizard-monster, meets a settlement of elf-like creatures led by Jack the Giant Killer and (like Terr in ""Fantastic Planet"") uses his understanding of the giants and the elves to try and bring about peace and reunite with his Giant father. The giants munch grotesque, slippery bugs and terrorize the elf people for sport. Tom Thumb, being the only innocent, might be the only one who can bring peace to the world. The film is much more of a riddle than I have explained, so please watch it. The real pleasure of ""Tom Thumb"" comes from the fantastic look of the film and the bizarre humor and fantastically dense and strange atmosphere. It is at times a comedy, a tragedy, an action movie, a spy flick, a film noir, etc. It is a stop-motion film, but only half of the cast are clay puppets, the rest are human performers and they are also manipulated via stop-motion in a slow-going process called pixelation. This process gives the film a very distinct flavor and also allows for the seamless integration and interaction of puppet characters with human actors. Even after seeing it five times the finale still baffles me (see it for yourself). Overall the film is very perplexing and odd, but ultimately a lot of fun and comes recommended for those with a cock-eyed idea of how fairy tales should be told.",1308096000,2,1717,4.707641196013289
7853376,5,6303620256,"I've been catching up on strange films that everyone's been recommending for awhile, and now I'm determined to start posting more reviews so that these jewels can get more notice.  When crap like Twilight or The IT Crowd get hundreds of reviews, and astounding stuff like this gets less than twenty, it's time to take action.  You should definitely own a copy of this movie, or at least see it.  The level of detail is like a darker, grittier, dystopian Wallace & Gromit.  It seems like every inch of the frame is deliberate.  This is one of those movies that will rewire your brain permanently.  Unlike so much of the fluff out there, it's filled with visual moments that you will never forget.  I wish the filmmaker had stayed independently-minded, instead he went on to co-create the horrible CG movie Doogal (it has a different name in Europe, but just as crappy an experience).",1278720000,,882,4.688311688311688
7853377,5,6303620256,"This film is an adult version of the childrens fairy tale ""Tom Thumb"", but believe me this film aint no fairy tale. This film is set in a dingy part of London and is basically about a lower class couple who give birth to a tiny child the size of a thumb who is kidnaped and taken to an experimental laboritory which he subsequently escapes from. He then meets a community of similar sized people who help him to find his parents. This film is visualy spectacular. It is a stop motion animation film with live actors that are stop motion animated to interact with the claymation models which works together brilliantly and gives the film a strange, jumpy feel that keeps you on edge right from the start. Combined with and amazing soundtrack consisting of bands like ""Sheep On Drugs"", ""Startled Insects"" and a Theme by John Paul Jones, the former bassist for Led Zepplin, this film is a must see. Five stars",1220140800,,906,4.530487804878049
7853378,5,6303620256,"An unusual and remarkable mixture of claymation and stop-motion animation, this movie is a twisted take on the stories of Tom Thumb and Jack the Giant Killer. Pretty creepy--lots of insects, grimy back alleys, and a sinister science lab.  A must for lovers of the genre or for anyone who admires Jan Svankmeyer.",1179187200,2,311,4.867924528301887
7853379,5,6303620256,"Possibly the strangest film ever made. This is extremely creative, but it has a nasty, violent undercurrent to it. I gave it 5 stars because it is a brilliant piece of work, but I actually didn't care for it. It was just too weird for me. There is hardly any talking at all in this film, which sometimes makes it hard to follow the storyline. Bugs seem to run rampant all over everything, and Tom looks like E.T.

But I do reccomend viewing this because you will not see anything like it.",1163980800,4,488,4.304347826086956
7853380,5,6303620256,"Rivetting claymation and stop-motion acting after the Svankmajer vision of animation. This is a total justification of the means employed to cast a grotesque view of Innocence abroad in a corrupt world. The corrupt world is peopled with freaks who totter and stutter about barely audible, and bereft of much other than appetites; sort of Max Beckmann animated. Mesmerizingly inventive; with Tom's world chock to the eyeballs with bugs and creepies plaguing a scape of compressed alleys and decrepit buildings. With a William Burroughs infested script, this is the antidote to Wallace and Gromit, if one were required. Highly recommended.",1134345600,2,637,5.38
