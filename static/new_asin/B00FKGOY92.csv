5994705,5,B00FKGOY92,Of the best television shows I've seen in my life. Simply marvelous.,1422316800,3,68,4.75
5994706,5,B00FKGOY92,"If you miss this show as much as I do, and you want a copy, you'll pretty much have to settle on the Region 2 version from Great Britain.  This is the complete series of 13 episodes, however, you will need a region free player to watch it, or you will need to rip the episodes to digital file to play them.  I got mine from England in just short of 2 weeks and have already watched each episode.  Well worth the money, especially now that the price has come down to about half of what it was.",1419206400,9,492,4.0
5994707,5,B00FKGOY92,"Ok, first of all, it was terrible that this show was ever cancelled. It definitely had a good following. The imagery and the acting is superb. The relationships in this series are realistic and I love to see how despite so many variables, the main character is determined to stick to his wife. It is a wonderful and beautiful series and if you did not get a chance to see it when it was out, you MUST see it. I hope someone will bring it back, but they'd have to do so quickly because I don't think it will work with any other actors. The casting, the directing, the producing....everything was on point. 5 STARS. I'd give it 6 if I could.",1474848000,2,639,4.245901639344262
5994708,5,B00FKGOY92,"Enjoyed the show, It played on my computer just fine. It was a surprise to know there are different zones for dvds I read another post explaining that I can watch with a computer.",1469923200,,179,4.294117647058823
5994709,5,B00FKGOY92,"I should have read the description a little more closely.  I live in the United States and the description on this seller's item CLEARLY states that will have a restriction on playing via DVD player in the US.  That being said, I got it to work on my computer, hooked that up to my TV, and had zero issues!  The DVDs arrived well before Amazon said they would and they were in pristine condition!  So happy to have found one of my favorite shows so reasonably priced! I would definitely purchase from this seller again!",1461974400,,519,4.431578947368421
5994710,5,B00FKGOY92,Once I got the right DVD region player it was great. Just need to watch out for region DVD's,1456790400,,92,3.8947368421052633
5994711,5,B00FKGOY92,One of my all-time favorite shows. It took years but the long-awaited DVD is finally here and it's a great product to behold.,1453420800,,125,4.478260869565218
5994712,5,B00FKGOY92,This show is really good.  Kevin McKidd is wonderful.  Definitely cancelled too soon.  But at least Kevin is on Grey's Anatomy.  Love to see him work!,1431820800,3,150,4.653846153846154
5994713,2,B00FKGOY92,I love the show it's one of my favorites but I haven't been able to appreciate it fully because it was never mentioned that because of region settings on DVD players and copyright law it will not plan on all DVD players therefore the DVD player that I have will not play so far I have not been able to watch it.,1427328000,,311,4.032258064516129
5994714,5,B00FKGOY92,"After waiting for a Region 1, I finally gave up and bought a Region 2 copy and a Multi region DVD player. Love the show and couldn't wait anymore! I was watching the series on Hulu however it was removed! Great investment and hoping what I purchased works.",1424304000,2,256,4.354166666666667
5994715,5,B00FKGOY92,I'm bummed! I SERIOUSLY want this released in the US! Great show IMO and feel it wasn't given a chance.,1423872000,4,103,4.2
5994716,5,B00FKGOY92,Very good video transfer.,1423699200,2,25,5.5
8616313,5,B00FKGOY92,great show,1526601600,,10,4.5
8616314,5,B00FKGOY92,"This was one of my favorite television series, but it was cut short by the writer's strike, and for 10 years I've been unable to find it in the USA.",1523577600,,148,3.966666666666667
8616315,5,B00FKGOY92,"Watched this show when it was on ten years ago, and I loved it. Was a little afraid that it might not have aged well, but after seeing it again, it's just as good as ever. One of the best sci-fi shows ever on television. It's a damn shame it was cancelled so soon.
And the two documentaries in the extras add a ton of insight into how the show began, and what might've happened if it was allowed to continue.",1519862400,,408,4.049382716049383
8616316,5,B00FKGOY92,"Out of desperation, I went ahead and bought the Region 2 version. I absolutely loved this series a decade ago. The way it ended, after the creators found out it was cancelled, could not have been more perfect.",1518652800,,209,4.526315789473684
8616317,4,B00FKGOY92,"Described item as is, had prompt shipping. Had to make my dvd player play a region 2 dvd, but it was described by seller in description accurately. Good experience.",1515369600,,164,4.689655172413793
8616318,5,B00FKGOY92,Arrived much earlier than expected and plays in my computer.,1512864000,,60,5.1
8616319,5,B00FKGOY92,"I've loved this series from the moment I saw it, and was always disappointed that it only got a DVD release in the UK. Fortunately, there's at least one downloadable video player (I use VLC) that will let me watch these on my desktop in the US without faffing about with region coding. The 75-minute retrospective is amazing and the deleted/alternate scenes OK. I haven't explored all the features yet, but I'm a little disappointed there's no gag reel, as I know one exists.

But I'd never not buy it just because of that. The episodes alone are worth the cost of the set, and the extras are wonderful, wonderful gravy.",1488758400,2,620,4.585585585585585
8616320,5,B00FKGOY92,"The curse of my life is to become involved and appreciate series that, for whatever reason, don't make the cut. After waiting forever for this series with just one season to be released I finally looked across the pond and found it there. With an all region Blu-ray player I've found this is the reason to keep one around- getting to see things our sad entertainment media distribution efforts seem bound to fail at.
A surprising thing happened as well. Watching these episodes again after a decade has proved to me how much better the series was than I recalled.
Still, it's good to have them to revisit even if the intended American audience dropped the ball.",1488326400,4,661,4.6581196581196584
8616321,4,B00FKGOY92,"Great show too bad it was cut short before it got its legs stretched, I think Netflix or Amazon should revisit and cast all these actors and continue the story NBC dumped it too quickly, It def has plenty more potential story to go, hope the powers that be read this and pitch it for continuation, music was great too!!",1486512000,5,319,4.333333333333333
8616322,5,B00FKGOY92,One of my favorite time travel shows! I was surprised it played in VLC player and I didn't have to switch my computer's format.,1482019200,,127,4.333333333333333
