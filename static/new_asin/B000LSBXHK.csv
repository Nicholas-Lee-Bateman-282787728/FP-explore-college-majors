2713291,5,B000LSBXHK,"This work is about new time and new exodus of youth leaving Orthodoxy-in this case, of the Jewish origin.

Mendy, a Chassidic teen, was on large for his sexual explorations and sheltered by Yankel having made his way from 62nd Str. D/N Station in Brooklyn, N.Y.C., into a secular world years earlier.

Viewers might agree or not about all intense shown, of which international drug trafficking is a part of, but what is utterly clear-no visual traditional attributes-no job wherever, is hardly to quarrel with, by the most of those having done this way even centuries ago.

That is, probably, a reason for all the jobs depicted story's Jewish secular characters doing.

English subtitles provide context much diplomatically than original Yiddish while I could place this low-budget movie on my shelf anyway.

Music is very kosher, the last song accompanying cast list, definitely.

Bianca is wise and beautiful, and actor plays Mendy simply brilliantly.

Enjoy!",1320969600,,961,5.161290322580645
2713292,5,B000LSBXHK,"I am sorry this movie is so poorly reviewed and is looked upon by many as a two-dimensional contrast between a frum/halachic life or descent into Yetzer Hara. Or that some see this as a denial of Yiddishkeit or are offended by the significant questions it raises. The fact is that Haredi or Hassidic sectarian Jews makes up a tiny fraction of the Jewish population, so Mendy ""mainstreaming"" is the state that the vast majority of Jews are now living. If you see Judaism as a Soulful religion rather than a Spiritual religion, then the question is ""what is Jewish Soul?"" Can you be Jewish, or connected to Jewish Soul, without being strictly halachic?
The movie contrasts two characters; Mendy and Yankel. Yankel is truly a ""lost soul."" He is completely involved in drug use and sexual encounters, hanging out in strip clubs and dealing X. He says ""women are like lemons, you squeeze what you can and then throw them out."" Mendy on the other hand sees the emptiness and pain, and may I say insanity, in Yankel, and does not accept or strive for a life ruled by soullessness and indulgence in the yetzer hara. He can also no longer live a Haredi life. So, what is he to do? What understanding does he need to come to?
Many reviews intimate that this movie rejects Yiddishkeit, that Mendy is a ""bad Jew."" But I think Mendy says it all when speaking of Yankel, ""He cannot be a good human because he could not be a good Hassid."" Who could not get the meaning when Mendy walks away from Yankel to go to the mikvah? Or be moved when Mendy is himself is spontaneously moved to lay tefillin which he is traveling with in his backpack?
Mendy's sister comes to see him in his apartment and tells him that the Rebbe of the community says that the reason Mendy is being tempted is because he has a ""great soul"" (It is a Hassidic belief that the ""evil inclination"" doesn't bother with the ordinary person). As Mendy says to his girlfriend ""it take a lifetime to study Torah."" That leads me to ask, why wouldn't it also take a lifetime to connect to your soul in the deepest way?
The end of the movie says ""Revolution don't give answers, only sometimes they will change the questions."" This movie does not preach, judge or give answers. Many Jews of my generation, after being raised to believe that Judaism is strictly a set of arbitrary, restrictive rituals and superstitions, carried out for tribal reasons, are now returning to the heart of Jewish practice. This is what this movie, to me, is trying to point to. Not a simple subject.
I apologize that this review is directed towards Jewish readers.",1304035200,12,2588,4.54389721627409
2713293,1,B000LSBXHK,"What's the point of this movie? That you are a Jew if your mother was born into the Tribe even if you reject everything that Judaism stands for? Isn't there some level of moral and ethical behavior that is required even if it is not the extreme world of Chassidism. Don't Jews have to belong to a Jewish community and celebrate at least some of the basic rituals? I won't spoil the end of this film for potential viewers, but to me it was highly unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, ""Mendy"" does raise the very timely question of ""Who is a Jew?"" For me, it is not Mendy.",1295049600,2,562,4.3619047619047615
2713294,5,B000LSBXHK,"Firstly, I thought that the depth of this film lay primarily in the portrait of its three central characters. It does not have a particularly compelling narrative, but then my spouse likes to point out that I am attracted to films that lack a clear narrative. It is beautifully acted.

I should add here - and this point is really why I bothered to write this - that the film is not terribly accessible to an audience that is not acquainted with Chassidic culture (or at least Orthodox Jewish culture). Unlike in cheesy movies like ""A Price Above Rubies"", in Mendy Chassidic culture is neither spoon-fed to the viewer, nor is it avoided. It simply textures most of the film, which is exactly how it functions in real life. (A brief aside: I am an Orthodox Jew, very familiar with the culture being portrayed on screen, and I have never seen it more convincingly portrayed. Neither in English language or in Israeli cinema. The actors' command of Yiddish (in Hungarian dialect) is fantastic, their body language perfect... I was convinced that they are former Chassidim, and shocked and amazed to discover that they are not.)

Also, in response to some comments about gratuitous swearing and hedonism, this element of the film will be instantly understood by anyone who has encountered people who grow up in such a protective and insular environment and break out of it. They very often tend to extremes, and former Chassidim (particularly from Satmar, as they lack many of the social and language skills to integrate into broader society; although in Lubavitch a period of hedonism is almost a rite of passage) sometimes fall into such lifestyles. So in short, I do not believe it is gratuitous at all - it is simply realistic.

I would like to add that I do not think that my above observations should mean that the film can not be appreciated by non-Jewish or by secular-Jewish viewers. It simply has to be seen as a human drama set in and around what is really an immigrant culture, a culture very foreign to most people. But the characters are compelling, the drama is engaging, it is a beautifully composed film. I enjoyed it immensely, and I hope you do too.",1290988800,20,2164,4.704485488126649
2713295,2,B000LSBXHK,"As a non-Jew I was hoping for a way to learn more about the orthodox life, but I'm not at all sure I found it in this film, interesting though it was at times.  I certainly appreciated hearing Yiddish...something I had never been exposed to at all and was thankful for the subtitles.

I think some of the meaning and the questions presented were sincere and reasonably well conceived, yet the obvious effort to be edgy and raw with ugly street language, doping, sex, etc. made the film into something rather mundane.  The acting was okay, direction okay, production in general okay...but overall, at least for me, it was disappointing and no better than two stars.",1251331200,2,664,4.706896551724138

What Mendy is - a poor quality film (cinematography and acting), about two former Chessidim who get kicked out of the community and find a greater appreciation with the outside life of promiscuous sex and illegal drug trade.  This movie was filled with useless profanity and nudity.  I was sorley disappointed.  Anyone want a free copy of Mendy???",1198454400,9,562,5.142857142857143
2713297,5,B000LSBXHK,"I watched this movie in the Manhattan theater in June of 2006. This is one great movie that you will fall in love with. Although it's my belief that some knowledge (of) and/or Jewish background is necessary in order to grasp the meaning of the movie and not to misjudge the characters and the plot. Otherwise, you'd be asking (just like Bianca in the movie did) ""So, your G-d is a racist then"".

I think that this is a very honest movie and raises some important issues that we don't usually want to deal with or even admit to ourselves (well, this does apply to me) they (issues) exist and affect us in one way or another.",1172707200,19,623,4.3247863247863245

I am not a professional movie critic,  hell films are forbidden by us Hasidim to watch. But i watched this in a dark moment of sin of my hasidic life, i already repented.

8163974,5,B000LSBXHK,"I had low hopes for this movie but was instantly shocked at just how good it was. ""Mendy"" isn't a movie for everyone, but if you are familiar with the Chasidish community and Williamsburg in particular, you will instantly recognize what is going on here and why it matters. I've been out of New York for about fifteen years now, and what's happening in this movie post-dates me; I've only read about it from a distance. What we are looking at is the ""Off The Derech"" situation, where a young person in a very religious community has somehow fallen from grace. In this case the problem is that Mendy is heterosexual (!) which may not seem like a trespass to ordinary people but in the ultra-insular sphere of Williamsburg, any display of sexuality is considered gross, taboo and strictly forbidden.

What's so great about this movie, and what earns it five stars in my book, is that the characters are so finely drawn. Unlike most depictions of religion in Hollywood (with the exception of Christian independent film), ""Mendy"" doesn't portray a religious upbringing or a religious community as ""bad."" As Mendy himself says, in so many words, you have to look at the world in shades of gray and not in black and white, and the film successfully does this. Instead of preaching about the right way to live by having a single character espouse it, the film shows us a small group of complicated people, some better, some worse, but all of them trying to get by.

The portrayal of the Israeli drug smuggler was frightening and I could easily imagine this scheme playing out across the lives of many young people who exist in an underworld where drugs and prostitution have become ordinary. It was laughable and sadly recognizable when the Israeli and the Chasidim needed to get their business done before Shabbos, as illegal as their business was. Like - they didn't see any contradiction there, nothing to even talk about.

My favorite scene of all, and the one that makes the entire show worth watching all by itself, is the Shabbos dinner where the excommunicated Chasidim (Satmar and Lubavitch alike), the transvestites, and OTDers sit around and trade cholent, challah, gefilte fish and insults.

I can't help but note how frequently Black people are characterized as the spiritual soul of a Jewish movie, and this one was no exception, as Bianca saves Mendy from a life of ""constantly playing a part"" by putting him in touch with his body and his self. Oddly, the body is the very thing that ultra-Orthodox Judaism cannot reconcile with spirituality...but it is the key to bringing Mendy back.

Really an amazing movie, again not for everyone, but I found it profound and disturbing and beautiful.",1475366400,4,2698,4.7935483870967746

8163978,2,B000LSBXHK,"The reviews here show this movie is polarizing, as half the reviews are either a '5' or a '1' (at the time of this writing).  The reason, perhaps, is that the movie is itself polarized.  On the one hand, its objectives and basic theme are significant issues that many wrestle with and even those who are not themselves challenged by such questions can empathize with the challenge to others.  So, perhaps like me, they arrived at the film with anticipation.  On the other hand, apparently to avoid being ""boring"" or philosophical, the actual script is an extreme and coarse caricature of this personal dilemma.

The alternative to a frum life is, for this film, a vulgar, promiscuous drug dealer active and actively propagating meaningless relationships, petty crime, and dissolute living.  One result of the decision to use gutter-living as the alternative to religious discipline is dialogue that is not just profane -- sometimes this can seem authentic or organic to a character -- but offensive, unnecessary, and ""put on"" rather than natural behavior.  The script is littered with gratuitous ""symbols"" of fully secular living -- beer from bottles in the morning, nude women walking through scenes, yelling replacing talking, booming statements replacing conversation, petty crime and extravagant shows of autonomy replacing common sense interactions.

This tension set up by picking a serious and nearly universal life challenge and then rendering it for cinema through characters living out their choices in ways so extreme it is hard to suspend belief and get into the actual subject matter.  The script is unskillful enough that the acting seems unnaturally impassioned, the dialogue unrealistically coarse, the ""props"" too uniform an evidence of a life style that the viewing experience is polarized:  either, as some, attached to the interesting theme and insights or, for others, put off and even offended by the coarse caricatures and vulgarity.

I didn't think the representation of either religious or secular life rung true.  The vulgarity and nudity is so immediate and gratuitous it is not only distracting but, in its relentlessness, offensive.  The movie, if taken seriously, seems to represent a collection of life choices none of which seem natural, let alone appealing.",1459209600,5,2290,5.258241758241758
