7909925,4,B00000IC3U,"...This is a DVD with a limited appeal, as it is highly specific to a small target audience.

...It has no sound track, being silent film shot during WWI in B&W on 16mm stock....taken from the ground and aerial views from biplanes. If you have an interest in historic film-footage, you will like this.

...I build scale replicas of early aircraft, and am working on two biplanes from the WWI era, so this was used for reference material for me, and had some footage that gave me more detail, which is why I bought this. Consider that before you buy, but if it has interest for you as well, it is fascinating to watch.",1362787200,,617,4.4035087719298245
