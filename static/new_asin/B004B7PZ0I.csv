8421610,5,B004B7PZ0I,"The Creagers have been in the art doll business for over 30 years. This instructional video is similar to the workshops they used to teach. Jodi Creager is an excellent instructor , she covers all the possible areas of sculpting hands one would encounter when sculpting themselves. The knowledge she imparts to the viewer makes it seem very possible to be able to sculpt as well as she does !
Would recommend to others interested in sculpting art dolls from polymer clay.",1353715200,,471,4.7560975609756095
