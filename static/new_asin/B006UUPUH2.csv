8504831,5,B006UUPUH2,"I really like Donna Eden's teachings.  However sometimes there are gaps to fill in if you can not get to the seminars.  And even though I highly recommend all of her materials, I like to learn more.  This is one of those cases.  Ellen is an insightful, intelligent and sometimes funny teacher.  The DVD's include a CD containing the complete outline of the course, so it is easy to follow along or for future reference while doing the exercises.  Up until I received this course, quite a few of these techniques were not known to me.  It is good to know the basics in Donna's book.  Also, you might want to get the DVD sets in order, ""Energy Fluency"" being the first if I remember.  However if you have been practicing energy medicine for a while, you can get the hang of this.  Ellen is that good of a teacher.  I really like what she does with the spinal doorways.  I can't recommend this high enough.",1442880000,2,903,4.373493975903615
