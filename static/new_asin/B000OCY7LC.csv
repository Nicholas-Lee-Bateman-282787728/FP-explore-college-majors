8184494,3,B000OCY7LC,There are much better episodes of this series.,1462924800,,46,4.875
8184495,5,B000OCY7LC,I used to have a bunch of these on VHS so many years ago.  It was wonderful to be able to buy these and share them with my nephew.  I just wish all of them were available on DVD.,1445817600,,178,3.5384615384615383
8184496,5,B000OCY7LC,"Anyone growing up in the 60's -70's will remember all the holiday cartoons and claymatian they watched at Xmas, Easter, Halloween, etc. Short of Charles Schultz masterpiece Peanuts cartoons, every holiday you would find a bunch of Rankin/Bass. These stories are from them and they are so recognizable in the drawing, colors, and even voices. Love Rankin?Bass!? Then you will want these!",1334188800,,386,5.241935483870968
8184497,4,B000OCY7LC,"I was particularly keen to buy this volume. The Fairytales include ""Arabian Knights"" and ""Robin Hood.""
If you're an Australian buyer, the Australian DVD box set ""10 Movies Family Fun"" gives you ten of Rankin Bass's Festival of Family Classics episodes. I was able to collect VHS copies of the rest (2nd hand).
But these two episodes always eluded me, until this volume came out.
And I bought Volumes 1 & 3 as well, for better remastered copies of the episodes on those DVDs.
Bernard Cowan's narration on the beginning theme leads into that lovely song, which is the charm of the series.
Relive your own childhood, or buy it for your kids. These are fairytales told in a standard as appealing as Disney.",1212192000,4,702,4.669354838709677
