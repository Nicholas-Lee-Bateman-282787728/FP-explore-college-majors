8655227,1,B00K1RLH54,"Horrendously out of focus video, complete with all standard VHS anomalies of a 3rd-4th generation copy (DVD-R). Could no longer continue watching after 15 minutes due to eye strain while trying to focus. Far worse than any of those terrible ALPHA VIDEO transfers. The cover art of the DVD was not even the same as shown on the product preview, but it was the worst package insert I have ever seen. I was tempted to print my own, but the entire DVD was so bad that I just garbaged the whole thing. Never again!",1411516800,3,509,4.425531914893617
