7959466,3,B000063K1V,"Despite the title this film is actually the first in the 90's Zero Woman franchise. It is not an action film like later entries. Instead the story is a political drama that is drawn out and may cause a viewer not to try later films. An important government minister is planning to run for prime minister and his daughter is also planning to enter politics. However, the daughter runs down her boyfriend in a pique of anger and her father uses Section 1 to cover it up. Rei is an agent of Section Zero that is currently dealing with corruption in Section 4. Division 0 is the black ops of the Tokyo police dept. Essentially, both Section 0 and Section 1 are at odds with each other. Plotting is slow and the viewer can figure everything out and see the outcome after the thirty minute mark. The only thing that surprises is the strange dwarf that Section 1 uses as an interrogator. An okay film BUT only for those that are already familiar with the franchise.",1375401600,,958,4.448863636363637
