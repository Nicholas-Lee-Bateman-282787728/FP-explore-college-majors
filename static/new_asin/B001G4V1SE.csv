Bought a few others of her DVDs and she's the same in them all!  When I want to get a laugh and a workout (which by the time you are done laughing the workout is over and you forgot you were working out) I pop this DVD in.  She's great fun.",1236297600,27,372,3.670886075949367
3595617,3,B001G4V1SE,"Based on Beth's review, I recognize many of the movements, and I'm guessing this new DVD is an almost exact replica of the ""Speedy, Non-Stop"" with perhaps an added exercise or perhaps a variation of a couple.  I already have the Speedy, Non-Stop"" DVD, so I'm not inclined to ""re-purchase"" it through the Cougar Workout.

Joyce is a very good instructor, though.",1232928000,10,361,4.806451612903226
3595618,3,B001G4V1SE,"This was my first experience with veteran instructor Joyce Vedral, who is so full of personality that she is nearly bursting through the screen.  In this workout, she takes a term usually thought to have a negative connotation, cougar (ie, as most people consider a cougar to be an older woman on the prowl), and makes it her own, insisting that a cougar is a woman who has decided to look good no matter how old she gets.  Along that vein, Joyce performs the workout with two female background exercisers, and she states that between the three of them, their average age is 53.

While Joyce's personality is definitely a bit over-the-top, the workout itself is solid.  It is intended to be used as either a 2-Day or a 3-Day split.  For the first option, you would do Upper Body the first day (28.5 minutes), Lower Body the next day (35 minutes), repeat twice, and rest on Day 7.  For Option 2, you would do Upper Body on Day 1, Legs & Back on Day 2 (15.5 minutes), and then Hips & Abs on Day 3 (19.5 minutes), repeating the sequence once.  All of the weight work is performed in a pyramid style--ie, you repeat a sequence of exercises for 12 repetitions each using your lightest weight, then pyramid up to a mid-weight for a second set of 10 reps each, and finally, you use your heaviest weight for a final set of 8 reps per exercise.  Joyce encourages you to start light or even use no weights at first if needed.

All of the exercises for each segment are listed below.  Joyce moves quickly from one exercise to another without pausing for rest between exercises or between sets.

UPPER BODY
First 16.6 minutes, standing:
Arnold press
double arm tricpes
reverse Arnold press
concentration curls
single arm kickback
alternating biceps curl
alternating kickback
simulataneous hammer curl
simulataneous kickback
side lateral
shoulder press
Pee-Wee lateral
front lateral

Final 12 minutes, performed on a bench:
flat press
flyes
curl press
triceps press
cross-face
close bench press
single dumbbell extension
(For the second set, Joyce adds a biceps curl and changes the order of exercises; the third set returns to the original order, no biceps curl.)

LOWER BODY/Legs & Back
seated back lateral
seated bent lateral
squat (alternate: standing leg extension)
front squat (alternate: seated leg extension)
bent lateral
hack squat
regular row
side row
palms up row
squat (alternate: seated side leg lift)
one dumbbell squat (alternate: lying leg lift)
upright row
leaning 1-arm dumbbell row
(NOTE:  the alternate exercises are explained briefly on a separate chapter of the DVD entitled ""Special Thigh Work."")

LOWER BODY/Hips & Abs (floorwork)*
Lying on one side:
saddlebag stripper
lower butt side kicks
lower butt curls

Lying on back:
crunch
bent knee lifts
clamshell front
ceiling stone lift
toe reach front
side reach front
bent knee crunch
elbow-to-knee crunch
leg raise
knee ins

Lying on other side, same exercises
*15 reps of all exercises; repeat entire series twice

The Warm-Up is a very brief (1.5 minute) segment that has Joyce and crew performing muscle stretches without sufficiently warming up the body first.  For the ""Cool-Down,"" Joyce and pals spend approximately 30 seconds lightly punching the various muscles worked while repeating over and over ""Ha, ha, ha!  Ha, ha, ha!""  Obviously, this is supposed to be fun, but as with the warm-up, the lack of a decent cool-down really detracts from what is otherwise a very solid workout.

Clearly, Joyce's personality is not going to appeal to everyone.  She is really playing to the camera here, and some might even find her style to be a bit on the cheesey side.  However, I could also see Joyce really connecting with certain women--particularly older ones--who are prepared to fully embrace the idea ""I'm not getting older, I'm getting better!""  If you have never worked out with Joyce before, I would suggest that you view a clip before purchasing this workout.  But if you already know and love Joyce, this workout might be a good addition to your collection.",1231459200,102,4028,4.886764705882353

Each move is done three times, increasing the weight and reducing the reps each time. It's not as good as her Bottoms Up! workout book which  I had some years ago; I wish that could be made into a video.  Joyce's chatter about being a 'cougar' can be annoying, but if you're really concentrating on the workout it's easy to tune that out.  I use this workput 2-3 times/week and I think it's effective.",1440288000,4,502,4.483516483516484
3595627,5,B001G4V1SE,"I purchased this one because others were unavailable.  I have the Bottoms Up book from years ago and found it to be very good, thorough, but time consuming.  This DVD has many of the book's exercises and the same pyramid structure.
I have had it for a week, do the split session in two days. I was using weights that were too heavy to start with and have backed off a bit.
I am able to do the PeeWee , shoulder lifts, other out and up with only the lightest weights.  I can do the curls, other upper, back arm exercises with very heavy weights and more reps for each set. I just do what I can for now.

One needs to get everything in place, weights, bench, (if using one)  before starting, for Joyce moves quickly from exercise to exercise; no rests. There are modified versions of many exercises and Joyce, herself, limits her knee moves.

In a week, my arms are already tighter and I move with more energy.  I have old injuries and use custom insoles and a knee brace while doing this DVD and it works just fine.

I don't care about personalities, music, etc.  I just want a good workout in a fairly short period of time and this delivers.  You will want to do stretches before and after on your own.
UPDATE: Let me preface this by stating that my body is a mess.  My physician even wrote a letter stating that I need to swim for my arthritis.
My body is crooked, I still wear a knee brace so that my knee doesn't go in the wrong direction and wear custom insoles for my damaged foot...I have hiked the Alps twice for 1 month at a time so I really like being active.
I tried on my knee boots yesterday.  Two months ago I could just zip them up.  Now, I will have to tuck my pants in them.  My body sounds like a squeaky door as I go through the weight lifting segments, my lower left back sometimes aches, but it is really working and I know that I am gaining needed muscle.  I am losing inches, as well.  I was, comfortably, wearing a 1x top upon starting.  I am now a medium.  Note: I use two Debby Mack dvds daily, also.  I just got Vedral's Arms and Thighs and add it to my daily routine when able to. I am on the cruise phase of the Dukan diet.  I attribute most of my success to the Cougar workout.
Update 10/07/15 one day before my 67 b-day...60 pound loss and can do everything she throws at me.
May1 2016: I vary this with a couple of other Vedral DVDs, and still use Debby Mack's two.  Results: Size 4 pants, small or x small tops.
I have loads of beautiful muscle, but not bulky. Low fat, no sugar diet, cutting back on protein, now and adding more vegetables.",1437609600,32,2573,4.157575757575757

3595639,5,B001G4V1SE,"Basing my experience on those old Jane Fonda highly-researched well done weight lifting videos, Joyce Vedral's workout is really solid.  If you do this, I'm sure you'll have a young looking neck, face, etc.  I don't know if she's had any surgical work done, but you can pretty much count that most or all of of her great figure is due to strength training.  You can either lift weights and stay young or get surgery and look freaky...and yeah, at first I thought the program was slightly easy, but I was kidding myself.  Ouch!

Revisit!!!

Okay, let's take a revisit of this video - I have been doing it for about a year.

I am buff.  Because I still eat too much sugar, I've only lost a couple of pounds, but my body has acquired a better, more youthful shape.  It is much easier to lose weight when I try, though, as I have a lot of muscle to help me.

The weirdest (best?) parts...my legs are very shapely.  My face actually looks a bit different - I guess when you exercise your neck/shoulders it also exercises the facial muscles.  I was looking at a Facebook selfie...something was different...whoa...my face has tightened up...

Although there are a lot of unedited bloopers in this video, as Joyce says, it is the ""real deal.""  Do it, it works.  You want to stay young looking?  This is it.  As Joyce says, ""the men will come after you.""  Indeed, they do.  ;)",1360454400,19,1367,4.439516129032258
3595640,2,B001G4V1SE,This was the second dvd that was replaced due to the first dvd being defective and upon further investigation of this 2nd dvd replacement order - I found it to be a replicated/burned dvd; which will not always play well on all dvd players!

3595641,5,B001G4V1SE,"I purchased the Bottoms Up book by Joyce Vedral over 10 years ago and I worked the program enough to reach my targeted goal and then I quit.  From time to time I would revert back to it just enough to maintain some form of shape to my body especially when I had a special event to go to. I couldn't get past the idea of exercising alone and reading at the same time continuously--day after day.  However, I have had this tape of the Cougar workout for about a month and I love it!!!  For me, the visual aspect of exercising is much better.  Because I am exercising with Joyce and two of her friends, I don't feel the sense of exercising alone. In this month, I have dropped two pant sizes, not to mention my slimmer and firmer arms.  I even still use the Bottoms Up Workout for firmer thighs and lower legs.  I am not only losing weight and getting firmer and healthier by the day, but I'm enjoying myself while doing it.  Thumbs up to Joyce Vedral for an even more greater venture.",1315353600,16,982,4.219251336898396
3595642,5,B001G4V1SE,"I love Joyce and bought this hoping for a miracle. I had much success with fast forward losing 25 lbs and 25 inches in a month several years ago. I slipped back into bad habits and am starting exercising AGAIN and bought this because I read it was not so much switching from floor to standing which is hard when you are out of shape. I am starting week two of the six day plan and so far so good. You either stand, lie on the bench or on the mat without switching back and forth so its easier to get all the reps in. If you are familiar with Joyce's workouts it has all her classic joyce sets so no learning curve and seems to go fast. I will update after a month reagarding the progress. Already I have much better posture and feel better. My only criticism is she has two people in the background and the ""out of shape"" Nina is so lackluster in even trying to follow the workout and has such bad form and no enthusiasm they should have cut her part out or refilmed it.  The other lady, Maureen, does a great job of follwing Joyce and stays in the moment. Joyce has Maureen keeping count of the reps so you don't have to worry about miscounts, pace, etc as on some of her previous workouts. Recommend you try this even if you are like me and not a cougar as it is very age appropriate if you aren't into jumping around to get a good workout. I give Joyce 5 stars because she is an inspiration to every woman to keep working out and defy stereotypes of what a woman in her 60's ""should expect"" to look like - Go Joyce!  Update - after one month of the Cougar Workout 6x a week with no change in diet I went down two sizes. I consider that great results in that I did not work out even 1/2 hour a day. I would recommend you incorporate some other stretches after your workout as Joyce's are pretty barebones on this dvd. This month I am doing a Joyce workout 6x a week but rotating three different dvd's and will update my results in the future.",1298160000,55,1944,4.113157894736842
3595643,4,B001G4V1SE,"I have 5 of Joyce's workout DVD's and I started with her Bottoms Up book years ago. Joyce look better than ever and her unique personality is well suited to women over 40--who know they won't look like 20 again and who don't need a 20-something instructor barking orders.

I've done Denise Austin, Kathy Smith and (geez I'm old) Jane Fonda. I get frustrated with the well-meaning but smug attitudes. Joyce is different. She says, You'll look better than me! and ""Call security!"" and she talks to camera (us) with empathy and a can-do, I've been there attitude.

For women under 30-35, I recommend you try a dvd with someone in their 20's or 30's because Joyce will seem cheesy and out of touch with your needs.

This is a solid workout like all Joyce's DVDs. I love that I can work through the day's sets in about 20 minutes with real results. No crazy bouncing, jumping, hopping or aerobics--they don't work for me anyway. I have more energy, I can work up to heavier weights and I still do the treadmill 3-4 times a week too. It's not a chore!

This dvd does seem a little less intensive than her other DVDs. I also agree the warmup and cool-down segments are phoned in and need more solid stretches (this is where Joyce has always lacked instruction on all her dvds), but I think it's a great intro to Joyce and working out with weights.",1291420800,22,1340,4.457142857142857

I love this video.  As a self professed couch potato, I have been motivated to get up and do it.  Not just once or twice either, but day after day.  I started at the absolute bottom rung of the fitness ladder with no weights, then 2 pds, then 2 and 3 pds, now I'm up to 2, 3 and 5 pds.  I feel better, look better, laugh more and my stress is disappearing.  I have lost weight and gained so much energy.  Girlfriends I am certain this is a DVD is worth the time and effort.  You need handweights that cost literally a few dollars a set.  I had a bench at the end of my bed that worked perfectly for me, but Joyce will show you how to make it work without a bench.  We all need to be strong, with stamina and a spring in our step.  I like feeling better about myself with every mornings workout.  Buy it!!!  It works, she will motivate you and you won't regret it!  It is not about being perfect, it is about having the ability to enjoy your life.

I am 60 years old and had used Joyce's workouts in the past but had replaced them with working out in the gym. I was recently diagnosed with mild osteoporosis in the spine and decided I needed to be lifting heavier weights. I ordered Joyce's Cougar workout and have really been enjoying exercising with her again. The routine is solid and helps you to gradually work up to higher weights. I can tell a difference already in my arms, back muscles and abdominal tone. Periodically throughout the tape, Joyce just makes me laugh. She talks about getting happier as the exercises progress and that's the way she makes me feel. I just love her personality. It may be a little over the top for some, but for me it's a little like a cute mixture of drill sargeant,cheerleader and comedian. It helps make the exercises go fast. My only complaint is that the  cooldown is inadequate. This isn't a big problem for me, though, as I can do my own, but I would rather have one included on the tape.

(And I can do it right in the bedroom.) One can make it more difficult as time goes on, by upping the weights (I just got a set of 10lbs dumbbells in my favorite neoprene style today as I am going to need them.) But what if you want MORE weights and more muscle strength? The ""Cougar"" workout does more SUPER-DUPER Giant Sets, which are pyramid supersets and then some. After the first Arms workout, I was zonked.

While the Fat-Burning workout has a few pairs of opposing muscle arm exercises (ie, hammer curls versus tricep kickbacks) the ""Cougar"" has additional pairs working the same grouping (ie, double arm tricep reverse press and concentration curls, single arm kickback and alternating bicep curls, then simultaneous hammer curl and simultaneous tricep kickbacks.) This is three sets on the same group (bicep and opposing tricep) and then you repeat, upping weights and reducing reps. In between are shoulder presses of various types and side lateral raises, front lateral and back lateral (""Pee-Wee"") laterals and the evil front lateral (toughest raise for ladies, I think.) The workout finishes with bench work for curls, triceps and flies. This can be done all with dumbbells, but I used to prefer to use a French press bar (no, not a coffee pot in a Seattle espresso spot, it's a bent bar for barbell weights.) Still, dumbbells have their charms; easy to place under the bed and the action of balancing independent weights causes you to use more small muscles in your workout. There is ALWAYS method to Joyce's madness.

Unlike the Fat Meltdown, where a ball substitutes fairly well, a bench would be nice to have (I get away with a capsule-shaped ball instead of a bench.) I was able to use a capsule ball for the lower body workout, but it wasn't as comfortable as a bench would be. My suggestion is to try a ball and see how you feel. Balls fit nicely into small apartments or spaces (can be deflated if need be, though I don't) and benches unless they are the collapsible kind, take up space. Balls require balancing, however, and you may be better off with bench.

Then on to the lower body.  Rows, leg raises, back laterals and squats, extensions. Then floor work for thighs. This is very similar to a full gym workout, but done with simple dumbbells and a bench and that's about it. If you were in a gym, you'd use cables for the leg workout or leg machines. Then you finish off with various crunches.

The first half of the lower body workout is like the Fat Meltdown, except with extra squats. For those whose knees cannot take the pressure of squats, Joyce has leg extensions and leg curls for one of the video team. And she herself doesn't do full squats. Neither do I. There is wear and tear on the knees after time, so you must know your limits. I do half squats but if you are overly heavy or have knee damage, the leg extension and curls can be done on a bench and standing.

Here is a criticism; Joyce does not notice that Nina, who is the beginner participant in the video, is not in the correct position while doing the alternate exercise.  I think it would be better to have filmed Nina doing the curls and extensions correctly. Her effort also looked half-hearted in some cases. Even if Nina is a beginner, she can achieve correct form for a few reps on film. If you are getting into working out, Joyce Vedral's DVD's are VERY VERY GOOD. Beginners would do great with there. Make no mistake; these are really able to be done by relative beginners and then made more vigorous by simply upping the weights. But correct position is important. In once instance, Nina is doing curls and the exercise announced is leg extension (she's pulling her leg up and behind her, when she should be lifting her leg out in front of her.) This is going to confuse a beginner who needsto employ the variation Nina is doing. This should have been corrected.  I don't like confusion on exercise DVD's and this is why I knocked off a point. Especially as a beginner would be apt to do the leg extensions/curls rather than half or full squats to start off. I hope a new edition will correct this.

The leg workout, without the additional thigh work on the floor along with abs, is not all that different from the Fat Meltdown. So if you already have the Meltdown DVD, you might feel a bit disappointed. My recommendation is that if you find the Meltdown has gotten easy, moving on to the ""Cougar"" (that name!) is a way to up the exercise along with increasing weights. It is a longer workout. Give your Meltdown DVD to a friend or save it for days when instead of a half hour, you only have 18 minutes for a fast workout.

If you want to add a tougher workout to a basic fast-moving dumbbell aerobic weight workout, this is very good. You don't have to buy any additional equipment save heavier weights as you need them. There is no excuse and you need no gym membership. Though, if you've never lifted, I think a few sessions with a trainer, paying him or her to show you how to achieve good form is helpful.

Summary:

Rank beginners may want to start with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Speedy-Non-Stop-Fat-Meltdown-Workout/dp/B000R7I3UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Speedy Non-Stop Fat Meltdown Workout</a>&nbsp;because it is fast and nearly anyone can do it with light weights or even no weights at all. If you are wanting something longer, stronger and a bit more intense, and if you already have done the Meltdown, this workout is a good intermediate step to more intense working out such as Jillian Michaels or The Firm. I enjoyed it. It would be great for people getting back into exercise, or older ladies who need to get fit again, because this is not viciously difficult. If you are in mediocre shape, you might choose this workout over the Meltdown, as they are similar in many ways. (Actually, most weight workouts have a base that is similar, and you add certain exercises and more weights to make a more intense workout. Most of Joyce Vedral's workouts are quite similar as they are based on weight regimes.)

As always, check with your physician before starting an exercise regime.",1256688000,56,6487,4.807174887892376
3595648,5,B001G4V1SE,I own all of Joyce DVDs and this one is the best of them. She looks awesome at the age of 65. Very inspiring!,1254700800,11,109,3.5833333333333335
8303785,5,B001G4V1SE,"Awesome workout.  She chatters the whole time, but it is just kind of background noise.  I kind of like her Yankee accent, its neat (I'm a Southerner).  The work out is very fast paced and I like that.  Its very basic, no fancy music or setting - just the way I like it.  She does NOT show or discuss proper form.  You will have to already know that, otherwise you might hurt yourself. I use Jessica Smith workouts in the Winter when my husband and I don't want to take walks.  Jessica does explain the proper way to do dumbells.  I.e.  control the up and down - not flinging them about.  Not using your back to help lift, etc  If you do not know proper dumbell form, you need to research before you do this workout.",1526256000,,716,4.1911764705882355
8303786,5,B001G4V1SE,I love the Cougar Workout.  I've had many Joyce Vedral DVDs but this is my favorite.  One thing I really appreciate is that exercises are divided into standing and bench so you are not having to get up and down all the time.  Works especially well for me as I opted to use the floor instead of buying a bench.  I was having a lot of trouble with my arthritic knees.  Difficult to get down on the floor and nearly impossible to get off the floor without assistance.  My husband was also starting to complain about my posture.  I noticed a difference in my knees in about three weeks (all those half-squats paid off) and my posture has improved.  I used some health issues as an excuse to stop working out (I really hate exercise) and starting having knee pain again.  I started exercising with Joyce and the knee pain ended.  I hope I've learned my lesson.,1519516800,,855,4.388535031847134
8303787,5,B001G4V1SE,My husband and I have worked out for years with Joyce Vedral. I periodically do other workouts because I like change but my husband keeps at the same program and it has really improved his play as a softball player. We just purchased this a few days ago and have already started and it is amazing how the old school workouts are so much better at transforming your body A few weeks ago I started using another of Joyces workouts and within days My already toned stomach flattened even more. I love Joyce and her kooky sense of humour which helps as you are sweating like a pig.,1508025600,2,577,4.351851851851852

8303789,3,B001G4V1SE,"I enjoyed this video. The upper body was great and at a good pace.  For some reason, the back exercised were rushed at almost a double time pace.  I feel like it should be slower so you can better control your movements.  The same goes for the leg workout.",1493251200,2,256,4.183673469387755
