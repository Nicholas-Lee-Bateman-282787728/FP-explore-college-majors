I thought it was one of Arnold's best movies, in fact. I couldn't understand why it got such bad reviews.
Maybe they  missed the point of all the self-mocking sarcasm? Arnold got a chance to  relax and make some serious fun of himself and his image.
It's a great  fantasy, where a kid is sucked into the movie screen, into the world of his  favorite action hero movie star. And then he tries to convince the hero  that the hero's world is just a fiction in the movies.
Like, the hero  gets someone's phone number and the kid points out, so if this is all real,  then how come everybody's phone number starts with ""555""?
And  they're in a video store and they see a poster for a movie that starred  Arnold in real life. Only in the hero's world, it starred Sylvester  Stallone, and the hero says how much he loved Stallone's performance.
I  really think the naysayers just missed the whole point. It really stood up  to my 2nd viewing and I will check out the DVD version soon.",913939200,2,1071,4.326633165829146

11054,4,0767815335,I remember when I was a kid and this came out the same summer as Jurassiac Park which was a massive box office hit while this was considered a flop at the time. It's really to bad because it captures the action crazed movies of the eighties and early nineties so well. Some great moments and set pieces and I am huge Schwarzenegger fan so in my books he can do no wrong. The only one issue is the main character of the kid can get pretty annoying at times.

11078,3,0767815335,"The film itself is easily a 5 Star.. My opinion it's one of the most under-rated ridiculous action film parodies..  I gave it a 3 instead of 1 to be to the film, because as many have mentioned this is a half-assed poorly converted version of this film I have ever seen.. Not only because the rendering is a jerry rig to step up the quality but the sound as mention is not... well.. it's often muted in some spots while others it's extremely loud.. So if you crank up the volume to hear the faint sound of most of the dialogue the music and the gunshots might blow your speakers (exaggerating) BUT it is a very poor version of an otherwise great film. It's as if's mono sound.. It may be.",1507766400,3,687,4.204545454545454

11176,1,0767815335,"This review is on the quality of the high-definition print. As I wrote before on other bad quality Blu-rays, this is one of those you should avoid.
They did not re-digitize from the analog film, to get additional pixels for HD, and then print HD in real 2K resolution. They made a copy of the previous standard 1K definition DVD print, but it **doesn't have the additional 1K pixels**. So you think you're watching HD
content, but you don't. The same visible grain all over the screen as on DVD, the same resolution level of close-up detail.
Shame Columbia Pics, otherwise venerable company. However, they made a step forward and printed it in wide screen (previous DVD version was
shamefully full screen). For this reason I'll keep it. If you're looking to upgrade your Last Action Hero DVD to HD, I do not recommend this buy

11201,4,0767815335,"I'll confess that when I saw ""Last Action Hero"" in the theater, I hated it. It may have been because my expectation were for a shoot-'em up action flick, and as the film played out, I realized it was a comedy taking jabs at what was then my teenage self's favorite genre, I was irritated. More likely, it was because my brother and I went to see this at it's Midnight opening, and I was simply tired and cranky by the time the film started playing?! Either way, it wasn't a movie I revisited for quite some time. Flash ahead a few years, and I see it on the shelf at Blockbuster (remember those?...there's one in this movie even!) and decide to give it another viewing. Upon second viewing, I enjoyed the movie much more, and now it stands right up there with some of Schwarzenegger's best films.

The basic story is that a young boy is given a magic ticket, the ticket allows the boy to enter the latest film of his favorite action star Jack Slater. While helping Jack thwart crime in LA, he's also trying to convince Slater that they are both in a movie by pointing out things like one cop being an animated cat, or guns that never run out of bullets. Slater doesn't buy it, but when an evil henchman steals the ticket to come into the real world, it's up to Slater to stop him and get the ticket back.

11224,5,0767815335,"Do I really call ""Last Action Hero,"" a satire? Maybe not. Although it uses familiar action movie tropes in a satire-like way, I think if none if it is noticed, letting it be more ""wink-wink"" fun than a more serious statement (about how unrealistic movies are), it a great movie.

Sure, there are plenty of action movie cliches, like guns which never require reloading, heroes who are never seriously hurt, and characters who can do amazing physical things. And every bad line you can get into a movie is here. But it works.

The short synopsis:
Boy gets magic movie ticket and is unexpectedly pulled into a movie something like a modern Dirty Harry, landing in the car of the hero (Arnold). He knows parts of the plot other characters do not because he saw the first 10 minutes in third person objective. The movie characters believe they are real, but the boy knows otherwise. Eventually, the good and bad guys arrive in the real world.

So much of it is intentionally predictable. You don't mind. Arnold pokes fun at himself and other stars of the genre, drawing from plenty of cheesy motifs, puns and plot lines.

It is an older movie, but hasn't aged a bit. I fully recommend, ""Last Action Hero.""

Coming off the release of TERMINATOR, apparently it was just too early for Schwarzenegger to make a film making fun of himself.  This movie is a big, loud, uproarious spoof of action movies starring the undisputed king of action movies - what's not too like?  And for you Game of Thrones fans, don't miss Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) in a deliciously evil role.",1417219200,,462,4.897435897435898
11255,3,0767815335,"This is a review of the 2014 Blu-ray release.

I never understood why this movie didn't do better.  Perhaps because it didn't take itself seriously - it is, after all, an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies - so maybe we feel like we shouldn't take it seriously either.

Arnold by this time had well established himself as an action hero, indeed THE action hero to many.  But he had also starred in several successful comedies, such as Twins and Kindergarten Cop.  And while there is plenty of action in this movie, it is more a comedy than an action movie.  It is surprisingly (and refreshingly) self-aware in its analysis of the fictional reflection of our real world that exists only in the movies - sort of a modern-day Alice Through the Looking Glass.  Whether mocking that there are no ordinary-looking women in the movies, only gorgeous models; or the impossibility that all phone numbers begin with ""555"", this movie asks us to examine the holes in the fictional reality we are fed in the movie theater, rather than overlook them.  It is not often that we get a refreshingly honest script as this.

Unfortunately, this Blu-ray presentation leaves something to be desired.  The transfer is a bit soft, with weak blacks, and even some fuzzy blurring to the edge of the image in at least one scene (the last projection booth scene).  There are ZERO extras, (not even a trailer), and the menu consists of one choice - ""Play Movie"".  No soundtrack or subtitle options.  Obviously Columbia has not shown the love to this movie.  So, much as I regret it, this Blu-ray only gets 3 stars, due to the quality of the transfer.  However, don't let that dissuade you.  This really is a gem of a movie.",1417132800,13,1739,4.708609271523179

Audiences didn't expect a comedy when they went to see it and walked out angry. Columbia made the mistake of thinking Arnold could hold his own (and win) against competing picture Jurassic Park, which opening the same weekend (Arnold didn't fare well)

As for the DVD, I would recommend going the way of Mill Creek's recent re-release. This is mostly because Columbia's DVD is in full screen, which makes it undesirable. Mill Creek's DVD is in widescreen, the transfer is good, and the artwork is the original artwork (Columbia's wasn't). The only draw is the the DVD is even more bare-bones than Columbia, a fact I didn't think was possible. The menu has nothing but a play option. Either way, I would recommend this disc over Columbia's simply for the fact that it finally shows the film in widescreen, as it rightfully deserved.",1412812800,5,958,4.771084337349397

I don't know if it was the writing or acting, but i was left wanting a spin-off just with him! And Ian Mckellan was just sublime as a 'Bergman' Death.
But still, Arnie proves he's best at comedy; Terminator was O.K., but spoofing himself is where he seems most relaxed. I'm not an action movie kind of gal, per se, because I like some intelligence, thought and creativity in my entertainment---well this gave it in spades. Did I mention Charles Dance as Benedict?

11270,4,0767815335,"Last Action Hero is certainly not for everyone. To me, there is no truer evidence of this than when I saw it that fateful summer it was released (and completely overshadowed by Jurassic Park) and I left the theater in love with it, while my friends wondered if it was the stupidest Arnold movie they had ever seen. It was certainly unlike anything Arnold had been in before.

And this is the curse of Last Action Hero - an ironic twist on who Arnold was, a commentary on action genre, a love-letter to action movies, and completely self-referential as it embodied everything it was putting under the microscope. It was a movie too ironic and self referential for its time, and in 2014, it covers a topic that is a cloudy mystery to this generation, as the action hero (the Stallones and Arnolds) is something that doesn't exist as it did when this movie was made. So where does that leave Last Action Hero? Under appreciated? Romanticized? Probably a lot of both.

Now, with that out of the way, here is what Last Action Hero is to me: A fun, well-written summer movie that has a little extra depth, asks a few good questions about what we expect from movies. It's the 'Cabin In The Woods' of action movies. It's Hot Fuzz played out literally. Even the AV Club thinks it deserves a second look (http://www.avclub.com/article/whyi-last-action-heroi-failedand-why-it-deserves-t-105120)

Studio bosses at Columbia Pictures were convinced that Arnold Schwarzenegger would clobber the dinosaurs, and played up this battle of the box office behemoths in their promotion for the film. They were gravely mistaken. Arnold Schwarzenegger got stomped like Bambi under Godzilla's foot. I can recall going to a big multiplex with Steven Spielberg's film on five screens. Even in its second week, lines to see it went through the theatre lobby and out the door. In comparison, 'Last Action Hero' opened there on just a single screen with a half-empty auditorium. After a string of mega-hits including 'Total Recall' and 'Terminator 2,' the actor had his first outright flop. As a potential contender for the big summer blockbuster of the year, 'Last Action Hero' was simply not to be.

In hindsight, there was simply no way that any picture in its position could have ever succeeded. Not even the biggest film star in the world, which Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the time, could face off against the defining cultural moment for a generation of moviegoers and survive unscathed. However, bad timing was certainly not the film's only problem. Even if not for its box office competition, the movie's poor screenplay, inconsistent tone, and the irritating performance from one of its lead stars would have likely done it in anyway.

Somewhere during its development, 'Last Action Hero' started off as a [supposedly] clever idea, even metaphysical, high-concept pitch. The story works as a sort of reverse spin on Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo.' Life in the big city slums of New York hasn't been easy for young Danny Madigan [Austin O'Brien]. In between home invasions and muggings, the boy's only form of entertainment is to watch films at the run-down old theatre where he's befriended the doddering projectionist Nick [Robert Prosky] who owns his personal Cinema. Like most 12 year-olds, he has an enthusiasm for films but hasn't yet developed taste in them. His favourites are the mindless shoot-'em-ups starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, yes, the actor name-checks himself, as loose cannon cop Jack Slater. After one particularly bad day, his projectionist friend offers Danny Madigan a special advance screening of 'Jack Slater IV', all by himself at midnight. The boy jumps at the chance. When he arrives, he's also given a magic ticket said to be passed down from Harry Houdini. Danny Madigan is in hog heaven as he settles down to watch Jack Slater take revenge on the Mafioso, who killed his second-cousin.

Well, it turns out that the magic ticket really is magical. At a key moment, Danny Madigan is sucked into the theatre screen and passes right through into the world of the film itself. Against his disbelief, he's living in his favourite film, paired up as Jack Slater's newest partner. His attempts to explain the predicament to anyone and everyone in earshot are met with indifference. Now, Danny Madigan must find a way to get back to the real world. In the process, he'll have to help Jack Slater foil the Mob's latest scheme to take over Los Angeles.

It's [supposedly] a neat idea, and 'Last Action Hero' has a handful of funny scenes to support it. Early on, bored at school, Danny Madigan fantasises about Arnold Schwarzenegger taking over for Laurence Olivier in 'Hamlet' and blowing the hell out of Denmark. In Jack Slater's crazy celluloid universe, the L.A.P.D. is populated by all sorts of wacko cops in outlandish uniforms. Blink-and-you'll-miss-'em celebrity cameos pop up all over, like Sharon Stone as Catherine Trammel, Robert Patrick as the T-1000, and Danny DeVito as the voice of an animated cat detective, to name but a few. The film takes pot-shots at action film clichs like the crusty police captain, the hero's bad puns, the overly-talky killer, the cop killed with only two days to retirement, a chase through the oft-used L.A. River, and many ridiculous stunts and explosions. Arnold Schwarzenegger is plenty game to send-up his own persona and career. And the meta-filmic twists go into overdrive when the main villain Benedict [Charles Dance] who is delightfully creepy, escapes into the real world with a plot to disrupt the 'Jack Slater IV' premiere and kill the true Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Towards the end of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger appears as himself, attending the New York opening of his latest Jack Slater film, accompanied by his wife, Maria Shriver, and blithely unaware that Jack Slater is fighting for his life in another part of the theatre. Instead, Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen hustling the Jack Slater merchandise that, like the ""Last Action Hero"" T-shirts, caps and poster are being sold to promote the film.

Unfortunately, these things take up maybe 15 to 20 minutes of screen time in a 131-minute film. Whatever good ideas the original script may have held were eventually watered down through countless rewrites, studio interference, test screening feedback, and last-minute reshoots. Danny Madigan is an incredibly whiny and annoying lead character that engenders no audience sympathy at all. I can't blame poor Austin O'Brien too much; I'm sure the kid did exactly what everyone asked of him. The hiring of John McTiernan as the director, especially where he made his mark with 'Predator' and 'Die Hard,' also turned out to be a much bigger mistake than anyone realised. The director may be deft with the action stuff, but has no sense of comedy whatsoever. Far too many of the gags in the film are thudding unfunny. For long stretches of the film, everyone seems to forget that they're making a spoof of dumb action films, and instead just proceeds to make a dumb action film.

'Last Action Hero' is slightly overlong, and not nearly as funny, smart, or entertaining as it thinks it is. Sadly, everyone realised it. At $85 million, the film was quite expensive for its day and it cost more than 'Jurassic Park' did, and yet grossed a paltry $50 million domestically. It did better overseas, and I'm sure turned a profit eventually. But the vanity project is still remembered as a black mark in its star's career. On the other hand, 'Last Action Hero' is not quite the worthless disaster that it was made out to be at the time either. If you can go into it with low expectations, the picture is just moderately clever enough to be watchable. Just barely, though and set those expectations really low.

With his lantern jaw and square-cut, comic-book looks, Arnold Schwarzenegger handles his various roles with good humour: it is fun being the boss. Young Austin O'Brien is also a very slick performer. Note should be made of the contributions of Dean Semler, the director of photography; Eugenio Zanetti, the production designer, and Richard Greenberg, the visual effects consultant.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Considering its history on the very inferior DVD, 'Last Action Hero' looks surprisingly respectable on Blu-ray. The 1080p transfer is presented in the films correct 2.40:1 theatrical aspect ratio. The image is at least reasonably sharp enough that the small engraving on Arnold's belt buckle is legible. Black levels are solid and the contrast range appears to be properly rendered without artificial boosting. Colours are well saturated and sometimes striking. In another pleasant surprise, I didn't spot any edge enhancement artefacts. My initial expectation was that Sony would merely recycle their DVD master from 2001, and the studio's DVDs of the era were almost all plagued with edge ringing problems. Countering that, however, is some moderate but noticeable Digital Noise Reduction filtering that does give the transfer a dated appearance. This causes occasional smearing during motion, and frozen grain patterns. Grain representation in general is a problem with the disc. The movie's photography is fairly grainy in spots, especially during special effects shots. The high-definition transfer doesn't handle the grain very well. It looks very noisy and even blocky at times, which suggests either poor digitalisation during the telecine transfer or poor compression during the disc encoding.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  In similar respects, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is decent all around, but not quite exceptional. 'Last Action Hero' had the distinction of being the first movie released theatrically in the SDDS 7.1 audio format, Sony's competition for Dolby Digital and DTS. The latter debuted a week earlier with 'Jurassic Park' and stole most of Sony's thunder. Many of the theatres equipped with SDDS experienced technical problems; for several years, and the format was referred to as a complete failure. In order to show off their 7.1 channels, the film's mixers loaded up the soundtrack with lots of zinging directional and surround activity. Bullets whiz all through the soundstage repeatedly. Even as mixed down to 5.1 channels here, the track is still very aggressive. It also matrixes well into 7.1 configuration with Dolby ProLogic IIx processing. Overall fidelity is pretty good. The rockin' score and songs on the soundtrack are satisfyingly broad across the front channels. Sound effects such as knives are quite sharp and piercing. Gun fire has a nice kick. Dynamic range is a little on the shallow side. The movie has plenty of explosions, but few of them dig particularly deep. In baseball terms, this would be a solid double.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Just like earlier DVD editions of this film, the Blu-ray has no bonus features. Unless you count a bunch of trailers that are not very relevant, which is to my mind, a complete waste of a Blu-ray disc.

Finally, film for film and despite a couple of misfires in an otherwise exemplary rsum, there was at one point nobody better in the Action movie business than John McTiernan, and after a string of cranking out three of the most successful Action films of all time, the Director proved himself abundantly capable of delivering what was and still arguably is the quintessential Action spoof film in Last Action Hero. Starring history's biggest Action hero and delivering a fun and magical plot that perfectly intermixes general parody of the Action movie business, Last Action Hero makes for an infinitely re-watchable picture for Action and Arnold Schwarzenegger fans alike. Sony's Blu-ray release, however, is rather tepid, featuring a fairly decent 1080p picture quality, a booming lossless soundtrack, and next to no extras. Recommended for diehard fans of the film, but for more casual viewers should wait for, hopefully a special edition at some point in the future will be released, I hope so. Despite it being slightly a disappointing film, that should have been better, I am still glad I have got this in my Blu-ray Collection, as I am really keen to build up an extensive Arnold Schwarzenegger Blu-ray Collection.

Arnold was not known for that... So Damn.... this movie actually has it both... it HAS IT ALL.. Great Action and Great Sci-Fi Story / writing... and He's great do it.. ""both of him:"" not to give it away...

11289,3,0767815335,"This film may be a tribute to all things action in Hollywood, but there were some other things worth enjoying.  Right from the start, I wish that there had been more of Danny Devito as the cartoon cat, but that may just be because I'm a Danny Devito fan...Arnold just doesn't do it for me.  The ridiculous nature of the ""action movie"" was quite enjoyable (sadly, action movies in our world aren't that far off) and the villain, played by Charles Dance, didn't quite stray into an area that I like to refer to as ""stereotypical creepy"".  I enjoyed the satirical elements of this film, though I stop and wonder how the makers of real action films come up with some of their stuff.  I mean, I thought all the satire was right on the money, so have action movies really strayed so much?  Anyway, I found the leading lad, Austin O'Brien, okay, though he seemed to stray from whining to annoyingly over-confident the whole time, neither of which are appealing traits for me.  I actually found Robert Prosky as the theatre attendant more interesting...Danny Devito still wins though.  Overall, this was the perfect film for Arnold Schwarzenegger as it basically poked fun at what he did best while allowing him to continue doing it.  It's good for a laugh, especially at the action movies it's making fun of.  Enjoy.",1401667200,,1309,4.656521739130435

11295,5,0767815335,"During the better half of 1980's and 1990's, action movies were huge, and even that can be considered a vast understatement. Full of explosions, cheesy one liners, and over the top characterizations, this genre was just BEGGING for a parody. While ""Hot Shots! Part Deux"" did an admirable job, Last Action Hero is the absolute ""last word"" on the subject of ""action movie parodies"" as it takes an already takes an established ""beefcake"" action star like good ol' Arnie and thrusts him into the spotlight as the mega-hit cop hero, Jack Slater.

The film centers around a delinquent kid named Danny who skips school constantly so he can watch movies (namely Jack Slater Films) in a rundown theater run by a kindly old man. The old timer offers to show Danny an advance screening of the latest Jack Slater film provided he attends school. And he does so after being mugged in his own home and having day dreams of Arnold (who also plays himself along with Jack Slater) starring in a much more action oriented version of the film adaptation of Hamlet during class. When Danny arrives at the cineplex, he's given a magical ticket by the old man who says that it was given to him by Harry Houdini. Later on, while Danny is enjoying the movie, the ticket sparkles and he's instantly thrust into the celluloid world of Jack Slater who's hot on the case of Tony Vivaldi. And jesus, this film plays ""homage"" to so many action film tropes that it is quite honestly INSANE. Cops dying three days before retirement, the henchmen double crossing his incompetent boss. the hero getting his badge revoked during an important case, etc, etc, etc

The tropes are openly mocked as well as celebrated and I feel is the biggest underlying theme of this movie: the celebration, not mockery, of action movies. And what's strange is how many people see Arnold's other film ""Commando"" (1985) as a parody movie (namely Doug Walker, alias ""The Nostalgia Critic"") and view ""Last Action Hero"" as some shlocky mess of a film that can only be laughed at ""ironically"".

Bottom line: If you like Action Movies and a good bit of satire, get Last Action Hero",1395878400,,2121,4.696236559139785

11298,5,0767815335,"Granted, LAST ACTION HERO (1993)  is probably aimed at pre-teen boys, yet it's a personal favorite. I'm one of this film's loyal fans.

At the time it was making the theatrical rounds I worked at Sears Brand Central in their electronics division. We had a dedicated laser disc player that repeated every 30 minutes a selection of movie promos, plus Sears and other commercials. These discs were changed monthly.

For a couple of cycles, ""Last Action Hero"" was a featured item. The ad included some fine concert footage of AC/DC's ""Big Gun."" A portion of this track opens the picture's final credit scroll. Arnold appears in character during the Sears video while Angus Young does his famous schoolboy prance on stage.

The soundtrack of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LAST-ACTION-HERO/dp/B00000297D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LAST ACTION HERO</a>&nbsp;is a metal or rocker fan's delight. It includes cuts by Alice in Chains, Megadeath, Fishbone, Def Leppard, Anthrax, Cypress Hill, Queensryche and Aerosmith. Tesla has the title track.

The reason I'm particularly fond of this one is its references to classic movies, including Hamlet, in a fab b&w scene where Arnold as a grungy machine gun packing Dane says, ""To be or not to be"" and lights a bomb off his stogie. He tosses the TNT. Big explosion behind him and then a drolly given, ""Not to be"" ends the sequence.

Best of all is Ian McKellen's take on the Grim Reaper from Ingmar Bergman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-SEVENTH-SEAL/dp/B001WLMOL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE SEVENTH SEAL</a>&nbsp;(1957). Honorable mention to Tom Noonan's horribly scarred axe-wielding villain. He and Arnold play dual roles: themselves the actors and their action film characters.

It's a great concept: young Austin O'Brien (as Danny Madigan) steps into a movie and then he and other fictional characters cross back into the real world. That L.A. police station on the other side of the screen is great. We also get a holographic glimpse here of Arnold's Terminator foe in cop drag, and Danny DeVito provides the voice of 'Whiskers,' a cartoon cat detective. Also here, Austin/Danny I.D.s a confused F. Murray Abraham as Mozart's killer (remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AMADEUS/dp/B00006DEFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AMADEUS</a>?).

At the video store, Sylvester Stallone is seen on a lifesize cardboard stand up display as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-TERMINATOR/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE TERMINATOR</a>. Jack Slater (Arnold) raves about how good Sly is in the role to a shocked Danny. It's too funny! Oh, and other bad puns, like when Slater kills a villain with an ice cream stuck in the eyeball, he quips: ""Iced that guy... to cone a phrase!""

11345,4,0767815335,"This movie was billed as an action flick during its theater release, which was a mistake. Audiences were expecting exactly that, and the movie is something entirely different: it's a comedy, and a clever one, at that.

Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger) is the favorite action hero of young movie buff, Danny Madigan. A magic movie ticket and a wrinkle in reality transport Danny into Slater's world, where car chases are a daily event and Slater's never-before-seen police partner turns out to be a cartoon cat named Whiskers. Slater and Danny fight crime while dodging action-movie cliches right and left. Then, in a nod to meta, they hunt down a Slater-world villain who has crossed into the real world and is attempting to defeat Slater once and for all by killing the actor who portrays him.

The movie doesn't just mock the cliches of its genre, it mocks movies themselves. Slater's closet only contains identical versions of the same clothes he's already wearing. The police captain's unintelligible scolding is revealed to be exactly that: even up close and in person, you still can't tell exactly what he's saying.

Slater is forced to realize that he and his world (where all phone numbers start with 555) are fictional. He immediately becomes angry about all the stresses and hardships he's suffered at the all-too-casual whims of writers.

There are lots of great details in this movie (the daydreamed Jack Slater version of ""Hamlet"" is priceless), and several talented character actors: Mercedes Ruehl, Charles Dance, Robert Prosky, and F. Murray Abraham all make appearances here.

If you like irony and satire, this movie is definitely worth seeing. Here's hoping it finds the right audience on DVD, now that the studio has stopped trying to pass it off as something different from what it actually is.",1309737600,5,1811,5.023333333333333
11346,3,0767815335,"Considered to be one of the biggest summer disappointments of 1993, Last Action Hero tried to get its name out there by being the next big name action flick, and it sure did disappoint many. Here's a thing to keep in mind though: this is actually a PARODY of the action genre that just happens to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It's not trying to be a replica of the big names such as Terminator, Predator, or even Commando (which was unintentionally hilarious, by the way). Instead, it's an inside joke in the style of a sketch comedy skit, except it's drawn out much longer. While I personally don't think that Last Action Hero is terrible by any means, it doesn't mean that's it flawless.

Arnold manages to play two characters in this film: the far more present cinematic world character Jack Slater, and the real life version of himself. He is obviously the reason why you would want to see this movie, and throughout the film, he makes fun of his stereotypical character by using over-the-top one liners and using unorthodox methods of action scenes. There's some hilarious jokes that he says throughout, and along with him, we even manage to see other film icons playing some of their trademark parts, including Robert Patrick dressed up as the T-1000, Sharon Stone's role as Catherine Tramell, and one of my personal favorites, Sylvester Stallone as The Terminator on a cardboard cutout. While I do enjoy the comedic, over-the-top bits that obviously point out the Hollywood cliches, this film suffers from drawing these out too long amongst its script. Sometimes they tend to be unnecessary and at others rather boring.

Also, I found the child protagonist played by Austin O'Brien to be rather annoying. Part of me thinks that they used the idea of him teaming up with Schwarzy from T2, where Edward Furlong was the child protagonist. While Furlong was clever, funny and acted well, O'Brien tries too hard to be a mastermind behind the typical action film. I understand that the role of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.

In a way, I tend to find Last Action Hero to be an enjoyable popcorn flick that tried something new by being a hidden parody. It was a major risk for director John McTiernan, screenwriter Shane Black (who ironically rewrote the script despite Zak Penn and Adam Leff having it a tongue-in-cheek reference to Black's style), and Arnold, but as a parody, it works. It's just a far cry from what we would expect from a cast like aforementioned.",1307232000,3,2674,4.721627408993576

11351,4,0767815335,"It's sad to think that 18 years after its release Last Action Hero is still trying to find its target audience. Audiences don't like smart movies. Or perhaps I should say audiences don't like to be OUTSMARTED by movies. In the summer of 1993 the world was going crazy for a certain dinosaur movie, almost everything else didn't stand a chance. LAH came out a week after Jurassic Park. The only people who really went to see it were those who were too late for sold-out screenings of Spielberg's movie. Bad word of mouth spread for many reasons.

Those lucky enough to actually see it on the big screen walked away confused and disorientated. They thought they were in for a straight-up action movie, not an existential, meta-fictional parody of the genre they cherish. It was just too much and they weren't ready for it. Arnold had been riding the wave of Total Recall and Terminator 2 before the release of Last Action Hero, no one expected such a radical deviation from the norm.

Danny Madigan is a lonely kid living in a tiny New York apartment with his single MILF. His only friend is Nick, an old-time projectionist at a run down theater (a REAL theater, no multiplex nonsense). Danny likes to escape into the world of action movies, his biggest hero, obviously, being Arnie himself. The latest Arnie blockbuster, the simply-titled Jack Slater IV, is a day away from its premiere, and old Nick has been tasked with checking the print. Before Danny sits down for his own personal pre-premiere midnight screening Nick gives him a magical ticket he's been saving since childhood. Five minutes after Jack Slater IV begins Danny is warped into the cinema screen and becomes part of the movie.

In the movie world Danny quickly learns that the laws of physics and simple logic don't apply (how often has THAT proven to be true?). He's partnered with Slater, a renegade L.A. cop and the absolute zenith of action hero stereotypes, to find who killed his favorite second-cousin Frank (BIG MISTAKE!). Danny and Slater smash their way into a hokey, James Bond-ish plot, though it's not long before suave English henchman Mr. Benedict discovers Danny's secret and plans to escape to the real world. Danny and Slater follow, but Slater's movie-world abilities are rendered useless in reality. Doubt begins seep in for the first time as he ends up questioning his powers as a good cop.

Last Action Hero scores huge points all round. It's technically wonderful, with gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography full of wide angles and lens flares. The writing is sharp is funny. Arnie is great as an infallible hero in crisis as well as making fun of his screen persona. And the action, both fictional and meta-fictional, is wild, overblown, and exciting. I just love Slater's huge fall from the elevator.

It's interesting to note that it has a lot in common with Loaded Weapon, which came out earlier that year. Both are send-ups of the 'L.A. cop movie' genre, both star F. Murray Abraham in supporting roles. Both feature Frank McRae as a screaming Lieutenant. Both have obvious Die Hard references (also directed by the infamous John McTiernan).

The bad reputation is unjustified. The financial loss was a mistake entirely on Sony's part and their lack of foresight into the 1993 summer season. Last Action Hero and Jurassic Park went head-to-head with their advertising but the dinosaur movie's marketing campaign was just too groundbreaking. They also competed with each other on a technical level. JP was the first film to feature DTS sound, while Last Action Hero was the first to feature SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound), an eight-channel system that delivers every decibel of Slater's big gun and the multiple explosions of his daily life.

It may be a satire, but Last Action Hero just may be one of the last true action films. Real stunts, real explosions, real destruction, reality gone twisted. It's Arnold's most subversive movie, and it's many things, but bad ain't one of them.

The Blu Ray features a great 2.35:1 1080p picture with a loud DTS HD-MA soundtrack. Zero extras are included. Sony seems to still be ashamed of the film. The hate is not deserved.",1296432000,83,4169,4.853727144866386

11355,4,0767815335,"Like a large percentage of Arnold Schwarzenegger's work, this is a film with a strong fantasy/altered reality element to it that works quite well overall, despite at times seeming too beholden to action formulae, rather than being willing to take the fantastic risks it looks like it's going to.  John McTiernan's 1993 LAST ACTION HERO was roundly criticized at the time of its release for being overblown and not delivering the goods that were expected from a $70-90 million (a lot of money at the time) film.  It came in the wake of TERMINATOR II, a hard act to follow certainly, and also just after McTiernan's financially disappointing MEDICINE MAN - but with his big hit THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER still reasonably fresh.  More importantly, the director had gotten his big break with PREDATOR, which was an important step in Arnold's rise to superstardom; this was their first (and to date only) reteaming.  I suppose expectations were higher than any film could deliver, and when the film failed to ignite either critics or the box office (to be fair, it was always in the mighty shadow of JURASSIC PARK), the word ""flop"" started to get bandied about, and the cynics started to wonder of the star's decade of dominance was coming to an end.

The naysayers were partly right; this was the first sign of Arnold faltering, though it would take another five years before he really started to lose his lustre; and it wasn't his best film by a long shot, though it certainly looks pretty good now in comparison with some of his later, even more expensive and less successful outings like END OF DAYS.  Basically the idea here is that we start off watching ""Jack Slater III"", an Arnold Schwarzenegger cop film in a sort of alternate reality that's pretty close to ours, and then our eventual sidekick character, an adolescent kid named Danny (Austin O'Brien) is revealed as watching the flick in a crumbling and decrepit old NYC movie palace.  The early scenes here are very evocative - Danny is watching the film alone, friends with the old projectionist Nick (Robert Prosky), and his mother (Mercedes Ruehl) worries about him skipping school and only being interested in movies and hanging out with the weird old guy.  Very Zemeckis-Spielberg.  But soon we're in different territory as Nick gives Danny a ""magic ticket"" that he got from Houdini himself, tearing it and releasing the magic that allows Danny to be catapulted into the movie world of Jack Slater (now starring in the 4th installment of the franchise, brand-new and not even officially premiered yet).

So the ""real world"" kid falls in with the completely fake Slater, who is of course unaware that he's a movie character.  There are some pretty good jokes early on - Slater's boss, the blustery Lt Dekker (Frank McRae) gets so angry and abusive if his regular berating of Slater that he becomes completely incomprehensible; Slater never runs out of bullets and never hurts himself; there are cameos from several costars of Arnold's from previous films; cartoon characters work as cops; etc.  But the satire on action movie conventions is fitful and often seems to be used just to fill in the blanks between ""real"" action sequences, and the developing friendship between Danny and Jack, while sweet, just doesn't feel as significant as it should.  Perhaps a Spielberg would have made it too shmaltzy, but here you're left wondering just how Danny really feels about the whole experience once it's over.

Charles Dance does a great one-eyed villain (with a different glass eye for every occasion) and Tom Noonan plays the other villain, something of a slasher-movie type monster called ""Ripper"".  Anthony Quinn is around as a bit as Dance's employer who stupidly keeps making idiomatic malapropisms in the manner of Biff in Back to the Future; we know his minutes are numbered from the get-go.  Art Carney has a nice little cameo as Slater's ""favorite second cousin"" and Bridgette Wilson is there to lend some serious hotness.  There are some nice little specific movie references - Olivier's Hamlet transformed into Jack Slater's (""to be, or not to be...not to be"" as he blows up the castle behind him) and Ian McKellen doing Bergman's death - but overall the satire is outweighed by action setpieces, and the film has a rather slapped-together feel to it, unsure as to what to do other than lumber towards a big splashy finish.

Still, it's mostly fun, and I have to say that I wasn't as bothered by O'Brien as I was on seeing it when new.  I think Arnie was fairly into it also, and that's important.  Probably average for his ouevre, and for all it's faults, another reminder as to why he really was not just the biggest but the best American action star of his era: he had the best talent around him, and he rarely seemed to take his image as seriously as people like Seagal, Stallone and Norris did.",1277510400,2,4866,4.790919952210275

At the time it was making the theatrical rounds I worked at Sears Brand Central in their electronics division. We had a dedicated laser disc player that repeated every 30 minutes a selection of movie promos, plus Sears and other commercials. These discs were changed monthly.

When his best friend, Nick the projectionist, gives him a magic ticket to the newest Jack Slater film, Danny is transported into Slater's world, his number one hero where the good guys always win. It's a dream come true for Danny, but things take a turn for the worst when one of Slater's enemies, Benedict the hitman, gets a hold of the ticket and ends up in Danny's world, where he realizes that if he can kill Arnold Schwarzenegger, then Slater will be no more. Slater and Danny must join forces and travel back and stop him at all costs before it'll be the end of Jack Slater. This movie is one of my favorite Arnold movies, because of it's boldness, and the fact that Arnold can be really funny when he wants to be.

11361,4,0767815335,"What happens when an action movie crosses over into the real world? That's the question explored in the early '90s cult action flick, Last Action Hero.

Young Danny (Austin O'Brian) spends his time watching cheesy action flicks, particularly those by action star Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger). When an old projectionist gives Danny a magical ticket, Danny is transported into one of Jack's movies where the laws of physics (or reality) don't have much meaning. It seems like the perfect world for Danny until Jack's nemesis (Charles Dance) finds the magic ticket and enters into the real world. It's up to Danny and Jack to stop him, but without the luxury of movie magic.

While many action movie fans (such as myself) will enjoy the cult nature of this movie, others will find it too corny and tongue-and-cheek. Last Action Hero, while expertly written and executed, is a parody of itself and of all (especially '80s) action movies, but in taking this route, has used too many ""in"" jokes. In fact, a few of the jokes even had to be explained to me, because I didn't understand all the little nuances of the screenplay. I can easily understand why some viewers won't enjoy the film's style of humor, but I can also see how it became a cult classic.

The picture quality is absolutely phenomenal. It's so crisp and clear that, quality-size, it feels like a modern movie. The colors are so vivid that the film feels like it's jumping off the screen (almost literally, making the nature of the movie itself even more interesting). I've never seen this film (okay, so I missed the DVD version and only saw the VHS version) ever presented in such a beautiful way before.

The sound has also been improved, and instead of having to turn the volume way up in order to hear anything outside of the action sequences, it was considerably more manageable. Between the picture and the sound, all of the over-the-top, corny action sequences really came to life here and made me feel like I was part of the action (which seems to be a key aspect of the movie's original intent). Presented in crystal-clear 1080p high definition in 2.40:1 widescreen, this is the best quality Last Action Hero can ever have. This edition also has Spanish, French, and Portuguese audio as well as English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese subtitles.

However, I found the bonus material here (or lack thereof) very disappointing. Now, since I've only see this movie before on VHS, I don't know what was included on the original DVD release (if anything), but I was hoping for a little more in this version of the movie aside from just gorgeous sound and impeccable visuals. Instead, Last Action Hero on Blu-ray features Movie IQ, which allows for semi-annoying (if you haven't seen the movie a few times before) pop-ups that give interesting information about the film, and Blu Live, which seems to be a common feature among all Blu-ray movies meant to direct viewers to Sony's online store. There's no deleted scenes or outtakes (my personal favorite extras) or even interviews with cast and/or crew. While I understand that since this an older movie and keeping up with extra features was very different then, you would think that they could have come up with something.

It's difficult to say whether or not the Blu-ray edition of Last Action Hero is worth it, especially with the serious lack of bonus features and the relatively high price tag associated with Blu-ray disks. If you are looking for flawless video and audio quality, then the Blu-ray is the perfect choice, but if you're looking for new material, then save your money and check out the DVD (or even VHS) version of the movie.",1265241600,9,3668,4.795886075949367
11362,3,0767815335,"A year after Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", in 1993, he followed up with the summer action film ""Last Action Hero"".

The film was directed by John McTiernan (""Die Hard: With a Vengeance"", ""The 13th Warrior"", ""The Thomas Crown Affair"") and a screenplay by Shane Black (""Lethal Weapon"" films, ""The Monster Squad"", ""The Last Boy Scout"") and David Arnot (""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane"").  The film featured cinematography by Dean Semler (""Bruce Almighty"", ""The Alamo"", ""The Longest Yard"", ""2012') and music by Michael Kamen (""X-Men"", ""Band of Brothers"", ""Frequency)"".

An expensive film which cost around $85 million, the film was literally a spoof on action films and would feature cameos from many stars around that time.  From Sharon Stone, Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ian McKellen, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick and many more.

The film revolves around a boy named Danny Madigan (played by Austin O'Brien) who is a big fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, especially his character Jack Slater.

The problem with Danny is that he rarely goes to school and it's become a problem since he spends his time watching movies and his mother covers up for him.

With the release of ""Jack Slater IV"", his friend Nick (played by Robert Prosky) who runs a very old rundown movie theater that is not doing so well, Jack gives him a sneak preview to catch the movie.  Nick also talks about how he was given a gold-ticket by Harry Houdini but never used it.

Nick tears the ticket in half and gives Danny the other half and as Danny is getting involved and enjoying the film, the ticket starts to magically work and next thing you know, Danny is inside the film for ""Jack Slater IV"" and in this world, things work like the movies and not real life.

As the film progresses and Danny sticks with Jack Slater and the two take on the bad guys which include the evil Englishman Benedict (played by Charles Dance).  But somehow along the way, Benedict steals Danny's ticket and has now cross over to the real world where Danny has come from.

In the real world, Benedict starts to learn that bad guys can win and starts killing people and noticing that the police are not there to stop him.  So, Benedict comes up with an idea to stop Jack Slater and that is by killing off the real actor that plays him...Arnold Schwarznegger.

Can Jack Slater and Danny stop Benedict in time?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Last Action Hero"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has given this film a pretty good treatment as they have with ""Cliffhanger"" and ""Air Force One"" in which they kept the film as close to what we see on the big screen, including the fine layer of grain.

For a film that is 17-years-old, the film looks good for its age and because there is so much happening throughout the film.  For example, in Danny's world, you can see how run down the theater is, old-style seats and everything is dark and there aren't any vibrant colors.  Until he goes into Jack Slater's world, then colors are vibrant and much better visuals.  Definitely a major improvement from the 2003 DVD of ""Last Action Hero"".

Now, where this film shines is with its lossless audio soundtrack.  Featured in English, French, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1, one thing that ""Last Action Hero"" had when it was first released in theaters was the fact it was the first film to utilize Sony's Dynamic Digital Sound.  Granted, at that time, many theaters weren't equipped to play SDDS but there was concentration on the film's audio and that is where this Blu-ray shines.

The opening sequence alone shows you that the film is going to utilize all channels and thus bringing a more immersive soundscape as you hear gun shots, explosions, crashing metal, booms all through your front, surround and rear surround channels.  Subwoofer utilizes the booms and for the most part, this is the best I have ever heard from this film.  The lossless audio soundtrack for this 1993 film is very well-done!

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Last Action Hero"" comes with no major special features but is BD-Live enabled with movieIQ which allows people to obtain real-time information of the cast, music, trivia while watching the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When ""Last Action Hero"" first came out and when I watched in the theaters, I figured a pairing with director John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarznegger (known for their action films) would be a wonderful pairing.  But I can remember how impatient I was getting because the film seemed so long (especially at 131 minutes).  I felt that the arc where Danny is in Jack Slater's world tend to drag quite a bit.

But I admit that I enjoyed how it was a satire of action films and also featured cameos by many celebrities.  By the third and final arc, things started to get more interesting as Jack Slater is pulled out of his magical world and now having to deal with this new world that he is quite unaware of.  For the most part, ""Last Action Hero"" was a good popcorn flick but I do remember that since it came right after ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", there was high expectations.

Needless to say, despite what the critics may have felt about the film, ""Last Action Hero"" did well in the worldwide box office and even some appreciating the film much more now than when it first came out in theaters back in 1993.

For those who purchased the 2003 DVD and are big fans of the film, you maybe wondering if the Blu-ray is worth buying.  The bad news is that there are no special features on this Blu-ray unless you have BD-Live and you can take advantage of the movieIQ function.  But other than that, I'm still amazed that for a film that was quite expensive, featured so many talent did not have any featurette created for it.  No commentary, no theatrical trailer, there is no special features and to me, that's surprising.  But the Blu-ray is a major step up in picture and audio quality and that is where fans of the film will appreciate its HD release on Blu-ray.

Overall, ""Last Action Hero"" on Blu-ray is literally a barebones Blu-ray release but for Schwarzenegger or McTiernan fans and those who truly enjoyed this film will definitely enjoy it much more with its video and audio upgrade.",1264464000,4,6336,4.731329690346084

I actually have the regular DVD edition from the UK which as
1)theatrical trailer
2)a featurette
3) music video featuring AC/DC and Arnold

all fun bonus features and NOT  on the Blu-Ray?

I've deducted a star for the fact that they've delivered a 'bare bones' Blu-ray and besides the ability to carry higher resolution one of the benefits of Blu-Ray is the bigger storage so there is not excuse for having elminated bonus features already produced?

11364,5,0767815335,"Any negative review on this movie was made by someone who I guess just didn't get it. Sure the pan&scan sucks, so watch it in widescreen. And Danny can get a little annoying at times, but the humor well makes up for it. This movie not only has an interesting premise, but its a satire on the whole action movie genre. Danny telling Jack he can't die until the grosses go down is gold, and if you don't agree then you have no comedic insight whatsoever and this movie is not for you. Other little things as well, Jack's great action hero cliche one-liners, Danny trying to point out to Jack that its impossible for every number in LA to start with 555-, that there are no regular or unattractive women there, or that Jack shouldn't trust Practice since he was a bad guy in Amadeus. If you understand the way movies are, then the comedy in Last Action Hero will leave you laughing the whole way through. I believe this movie is completely underrated, and a big reason I think it tanked at the box office, aside from its humor not being appreciated or completely understood, is everyone went to see Jurassic Park which came out at the same time. Think of the horrible satires we have today: Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans. All of which aren't worth the plastic case they come in. But with satires being so popular now, if this movie were to have come out in theaters now I believe it would have done phenomenal. Definitely worth the watch.",1262908800,7,1451,4.458646616541353

While in the movie the boy sees first hand that what happens in movies is completely unrealistic.  When Schwarzenegger and the boy get pulled form the movie into real life, the opposite occurs and Schwarzenegger gets to see the real life is not like the movies.  If you get shot, you get hurt and might die.  If you shoot your gun at a car it doesn't explode.  If you punch a window, it actually hurts.  And women in real life?  Well, they're not all super models.  Etc.

For years we have been blessed with so many laughs and enjoyment from our bulky headed California governor that we felt the need to get another one of his films in. At this point the pickings are very slim since we pounded away at the Arnold market for a year straight in 07. However we were reminded that Last Action Hero still lies in wait and luckily our friend on-demand just happened to have it available.

Our film starts off with young Arnold movie obsessed Danny Madigan as he hangs around at his local movie theater. He's a regular and has befriended the boss from Mrs. Doubtfire who moonlights as the theater owner, who invites Danny to a secret midnight screening of the new Jack Slater movie. Sounds a bit to catch a predator sketchy but the old man checks out and was not just ""some old guy wanting to perv you out."" Somehow the ticket Danny receives is magic and transports him into the back of Arnold caddie. From there he tags along everywhere in a world where the movies are a reality.

Unfortunately Sid was on the cusp of quite a nerve racking situation thanks to the real life 40 year old virgin and couldn't enjoy Last Action Hero quite as much as we wanted.

Im one of those few people who got the joke. I got the joke back in 1993 when it came out. I know that this movie was meant to spoof those absurd action movies. Its these bonehead cookie-cutter critics that don't get that point. Bunch of pinheads keep saying the same thing because they allow weirdos  to dictate to them what qualifies as quality movies. Check out the negative reviews on this site. They all go along the lines of ""worst movie I've ever seen"". Simple-minded predictable sheep. And now....... the review.

Premise: Daniel(Austin O'Brien) gets a magic ticket from a movie store owner given to him by Houdini. While watching the latest Jack Slater movie, Daniel gets transported into the movie itself and ends up joining Jack Slater(played by Arnold) in his crazy adventures. This particular adventure involves Jack finding out the killer of his brother.

Opinion: There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and very little bad things to say about this movie. The action is plentiful and the sets look great. That kid is annoying little wimp though(I must have watched this movie 10 times and still find that kid insufferable). The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! Plus he is a major wimp. You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks and compared to the rubbish that passes for parody now(Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans etc)it holds up well after all these years.

I'll leave you on this note: Not every movie that bombs at the box office is bad and not every movie that succeeds in the box office is good. There are plenty of movies that failed at the box office that are good and there are some movies that succeeded at the box office that stink to high heaven.

I am one of the people who grew up watching this movie. Overall this is actually a good action film. Anyone who doesn't like it, obviously didn't get that it was meant to be a satire of all the typical, cliches of action films.

John McTiernan, whether or not it was his approach, knew that the only way to truly satirize something, you must be as close to the subject matter as possible. Although he directed such great action films as Die Hard, Predator and The Hunt For Red October, he still manages to pull off his style and being true to the genre, while still managing to turn out a smart parody.

I am one for urging Sony Pictures to release an anniversary edition of this film, to be represented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and having a DTS mix in it as well. All fans of the film at least deserve that much. along with some interesting new special features with more then just a trailer.",1238976000,,1062,5.0227272727272725
11371,3,0767815335,"This movie has such a clever plot that never quite lives up to its potential, but does provide a few laughs and smiles along the way.

I saw this movie in the theater when I was the same age as the young protagonist and I thought it was awesome! My how things have changed since those carefree days when a million cameos and lots of explosions could make up for terrible writing and weak direction.

The Good: Tom Noonan as The Ripper is genuinely creepy and makes a great arch-foe for our Hero.  Jack Slater is a character with hilarious moments, especially when he calls himself, ""Arnold Groundschmuger, the famous comedian"". The spoof on the action genre is much funnier in retrospect than at the time of the film's release. Bridgette Wilson in cut-off jean shorts, 'nuff said.

The Bad: Danny Madigan goes from being cute to annoying so many times it makes you wish Benedict would just shoot him already.  Once the movie crosses over into the real world and Jack's ""crisis"" with being a fictional character the movie loses its focus and gets to wrapped up in whatever moral it failed to get across to the audience.

I would be willing to own this movie for the first hours worth of fun and comedy if not for the terrible pan & scan work that was done on the transfer (and I'm not shelling out $27.00 for the widescreen version).

Opinion: There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and a few bad things to say about this movie. The action is plentiful and the sets look great. That kid is annoying little wimp though. The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc)as well as misses(Slater's daughter screaming like an idiot while thrashing a bad guy in her room and the cartoon police cat WTF?). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks.",1209427200,4,1459,4.607692307692307

It's one of Arnold's better movies, along with Predator and T2. The whole concept of a boy with a magic ticket that allows mixing of both real world and fictional cinema world is brilliant. The writers covered all the major bases on this one. It's a movie I can just sit down, relax and watch over and over again. And really, it's the perfect capper to the whole 80's generation of quality, fun action movies. It's a tribute sealed with a kiss and a hell of a good time.

Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in his over-the-top performance as the perfect matinee-idol, Jack Slater. His biggest fan, Danny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) receives the chance of a lifetime to meet his fictional hero, through a magic ticket that transports him inside a Slater movie.

But the movie villain swipes the ticket and escapes into the real world. Slater and Danny must stop the crook by traveling back to reality, where the bad guys are not scripted to lose in the ""closing"" scene.

Directed by John McTiernan and featuring a great cast - F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Anthony Quinn, Ian McKellen - the special effects are dynamite, with dialogue that doesn't take things all that seriously.

Last Action Hero (1993)

****

This is a fascinating movie. Take big star, add big action, add a bit of seriousness, then a bit of spoof then to finish it off add a interesting plot. You have Last Action Hero.

I've always thought this movie was brillant. You have obvious gags - The glass eye seen at Slater's exwife's house. The cop rotates it completely blowing up the house. Then the next scene Slater and Danny at the police station smoking - literally. I Other scenes are subtle; Robert Patrick leaving the Police station as the T1000 or elsewhere the hubcaps on Slater's convertible change for no reason. Also, look for the E.T. and Lethal Weapon gags.  The gags really get going about 15 minutes in.

My favorite line these days when Slater punches the Leutenent Gov. in the face. ""Call me when the Governor gets here,"" hilarious stuff now that Schwarzenegger is the California Govenator.

I can see why this movie failed. The average action fan doesn't like it when a movie is spoofing what it bills itself as. Action fans take their genre seriously.  You have have a specific style of humor you enjoy to get this. At points the movie almost has a cartoon style feel. That things happen for no reason. Personally, I think that adds to the charm of the whole thing. There is a comic book quality here.

The biggest outrage about this movie is the current DVD release. Full screen pan & scan? C'mon, other regions of world (R2, R4) have beautiful widescreen releases with some features and AC/DC's video for Big Gun. Why do we not have this? Flabbergasts me. Sony/Columbia Tri-Star should be embarrased for this terrible North American release.

I hearby call on Sony/Columbia Tri-Star to give us this title as Europe and Australia have. Thank goodness I have a region free DVD player. I have the R2 version of the movie. Looks sharp.

As for the movie is it deep and causes you to think about your place in the world? No, not even close. Is it a fun popcorn chomper that will have you veering to serious to spoof in a matter of seconds? Yes, absolutely. Is it worth seeing Ahnold spoof himself? Yes. The scenes where Slater comes into the real NYC - fascinating, serious and fun.

Bottom line - this movie weaves serious, spoof, danger and brings it all home in the end. Its a cerebal movie you have to stay with from beginning to end to understand it. Catching it 25 minutes in on TV, more than likely you'd be lost.

Good stuff. Now, Sony/Columbia Tri-Star... get this awful pan & scan version off the market and give us the nice release Europe and Australia have!",1120003200,3,2868,4.539805825242718

What made it fall apart was a weak story, and this would follow nearly all of Schwarzenegger's films post True Lies. To say Last Action Hero was rushed is quite an understatement considering John McTiernan did such a marvelous job depicting Bruce Willis and Sean Connery as two badass heroes in two brilliant written stories.

I guess what I'm getting at is I am damn sick and tired of listening to people rag this movie. I'm so sick of it, in fact, that I will outright lie through my teeth to people who dislike it and tell them that it is my favorite film, even though it really isn't. It isn't my favorite films of Arnold's by a long shot, but I still rank it in the top-ten. It isn't even one tenth as bad as they say it is. There were avid Schwarzenegger fans who actually came to loathe Arnold after he made this movie. Why, I ask? WHY? I DEMAND TO KNOW! Is it the acting? Is it the script? Is it the story and the premise? Special effects, car-chases, what? Okay, the acting is corny. I give you that. The story is far-fetched and the action is over-the-top. I give you that, too. But guess what, you stupid sh*ts? IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY! This film was intended as a social commentary. It is satire. It was intended to make fun of movies by example. It points out the most inherent flaw in all of cinema. Fantasy! That's right! It exposes the film industry for what it is. That is, a circus, a mad house, a rabid dog, a wild beast, a monolithic volcano of glamour, pretense, vanity, and and... AND just... shrill-shrieking-FRAUDS.

Okay, that's it then. I just answered my own question. The reason Hollywood holds such disdain for this film is simply because it does not like being the subject of such debates as morality and ethics. It's not like it is any big secret, though, that Hollywood is full of phonies, Satanists, (...)and demon worshipers. The world knew that years ago. It doesn't seem to hurt the grosses, though, does it? People keep seeing the movies. They keep watching television. They keep tuning into that political media circus that is the Oscars. Holly weird is clearly doing okay. So, why did this film scare them so? Don't ask me.

All I can tell you is that Arnold Schwarzeneger had to have a lot of balls to be in a movie like this. Especially when he was still a relative new comer to the acting profession and to America. But hey, it's just an action movie, and it's got a good plot.  Still, there seems to be no end to the contempt that film makers and critics have for Arnold. That isn't what pisses me off the most, though. What pisses me off the most is that the movie-going public could be so gullible and stupid as to accept whatever Hollywood tells them about a certain flick. Not critics, mind you. Nobody pays attention to critics anymore. Especially the stupid rich ones with their big thick books and their big thick mustaches. No, I'm talking about the entertainment industry, at large. Usually if every actor, every director, every producer, and every talk show personality gangs up on a certain individual, or a certain film and shouts at the top of their collective lungs ""THIS PERSON'S WORK IS TERRIBLE. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE,"" everyone believes them. What these people should be yelling is ""WE ARE FEARFUL. WE ARE JELOUS. WE WANT TO SEE THIS PERSON FAIL""  That's all entertainment is about. It's about one artist stabbing another in the back. It's not about teamwork anymore. Usually if enough people in the profession denounce a certain person's work, the rest of the world will think ""Well, gee! Everybody in Hollywood thinks this movie sucks. It must be true. Well, I'm not going to waste my money""

That is why this film bombed. Not because of its quality or lack thereof, but because of quantity. That is, quantity of people in the business who SAID it wasn't any good. And the so called fans just like the toadying bunch of impressionable troglodytes and knuckle-draggers that they are, fell for it. They stayed away from the film in masses. And what do you think happened? Well, the film flopped of course. It is Arnold Scwarzenegger's most daring attempt at artistic genius and nobody went to see the ****ing thing. Well, let me tell you something. I DID SEE THE FILM, AND I LIKED IT! AND I'M NOT ALONE! But I'm sick of being made to feel like a doofus any time I defend this flick. I am tired of people laughing at me when I tell them that I am an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, or a Jim Carrey fan, or a Norm Macdonald fan, or a Stephen King fan. I'm sick of it, and I won't stand for it. If anybody here needs to feel ashamed it is YOU POEPLE! I don't care what anybody says. So, you can all kiss my a$$ and go to hell. I love this movie, and I'll KILL ANYBODY WHO TRIES TO CHANGE MY MIND.

""Last Action Hero"" made fun of itself as it unfolded, and one would need a certain sense of humor to fully appreciate it on its intended level. I dare say that most folks who went to this film just didn't ""get it"". Too bad for them.

 The major flaw of the DVD is that the film is presented in the god-awful Pan and Scan format. Pan and Scan presentations of frenetically-shot widescreen films should be outlawed, it's just that simple. You almost get a headache watching this P&S version. The digital pan is so obtrusive and distracting that it can drive one to anger! It pulls you out of the film, to say the least.

11398,4,0767815335,"You've probably read this film's plot description already, but let me sumerize it briefly just to comment on it: Austin O'Brian is a huge Swartzenagger fan. Arnie's latest films (acording to this film,) are the Jack Slater movies, which (presumably) came out right after Terminator 2. Danny idolizes the character Jack Slater, a fictional L.A. cop, in the same way that so many of us idolized Han Solo. Then one day Danny's personal friend Mick, an elderly theater projectionist, gives him a magic ticket that was given to him by Houdini, just before Danny gets to watch the latest Slater film all by himself, before anyone eles does. (Jack Slater 4). Danny watches as the film introduces the two bad guys, who've kidnapped Slaters cousin Frank. The scene shifts to two nameless cops (who of course are sure-fire dead meat) who come to Frank's house after getting a false call about a drug deal. Slater arrives and wonders why they're here, he goes in and finds Frank tied to a chair, Frank gives Slater one last message before dying, Slater sees a note that turns out to be a count down and gets out just before the house blows up, the two red shirt cops...well, need I even say? A car full of dynomite-weilding bad guys drive up, Slater gets in his car and the chase is on! Then something strange happens. A stick of dynomite comes out of the screen and lands in the theater! It blows up, and Danny finds himself in Slater's car, now a character in the film!
I couldn't understand why so many critics and audiences hated this. Naturally I was upset when it bombed in the theatre. It was the most origonal film to come along in quite some time. I mean, really, who hasn't fantasized about being able to actually go into the world of their favorite movie or T.V. show and interact with the characters? Thankfully I see most people on Amazon have given this between four and five stars, so I'm not alone. I loved the action, the humor, (which is basically making fun of typical action films and just how absurd they are, even the ones that are meant to be taken seriously) and the one-liners.
O.K., here's one thing I _didn't_ like: the animated cat. I mean, what the @#&%?! The film works when it spoofs typical action films and ridiculous they are, but not when it goes all the way into the realm of farce and becomes something like Airplane! or Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Everything eles was fine, but the cartoon cat...well, when's the last time you saw a conventional action film with living cartoon characters? Really, what were they thinking?
Also, there was the bit where (POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING) we learn about half way through the film that Slater's son Andy was killed. This presumably happened at the end of Jack Slater 3. So Jack Slater 3, it would seem, ends with Slater shooting the Ripper (the bad guy from the last moive), and then the Ripper pulls Andy over with him. Would a typical Hollywood light-hearted action escapest film really have such a dark ending? Well, then again, I guess Lethal Weapon 2 had a simular ending.
Anyway, don't listen to anyone who's told you not to see this. This is not another dumb action movie, this is a film pokeing fun at dumb action films (including some of the ones Swartzenagger's made). Check it out for yourself.",1090195200,6,3269,4.608919382504288
11399,3,0767815335,"After MUCH deliberation, this was deemed an appropriate DVD to watch - after turning down all my other suggestions. And it turned out to be quite good!
This was filmed before Austin O'Brien became truly cringeworthy, with a god-awful haircut in My Girl 2. He's exactly the same here, and there were times I wanted to take a pair of scissors to his hair! (I've just seen a more recent photo, and he looks totally different!)
Last Action Hero has an almost Willy Wonka quality to it. There was a golden ticket that Charlie Bucket had to find and Danny Mannigan also had to find one - or actually got handed it. I was so waiting for Oompa Loompa's to come out! Now that would have been cool.
The whole story climaxes in Arnie being brought out of the movie, and getting to see the 'real' world, which is a very interesting concept, as it could be seen as we're not the ones in control. (I totally believe that) So his whole life was one big lie, and controlled by someone else - not the big man upstairs, but a film director. Arnie basically takes the p*ss out of his whole on screen persona in this, including lots of his trademark sayings, including: ""I'll be back!"", ""Trust me"" and ""Do it"". There's also a very funny scene where Jack Slater meets Arnold Schwarzeneggar - make sense of that!
Also look out for a whole host of cameos in this movie - ones which are easy, to spot, some which aren't! Some of these include: Chevy Chase, MC Hammer, Sharon Stone, Little Richard, Maria Shriver, Robert Patrick, and Jean-Claude Van Damme!
There are some great lines in this. Some of these are:
Danny Madigan: You think you are funny, don't you?
Jack Slater: I know I am. I'm the famous comedian Arnold Braunschweiger.
Danny Madigan: Schwarzenegger!
Jack Slater: Gesundheit.
Jack Slater: Kid! Who does the doctor treat?
Danny Madigan: Patients?
Jack Slater: Look at the elbow of my jacket. What is it doing?
Danny Madigan: Wearing thin?
Jack Slater: Bingo!
Benedict: Gentlemen. Since you are about to die anyway, I may as well tell you the entire plot. Think of villains Jack. You want Dracula? Dra-cool-la? Hang on
[takes out the ticket]
Benedict: , I'll fetch him. Dracula? Huh. I can get King Kong! We'll have a nightmare with Freddy Krueger, have a surprize party for Adolf Hitler, Hannibal Lecter can do the catering, and then we'll have christening for Rosemary's Baby! All I have to do is snap my fingers and they'll be here. They're lining up to get here, and do you know why Jack? Should I tell you why? Hmm? Because here, in this world, the bad guys can win!

11405,4,0767815335,"After his monumental success with Terminator 2, Arnold Schwarzenegger re-united with his Predator director John McTiernan for this action/fantasy farce.  The storyline concerns a young boy (Austin O'Brien) who comes across a magic movie ticket which allows Jack Slater (Schwarzenegger), a movie character who is played by Arnie, to leave his film world and come to the real world.  Get all that?  Good.  Schwarzenegger (who also served as executive producer) is great as he pokes fun at his action roles, his career, and himself.  The cast is sharp (including Charles Dance, Mercedes Ruehl, Tom Noonan, Bridgette Wilson, and Ian McKellan) with plenty of cameos (including Jean Claude Van Damme, Sharon Stone, Tina Turner, Robert Patrick, and Arnie's wife Maria Shriver) and the action is nicely directed, but Last Action Hero comes close to wearing out it's welcome thanks to it's overly long running time and anti-climatic ending.  Last Action Hero wasn't too well received by critics upon it's release, but it still stands as a fun Arnie romp.",1070582400,3,1045,5.190476190476191
11406,5,0767815335,"This is a resoundingly misunderstood film.  Probably the finest parody ever made of the action genre as a whole; this film mocks the absurd excesses that most summertime action blockbusters indulge in.  The script is clever enough to divide itself between the dark brutality of the real world and the campy superficiality of Hollywood.  It revels in poking fun of the very films that have made Arnold Schwarzenegger (in?)famous.
 The world outside the silver screen is filled with stark reminders of how un-Hollywood life is.  There is crime, bullets hurt good people, and extras that are killed have families they've left behind.  Young Danny (Austin O'Brien) loves film more than anything else.  He attempts to put aside the problems of his life in live in the world that Hollywood has created for him.  His favorite indulgence is the Jack Slater series of films.  They star Arnold Schwarzenegger as the title-hero, a cop modeled after the cloned result of Dirty Harry and Rambo.  Slater is a smooth operator who never makes a wrong step and never fails to land on his feet.  He is essentially everything that Danny, and in reality most children, wish they could be.  When he is given a magical movie ticket by Nick the friendly pathetic mildly wise projectionist at his favorite theater, Danny is transported beyond his world into that of his hero, Jack Slater.  He is quickly engulfed in one of the most entertaining action sequences ever put to film.  It is the crystallization of the genre where there is unexplained action and unnecessary and unequal reaction.  A car explodes because another car goes near it.  A would-be assassin is thrown from his perch atop a moving truck into a parked ice-cream truck that then explodes.  A truck explodes in the air for no good reason, and meanwhile, all the women are attractive (by Hollywood standards).  They move from action sequence to action sequence, all of which are completely superfluous and equally delightful.  Anyone who has ever made fun of, or rightly criticized, the films of Jerry Bruckheimer would find this work profoundly amusing.  On screen, Slater and Danny must confront the cycloptic henchman Benedict (Charles Dance) and his benefactor Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn) in order to stop a takeover the SoCal black market and to extract revenge for the killing of Slater's favorite second cousin.  This plot of course, is secondary to the parody.  It moves well and revels in its self-justifying fictional world where a cartoon cat can be a cop, because it's normal there.
 The other side of the screen is filmed with dim lighting and always hinting at danger beneath the surface.  Danny's mom (Mercedes Ruehl) is a widow who struggles to support her child both materially and emotionally.  She works the unglamorous midnight shift.  Nick is a washed-up never-was who had dreams of another career and justifies compromises he has made to his goals by referring to his job in the manner, ""Hey, it's still show business.""  When Slater enters this world, and gets shot, not only do the bullets hit him, but they cause more than flesh wounds.  In the ""real world"" the on-screen villains can take advantage of corrupt systems to come out on top.
 This film parodies not only action heroes and the action genre, but also bad scripts.  Danny knows not only what has already happened in the movie, he can accurately predict the next steps of the transparent plot of the action film he was watching and then participates in.  The film makes groan-inducing puns and points them out.  The film points out how action films sometimes modify classics to fit into modern pop culture.  This movie could have been a bit shorter and could have done without some of the melodrama in the ""real"" world.  But those are miniscule flaws next to the eminently enjoyable rest of the film.",1070236800,12,3823,4.885093167701863
11407,5,0767815335,"This is one of those movies that a lot of people that haven't seen it say, ""That movie wasn't really that good, was it?"" but those that have seen it, say, ""Why wasn't this movie more popular?"" Maybe it was bad timing, or as some others suggested, just not correctly billed to the public.
Last Action Hero is hard to describe. It's funny, it's witty, with lots of those one-liners that Arnold became so popular with, and I loved the way he constantly poked fun at his fictional character as well as his ""real"" self. Some of my favorite dialogue in the movie is when the kid is trying to convince ""character Arnold (aka: Jack Slater)"" that he's actually just a character in a movie. The kid starts asking about phone numbers and how can they possibly all start with 555- in a city with several million phone numbers, when Jack Slater exasperatedly says, ""That's why we have Area Codes..."" Priceless. The movie is full of fun stuff like that, and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is even remotely a Schwarzenegger fan, or who just like campy, yet intelligent, movies. The parody within a parody, and movie within a movie actually worked well in this one.
I thought the movie had a lot of great character performances, and clever scripting, and I think this movie got a bum rap. It's really a great movie, I'm glad I bought the DVD. The transfer is a little sloppy in places on the one I bought, but since it's a ""Special Anniversary Edition"", I have a feeling that had something to do with it.

It's two halves of two good films edited together, and they don't blend _at all_.  In one half, the comedy sidekick bounces across housetops on his bicycle with no harm done and all the bullets miss our heroes; in the other, the hero, angst-ridden since the death (debatably, murder) of his son, ends up in a traffic-stuck ambulance dying graphically in blood and agony.
Oil and water would look positively emulsified by comparison.

Sure, it has the reputation of being a bad film, but it's bad in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way. Ah-nold's physical presence and delightfully deep-toned & accented banter really adds a great deal of... um... well, pretty much the same things to this flick as it has all the other actioners he's ever been in. And, like other flicks that feature a prepubescent kid, budding thespian Austin O'Brien gives this baby that tried-and-true aw-shucks-isn't-he-just-keeyoot factor that adds to both the hokey fun AND the nausea! The on-screen chemistry between him and Arnold is part 'Laurel & Hardy', and part Riggs-and-Murtaugh. Well, actually it's more part Abbott & Costello, and part 'Tango & Cash'... um, no that's not quite right, either. Well, let's just say it's a much better team-up than Sylvester Stallone & Estelle Getty ('Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot'). Come to think of it, what action-comedy team-up ISN'T better than that?
But I digress. If you're looking for a not-half-bad action/comedy flick that possesses plenty of super-hokey megacheese moments, and will leave you both entertained and mortified that you were entertained by it, 'Last Action Hero' just might be the movie you've been looking for!

11427,1,0767815335,"This movie is the epitome of excess: budget, explosions, melodrama, ""cuteness"", in-jokes.  LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is.  It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands.  The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as, "" That skit was pretty cool, huh?"".  The action sequences, intended to be absurd, only elicit yawning.  The child, who was intended to be cute, is annoying.
The only saving grace, if you can call it that, LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar's performance.  His (non)acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES.  If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar's acting, then your movie is in serious trouble.
I like a good spoof movie as much as anyone, as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies.  But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS.  On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended.  There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle.

True, it is not as bittersweet as Allen's movie but I don't  find that to be a flaw.  It is a very fun movie and it was very enjoyable  the whole way through.  Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great parody of  himself as Slater who spits out one liners during violent conflicts.  I  even found Austin O' Brien to be a fairly decent child actor in this film  and that is a rare suprise in this sort of a film.

11462,5,0767815335,"Forget what the critics said.  This movie works beautifully on several different levels.  As an action spoof it is hilarious, with many in-jokes, gags and cameos.  As a fantasy it is ingenious with Austin O'Brien very  appealing as a kid with a ""magic ticket"" that can transport him  from the real world into the fake world of action films. And it works  splendidly as a send up of Schwarzenegger's movie image giving him a big  chance to do what he does best-poke fun at himself.  It also works as one  of the most original buddy movies ever.  There is a lot going on here and  it will take a few viewings to catch everything but that is what makes a  good movie good.  The action is wall-to-wall, no doubt, like many other  action films, good or bad.  The sequences are very well done but contrived,  just like many of those previously mentioned films. But they are contrived  for a reason-to spoof the genre.  Because a lot of people who originally  saw this didn't get it, it is, in this critic's humble opinion, one of the  most misunderstood films of all time.  That accounted for its bad reviews  and low box office.  But it is my belief that this was largely due to poor  marketing.  When Schwarzenegger (who served as executive producer) would  appear on television to plug it, he made a fatal mistake.  His description  of this as a family movie was wrong.  It is very violent, even though that  too is done for a purpose.  Imagine what a lot of parents thought when they  took their kids to see this and within the first fifteen minutes or so,  several people are killed or injured and there are gunshots and explosions  galore.  It is a mistake that to this day Arnold's career hasn't been able  to completely recover from. Be that as it may, you must see this film for  what it is and enjoy imagination and spoof at its finest.  You will not be  disappointed!",947376000,17,1872,4.458333333333333
11463,2,0767815335,"""The Last Action Hero"" is a rare thing- an action comedy spoof that has difficulty remembering what it is supposed to be exactly. The action genre is certainly ripe for a mocking, what with the thousands of  ""Die Hard"" clones Hollywood has thrust upon the public. This  could have been the perfect spoof film- team ""Die Hard"" director  John McTiernan with The Terminator and let the jokes fly. But instead the  movie tries to be serious, then tries to make jokes about the genre, then  goes back to being serious again. The actors are making one kind of movie,  the directors are making another. It ends up a damn mess.
Aside from a  humorous bit with Arnold as Hamlet at the begining, this one is a real dog.",945475200,,709,4.4921875
11464,5,0767815335,"Last Action Hero is a top film that has a great sense of humour. A satire of action movies this involves a young boy by the name of Danny Maddigan who is obsessed with the movies. He is always at the cinema with the  projectionist named Nick and he stays there admiring his favourite action  hero and role model Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenneger), even though he  ends up flunking from school. He is offered by Nick the chance to see the  new Jack Slater 4 before it opens at midnight. When he goes he is given a  magic ticket which was given to Nick by Houdini. He uses the ticket without  knowing what it does and Houdini claimed it was a magic ticket which Nick  was too scared to open. And so, Danny ends up in the movie and becomes  Slater's new partner. This a great satire of action films and it is  incredibly funny, the film also features briefly Tina Turner,James  Belushi,Jean Claude Van Damme, Chevy Chase and many other top name  celebrities, definitely a film worth buying.",945216000,5,988,4.4636871508379885

7788873,5,0767815335,"My favorite Schwarzenegger film by far! His most disrespected and overlooked film. People took it as a joke because he was being way too silly and comical in this film but that's what makes the film so great to me. The fact that he could make fun of himself and still incorporate action within' the film. Great stunts and action scenes. The film stars Arnold as a fictional character named Jack Slater who always brings down the bad guys doing things his way. His biggest fan, 12 year old Danny Madigan (played by Austin O' Brian) goes to see the Jack Slater 4 sequel. He's given a magical ticket from his best friend and owner of the theater, Nick (played by Robert Prosky). Nick informs Danny that he was given the ticket as a kid by the great Whodini, whom told Nick that the ticket was real and magical. He never believed it because he didn't wanna be disappointed in Whodini fooling him about the ticket & was also too afraid to give it a try thinking that it just might be real after all allowing you to get inside the movies of the fictional world. Well, while Danny's sitting in the theater watching the Slater film-he actually becomes apart of the movie finding out that the ticket is indeed very real and magical. It's a great action fantasy ride getting Danny involved in all kinds of adventures alongside Jack, but Danny must get back to his world-the real world, which he eventually does after the bad guy villain, Benedict (played by Charles Dance) steals the ticket and it comes to life yet again allowing him to travel through worlds. Now it's up to Jack & Danny to prevent Benedict from sending The Ripper-Slater's arch nemesis from Jack Slater 3 (played by Tom Noonan) to the opening premier to kill Arnold Schwarzenegger so he and Benedict could put an end to Jack Slater once and for all.",1523923200,,1808,4.532110091743119
