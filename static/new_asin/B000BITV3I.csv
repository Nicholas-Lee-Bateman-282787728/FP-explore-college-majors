8087233,2,B000BITV3I,Kudos to Alpha for making this available on DVD but the source material and subsequent transfer is pretty poor. I am not aware of any better print available to date so for a few bucks second hand probably worth it for the fans of the novel and its numerous movie adaptations.,1489968000,,275,4.411764705882353

WONDERING WHICH DIRECTION HIS WRITING ACTING AND DIRECTING SKILLS WOULD COME AT YOU NEXT WITH WHAT SURPRISE!
THIS IS A SERIAL AND HARRY WAS HARD AT WORK IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION MAKING THIS ACTION ADVENTURE. GOOD STUFF!",1468281600,,327,4.655172413793103
8087235,2,B000BITV3I,"I've pretty much seen every filmed version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"", but I still haven't read the book so I don't know what the real plot is to this historical novel.  This is a poorly acted, poorly filmed serial from 1932.  It was one of Harry Carey's last pieces of work from what I gather.  In this story, Alice, the younger sister, is romantically involved with Maj. Heyward.  There's never any inkling of romance between lovely Cora and ugly Hawk-Eye.  Chingachgook is always called The Sagamore.  I never heard Chingachgook.  Now I watched the first 4 episodes and the last one.  The jacket said this is 108 minutes.  Nope.  Try 3 hours and 43 minutes.  The adaptation is also hard to watch.  It flickers, is grainy and of poor quality.  While I still love the story in general, this is a pretty bad example.",1319846400,6,819,4.527397260273973
8087236,3,B000BITV3I,"MASCOT PICTURES made serials under its own name from 1926 to 1935. After that, MASCOT and four other lesser ""Poverty Row"" studios were combined under the REPUBLIC PICTURES banner.

This 1932 version of LAST OF THE MOHICANS is considered slow-moving by modern standards. The script doesn't adhere too closely to Cooper's novel, and there are even characters here that never appeared in the book.

MOHICANS trivia:

Harry Carey (Hawk-Eye) once wrote, starred and toured in a successful play called ""Montana."" His film career spanned the silent era, where he worked with D.W. Griffth, right through the late 1940s.

Edwina Booth (Cora) contracted jungle fever in 1931 while filming TRADER HORN, and was forced into early retirement shortly after completion of this serial.

Stuntman-extraordinaire Yakima Canutt starred in a few silent-era westerns. He was also at times an assistant director, production coordinator, writer and stunt coordinator on dozens of great films.

Mischa Auer (Montcalm) was typecast in ""Mad Russian"" roles in the 1930s and '40s.

Chief John Big Tree's likeness appears on the Indian head nickel. Big Tree has a minor uncredited role in this serial. He was a full-blooded Seneca Indian.
