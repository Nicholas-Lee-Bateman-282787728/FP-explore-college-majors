8564789,5,B00B9QHLYM,"I am particularly fond of retro scifi from the 1950s and early 60s. Tom Corbett is a landmark show from the days of early live television. These rare kinescopes take the viewer back to the days when kid's shows has a virrtual non-existant budget, but a lot of imagination. One can see the seeds of future shows like Star Trek being sown by Tom and the crew of the Polaris. Spaceman's Luck, all!",1382227200,10,394,4.410958904109589
8564790,1,B00B9QHLYM,"Really - I like a lot of those cheesy old SF serials:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buck-Rogers/dp/B002KVSJ6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buck Rogers</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flash-Gordon/dp/B00004Y2QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flash Gordon</a>, even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undersea-Kingdom/dp/B00004YS6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undersea Kingdom</a>. Their earnest spirit, valiant attempts at special effects, and varied sets and scenery all set them apart from this pitiful puddle of poo. Sets look like they were mostly made from refrigerator boxes with the occasional giant knife switch, acting is dreary beyond words, and the costumes ... Well, the collars look to me like love-mad nudibranchs nearly dead of exhaustion and frustration from trying to perform indecent and anatomically misguided acts on their necks. I mean, I have no prejudice against invertebrate-Americans of any phylum, but some things just aren't right. [The bizarrely quaint ads for shoes and candy have a cachet of their own. Creepy, maybe, but there's something in them.]

It's not that I dislike the old serials, or spotty prints of old B&W movies, or the low budgets. It's just that I dislike this.
