393486,5,630196778X,"If you're a fan of show music from the thirties and forties, you are sure to enjoy ""Deep in My Heart."" Jose Ferrer plays Romberg, a composer and recent immigrant, who begins writing popular music and scores for the Shubert shows on Broadway, including ""May Time"" and ""The Desert Song."" He is mentored by actress Dorothy Donnelly (Merle Oberon), who also writes the story for his hugely successful show, ""The Student Prince."" He falls in love with a young lady at a summer resort and, with Dorothy's help, marries her.

This 1954 film features a song-and-dance number from each of Romberg's musicals, performed by popular guest stars. Ferrer sings and dances surprisingly well, and gives a light-hearted performance. If you are already familiar with Romberg's tunes, you'll find yourself singing along. It's done in the old MGM-style with beautiful color, sumptious sets and costumes, and wholesome family values. An uplifting, entertaining movie.",1025308800,43,946,5.223684210526316

Jose Ferrer is charming as Rommie, Merle Oberon gives a nice performance as his love interest, and the list of cameos is starry, with Rosemary Clooney shining in one number and the great operatice soprano Helen Traubel singing ""Softly"" as it must be, a touching plea full of torment, angst, and ultimately acceptance.

Highlights include Helen Traubel's 'Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise' and Gene Kelly's pas deux with brother Fred, 'I Love To Go Swimmin' With Women'. Cyde Charisse and Cameron Mitchell are a sultry couple, dancing to 'One Alone' But honestly, the era of the cavalcade musical ended in the forties with such sumptuous and infinitely more intriguing spectacles like Till The Clouds Roll By, Words & Music, and Thousands Cheer. Deep in My Heart has been given some meticulous care from the Warner Archive, but it still suffers from less than spectacular image quality; a flaw of the film stock - not this 1080p transfer, which is as ideal as it can get.

That Kelly lad sure can dance. Fred Kelly that is, in his only credited film role, he and legendary brother Gene Kelly happily hoof with an l Love to Go Swimmin with Wimmen specialty romp in this colourful musical biopic about Sigmund Romberg, the ex-piano man who went on to compose some 8O productions. Theres much more to love, too. Ann Miller gams and glams It (from The Desert Song). Jane Powell and Vic Damone remember Will You Remember (Maytime). Jos Ferrer as Sigmund Romberg demos all the roles of a gleefuljazza-Doo spree. And before Deep in My Heart is sung, danced and jazza-done, youll find Cyd Charisse, Merle Oberon, Howard Keel and more. The talent runs deep. So does the fun.

FILM FACT: The costumes in the ""It"" number were recycled from the ""Beautiful Girls"" number in Singin' in the Rain [1952]. One female dancer is wearing Cyd Charisse's green flapper dress from the ""Broadway Melody"" Ballet. During the Mr. and Mrs. Number, Jos Ferrer was actually singing and dancing with his then-wife Rosemary Clooney, who was pregnant at the time. In an interview Jos Ferrer disclosed that he had to redo the ""Jazza-Jazza-Doo-Doo"" routine several times because the crew kept laughing out loud and interfering with the sound track. The director finally cleared the set of everyone not needed to film the segment and this time they got it on film. Gene Kelly's dance partner in the ""I Love to go Swimmin' with Wimmen"" number is his younger brother, Fred. The ""Serenade"" set used for ""The Student Prince"" segment is the same set that was used in The Student Prince [1954], which had been shot earlier that year. The role of Anna Mueller was originally intended for Jeanette MacDonald. The chorus dancer in yellow initially sitting at the bar in Ann Miller's number is Gene Kelly.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: DEEP IN MY HEART [1954] is a delightful musical, of the biography of composer Sigmund Romberg that is perhaps not so much biography as it is pastiche, but this is what makes it so successful. It is long a common complaint of classic film fans, even fans of musicals that filmed biographies of composers fall short of the mark when it comes to being authentic or factual.  I won't disagree.  However, neither do I expect a musical, even in the form of a biography of a composer, to be a documentary.  It is first and foremost a revue of his music, and DEEP IN MY HEART gives us a smattering of Sigmund Rombergs experiences as in immigrant to the USA in the days of Tin Pan Alley, nevertheless firmly keeps to his music as a method of telling the story of his aspirations as a composer. To this end Sigmund Romberg was fighting the modern trends of music with its soul-crushing disposable fads, and yearning for the opportunity to express himself in his own way and these ideals are timeless among creative people and in telling this story the film is completely successful.

Director Stanley Donens film DEEP IN MY HEART [1954] is a film bio-pic on the life and times of Austro-Hungarian born composer, Sigmund Romberg, whose sentimental operettas set the Broadway stage afire all the way back in the late teens and early 1920s. Predictably, its a lie, despite screenwriter, Leonard Spigelgass having Elliott Arnolds legitimate biography on Romberg from which to glean his inspiration. But DEEP IN MY HEART film is not interested in facts, nor even Sigmund Romberg per say; it is really only about his prolific music, that is portrayed in a light hearted way by Mel Ferrer; who gives a very convincing performance on how Sigmund Romberg rose to prominence, with the help of the brilliant director Stanley Donen, who manages to cram no less than 22 songs from 11 Broadway shows in the composers bulging back catalogue. This was the last of M-G-Ms three lavishly appointed bio-pics devoted to the famous Tin Pan Alley composers, which of course culminate in the M-G-M studios previous two efforts, which included Till The Clouds Roll By [1946] and, Words and Music [1948] which is infinitely superior in virtually all regards, especially more delicately structured, if no less fictional. But DEEP IN MY HEART is M-G-Ms last gasp to show off its formidable array of musical talent in some very big bold and splashy production numbers to great effect.

DEEP IN MY HEART opens with an orchestral fanfare and dedication to Sigmund Romberg, and here Jos Ferrer is presumably conducting the M-G-M studio orchestra through an overture of highlights. From here, we go to the studios time-honoured New York Street outdoor set, looking slightly artificial, but at least it shows us what the period costumes were at the time, that seems to be sparsely populated by extras. We glimpse a much younger Sigmund Romberg hurrying into the Caf Vienna to work as a waiter in this Tyrolean establishment, which is a reconstituted from the set decorations from the film The Student Prince [1947] and is run by Sigmund Rombergs good friend, Anna Mueller [Helen Traubel]. Anna Mueller has great faith in Rommies song writing abilities, but not much encouragement from the over the top song writing promoter, Lazar Berrison, Sr. [David Burns] who, after hearing a sample of Sigmund Rombergs stuff, declares him it is definitely old hat and pass. The public doesnt want to do their high stepping to three quarter time, but more like the jazzy riffs of ragtime. Undaunted, Sigmund Romberg writes the song The Leg of Mutton a very nonsensical ditty that nevertheless catches the popular zeitgeist and becomes a massive big seller.

Sigmund Romberg is unimpressed, both with his residuals and the results. Nevertheless, a short while later, the popularity of the The Leg of Mutton attracts the attentions of Bert Townsend, the right hand man to Broadway impresario, J.J. Shubert and while interrupting J.J. Shuberts rehearsals with prima chanteuse, Gaby Deslys [Tamara Toumanova], Sigmund Romberg auditions a new song he has expressly written to impress J.J. Shubert. However, after listening to a few bars of Softly, As In The Morning Sunrise and so Gaby Deslys, Bert Townsend and J.J. Shubert are all rather dismissive of its possibilities. Alas, on opening night, Sigmund Romberg witnesses what crass commercialism can do to a subtly sustained ballad, especially with Gaby Deslys is seen cavorting in a skimpy costume, adorned from horn to hoof in lurid red feathers and prancing about like a circus pony; the songs fragile lyrics having lost all poignancy as she stamps her high-heeled shoes down a majestic staircase and it is a total disaster, as far as Sigmund Romberg is concerned.

From here on in, DEEP IN MY HEART almost entirely devotes its time on the screen as a sort of revue-styled travelogue through the Sigmund Romberg catalogue; and introducing us to the cavalcade of riches in Sigmund Rombergs repertoire and somewhere along the way, Dorothy Donnelly [Merle Oberon falls ill who sadly died at only 47; and in the final majestic number before a full orchestra, Rombergs signature tune, Deep in My Heart. And her off-screen death is dealt with swiftly; but then Sigmund Romberg finds himself adrift in no mans land and reluctantly has to move on to establish a partnership with Oscar Hammerstein II. More truncated vignettes devoted to Sigmund Rombergs life behind the scenes, sandwiched between an interminable series of ballads and production numbers. Time passes as it always does in these types of films. Attending the opening night party for his latest venture at the Caf Vienna, Sigmund Romberg suffers his most scathing reviews yet and even worse scenario, he is inadvertently insulted by a bobby-soxer, Arabella Bell [Susan Luckey], who accompanied by her date, Lazar Berrison Jr. [Russ Tamblyn]; and Sigmund Romberg is told that his music is too highbrow for the masses. But this criticism sparks Lillian to reconsider her husbands place in the echelons of great composers. Sigmund Romberg has transcended Broadway and Sigmund Romberg is encouraged to conduct a symphonic orchestra in a study of his greatest theatrical achievements, Sigmund Romberg, sort of briefly resists and in short order, Sigmund Romberg thinks better on his decision to delay, and appears on stage at Carnegie Hall. His farewell speech to the audience is perhaps the most poetic part of the entire film; waxing whimsically about high vs. lowbrow and art vs. commerce; with his summation and reflections on a life richly lived and even more richly rewarded; Sigmund Romberg saving his most heartfelt thanks for his beloved Lillian, bringing her on stage to share in this night of nights as the audience rises to give them both a standing ovation.

Stanley Donen, I think was a totally brilliant and exceptional director of musicals, and his quick style and expressive camera work reminds me a little of the work of Michael Curtiz in a way, the way the camera sweeps, pans, and catches little things and it is never static.  But it is the outstanding cast of this musical that is the most intriguing. Jos Ferrer stars as composer Sigmund Romberg who is a star on Broadway and of course it was a serendipitous choice as Jos Ferrer is astounding in this role and was a true Renaissance man, his abilities not only in dramatic acting, musicianship, languages, and a beautifully silly flare for comedy, as Jos Ferrer is perfect in this film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Archive Collection has really pushed the boat out in presenting this beautiful Technicolor [Eastmancolor stock] wizard of a film DEEP IN MY HEART in a stunning 1080p encoded image and an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio. But for Blu-ray a new scan was created at 2k from an interpositive by Warner's Motion Picture Imaging facility that helps to give the film and the Blu-ray a brilliant substantial cleaning and restoration work of the image was undertaken in the digital domain, and a few shots had to be substituted from dupes because of damage and similar issues. The Blu-ray image is totally remarkable, with very solid blacks, but for any alert viewer may occasionally notice a bluish cast to some of the tuxedos worn by Sigmund Romberg or his, but this is an effect of lighting rather than an issue with the image, as the remaining blacks in the frame remain steady. The Technicolor colours are totally vibrant, and detail are very strong, all of which allows one to appreciate the elaborate decor and costumes of the many production numbers viewed throughout the film to great effect, so top marks for Warner Archive Collection for achieving a first class image quality that makes this film look so good to view.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Once again Warner Archive Collection has again really pushed the boat out in presenting this film DEEP IN MY HEART in a very impressive 5.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Sound and the Special Features are presented in an equally impressive 2.0 DTS-HD Audio Stereo. The sound remixes gives the orchestral performances a thrilling fullness across the front soundstage, with the rear channels providing a sense of space and depth. Dynamic range and clarity are both impressive, especially in the rendering of the vocal performances, which reach operatic highs in the case of singers like Helen Traubel; with her rich deep voices and especially with Howard Keel's baritone sound is equally good. The dialogue is clearly equally rendered, even when Jos Ferrer delivers it at top speed, which is quite often. I can definitely say watching this brilliant Blu-ray of DEEP IN MY HEART gives all fans of Sigmund Romberg's music a really fulfilling experience and as far as I am concerned there is no doubt that this sound and vision reproduction of this Blu-ray gives it as good a showcase as possible and it was a totally satisfying experience, so well done Warner Archive Collection.

Finally, DEEP IN MY HEART is a film I have never heard of before, but what a joy and delight it has seeing this amazing Technicolor brought out on the equally brilliant Blu-ray release and I hope Warner Archive Collection will release more of these hidden gems in the future. Of course DEEP IN MY HEART will not appeal to all viewers of this type of Hollywood genre biography type musical, especially on the composer Sigmund Romberg, who to be honest I had never heard of, but did know of all that he produced, but didn't realise it was from him. But despite this, the film reflects a genuine love of an art form that provides an essential enjoyment for modern entertainment, and for anyone who loves musicals like I do, will find something to enjoy here, whether it's the central performance, the colourful kaleidoscope of the production numbers and especially simply the idealised view of Broadway a century ago and it is a credit to the professional job of Warner Archive Collection in bringing this Blu-ray to everyone who again loves these types of Hollywood genre biography type musicals to our attention and please keep up the good work. Highly Recommended!

393871,5,630196778X,"One of MGM's last, if not THE last of the all-star musical biographies, ""Deep in My Heart"" is a revelation on Blu-ray. The DVD looked very good, and was my first opportunity to see the film in widescreen. The improvement brought by Blu-ray is remarkable. The sparkling, immaculate image quality and superb lossless DTS sound add so much more to the experience, this is a real must-have for any fans of MGM musicals. The performances here are what make the movie. The story-telling itself is just fine, with excellent performances all the way around, especially with Jose Ferrer really giving a tour-de-force turn as Sigmund Romberg. He's charming, and shows off his own unique musical performance abilities. As others have noted here, director Stanley Donen provides phenomenal showcases for the studio's most prestigious talents including Ann Miller's jazz-tap/charleston number called ""It"", Gene Kelly performing with his brother Fred, beautiful vocalizing from the likes of Jane Powell, Vic Damone, Howard Keel and Tony Martin, and most importantly a sequence representing ""The Desert Song"" called ""One Alone"" featuring Cyd Charisse and James Mitchell, which has to stand as one of the most astounding pieces of dance ever put on film. The two artists electrify the screen in this sequence that manages to capture the essence of passion and romance to a new degree, all achieved through their artistry. One should also note the beguiling work of Metropolitan Opera diva Helen Traubel who is completely charming.

Most importantly, this is a Blu-ray for fans of film musicals to relish as it is a first-class presentation in every way. Kudos to Warner Brothers for giving us yet another exceptional classic that looks and sounds amazing. This is one disc you'll be putting on frequently, especially to savor the outstanding musical sequences.",1447804800,,1844,5.2087542087542085

394207,5,630196778X,"This anomaly among splashier Metro musicals has every artistic pedigree of the legendary Arthur Freed Unit but was smartly produced by Roger Edens (vocal advisor to Judy Garland, among other Freed regulars), who also coordinated Stanley Donen's (pseudo-Freedian) Paramount masterpiece FUNNY FACE. While the Freed spectaculars at least pretended a semblance of plot (and in the case of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and BANDWAGON had sparkling scripts), Edens recognizes that the true gist of this genre is music allied to dance, and here Sigmund Romberg is celebrated in gaudy (Eastmancolor) excelsis, a ravishing selection of songs (Rommie's Very Greatest Hits) sung and danced by larger-than-life Stars of undisputed talent. Merle Oberon and Walter Pidgeon are somewhere within this cast, mere decorative thespians in Edens' all-singing/dancing ""biographical"" revue. (Pidgeon is cast in a throwaway cameo as impresario J.J. Shubert but had actual Romberg singing creds, introducing ""You will remember Vienna"" in the 1930 Warners musical VIENNESE NIGHTS.)

In the millennium Romberg's music might seem quaintly dated and not without kitsch, but it has endured as quality show music specific to its kinder gentler era. The film, partly but not entirely disowned by the redoubtable Donen, sags with Rommie's nonmusical wooing of Doe Avedon (replacing Donna Reed), Ferrer's self-indulgent star turn (thinking he was signing on to a biopic, he was overparted from the get-go) and his endless one-man production number where he is insufferably boring (Jim Backus and Paul Stewart are in it, somewhere, too but thoroughly upstaged and drowned out by Ferrer's hyper overkill).

The happier news is that this is Helen Traubel's film debut, and she is the authentic star (replacing Jeanette MacDonald) of this show. The dignified Met diva (crazily third-billed after Ferrer and Oberon) is magisterial, buck-dances a bit in ""Leg of mutton"" (this is, remember, a Donen dance film, and Ferrer, humbled, is actually better here) and throughout interprets Romberg with uncommon feeling and German-American charm. Her portamenti in ballads (especially ""Softly as in a morning sunrise,"" ""You will remember Vienna"" and ""Auf wiedersehen"") are meltingly beautiful, and Traubel's is the most robust (and most macho) trumpeted version of ""Stout-hearted men"" you'll ever hear. She apprehends this Romberg/operetta idiom as thoroughly as she did Wagner, and for Mme Traubel alone this film is worth reviving and enjoying with a critical eye.

There are three glamourous, Freed-calibre, numbers integral to the film: Ann Miller's kicky tap Charleston ""It"" which is devil-may-care and really exhausting to watch; Cyd Charisse's exotic, opulent and erotic dance to ""One alone""; and her husband Tony Martin's operatic ""Lover come back to me"" which is very moving and consummately staged. Outside the film there's a choice outtake included as a DVD bonus, Mme Traubel's haunting and heartbreaking staged performance of the neglected Romberg rarity ""Dance, my darlings,"" introduced on Broadway by Nancy McCord in the 1935 Walter Slezak musical MAY WINE. (As in her pal Jerry Lewis' LADIES MAN in 1961, Traubel's most warmly revealing film moments were regularly excised in the cutting room.)

Five stars are deserved for Roger Edens' scrupulous showmanship, the superior quality of the music and production numbers (the sumptuous orchestrations are by Conrad Salinger, Hugo Friedhofer and Alexander Courage), and especially for La Traubel, who is eminently worth watching as with her heftier Star Power she continually outpoints the hapless Ferrer. Romberg's sweetly Viennese-inflected Broadway standards are imperishable and guaranteed to whet your appetite for more of his music, never more lavishly presented than by Edens, Donen and these floridly cast super troupers.",1389744000,3,3834,5.5487179487179485

  I did a little research and discovered that the opening scenes, telling the story of how Romberg ""composed"" the ""Leg of Mutton Rag"", undoubtedly never happened historically, but rather, were the work of the screen writer's imagination.

394459,4,630196778X,"1954's DEEP IN MY HEART came during the period when MGM was riding high on a series of ""composer biography"" musicals that weren't so much biographies as they were star-studded revues for some of their biggest musical talents.  In most cases, the slight (and often highly-fictionalised) stories of the composers were simply a device in getting from one splashy musical sequence to the next.  Such was the case in ""Till the Clouds Roll By"" (Jerome Kern), ""Words and Music"" (Rodgers & Hart), and ""Three Little Words"" (Kalmar & Ruby).  Warner Bros. had even gotten into the act with Cary Grant starring as Cole Porter in ""Night and Day"".

DEEP IN MY HEART is the story of Sigmund Romberg, one of the most prolific composers from the early days of the American musical theater.  Romberg was born in Hungary and emigrated to the States in 1909.  He started out playing in small cafs and restaurants, but his passion was to compose a romantic style of music, with that unmistakable European flavour, for the Broadway musical stage.  Flying against the trends of the time, Romberg created a series of lush operettas, including ""Maytime"", ""The Student Prince"" and ""The Desert Song"".  He died in 1951; but his final show came posthumously in 1954 with ""The Girl in Pink Tights"".

Jose Ferrer gives an amiable performance as Romberg (""Rommie"") in DEEP IN MY HEART.  Ferrer was a true Renaissance Man in the best sense, and he worked long and hard to deliver a strong musical performance in this film.  Supporting him with equally memorable roles are Merle Oberon as friend/collaborator Dorothy Donnelly; and opera singer Helen Traubel as the Viennese caf owner who gives ""Rommie"" his start.  Doe Avedon is the eventual Mrs. Romberg, and Tamara Toumanova (one of the famed original ""baby ballerinas"" from the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo), has a small but fun cameo role.

Musically-speaking the film is a virtual treasure-trove of outstanding musical sequences.  Vic Damone and Jane Powell, in an outrageously frilly white hoopskirt gown, perform an excerpt from ""Maytime""; and Tony Martin and Joan Weldon sing a piece from ""New Moon"".  Cyd Charisse and James Mitchell perform a very sultry pas de deux based on ""One Alone"" from ""The Desert Song""; and ""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" has nothing on Ann Miller and her manic tap-dancing Charleston (yes, you read that correctly), ""It"", from ""Artists and Models"".  A cute little throwaway number called ""Mr. & Mrs."" has Ferrer's real-life wife Rosemary Clooney briefly sharing the screen with her husband; and Gene Kelly introduces his brother Fred in the exuberant ""I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen"".

Director Stanley Donen admitted in later years that he never especially cared for the film.  ""It wasn't up my alley,"" he once said. ""I would have run from that picture like crazy except for [producer] Roger [Edens], who wanted me to direct. Roger had been my biggest promoter. While Arthur [Freed] let me do ""On the Town"" with Gene [Kelly], it was Roger who really thought that I had some talent and who must have been in Arthur's ear about it.""  One wonders what might have happened if one of the more ""typical"" directors of such films as DEEP IN MY HEART had instead been assigned, but Donen's direction is smooth with a good transition in style between the biography portions and musical scenes.

The DVD of DEEP IN MY HEART (available exclusively in Warner's third boxset of Classic Musicals from the Dream Factory) comes with some great bonus material, including three rare deleted numbers.",1300752000,14,3531,4.9324324324324325

MGM drew on their extensive roster of super stars to tell the sorty of Sigmund Romberg. However, as the film was made in the 1950's, it does show its age somewhat, but then we do get a feel for Romberg's music, which makes up for that.
To my mind the most wonderful element is the absolutely stunning ballet performed by Cyd Charisse.  It was her performance which remained in my memory ever since I first saw the film those many years ago.  MGM did have the knack of staging this sort of ballet with great verve.  Now that I have my own copy of the film, I can watch Cyd again and again, and be thrilled every time.  That is not to say that the rest of the cast are not also great, but as they only get to perform a small portion from Romberg's many musicals, the viewer is left wishing there was more of the musical element.
Perhaps some tallented producer will view this film, and then film the Student Prince again, so we can all appreciate the tallent of Mr. Romberg.  I know MGM did film the Student Prince in the 1950's, but it was with a very poor cast, and so 'a not so memorable' film.

394569,5,630196778X,"Music (like time) changes constantly and continues to evolve (or devolve) with each generation. In the 1920s when Romberg produced his most successful plays, the Broadway show was in its early or formative stages (no pun intended). Operettas were popular in Vienna and Europe producing outstanding music in formulaic plays. Strauss (the younger), Smetana, Gilbert & Sullivan, Lehar and Kalman, to name a few, were hugely gifted and loved in their respective countries since they were giants of their craft. Their music is still loved today and classic.

Romberg, who studied engineering and musical composition in Vienna ultimately gravitated to the USA and produced musical plays such as The Student Prince, Blossom Time, The New Moon and The Desert Song. His music was delicious, well orchestrated, harmonious and a joy for singers and audience alike. His music was based on the Operetta form as were most shows on Broadway in the 1920s and early 1930s. His music is still loved today and classic.

One of the greatest actors of his time both on the screen and on Broadway  was Jose Ferrer. He was not considered by some, to be one of the nicest human beings in real life; but true or false, that is none of our concern. More importantly, absolutely no one could fault his dramatic performances and  achievements. He was the perfect acting chameleon. He portrayed Toulouse-Lautrec in Moulin Rouge, Cyrano de Bergerac (Oscar performance) and in this movie, Sigmund Romberg.

The combination of Romberg's music and Ferrer is an unbeatable match. The movie was a potpourri of Romberg's songs with an excellent cast and a parade of the matchless singing and dancing talent from the MGM Studio system. The story of Romberg's life is ""Hollywoodized"" but who cares? It is great entertainment.

The music of many of our country's great early composers is becoming progressively move difficult to find. By all means find this DVD and add it to you collection.",1203465600,,1952,5.0092592592592595
394570,5,630196778X,"This is almost pure ""schmaltz"" but it is still a gem.  It is a ""biography"" of Sigmund Romberg.  I have the VHS which I haven't watched for awhile so please forgive my memory.  It includes cameos of several MGM stars...the only one of which I can remember for certain at the moment is Howard Keel in a production number of YOUR LAND AND MY LAND FROM ""My Maryland"".  I'm sure that ""Stouthearted Men"" is included as well as something from ""The Desert Song""  It ends with ""I'll be seeing you""  I saw it when it first came out (1953ish) and bought the VHS as soon as I found it.  Hey...I remembered it after nearly 50 years.  Also starring is Helen Traubel, Metropolitan Opera Wagnerian soprano if the 1940's.  Incidentally, she was an American from (I think) St. Louis.",1199664000,,765,4.4855072463768115

394572,5,630196778X,"I saw this in the theater when it was first released and was enthralled with the music.  Like most ""biopics"" this one is long on entertainment and short on authenticity.  The recreations of Romberg's famous shows, with top stars of the day, are worth the price of admission all by themselves.  Add in one of the funniest routines ever filmed (Ferrer's acting out of ""Jazzadoo""), good performances by all the main actors and some of the best music ever written (in my humble opinion) and you have a great show.  If you want to learn the real facts about Sigmund Romberg, read about him.  If you want a good movie, rent this one.  It is now available on DVD as part of the ""Classic Musicals from the Dream Factory, Vol. 3"" collection.",1131321600,4,732,4.507575757575758
394573,3,630196778X,"This film is a curiosity more than anything else. I rented it years ago and found it uneven at best. Like most of MGM's alleged 'composer biographies,' it distorts the details of the composer's actual life (in this case, Broadway stage/operetta afficionado Sigmund Romberg) and hangs all of his magnificent songs on an all-star coatrack. And there lies the attraction: seeing Gene Kelly in his only on-screen appearance with real-life brother Fred; seeing Jose Ferrer's bride Rosemary Clooney in her fresh-faced beauty and ear-delicious voice; watching grande dame soprano Helen Traubel sing ""Aufwiedersen"" to a dying Merle Oberon; and most of all seeing Ann Miller blend the Charleston with her signature tap dancing (I'm not kidding) and superbabe Cyd Charisse in probably the single most erotic dance performed on film: an Arabian Nights-influenced duet with James Mitchell to the song ""One Alone."" And how she moves in that all-lace, form-fitting gown is anyone's guess.",1051833600,43,974,5.3311688311688314
394574,3,630196778X,"I'm conducting a wake for Rosemary Clooney  (Born May 23, 1928.  Died June 30, 2002.) I read ""Girl Singer: an autobiography"" and got the conveniently packaged ""Songs from the Girl Singer: a musical  autobiography "" CD set. Like Girranimals, the similarly titled pieces have the same picture on the front so that the purchaser will know that they go together.  I heartily recommend both.  But I can only give a mid-depth recommendation to ""Deep In My Heart."" Perhaps this is because of reading Rosemary's book and determining that the Star, Jose Ferrer, was a real-life scoundrel to her. And it may also have to do with my unfamiliarity with the Sigmund Romberg oeuvre. The joy and spectacle of the ""Specialty numbers"" with guest stars including Gene Kelley, Ann Miller (how does she even WALK in those super-high stilletos - let alone do that dazzling dance?,)Merle Oberlin's ""Camille""-like turn, Ferrer's Jolson-esque ""Jazza Do"" synopsis, and the piece de resistance: the ""Mr. And Mrs."" song and dance duet by Ferrer and his real-life newlywed bride, Rosemary Clooney, make this an Oldie worth renting, but  I'm not going to rush to buy a copy.",1030492800,7,1145,4.968586387434555
