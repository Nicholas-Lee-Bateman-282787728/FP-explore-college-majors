In the 8th season of it's wonderful, zany run, Red Dwarf seems to have lost much of the magic.  Even the return of the brilliant Chris Barrie could not save the overall  flat tone.
However, if you love Red Dwarf, Byte 2 will provide you with  some laughs. I like the introduction of psychotic Kill-Crazy, and Kryten's  sexual identity crisis (he is classified as a woman due to his incomplete  anatomy) makes me howl. Cassandra and Krytie TV are great episodes, and  watching the Dwarfers play basketball is classic. I wouldn't pass this one  up, but I would say it pales in comparison to the earlier seasons of Red  Dwarf.",966470400,,674,4.700854700854701
7911959,5,B00000JGF1,"Series VIII may not have the same amount of sci-fi action and drama that both series V and VI displayed, but it is still one of the funniest series yet!  I especially enjoyed ""Pete"", in which Rimmer and Lister  just can't stay out of trouble.  The ressurection of the crew and the  prison setting gives the show a fresh new atmosphere.",942019200,4,335,4.442622950819672
7911960,5,B00000JGF1,"I love Kryten and was thrilled he finally got to outsmart Lister after being his yes man for some  years. Though watching the English play basketball was a bit painful--Kosovo would have ended differently if  Slobodan and the team of his choice played against the Red Dwarf posse. The  writing is not as good as series 5 but I think it would be hard for anyone  to write shows of the quality of  ""Back to Reality"" and  ""Gunmen of the Apocolypse""  every season and every episode.",938476800,,478,4.488372093023256
