8635277,4,B00HRYH6TK,"A 1950s black and white film--not too long--about a notorious prison.  I think it's worth it if you like Westerns, prisoners of war films, or films about the history of prisons.",1505952000,,177,4.709677419354839

8635279,4,B00HRYH6TK,"This is a well-made, quite realistic film produced by Lippert company. Lippert films were often ceaply made, but this has a convincing prison milieu. This prison is really a hellish place. Its captain is Ward Bond who is not a jovial nice guy here. Just the opposite! I do not know why I do not like Sterling Hayden that much, but he is good actor. There is also James Arness in a fairly big role. This may be
B-picture by the budget, but it must be one of the best B-westerns. Money is really well-spent. Director Charles Marquis Warren was later producer of such great TV westerns as Virginian, Rawhide and Gunsmoke. He knows this business.",1404604800,6,642,4.543103448275862
