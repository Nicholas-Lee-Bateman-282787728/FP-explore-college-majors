8612813,3,B00F6YG9ZK,"Well told story with suspense pathos ignorant cops, unaware parents, bottles of pee, and a house with an appetite. Neighbors form bonds as they try to fathom the secrets of what motivates a house to consume kites and cars.

Then there is the great dialog ""That must be its uvula."" ""Oh it is a girl house.""

The film is animated which allows for many scenarios that are not physiologically possible. This actually adds to the spookiness. There is a socially relevant story with a positive ending.

However the there is nothing unique about the story or the characters. This makes it attractive for people that like formula films.",1497744000,,628,4.796296296296297
8612814,5,B00F6YG9ZK,"I have been very impressed with what I have seen from Sony 3D
animation thus far.  Following with my review of Cloudy with a
chance of Meatballs and Open Season, I am now find myself
back in familiar territory praising yet another Sony 3D title.

...but I need to ask, who did the filmmakers imagine they were making
Monster House for?  I don't think any young child would be able to sit
through this film.  This has got to be one of the scariest animated titles
I have ever seen -- especially with the 5.1 sound turned way up high.

So, let me give you the basics of the story.  A young pre-teen boy
named DJ (Mitchel Musso) lives across the street from a creepy
old house inhabited by a creepier old  Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve
Buscemi) who isn't overly fond of kids or their toys ending up on
his lawn.  A mishap involving DJ and his friend Chowder (Sam
Lerner) sends the old man into cardiac arrest.  DJ thinks he is a
murder.

Soon afterwards the house comes alive, seemingly possessed,
eating everything and everyone that comes into its path.  The boys
set out to find out what is at the heart of it all by setting forward a
plan to destroy the house before it destroys them.

Directed by Gil Kenan and with Executive Producers Robert
Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg, the film uses the same digital
capture process as The Polar Express. The result is very life-like
animation right down to facial expressions.  It's this kind of
animated realism that slaps on another layer of hair-raising
tingles.

This another perfect 3D experience for the new format.  Image
quality is pristine and deeply detailed.  There is a considerable
amount of depth here between bodies and background.  Because
the filmmakers designed this film for 3D viewing there is great use
of shots taken from above trees, behind branches, and down
through holes.  It really gives the viewer an outstanding sense
of realism.  This film falls ever-so-slightly behind the other two
Sony titles mentioned at the top of the review simply because
it feels like the older film it is.  I think the technology got a bit
better since its release.

The only major ghosting problems I saw happens in the final battle at
the end of the film.  There is so much animated action happening at
once that you begin to see double imaging in places.  It's kept to a minimum.

I fail to understand why there are no ""In Yo' Face"" moments.
There is certainly a lot of opportunity here to throw stuff at the
audience -- especially being a kids title -- but all the 3D stays
from within the confines of the screen.

What one must really do when watching this film is to turn the
audio up high.  The DTS-HD MA audio pounds away throughout
the film serving up an immense amount of sonic detail with
thunderous bass.  To top it all off, there are so many directional
effects that add eerie realism to the 3D.  You'll hear every creak
of the house while the flames of the furnace will seemingly
engulf you.  If you really want to scare the kids, put the emphasis
on the audio.

Included are 3D trailers for Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs and Open Season.

CONCLUSION

Sony wins again on the 3D front with a highly satisfying
release.  While I didn't think the film was as entertaining as Open
Season or Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs,  I do think that its
animation and first-rate 3D delivery make it a title worthy of purchase
consideration.",1453075200,2,3388,4.554635761589404
