7811413,5,6301329864,"The format of this ""instructional"" DVD is an interview, with Steve Gadd not only answering the questions, but demonstrating in response. While this is not as warm and personal as, say, Tommy Igoe's approach that is epitomized in his instructional ""Groove Essentials"" (ASIN B00064YTKM), it nonetheless gives you keen insights into Steve Gadd's techniques and underlying philosophies.

Material is wide ranging, covering every topic from how to apply basic drum rudiments into live playing, to bass drum technique, to time keeping and how to approach practicing.  A highlight is Steve's deconstruction of his drumwork on Paul Simon's ""Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover"", and the amazing discussion/demonstration of his four stick technique on Paul Simon's ""Late in the Evening"". The segment on Samba patterns is another part I especially liked on this video.

Other material includes how to approach recording sessions, breathing techniques, and how to quickly get the essence of a piece from charts - and Steve does strongly emphasize the importance of reading music.

I am a big fan of Steve Gadd and love this DVD because it both teaches and gives rare glimpses into his thoughts and approach.  Any drummer, Gadd fan or not, will learn a lot from this by watching it multiple times, letting the information sink in, and watching some more.  Even after a few dozen viewings something new will surface.",1101859200,31,1398,5.136563876651983
