8085592,4,B000BDH67Q,"The proceeds from this film's sale go to the Cambodian Women in Crisis organization that help resettle women who have been rescued from the trap of prostitution and the human trafficking business/racket, a trap that often involves disease and early death.

Like G. Thampy wrote, in a review elsewhere here, this film does an excellent job of portraying the factors that keep sex trafficking alive in third world countries. Against the backdrop of the tourism industry in Campbodia the film-makers weave a story that may well be the reality of the lives of many western tourists and Cambodian girls. It does a good job of depticting the financial and social tragedies that force women to join the sex trade and the abject economic situations or just bad karma of many involved.  They also show how the depravity of the foreign tourist, in cohort with local mafia, keep this horrible, vicious cycle profitable.

The film-makers showed marketed film's packaging so as to reach the mainstream dude-into-soft-porn and potential sex tourist audience - and educate them a bit, perhaps sparking some greater compassion and moral insight on themselves as protagonists in a world of have-nots that cater to the depravities of the haves.  Economic and/or physical enslavement is rife with realities of human misery, realities that would rain on the parade of the sex-tourist's own fantasy, if he bothered to inform himself and take charge of his mind.",1360454400,,1440,5.088983050847458
8085593,3,B000BDH67Q,"This is a well done film, with fine camera work and an unusual location - Cambodia. Frankly, there are few movies that have been shot in Cambodia since the horror shows of the 1970s, so that alone makes this worth the watch. The story is excellent. It deals with a Westerner who comes to Cambodia and ends up falling in love with a local prostitute with - yes - a heart of gold.

I recommend this film. It is misnamed (should be Monsoon Wife, or something like that) but ignore the title and watch the film.  It's worth it.",1256947200,4,523,4.2727272727272725
8085594,1,B000BDH67Q,"Don't let the title mislead you. It is not a drama about an Indian woman, but a cheap flick about a white man looking for ""thrills"" in Cambodia! This movie should have never been released on DVD!!!:x",1192233600,12,199,4.405405405405405
