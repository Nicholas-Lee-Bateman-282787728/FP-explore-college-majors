7997161,2,B0000AGWRK,"If you are a Latin American, you may find this film interesting; if not, you may find it boring and scattered. The movie is about a filmmaker who wants to make a documentary about crime in Mexico City and discovers that some of the crime is being done by corrupt policemen. He sets out to expose them with the help of some friends. The movie suffers from the way the story unfolds, teetering between a weak drama and a silly comedy.",1176595200,,432,4.345679012345679
7997162,4,B0000AGWRK,"This movie is well put together, and offers us a glimpse 9though movie is fictional) of governments corruption through power, especially in Latin America (though the US is not immune).",1176249600,,184,5.166666666666667
7997163,5,B0000AGWRK,"An unemployed filmmaker borrows his ex-wife's car.  He drives the car to an upscale restaurant for dinner with friends.  A gang of outlaws (corrupt police officers) take over the restaurant and rob all the customers.  In their getaway, the outlaws steal the filmmaker's ex-wife's car.

The police respond.  They promise to the victims and to the news media that there will be a swift apprehension of the outlaws.  The filmmaker knows better.  He's been doing a film documentary on the increasing crime rate in Mexico City and the impotence of the  police.

By chance one day, he spots his ex-wife's car.  He follows the car and he soon discovers who was behind the robbery at the restaurant and the theft of his ex-wife's car.  He goes to the police with the information; the same police who are the outlaws.  Since the police are the outlaws, they do nothing except cover their tracks.

In frustration with the police, the filmmaker begins to track the outlaws with his video camera.  He soon discovers that the police are the outlaws and he videos the corruption.  By exposing the corruption, he places  his friends and relatives at risk.  The filmmaker does whatever it takes to protect his friends and family; yet expose police corruption.  The police/outlaws will do whatever it takes to get the video and quiet the filmmaker.

This is a good cat-and-mouse type movie with an interesting storyline, good acting, and good editing and production.  It's a movie that you can see several times without getting bored.

There is a character in this movie, a police commander, who goes by the name ELVIS.  If there's a Mexican actor who can be compared to NICHOLAS CAGE, it's the actor who plays the part of ELVIS in this movie.",1093046400,30,1726,4.779661016949152
7997164,5,B0000AGWRK,"This is an amazing movie. It shows how life can be hard in Mexico city and how the diverse characters deal with it. As always, Demian Bichir has managed to show everyone what a great actor he is!",1083888000,6,195,4.157894736842105
7997165,5,B0000AGWRK,"This is an amazing movie, it makes you laugh and also realize how dangerous big cities can be. It is probably more appealing to people who have actually been to Mexico City or live there because they would understand how everything works. Great actors and a great plot.",1080950400,8,269,4.625
