8148352,1,B000J10EWO,Of course I haven't purchased this DVD but I want to review this dreadful item objectively.  Polar bears are absolutely adorable when cubs.  They are spectacular when adults. These precious creatures don't wantonly and irresponsibly reproduce the way we humans do. Nor do they destroy the environment the way we humans do.  Polar bears deserve all the suppoprt and respect they can get.  They deserve protection.,1241222400,,412,5.196969696969697
