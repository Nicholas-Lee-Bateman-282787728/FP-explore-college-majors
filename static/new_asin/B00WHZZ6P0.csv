7132359,5,B00WHZZ6P0,"It has all the episodes (meaning 1-12) and it's all English subbed. So, sadly, there is no English dub as of yet, but the subs are very well done so if that doesn't bother you, it's well worth the watch!
On an enjoyment level, I liked it very much. Pretty animation, funny, hot guys, it has what is expected from an anime based off an game.",1451779200,7,340,4.166666666666667
7132360,5,B00WHZZ6P0,"I absolutely adore this show. The characters all have their own little flaws explained in in their own episodes, yet the Gods traits and Yui's reactions to them are hilarious at the same time. Its based off of a PSP game which I haven't played but have seen, and while a bit different, it's still quite good and has similarities. I first saw it on Crunchyroll, but I strongly recommend getting the DVD because its heavily edited on other sites and I was very surprised by a lot of little things on the DVD that wasn't shown on Crunchyroll.",1451174400,5,539,4.454545454545454

8713488,5,B00WHZZ6P0,why the heck would anyone buy this when you can easily watch it free on kissanime.ru,1519516800,,84,4.3125
8713489,5,B00WHZZ6P0,"This series has quickly become one of my all time favorites. For someone who cannot speak or read Japanese very well (only a hand full of words atm), missing out on the game was quite a bummer. But this series is beautifully told and the artistry is amazing. The characters are all different, no two are the same, which makes things even better. I don't mind it being subbed at all, actually, it adds to the charm. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone.",1503619200,,449,4.421686746987952

8713496,4,B00WHZZ6P0,"I enjoyed it, it's funny and the art is beautiful-- but the ending left something to be desired.

I did my research after I bought and watched this and realized it's an anime adaptation of an otome game in Japan (it's not available in English currently) which explains the more ambiguous ending. To those not familiar with otome games, they are visual novels usually targeted at women where the main goal is to romance one of the male (sometimes female) characters in the story. As such, otome games usually have many different endings and that sufficiently explained why the anime ended the way it did since there would be no way to satisfy all the possible endings with one anime.

I would recommend this to female viewers in particular but I actually saw no reason that male viewers wouldn't enjoy it. There is plenty of action and humor, but you won't see too much ""fanservice"" in the way of scantily clad maids or characters with large breasts like a lot of the male-centric animes out there (I have no preference on this, but some do so I figured I'd note that for those who care one way or another.)",1454198400,5,1106,4.552763819095477
