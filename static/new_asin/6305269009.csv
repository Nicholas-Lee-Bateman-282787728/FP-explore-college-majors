7886263,5,6305269009,thanks my child loved it. Barney is one of the favorites in our home.  Maybe they can revise them on dvd.,1390608000,,105,4.0
7886264,4,6305269009,"This Barney video is pretty entertaining.  Barney and his friends go into town to deliver packages. They stop at different stores, and meet lots of people. It's a cute video.  I do think, however, its missing some of the charm of the other videos.  Maybe because Barney and his friends skip around to a lot of different places really fast.  My toddler really likes it though. The songs in it are cute also.",983145600,,406,4.52054794520548
7886265,2,6305269009,"As usual the singing and dancing is entertaining, but my daughter loses interest when they visit the people in the neighborhood (baker, hairdresser, etc.) as there is too much talking and too many adults. First  half is good. Rewind back to the beginning once they reach the baker.",960422400,3,281,4.854166666666667
