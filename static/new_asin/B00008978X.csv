1830608,5,B00008978X,"I have been so wrapped up in our current problems that I'd forgotten what was going on in this country less than 100 years ago. From the dust bowl to civil rights; from the world wars to the McCarthy witch hunts in the early 50's. This documentary, done candidly and from a view point that is up close, is a treasure of real history.

I can only guess that the people not affected by watching it are too young to have had relatives who went through it.

This will be on my top shelf of DVD's.",1248652800,3,492,4.114583333333333
1830609,5,B00008978X,"I've found this to be a wonderful documentary.  I was born in 1961, and this certainly filled in the gaps of history in my mind...of course, from one man's perspective, but what an education!!  Not many people have lived such an event filled life, and to be right there as things were happening in the world because of his job. I thought it was very interesting.",1248566400,2,362,4.46969696969697

1830626,5,B00008978X,"Walter Cronkite had a journalism career like none other. How much history one man reported on is astounding! I was glued to my seat, as each episode played through, to see how much one man experienced. how he worked with the technology of the time to get out the news was entertaining to see. His type of honest journalism is now lost in today's obvious bias reporting in the media. He carries himself with integrety and character that is also lost today. A true gentleman and statesman.",1269043200,,487,4.609195402298851
1830627,2,B00008978X,"This box set was disapointing in a way that will be tediously familiar to anyone who collects documentaries-Crap video.
All the more unforgivable when you consider that the ancient news footage looks better than the murky scenes of the cronk
in front of the fire shot for the series.",1265846400,,283,4.795918367346939
1830628,5,B00008978X,This is an excellent review of history over the course of Cronkite's life.  It covers the major events with him offering personal insite and comments.  I purchased it for my dad who is 81 years old.  This period of history basically mirrors his life and he really enjoyed it.,1264809600,,275,4.571428571428571
1830629,5,B00008978X,This is a great DVD set for anyone who enjoys an honest look back to our history!  Walter Cronkite was an amazing journalist and this DVD is a compilation of some of his best work!,1261785600,,180,4.142857142857143
1830630,5,B00008978X,"I am not an American, nor have I directly lived the times and places of Walter Cronkite, but the Man and his face were unique throughout the world.

A Gentleman amongst journalists, a crooner, one of those rare examples of people, who do their homework before sitting or standing in front of a camera.
A man who risked his life going through the Hell of War, a man who knew the people he was talking about, a man who went deeper into the facts, in order
to report with accuracy the events of his times.

One can tell at a glance why this man became a true icon in not just American, but international television making.

It is so rewarding to see that someone still remembers people like Walter Cronkite, especially in a day and age, in which people don't even seem to remember who Neil Armstrong is and was.

I don't own this set as yet, but being by and about Walter Cronkite, can only mean true and lived history told by a man who knew what he was talking about.

He left a mark in his trade.

Alas, younger generations of journalists have decided not to follow in his footsteps, preferring just the glamorous sides of the News and the easier side of the trade, not to speak the monetary compensations that come with this kind of television products.

I can only wish that the future will see a younger generation of ""crooners"", following into the footsteps of this great man.
Working hard, researching with accuracy and being specific about what they report.

If wishes were horses...

I can recommend anything involving Walter Cronkite. His name is a Brand for quality and seriousness.

I, we, all miss him and other colleagues like him, who helped make Television a respectable and believable stage for serious News.

Bring back those days and turn them into a new age of Television making...",1254096000,6,1798,4.570093457943925
1830631,5,B00008978X,My daughter was studying the Vietnam War is Social Studies.  We had watched Walter Cronkite c.d.'s at home.  She decided to take them to school and ask the teacher if they could watch some of it in class.  They did and those 13/14 yr old students enjoyed it.  That says it all!,1253750400,3,277,4.269230769230769
1830632,5,B00008978X,"I had watched all of the episodes on TV and was absolutely overwhelmed by the depth of Cronkite's involvement in history.  He didn't just report it...he lived it.  He was my favorite newscaster for all of the years that he was on TV, but I had no concept of his background.  I bought one for myself and one each for my 30-something son and daughter (as Christmas gifts). As a history buff, I know of no better way to provide a valuable history lesson.  Unfortunately, we will not see this type of hands-on newscasting again.  Our nation's loss!",1253577600,5,544,4.510204081632653
1830633,5,B00008978X,"The tin box-packaging is fitting: this is an unusual memento of the 20th century, made more poignant by the recent passing of the wonderful host, Walter Cronkite.

If you are a history buff, you will love Cronkite's retrospective as he traces the events of the century that he lived through and reported on (complete with his own personal reflections and memories of historic events--from World War I to the landing on the moon.)

This is a reminder of what the world used to be--AND what good broadcast journalism used to be.

We may not miss the past, but we all are less for the loss of Cronkite. Get this dvd set and share history--and knowledge of a great journalist--with your children. Let them see what broadcast radio and television was like before the days of Beck and Limbaugh and Hannity and O'Reilly.

They will thank you.",1253232000,10,835,4.698630136986301

7980317,5,B00008978X,Nobody could possibly do a better job than Cronkite does narrating the history of the 20th century,1494460800,,98,4.823529411764706
7980318,5,B00008978X,"Walter Cronkite was an American journalist who most famously was the head anchor of CBS Evening News from 1962 to 1981. He spent most of his professional career in journalism and his recognition to the American public through television and commitment to honest and non-biased journalism earned him the reputation of ""the most trusted man in America.""

The series presented on this DVD set was originally produced in 1997 and features Cronkite reflecting on his career up to that point and the various historical events and people he was witness to. This started out most prominently with covering the events of World War II. His career and standing as a highly respected newsman gave him the opportunity to cover some of the most momentous events of the twentieth century. This includes the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Moon landings, the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal, among many others. The series features narration by Cronkite himself along with archival footage covering the many events. Cronkite not only offers a summary of this history, but also his own viewpoints and opinions.

In conclusion, this series is sure to be enjoyed by those that are interested in American history as told by one of the greatest reporters of the twentieth century.",1479772800,,1264,5.072115384615385

7980323,5,B00008978X,This DVD is a must own for History lovers.  Walter Cronkite cronicles his lifetime of history and career.  His reporting is so insightful and includes actual footage of events.  The review helped me to understand the flow of life's patterns through my parents lives and most of mine.  It is an important set to have in anyone's library.,1344902400,,336,4.741379310344827
7980324,3,B00008978X,"I am richly enjoying the first part of the series because it offers such easy pickings for identifying how the atheist elite conquered America through talented liars with soothing voices.

As expected, Cronkite harps on the Nixon Watergate episode, all while omitting the far greater series of crimes committed by Clinton (such as stealing FBI files and using them on enemies).

And let us never mention the rape accusation against Bill Clinton by Juanita Broaddrick, along with charges of sexual harassment by others that were hushed up in the press.

Clinton also declared war on Serbia, a Christian nation, to help the Albanian Muslims (a group labeled even by the Clinton State Department as terrorist) take over the province of Kosovo. Much later of course, Barack Obama would follow by handing much of the Middle East to Muslim loons.

Certainly none of the propaganda merchants bothered telling audiences about their president because he was an abortion-loving, gay-is-cool, hate-the-conservatves, help-destroy the country general for them.

Cronkite makes a hero out of his fellow liars, playing them up for daring to ""report"" during rough weather or hostilities. Forget the equivalent wages of more than a million per year received by the so-called heroes.

These are the people who destroyed America.

When opposed, they turn the simple minds of liberal idiots against anyone daring to speak truth, such as Joseph McCarthy, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage and Fox News.

Politicians opposing the Marxist objectives had their lives destroyed, and still do if taking into account Sarah Palin, Herman Cain and numerous others. All the while, the demonic minions who call themselves Democrats dismantled freedom and self-reliance one stone at a time.

At any rate, it is easy to copy parts of the Cronkite propaganda and self-congratulatory banquet for use in future commentary videos to show on youtube (randalusa). So for that much I am grateful getting such clear and easily accessible examples of this man's deceitfulness all in one location.

As for history, avoid the Marxist liars at his old network, CBS, along with NBC, NPR and ABC. They've got Comedy Central, MTV and more channels too. Let us add in the notorious fountains of deceit at The New York Times and Washington Post.

Somehow the global elite took over all of the major news and entertainment networks many many years ago, then ""led"" the people to their utopian vision of a wonderful world with no God and the government first teaching your children, then forcing them to behave the right way.

And the parents, shame on you for going to sleep in a happy world of constant entertainment, then allowing your children to be outright lied to in government schools about slavery, the founding fathers, Joseph McCarthy, Global Warming, a childlike stupid theory of life created for no reason.

We are a dead nation, having followed Europe and Canada. The Humanist Marxist elite put the plan into effect. The people willingly went along, living their years by emotions rather than strength and conscience.

I gave the project a rating of 3 because Cronkite performs rather well, like usual, in presenting the deceitful version of history. For anyone dumb enough to believe the liars in the news world (Jon Stewart too), you will acquire a quick wrap-up of the information they want the idiots to believe.",1341446400,3,3373,5.086956521739131
