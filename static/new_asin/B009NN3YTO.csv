8543115,5,B009NN3YTO,"I used to be very active in sports, but since college and after (I'm just under 27 now) I haven't done much exercising. I tried treadmills and ellipticals some, but I couldn't stay motivated. After a lot of searching for a fun, positive, modest cardio workout on DVD I ended up asking for this DVD set for Christmas. I also got a good quality step at the same time, as I didn't own one, and the Step Pump DVD was the one I especially thought I would like. I LOVE it.  I also have been pleased to find I am readily using the Pure Pump as well, in addition to parts of the others. Haven't gotten to the Pre-natal on yet, but I'm excited to have that for when I need it. These DVDs are just what I was looking for. I do recall reading somewhere else (when I was researching these), that someone complained that Tonya Larson does not explain moves well enough before they happen. I did find that I had to watch it several times to do moves correctly, and I would focus on segments to get them down, slowly adding in more. It has been slightly over a month and a half now since using these (and I use them about three times a week), and I have successfully managed to learn the entire step segment routine of Pure Pump. I enjoy it a lot. Hope this review helps you decide whether this will work for you or not :-)",1455321600,2,1308,4.149606299212598

Really appreciate the positive tone provided by Tonya's faith and especially the modesty and realistic, healthy body shapes that are demonstrated. Beginner and advanced options challenge me to improve",1413072000,,375,5.064516129032258
