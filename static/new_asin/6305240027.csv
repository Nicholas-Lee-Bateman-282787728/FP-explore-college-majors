Actor driven films are increasingly difficult to find on the Twenty-first Century movie marquees, and ""YOUR FRIENDS & NEIGHBORS"", delves deeply into the heart of intimate relationships, revealing the ill-ease of acceptance of some of our most precious decisions---guarded frankness---et al. Every Thespian does a fine job of living the life of their character, leaving little unexplored, and some often awkwardly hilarious moments.

1001000,5,6305240027,"The Bottom Line:

An intense and unsparing film from Neil LaBute, who was quite a writer/director before he did The Wicker Man, Your Friends & Neighbors is a must-watch for anyone who likes their dramas unformulaic, unmanipulative, and depressing; with its excellent acting and surprisingly depth of character, YF&N is an underseen gem.

1001001,3,6305240027,"""Your Friends and Neighbors"" (1998) is the second film by director/writer Neil LaBute and it tells the story of three couples and their complicated friendships and relationships. I've seen it more than once during the last couple of days - and I found it incredibly clever written, well acted (especially by Jason Patric and Catherine Keener - their only scene together was the second best in the movie - so dynamic and tight) and skillfully directed. LaBute certainly has a very unique sense of humor and he knows well the history of cinema. To give all characters the names that rhyme - Mary, Barry, Terri, Cheri, Cary and Jerry - was a clever idea - the characters are interchangeable in their relationships and it does not matter really, who is with whom - Mary with Barry or with Cary or Jerry or Barry with Barry, and Cheri with Terri or Jerry? The important thing is that they are selfish and often unpleasant and despicable people who are not happy with themselves and can't make happy their spouses or partners. Another interesting trick - the repeating scene in the Art gallery that starts with exactly the same words for each character but leads to different developments. I mentioned that LaBute knows his movies. Have you noticed the poster from Goddard's Le Mpris, (1963) aka ""Contempt"" with Brigitte Bardot? ""Contempt"" features one of the most fascinating and longest scenes of a breakup ever filmed. The breakup scene between Terri (Catherine Keener) and Jerry (Ben Stiller) started like in ""Contempt"" but it only lasted a few minutes and it was a good scene. Actually, I loved all scenes with Catherine Keener and if I have to choose one character that I liked, it would be Terry. Seems that Charlie Kaufman might have seen LaBute's movie because Terry and Maxine from ""Being John Malkovich"" have a lot in common. I was actually waiting for Terry to say to Jerry, ""The thing is if you ever get me, you would not know what to do with me"".

Jason Patric was a revelation - I don't know him very well but I remember that he gave a very good performance in ""Narc"". As for the scene in a steam room, it is not just the best of the film; it is one of the best scenes - monologues ever. I know not many would agree with me but the scene is as powerful, unforgettable and strangely erotic as the monologue in Bergman's ""Persona"". LaBute's writing, his camera, and mesmerizing performance by Patric made this scene an instant classic.

The film is not perfect and sometimes it drags but overall I found it interesting and enjoyable. You don't have to like the characters in order to like and appreciate the film. Sadly, the beautiful, sensual and talented Nastassja Kinski (Cherri) does not have much to play while Ben Stiller does and I am not his fan - even in this film.

LaBute's usage of ""Metallica""s ""Enter Sandman"" (performed by Apocalyptica) during the opening and the closing credits instantly pulled me in and Bryony Atkinson's song ""My Hollow"" is terrific.

1001002,4,6305240027,"Yeah, what to really say about ""Your Friends And Neighbors"", kind of an all star cast, and definately not what to expect in a movie. I think it really portrays the weaknesses that all of us go through in day to day life. It's really just a matter of whether or not you give into these weaknesses. Throughly enjoyed it, and bought it so I could lend it to other people and show them that you don't have to blow up things on the big screen in order to be riveted!!!",1167782400,,463,4.0989010989010985

Stiller and Keener aren't having the greatest marriage. During Sex, Keener doesnt like Stiller to yell things and say things. Eckhart and Brenneman are also having trouble and when they have sex, when Eckhart wants to talk to her, she cant say anything. So, Stiller then has an affair with Brenneman and Eckhart doesnt know about it until Stiller tells him. On the other line, Stiller's wife Keener is having a lesbian affair with Kinski, the art gallery assistant because she knows that Stiller is having his own affair. Last but not least, there's Patric, who is so obsessed with himself he even records himself saying sexual things in a voice recorder, he listens to it while he does crunches...hmm, ok. This is anchored by the cast, they do a damn good job but this has no point and being that the cast is good, it doesnt matter. The women look sexy and gorgeous and Patric is dead on target with his role. ""Is this part of the gallery or another collection?""",1131840000,2,1328,4.778260869565218
1001004,2,6305240027,"Im confused. Are we supposed to like anyone in this movie? Are we supposed to believe that these people hung together long enough to fall apart in the time frame of this movie? The only character I even remotley liked was Cary (Jason Patrick) because he was such a complete vilain. Never once did he deviate from exactly the person he portrays. He is utterly dispicable, and in the scene where he reveals his best sexual experience to his friends Berry and Jerry, any posibility of liking or relating to the character is hopefully destroyed. All that aside, Cary accomplishes one task in this movie, other than atracting our enmity. He confronts Jerry's girlfriend (Terry?), and completely destroys her in the span of a single nasty sentence. You see, from the beginning, we understand that's she's completely self absorbed, and doesn't care about anybody. Cary is excessive, but that's also in keeping with his character, so somehow he's absolved, right?

So this movie is supposed to be dark is it? Well, okay fine, but here's the problem with that approach. When you isolate the characters from the audience to such a degree, anything dark they do loses its impact  because we can no longer relate to them anymore. All I wanted to see was bad things happen to everyone in this movie, without acception. That may sound dark on my part, but they started it.

This movie is basically about 2 a--holes, and 3 cowards. 2+3= why am I watching this? Is this really a slice of the American social experience? Because I don't know anybody like this. Maybe the people I can't stand being around live like this, but that doesn't mean I want to watch a movie about them either. Two stars are given because at least this movie engaged me on an emotional level, but if I want to watch a bunch of people I can't stand, I'll watch the news. Read that how you like. Sure this movie is dark, but there's nothing organic about it, so it ends up feeling contrived, and ultimately pointless.",1123027200,11,1973,4.64756446991404

The film itself offers some interesting dialogues as it dissects the characters and their lustful needs for each other.  As these needs are examined it is evident that what has surfaced is not always what is sought after, and in the absence of what is desired it is understandable that happiness is not obtained.  Your Friends & Neighbors is a small film with a small cast that analyzes the question of what people think they want and what people really want.

1001008,3,6305240027,"The movie is not boring and the acting is good, but these are about the only good things I can say about this film. All in all this is not an easy film to watch and it leaves you with an unpleasant feeling, as if you have been part of something very repulsive. I have to add that the movie is, in some peculier way, thought provoking.
This is a story of six, very self centered people, who seem to be participating in the ""ugly personality of the year"" competition. No relationship of any kind - be it a married couple, friendship between two men or women -. is compassionate or meaningful. It seems that every character lives in a world of his own and manipulates other people for his own needs. Even the seemingly ""weak"" characters are understood by the end of the movie, to have been playing a game of their own where ""weakness' is only a mean to achieve their purposes.
This is a story of a couple - Aaron Eckhart playing a very needy husband, endlessly showering his wife with gifts, who seems to be living his life through the stories of his doctor friend. He himself is having sexual problems with his wife, played by Amy Brenneman, who starts out as the nicest character in the movie. The wife however has her own agenda and by the last scene of the movie her perception is totally changed. The wife is having an affair with Ben Stiller, the husband's best friend. Stiller lives with a girlfriend, Catherine Keener - but this fact, or even his affair with Amy Brenneman does not stop him from picking up any woman in the neighborhood. Ben stiller is a drama teacher and it seems he likes a bit of drama in his everyday life. Catherine Keener is a tough independent character. She does not like her boyfriend talking during sex, and on the whole is perceived by the male characters in the story as a sort of emasculating woman.  She is definitely doing her best not to be nice but by the end of the movie, you might argue that the people surrounding her do deserve her attitude.
The doctor, a friend of the two men (this is the one character that probably wins the ugly character competition) is obsessive about sexual power. The bed is some sort of a boxing arena for him where men and women fight to prove their power.  Two memorable scenes in the movie are connected to the doctor - the first shows the doctor talking on the phone and meanwhile playing football with a fetus doll, throwing it around the room in what seems to be an accurate capture of his attitude towards the female sex (and its offsprings)- what an irony it is to see him in the last scene of the movie - about to become a father. The other memorable scene is filmed in the sauna where the doctor gives a long confession about a sickening sexual encounter he glorifies as his best sexual act. The viewer is torn between his wish to throw up and the amazing act of Jason Patric.
Nastassja Kinski is the last character. A confused needy artist assistant who falls in love with Catherine Keener. She is beautiful as ever, and her frail and different looks add to her role.
What makes this film so revolting is the lack of all human compassion, friendship, true love - all the elements of what we perceive as good qualities of human beings --- nothing here, just pure egotism and alienation between people.",1059004800,6,3281,4.430463576158941
1001079,1,6305240027,"This is the movie about the meanest, cruelest, most socially unpleasant people ever. One could view it as dark comedy, but there is nothing funny about it. Characters move from one unbearable monologue to another, some even repeating scenes, while in the meantime nothing really happens in the story. I hope I never meet the person who actually identified with this movie. This is a film where respectable actors (Ben Stiller and Jason Patric among others) play entirely uninteresting characters and do it believably. The acting is very good in ""Your Friends and Neighbors,"" but that doesn't change the fact that the film should never have been made. For what seems like ages, the film lags on with uninvolving dialogue that wants may seem intelligent, but only to the people saying it. The documentary ""Trekkies"" is about devoted fans to ""Star Trek"" who dress up at conventions and spend large amounts of money on the silliest things. Watching that movie, one might wish they would ""get a life."" While watching ""Your Friends and Neighbors,"" I realized those Trekkies have much better lives than the characters in this movie. Maybe ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" is trying to make a point. Maybe it's really a commentary about people using sex to get power. The problem is, there's no glimmer of hope in this movie. There are no uplifting moments, no tender scenes, and no interesting characters. There is nothing to enjoy about this film. It's unpleasantly explicit and very, very boring. I suppose there was a point to this film. My point is that it shouldn't have been made.",1053043200,6,1575,4.902621722846442
1001080,4,6305240027,"by any stretch of the viewers' imagination!  Director Neil LaBute does not seek to entertain, but to expose, in this morality play, I think.
There are six players in the film version of social-sexual arrogance.  Initially, you view them with varying degrees of interest, but by the end of the film, you dislike all of them, some more than most.
LaBute, with slightly more budget than he had for his breakthrough debut, ""In the Company of Men"" (ICM), uses it wisely to attract excellent role-players, then films it well, in all indoor, and slightly claustrophobic settings.  He continues his theme of the cruelty of the alpha male, to both the other sex, and his own male friends.
Although each of the actors plays well (I particularly liked Aaron Eckhart, playing against type and doing a ""180"" from his role in ICM, as a poorly groomed, chubby and needy husband and friend) there is no question that the film is sought out by film afficianados to observe the performance of Jason Patric.
From the opening scene, Patric makes your skin crawl at the depths of his ability to hate the fairer sex.  His hold over Stiller & Eckhart's characters is resonant in the fascinating steam room scene.  Patric, deliberately cruel, is self-assured enough to fall into reverie about his infliction of power in a past homosexual rape.  His intensity and believability make you wonder why Colin Farrell is getting all the good roles when Patric is a far more powerful actor.
In this film, LaBute does not exceed his earlier work (ICM) but puts us on warning that he is a force to be reckoned with in filmmaking.
A caution; most filmgoers will abhor this film.  My recommendation is to see it for the experience, not the entertainment.",1051228800,21,1718,4.764309764309765
1001081,5,6305240027,"I have recommended this film to everyone I meet, and I'm almost to the point where I can do Jason Patric's ""Sauna"" monologue perfectly, but in the end, it's a film that illustrates how we still don't know how to communicate with one another. Especially the opposite sex. And in Neil Labute's world as in the real world: The snake always wins.",1047945600,,342,4.532258064516129
1001082,4,6305240027,"This film follows the interrelations of six ""friends"" as they grope for self-fulfillment, usually at each other's expense.  This is a grim, often ugly exploration of selfishness, featuring characters that somehow never developed the sense of empathy or generosity that enables one human being to connect with another on more than a superficial level.  They equate being happy with being in a position of power over others wherein they are able to gratify their urges of the moment.  When their behavior fails to make them happy, they become more jaded and sad and convinced that happiness is only a fantasy.  A possible exception is the chilling sociopath played by Jason Patric, who appears to be entirely satisfied with his reprehensible conduct.  In a cast of dislikable characters, he emerges as one of the most loathsome figures I have ever seen in a film.  Perhaps not coincidentally, he is also the alpha among the film's male characters.
Director/writer Neil LaBute's dialogue is sharp and telling.  This is a serious and courageous exploration of the dark side of human nature.",1041638400,7,1086,5.067415730337078
1001083,2,6305240027,"comes a movie with not much of a plot, but plenty of selfish people who only care about sex.  While there is much talk about it there aren't many sex scenes.  The discussions here are more frank and graphic than the act itself.
I caught this on Independant Film Channel, and actually had my hand on the remote control and ready to change it at several scenes, but kept it on.
The entire film centers around six people that are all connected in some way, and they are all extremely self absorped people who will stop at nothing for their tiny chance of any happiness.
Except one, Nastassja Kinski, she plays this artist assistant who develops a sexual relationship with Catherine Keener's character. The dialogue and direction are all the same in the ""introduction"" of every character to Kinski's, and well, it was good for a chuckle.  Which you needed in this film, due to the general direction it took -- which was Narcissism at its worst.
Jason Patric, who now is forever embedded on my brain as this woman hating but sex loving jerk, was mind blowing in this movie.  There is one particular scene where he monologues and the nature of the talk is very difficult to stomach.  It was like listening to a psychopath justify his crimes.
I am a very open minded person, and i think that is what you need to be to watch this movie.  It reminded me of the movie ""Happiness"" in that respect.  There is a film that is just utterly sick, but what's sicker is that some of it is actually funny.  So, if you liked ""Happiness"", chances are you will like this as well.
Ben Stiller and Amy Brenneman(of the show, Judging Amy) are the only other actors I recognized.  The other actor Aaron Eckhart appeared in the first movie of director Neil Labute's 'In the Company of Men', which I haven't seen.
The acting is very well done, but the subject matter itself just isn't for everyone.  It certainly isn't something one(at least anyone I know) has to be in the mood for to watch.
It is a disturbing piece of work that I don't recommend.  There is nothing redeeming about the characters and it leaves us all hanging.",1034899200,5,2100,4.5
1001084,4,6305240027,"""Your Friends and Neighbors"" is a dark, risque comedy about five people who are so self-centered that their ability to have a meaningful relationship is limited, at best. The movie doesn't always work, but when it does, it's brilliant. It also suffers by comparison to writer-director Neil LaBute's much admired first effort, In the Company of Men.
LaBute contends that egocentric people are, in many ways, very much alike. In fact, he named his characters Mary, Barry, Terri, Cherri, Gary and Jerry. Such people, he says, are not only obsessed with getting their own way, but also tend to want the same things over and over again. Since no one can give them these things, they are never satisfied.
Jerry [Ben Stiller] is a drama teacher who has an affair with his best friend's wife, Mary [Amy Brenneman]. While the affair ends practically before it begins, it causes Jerry's girlfriend, Terri [Catherine Keener], to have an affair with Cherri [Natassja Kinski]. Mary's husband, Barry [Aaron Eckhart], does a lot of soul searching, which always ends in his asking, ""Is it me?"" Meanwhile, the totally vain doctor, Gary [Jason Patric], stirs up this brew as much as he can, because other people's flaws keep him from dealing with his own, which are major. Their stories are both funny and sad.
LaBute directs in the style of realism, which means his performers act very much as people in real life would. There are a lot of conversational pauses and blank looks to show that no one is really comprehending what others are saying. Many viewers will find this irritating. We have been brainwashed by Hollywood's glossy, perfect characters who bond with one another by tossing off witless one-lines and cliches. Or they make a short, noble speech, and everything is cozy again. Life, of course, ain't that simple. If it were, we could get through it in two hours.
Your Friends and Neighbors is low budget. It sometimes seems like a filmed play. The actors are an ensemble, and several have worked with LaBute before. They are all very good. Especially interesting are Jason Patric and Ben Stiller, who, despite their commercial successes, remain true actors. Patric was spellbinding last year in Incognito, as was Stiller in Zero Effect. [These were two of 1998's very best independent films and worth adding tou your DVD collection.]
This movie is recommended for people who take movies seriously, at least from time to time. It is the type of film which can not be called an entertainment, but which stays with the viewer long after the big but trite pictures have faded from memory.",1017187200,4,2581,4.881548974943052
1001085,4,6305240027,"This is Neil LaBute's more lavish but no less vitriolic follow-up to ""In the Company of Men"".  Whereas that film had a documentary sense of realism to it, this one feels very much like a play.  Although nothing mystical happens, there's a sense of surreality that coats this film.  From the opening music, an oddly appealing version of Metallica's ""Enter Sandman"" played on four cellos by a quartet called Apocalyptica, to the main titles, which are superimposed over a sedate Alex Katz print called ""The Cocktail Party"", we enter a world of wealth and culture.  Only under the glossy surface beats a soulless heart.
Witness an early dinner scene.  Two couples meet at one's swanky townhouse, exchange pleasantries and share glasses of wine.  The women are smartly dressed.  The men are too (one of them laments a spill on his new doeskin jacket).  But they never connect in a tangible way.  Until, that is, an offer of infidelity is confidentially proffered.  The movie uses this moment to jump off into a world where everyone (but one) appears stable but all are ineffectual and socially retarded.  This point is further driven home by a series of scenes set in an art gallery, where each character uses the same verbatim small talk with an artist's assistant to expose significant aspects of their character.  They're artificial moments, but delicately set up the tone of the film.  The cast is uniformly excellent, if not overly mannered, which further helps create the feeling that you're watching a play rather than a film.  Ben Stiller's character represents this the best, not just because he's a drama professor.  He is erudite and articulate when ""performing"", such as when lecturing his students, or giving a tour of a museum.  But when he gets into social situations, Stiller fails to complete a single one of his thoughts.  Most of his sentences trail off, ending with the question ""You know?"" or just a resigned sigh.  It's an evocative (if a touch shallow) character trait, but damn if it doesn't get annoying by film's end.  I had this intense desire to slap Ben good.
Aaron Eckhart sports a $2 haircut, a cheesy moustache, and a bulging gut.  He's playing a character exactly opposite to his toxic Chad from ""In the Company of Men"", and it's amazing that one man can pull off both roles.  Eckhart has proven himself to be a marvelous chameleon-like actor, easily filling out the pathetic and needy sap LaBute has written for him here.
Jason Patric gets the toxic role this time, playing a misogynistic obstetrician (he's prone to playing football with a model of a fetus).  His stories of extreme behaviour ""amuse"" his friends.  One involves sending a retributive note to an ex-girlfriend on doctor's stationary, informing her that she may be HIV-positive.  Another, in the scene that the film will be forever known for, involves high school hijinks in the gym shower with a bullied boy named Timmy.  Patric wrings every bit of wickedness from this story, told in one incredibly long close-up take.  It's a powerful little moment that leaves the audience (not to mention the other characters in the scene) exclaiming, ""What the heck was that?""
Catherine Keener, so energetic in ""Being John Malkovich"", is much more subdued here.  But you can feel her frustration bubbling up beneath the service (she's Stiller's girlfriend, and is as fed up with him as the audience is).  Keener is a very self-aware actress, knowing when to go full throttle and when to pull back.  Hers is not the showiest role in the film, but it ranks right up there with the most memorable.
Nastassja Kinski is used the least of the six main actors (author's note: Come to think of it, there are only six speaking parts in the whole movie, making the theatrical nature of the piece even more profound).  And it's probably for the best.  She is fetching, but doesn't bring much more to the role than quiet neediness.
Amy Brenneman plays Eckhart's wife, and has an affair with Stiller.  She stays nervous and reticent throughout the movie, never giving in to her boredom or frustration even when the moment calls for a little blow-up.  In the beginning she passes for the innocent moral centre of the film, but by the end she is the one most corrupted.  Brenneman does well playing both sides of this coin.
Writer/Director LaBute appears to have learned much since ""Men"".  He's more confident using close-ups to get in his characters' faces.  And the film looks luscious bathed in warm autumnal hues.  The story, such as it is, is told through a series of vignettes, each tellingly juxtaposed with the next to subtly portray the differences between men and women.  A scene of three women talking about sex over lunch is followed by one of three men in a steam room pondering the same subject, in a cruder manner.  And though there is no real narrative thrust, the individual scenes themselves are propulsive enough to keep the viewer interested.",993427200,8,4931,4.825
1001086,5,6305240027,"Neil LaBute's ""Your Friends And Neighbors"" is to our time what Choderlos Laclos'novel ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" was to 18th century France: an unsparing, jet-black look straight into the bottomless abyss that results when an era's worst social aspects intersect with its sexual appetites. In the France of 1782, the social trigger was the unearned, unrestricted privileged position of the aristocracy, which bred the kind of steel-hard arrogance that makes the manipulation of innocent people through heartless sex not only possible, but a source of diversion to the two main characters. In LaBute's masterpiece (which makes earlier ""candid"" American films about sex such as ""Carnal Knowledge"" and ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" look like kindergarten primers by comparison),we are faced with that most familiar of modern creatures, the Professional Man (and Woman) Without Qualities. That is to say, people who have plenty of money, decent material prospects, and absolutely no beliefs or convictions about any principle whatever, whether it is the sanctity of marriage vows or the loyalty due to friendship. The essence of this spiritually arid life is captured to perfection when the Eckhart and Patric characters meet in the diner, and Eckhart wonders offhandedly whether they will ever be made to own up to the consequences of the things they do. Perhaps in some hypothetical afterlife, says Patric -- but ""the interim belongs to me"".The scene in which he (Patric)terrorizes the Catherine Kenner character in the bookstore is one which any of the great playwrights who have dealt with sexual material (Williams, Wedekind,Strindberg, etc.)would have been pleased to write. Just as it is said of some con men that they regard any other person's having money in their pocket as a personal affront,Patric cannot endure the thought that there is any woman, anywhere, who would not want him, if given the chance. In addition, he displays the age-old view of (some) men that women are essentially intruders into the realm of male bonding and camaraderie, and should be slapped down.(His comment to her that he ""cares about"" the Stiller character, with whom she lives,and whom she is allegedly making unhappy, is patent nonsense; what he means is that he can use his ""friendship"" with Stiller as an alibi for cutting loose on her.)It is this same ravenous egoism that makes it possible for him to do what should, on the surface, be the last thing that a renowned straight stud would ever do: not only admit to his two closest male associates to having engaged in a homosexual rape,but to having derived PLEASURE from it. He takes it for granted that whatever reservations they may have about the homosexual aspect will be drowned in their unspoken agreement that power over a helpless victim is the ultimate aphrodisiac -- and he is quickly proven right. LaBute's characters do not(the gods be praised!)represent the whole truth about modern life; but,like the heartlessly mocking quartet on ""Seinfeld"", they do account for an uncomfortably large portion of it. This blackest of black comedies is more than just a splendid film; it is a barometer of its time.",987811200,4,3152,5.146198830409356
1001087,5,6305240027,"Director Neil LaBute's follow up to In the Company of Men which is almost as pessimistic, ugly, misanthropic and still intelligent, thought provoking and different from all the other movies out there. Aaron Eckhart makes an amazing and almost unrecognisable transition from sly, conniving, pretty boy Chad in In the Company to the overweight, bumbling, devoted husband with erectile problems in Your Friends and Neighbours. Amy Brenneman portrays his frustrated wife who eventually ends up pursuing an affair with their friend, an actor and acting teacher played by Ben Stiller. Stiller lives with his girlfriend, a writer who is sharp-witted but not the nicest person in the world. She is played stunningly by Catherine Keener. She has problems with people talking at all during sex, so she is angry and turned off by Stiller who wants to talk all the time. This drives Stiller into the arms of Brenneman. When their crucial moment arrives, however, he, like her husband, cannot perform. Keener, meanwhile, has started an affair with another woman, played by Nastassja Kinski (who looks more beautiful now than she ever did in her teens and early twenties). Beyond all of this, Stiller and Eckhart are close friends who have a third close friend, a seemingly psychotic doctor played by Jason Patric. Patric is a lot like Chad from In the Company of Men. He treats women like they are objects, is highly misogynistic, but he seems to hate people overall. His personality is extreme, confrontational and cruel, but you can say for him that he is his own person. He justifies some of his more insane acts by saying, ""Common decency dictated the whole thing."" The film does not offer much hope for the humanity and may indeed make you sad when you consider that this is quite close to the way reality is. (Some will disagree, but they are probably deluded into thinking the world is basically a good place full of good people).",985564800,4,1924,4.886850152905199
1001088,3,6305240027,"In the Company of Men was, of course, Neil Labute's first film. Your Friends & Neighbors is his sophomore effort.
""Controversial,"" ensemble-cast, ""bunch-of-stories-interwoven together-style"" style independent films seem like quite the trend lately. Think Happiness. Think Magnolia. Think ... well, I know there are a few others I've run across in the last few years.
Your Friends & Neighbors is one of the better of its kind. I liked it. But, with the exception of Jason Patric's mesmerizing, 4+ minute monologue in the sauna, there is nothing here that's quite at the level of In the Company of Men. It is not as concise, not as coherent, and the performances aren't quite as good, although I wouldn't say they were necessarily bad. It was a treat to see Aaron Eckhart in a role so radically diametric to his part as Chad in In the Company of Men. Jason Patric takes over the role of the evil, yet commanding and charismatic misogynist in this one. Unfortunately, although he's admittedly one of the most enjoyable characters in the cast, he makes less sense than Chad did, and I'm not entirely sure what purpose he serves in the film overall. My impression this time around was more just that, well, Neil likes including this kind of character for his own sake. I prefer such decisions to be a little more integrated with the overall project, however.
Although Your Friends & Neighbors is a relatively entertaining collection of stark, sometimes amusing, sometimes arrestingly uncomfortable intertwined vignettes, peopled by once-removed characters who house some very, almost upsettingly common human qualities, it just doesn't quite have the overall punch of Labute's first movie. The mood is similar, and the themes are similar (although broader) -- but everything is a bit scattered and seems to have little point. Which I suppose is, in its way, the movie's intention -- but I admire the clean, deadly swordstroke of In the Company of Men to this decidedly meandering, uncertain hodgepodge. Whereas In the Company of Men was an artful and challenging piece of writing and cinema, Your Friends & Neighbors is merely an illustrative look at a handful of dopey commonfolk. And another self-confident bad guy for good measure.
Still, Your Friends & Neighbors doesn't come without Bob's recommendation. It's just a recommendation littered with a few reservations. While not as admirable on the whole as In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors does, admittedly, have a bit more replay value, as there's a little more going on overall. It's an interesting movie, just not a great one.",981763200,7,2592,5.016241299303944
1001129,5,6305240027,"I really think this movie is excellent.  Not many movies are so brutally honest and at the same time filled with the most dead-on humor.  Although  all the characters are well developed and the plot centers strongly around  the idea that everyone is some sort of victim, the real reason to watch  this movie is the powerful performance by Jason Patric.  Patric brilliantly  plays a mysogynist, a brutal sexual predator out for his own satisfaction.  I truly believe that this character is not only the best in the movie but  maybe one film's most interesting characters ever.  Anyway, he's also  really funny.  as is the movie.  i recommend it.",965865600,3,644,4.798165137614679

The story centers around six malcontents who interact, mainly, it  would seem, for nothing more than to fuel their own desolate existences.  The scenes are actually a series of conversations between various  combinations of the six people involved here:  Barry (Aaron Eckhart) is  married to Mary (Amy Brenneman); their marriage is neither happy nor  unhappy, apparently, but sexually unsatisfying to both.  Jerry (Ben  Stiller) lives with Terri (Catherine Keener), but the relationship seems to  be in limbo somewhere, and sexually dysfunctional.  Cary (Jason Patrick) is  a friend of Barry and Jerry, holds women, in general, in low esteem, is  probably a latent homosexual (he confides that the ""best he's ever had"" was  a locker room incident with a guy named Tim), and has an abusive nature (he  tells of appropriating some hospital stationary and sending a letter to a  woman who had dumped him, informing her that her name appears on the list  of former partners of a patient who has tested HIV positive).  Cheri  (Nastassja Kinski) is a lesbian who works in an art gallery, who eventually  forms an intimate relationship with Terri.  The conversations,  apparently meant to be ""frank"" and ""meaningful"" discussions of  dysfunctional relationships, sexual inadequacy, impotence, preferences and  ""best of"" revelations, comes across as just so much vapid, infantile  prattle.

LaBute just takes himself, and his material, too  seriously; his point of view is subjective, and the presentation is totally  devoid of humor and  nothing less than unimaginative.  And what he's done  with his actors is inexcusable; he's managed to strip them of their  personalities and the qualities that make them distinct, which is to say  that he's taken away from them the tools with which they ply their craft.  Despite what LaBute has done, there are still some decent  performances here (hence the two-star rating), Jason Patrick's being the  most notable; that he can come across so thoroughly repugnant is a credit  to his ability as an artist.  Keener, as well, does a good job, making  Terri, and her concerns, believable.  Amy Brenneman plays Mary with a  subtle introspection that works well for the character, and Ben Stiller is  solid, albeit unlikable, as Jerry.  The problem with ""Your Friends &  Neighbors"" is that, in the end, it all seems so meaningless; it's like  spending time with dull, witless, uninteresting people (and how cute, their  names all rhyme).  There's not a memorable scene (or anything you'd want to  remember) in the entire movie, and when it's over, you'll most likely find  yourself asking, What am I doing here?

Katherine Keener,  that sweetheart of independent movies is a real cold, abrupt person in this  and convincingly so.

1001136,1,6305240027,"It seems that some filmmakers these days do not hold the female viewer in mind at all when they create their ""art.""  What is troublesome about ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and other supposedly  ""cutting edge"" independent films (Kevin Smith's come to mind), is  that virulent misogyny is presented and not challenged by other characters  in the film.  It is almost as if these writer-directors want to make people  numb to it.  In ""Your Friends...,"" none of the subjects comes off  as having great moral character.  But is it pretty unfathomable that the  two conflicted, but basically average guys (""Barry"" and  ""Jerry,"" played by Aaron Eckhart and Ben Stiller, respectively)  would be friends with the creepy sociopath, ""Cary"" (Jason  Patric.)
Watching Cary's hot rage against women is really not a  revelation.  Does director, Neil Labute, think that it is a brave act to  put this kind of thing on screen?  Women already know this rage, and  putting it in a film without punishing it in any way gives a kind of  legitimacy.
I am wondering, those of you who liked this film so much and  gave it 5 stars, would you feel the same if it presented virulent racism as  merely  a personality quirk?  I doubt it.
Also, there are parts of the  film that do not make sense, even given that Cary has his hostile  perspective.  He levels a threatening, misogynist diatribe at Jerry's  bisexual girlfriend, ""Terri,"" (played by Catherine Keener) in a  bookstore where they meet by chance. Yet there is really no explanation for  this.  He barely knows her.  And he certainly does not seem to have much  affection for or loyalty to Jerry.  So why bother threatening this woman in  Jerry's defense?  I guess that Labute just wanted to drive a point home: if  you are a woman, do not dare transgress.  (Though the character, Terri, is  not really that transgressive or unfeminine.  Labute's criticism is very  weird and out of place in the late 90's.)
If you want to hear nasty,  woman-degrading epithets, like the ""b"" word and ""c""  word, used over and over again, then watch this. I felt like I needed a  bath after watching this, to wipe the crud off.

It is a monologue given in a steam room by the film's misogynist. What writing (by the film's director, Neil LaBute)! What a performance (by Jason  Patric)!
That Jason Patric is also the film's producer shows what  courage he has professionally and as a human being. This is the least  sympathetic film character (""Cary"") in a long time. Those who don't hate  ""Cary"" for his unbridled misogyny will despise him for the revelations of  his monologue.
The Amazon review apparently agrees: ""Then there's Jason  Patric (who also produced) as a calculating, misogynistic doctor who has  not had a peer on film or theater since David Mamet's Sexual Perversity in  Chicago (which took a different film form as About Last Night...).  Manipulative and forward, he's the white-hot core to LaBute's fire and has  the monologue of the year to boot.""
An amazing bit of trivia-not as  amazing as the monologue, but amazing nonetheless-is that Patric is the  grandson of Jackie Gleason of ""Honeymooners"" fame.
