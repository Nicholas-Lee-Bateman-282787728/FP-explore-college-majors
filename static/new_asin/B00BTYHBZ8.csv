8573770,2,B00BTYHBZ8,"The Tuxedo(2002) is a generic middle-of-the-road film starring Jackie Chan and Jennifer Love Hewitt. No wonder it was pushed back to September 2002. Chan probably learned how to make CGI while working on the film. Mr. Nice Guy(1998) was a middle-of-the-road Jackie Chan film, but at least it delivered on showmanship. The Tuxedo grows unwatchable during repeated viewings. Chan is a LOT older than his leading lady.  There's a cringe-inducing cameo by the late James Brown. The Tuxedo was trying to emulate Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2. Jason Isaacs plays a secret agent who gets hurt during an explosion. Chan takes his place and he's armed with a gadget-laden tuxedo. The villain wants to poison the world's fresh water supply. A young Jackie Chan was in the awful Not Scared to Die/Eagle Shadow Fist back in 1973! The Big Brawl and The Cannonball Run were failed attempts at pleasing English speaking audiences. Fearless Hyena(1979) was one of the better movies he made for Lo Wei.
Chan was also in The Spy Next Door(2010). We're supposed to laugh when George Lopez gets bitten by a snaping turtle! The Tuxedo is average.",1521417600,,1121,4.869109947643979

8573776,4,B00BTYHBZ8,"Off the top of my head I can't remember any other movie in which Jackie Chan's character actually doesn't know any martial arts. In THE TUXEDO, he plays Jimmy Tong, a New York cabbie who's crushing on the girl in the fashion store except Jimmy's got zero skills in how to sweet talk a dame. Off the top of my head I also can't remember another movie in which Jackie rocks a soul patch (or a Hooters shirt).

Jimmy gets an opportunity to pick up pointers when he becomes the chauffer to a suave, posh Englishman (Jason Isaacs). And there's even more to this Englishman, Clark Devlin, than a silky knack with the ladies. A bomb detonation renders Devlin comatose, and it's when Jimmy finds out that his boss is also a dashing international spy. Earlier, when Jimmy wondered about Devlin's oh-so-smooth ways, Devlin offers him this nugget: ""Trust me... 90% of it is clothes."" Clark Devlin had meant that literally.

Jimmy stumbles onto a multi-million-dollar tuxedo wired with experimental micro-circuitry that enables its wearer to perform dazzling feats. Jimmy dons the tuxedo (labeled as a ""Tactital Uniform Experiment"") and he suddenly metamorphoses into the world's most accomplished secret agent. The unfolding circumstances have Jimmy assuming Clark Devlin's identity, just in time for him to get drawn into a mogul mastermind's twisted plan to monopolize the water bottle industry by poisoning the global water supply.

Jimmy finds himself supervising a beautiful scientist-turned-rookie operative (Jennifer Love Hewitt), never mind that he doesn't know international espionage from jump. Both leads seem to enjoy each other's company. And, in fact, the immediate sense I got from watching Jackie interact with Hewitt is that he's half infatuated with her. Jennifer Love Hewitt, by the way, undertook three months of training to lend believability to her character. She pulls off her action scenes. As ""Delilah Blaine,"" Hewitt's natural bubbliness is tamped down, this characteristic only surfacing in the outtakes. In the outtakes, she can't stop cracking up, most of this good-naturedly at Jackie's expense.

Going by what's revealed in the Making Of the THE TUXEDO documentary in the DVD version, Jackie was nervous about the dance sequences and, in a role reversal, Jennifer Love Hewitt - who received great encouragement from Jackie during her fight scenes - was the one who sort of took Jackie under her wing for his dance routines. One showcase moment features Jackie attempting to perform James Brown's act during a gala function (Jackie had inadvertently knocked out James Brown just as the Godfather of Soul was about to go onstage). Luckily, the tuxedo has a ""Shake Booty"" option. Jimmy is introduced as the Last Emperor of Soul.

I think, 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. I'm giving THE TUXEDO higher marks than THE MEDALLION because his character here clearly doesn't have martial arts training, and it takes the hi-tech tuxedo to turn the simple cabbie into a formidable fighter. In THE MEDALLION the off-kilterness lies in Jackie's character already being this formidable kung-fu expert, so there's this redundancy in the magic medallion's elevating his martial arts skills to supernatural degrees because, even before the medallion, Jackie's character had already acquitted himself very well. Tuxedo-fu beats out medallion-fu, in terms of story context. THE TUXEDO may not have the intensity and energy and eye-popping real fighting found in Jackie's earlier Hong Kong thrillers, but it's pretty entertaining in its own right because Jackie and Jennifer are both extremely likable and they seem to be having fun. But you may have to excuse the vapid plot line.",1489276800,,3681,5.159128978224456
