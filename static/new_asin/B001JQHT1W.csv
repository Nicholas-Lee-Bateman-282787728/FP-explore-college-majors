8313463,5,B001JQHT1W,I grew up on these shows and so when I saw the set I bought it for my two little girls and they have sat and watched them for hours on end. They are not only entertaining but they have decent morals and teach good life lessons. The colors are beautiful as well as the costuming and it is not TOO scary for young children. I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone who has children they would like to share the classics with.,1290297600,2,450,4.067415730337078

It's a great compilation, but once again, for the great discount offered by Amazon for the entire set, I'd recommend purchasing the entire collection.",1247788800,5,899,4.869281045751634
8313466,4,B001JQHT1W,"Some of the greatest comedians and comic actors appeared during the run of Faerie Tale Theatre.  Collected here are four of the all-time best with the emphasis on comedy...

PINOCCHIO:
This is a wonderful adaptation of Carlo Collodi's timeless classic, about a wooden puppet who is brought to life thanks to a lonely man's desire to become a father.  Paul Reubens (aka Pee-Wee Herman) plays the title role with Carl Reiner as Geppetto, Pinocchio's loving father. Lainie Kazan is a sassy delight as Sophia, the Blue Fairy who grants the gift of life to Pinocchio, and James Coburn is fantastic as the evil Gypsy. Also in the cast are James Belushi and Michael Richards.

THE THREE LITTLE PIGS:
Larry (Billy Crystal) and his two brothers leave home to find their way in the world. Whilst his two brothers (Fred Willard and Stephen Furst) carelessly squander their savings and build flimsy houses of sticks and straw, Larry wisely builds his house of bricks...which proves to be an extremely wise move when a Wolf with an attitude problem (Jeff Goldblum) goes a-hunting for bacon...  Will Larry be able to stand up to the Wolf and win the affections of feisty piglette Tina (Valerie Perrine)? Wait and see!

THE TALE OF THE FROG PRINCE:
A spoilt, bratty Princess (Teri Garr) loses her beloved golden ball down a very deep well. Her only option of retrieving it is to accept the friendship of a 'repulsive' frog (Robin Williams). In exchange for a meal at the palace and a nights' sleep on her silken pillow, the frog retrieves the precious ball, but will the Princess uphold her part of the bargain?...

THE PRINCESS WHO HAD NEVER LAUGHED:
Princess Henrietta (Ellen Barkin) lives a life dominated by lessons, lessons and more lessons. Her only friends are her poe-faced father the King (Howard Hesseman), the tutor (Barrie Ingham) and governess (Mary Woronov). When her life becomes too much to bear she retreats to her room and won't come out unless someone makes her laugh.  Enter 'Weinerhead' Waldo (Howie Mandel), who's considered the most funny boy in the kingdom. Will he make Henrietta laugh, or perhaps even capture her heart?

Fun entertainment for the whole family!",1244937600,5,2172,4.880434782608695
