I took the chance and bought them anyway as a present for my boyfriend, we just tested them out yesterday and they worked perfectly fine on his Playstation 4.

6478521,5,B00LA1ZV7U,Excellent fun for the whole family!  We grew up with the muppets and are very happy our daughter is having the same opportunity.  The only shame is that we could not find a complete compendium of the Muppet movies.,1486252800,,214,4.461538461538462
6478522,1,B00LA1ZV7U,"These DVDs don't work with my dvd player. It said it was the wrong region to play them. These are for Europe or Canada and not for the US, I guess. So I had to convert them so i could get them to play.",1486166400,,201,3.590909090909091

6478524,5,B00LA1ZV7U,I could not be more pleased with my purchase. At such a low cost it was everything I could of dreamed of. The only problem I had was the Muppet disc weren't in order from old to new and Muppets most wanted was in its own little case and that was my least favorite movie. Others than that. I love it,1485648000,,298,3.901639344262295
6478525,4,B00LA1ZV7U,I live in the US and was able to play these in my Xbox one with no issue. Packaging was fine and all movies there. I will say that the picture is just a tad below what most quality blu-rays look like today but certainly better than DVD quality and this is well worth the $22 I paid. Very happy!,1484784000,2,294,3.9166666666666665

6478535,5,B00LA1ZV7U,"Bought this on impulse, then panicked a little when I saw some reviews saying it was the wrong region and wouldn't play in the US. I figured I'd just send it back if it didn't work because Amazon is awesome about returns. I'm happy to report I do not need to return it as it works perfectly in my PlayStation.

6478542,3,B00LA1ZV7U,"I bought this movie package because I wanted muppets most wanted, xmas carol, and treasure island, 3 fantastic movies in my opinion. I bought the blu-ray version, paying more, just for the extended version of muppets most wanted that released with the blu-ray, according to
online sources.

Even though this is a blu-ray, it does not have the extended version of muppets most wanted. I've seen it once extended, and it's a marginal improvement, I was looking forward to having that version. I watched several review videos of this product and read up on it, and no one mentioned that this set lacked that feature. It makes little sense to me that it would not have the extended version included, the movie has its own disk in the set, there is room for both theatrical and extended versions on the disk. I couldn't find info on the inclusion or exclusion of this feature before my purchase, despite searching.

I'm disappointed that I spent extra money on the blu-ray, just for this feature, and that online sources, including the amazon product description, did not include much information on the included features. Other than this, I love these movies, I just expected more to come with the blu-ray version... The superior graphics don't do all that much with a muppet movie, not enough for the extra cost.

Hopefully others benefit from this review.",1463788800,7,1353,4.848484848484849

6478546,5,B00LA1ZV7U,"Although far from comprehensive, this set includes all of the essential titles along with plenty of extras including the famous gag reels for several of them. Packaging is nothing special but for the price it shouldn't have to be. On a technical note: my PS3 is often a very fickle beast with blurays but hasn't had a single problem with any of these discs.",1456876800,2,357,4.59375
