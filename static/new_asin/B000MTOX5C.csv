8172199,5,B000MTOX5C,"This is an exellent, informative conversation between three terrific directors.  They clearly enjoy each other a great deal and are open, relaxed, funny and honest.  This should be required viewing for fans, but don't spend $25 on it this way.  It is available as a suppliment on New Line's exellent two-disc DVD release of Pan's Labyrinth, and if you're interested in this, you're going to want that as well since it is one of the films discussed.  You can get that DVD for equal or slightly less than the $24.99 price Amazon is selling this for alone, and you'll be getting a masterpiece of cinema if you go that route.",1179532800,3,621,4.618181818181818
8172200,5,B000MTOX5C,"If you've ever collaborated with someone on a book, film, screenplay, or song, you may have experienced a pureness of experience, an openness and honesty straight from the subconscious -- the delight in pure creativity. Whether you have or haven't, it's on full display as three brilliant directors reveal their friendship and collaborations. I happen to think that Del Toro may be our greatest living filmmaker, but Inarrutu and Cuaron are brilliant in their own right. Charlie Rose asks just the right questions to have them open up and reveal wonderful insights into the chemistry behind their art.",1172966400,,601,5.142857142857143
