3648556,5,B00009AVAA,Sniper One is a fantastic movie which accurately depicts the life of a sniper in South America.  Billy Zane does an excellent job of playing a government desk employee.  Sniper Two has much more action and a new twist around every turn.  Tom Berenger does a tip-top job. He is cinema gold in this amazing movie.  Sniper 1 and 2 are my favorite movies of all time.  A must see for everyone!,1083628800,11,389,4.347222222222222

3648583,5,B00009AVAA,I like the movie.  Disk 1 won't play but I never contacted the seller on the issue.  I did not pay a lot for both so I did not see the need to complain.  Disk 2 was good,1398211200,2,169,3.3947368421052633
3648584,5,B00009AVAA,"An adrenaline-pumping,invigorating...action film. One shot. One kill. No exceptions. By that hard and fast rule,legendary Marine sniper (Tom Berenger) serves his lonely duty. With 74 confirmed kills, he may be ready for his final assignment. But is he ready for his toughest? The Pentagon has chosen GS-9 Richard Miller (Billy Zane), a silver-medal marksman aiming for a Washington promotion. Together the bush-savvy gunner and the inexperienced bureaucrat must track down and eliminate a powerful rebel leader and his Colombian druglord financier. It's a suicide mission into the jungles of Central America, where a man carries his life in his hands - and lives it one bullet at a time.",1364860800,3,687,5.3119266055045875
3648585,5,B00009AVAA,"These are both fictiousional stories based on the exploits of GySgt Carlos Hathcock USMC. The storylines were updated to fit the current times when the movie were released. I guess the actually Vietnam War exploits were not in Hollywoods political acceptance or GySgt Carlos Hathcock did not give them permission to re-enact a book he helped write about (Marine Sniper, 93 confirmed kills) himself & the Marine Sniper units & programs during the Vietnam War.",1355011200,,458,5.12
