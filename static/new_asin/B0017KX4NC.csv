3173181,2,B0017KX4NC,"i have read ""eyewitness"" accounts of praetorian guards flinging torches through roman windows; another quotes the reasons cited by a rebelling legionnaire as the execution of his mother (his deadly predecessor), and the burning of rome.  this cinema vignette does detail the palace he built, including an explanation of it's subsequent immersion.  even so, it strains to sanitize him, beginning with a simple assertion that his behavior, apart from occasional executions of (other) rivals, never included any significant trespass upon taboos.  this is reminiscent of charles elliot's disfigurement of harvards first ""great books"" set, in which catamites are transformed into,""little fishes"", etc.  architecturally enlightening, and historically dubious.",1483574400,,753,6.009345794392523
3173182,2,B0017KX4NC,"The reconstructions of Nero's Golden House were crude and unrealistic. For example, they were too lazy or lacked the skill to recreate the capitals and bases of the columns so they made simplified substitutions that looked really bad. Then they copied them over and over again in endless repetition in long colonnades which they showed over and over again in the show. The recreation of the interiors were lame and inaccurate, too. When were these done?  In the early 1990's? Nothing this bad is being made these days. They didn't show some of the great discoveries in the palace including the huge golden mosaic of wine making.  I am giving it two stars for the narration by Samuel West and the commentary by the two specialists they interviewed. Wallace Hadrill-Smith was pretty good, but he didn't have much to say.",1483488000,,818,4.835714285714285

3173246,4,B0017KX4NC,"Despite the ""vintage"" appearance of the cover art thumbnail, this is a relatively modern production.  It is full of seemingly deliberate anachronistic shots of Las Vegas and outtakes from cheesy old Hollywood movies.  But rather than ""dumbing down"" the production, those were included to make a point.  I had never really considered the over-the-top gaudiness of Vegas as analogous to ancient Rome, but when one is discussing the Golden House of Nero, I suppose it is actually a rather apt comparison.  This documentary ""works"", and I enjoyed it.  It would be wonderful to visit the actual site.

3173252,4,B0017KX4NC,"Our view of Nero as a dissolute and depraved emperor was distorted so much by his successors, as is revealed in this documentary.  The discovery of his Golden House paints a different picture of the actual historical person.  What an amazing feat of architecture, art and engineering from such an ancient time.  I found this very educational, although some of the modern kitsch used to illustrate it was unnecessary.  It is wonderful that this has been unearthed (literally) and opened to the public.

3173254,4,B0017KX4NC,"This was a fun documentary about Nero's Golden House. I loved the photography from inside the little remaining portion, as well as the dome that was once likely a grand dining room.

It was nice to see the other aspects of Nero discussed, and not the 'bad press' the winners of the political games of the time gave us. However, no matter how you look at it, his is a sad fate, as well as a sad life. From dealing with his mother, then the measures he took to keep his position, right to his death at a relatively young age.

The documentary inspired me to look up additional information about him, so I would say it did its job in making me think. :)",1377820800,,650,4.192

The discussion of archeology, architecture, engineering, and design with regard to the history thereof is first rate.  I do take exception, along with another earlier reviewer, of the use of modern images overplayed and put into this video so out of context in place and time.  Modern connections have their place, but not as unpredictable piecemeal splatterings into the story.",1375142400,,522,5.046511627906977

3407679,2,B0017KX4NC,"The reconstructions of Nero's Golden House were crude and unrealistic. For example, they were too lazy or lacked the skill to recreate the capitals and bases of the columns so they made simplified substitutions that looked really bad. Then they copied them over and over again in endless repetition in long colonnades which they showed over and over again in the show. The recreation of the interiors were lame and inaccurate, too. When were these done?  In the early 1990's? Nothing this bad is being made these days. They didn't show some of the great discoveries in the palace including the huge golden mosaic of wine making.  I am giving it two stars for the narration by Samuel West and the commentary by the two specialists they interviewed.

It is full of seemingly deliberate anachronistic shots of Las Vegas and outtakes from cheesy old Hollywood movies.  But rather than ""dumbing down"" the production, those were included to make a point.  I had never really considered the over-the-top gaudiness of Vegas as analogous to ancient Rome, but when one is discussing the Golden House of Nero, I suppose it is actually a rather apt comparison.

The discovery of his Golden House paints a different picture of the actual historical person.  What an amazing feat of architecture, art and engineering from such an ancient time.  I found this very educational, although some of the modern kitsch used to illustrate it was unnecessary.  It is wonderful that this has been unearthed (literally) and opened to the public.

It was nice to see the other aspects of Nero discussed, and not the 'bad press' the winners of the political games of the time gave us. However, no matter how you look at it, his is a sad fate, as well as a sad life. From dealing with his mother, then the measures he took to keep his position, right to his death at a relatively young age.

The documentary inspired me to look up additional information about him, so I would say it did its job in making me think. :)",1377820800,,650,4.192

8266299,4,B0017KX4NC,Neros Golden House is wonderful. Keep in mind that the Romans hated Nero and his lavish palace and destroyed and then covered over his palace.
