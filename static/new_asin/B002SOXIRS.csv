It's a popular scenario in pulps of the time, and these movies may have inspired the makers of Re-animator. In -A Head For The Devil-Dr Ood not only keeps a head alive of a co-scientist, he puts a dancers body on the head,or is it, puts his girls head on a dancers body, without her knowledge. The girlfriend just thinks Dr Ood is an incredible surgeon who has worked wonders,but she slowly learns the dark truth. Yhe Brain That Couldn't Die- I've always enjoyed this movie. Jan becomes Jan in the Pan when her living head is kept that way by her genius husband to be. Ah, but there is an even darker evil experiment kept locked away in the closet. Will Jan get her revenge against her evil fiance by using telepathy?
Then there's the short film Experiments on the Revival of Organisms, in which Russian scientists cut off a dogs head, and keep it alive! I think it's the real deal! Amazing!",1255737600,,1040,4.478947368421053
