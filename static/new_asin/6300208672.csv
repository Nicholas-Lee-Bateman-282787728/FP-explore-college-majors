223498,3,6300208672,"I loved this movie when I was a kid, it came on AMC fairly often. I suppose I enjoyed the movie because of Harpo, his antics, and Chico with his musical prowess. It certainly wasn't for the singing and the dancing, which there was way too much of. After finding out the miserable circumstances in making the movie, I think it's unfortuate how things turned out. After viewing the movie when I was older, I didn't see as much of the appeal that I did when I was young. Harpo is eternally funny and endearing of course, there's no denying. I suppose that the guys were just burnt out on doing the brother routine, and wanted to move on. The only reason that Groucho appears at all is because, when filming, the producers ran out of money. The financial backers promised to help, only if Groucho was in it. Plus, the scene towards the end with all of the advertisements was put in, in an effort to raise money to continue filming. All in all, the movie was a big disaster, and it would be the last true project the brothers would work on together.
  Besides Harpo, the most memorable scene was with Marilyn Monroe:
 MM: Mr. Grunion, some men are following me!
 Groucho (raising eyebrows): I can't imagine why...
  It's unfortunate that the brothers made their exit from Hollywood as a team, under such poor circumstances. They deserved better.",1007683200,3,1340,4.5625
223499,1,6300208672,"I am a huge fan of the Marx brothers. I own all of their movies except ""Love Happy"" and ""At the Circus"". They both stink. It's not the acting, it's the writing. The story is really terrible, and the Marx brothers  don't have the same energy they used to. They are in their late 50's to early 60's. It's really sad to see how MGM ruined them. I couldn't even finish Love Happy. Rent it before you buy it.",1007164800,2,403,4.10126582278481
223500,4,6300208672,"I saw this as a kid and loved it, primarily because of Harpo's antics. Particularly the scenes where he makes the sad heroine laugh by performing bizzare tricks (years later, I would try this on winning girls myself). The scene where he goes on a wild ride on the city's electric billboards is also a high point, and there is some poignancy in the finale where he walks off twirling the bejeweled necklace in the night, knowing this is the last time we'll see him on film. Granted, seeing this as an adult will not impress you that much, but if there's some kid in you, enjoy Harpo's antics and have a ball!",1002067200,2,607,4.380530973451328
223501,3,6300208672,"By 1950, the Marx Brothers were too old and tired.  By this time, their bits were stale.  Groucho only makes ""cameo"" appearances at the beginning and the end of the movie.  Harpo and Chico are not all that funny.  This film primarily showcased a young Marilyn Monroe to the world.  Other than that, this film has nothing going for it.  But, as one reviewer said; old, tired Marx Brothers are better than no Marx Brothers at all.  So, I gave this film three stars for Groucho, Harpo, and Chico.  Harpo and Chico will go on tour to showcase their musical talents.  Groucho will eventually become the host of a very popular quiz game and will also be the guest host of the Tonight Show.  As a matter of fact, Groucho introduced Johnny Carson as the ""new host"" of the Tonight Show.  Although this film was a failure, the Brothers were still talented and entertaining in their own right.",994550400,2,882,4.518987341772152
223502,5,6300208672,"...The Marx Brothers left us one more amusement in the form of movie for the final time. For the first time, on the other hand, Harpo Marx headed the characters' and story credit. In this respect, many fans and critics see ""Love Happy"" as a Harpo's solo vehicle. Still, I believe that there are quite a few great moments for the other Brothers, Chico and Groucho (*saluting Chico, the eldest sibling!).
Chico first appears with his usual warm smile attempting to get a job from Mike Johnson (Paul Valentine) at a financially struggling theater company. He makes it, after all, after showing a trace of his frindly and mild stupidity. Grouncho, on the other hand, opens the door of the film appearing as a private eye agent named Sam Grunion. In his all-time rapid-fire talks, we find many clever and funny wisecracks every time he opened the mouth to talk.
In addition to its unique ""sentimental"" atomosphere, the greatest and most brilliant moments of the entire film should be definitely when the Brothers present musical numbers respectively (*the exception is Groucho, who unfortunately did NOT sing any songs this time!). In the chronological order, Chico performed ""Gypsy Love Song"" on the piano and ""shot"" the keys as usual. In this number, Chico features Mr. Lyons (Leon Belasco) on violin, or more correctly, trying to stop him to take away every stage property belonging to him as a result of the company's bankrupcy.
Now hearing Harpo play the solo harp is the biggest excitement on this fim, I believe. We may realize it has been many years since ""Horse Feathers"" or ""Duck Soup"" when we see him in a close-up shot, but his performing ""Swanee River"" proves that Harpo is timelessly great!
Along with a rare brief appearance of young Marilyn Monroe, I think that ""Love Happy"" should be recognized the ""last but not least"" film of the Marx Brothers.",976406400,10,1858,4.827586206896552
223503,3,6300208672,"This modest little movie gets disparaged as a tepid finale to the Marx Brothers film career.  It's obvious from the start that the inspired lunacy of ""A Night at the Opera"" or the best of the early Paramount  films is missing, but even Marx Brothers ""lite"" will suffice for  off-the-wall comedy fans.  Many of the familiar Marx elements are present.  Harpo, for example, frantically whistles, pantomimes, and charades as he  tries to deliver urgent news to a bewildered Chico.  In fact, this is  amusingly done twice; the first time Harpo ""phones"" it in, trying  to get Chico to read his mind!  Harpo has been described as an enchanted  elf, and his otherworldly qualities are displayed in his foraging talents  used to feed the troupe of hungry actors, and the marvelous way he blends  right in with the electric signs during the movie's climactic roof-top  chase.  Groucho's role is smaller than usual, but he has more than just a  few unrelated scenes, as has been reported elsewhere.  Marilyn Monroe does  her breathless walk-on and Groucho leeringly puts an hilarious exclamation  point to her very brief appearance.  Harpo plays the harp, Chico plays the  piano, and Groucho smokes his cigar and wiggles his eyebrows; all in true  Marx Brothers fashion.  The one Marx Brothers element that is conspicuous  by its absence is a typical Groucho-Chico exchange in classic ""Why A  Duck"" tradition. There is a weak effort to introduce a musical comedy  plot with its obligatory singing, dancing, and romantic complications.  Use  the fast-forward control to get back to Harpo and the guys.
Granted, this  film isn't the greatest Marx Brothers comedy, but dismissing the entire  movie is a mistake.  Good second string stuff.",952905600,35,1724,5.00709219858156
223504,5,6300208672,"Love Happy is great!  Because Harpo wrote it, this movie is very different from the rest of the Marx Bros. movies.  It of course has much more silent parts for Harpo, and he is the main character.  Also, the abscence of  Groucho from a main role in the play, is strikingly different.  Here is a  basic overview of Love Happy:  The main characters: Harpo Marx as  Harpo; Chico Marx as Faustino; Groucho Marx as Sam Grunion; Ilona Massey as  Madame Egilitchi; and Vera-Ellen as Maggie Phillips.  Groucho is the  narrator, as well as a detective who is trying to solve the mystery of a  missing necklace valued at $1,ooo,ooo.  However, Madame Egilitchi and her  two bodyguards also have their sights set on the necklace.  Meanwhile, a  group of struggling young actors are trying to put on a play called Love  Happy, and Harpo is stealing food for the actors (""The actors were  underfinanced and undernourished"" in the words of Groucho).  However,  in a can of sardines Harpo steals is this very necklace that everybody is  searching for.  Harpo walks away with the necklace, not knowing it's value.  It finally passes through the hands of Maggie Phillips, and onto the piano  which Chico is playing on on the opening night of the play.  Chico  discovers this and runs off with the diamonds, giving a fake copy to Harpo.  But somehow, Harpo gets the real ones!  This of course leads to a madcap  finish, as everybody chases Harpo through the Windsor theatre on opening  night.  The movie ends with Madame Egilitchi denied the jewels to Harpo,  and Groucho the wife of Madame Egilitchi.  This is a great movie, and I  HIGHLY  recommend it.",917827200,11,1635,4.697508896797153
223609,3,6300208672,A final film for the brothers but it stayed true to their sense of humor. Harpo had the majority role in this one whereas Groucho commanded the earlier films.

223768,5,6300208672,"While this film was never to be billed as a ""Marx Bros"" film, it still ended up being a must watch classic for Marx fans. This was suppose to be Harpo's solo film without his brothers. But as brother Chico was having some financial difficulties, he later asked if it would be ok to add a part for himself. Harpo agreed, and was happy to have him. But after doing so, the studio would not make the film unless Groucho was added to the cast. They wanted to be able to profit from the ""Marx Bros"" billing. In fact Groucho disliked the film so much, he did not recognize it as his official final film with his brothers. Though Grouchos part in the film isn't large, he still has some fantastic one liners! If you are wanting to see this as Marilyn Monroes first film roll, well you better pay attention as she is in the film for all of about a minute. Of course there is some beautiful and quite sweet scenes of Harpo on the harp! You will get a chance to see some typical awesome Chico Marx piano playing scenes as well!

The musical numbers with Harpo and Chico are great and the scene where Vera Allen puts ""the whammy"" on Harpo is hilarious. Also fun cameos by Raymond Burr and a very young Marilyn Monroe.

223773,3,6300208672,"I just bought this at a discount (from a Silicon Valley all-in-one electronics outlet famous for starting out as a grocery store) and I was looking forward to seeing some of the zany antics that I'd come to expect from the Marx Brothers.

Instead of another classic performance, we're blessed with a mature band of three brothers who have aged (somewhat gracefully) into their roles but are now just stepping through them for the most part - except for Harpo, who has the most vigorous chase scene since running around in, ""The Big Store"".

Groucho is now sporting a real mustache and the glasses look real as well and the lines around Chico's eyes and face are getting even deeper.  Harpo still has his comic charm but age is after him as well, although I remember him doing a cameo on, ""The Lucy Show"" that was absolutely brilliant, if not that strenuous. Considering that Harpo had a clip in a 1925 silent film, its quite remarkable.

As for the movie plot, it is pretty basic: stunted stage production runs out of money, lead male and female characters are ""sort of"" in love, stolen diamonds are involved as a sub-plot (Raymond Burr as a minion!), etc.

What was really disappointing was that Groucho was relegated to the role of a ""narrator,"" yet still had a few scenes in the film proper (but with none of the charm or wittiness that his work with Margaret Dumont used to unleash).

As always, there is the anticipation that we'll be rewarded with Chico at the keyboard and we're not disappointed here. He even works up a delightful duet with a violinist who appears familiar but I don't remember his name.  Unfortunately, what could have been a serious mood-setting opportunity (when the production is shutting down for lack of funds) appears to be cut short and Chico hits just a few notes before the camera cuts to another scene.  Watching him in action, one has to wonder at his versatility - just as Jack Benny played the violin for laughs, he was also a respected artist and I don't know of any recorded work that Chico produced that was just for pure musical enjoyment.

Harpo was also allowed one of his classic sequences where he brings out a harp to play happy birthday for an unhappy dancer, and then it neatly segued into the beautiful harp solo that we've come to expect from him.  Also still, we see the absolute serious concentration he applies to his craft compared to the comedic artistry that Chico portrays with his piano work - similar to that displayed by Victor Borge.  Between the two of them, Harpo or Chico, Chico rewards us with bright and cheerful tunes and entertainment while Harpo brings the heart and soul of the instrument to bear and gifts us with its beauty.

The one real treat I was looking forward to - and some box covers had prominent photographs of her - was Marylin Monroe in her first screen exposure (ie, Introducing Marylin Monroe).  I waited and waited and waited and finally, one hour and eight minutes into the movie, she arrived on screen in a scene with Groucho which lasted all of 8 (that's EIGHT) SECONDS!

Despite that short exposure, she showed the beginnings of the screen presence that she became known for (not necessarily her comedic, as they portrayed her in ""vamp mode"") and it was an interesting, if brief element of her future in film.

If nothing else, it is worth adding it to your movie library but don't be expecting the story to wrap up before the final credits - it ended very lamely.",1430092800,3,3457,4.607491856677524

223823,4,6300208672,"if anyone can take an unremarkable swansong and keep it from being altogether dreary, it's Groucho, Harpo, and Chico.
the film is most frequently cited as the first screen appearance of Marilyn Monroe, and the usual implication is that it's otherwise worthless. that's admittedly the most significant factor, but just because it's not Duck Soup doesn't make it completely worthless. it turns out to be just solid enough for The Marx Brothers - for my money the all-time champions of cinematic comedy - to work a bit of graceful (if now geriatric) magic.
it all began with a story by Harpo, and i have to admit  that maybe it should've remained the solo vehicle he'd conceived it as. you can tell that the other two were brought in pretty much as an afterthought. by most accounts Chico was as much a conartist as his character (with the faux-Italian accent being the only significant difference), and he used his prowess to fast-talk his way into the film. whereupon investors decided they wanted a complete set, so room had to be made for Groucho as well.
fortunately, the abilities of the Brothers are such that they could be worked reasonably satisfactorily into the mix. Groucho narrates the film in the role of a satirical private detective, and the role so aptly fits his gifts that it's easy to forget how peripheral he really is. Chico didn't get woven in quite so seamlessly and his presence isn't always so easy to justify, but at least his character, a would-be mentalist, is one whose presence in this setting sort of makes sense.
specifically, the setting is a struggling theatre troupe trying to get their own musical revue, Love Happy, off the ground. Harpo is their ""gofer,"" and circumstances are such as to not always afford him the luxury of ethics. by typical Harpo logic, the performers need to eat more that anyone who can actually afford groceries does. the only problem with that is that the market he scavenges is in fact a ""front"" for international jewel smugglers. when the priceless Romanoff diamonds end up in Harpo's hands (karma, maybe?), his difficulties escalate. so no, it's nothing we movie enthusiasts hadn't seen before.
whatever else you wanna say about the film, it does play to Harpo's strengths. yes, he does play his usual mischievous but compassionate unearthly urchin, but damn it, we love that character. he has true chemistry with his charming leading lady, one Vera-Ellen, and proves a formidable foil for our villainess, one Ilona Massey. his staunch resiliency in the face of her thugs, Bruce Gordon and Raymond Burr, showcases a formidable talent that hasn't quite dried up yet. and we get one of my very favorite Marx routines: Chico's uptake slows visibly as Harpo, via frenetic pantomime, attempts to give him an urgent warning.
so you can expected the expected here, but it's the expected you loved the first time, from past masters of their craft. Chico seems to be slowing down, effectively passing his prime on camera, but his little brothers have still got it. it was around the same time, after all, that Groucho undertook a second stardom with his quiz show You Bet Your Life.
so to summarize, it may not quite measure up to A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races, but it manages to be as much good fun as, say, Go West or A Night In Casablanca.
interestingly, a few years later no less an auteur than Billy ""Some Like It Hot"" Wilder had a revelation: there had come to be a new paragon of the sort of staunch pomposity at which the Marxism of old was always aimed, and so conceived a comic extravaganza to be called A Day At The U.N. there was great enthusiasm on the part of the would-be stars, particularly Groucho, but alas, the admittedly intriguing prospect wasn't meant to be. insurance companies, already leery of their advanced ages, officially balked when Chico was taken with a sudden, debilitating illness. (which, depending on who's tell the story, may or may not of killed him even as negotiations were taking place.)
it's interesting as well as a little scary to think that not so long before they'd had just enough agility left to make Love Happy amusing, if nothing more substantial.",1411776000,3,4164,4.751381215469613

Look for a very small role played by a Marilyn Monroe before she went platinum blonde. The Marx Brothers are amusing as usual. Groucho has the best lines. Harpo, of course, plays his big harp as usual and Chico gets to be the charlatan and then the hero of the play that happens amidst a search by Madame Egilechi for valuable diamonds. Raymond Burr, who would later go on to play the lead role in ""Perry Mason"", plays one of the thugs of madame, who gets to strike a pose early on in an attempt to seduce Harpo. The film was made to pay off the gambling debts of Chico Marx and perhaps as a way to increase Harpo Marx's stardom. The film ran out of money at the end so they had it up on the rooftops around advertising billboards. This is considered one of the worst Marx Brother films ever (Groucho agreed) and yet it's still in ""B-ish"" grade range on my scale. As some people have said today the Marx Brothers were ahead of their time and it shows. This would be the last movie they did together.

I understand that this was not their best movie that they made, it was entertaining and funny! Even though Marilyn Monroe had a very brief part, it was enjoyable to see her so young in this movie. It is not hard to believe why men would be fallowing Marilyn Monroe anywhere and I am sure she had that problem in her personal life too! This is the only time you will see Marilyn Monroe in this movie. It was funny! If your a Marx brothers fan or a Marilyn Monroe fan, with out this movie your collection will not be complete! The Marx Brothers had me laughing and I especially like the part where Harpo pretends to remove his eyes and juggle them and put them back in his head crooked! I found the beginning of the movie very entertaining, when he tries to get away from the police man and him stealing all the stuff in the store. The chase scene at the end of the movie was funny too, it kinda reminded me of a chase scene of a Scooby Doo Cartoon! I found this movie a joy to watch and it was very entertaining!

The Marx Brothers, Marilyn Monroe, ""Love Happy""
With Vera-Ellen, Raymond Burr, Eric Blore, Screen Play by Frank Tashlin and Mac Benoff, Produced by Lester Cowan, Directed by David Miller, Musical Score and Lyrics by Ann Ronnell

Harpo is a true patron of the arts, taking from the rich to help feed a group of poor actors who are struggling to open a new musical without financial backers. When he steals a tin of sardines from a classy Fifth Avenue market (hot delicacies in the front-hot diamonds in the back!), he unknowingly makes off with the missing Romanoff diamonds, smuggled into the country by a sinful yet scintillating jewel theif. She traces the tin back to the theater where she backs the show, hoping to recover the diamonds...and nearly brings the house down in a madcap race to retrieve the jewwls on opening night!

223910,3,6300208672,"Love Happy is one hour and thirty one minutes and was released in theaters on March 3, 1950. If you don't count the Story of Mankind then this is the official last Marx Brothers movie. The movie itself was never supposed to be a Marx Brothers movie. Harpo wrote the movie as a sole project for himself, but nobody would back the movie unless the other two brothers were in the movie as well. So Harpo had to rewrite the movie to include his brothers and it shows in the movie. Only in two scenes are Chico and Harpo are shown together and in one scene Harpo and Groucho are shown together. Nowhere in the movie are the three Marx Brothers shown together. Groucho is the narrator and Detective Sam Grunion in the movie and plays more or less a supporting role. Also this is the only Marx Brothers film where Groucho does not have his famous greased painted moustache and thick eyebrows. He sports a real moustache in this film.

Love Happy opens with Detective Sam Grunion telling about one of his famous cases the Romanoff diamonds and there the movie starts. Basically Harpo, while gathering food for the cast of the Broadway show Love Happy, accidently steals the sardine can with the Romanoff diamonds. During the rest of the movie Madame Egelichi, played by Ilona Massey, and her thugs try in vain to get the diamonds back. That is basically the movie in a nutshell. Chico plays the piano, Harpo plays the harp, but there is no song to be sung from Groucho in this movie which is a rarity. All though he has no speaking part the movie stars Raymond Burr of Perry Mason and Ironside fame. Some trivia about this movie includes and line where Chico says ""Tootsie frootsie ice cream"". That line is from the film A Day at the Races. A grunion is a fish and in the DVD version there is an extra six minutes of footage that is not shown in the VHS version. Love Happy does not live up to past Marx Brothers movie and should have remained a solo project for Harpo. Love Happy gets a C-.

223911,1,6300208672,"If I was reviewing the movie (I do not feel this is the place for that), I would have given it three stars (I enjoyed it but it wasn't one of the Marx Brothers' best). However, this review is about the DVD itself. The packaging itself is cheap looking with no literature inside. The case jacket claims, under a Special Features heading, to have been Digitally Mastered, which, at first glance, suggests it was digitally restored or remastered. Actually, it's just marketing spin. Although video quality was good, it was not restored or remastered. It was just digitized, which is the only way it could have been put on a DVD (and what's so special about that?).

Also listed under Special Features was full screen version (which isn't wide screen but neither was the original movie so what's special about that?), Dolby Monaural Audio (that's special?), Interactive Menus (two selections: Play and Scene Selection), and Scene Index (double talk here, it's already included under ""Interactive Menus"" and practically all DVDs have them anyway so what's so special about that?).

Despite the claims on the case jacket, there are no special features. All one gets is the movie. Audio and video is ok. At least I didn't notice any splices or scratches in the film. At $14.98, it was definitely overpriced for what one gets. I've gotten far better from the $3.98 bargain bins.",1320796800,2,1370,4.875536480686695
223912,3,6300208672,"I bought this movie mainly for Vera-Ellen's dancing.  Her tap routine during the opening credits is the highlight of the film, although the other numbers are good too.  Marilyn Monroe makes a cameo appearance.  As for the Marx Brothers, they are amusing in places, although I always liked Groucho best in YOU BET YOUR LIFE.",1311724800,,323,4.836363636363636
223913,4,6300208672,"This film is not as well known as many others but has some of the usual antics and includes the surprise of seeing both Marilyn Monroe and Raymond Burr in early roles on screen.  As usual Harpo steals the show with his antics and music.

I love that little Harpo penguin!

Marilyn is stunning!",1301616000,2,293,4.388888888888889
223914,5,6300208672,"Many reviewers have said that Love Happy is worth viewing, especially for Marx Brothers fans, but it is not among their best. I disagree that it is not among their best.  This is THE most delightful Marx Brothers movie, and has become my favorite. There's a cuteness and lovability to this movie that is more pronounced than their other films.

Here's why I think it is a cut above the others: First, it has a more developed plot than most of their movies.  Most of their other movies are driven predominantly by their non-stop slapstick comedy.  Here we get the slapstick comedy along with an interesting plot and story line that actually has some intrigue and suspense mixed in with the madcap humor.  Second, While all 3 Marx Brothers are in this movie, Groucho's role is predominantly as the narrator of the story. Therefore, the features of Groucho's humor that sometimes border on annoying, such as his constant personal insults to the other characters, the pandemonium which is fun but sometimes goes over the top, and the subversive edge to his humor are missing from this film.  But don't get the wrong impression.  This film has lots of action, and the slapstick comedy is at its best. Third, Harpo wrote the story, and it is filled with his sight gags, which are amazing, ingenious and cute.  Harpo's dominant role in this movie also imparts his gentle nature to it.  Fourth, the supporting cast is the best ever.  Vera-Ellen, who many believe is the best of the Hollywood movie musical dancers, has a substantial role.  She adds a level of beauty, grace and charm to this movie that is in lesser supply in the other Marx Brother's movies. Marilyn Monroe makes a brief cameo appearance in one of her earliest movie roles. Other accomplished actors include Raymond Burr (Perry Mason, Ironside) as one of the villains, and the British comedy actor, Eric Blore, in a small role. Fifth, there is some good dancing and music here, including the theme song, ""Willow Weep for Me"", which was later made into a big pop hit in the 1960's by British singing duo, Chad & Jeremy. And Harpo displays his amazing musical skills in a couple of harp solos, and Chico does and amazing piano duo with violin accompaniment.

The DVD I viewed is the one put out by Lion's Gate.  It is digitally mastered, and has excellent sound and picture quality.

So all in all, I find no weaknesses here, and give Love Happy a solid 5 Stars.  Don't miss this one!",1295222400,3,2441,4.6573426573426575
223955,4,6300208672,"This movie has the distinction of being considered the worst Marx Brothers movie, and it's really about five movies removd from the worst: it's the best Marx since the 1937 A Day at The Races, with a few spins and turns to make that statement work.
Well photographed in black and white, with a nice soundtrack, the picture has a pleasant, easy-going aura about it - good close-ups of the brothers, who do their thing more often than you might expect in the proverbial ""swan song"".

Harpo works as a caterer of sorts for a theatre company - he ""appropriates"" lunches from well to do patrons of a local, upscale deli...actually a jewelry laundering business....no spoiler here!

Chico is an out of work...Chico...he insinuates himself into the company, as a self-appointed liason with the reluctant backer.

Chico plays alot of piano, and the scene with the company benefactor/violinist is a pearl. Chico manages to *buy* time for the failing production by engaging the talents of the guy. (Some of the dialogue was used about ten years later in a British TV appearance with Chico and another musician).

Groucho, Sam Grunion, is the most layed back Detective in history. He starts off well enough, but his narrative isn't very funny, and when he actually arrives on the scene, either to locate the diva-esque Ilona Massey , or her elusive jewelry, there's little to smile at, other than his graceful, loping gait on the rooftop to which that Harpo has led the bad guys.

The much-discussed Marilyn Monroe appearance is nice, but the scene is less than one minute, it's late in the picture, very poorly directed and written. We all know she says, ""A couple of men are following me"", to which Groucho responds, ""I wonder why"". In an imagined remake, Grunion looks into the camera, wags his eyebrows, and says, ""I'm only aware of one"".

Vera-Ellen is the Busby-Berkeley type girlfriend of the male star of ""Love Happy"", the musical within the story - and she does well in a sensual dance number and in a terrific poignant scene at Harpo's ""home"", a hideout at the park.

Future TV characters ""Perry Mason"" and ""Frank Nitty"" are seen in early appearancs; Frank Gargan, who played Oliver Hardy's nemesis in ""The Bullfighters"", plays a middle aged Cop out to arrest...anyone. He just can't seem to get his man - the elusive Harpo.

Very bad plot resolution but at that point the viewer has already said, as one Amazon reviewer did: well, it's no Duck Soup...but not many movies are.

223956,3,6300208672,"This is a good collector movie as it is the last movie that the Marx Brothers made together.  Secondly, it is neat to see Marilyn Monroe in a brief bit part as this was the beginning of her career.  The movie has some of the Harpo, Chico, and Groucho slapstic and music.  However, it doesn't appear to be written as well as some of their earlier movies.",1265500800,,353,4.2388059701492535
223957,4,6300208672,"Most Marx Bros. fans think of ""Night in Casablanca"" as the swansong for the boys. And while it is the last ""real Marx Brothers"" movie, I prefer ""Love Happy"". The film has the most surreal and magical visual/physical humor of the later Marx movies since its mainly Harpo's project. And while there is little of the brothers actually sharing the screen, I think they were happier to appear as independent characters as their chemistry in ""Casablanca"" seemed phoned-in and possibly resentful. Also, the film's plot is tight, entertaining and moves at a brisk pace unlike some other later Marx Bros films.

Better than ""Room Service"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Circus"" IMO. But not better than ""Go West"" with its amazing Buster Keaton-written climax and classic quotables like ""Time wounds all heels"".

Should be owned.",1259798400,,807,5.106060606060606
223958,3,6300208672,"LOVE HAPPY is the Marx Brothers' final starring feature film, though the spotlight here is on Harpo (the real star of the picture), while Chico and especially Groucho have supporting roles. This one is primarily for Marx completists, who will be delighted to learn that the print used for this DVD transfer runs 91 minutes rather than the standard 85-minute version previously released on VHS ... and seen on TV and in theatrical revivals. I'm not sure where this longer cut has been languishing all these years (the DVD is a Republic Pictures/Lions Gate release, yet there's a Paramount/Viacom logo too), but the shorter edition is the one that's been in general circulation over the past four decades. It's surprising that Republic didn't toot their own horn about having made this longer version available. Did they even realize it was a longer version?

The pictorial quality of this DVD is stunning. Every other edition I've seen -- including a 35mm print that dated back to 1953 -- looked like it was processed on outdated film stock, giving the picture a dimly-lit pictorial quality. Not so in this case: the image is sharp and distinct, giving this independent production a glossy, polished look it did not possess before.

None of the ""new"" scenes are what I'd call major sequences ... though, happily, additional gags conceived by Frank Tashlin (SON OF PALEFACE, ARTISTS AND MODELS, THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT) are now reinstated. (Unhappily, there's no extra footage of Marilyn Monroe.) I'm puzzled why these cuts were made in the first place -- in some instances it only shortens a scene by a matter of seconds.

Comparing the DVD to the old VHS edition, these are the restored sequences I noticed: the original introduction to Chico's character, narrated by Groucho; Harpo feeding a string of hot dogs to hungry actors inside a bull costume; Groucho showing the audience snapshots of him and Ilona Massey romping together in various locales; Harpo whirling around inside a giant washing machine while a gleeful Raymond Burr looks on; an additional encounter between Chico and Leon Belasco, narrated by Groucho; Melville Cooper showing Ilona Massey X-rays of Harpo; additional sight gags during the climactic rooftop chase (although there`s still a clumsy fadeout during the chase). Plus, there are additional, fleeting quips from Groucho (none of which are especially funny), as well as different music scoring for some scenes.

Again, I'm not sure why this movie was tinkered with. Why would United Artists, the original theatrical distributor, remove a number of Groucho's bits when he has so little to do to begin with? For that matter, why cut any Marx scenes in a film that has superfluous footage involving secondary characters?

The extra footage is fascinating to watch but it doesn't change my overall opinion of LOVE HAPPY. I think that the film has a number of very funny and imaginative scenes, but it still ranks as a lesser Marx effort. Nevertheless, if you're a true Marx Brothers fan, you'll want (and need) this DVD for your collection.",1218672000,11,3062,4.996078431372549
223959,3,6300208672,"This was the first Marx Brothers movie I ever saw, and because of that, for quite some time I had the wrong impression of them, judging them by this pale weak mediocre movie.  Thankfully, in the years since I've become familiar with their other 12 films and have realised that what I first saw was not at all representative of their true talents, and the reason why 'Love Happy' is so weak and unrepresentative.  If someone goes into the viewing experience expecting a Marx Brothers movie, s/he'll likely be as disappointed and turned off as I was, but if one knows that it's essentially a solo vehicle for Harpo, a project in which his brothers just happen to star also, one will probably feel more kindly towards it.

I get the feeling that if this had stayed Harpo's solo project, and his brothers hadn't been roped into appearing as well since the studio thought it would never sell otherwise, it could have been at least a halfway decent and fun little movie.  It might not have been a great movie, but it also wouldn't have fallen as flat as the end result ended up doing.  I feel bad for him, knowing how long he'd wanted to do a solo film and how much this project meant to him, only to have it fail so miserably, so much so he never even mentioned the film in his memoirs.  And the scenes where he appears alone are mostly quite good and funny, one last glimpse of the mischievous sprite, a really good screen farewell (not counting 'The Story of Mankind').  Although it is a bit disconcerting to see some of the closeups of him, where the illusion of this ageless clown gives way to the realisation that he was in his early sixties at the time and no longer as (relatively) young as he'd been at the peak of their career.  Although appearing older didn't really hurt Groucho--he just went from a dirty young man to a dirty old man.  He didn't really serve much of a purpose in this film, though, although he's as great as ever in the scenes he does get.  (I've heard it mentioned that the wackier his name his, the funnier and wackier the film will be.  Here his name is Sam Grunion, and this film is even worse than 'Room Service,' where his name was Gordon Miller.)

The major problem with this movie isn't really that the three brothers never get an entire scene together (though it does seem wasteful to have them all in the same movie yet never put them all together at the same time), but that it's just not consistent.  Again, if this had remained Harpo's solo film, there probably wouldn't have been so many needless subplots or storylines that we never see really tied up or ended satisfactorily.  The film is also marred by too many musical numbers, something that also hurt many of their post-Paramount films.  They contribute nothing to the storyline, although I suppose that a song like ""Who Stole That Jam?"" isn't quite as nightmare-enducing as ""The Tenement Symphony.""  We also have the requisite pseudo-Zeppo and the romantic subplot, although at least the pseudo-Zeppo in this picture isn't as actively annoying or nauseating as the ones in 'At the Circus' or 'The Big Store.'  Even so, the viewer never really feels connected to these secondary characters, because unlike the romantic couples in 'A Night at the Opera' and 'A Day at the Races,' they're not really fully integrated into the plot surrounding the brothers, while at the same time they take up too much of the plot.  Most people don't watch the Marx Brothers' movies because they want to see secondary characters taking up all the action!  And there are times when one just feels like they're too old to still be doing this anymore, because it's just getting silly for men who are in their late fifties and early sixties to still be going on like this and doing their old act.  A particularly vivid example is the scene where Harpo is miming to Chico that Maggie is in trouble.  The pantomime scene in ADATR was funny and original, and the one in 'A Night in Casablanca' wasn't quite as funny or fresh, but it seemed right since there were so many scenes and gags in that picture hearkening back to things from their earlier films, like a poignant summing up of their entire career.  Here it just goes on way too long, and gets extremely embarrassing and painful to watch.  Now I understand why some people feel that the pantomime scene in ADATR marked the end of Harpo as a character who didn't talk and the beginning of him as one who couldn't talk.

Even so, in spite of the problems, there are enough funny scenes and gags for this movie to not be a complete waste.  It's still the weakest of their movies, but even a film where they never appear together at the same time still has some of that old magic and is better than much of what passes for comedy today.  Just don't let it be your first Marx Brothers movie.",1141948800,13,4811,4.507479861910242
223960,3,6300208672,"Though this was not the last time the Marx Brothers would appear together (cameo appearances in THE STORY OF MANKIND and the 1959 television show THE GREAT JEWEL ROBBERY), it was their final collaboration on the big screen.  LOVE HAPPY is essentially a Harpo film with Chico doing his best to keep pace.  Groucho's brief segments could probably have been cut from the film without disturbing the story.

LOVE HAPPY combines two plots.  The first is about group of struggling young actors laboring to assemble a stage show -- somewhat similar to the ROOM SERVICE's storyline.  The subplot involves a band of jewel smugglers whose contraband diamonds mistakenly end up in the theater.

Harpo, whose character also goes by the name of Harpo in the story, is the troupe's scavenger.  Chico also wanders into the theater in search of a job.  Yes, Harpo plays the harp and Chico tickles the piano keys.  In fact, the movie is based on a story created by Harpo Marx.

What about Groucho, you ask?  Groucho Marx originally did not want much more than a cameo role in this movie.  The producer felt that a Marx Brothers movie with Groucho would have better box office draw than a Harpo and Chico film.  By the late 1940's, Groucho put his Marx Brothers days behind him.  It did not really matter anyway.  Wise-cracking Groucho the character was inseparable from Groucho the actor.  Groucho kept his distance from film because he believed that radio and television broadcast was the future of entertainment.  Despite his reluctance, Groucho was convinced to contribute a handful of scenes, including 45 seconds with Marilyn Monroe, and supply occasional narration to the film.  Indeed, the three Marx Brothers do not appear together until the chase scene at the conclusion of the film.

Despite Groucho's demand for higher salary in order to appear in the film, he was paid approximately half of what he was used to receiving for a movie.  Remember that at this period in Groucho's career, he was involved in the wildly successful radio -- and later television -- quiz show, ""You Bet Your Life.""  Money was rolling into Groucho's bank account without having to endure lengthy film shoots.  The success of his radio program only served to reinforce Groucho's postion that his motion picture days were over.

We also see a slightly changed Groucho in LOVE HAPPY.  Gone are the grease painted eyebrows and exaggerated mustache of earlier years.  Groucho's conservatively trimmed mustache was for real.  Groucho's hair had also thinned considerably since A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA.  Abandonment of grease painted eyebrows only served to make Groucho look older.

It is fitting that LOVE HAPPY was the finale for the Marx Brothers.  In comparing LOVE HAPPY to earlier Marx Brothers films, Harpo and Chico are out of place.  In the early films, particularly those completed at Paramount's Long Island studios, the zany Marx Brothers did not appear unusual in a setting where everyone was somewhat looney anyway.  The Paramount Marx Brothers films were the Leslie Nielsen NAKED GUNs of their day.  In their later films at RKO and then MGM, the Marx Brothers remained zany, but the world around them took on a more serious tone.  By the time of A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA, the bad guys were actually villainous.  The romantic subplot was believable. Life, liberty, and property hung in the balance.  It became more difficult to accept that the three Marxes could be on the loose in society.

Accelerating the end of the Marx Brothers era, well before LOVE HAPPY, was that Margaret Dumount, Groucho's foil for years, retired.  Additionally, handsome Zeppo Marx left the team at the conclusion of their Paramount films.  In the early films, Zeppo almost always played the romantic lead.  In subsequent films another actor, normally a crooner, played the part of the handsome boyfriend lead in a romantic subplot that was very removed from the Marx comedy.  In watching the later films, I am tempted to skip the non-Marx musical numbers and dance routines.  It is like watching two separate films cobbled together with only a thread of story continuity.

In LOVE HAPPY, Harpo and Chico are as out of place in this film as Buster Keaton is in the surfer movies of the 1960s.  This was also very evident in one of Groucho's 1947 solo attempts.  COPACABANA was essentially a Marx Brothers movie without the Marx Brothers.  In COPACABANA, Groucho's antics were equally out of place in an otherwise normal world.  Though it is great to see them together again in LOVE HAPPY, it is also sad if you compare this film their early motion pictures.

The rooftop ending of the LOVE HAPPY is novel, though it is not what was originally scripted.  The film company ran out of money and solicited commercial sponsorship from companies.  Thus explains the rooftop chase past lighted billboards.

The current DVD release is very high quality.  Prior to buying a DVD copy of LOVE HAPPY, I had not seen the film in 30 years.  It was good to see it again.  Despite the criticisms I have leveled at the movie, I recommend you complete your Marx Brothers DVD collection with this picture.  Unfortunately the DVD contains no special features.  Also, for Marilyn Monroe fans, the cover of the DVD is slightly misleading.  Groucho and Marilyn appear on the DVD cover.  It is all about marketing as Monroe appears only briefly in the film and Groucho has much less camera time than Harpo or Chico.",1123545600,16,5442,4.87350054525627
223961,3,6300208672,"Released in 1950 after a troubled production history, ""Love Happy"" should be viewed as a showcase for the talents of Harpo Marx. On that level, it's an enjoyable but uneven film. Harpo's attempt at Chaplinesque pathos is fascinating  if not entirely successful. However, the rooftop chase is quite inventive and Groucho (in a brief role for box-office purposes) has a memorable encounter with Marilyn Monroe. No classic, but less painful to watch than ""At the Circus"" and ""The Big Store."" After years of second-generation dupes, the DVD features an excellent 35mm pre-release print that is six minutes longer than the 85-minute theatrical version. Groucho's narration now makes more sense and includes some Robert Benchley-inspired commentary. Along the way, there are occasional gags with Harpo and Chico that the Hays Office deemed inappropriate for the official release. Despite a few continuity errors, the pre-release print of ""Love Happy"" is superior to the finished product. Marxists rejoice!",1103587200,18,999,5.445161290322581
223962,3,6300208672,"""Love Happy"" is remembered, primarily, as the last ""Official"" Marx Brothers film (they would all appear in brief vignettes in ""The Story of Mankind"", seven years later, but not as a team), but if the film were a baseball statistic, it would have an asterik (*), because it truly isn't a showcase of the brothers, together, but a comedy starring Harpo, with Chico in a supporting role, and Groucho doing narration, and making brief appearances, occasionally.

As a comedy, ""Love Happy"" is so-so, with Harpo providing some genuine laughs, particularly during an interrogation scene with villains Raymond Burr, Ilona Massey, Eric Blore, and Bruce Gordon, and in the rooftop finale, with Harpo offering the same kind of outrageous physical humor that he had demonstrated in the classic Paramount and MGM comedies. But the rest of the plot, while mildly entertaining, is simply a musical variation of ""Room Service"", as an impoverished group of performers (headed by Paul Valentine and future star Vera-Ellen) struggle to put on a Broadway musical, 'spiced' up with a stolen jewelry subplot that isn't that interesting.

The back story of the film is possibly more entertaining than the movie, itself; Harpo had wanted to make a solo film throughout the forties, and had tinkered on the script for several years, while soliciting financial backing for the project. Chico, meanwhile, was running up huge gambling debts, as was often the case (while a brilliant card player, he was a notoriously bad gambler), and just as the Marxes had made ""A Night in Casablanca"", in 1946, to pay off his debts at that time, Harpo brought him into ""Love Happy"" to do the same. Unfortunately, the end of the decade was a depressed time for film making (with the studios forced to give up their lucrative theater chains, and television making inroads into the ticket-buying public), and backers would only fund the project if all three brothers would appear in the movie.

Groucho, by now a genuine TV star, thanks to the ""You Bet Your Life"" quiz show, hated the script of ""Love Happy"", and had little desire to co-star in the film. He was, however, loyal to his brothers, and finally reached a compromise; he would only appear briefly, would not have to wear his trademark greasepaint eyebrows and mustache, and would have final approval of his dialog and the performers working with him. He could honestly say he helped 'discover' Marilyn Monroe, at an open audition (watching two other starlets walk across a stage, followed by Marilyn, when asked for his pick for a small role, he raised his eyebrows and quipped, ""You're kidding, right?"")

As Universal and Warner Brothers have now released two wonderful boxed collections of all of the Marx Brothers' other feature films, this edition of ""Love Happy"" is essential, to complete the filmography of the classic team. But be warned: ""Love Happy"" is no ""Night at the Opera"", or ""Duck Soup""!",1102291200,37,2918,4.961145194274029
223963,4,6300208672,"I'm a life long Marx Brothers fanatic.  I've seen Love Happy more than 25 times during that span.  Now I feel as though I'm seeing for the very first time.  Apparently, there are 6 minutes in this version that have been missing from every print I've seen previously, and it turns out that this 6 minutes is essential.  I always thought that Love Happy was a choppy mess of a film (although I always preferred it to Go West, and Room Service....sorry), but now, with this pristine print that has obviously been struck from the original negative, it is a smooth, funny, and very entertaining romp.  The print makes it look like a bigger budgeted film, and the added footage makes it a far nicer ride.  The film itself is not prime Marx Bros., but I think it is a much better film than the print that has been circulating for years. You'll just have to see for yourself.  I am flabergasted that this release hasn't been more touted because, in my opinion, it is a major find.

Now how about a clean copy of Horsefeathers????",1101945600,35,1021,4.451612903225806
224004,2,6300208672,"Some reviews have understated the problems here. Marylin's cameo is not even one minute long - it's more like 30 seconds, and not very memorable. In fact, Marylin is completely upstaged by female lead Vera-Ellen (someone I'd never heard of), who has a very sexy dance number.

Not only does Groucho appear very little, but until the very end he does not interact with his brothers. Apparently they decided to add him at the last minute and shot several solo scenes featuring him that are interspersed throughout the film. This is unfortunate because Groucho's persona, in my opinion, was the center of the Marx brothers act. Harpo's antics grow wearisome in extended doses, and Chico is even more limited. Groucho, after all, was the one who always dropped cynical comments about the mediocre romantic storylines that were attached to the later Marx films, and thus made it possible to endure those storylines. Without his presence here, we are overwhelmed with the shabby, sentimental story about a theatrical troupe trying to put on a Broadway show.

There is one thing to recommend the film - it has Chico's most amusing piano number (after the one in Animal Crackers), as he attempts to improvise a duet with a violinist.",1100995200,6,1225,4.913043478260869
224005,3,6300208672,"But hey, not every movie can be, can it not?  I will confess that until I got the DVD, ""Love Happy"" was the only Marx Bros. movie I had never seen!  I had seen all the other 12 COUNTLESS times. Now, there's been a lot people saying the movie was plain awful (even Groucho and Harpo never mention the movie in their autobiographies), and maybe compared to the earlier Paramounts it's considered a letdown. I think they were being too hard on themselves.

All considering, I thought it was a solid effort, but it was bogged down with too much music (not the brothers' tunes-everybody else's).  I thoroughly enjoyed watching Chico managing to cause chaos and confusion wherever he went, and butchering the English language as usual...........I absolutely cracked up when he says ""Ah-Tootsie Frootsie"" in a scene where Harpo hands him an ice cream cone.....I loved the ""noodling around"" bit he did where he played ""Gyspy Love Song"" just like he did in ""Cocoanuts"" 20 years earlier.  I often wonder if he knew this was the ""official"" swan song of the Brothers' movie career..........Chico would have gladly kept going, even if the others didn't.  (I'm not counting ""The Story of Mankind"" as the ""last"" movie, because they had 3 separate roles in it).

Groucho uncharacteristically, has more of a role as a narrator, but he still manages to be typical Groucho. When he is in a scene, he's hilarious.  His best line, is of course, when Marilyn Monroe (all 45 seconds of her) walks into his office (he's Detective Sam Grunion) and says, ""Some men are following me"" to which Groucho replies, ""Really? I can't imagine why"" and raises his eyebrows in typical Groucho fashion.

Of course, the star here is Harpo, and I think he's brilliant. His scene with Ilona Massey and Raymond Burr (who's trying not to laugh at Harp) when they try to get him to ""talk"" is hilarious! And the chase scene towards the end of the movie is great, despite all the ""product placement"" up on the buildings and such; it's still well done.  Harpo was just Harpo, and he nevers fails to deliver. He came up with the story after all. I think the movie was pretty good, and even though I wouldn't start with this movie if you are new to the Brothers Marx, I still recommend it.  Harpo, Chico, and Groucho in a good, but not great, movie are still better than half of the junk that is called humor gracing our theater screens (does ANYBODY know how  to do an original movie instead of countless remakes?) nowadays.  I think most people will be pleased with the Marxes' last effort.  Give it a chance, it might surprise you!  It did me.",1092009600,7,2597,4.6152173913043475

224007,3,6300208672,"In the first place:  God never meant for 60 year old Marx Brothers to make movies. That being said, the story goes that Harpo wanted to do a film by himself.  But he couldn't get the up front financing unless he included Chico and Groucho.  And, as such, Chico and Groucho make mainly ""cameo"" appearances.  The plot is as flimsy as a ""survivor"" episode:  Harpo protrays a kind of loving angel for a group of struggling artists.  And, in one case, while stealing some food for his friends, he unknowingly swipes some diamonds.  And the rest of the ""plot"" involves the disposition of the diamonds.  Some plot, huh?  But there ARE some real gems in ""Love Happy,"" though:  just Marilyn Monroe's mere presence, her all-too-brief cameo with Groucho justifies the film.  And Chico delivers one of his funniest lines in all thirteen of the Marx Brothers films:  while trying to divert a creditor from repossessing >something, I don't know, does it matter?< Seems the creditor likes to ""noodle"" around with the violin - and Chico, trying to buy time, replies, ""Well, you noodle on that and I'll macaroni on this.""

In fact, over 6 minutes of footage I have never seen. Not on previous release versions on VHS, Laserdisc, at the LaPaloma Theatre when I projected it in 35mm or in my own 16mm print! The footage adds a LOT to the movie. In one scene Groucho describes how he has tracked the sexy Madame Egelich (Illona Massey) all over the world. He whips out a series of Photos showing them to us the audience with him holding Illona in various sexy poses. Concluding with one photo of her in a 1950's style batheing suit. Another restored scene has Chico, who assigns himself the task of stopping the owner of the theatre from kicking the troupe out for lack of rent payment. Before the drooling owner is paraded a bevy of beauties. Groucho says in the voiceover, ""He wisely chose the Blonde on the end"". Pretty racy by 50's standards. We even get a new scene where Raymond Burr tortures Harpo by placing him in a giant washing machine! There are additional small scenes sprinkled thruout, but those are the best. WOW! It is so great to see new footage of Groucho, Harpo and Chico. BUY this disc! You will be Happy you did. Johno",1087257600,7,1248,4.383620689655173

I wouldn't even technically call this a Marx Brothers movie considering Chico & Groucho have no scenes together and Groucho & Harpo only have 1 scene together.  Groucho also gets the lone scene with miss Marilyn Monroe.  Marilyn Monroe appears on the screen for maybe 30 seconds and although I was never a fan of hers you could kind of sense a strong presence about her for that brief time she was in the movie.  I couldn't enjoy this movie thoroughly with Groucho narrating and Harpo as the star.  The plot was ok but it was an extremly bad ending and just not what you would expect from the Marx Brothers...their true last performance was in ""A Night In Casablanca"" which was actually a pretty good movie.

""Duck Soup"" and ""A Night At The Opera"", but don't judge this film too harshly. Watch the movie, see what you think, you're entitled to your opinion. I think this movie is pretty good. Harpo has center stage instead of all of them, mainly Groucho, in the spotlight. Groucho only has a secondary role and appears in about 1/3 of the film. Harpo as himself is kept an eye on by Ilona Massey as she tries to get her greedy hands on a diamond necklace. This becomes unoticingly passed through a group of actors rehearsing a show. As Chico gets in on the action and Groucho steps in on the scene, the chase is on when the diamonds are hunted down...almost. Give this a try. You're going to laugh at a few parts, but again it isn't tops, but it's worth watching. Groucho's part is in 1/3 of the film as he delivers only one or two one-liners, but Chico and Harpo still display their musical talents. There is a hint of them sluggishingly getting through the film, but don't let it detract you from seeing the brothers' final film together.",1046131200,3,1075,4.38
224011,4,6300208672,"While it's not the best of the Marx Brothers movies, Love Happy is important for several reasons.  First, it is the Marx Brothers' last film together; second, Harpo Marx wrote the story; and third, it marks Marilyn Monroe's big screen debut (not counting the exceedingly small bit parts she had landed before 1949).  I am sure I'm not the only person to buy this movie just to see Marilyn, and she is unmistakably dazzling in her brief appearance, making quite an impression on Groucho and a number of contemporary moviegoers.  While you may see her featured prominently on the video jacket, be aware that her screen time, as memorable as it is, lasts no more than a minute.  With Groucho's own time fairly limited, the onus for making this movie funny and enjoyable falls on Harpo and Chico Marx, and they don't disappoint.
Groucho plays detective Sam Grunion, and he narrates the first two-thirds of the movie before actually getting involved in the action.  He is on the trail of the stolen Romanoff diamonds, but initially he is two steps behind Madame Egelichi and her henchmen (one of whom is Raymond Burr is a very un-Perry Mason-like role).  As things work out, Egelichi is herself two steps behind Harpo, who unwittingly snatches the can of sardines holding the diamonds while filching food to feed a group of struggling off-Broadway players.  These players aren't crucial to the plot, but Vera-Ellen shines as Maggie Phillips, dancer, actress, and all-around enchanting young woman.  Chico worms his way into the production, serves as Harpo's interpreter in a couple of crucial scenes, and helps Harpo protect Maggie and the other players from danger.  Groucho joins in at the end to make the diamond-hunting foray a full-blown farce worthy of the Marx Brothers.
Of course, it wouldn't be a Marx Brothers movie without some music, and Love Happy features two excellent performances.  Chico shows off on the piano, and Harpo treats us to a beautiful harp solo.  I can't say Love Happy made me bust a gut laughing, but it was certainly a very enjoyable movie.  As a huge Marilyn Monroe fan, I also have to say that her performance, short as it is, was wonderful and in no way disappointing.  I would have liked to have seen more of Groucho in the movie, but Harpo and Chico prove rather convincingly that the Marx Brothers are much more than just Groucho.",1045699200,58,2363,4.8049382716049385
224012,1,6300208672,"Let's face it: if you've seen all the Brothers' fims dozens of times, and read at least ONE of the bios like me (try Adamson's now-legendary book-- the best of all, if you can locate an out-of-print copy) you must admit this: by Marxian standards this is a sad effort.  FACT: the only reason they all agreed (virtually kicking and screaming) to do ""Love Happy"" was that Chico, a serious and debt-ridden gambler, desperately needed the money.  Screen legend Lillian Gish helped finance it and all the product ""ads"" at the end were sold to get  the production completed, but not much can save this film as a vehicle for ALL the brothers, as do at least 11 of the 13 they did.  It's Harpo's film, and he was always brilliant. Chico and Groucho  (who is basically at the begining and the end ) have a few scattered funny moments, but even Groucho himself later said he hated this film.
  As one other reviewer accurately noted, they were old and tired of it all in 1950, and ""Love Happy"" shows it.
