8343598,3,B001UF0586,"Frank Oz and others had a huge debate over making this movie dark, menacing or light, fluffy, and it shows. One minute it has Mathew Brodrick making hidden malice faces and the next moment they are cracking jokes about AOL. However by not trying to follow the formula of a strict remake they came out from the shadow of the original and make a stand alone movie on its own. The commentary track was just as good, if not better than the movie it's self.

The actors themselves were quite good:
Nicole Kidman of ""Natural Magic"" fame, as usual can look so emotional.
Mathew Broderick looked like Farris Buller with a secret.
Bete Midler was just being herself(s).
Christopher Walken adds that sinister touch. Nothing mechanical.
Faith Hill adds real spark to the movie.
Glen Close can keep a strait face.

Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) has it all and puts her whole life into her career. Through a series of miss events when she goes in to what she expects would be a raise is let go. The trauma sends her over the deep end. Her husband quits working for the same network to care for her. He only wants the BEST. So they moved to the quainter environment of Stepford. There Men can be men and Women can be women.  Joanna being her cantankerous self has trouble adjusting to life and the people around her that only wanted to help. Her husband threatens to leave her if she does not change her ways. So she does and solicits the help of tow other disgruntled friends.
Will she really change?
If not what can be done?
Why is the mechanical dog asking for help?",1264118400,2,1557,4.475352112676056
