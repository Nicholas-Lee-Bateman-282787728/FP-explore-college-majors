8501793,5,B006OBAMRU,"There are now loads of knife making DVDs available but very few cover folders. Of those very few this is by far the best. The presenter is a well known custom knife maker who has achieved great popularity for designing and making superb folding knives. He really knows his stuff and it shows on this video. He is also a great presenter which makes this video stand above many others on the market.

He explains things clearly as he goes along and the sequence of steps is clearly illustrated.

After watching this DVD I was able to go out to the workshop and make a similar knife without too much trouble. If you listen and follow his instructions carefully I think anyone could make a liner lock folder with basic workshop tools.

One DVD that should be on your knife making reference shelf.",1362441600,2,792,4.524475524475524
