8130662,4,B000GDH8N8,"I see a number of reviews comparing this set with the wonderfully fun movie, The Final Countdown.  I find myself disagreing with the comparison.  Other than the fact that the two share the Pacific Ocean, time travel, and the military, they have little in common.  Zipang takes a Japanese Self Defense Force ship and crew 60 years into the past and abandons them to their fate.  There is no E-Ticket from Tideman Industries to prevent potential time paradoxes.  Point in fact, the writers threw the paradox theory away and I appaude the decision - it's one I've never supported.  This is just an act-and-react life-and-death struggle for survival.  Modern day Japanese people find themselves trapped between their more agressive ancestors and a less than forgiving America during one of history's most chaotic eras.  I find the story well written and nicely displayed.  Every sub story supports the whole and all the characters are well scripted and believable.  Neither is the show biased.  Good and evil are not determined by a person's language, and no one ever really wins a war.  Naval surface actions were a little abrupt - they could have been better had more time and attention to detail been spent - so this doesn't get 5 stars.  It will get watched many more times, however, and I will enjoy every moment.  The opening theme song is catchy as well.",1337212800,,1357,4.818181818181818
8130663,5,B000GDH8N8,"I have to admit that I really didn't know too much about this anime.  After watching ""Submarine 707R"", I wanted to watch another anime that dealt with the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force and another series that features the latest in technology of the military carried out on sea.  Especially since the original author of the manga series, Kawaguchi Kaiji was the original author of the classic anime OAV ""Silent Service"".

So, what better than to watch the anime series ""Zipang"", a series that is based on an ongoing (and award winning) manga series by Kawaguchi Kaiji.  The manga was made into a 26-episode TV series in 2004 and was released on DVD by Geneon in 2006.

The storyline is about the latest in Japanese technology, the modern battlecruiser known as the Mirai.  The Mirai and the crew of the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force is off to Pearl Harbor to meet up with the US for training but during their travel to Japan, they notice a strange occurence with the skies and the Mirai is hit by a bolt of lighting.  Next thing you know, the Mirai and its crew are transported back to 1942 during World War II.

The main storyline focuses on three close friends and members of the SDF who are stationed on the Mirai:

Kadomatsu Yosuke - Second in Command of the Mirai and has a sense of duty to protect people.  Yosuke's actions is what changes the course of history when he rescues an Imperial Japanese Navy Commissioned Officer Kusaka Izumi.  A man who should of perished in battle.

Kikuchi Masayuki - Gunnery officer and third in command and in the beginning of the anime series, is totally against getting involved in fear that the Mirai and crew could change history.

Oguri Kouhei - Navigation officer and shares the duty of third in command with Kikuchi.  Of the three best friends, Oguri is the most outspoken.

Throughout the series, you are introduced to several other characters in the Mirai such as Captain Umezu Saburo and Lt. and Mirai medic, Momoi Sachiko.

In episode 1, ""The Mirai Sets Sail"", the series features how the Mirai is transported sixty years into the past and try to understand what happened to them.

In episode 2, ""Midway"", fortunately the Mirai has a history buff in its crew who tells them that on that day, June 4, 1942 is the Battle of Midway in which the Americans destroyed the Japanese fleet.  Of course, the Mirai, has the power to possibly save the Japanese fleet but under Kikuchi's logic, the Mirai and its crew should not interfere with history and should find a way to get back home.

In episode 3, ""Drifters"", the crew debate to save a Japanese plane that has a survivor.  Due to Kadomatsu's sense of protecting lives, he saves the survivor (Kusaka Izumi) who happens to be an officer of the Imperial Navy.  Kikuchi knows by Kadomatsu's action, history will now be changed.

In episode 4, ""Mirai's Battle"", the Mirai returns to the spot they where they were transported back in time.  While they wait to see if anything will happen to them, the Mirai is under attack by an American submarine.  Of course, with technology on their side, the Mirai is able to escape from the torpedo's but one of Kikuchi's men who is caught up of having to decide if Japan should get their revenge on the Americans, fires a missle on his own against the submarine.  Now the Mirai must decide whether or not they should attack the Americans or destroy the missle and knowing the Americans will relay info. about what they learned about the Mirai back to their headquarters.

Overall, the series is in good hands with Furuhashi Kazuhiro as director.  Furuhashi has been a director for series like ""Urusei Yatsura"", ""You're Under Arrest"", ""Getbackers"" and more.  Character designer Umakoshi Yoshihiko created character designs for anime series such as ""Street Fighter"", ""Berserk"" and ""Air Master"" and Takeda Yuichiro who wrote the screenplay will be known for his work on the multi-anime series ""Banner of the Stars"".

VIDEO:

The video is featured in 16:9 and felt the animation looked great.  With the waves of the ocean that ship makes, to the skies brilliantly painted to showcase a storm or a sunny day.  The animation was very well done and the colors showcasing the darkness inside the Mirai to outdoor missions were well done.  Character designs were well done as well.

AUDIO:

The audio is in Japanese Dolby Digital 2.0 and I watched both the Japanese and English dub versions and both were well done.  It would have been cool if the series was digital 5.1 to showcase the sound of the missiles and blasts but all in all, dialogue was clear and had no problems with it.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There wasn't really any special features except three Geneon trailers and a clean opening and ending theme for the series.

I have to admit that ""Zipang"" features an interesting concept of time travel and if given the opportunity to have modern technology, would you help your countrymen from a different era or not disrupt history and you can see it among the crew of the Mirai.  Loyalty to their country but at the same time, those who don't know what effect by saving the Imperial Army will do in their timeline.

I will say that I am aware that the series ends with a cliffhanger and because the manga series is still ongoing, it'll probably be quite sometime before another anime series is created or if it is ever created.

As for the anime, there are a total of seven volumes and vol. 1 can be found pretty inexpensively but finding the other volumes online is hit or miss and some are still being sold for regular price.  I hope there will be a complete collection out for ""Zipang"" with the team up of Geneon and Funimation.

But overall, watching the first volume was quite intriguing and left me wanting more.",1224460800,2,5752,4.663690476190476

8130665,5,B000GDH8N8,"Zipang is the story of a modern-era Aegis cruiser built by American contractors after the year 2000, in the hands of the Japanese Defense Force, being thrown back in time to 1942, into the midst of the Battle of Midway.
Zipang is unusual in Japanime, which is usually rife with action constantly. If you're looking for a Guyver or Gundum, this is not it; in the first four episodes there is exactly one battle, and even in it they do their best NOT to destroy the enemy vessel.
The crew of the cruiser are torn between their allegiances, on one hand they were trained to be allies of the American Navy, on the other thousands of Japanese sailors are dying before their eyes.
Despite the relative lack of action in this series, it is likely the very best Japanime I have ever experienced. the historical details of the era of WWII are flawless...as are the technical and operational details of how an Aegis class cruiser operates.
If you're a fan of both anime and WWII (as I am) this is a total win. Especially if you watch it in the original Japanese voices, (with English subtitles if needed). I say this quite seriously, the Canadian/English voice-cast is the one truly vulgar and broken thing about this series. But that's not the fault of the Japanese writers and animators, who made this one a win.",1198108800,,1304,4.576923076923077
8130666,5,B000GDH8N8,"A few things that I like about this anime:

The characters are very real, and some of the moral delemas they have are interesting. There is a sense of great confussion and a bit of anxiety among the crew also which fits well with the events of the story.

The military weapons and systems they use in the series are accuratly portrayed also. This series shows how powerfull a modern day destroyer truly is.

I would recommend this series strongly to anyone interested in ww2 history . Even if your not into history it's a great story that most will enjoy.",1176595200,,555,4.475247524752476
8130667,4,B000GDH8N8,"The newest cruiser in the Japanese Defense Force, the Mirai, is headed to Pearl Harbor, along with some escort ships, to engage in joint operations with American forces but on the way there, it gets caught in a strange electrical storm. After they come out of it, they surprisingly find themselves adrift in a sea with its escorts missing. That's not to say there are no ships around. In fact they find themselves in the midst of a fleet of 40, among them what looks like the legendary Japanese warship the Yamoto, which should be lying on the seafloor, sunk over 60 years ago! Incredibly it seems the Marai has travelled back in time to June 4th, 1942, the day before the Battle of Midway, which would see the destruction of the Japanese Navy and the beginning of a slow end to one half of World War II. Now the crew must decide whether they are going to stay out of the battle and find a way back to their own time, or try to aid their countrymen, even though doing so might wreck the time continuum.

Yes, this all might sound familiar to anyone who saw the old 1980s flick ""The Final Countdown"", but Zipang is fascinating none the less because the human mind will always be intrigued by ""What Ifs?"", especially when a war is viewed by the aggressor that lost the said war. Japan to me sometimes tries to ludicrously paint itself as the victim of World War II instead of the instigator it truly was. So the writer of this show steers dangerously close to idealizing those Japanese soldiers who died for a divine emperor who was pitifully human and a military that lusted for death. The crew of the Marai seem to be in the same quandary, not knowing whether to root for their own country, because who truly wishes Japan had won the war? They would have made the Nazis look tolerant!  I liked the characters and it's cool that the show takes its time with each one and gives them a lot of personality. The animation too is great, combining more traditional animation techniques with CG to give the show a GONZO feel. Great first volume.",1161734400,,2037,4.458445040214477
