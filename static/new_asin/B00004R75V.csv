1341234,5,B00004R75V,"This will be an odd offbeat review so consider yourself warned. I first saw this movie on the late night channel as I was laying in a hospital bed at the age of 17. I was in agony I had driven myself to the hospital after I had an attack of a infected appendix. They could not get the surgeon sooner and I was NOT allowed any pain meds. A stupid bag of ice was all I had for the awful pain. So I had nothing to do while my surgeon sobered up except watch tv. So when this movie came on and I saw both Robert Mitchum and Vincent Price in his funniest role ever, I concentrated hard to avoid thinking about the pain. So I LOVE LOVE this movie because for me it kept me company and my mind off the agony of a inflamed appendix as I layed doubled over in a hospital bed alone at 4 a.m.. RKO built it's first new set since the war for this movie and it looks great. Just the combo of all the actors and the added comedy made 'this mess of a movie' quite good. It worked. Actually the whole idea and the way this film was made is really quite modern with many films doing the same thing today mixing crime, comedy and sadism together a la Pulp Fiction.",1170115200,11,1146,3.965367965367965

Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell are a good match--very sexy and sort of touching for two tough cookies.

I loved this movie.",1158883200,18,428,5.0
1341236,5,B00004R75V,"The fact that ""His Kind of Woman"" achieves coherence is miraculous. One third of the film rewritten after its completion, reshoots, and scenes recast and reshot again at the insistence of executive producer Howard Hughes transformed this movie into particularly brutal film noir juxtaposed with romantic comedy and topped off with farce. It sounds like a recipe for disaster, but ""His Kind of Woman"" is splendid. The movie's title gives the impression of a clever romantic comedy featuring RKO's biggest stars at the time, Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell. And so it is. Sassy and sexy with sharp dialogue by Frank Fenton and Jack Leonard. But this is also, clearly and consciously, a menacing, introverted crime film in which Robert Mitchum's world-weary gambler has sold his fate without knowing what it is, and he's increasingly anxious to find out.

Crime boss Nick Ferraro (Raymond Burr) is eager to return to the United States to take control of his troubled syndicate but can't set foot over the U.S. border without being recognized. Ferraro's agent offers gambler Dan Milner (Robert Mitchum) $50,000 to leave the United States for a year so that Ferraro can assume Milner's identity to enter the U. S. Milner is to wait it out at a posh Mexican resort, Morro's Lodge. En route to the Lodge, Milner meets Lenore Brent (Jane Russell), a songstress claiming to be a millionaire, headed the same direction. At Morro's Lodge, Lenore tries to get a marriage proposal out of her daffy movie star boyfriend Mark Cardigan (Vincent Price). Cardigan is more interested in hunting. Lenore is more interested in Milner. And Milner is desperate to learn if he should expect a bullet in the head or a nice Mexican vacation. Eventually, an undercover U. S. Immigration agent (Tim Holt) arrives to clear up that mystery.

It's odd to interweave a snappy, sophisticated romantic comedy with existential dread, but Robert Mitchum is as notably introverted and aloof as he is romantic and formidable. Milner sold his fate and thereby lost control of his life. He has no choice but to act like a tourist, enjoy the amenities, and await whatever comes. He tries to find out what the plans are for him, threatening one of Ferraro's men, ""I want information, and I'm beginning not to care how I get it."" No dice. He's adrift in a world he doesn't understand and cannot control. To emphasize the point, this film has the most low camera angles I have ever seen.  We spend a lot of time looking at the ceiling. But Milner has one distraction: The lovely Lenore, who is not what she says. The affable, self-absorbed Mark Cardigan keeps us all amused with his unconscious jabs at Hollywood culture. I can't praise Vincent Price's performance enough.

The unforgettable final act of ""His Kind of Woman"" juxtaposes the most sadistic violence ever seen in an American movie as of 1951 with some of the most successful farce ever -and gets away with it. Howard Hughes felt that ""His Kind of Woman"" ended too abruptly and insisted that the conclusion of the film be rewritten. The last 40 minutes were directed by Richard Fleischer, not John Farrow, who directed the original cut of the film, and partly written by Hughes, for a total running time of 2 hours -impossibly long in 1951. Milner's torture by Ferraro and his henchmen is cross-cut with Mark Cardigan's farcical attempts to enlist the Lodge's guests and Mexican police in rescuing Milner. Back-and-forth. One might think that Cardigan's antics were intended as comic relief, but they actually emphasize the horror of Milner's predicament. I found myself laughing out loud one minute and cringing the next. More than once. No one knows how it got past the Production Code Administration, but the last 40 minutes of ""His Kind of Woman"" are so effective and fascinating that you may want to watch them twice.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): The single bonus feature is a very good audio commentary by UCLA professor of film and television Vivian Sobchack. Ms. Sobchack talks about stars, characters, cinematography, art direction, and the problems that the film had with the PCA. She compares the film's comedic and noir tones. And she provides a lot of detail about Howard Hughes heavy-handed involvement in the last 40 minutes of the film and its results. The commentary is nearly constant, with Sobchack kindly pausing briefly so that we can hear particularly good dialogue. She does not discuss the noir themes in depth, as that does not seem to be her specialty. That may disappoint noir fans, but themes are easy to figure out for yourself, and the commentary offers a wealth of information on other aspects of the film and its amazing recreation. It's worth listening to the entire commentary. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French.",1158883200,37,4803,4.9100985221674875
1341237,4,B00004R75V,"His Kind of Woman should be a mess, but somehow it emerges as a highly enjoyable insane asylum of a movie as much thanks to as in spite of the constant interference by Howard Hughes: credited to John Farrow, Richard Fleischer spent months shooting and reshooting the yacht finale at the mogul's whims in a desperate attempt to get out of his own studio contract. Even Raymond Burr's villain is a case of third time lucky after Howard Petrie and Robert J. Wilke played the part without meriting Hughes' approval. Snappy dialogue (""You're the guy who shot (him). How did it feel?"" ""He didn't say."") unlucky gamblers, fortune-hunting gals, randy Wall Street types (played by no less than Mr Magoo himself, Jim Backus), Nazi plastic surgeons, Italian mobsters, Robert Mitchum betting his shoe and ironing his money, and a very wonderful hotel set courtesy of Albert D'Agostino - this has everything Hughes' money could buy. Mitch and Jane Russell have real chemistry, and she comes over as far more genuinely likeable than in many of her contemporary roles: for all the chaos, you get the sense that they're actually having fun (certainly she looks genuinely happy when she sings in her opening scene). But the show belongs to Vincent Price's ham actor, who doesn't fear death - he's too well-known to die - loves guns, never shuns the spotlight - even if it is wielded by gun-toting mobsters - but isn't too wild about his wife. He should destroy the movie if you're still expecting the bleak noir it began as, but by the time he appears you know that this is a log ride that drifts with the prevailing current and his outrageous hamming somehow compliments the sadism and prolonged action of the extended finale perfectly.

A shame that the DVD has a noticeable scratch during the yacht sequences",1156636800,24,1794,4.787096774193548
1341238,4,B00004R75V,"This is an early gangster film that is great fun.  Mitchum is duped into going to a resort in Mexico.  Why? So his identity can be stolen and used by Raymond Burr, a gangster, who wants to return to the states but can't because he has been deported.  The battle to maintain his ID is great fun to watch.  Jane Russell is his love interest and is typical sultry Jane.  Vincent Price is great as a Hollywood matinee idol who longs for real action rather than staged swordplay.  This movie needs to be released on DVD.  It is very hard to find on VHS and shows up occasionally on AMC or TNT.  By the way this filmed all on the backlot of the studio but it sure feels like your in Mexico.  I love this film, hope you will too. DCC",1137283200,11,726,4.092198581560283

  Mitchum, Price, Burr, and Russell are terrific. Price very nearly steals the film as an actor who is known for his swash buckling film roles (think Errol Flynn) and is his own biggest fan. And a wonderful role for Jim Backus who is having a mid-life crisis.
  Yes- it begins as a Noir. But about two thirds of the way through it turns into a comedy. A very enjoyable one at that!

1341245,2,B00004R75V,"I'm sorry but no.  The lead 5 star review calls this picture brilliant, a canny tour de force of genre-blending.  Tragicomic noir.  If the script's antics were intentional, if it knew what horse (or horses) it was on, maybe.  But then that would make it post-modern meta-noir, rather unique and startling for 1951, with nothing comparable in film history a decade before or after, and entirely out of character and reach for Howard Hughes.  At best -- the sinking rowboat shot straight out of Keaton, for example -- this thing becomes an oddly appealing send-up.  But of what?  To give the filmmakers credit for a bold and brilliant mash-up seems a stretch to me.  Is the screenplay a parody?  A cunning comment on style, tone, genre?  Or is this movie simply incoherent?  Just a mess?  I grant that the parts and pieces work well on their own.  Mitchum is Mitchum, Russell is Russell, Burr is Burr -- all eminently watchable.  And of course Vincent Price is, well, Vincent Price, although it must be admitted that his fulsome histrionics can put any motion picture in jeopardy (he almost ruins Laura, a noir classic).  But do the pieces fit together?  Is anybody at the helm?  I see no evidence to justify that praise.  I saw a film that for an hour bobbed noirishly about -- vaguely menacing, slightly shadowy, mildly intriguing if only because we have so little idea what's going on.  And then, an hour in, the script is suddenly hijacked by incomprehensible levity -- it reaches full-on farce -- as a troupe of Mexican / Keystone cops, pressed into service by Vincent Price himself, take over the picture.  I wonder what Mitchum and Burr, facing off in close-ups of deadly Dr. Mengele hypo-drama, possibly could have made of this.  People's jaws must have dropped at the first screening.",1472169600,2,1791,4.75

1341257,5,B00004R75V,"You have to give credit to Howard Hughes because the man knew how to make a film everyone could enjoy. Hughes' RKO Pictures produced His Kind of Woman in 1951 with John Farrow directing. Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell lead, while Vincent Price, Jim Backus, Raymond Burr and Tim Holt support. The film is similar to another Robert Mitchum film noir - Out of the Past (1947, Jacques Tourneur) - with it's Mexican setting, gangster/mobster antagonist, and rich film noir nuances. Yet it departs from film noir in three key aspects: (1) there is a subdued, battle-of-the-sexes banter throughout, which is usually found in romantic comedies; (2) a (genuine) exciting thriller aspect, and (3) it's beach resort, not urban, landscape. Wickedly sharp dialogue peppers the screen, while cinematography as an art form is at fever pitch. Mitchum is in classic form and has no trouble at all; Russell, a longtime Hughes protg and fine actress herself, gives a sensual yet not quite femme fatal performance as she is more Mitchum's equal throughout; and of course Vincent Price's expanded role here as a ham actor/amateur hunter infusing the film with comedy and unexpected loyalty. Also, several other actors break type in this film: Raymond Burr as the Lucky Luciano-esque gangster, Tim Holt as a fed., and Jim Backus playing a devil-with-a-grin resort guest.

The climax begins to play out with Mitchum on the boat in the center of the action, while Price in comic style gathers his rag-tag militia. A rare mix of suspense and humor.

1341261,3,B00004R75V,"Filmed by RKO during its period of ownership by Howard Hughes, HIS KIND OF WOMAN exists - as many films did - to show off the twin talents of Jane Russell.  Never a great actress, she nonetheless commands attention in a series of revealing costumes, and even gets to sing a couple of songs (albeit unmemorably).  Set in a relentlessly studio-bound Mexico, with stock footage to set the scenes, John Farrow's thriller centers on a professional gambler Dan Miner (Robert Mitchum), who becomes involved in a film noir-esque plot involving money, sex and illegality.  The plot negotiates its usual twists and turns, with Mitchum fulfilling his familiar tough-guy role.  Even during his prime as an actor, he seldom deviated from this stereotypical role, even though he was extremely good at it.  This movie's stand-out performance comes from Vincent Price as a smarmy socialite, the kind of person in whom one would never place one's trust.  He towers over Mitchum - which is no mean feat - but we know that he will never be a match for the star in a fist-fight.  In terms of line-delivery, the two actors couldn't be more different: Mitchum mumbles his lines through his teeth in familiar film noir style, while Price's dialogue is full of stresses and forced emphases - the kind of technique you'd expect from an old-style Shakespearean actor.  It's highly entertaining; and helps to explain why Price was one of Hollywood's most bankable supporting actors, even before he found belated stardom in Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe cycle in the early Sixties.",1400457600,,1554,4.9272030651340994
1341262,4,B00004R75V,"Note that this film is available as part of a five-picture Film Noir package, for about the same price as the film by itself.

It's one of the oddest noirs ever, starting with a down-on-his-luck professional gambler taking a $5K down-payment to do ""something"" he'll be told about later, and ending as... ""The Pirates of Penzance"" (with Frederick about to be terminated)? Really. I'm not kidding.

The complaint that the first hour (heck, most of the film) is confusing, holds some water. But plenty of hints are dropped, if you're paying attention. The climax has Vincent Price, as Mark Cardigan (!), a Flynn-like actor at the end of his career, leading a posse of Mexican police to save Mitchum.

This genre mixing doesn't work well, not so much because of the disparity, but because Price's scenes run on much too long. This weakens the film's tension, when it could have been used to heighten it. They could easily have been trimmed.

Mitchum is repeatedly beaten up, though mostly off-camera. But one beating has to be one of the worst, if not /the/ worst, beatings in a Code film.

Good performances all around, including the often-flat Jane Russell, and especially Price. Price is still in the ""serious actor"" part of his career, and avoids going overboard. (If you'd like an even better example of his comedic skills, catch ""Champagne for Caesar"".) Burr is surprisingly thin, and handsome.

Another Mitchum-Russell movie, yes, but the best is supporting cast. VINCENT PRICE in one of the funniest roles I have seen him play: a REAL actor on vacation (sans wife) so he can do some hunting. He meets up with Mitchum, and together they agree to go out together. There are other good actors, (Jim Backus, Tim Holt), etc. in the movie which makes it better. I won't tell the ""plot"" why Mitchum is there, or those people (in a resort in MX), but one night they ""enjoy"" a movie with Price in it. Doesn't go over well, except to those who are ""Star struck"".
Russell is ""playing"" up to Price, not knowing he is married, and neither know his wife is on her way down!
There are two funny memorable scenes: One is Mitchum ironing money: if none, he irons clothes. I met a man in his late 70's in line at the bank, and we got to talking about old movies, and when I told him I liked MITCHUM, he said ""I can remember him in a movie where he is ironing money"". (So, evidently it was a scene which made an impact, even to someone who remembers it from back when!).
The other, and best, moment is leading up to and the ending. The lead up to it is where PRICE really turns on the fun! While Mitchum and Russell are walking on the beach (since ""the wife"" has unexpectedly arrived), the situation Mitchum suddenly realizes hs is in & can forsee is going to be a problem. HE tells Russell to get PRICE and his guns. While on an escapade to ""Capture"" the bad guys, PRICE starts, then leads a group of police, etc. to where he is, having to shoot some of the bad guys along the way.

1341272,4,B00004R75V,"Just when you think a guy, in this case a Robert Mitchum 1950s crime noir movie actor guy, hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain when some vampish femme fatale displays her charms he finally gets some sense, a little anyway.  Previously I had the following to say about Brother Mitchum in a review of Angel Face (co-starring young femme fatale Jean Simmons):

Some guys never learn, never learn to leave well enough alone, and stay away, far away from femme fatales that have that slightly mad look in their eyes and lust in their hearts, as here in the Otto Preminger-directed <em>crime noir</em>, Angel Face, with Robert Mitchum. See, it is not like Brother Robert hadn't been down that road before and had all the trouble he could handle and then some with femme fatale Jane Greer in Out Of The Past. Ms. Greer ""took him for a ride"" six ways to Sunday in that one. But you know when a guy gets heated up by a dame, well, let's just leave it at you know, okay. Needless to say Brother Robert is set to get ""taken for a ride"" six ways to Sunday here too, although the femme fatale here is a little younger, and maybe has better manners than Ms. Greer. Maybe. But that all goes for naught when the heat rises. Yes, we guys  and maybe gals too) know, we know, nature.""

And a summary of the plot in the comedic crime noir under review here, His Kind Of Woman, will tell the tale of why I qualified that wising up a little part. Mitchum plays a profession gambler a little off his game, about six aces up the sleeve worth, and so, as anybody is that situation might do, he listens to any proposition that will get him out from under. In this case a proposition about changing his identity for a wad of dough from a deported gangster (played by a non-lawyerly, a very non-lawyerly, Raymond Burr), looking to get back in the old U.S. of A. so he can get his usual infusion of illegal dough. Now this is something that Mitchum might have passed on in sunnier times. But times are hard and suckers are not as plentiful to rope in when you don't have dough, or a way to get it.

Of course the action here, due to Burr's, ah, immigration problems, has to take place in, well, sunny Mexico (this is stage-door Mexico before the ax fell down there and crime, and criminals got nastier, very much nastier than that of the criminal skills displayed here) at a tropical seaside resort (naturally). And here is where the dame comes in, also naturally. A sweet-singing down-on-her-heels night club singer (maybe) posing as an heiress,  played by Jane Russell (producer Howard Hughes' paramour at the time), is working her own angles for dough in the person of a vacationing ham, strictly B-movie actor, played by Vincent Price. But when broad-shouldered, bedroom eyes, world-wary Mitchum shows up she is, he is, well, they are smitten (after a little cat and mouse game, as expected). When Mitchum, after putting together some acute observations (putting two and two together, okay) about the set-up, fully realized that he is to be the fall guy and may not get to spend that promised wad of dough everything goes awry.  But get this- when things get hairy Ms. Russell, instead of throwing him to the wolves like some of his past companions, actually tries to help him (trying to provide a gat in the bargain). A lot.

Now Robert this is a woman to hang onto, and she looks, well, fetching in a bathing suit in the bargain. Speaking of which, while he is trying to bring a little justice in this old wicked old world Mitchum shows plenty of beefcake for the ladies, the 1950s ladies I would guess. Plenty of comic moments here, some corny some clever but the main thing is that Brother Mitchum does not have to keep looking over his shoulder every time he kisses Ms. Russell like with some of that  earlier female company he kept. Whee!

Note: Naturally with a hunky guy like Robert Mitchum, he of the broad shoulders to fend off the world's troubles, or at least any women's troubles, those smoldering eyes, and that glib world-wary cigarette and whiskey manner, the ladies will surely be flocking to his door.  Sorry, in this one heart-of- gold faux gold-digger Russell has him slated as exclusive property.  And Mitchum tries, tries like hell, for once to stay in that orbit, unlike in the past, where he let those maddened femme fatale eyes and ruby red lips that speak to some dark adventure get the best of him. Progress, definitely progress,  Brother Mitchum.",1317513600,,4464,4.530434782608696
1341273,3,B00004R75V,"A screenwriting disaster with lots and lots of appealing bits in it. Jane Russell is terrific. And the movie has Thurston Howell the Third, Vincent Price, AND Perry Mason--who couldn't love that? The cinematography goes from very good (well, maybe just good in the shootout scenes) to very, very good. Robert Mitchum has lots of great lines (She: ""I heard you killed --------. How did it feel?"" Mitchum: ""He didn't say."") But oh my god, the idiotic plot. The movie can't begin to decide what genre it is--it goes from film noir to suave romance to slapstick comedy (I mean really, the BOAT SINKS?) to over-the-top melodrama complete with mad bug-eyed pure-evil arch-villain and neo-Nazi-ish doctor. And what is that weird freaky business with the belt? Just a whack-O mess.

To begin with, the movie goes for practically an HOUR without the audience knowing what the heck is going on; and when you finally learn, you'll wish you'd stayed in the dark. With a plot this hopeless, you'd want to put off getting to it for as long as possible too.

According to the commentary by Vivian Sobchack (I like DVDs with commentary tracks), the notorious nutjob billionaire Howard Hughes had purchased RKO Radio Pictures in 1948, and immediately began ""helping"" with the studio's products, including this 1951 release. She says he was responsible for most of the bad parts of this movie-that-can't-make-up-its-mind: apparently he was virtually writing the film himself by the time it turns weird and genre-bending. So this is really a textbook example of how a meddlesome boss can ruin a project...except that apparently the meddlesome (and inexplicably inconsistent) censors helped spoil the broth too.

I can't even complain that it's not a ""film noir"" because it is. But only in places.

There are holes galore in the plot--not only is the main plot straight out of a comic book, but there are all sorts of little ""asides"" that don't advance the story. And although it's hard to dislike Robert Mitchum in anything, he never conveys the sense here that he's ever actually in any danger OR that he is but doesn't care (like in ""Out of the Past""). But that's beside the point--it's the genre-confusion that spoils the stew here, like a whole bunch of standard Hollywood tropes tossed in randomly and stirred. Where did that term ""hot mess"" come from? It's perfect for ""His Kind of Woman!"".

I can't quite bring myself to give this two stars because of the lovely Jane Russell and the great B&W camerawork and...well, all the swell Hollywood pros doing such swell jobs at what they do. But three stars is really a stretch for a movie that just plain fails to come together.",1308355200,4,2660,4.850220264317181

1341275,4,B00004R75V,"This is a review for HIS KIND OF WOMAN (1951) dby John Farrow (w/Richard Fleischer), Production Supervised by Howard Hughes.
HIS KIND OF WOMAN was probably made, remade and made again before producer Howard Hughes came close to being satisfied with it. It's really not GONE WITH THE WIND but you would think that's what was being filmed considering all the time, care and especially money that was put into it.

As it is, HIS KIND OF WOMAN is more or less two movies in one, the first two thirds, a more or less straight ahead film noir directed by John Farrow, and the last  third which was directed by, among others, Richard Fleischer.  The first portion features plenty of the noir touches that we've become used to from the likes of RKO and Robert Mitchum,  shadowy threats of violence and thanks to John Farrow, plenty of fairly ingenious long takes that help keep the story momentum going without a lot of jarring back and forth then he said, then she said set up shots. The final third, when Vincent Price becomes more prominent in the story, is more like a farcial adition to the first part, and the longer the story goes, the funnier it becomes. Vincent Price is in top form in this film, at least the second part, and even if you don't care for moody noirs, you might like the anti-noir farcial atmosphere of the second part and climax of HIS KIND OF WOMAN.

The story of HIS KIND OF WOMAN concerns gambler Dan Milner, played by Robert Mitchum, being persueded to go to Baja, Mexico in order to assist a Luciano-like gangster, played by Raymond Burr, to re-enter the United States without government permission. Along the way Milner runs into a singer named Lenore Brent, played by Jane Russell and a popular Errol Flynn-like movie actor played by Vincent Price.

Although at times HIS KIND OF WOMAN can get a mite congested, there's a lot of activity and plenty of interesting characters to keep things going and the two hour running time is pleasantly filled with the type of entertainment we have come to expect from the later years of the RKO studio.

I rate HIS KIND OF WOMAN Four Stars",1284508800,3,2101,4.571808510638298
1341276,4,B00004R75V,"This one gets 'thumbs way up' from me, but not knowing the plot (IMO) increases the fun; as the type of 'fun' is best when unexpected.  Still, if you don't care either way: ""Read on MacDuff!""

***SPOILERS***

This is one fun movie, especially if you are going in expecting a straight crime film.  But Howard Hughes, in his attempt to resurrect RKO, had other ideas....

At the crux of the plot is deported Italian gangster Nick Ferraro (a rather thin Raymond Burr).  Ferraro's men lure Dan Milner (Robert Mitchum), a down-on-his-luck gambler, down to Mexico with the promise of $50,000.  Milner has no idea what for, but he is paid a portion in advance, and that is good enough for him.  What Milner doesn't know is that Ferraro plans to kill him in Mexico, and impersonate him across the border, into the states.

On his way down to Mexico, Mitchum meets Lenore Brent (Jane Russell) and immediately falls for her.  They are both destined for the same resort, but Milner soon learns that Brent is trying to land married actor Mark Cardigan (Vincent Price).  Cardigan is a successful thespian, but his marriage is a poor one, so he has come down to Mexico to take out his frustrations by hunting ... and meeting up with Brent.

We are introduced to a myriad of resort patrons, such as Myron Winton (Jim Backus), 'our narrator' Thompson (Charles McGraw), chess-playing writer Martin Krafft (John Mylong), and about midway, Bill Lusk (Tim Holt).  Up until this point, everything is rather noiry and mysterious in tone; especially after warning Milner something is up ... Lusk ends up dead.

Then the tone shifts to something akin to a mix of James Bond and Errol Flynn swashbuckler, as the thugs fail to take Milner aboard a boat to his ultimate doom.  They fail because Cardigan is warned about what is going on, and he helps Milner by coming to the rescue fully armed.

But then Milner gets the idea that the only way to put a stop to all this is to confront Ferraro on his boat, which is manned by about 20-25 sailors and gangsters....  So he attempts to board the boat and find Ferraro.
By this time, Cardigan (in what is one of the most fun performances I've ever seen Price give) feels the rush of adventure and collects a rag-tag band to storm the boat, all the while spouting Shakespearean quotes and wry quips.  The last quarter of the film is, in my opinion, as funny as any screwball comedy you care to name.

Mark Cardigan:  ""Alas, why must I be plagued by yammering magpies on the eve of battle?!""

Fun film.",1284076800,,2518,4.575892857142857
1341277,5,B00004R75V,"I'm not usually a big fan of the film noir genre - I enjoy some of the old Humphrey Bogart movies (yes, I'm in my 20s but I like old movies) like ""Casablanca"" and ""To Have and Have Not"", but that's about as close as I get.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, however.  It was a very well-written, intelligent film with good performers.  One of the best parts about this movie was the tongue-in-cheek banter between Robert Mitchum and Jane Russell.  Raymond Burr did an outstanding job, as well - he made himself one of those villains you just love to hate.  I'm not sure how this movie avoided becoming a huge classic; it's a thriller with plenty of action and suspense, but it's also a hidden comedy gem.

The beginning of the film was good and kept my attention, but it went from ""good"" to ""excellent"" as soon as Vincent Price came on the scene.  The man was an absolute riot in this film.  He plays an over-the-top actor who is going through a midlife crisis; between his exaggerated personality and his quoting of Shakespeare, his hilarious antics had me laughing so hard I nearly cried.  Price's performance was a great way to add levity to a suspense film.  Although it can be truly said that Vincent Price ""steals the show"" in this film, that should not detract Robert Mitchum fans; his character is more serious but still has a lighter side.  One important thing to consider when deciding whether or not to buy is that even though this movie could definitely be considered a comedy, it is still a serious and suspenseful film noir thriller.",1279843200,,1545,4.541516245487364
1341278,4,B00004R75V,"Produced by Howard Hughes, His Kind of Woman! is a blending of a little bit from several genres, including film noir, over-the-top comedy, and action.  Surprisingly enough, it all works really well.  Dan Milner is typically a gambler who has everything go his way, but of late he's hit an unlucky streak.  When he's at his lowest, Milner is approached by some shady characters with a way to make some easy money.  All he has to do is go to a remote Mexican resort and wait to meet a man. Arriving at the resort, Milner starts to smell a rat as the plan comes together, a deported mobster wants to buy his identity so he can get back into the US.  Of course that's just the basic storyline.  There's a wide variety of crazy, eccentric characters at the resort all with their own motives.  The blending of noir, action, and comedy works perfectly together and makes for a very enjoyable movie.

  Leading the ensemble cast is the always cool Robert Mitchum as Dan Milner, a down and out gambler looking for some easy money.  Mitchum could pull off action star and romance equally well which serves him well here.  He teams with sex symbol Jane Russell for their first of two movies together.  Russell plays Lenore Brent, a heiress looking to nab a rich husband. Her scenes with Mitchum are great, and her character is basically a chance to show off her good looks in any number of outfits.  Vincent Price really seems to be enjoying himself as over-the-top Mark Cardigan, a Hollywood actor who jumps at the chance to get into some real action when trouble arises.  The solid supporting cast includes Tim Holt, Charles McGraw, Marjorie Reynolds, Raymond Burr, Jim Backus, Leslie Banning, and Philip Van Zandt.

 The DVD has the movie in a standard presentation with a few scratches here and there, but nothing that takes you away from the movie.  Film historian Vivian Sobchack also provides an informative commentary, but that's it for special features.  So for a movie that blends action, comedy and noir with great performances from Mitchum, Russell, and Price, check out His Kind of Woman!",1226534400,3,2090,4.707988980716253
