1443293,2,B00005JKZ0,"""Mean Machine"" was a predictable and less than appealing movie. The movie had bursts of humor here and there (e.g. commentators Bob and Bob during the final game, Jason Statham as ""The Monk""), and the soundtrack, probably its only saving grace, was quite good...
The DVD is NOT worth the price tag because of the lack of special features. Granted, the British slangs were a bit confusing and the alternate ""U.S. Release"" featured on the DVD was helpful. But, one could easily turn on the captions while watching the ""Theatrical Release"" and not miss a word.
Rent the move if you want to watch it and save your money for the soundtrack.",1033344000,,635,4.678571428571429
1443294,2,B00005JKZ0,"This entire movie, including the title, were ""borrowed"" from an earlier piece, as were dialogue, settings and plot. If you have seen or see now, ""The Longest Yard"" starring Burt Reynolds, you will see for yourself how much of TLY was scavenged to produce this flagrant rip-off. Tracy Keenan Wynn conceived and wrote the original, TLY, and should have had screen credit for this, except for the fact that it pales in comparison, and as such, is probably better left attributed to the ""borrowers."" No honor among thieves, even in Hollywood, or should I say, ESPECIALLY in Hollywood. See ""The Longest Yard"" instead, a much better film, and ORIGINAL.",1032393600,,646,4.935779816513762
1443295,4,B00005JKZ0,"Matthew Vaughn and Guy Ritchie team up again to produce another story from the underside of British culture, with Barry Skolnick as director.  This time they take various members of the casts of previous movies Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch into the British prison system of screws (guards) and cons (prisoners).  Jason Statham plays the insane ""Monk"" with a nice set of abs, Vas Blackwood (LS2SB's malicious Rory Breaker) gives us a softer side of himself as ""Massive.""
Vinny Jones, himself the bad boy of British soccer, plays Danny Meehan, ex-England soccer captain who is imprisoned for drunken assault.  Once inside, Danny comes face to face with disappointed fans and a crooked prison warden who puts the pressure on to make Danny coach the prison football team.  Upon the advice of his fellow convict, ""it's ironic"" Massive, Meehan suggests a match between the guards and the convicts as a way to keep everyone off his back.  The recruiting and training of his team take Danny Meehan, the Mean Machine, through some rough spots, but eventually he regains his respect for both the game and himself during the climactic match.
Unlike LS2SB and Snatch, this movie doesn't come with a second DVD full of the interesting ""other stuff"" that consumers are starting to take for granted.  I admit I was disappointed too.  Instead, Mean Machine comes in two versions: the original UK version, for which you will need to know the lingo of ""birds"" and ""nippers"" and ""taking a pony;"" or the ""domestic"" US version, in which some of the more elusive British slang is dubbed, kung-fu b-movie style, with more easily understood words.  Take your pick.
Remakes are rarely as magnificent as the originals and I don't understand why film creators with proven talent and creativity decided to do this story as a British version of 1974's The Longest Mile.  It could have stood on it's own two feet on the soccer pitch without being based on something else.
Instead of comparing it to another movie about a different country and different sport, take Mean Machine for what it is - a rough and tough British comedy that will give you an excellent evening's worth of entertainment.",1031356800,,2182,4.875675675675676
1443296,1,B00005JKZ0,"Mean Machine is an absolutely awesome movie. It's funny and entertaining in its own right, but for a soccer fan it's got so much added value, with both realistic and out-of-whack soccer moves galore.

Who the (..) do they take us for?? Not even a trailer. And there could have been so many cool things, like out-takes and the actors practicing their soccer moves...
And how much do they want for this absolutely bare DVD?(....)! At a time when the feature-packed Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition DVD is available for a lower price, that's a bit much.

  A basic storyline is: After a great life in international soccer, a man is arrested and sent to prison. The warden of the prison is a huge football fan and thus the delima begins for the inmate. Freedom or Soccer?

Watching Vinnie Jones go from tough guy to some almost spinless chump is difficult to swallow, Stathams character is a joke and the guards are pathetic. It was really nice to see so many of the same faces from Lock Stock and Snatch but honestly, this movie is a joke, the characters have no background so you don't identify with any of them, they are just thrown at you and you have to accept it. The relationships on screen are just as forced so they are equally hard to swallow. The whole thing feels like someone laid out how The Longest Yard was built, then they just cut and pasted everything.

1443426,2,B00005JKZ0,"The original ""The Longest Yard"" and the lame Adam Sandler remake are better than ""Mean Machine"".  So is ""Bend It Like Beckham"" and ""Kicking and Screaming"".  Vinnie Jones made an auspicious debut in a bit part as a debt collector in ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"".  Asked to shoulder the heft of a starring role Jones just doesn't have the acting heft.  His co-stars in director Guy Ritchie's debut film(Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, and Vas Blackwood)run circles around him in this vehicle.  Truth be told soccer holds as much interest to me as grass growing.  That said I'm not a hockey fan but I loved ""Slapshot"".  Regardless, the most indelible thing on display here is David Hemings' pointy eyebrows.  The European title for this film was ""The Mean Machine"".

1443461,3,B00005JKZ0,"I turned Adam Sandler's remake of ""The Longest Yard"" off after twenty minutes, vowing only to watch it again when the world's collided.  I have never seen Burt Reynold's original ""Longest Yard"", though I have just added it to the films that I am eagerly awaiting to see - so with that said, I went way beyond my typical style of cinema viewing and chose to watch ""Mean Machine"" first and foremost.  Obviously I didn't read the reviews close enough to know that it is simply a remake of Reynold's work, so I went in blindly ... very blindly.  This is probably one of the only times that I will watch a film out of sequential order (i.e. what was meant to be released first and second), but I am extremely happy with my decision.  ""Mean Machine"" was a crisp, ""thud""-packed film that didn't fight with clichs, but instead gave us an action-comedy that only the British can conquer.  While most will complain that this film doesn't do justice to the original, I must ask if Sandler's did either?  ""The Longest Yard"" wasn't a groundbreaking piece of cinema, and to see a British team remake the film, it is almost like a smile on our American faces.  How often does that happen?  So, without seeing much of the other two films, I went into ""Mean Machine"" with a clean slate, and enjoyed every moment of it.  This was a fresh film, commercial in every since of the word, but fresh for what we decided to remake and slaughter.

I hate sports films.  With this film I thought I would watch and return, without giving it a second thought.  I thought it would be another clich moment of the underdogs beating out at the last moment without anyone skipping a beat and winning the female lead at the end.  We have all seen these before, and it is the clich ride that most sports films seem to fall.  While ""Mean Machine"" was similar in nature, what lead to those final moments was really what transformed this film to above average.  Vinnie Jones is tolerable.  Actually, he is better in this film and shows more range with ""Mean Machine"" than I have seen him grapple in years.  Sure, he was fun in the Guy Ritchie films, but it was fun to see him play the lead this time, while Jason Statham played the muscle.  I loved, and in fact love his body of work, David Kelly.  He was phenomenal as the older mentor in this film.  What made ""Mean Machine"" stand out was the cast, the trouble I had with Sandler's film was that everyone was fighting to get the best joke in, everyone wanted to be in a scene with Sandler or Rock, but in this one, everyone had their own voice and logic.  There were actual characters in this film, ones that stood beyond themselves and created the world we were viewing.  With any sports film, there is that inconsistency that could transform the film into a very flat picture.  That was never the case here.  Jones and his crew gave us direction from point A to point B without missing a beat.  Doc, Burton, Massive, Monk, Ratchett, and Sykes brought the prison alive and made us root for a game we have nearly disregarded in America.

The weakest part of this film had to be the story.  While the characters gave the story a voice as well as characters to root for, there was just something lacking with the story.  It was strong, much stronger than most sports films of the same nature, but there was just that level of punch missing that you would expect from any typical British film.  The direction may have had something to do with it, but not completely.  I can't put my finger on the issue, and I think it has to do with the ability to recycle films - there is always something missing from each carbon copy.  I need to see the original, but alone, ""Mean Machine"" was directed eagerly, but lacked the depth in the story.  I wanted to see Danny's downfall in the beginning, I wanted to know more about him prior to his jail time, the idea of him fixing games seemed minimal in the overall scope of what Danny had to do with playing the guards.  I needed that knowledge of whom he was and the struggles that he was facing.  Sure, it wasn't meant to be this grand bio-pic, but something (as short as it was needed) had to be there.  Maybe I am pulling at straws, but as I look at this picture as a whole, it was a stand-alone film that prided laughs (intelligent ones) as well as hard hitting action, but it needed something more.  I could watch this film again, and I would go through the motions, but something was missing.  It was like having the best piece of pie in the county, but realizing later that a scoop of ice cream would have been nice as a side.  Unknown director Barry Skolnick places this film together well, but I feel as if he could have done more.  I didn't need another ""Lock, Stock"", but I needed something that grabbed me further into.

Will I buy this film?  Yep, I think I will just because I loathe the 20-minutes of the Sandler version and prefer to give others a taste of what decent remakes are like, but I cannot say that it is the best film watched.  My review seems scattered at best, and as I read through it again, I don't think I have quite the grasp on this film as I hoped.  I liked it, not loved it, and I could watch it again, but not too often.  Bubbles have more consistency than I do with ""Mean Machine"".  Maybe it was Charlie Fletcher's screenplay, but honestly I think I am just grabbing at air.  I think what could have toppled me with this film would have been some special features.  Something to show me how it was made, an audio commentary to give me a voice for the director, something that would have made me look deeper into this film.  ""Mean Machine"" isn't bland, but I needed a better flavor.

Overall, I liked it.  I am growing tired of this review and think it will throw others off the trail of this invitingly fresh film, so I am going to stop.  I think everyone should watch this.  Sure, it doesn't have the bathroom humor of Sandler's version, but it does provide the Brits an opportunity to demonstrate that their ""football"" is just as exciting as ours.

1443466,4,B00005JKZ0,"The formula is familiar but enjoyable. A group of British tough guys are assembled for an enterprise that combines violence with humor, while cherishing their peculiar personalities and even finding goodness where none should grow. We've had prisoners winning a gardening competition, pot dealers helping little old ladies, and crooks leaving crime for life as real estate agents. Now here is ""Mean Machine,"" about a corrupt British soccer champion, jailed for rigging an important match, and ordered by the prison governor to coach the inmates' team. The big match will be against the guards' team.

If this premise rings a faint, far-off bell, you may be remembering Robert Aldrich's ""The Longest Yard"" (1974), with one of Burt Reynolds' best performances, that told the same story, more or less, in terms of American football. Barry Skolnick's ""Mean Machine"" is more than inspired by ""The Longest Yard;"" it's based on the same Tracy Keenan Wynn screenplay, and indeed ""Mean Machine"" was even the original title of ""The Longest Yard."" The movie stars Vinnie Jones, a real-life footballer so tough he didn't even play for England, he played for Wales. He was known for dirty football, just like Danny Meehan, his character in the film. You may recognize Jones' Fearless Fosdick features from ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" directed by Guy Ritchie, who produced this film. And he has appeared as a fearsome background presence in ""Snatch,"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Swordfish."" In his first lead role, he handles the dialogue like meat and potatoes, one line at a time, chewed carefully.

The deal: The prison governor (David Hemmings) has a gambling problem, and is crazy about football. He orders his new celebrity prisoner to coach the team. This does not sit well with the head guard, who coaches the guards' team, but what can he say? Danny doesn't much want to enter the coaching profession, but the governor makes him a threat he can't ignore.

The most enjoyable passages are some of the most predictable, recycled out of countless other movies where a leader has to pick his men. Danny finds himself with the prison contraband retailer, Massive (Vas Blackwood), as his right-hand man, and a violent, feared con named Monk (Jason Statham) as his star player. He gets a lot of valuable prison lore and advice from the ancient convict Doc (David Kelly, who you will remember from his naked scooter ride in ""Waking Ned Devine""). Kelly has had a whole late flowering while playing twinkly geezers, clouded only by the distressing tendency of his characters to end up in sentimental death scenes.

All leads up to the big match, which of course involves hard play and dirty tricks, and dovetails neatly with the governor's gambling problem. ""Mean Machine"" lacks the social satire of ""The Longest Yard,"" which was a true early 1970s film and therefore anti-establishment. ""Mean Machine"" is only interested in the characters and the game. Guy Ritchie, who started out as such an innovator in ""Lock, Stock, etc.,"" seems to have headed directly for reliable generic conventions as a producer. But they are reliable, and have become conventions for a reason: They work. ""Mean Machine"" is what it is, and very nicely, too.",1138665600,2,3227,5.003724394785848

I had seen the original, but I did prefer this version, Vinnie Jones was very good I thought and it is a film that I could definitely watch again.  Worth seeing, whether you have viewed the original or not.",1042934400,2,305,4.135593220338983
1443513,4,B00005JKZ0,"I love the Longest Yard, and the Mean Machine is a cute remake.  The final game is well shot with great music. Very predictable, but exactly what you want in a film-Lots fun. The prison game announcers are a riot.
I liked the nice touch with the winning goal.",1040688000,,259,4.285714285714286
1443514,5,B00005JKZ0,This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I watched it probably 10 times when i rented it and fell in love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who liked Snatch and Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.,1037750400,,219,4.0
1443515,3,B00005JKZ0,"Vinnie Jones is Danny ""Mean Machine"" Meehan, former star soccer player, who was once hired to promote the sports goods of first-rate company Umbro.  But now drunk and disgraced, he is in jail, doing his time of three-year sentence.  But the governor there, himself deep in debt, wants him to go back to the game (between wards and prisoners), AND lose it on purpose, just like Danny did in the international match between England and Germany.
Sounds familiar?  Sure, the film's opening credits show that ""Mean Machine"" is actually based on Burt Reynolds's film ""The Longest Yard.""  You may say, or groan, ""Not again!,"" but be assured, this new one is surprisingly good, considering that Vinnie Jones's career as actor has just got started.  And his fans, be proud; though he may not be nominated for BAFTA awards, his turn as the first-time lead is really good, and convincing.
The virtue of ""Mean Machine"" is that the film looks very authentic.  That's no surprise, you say, because Vinnie Jones was a professional soccer player, but keep in mind that he had to shape up his body again to fit in the role as it has been pretty long since he had retired.  As I'm a huge soccer fan, and watch Euporean games live on cable TV in Japan, I can tell you this, but the players of ""Mean Machine"" team are good at playing soccer, and the most remarkable thing is that they play so well  that their movements in the game is authentic (except for the goal keeper, who likes keep the ball too much), and look very real, if not as good as those you see in English Premier games.  On top of that, most scenes are shot in real prison, The Oxford Prison, now disused for years.
But the greatest find is Vinnie Jones, who is natural and sometimes even humorous.  He is much better than ill-used role in ""Swordfish,"" and the director knows how to use his tough-guy persona on the screen.  The film keeps a good speed, and the supports are also effective, such as veteran actor David Kelly (""Greenfingers,"" another prison drama, and ""Waking Ned Divine"").  And for the soccer fans (and players), Vinnie's lecture on ""How to Commit Foul Plays"" is very funny, alarmingly.
Overall the film is a drama, and some of the scenes are very serious, but the film doens't stop there too long.  Predictable you may call it, but I still find it fun to watch.  You may too, especially when you like soccer like me.",1034899200,8,2381,4.55868544600939
