8170813,4,B000MQ554I,"For record album collectors of a certain age, the first thing that may come to mind when glancing over the list of performers on CUTTING EDGE COMEDIANS OF THE 60'S AND 70'S just might be all the fondly remembered labels these folks appeared on. There were a few companies, like VERVE, MERCURY, WARNER BROS. and EPIC, that were ""humor-friendly,"" and others, such as LITTLE DAVID, which were created specifically --for-- comedians.

It's true that these video clips aren't ""adult-only"" rated, so don't expect George Carlin's ""Seven Words"" routine, or Richard Pryor in all his profane glory. Source material is the broadcast TV that existed long before cable made dissemination of 'R' rated stuff feasible. Fans of good, clean humor won't be disappointed however, nor will anyone seeking to reminisce about the simpler times-- when you could turn on a talk show or play a comedy album and not have to worry whether the kids might hear.

8170814,2,B000MQ554I,"When I read about this DVD on Amazon I thought it would be a great compilation of some of the greatest comedians of yesteryear.  Maybe I expected too much from clips that were made in the sixties and seventies, when broadcast regulations bolstered censorship rulings.  George Carlin and Richard Pryor in particular, appeared bland and flat.

I guess for me the interesting thing about this DVD was witnessing the transformation some of today's most raucous and rebellious comedians made.  Still, overall I was disappointed.",1182816000,4,523,5.190476190476191
8170815,1,B000MQ554I,"Cutting edge comedians, without their cutting edge material.  What a letdown... only the safest routines, with completely inane commentary (""One thing is certain.  We all like to laugh.""  How profound.)

Don't waste your money.",1182038400,5,227,5.588235294117647
8170816,5,B000MQ554I,"What a fascinating ""lineup"" spanning decades of standup! Great fun to see some of the early standup work of Newhart, Sahl, Cambridge, etc. And the early-and-later appearances of Carlin and Pryor are nothing short of astonishing. They start as clean-cut, fairly conventional comics in suit and tie, then, when they let their hair down (literally), it's like they've become entirely different people. Never saw a lot of the color appearances with Andy Kaufman and Lily Tomlin. Very cool. Bonus of commercials with comedians is fun, too.",1176163200,8,534,5.22093023255814
