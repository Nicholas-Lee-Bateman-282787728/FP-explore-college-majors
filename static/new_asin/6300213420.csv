7805394,5,6300213420,"Kirk, Spock, and some others beam down to a planet lush with plant life. They notice someone following them and find a way to surprise this person. Kirk punches him and the guy say's ""You struck me... with your hand."" He never heard of such a thing before. And he has antennas sticking out of his head. That's how he communicates with Vaul, the God of the planet.

Then they are taken to the village on this planet. The villagers are in great shape physically but have child like innocence.

This show has great dialog. Especially the part when Spock explains about reproduction on the planet to the young lady from the Enterprise. This is a great show. Star Trek fans won't want to miss out on this one.",1286582400,,704,4.449612403100775
7805395,1,6300213420,"This episode is one of the Second Season's worst. First, you have red shirt guys dropping like flies left and right. It was this episode that gave the idea that if you wore a red shirt, you were dead. You then have the stupid Vaal computer. Question: If Vaal could control lightening, then couldn't he have killed everyone? He did not need to teach the people how to kill. The crew responded by not feeding him. Question: If Vaal could drag down a might starship, couldn't he have dragged some fruits off the trees and into his ""mouth""? When Scotty couldn't pull away because of Vaal's tractor beam, what does Kirk do? He fires him. This episode is bad!",1242259200,2,653,4.495798319327731
7805396,4,6300213420,"One of the troublesome situations Star Trek created when it originally aired was it's human centric attitude towards the alien societies it encountered.  The prime directive seemed of little importance to Kirk; he quite often got very involved in the alien cultures `straightening matters out' or setting a culture on the right course'.  Spock and McCoy would invariably have a heated debate about the virtues they have observed within the alien culture, which would regularly lead to a final moralistic and ethic punctuated passionate closing discourse by Kirk who then decides the course of proper events to follow.
But in `The Apple' we find that the prime directive doesn't apply. The Enterprise is assigned to investigate a planet by the Federation who had received reports of `odd readings' from another vessel earlier. Though the planet is idyllic in appearance there are unseen and unpredictable dangers. The away team discovers plants that shoot poisonous darts, rocks that explode if stepped on or tossed and lightening storms that can target with amazing accuracy. The present alien culture behaves like tranquil children who exist solely to appease a computer that grants all their needs.  This initiates an intriguing debate between Kirk, Spock and McCoy with Spock reminding the good doctor ""that humans are a small minority in the galaxy.""  A good point considering the assembled universe that Star Trek creates!
The reason that the prime directive wouldn't apply to this situation is this: There really is no thriving culture on the planet.  The sophisticated computer, known as Vaal, has successfully eliminated disease, extended the life of the humanoids indefinitely, controls the weather, etc.  The aliens have no need and therefore no desire to grow beyond what they consider to be normal.  By definition then this is a stagnant and arrested development of humanoids that no one would classify as viable.  If the Enterprise were to allow them to remain that way it is quite possible that another superior race of aliens could exploit this situation if they were to come to the planet as the Federation did.  So in this instance Kirk does the right thing by effectively  `pulling the plug' on Vaal.
Overall a well-conceived and highly imaginative episode - though some questions that don't get answered hurt some of the impact here.  For instance how and why did Vaal come into being?  Who could have built such a computer to completely control humanoids?  Who or what installed the antennae on Akuta?  There is no summary provided that might hint at an explanation, it is simply ignored and that is frustrating.  One thing I noted about Vaal during the episode was his tendency toward masculine thought.  Though the men and women are equal on levels of society there are a couple of noteworthy items.  He selected a male, Akuta, to be the leader.  This alone is not very significant but when Vaal instructs him to kill the `infestation' only the men are present - the women are not even in sight for this event, though the Enterprise away team has a female with them.
Some final notes: Spock takes quite a beating here!  He gets struck down by poisonous darts; tossed considerably backward by a force field; still later he gets struck by lightening.  Also, four security guards are eliminated by Vaal during the away mission - definitely not a good day for Enterprise Security.  The actress playing Lt. Martha Landon, Celeste Yarnall, is one of the loveliest female costars that Star Trek was fortunate to get during it's series run in the sixties.  She can also be spotted as the cover girl on Tom Lisanti's book `Fantasy Femmes Of The Sixties Cinema' - it is quite a fetching photograph!",1038355200,,3710,4.96925566343042
