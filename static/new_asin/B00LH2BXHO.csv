8665814,5,B00LH2BXHO,"I enjoyed this kdrama - the plot and the acting were good.  Surprised it's the same actress as in Boys Over Flowers drama.  I've added this drama to my DVD collection.  If no USA version, I normally purchase the Singapore version.  I rent from the public library and match the sku with the online purchase so I know what quality I am getting for both picture and english translation.",1463875200,,383,4.507246376811594

8665816,5,B00LH2BXHO,"Korean television drama often revolves around one or two themes: the social gaps separating two lovers or the psychic pains afflicting them. In ANGEL EYES, director Park Shin-woo deftly combines them in a twenty episode series that lays out the often twisting paths that the lovers must take. A pair of high schoolers meet and predictably fall in love. The male is Park Dong Joo. He is bright, decent, and hopes to study medicine.  The female is Yoon Soo-wan . She is also bright, decent, and quite blind. It would be difficult enough for both to succeed given the animus that her father has for Park Dong Joo. Melodrama enters when his mother is hit by a hit and run driver and she unbelievably is murdered in her hospital room.  Heart broken, Park Dong Joo heads for the United States and studies there.  Fast forward twelve years and they meet again. The plot includes various push-pull events that wrap them together even as these events tear them asunder.

  What becomes clear is that Director Park Shin-woo imbues all the major characters with a paralyzing angst that renders them unable to see clearly why they act the way they do.  Park Dong Joo has neither forgotten nor come to terms with the pain of losing his mother.  Yoon Soo-wan had bonded strongly with Park Dong Joo's mother and she suffers as well, more so in fact when twelve years later she learns that his mother had willed Yoon Soo-wan her eyes hence the significance of the title. Others wallow in never ending pain. Park Dong Joo's sister Park Hye-joo suffers for the same reason as her brother.  Yoo Soon-wan's father has his own grief and guilty conscience as we learn early on of his own role in the death of the mother of Park Dong Joo.  Then there is the policeman who was fired because he was getting too close to solving the death of Park Dong Joo's mother.  There are others who endure a long term corrosive angst, and the plot sets in motion a carefully calibrated dance of self-awareness that by the final episode gives resolution only to a very few. ANGEL EYES makes the telling point that pain for some is a cross that must be borne without hope of resolution while for others it is the driving motivation to stop it.",1439856000,,2204,4.568527918781726

8665818,1,B00LH2BXHO,I don't think this was a licensed product.  Just saw the another version recently listed on Amazon which looks more legit.  Why is there a black bar at the bottom of all the titles for the these new Korean dramas.  Just weird looking image that doesn't look legit in my opinion.  I will stick to buying versions produced by Poh Kim (PK) and PMP since I know these brands are licensed and I could trust in the quality of the licensed products.,1430784000,4,442,4.353658536585366
