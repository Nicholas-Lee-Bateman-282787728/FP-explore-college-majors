8416587,2,B0045A54VG,"I saw the trailer for this film on GodTube a few years ago -- and it looked ""really good"" until I had the opportunity to watch the entire film on a free movie website a few days ago.

In terms of the cinematic effort, the movie was lacking  -- the direction, editing, photography, scripting and acting could have used a lot of objective help.

However, even with its flaws,  this movie's effort to get across the message of God's grace in Christ is clear, hence the two-star rating.",1395532800,,482,4.443181818181818
8416588,5,B0045A54VG,"What can we learn from the lesson of Jesus' parable about a lost sheep? This movie gives us a glimpse of the heart of a true shepherd, and the joy of one member reunited with its lost members. Shepherds not only had to watch over their sheep by day and by night; they also had to protect them from wolves and lions that preyed upon them, and from dangerous terrain and storms. An isolated sheep can quickly become bewildered, disoriented, and even neurotic. Easy prey for wolves and lions and these movies captures this well.

Another take on the movie is to look at it in the lens of these three parables, the Lost Sheep, the Lost Coin and the prodigal son. In the first two parables the owner actively searches and finds what is missing and in the third parable, the father lets his son have his own way, but waits longingly for him to come home, then forgives him and celebrates. The common theme is repentance.",1379462400,,914,4.440476190476191
8416589,4,B0045A54VG,This is a great movie and a great effort for a first time effort by a church.  It is in the same vein as Sherwood Baptist Church's early efforts in Flywheel and Facing the Giants.  It is a very meaningful story about struggling with life and faith and the ultimate triumph of faith.,1316995200,,282,4.30188679245283
