8652233,2,B00JLPK6BS,"When I heard about the premise behind ""Nyaruko: Crawling With Love"", I was (cautiously) stoked. I love H.P. Lovecrafts short stories and novellas, and the idea of mixing his unique brand of cosmic horror with an anime romantic comedy seemed bizarre but brilliant. I could imagine the great comedy arising from cultural misunderstandings between an Old God and her human crush, as well as hellishly scary moments that become hilarious when it becomes clear theres no real danger. I could also imagine a really unique and complicated romance as the male protagonist figures out if he can love someone whose true form is an eldritch monster, as well as her cute insecurity over the same issue.

I imagined all that, but pal, let me tell you, I imagined wrong. ""Nyaruko"" almost completely ignores its Lovecraftian roots after the first episode and never looks back. Instead, we get the same super-clich&eacute;d storyline about teenaged alien police girls moving in with a reluctant earth-guy that has been repeated about three times annually since Tenchi Muyo aired back in the 1990s. There is no dread, no horror, and no depth to any Lovecraftian reference that would require more than glancing at a starter deck of the old Cthulhu Mythos card game (and thats honestly what it feels like the writers did). About 90% of the time, the Lovecraft elements get ignored entirely. It will occasionally toss out a Cthulhu chibi or a Ryleh name-drop to keep viewers from completely forgetting the premise, but for the most part this show is a pastiche of threadbare anime clich&eacute;s: beach episodes, being sucked inside a video game, hot springs, and transfer student hijinx at a high school. In short, if you came here for the Lovecraft element, you are going to be bitterly disappointed.

With all that said, is the show complete garbage? Well no. Once I put my seething Lovecraft nerd-rage aside, I came to appreciate that this show does have one big merit: ""Nyaruko"" and its characters are seriously funny. Nyaruko herself is one of the funniest characters Ive watched in a long time, a horny, spastic, unpredictable mess of a heroine with great facial expressions and altogether too much otaku obsession and baby-fever. Her unrequited would-be lover, Kyuuko, is one of those monotone dry-humor types, and her sincere longing for Nyaruko is sort of pathetic but also adorable. The male lead, Mahiro, is the straight-laced character of the bunch (as usual), but hes likeable and effectively manages the crawling chaos around him without being an unreasonable jerk or a sniveling wimp. Throughout, the comedic timing of this show is great, even if its referential humor sometimes falls a bit flat for me.

Still, laughs alone cant redeem this show. Even if ""Nyaruko"" couldn't muster originality or a well-executed premise, it could have tried for some sort of plot progression or character development. But, no. The reason Nyaruko and Hastur like Mahiro is a mystery, there is no villain or threat that lasts more than two episodes, and everyone ends the series the same person they were when the opening credits rolled.

So, if you're looking for a show with funny characters that will make you laugh, Nyaruko is pretty okay and will fit the bill. If you're looking for anything original, an overarching plot, or some sort of homage to the Lovecraft mythos, avoid it like the lurking fear.

(Coincidentally, if you would like to watch the kind of anime I mentioned in the first paragraph, it does exist.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Resurrection/dp/B005XB8SBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Resurrection</a>&nbsp;isnt Lovecraft-specific, but it deftly mixes horror elements into the anime ""harem romance"" framework in a really competent and compelling way that helps it surpass the limitations of its genre. Its a pity ""Nyaruko"" didn't forward the same kind of effort.)",1441843200,2,3925,5.223809523809524
8652234,5,B00JLPK6BS,If you like the cthulhu mythos then this anime is for you. This anime though a parody is very faithful to the cthulhu mythos with a lot of Easter eggs and gags tying into the mythos. Even if you have never had any experiences with the cthulhu mythos this is still a very good and funny anime.,1419379200,,292,4.140350877192983
8652235,5,B00JLPK6BS,"Its amazing, this anime is great,and very cute the box is a bit big but that just means I'm going to give it its own special place in my collection cant wait for next season to come on bluray",1406505600,,191,3.923076923076923
8652236,5,B00JLPK6BS,"Great packaging, the cover for the book and Two blu-rays that hold it firmly enough to not let it simply slide out, but not too tight as to cause damage to any of the packaging. The only draw-back is the fact that it wasn't released in English-dub. If you're a fan of the light novel, this is certainly a must have for your collection. Don't miss out.",1403395200,,351,4.253731343283582
8652237,5,B00JLPK6BS,This is perhaps one of the funniest comedy series that i have seen in my years as an amateur otaku. It parodies every genre of anime especially the teen high school harem romance. If your a fan of zany comedy you will probably love this,1400457600,5,236,4.266666666666667
8652238,1,B00JLPK6BS,"It's not intelligent or involving. Instead, it's a rather generic anime series about fighting aliens and getting into typical zany scenarios with the over-the-top characters. I didn't care for this one at all, and don't recommend it in the slightest. However, for those who are fans, know that NIS America once again delivers a stellar package from a PQ/AQ and packaging perspective.",1400371200,4,383,5.193548387096774
