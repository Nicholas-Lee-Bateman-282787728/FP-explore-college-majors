8475731,5,B005JJ0EB2,"I was in the audience at the fabulous California Theatre for this taping and waited months for it to be released on PBS. It's a perfectly lovely show featuring strong performances by all the principals. If you love Irish music and dance, this is one for your collection. In addition to having a wonderful tenor voice, Michael has a gift for bringing together amazing talents. If you get a chance to see the live show, don't miss it. You will not be disappointed. I believe these performers shine even more on the live stage than the DVD. Their genuine enthusiasm, talent and love for the genre make for a truly memorable experience.",1318464000,2,632,4.651785714285714
8475732,5,B005JJ0EB2,"Almost seven months ago I had the extreme pleasure of being at the taping of this show.  It was a night I will never, ever forget.  Now, I can relive that experience through this incredible DVD.  Michael just sparkles on stage and his voice is as breathtaking on the video as it is in person.  There truly is something for every musical taste......from folk to classical.....and beyond.  Watching it once won't be enough.  It's a DVD you will keep close and watch again and again.  I would certainly suggest buying your own because no one will want to turn loose of theirs long enough to loan it to you.",1318377600,2,603,4.477064220183486
