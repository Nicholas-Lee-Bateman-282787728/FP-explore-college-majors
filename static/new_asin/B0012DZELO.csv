3086635,5,B0012DZELO,"I didn't see much in the way of specific description of these videos here so I looked elsewhere online. From the movie makers website, kellysfilmworks here are their descriptions:
From the producers of 'The Perfect Stranger' comes a seven-episode miniserial that continues the stories of a modern-day Jesus walking amongst us.
EP1 'Woman at the Well' : A woman struggles with the concept of not being perfect because both her family and her church disapprove of her lifestyle. Stars Stephanie Vickers.
EP2 'The Prodigal Son': A young man (Brad Jackson) turns his back on a family fortune and winds up sleeping in an alley.
EP3 'Mary & Martha': Two sisters with very different outlooks run a family diner in rural Alabama.
Stars Christina Karis and Pattie Crawford.
EP4 'Salt' : A grad student (Amy Hess) faces a daily challenge in an outspoken agnostic professor (Percy Metcalf).
EP5 'Thomas': A boorish Chicago radio host berates his listeners on a nightly basis; tonight's topic: The Insanity of Faith. Stars Tom Luce and Matt Wallace.
EP6 'Mary Magdalene' : A conservative senator (Melissa Combs) has reservations about casting the deciding vote on a landmark abortion bill.
EP7 'Walk on Water' : A teenager (Alexis L. Hughes) grows weary of being harassed for her beliefs by her mean-spirited classmates.
From another source: echolight.com/thestrangerseries, here is a helpful description:
""Jefferson Moore (Clancy, A Perfect Gift) reprises his role as a modern-day Jesus comforting those whove lost hope in this television series based on David Gregorys best-selling Stranger novels. From the prodigal son to the woman at the well, several of Christs most important teachings are revisited in this essential, seven episode collection. Produced by Kellys Filmworks and featuring actors fans will recognize from the Stranger films, this series is a testament to the unconditional love of Jesus Christ. A teenager bullied for her faith, a heartbroken man haunted by unspeakable loss, and a woman ashamed of her reckless lifestyle are just a few of the lost souls who are reborn through miraculous encounters with a perfect stranger.""
I have not watched the videos myself (yet) - my process of deciding to get them or not let me to look for the above info and then I thought others would probably like to have that info readily available here also. My 4 star rating is made ""in faith"" that they will live up to the reviews of so many others here who spoke so well - if unspecifically - of these videos.
Edit: I finished them just now.  My faith was too small so I upped my 4 to a 5. Jeff Moore plays a great Jesus! Very real and down yo earth. I was blessed. I bought the set as a birth day gift for a friend.",1421452800,2,2710,4.865800865800866

3086641,5,B0012DZELO,"I love Jefferson Moore's movies.  They have such deep meaning and is a great movie for all ages..  His movies are so inspiring and sends such a deep message.  The only downside is that some of his movies are short.

I have seen all of his movies and it is gives such great hope of how to overcome tough obstacles through faith, endurance, and prosperity.

I find many movies has boring moments but not this movie.  I highly recommend all of his movies.

It is also so refreshing to watch a movie that does not have vulgarity, sex or violence.  I have such a good feeling after seeing his movies-inspiring",1413936000,3,604,4.427272727272728

This set should be in every home...it would be especially helpful in teaching non-believers about our beloved Savior! If there ever was a top-notch tool to show and explain christianity to people who don't know Christ, THIS IS IT!! I would also recommend it to families with young children, as a teaching tool...easier to let them watch this, then read a book. The last story, called ""Walk on Water"", is my favorite, and would be the best for those families with the young kids...all about bullying, and how christian kids get bullied because of how they live...clean, moral lives.

3086696,5,B0012DZELO,There are some great teachings in these shows.  The messages are so germane to today's issues.  The actor who plays Jesus does the best job I have seen.

3086703,5,B0012DZELO,"This 3 dvd set is such a great way to gently share the good news of Jesus.  The movies are engaging and not just talking heads, they keep you interested and are very well thought out.  A lot of the questions and answers are really worth hearing and will support your faith.  They will certainly help you give clear, kind, and memerable answers to questions often posed by those who don't yet believe.  Jefferson Moore and Kelly Filmworks do a remarkable job.  I found myself moved to tears in each of these scenarios at one time or another.  I find nothing that contradicts my beliefs or my faith.  What an awesome thought to imagine, if only for a brief time, that Jesus might be carrying on a conversation with you!  Surely it would be a great way to open discussions with youth groups, bible classes, etc, but even more than that, these movies speak to your heart as well.  If you are considering purchasing them, I sincerely believe you will not be dissappointed.",1333152000,4,967,4.543352601156069

How would I react in that situation?

3086716,5,B0012DZELO,"If you would like to see, or show to someone else, Jesus as the caring, friendly, here-now-alive heaven-and-earth-bridging Man that he is, this miniseries is one of a group of good movies, including Jefferson Moore's ""The Perfect Stranger,"" ""Another Perfect Stranger,"" and ""The Perfect Gift.""",1323907200,10,292,5.511111111111111

3086719,5,B0012DZELO,"This is the one of the best series I have seen.  My only problem with it is that I wish they were making more of these episodes.  Everyone in my family - except my two year old loved these.  In my home, we have a grandparent, two parents, and three kids under the age of 10.  We watched an episode each night until they were done.  Then, when we finished them, we started over again for a second round.  These are the greatest.  These episodes show the love of God to us.  They make Jesus seem more real.  I know my oldest children saw Jesus as more of a friend after watching these.",1312675200,10,583,4.088495575221239
3086720,5,B0012DZELO,I love the way these movies go about getting the message across. I was sorry there were only 7 of them. At least that is all I could find.,1302912000,,138,3.793103448275862
3086721,5,B0012DZELO,"What a lame title for a review. So what if Jesus really did live today. How would he interact with people. Why wouldn't he stand up and just say, ""Hi, I'm Jesus.""?

All this and more gets answered in really meaningful ways, including the two episodes where he DOES say, ""I'm Jesus."" More answers to life than you'll find anywhere else. I really thank the Moores (Jefferson and his wife Kelly) for bring us this series and continuing the stories created by David Gregory in his book series.

Perfect for all ages.",1302825600,,512,4.554347826086956

3086723,5,B0012DZELO,"The ""Stranger Series Box Set"" of videos is one of the best sets of videos we have ever experienced.  Each video is short enough to keep your attention and not get bored or lose your train of thought.  They are very good at getting the message across.  They could be used in many ways to help anyone in their attempt to bring someone to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and His way of dealing with situations in one's life and of living in this world full of doubt as to whether Christ truly does exist or not.",1301961600,3,506,4.195876288659794

From the producers of 'The Perfect Stranger' comes a seven-episode miniserial that continues the stories of a modern-day Jesus walking amongst us.
EP1 'Woman at the Well' : A woman struggles with the concept of not being perfect because both her family and her church disapprove of her lifestyle. Stars Stephanie Vickers.
EP2 'The Prodigal Son': A young man (Brad Jackson) turns his back on a family fortune and winds up sleeping in an alley.
EP3 'Mary & Martha': Two sisters with very different outlooks run a family diner in rural Alabama.
Stars Christina Karis and Pattie Crawford.
EP4 'Salt' : A grad student (Amy Hess) faces a daily challenge in an outspoken agnostic professor (Percy Metcalf).
EP5 'Thomas': A boorish Chicago radio host berates his listeners on a nightly basis; tonight's topic: The Insanity of Faith. Stars Tom Luce and Matt Wallace.
EP6 'Mary Magdalene' : A conservative senator (Melissa Combs) has reservations about casting the deciding vote on a landmark abortion bill.
EP7 'Walk on Water' : A teenager (Alexis L. Hughes) grows weary of being harassed for her beliefs by her mean-spirited classmates.
From another source: echolight.com/thestrangerseries, here is a helpful description:
""Jefferson Moore (Clancy, A Perfect Gift) reprises his role as a modern-day Jesus comforting those whove lost hope in this television series based on David Gregorys best-selling Stranger novels. From the prodigal son to the woman at the well, several of Christs most important teachings are revisited in this essential, seven episode collection. Produced by Kellys Filmworks and featuring actors fans will recognize from the Stranger films, this series is a testament to the unconditional love of Jesus Christ. A teenager bullied for her faith, a heartbroken man haunted by unspeakable loss, and a woman ashamed of her reckless lifestyle are just a few of the lost souls who are reborn through miraculous encounters with a perfect stranger.""
I have not watched the videos myself (yet) - my process of deciding to get them or not let me to look for the above info and then I thought others would probably like to have that info readily available here also. My 4 star rating is made ""in faith"" that they will live up to the reviews of so many others here who spoke so well - if unspecifically - of these videos.

It is definitely worth the investment. I think they would be great for a youth group or class.  MM,1224288000,2,375,4.391304347826087

The stories are interesting and make one really think about our relationships with others, ourselves and our purpose in life. I absolutely love them and you will too.",1215475200,2,284,4.588235294117647
3321259,5,B0012DZELO,"I think the entire ""STRANGER"" series, including both movies, are well worth viewing.  While I have a few theological quibbles, on the whole the pieces are well done and restrained.  I would not be embarrassed by having a non-Christian friend see them.  And given the state of evangelical Christianity today that is saying something.",1215129600,8,332,5.111111111111111

3321274,4,B0012DZELO,"The series is not as good as the initial movie or its sequel.  However, they present solid characters whose problems can't be solved by cliches or pious platitudes.  There is an honest effort to deal with these problems in the context of man meets God, heart to heart.  I value these stories and use them in my Bible class.",1212019200,3,323,4.440677966101695

  Seven 30 minute stories of people, who are troubled in various ways, meeting Jesus as a Stranger with advice and help. This is an excellent enjoyable set of stories that is inspiring, instructive, and which gives answers for Christians about many questions that have been often asked about the Bible truths.
  It is a great compliment to ""The Perfect Stranger"" and ""Anther Perfect Stranger"" DVDs.
  Very hearwarming stories and, in my opinion, a must for all believers and for those who are seeking the Truth without being bored or shouted at.",1211846400,2,717,6.181818181818182
3321278,5,B0012DZELO,"I was really impressed by this video series because it shows the heart of Jesus as he really is.  It is one thing to know about him, another to really know him and his love for us and how he cares about everything we go through in life.  I was especially touched by the ""Walk on water"" segment, one of the seven in the series.  Watch it and see if you can keep your eyes dry.  John.",1211414400,,382,3.9220779220779223

8245387,4,B0012DZELO,"Although you could watch these shorter films before watching the Perfect Stranger Trilogy, I advise watching the full-length movies first as they do a great job introducing Jefferson Moore's portrayal of Jesus.  This set is, basically, seven stories from the Gospels, recast in modern times.  Jefferson Moore and a number of other cast members pull off their respective roles very well.  I'm sharing this series with friends!",1492905600,,425,5.313432835820896
