8563072,5,B000GB0X0U,"The film is based on a classic Dutch novel from the 19th Century by one who was disgusted with the way that his countrymen ran the colony of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and their treatment of the locals. The film succeeds in showing how the reality of what was happening there was oblivious to those at home. The scenery is beautiful and the director Fons Rademakers succeeds in bringing home the severity with which his countrymen treated the locals during that colonial period.

8563073,5,B000GB0X0U,"Brute imperialism of the early 19th century exposed up close and personal. Based on revelatory ""novel"" of 1860, depicts the tensions created by Dutch exploitation of Indonesia at the height of the colonial era in the early 19th century.  Shot in remarkable color with much footage of formerly undeveloped Indonesia.  Film was made during the 1970's at the time of the massacres in East Timor and the destruction of Timorese society by the Indonesian military. Looks at representatives of every level of society and involvement in the tragic onslaught of the imperialist project and manages to evoke the largest questions concerning the human quest for fulfillment and the price we feel its worth.  You will never forget it - if you chance to see it - a big IF - as the film was ruthlessly suppressed in this country after a brief showing at art houses and college/university venues.",1200528000,3,882,4.906040268456376
