5546050,5,B00B1E6FT4,The best documentary I have ever viewed.  I  learned so much and was in awe of the amazing pictures.  Awesome!,1381708800,,110,4.4
5546051,5,B00B1E6FT4,I chose to watch this because I love the sciences. I love learning about the earth and all the things on it.,1381708800,,108,3.9545454545454546
5546052,5,B00B1E6FT4,"Excellent program!  Great information about volcanoes.  I've seen the volcanoes in Hawaii and Mt. St. Helenes in Washington.  I was very impressed at how quickly the landscape can repair itself  after an eruption in Washington.  Also, how reluctant people are to leave when the scientists say it is time to go.  Great job on producing this series.",1381449600,,347,5.0
5546053,5,B00B1E6FT4,This is by far one of the best nature documentaries I have ever seen. The stark contrast between the destructive power of nature and the tenacity of life is elegantly captured.,1381190400,,176,4.709677419354839
5546054,5,B00B1E6FT4,This is an excellent video that anyone who likes nature should watch. Well worth the price. My daughter loves it.,1380931200,,113,4.7
5546055,5,B00B1E6FT4,"Jeremy Irons does a wonderful job narrating this series. I am not even someone who follows geological issues, but I found this to be a wonder and educational series.",1376956800,,165,4.724137931034483
5546056,5,B00B1E6FT4,I loved watching this documentary on PBS so I decided to buy it. The high definition video is stunning whether in landscape or up close. Highly recommend!,1372723200,,154,4.7407407407407405
5546057,5,B00B1E6FT4,"This specialised French documentary series is one of the best I have ever come across. I suggest viewing the making of on disc 2 first as it explains the special cameras and techniques used. The English narration by Jeremy Irons is slow and crystal clear with excellent subtitles for all episodes except the making of doco. The picture and sound on this Blu-ray is exceptional.
The selection of the subject matter shows considerable initiative and I was fascinated from beginning to end, This is a region A set but if you can play it it is a no-brainer to anyone with a curious mind. I would give it 6 out of 5 if that was an option. Quite wonderful.",1371859200,10,650,4.470588235294118
5546058,4,B00B1E6FT4,"This is a nice video, although I have seen better.  I eat up anything about geological history. The video footage is very good.",1369526400,,127,4.521739130434782
5546059,5,B00B1E6FT4,"I've seen ten or twelve videos through the years going as far back as 1980's Mt. St. Helens.  What more could I possibly learn?  Well, it seems, quite a bit.

The video picture is probably breathtaking.  Though I watched it in standard DVD on a low definition tube screen.
Iceland doesn't call for travelogue quality video.  It's a treeless, mostly barren volcanic-rock landscape shrouded in volcanic smoke, steam and ash. The second hour does go to Peru and Hawaii providing relief from the hopelessness
for the future of Iceland.

It is the voice of Jeremy Irons that lifts this otherwise ordinary video of volcanoes into an extraordinary dramatic masterpiece of art.  If there were an awards category for required viewing DVDs for the blind, this would win hands down.  In fact I ""watched"" the first hour a second time with my eyes closed listening to the lilting, melodic, mellifluous tones of the narrator.

Mr. Irons narration alone sets this apart from all other gems in my collection.",1369267200,2,992,4.892215568862276
5546079,4,B00B1E6FT4,"A bit of a slow start, I suppose they needed to tell the backstory about the scientific research of volcanic activity in order to give earlier warnings of eruptions, to save more people's lives. These first couple of episodes really did not get into how the animals and plants coexist as well as they do in the presence of the risk of such explosive and devastating eruptions. Interesting show, once it gets into the ""wildlife vs volcanic environment"" mode.",1464739200,,457,4.7974683544303796
5546080,5,B00B1E6FT4,Great show.  Shows multiple effects Volcanos have on wildlife.  Really well-done.,1463616000,,81,6.2727272727272725

5546145,5,B00B1E6FT4,"Like many of the nature/science programs presented on PBS, Life on Fire is beautifully presented and loaded with things to think about. I love watching it over and over and I hope you will too...

I loved this program when it first appeared on PBS and, since I signed up for Prime recently, I think I've watched it three or four times. I love being able to watch the older PBS programs on my Roku whenever I want as part of my Prime membershipI don't have cable and pick up local TV on rabbit ears. Since I watch something from Amazon practically every day I figure it's worth the 27 cents a day Prime costs me... it's certainly a lot less than cable and I get to watch when I want to!",1444176000,,685,4.1893939393939394

The narration is perfect and the interaction with the scientists trying to get so they can predict the next one is fascinating. The creators of that episode put just enough ""earth noise"" into the background to bring it all to life. That said, all of them are beautifully done and very informative and entertaining.

5546509,5,B00B1E6FT4,"We loved every episode of this series. Beautiful cinematography, interesting facts and details. The one ""difficulty"" that I had was in the way that some of this was filmed. Instead of standing still and panning across the vista, the photographer chose a constantly moving point to shoot from (this ""shooting point"" was constantly moving in a slowly closing vortex), I found that I had several instances of motion sickness during the viewing- especially the Iceland episode. Not a pleasant moment! On the other hand, my husband has never had motion sickness problems and didn't have a problem with it at all. Unfortunately, our 9-year-old son also had to close his eyes several times during that episode to get over the same problem I had.

In HD this show is a great reason for having a big screen, it's just filmed so well.

5546611,4,B00B1E6FT4,"Have watched the first two in the season - the first episode was quite interesting, focusing on the volcanoes of Iceland.  The second (and the first somewhat) focused on the research methods used in the attempt to determine when an eruption is imminent and how the surrounding cities/towns/villages are alerted.  Interesting to see how many people either stay at their homes during these events; or if they leave,how quickly they return.  Worth watching - the narrator is Jeremy Irons and he does a great job.",1385769600,,509,4.964705882352941

5546660,5,B00B1E6FT4,"I missed this on the local PBS station so when Amazon offered it, especially in HD, I clicked on it to begin and was very sorry it was only 6 episodes.
While it was filmed by several people over time, the details of animals and the habitats they exist in when a volcano both destroys and creates, was fascinating.
The graphics they used to re-create what happened in the past to match the future were outstanding. The up to date shots of what  is currently going on was better than most, especially underwater.
And to top it all off, Jeremy Irons narrating. Wow!!!!
If you missed this on TV, this is one of the must see programs through Amazon. Watch and learn. I don't think I will ever view a volcano in the same way.",1383436800,,719,4.325925925925926

5546673,4,B00B1E6FT4,"More than any other documentary, this series provides insight into the daily lives of people and creatures living in the shadows of active volcanoes. In fact those who tune in, like me, to see and hear more about the scientific nature of volcanoes, and the devastation of past eruptions, will be somewhat disappointed. However, the discussion of life continuing to coexist in an area of impending disaster is educational and well presented.  Having lived through what has been called ""The Eruption of the Century (20th)"" I have quite a fascination. This series only deepened my thirst. You'll enjoy it.",1382659200,,602,5.08080808080808

5546675,3,B00B1E6FT4,"First two episodes are worth 5 stars hands down. Episode 3 had the technical quality, but not only didn't. Fit the series thus far, it also inserted a sci-fi type fish story in the mix.  Obviously, yet another salmon life cycle story that turn a subject that was interesting and fit the series (wildlife around volcanoes, specifically the Surprise Lake salmon) and stretches it out into a long boring fantasy about the 'struggles' of this particular subset of a fish.  Supposedly set -2000 years ago, it introduces modern events and pure speculative 'adventure' hazards to fluff up the episode and presents them as 'real scientific' history.

No problem with the subject, but all the fact, backstory and theory could have been done in 15-20 minutes as a subsegment.  With all the really interesting stuff about volcanoes and life around them why do filler work so early?  Especially mixing speculative fiction in with fact.  Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

EDIT: Contrasting with a great Episode 4, which is more of a nature film about life on & around a volcano between eruptions than about volcanic activity, Episode 3 stinks even worse.",1382572800,2,1132,4.98936170212766

5546696,5,B00B1E6FT4,"The series is not just about vulcanism, an already fairly dry subject, its about how volcanoes  create unique pathways for life that wouldn't otherwise exist. Incredible. The most memorable to me is how a salmon run in spite of an eruption still makes it to the far side of a poison volcanic lake to lay their eggs in a small fresh water spring. Just absolutely incredible. I've never heard of this series before and its an absolute gem.",1381795200,,437,4.602564102564102
