3652418,4,B001J697BC,"""Bab Aziz: The Price Who Contemplated His Soul"" is a mix of many stories ...some of which I still wonder why they are there.  I love the basic story of the blind grandfather and his granddaughter and the teaching of faith and the beauty of death.  The poem...or song...""Arise O day, the atoms are dancing in molecular esctasy.  Come my love-let us go join with them. "" is worth watching the movie.  It is mind expanding to see how many ways people have to worship (sufism, mysticism etc.)",1238803200,16,488,4.511363636363637
3652419,5,B001J697BC,"The film and the music are both very good, but when all is said and done the music is the best. I would give it four and a half, as some of the acting is a bit stiff, but really, I couldn't bear to give it only four stars. It's a visual feast, it's movingly beautiful, gentle and subtle. It's understated, and not in-your-face spiritual messaging, which can be so irritating. It's like ""this is what it is"". No high drama.

Too bad the audio CD is so expensive (as of March 2009, it was $61, no clue why). I would buy it in a heartbeat at the regular price. anitaroy@gmail.com.",1237161600,9,577,4.198198198198198

3652421,5,B001J697BC,"Bab Aziz is a feast for the eyes, the ears, and most of all the heart. A small girl follows her elderly grandfather out into the desert of the soul in search of a gathering of dervishes, and what a gathering it is!  But getting there, like life itself, is the transformative part, without which the arriving itself can never happen. This tale within a tale within a tale is sure to delight fans of Sufism, mysticism, great epic tales, and really good music.  I saw this film four times the first week it was in theaters.  Chances are, a lot of DVD viewers will view and re-view this enchanting visual epiphany often.",1228608000,51,616,4.433628318584071

3652434,5,B001J697BC,"All the other 5 star reviews say something about this film that I whole-heartedly agree with. It's depth is revealed in its apparent simplicity. BAB'AZIZ, etc. is charming, lovely, captivating from start to finish. And what a start! The little granddaughter digs herself out from the sand that has buried her while she slept. Then she helps Bab'aziz do the same. The little girl has a LOT of charisma & turns in flawless performance. She's a little greedy around food issues, but she can really dance! I absolutely LOVED her.

To attempt a description beyond this is a fool's errand. The film has a style unto itself. I will say this, there is nothing but beauty and gentle grace in the story. Oh, I'll say this--the band of musicians were wonderful! What an amazing thing in this day & age to find such an inspiring film with such a welcoming Islamic ambiance. There is so much BAB'AZIZ has to offer the weary soul.

I probably watched the film 20 times in the first month alone.

NOTE: I saw this film for the first time on LINK TV. Check it out...",1384214400,,1050,4.515789473684211
3652435,5,B001J697BC,Not only is this film beautifully photographed but it is a great sufi teaching tale filled with mystical characters and events.  It quickly engages the heart and mind in a lovely unfolding of life's beginnings and endings. A must see.,1378598400,2,234,4.85
3652436,5,B001J697BC,"This film is not only visually beautiful but pulls you in spiritually to the heart of the dervish. Stirring and fascinating, this is my favorite film! I will watch it over and over as I love the way it stirs my soul...and the final gathering is just stunning!",1375574400,,259,4.416666666666667
3652437,5,B001J697BC,"It took me a while to get into the right mood since it is contemplative, little action.  But the more I watched the more I became absorbed by the depth of feeling.  Whirling dervishes, a blind old man walking through the desert with his granddaughter, tapping his cane on the sand, archetypal characters that represent different aspects of the muslim culture, characters who are complex, with both generous and resentful feelings.  An old man who shows an exemplary patience in dealing with a small child, and the child herself, with blossoming maturity, a character who gets in trouble for having killed someone, but it turns out that the victim wanted to die and the red-haired devil was obliging him. A great film, which I shall show to others and see again myself several times.",1374796800,,782,4.82089552238806

3652440,5,B001J697BC,"Bab'Aziz is a remarkable, enchanting and transcendent film. This is a film to be shown in every school to every child and in every church/worship service. This film is a torch set ablaze, transforming our world. Bab'Aziz is by far the best, most poetic and prophetic response I've seen yet to human hatred, political rants, & brandishing of weapons, which predictably polarize, dehumanize, demonize and destroy. This film re-humanizes us all by clearly depicting the best of what humans can be with subtle dignity, grace, humor, wisdom, and kindness. Although this film depicts Muslim culture, this film's themes are universal involving love, egotism, desire, spiritual questing and the nature of humanity. In this film the power of love dismantles roots of human ignorance and violence.

The themes in this film are truly epic and magical, the scenery and cinematography stellar.

 The film opens with a young girl emerging from a crevasse in the sand. She and her aged, blind grandfather then proceed on a magical journey through the dunes of the desert while he instructs his young 'whippersnapper' of a granddaughter about what is most important in life,imparting his wisdom with understanding, patience, tolerance and love.  As they walk on their journey to the whirling dervish gathering, Ishtar, the young girl (a phenomenal actress!) is told a story by her grandfather centered around a young prince who is captivated by and led on a journey through the desert by a gazelle and is radically and permanenetly altered by this experience.

Women in this film are powerful, mysterious, sensual, and vibrant, all portrayed without the cliche, requisite disrobement  commonly expected by run-of-the mill, mainstream cinematography & advertising.  BRAVO! The dancing of the young woman before the prince is utterly sexy, captivating and alluring. Beautiful women in brightly colored robes run through an ancient temple as a young lustful man seeks his beloved at the bottom of a well. At one point, Ishtar, the young girl, lifts the veil of a beautiful woman who sings a song of her beloved in the most exquisite, haunting voice.

This film also addresses aging and death in relation to youth. At the end of the film the lead man, who was actually 86 when he did this film says to the afraid younger man, not to be afraid of death because it is my ""marriage with eternity.""

I NEVER watch movies more than once. I have seen this film 3 times and can't WAIT to watch it again and again.",1361836800,2,2486,4.971084337349398
3652441,5,B001J697BC,"As always, rating a movie is dependent on the attitudes and personality of the person doing the rating.  If you chose this film because you don't know what it is about and don't understand Sufism, you won't understand the movie either.  If you are, however, familiar with Middle Eastern cultures and Sufism, you will love this movie!  Also, you will love the music in the movie, as well.",1351728000,2,387,4.661764705882353
3652442,5,B001J697BC,"A must-see in Iranian film.

3652443,5,B001J697BC,This is a very good movie and I recommend watching it. It is about Sufism with a lot of colors and music.,1323734400,,105,3.8181818181818183
3652444,5,B001J697BC,"This movie is so breathtaking, subtle, symbolic, beautiful, spiritual that I am having difficulty writing this. Nothing I could say does this movie justice.

I look at the symbolism woven throughout; which itself dances like a dervish, and my mind recognizes the references; and the sheer genius of it's composition. But my heart reacts in a way no intellectual concept could label or classify. Every moment there is another unfolding,,,,

This movie is what Islam is REALLY about. It is a Sufi tale; the beauty of Islam taken to its furthest reaches. This movie takes you into the realm where one sees with one's heart, by the Light of God. Eyes are useless there.

I can't write anymore,,, There is nothing more to say.",1310428800,4,721,4.798387096774194
3652445,5,B001J697BC,"This film is a pleasure to watch each time you play it.  Really, it doesn't get old and keeps your attention throughout.  It is filled with spiritual concepts that one understands more and more of as the film is watched and re-watched.  The presentation of the film is perfect.  It is the story of the old man and his young granddaughter following their spiritual path and meeting others on their own paths.  The individual stories are revealed wonderfully and intertwined beautifully.  I don't want to say more for fear of detracting from the ""first view"" experience, but I strongly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys meaningful and thought provoking content.  Great film.",1298505600,,679,4.95575221238938
3652446,5,B001J697BC,"It comes unexpectedly, the gazelle .
And the prince sees it. A gazelle, beautiful, magical and so out of the mundane world appears for a fleeting moment. In that magical moment, the prince suddenly and silently bursts from his old shell only to bloom toward love and oneness.
How do you put love, surrender, a journey, discovery, acceptance and mystery in a movie? How does scenes, moments, words and music touch your soul and remind you, an angel has put their finger under your lips? That you contain all answers but each answer comes to you when you are ready?
As a Sufi saying goes,""there are many paths, but only one destination.""
How does a poem turn into a  movie?
This movie is a ray of rapture; rapture  of lovers of God.
Even in the sandy dessert, you feel, see and smell the garden of love.
 in the frail steps of an old dervish, in the swift restless steps of a little girl, in the passionate singing of the dervishes, in the search for loved ones, love is the invisible, fragile, beautiful and yet strong force that covers the whole movie like a blanket woven with mystical beauty.
How could death be the ending of something that has no beginning, Baba aziz asks.
He is ready for continuing his journey. And that's another step in surrender. Surrender to the great mystery.",1283472000,7,1286,4.558441558441558
3652447,5,B001J697BC,"I watched tis movie on a blizzard day, the perfect day for a movie like this. From the beginning you are transported to another place, time and exotic surroundings... there are no words to describe the feelings that this movie provoked in me.
The whole story is a sweet one, the relationship between grandpa and the girl is simply adorable, the tales are magic and full of colours and arabic sounds and wonders, the music is great and the dances are amazing, never saw an old man dancing like this.
Beautiful, beautiful film. I also watched the extras, the interview with Nacer in French is very moving and deep, he is right in all he is saying, the best way to express himself (his deep feelings) is through films and boy did he do a great job!
Highly recommended, please watch with an open heart, it's simply sublime.
Enjoy this movie!",1265846400,7,837,4.549668874172186
3652448,5,B001J697BC,"Even tho the blind, aged Dervish doesn't know the way as he journeys with his granddaugther thru the desert to the Dervish gathering, he has his faith to guide him. He is wise and at one with the world. And he must make this pilgrimage. We all do. As we will learn at the end.

Like ""The Arabian Nights"", this incorporates other stories within the main one -- of people on private quests. While the stories are very dramatic, they are subtly explored in vague and dreamlike ways -- like a Sufi tale.

This movie is more than that, however. It's also a sensory experience. This is an unbelievably beautiful film. Of desertscape. Of buildings and vibrant artifacts. Of haunting music and poetry.

While the Tunisia-born writer/director Nacer Khemi may be a lost soul, torn between his present life in France and his Arabic background, and anguished by the present-day turmoil of the Islamic world, he has sublimated his painful, personal quest into a film of great beauty.",1264291200,7,970,4.761904761904762
3652449,5,B001J697BC,"The film itself is five-star.  It's MARVELOUS AND MAGICAL.  BUT:

I ordered Bab'Aziz believing that I would receive a film in Farsi WITH ENGLISH subtitles so it would be comprehensible.  There were no subtitles AND there was no subtitle area to go to on the DVD to choose an English option! I gave this film as a PRESENT to my daughter, for us to share together.  I drove 178 miles to share it with her.  PAIN PAIN PAIN

On the packaging it SAID there was an English subtitle option -- but there wasn't.  I don't speak a word of Farsi, nor does my daughter,so the film was a total loss for us.  That's especially disappointing, since I'm retired and trying to live on a fixed income.  I wasted at least an hour trying to find a way to send feedback to you, Amazon -- but there is no such possibility.  Sure, I could have wasted more time repackaging it AND SPENDING MY OWN MONEY TO RECTIFY YOUR MISTAKE!  UN-BE-LIEVABLE!  INSULTING!  CHEAP!

Suggestions:

1.  ALLOW YOUR CUSTOMERS TO SEND FEEDBACK TO YOU, AMAZON!!
2.  DON'T CHARGE YOUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE YOUR MISTAKE RIGHT!!

Because your system is biased 100% in favor of you, corporate Amazon, I will be striving to end my customer relationship with you.  You don't care about me -- so I don't want to be hurt again, and will seek alternatives to what has been a fairly good me - Amazon customer relationship until now.

Shannon Tolson",1258588800,4,1399,4.516
3652450,5,B001J697BC,"Bab'aziz had been so highly recommended to me by so many people that I fully expected to be disappointed. How could it be that good? But to my astonishment, it was and is that good. It works on so many levels. And repeated viewings bring further understanding, further ""Oh!"" moments, as previously overlooked meanings and linkages become clear. (Don't worry about missing them the first or second time; Bab'aziz will still be engrossing and memorable, with no feeling of having missed anything. The subsequent ""Oh! moments are simply bonuses.)

8312030,5,B001J697BC,"This is one of my favorite movies, along with Tarkovsky's movie Andrei Rublev and Angelopolous' movie The Weeping Meadow.

This movie is a fantasy movie.  It doesn't take place in a fantasy world like Lord of the Rings, but the movie is not intended to be realistic.  It is an allegory in movie form.  And this allegory comes with my favorite soundtrack.  The music is the most important part of this film for me.  I really enjoy how the film is very philosophical and spiritual, but the music is what makes this film so special.  The music is what transports you into a different world, into a different mindset.

This movie is my go to movie when I want to relax.  I put in this movie and follow Bab'Aziz and Ishtar as they trek across the desert.  This movie gives a sense of peace and tranquility that helps me so much when I feel stressed out.

I don't hold any illusion that this movie is an accurate portrayal of what it is like to be a Sufi Muslim.  I don't hold any illusion that this movie accurately depicts the Sufi culture.  I see it as a wonderfully beautiful fantasy film, a wonderful allegory, a source of peace, tranquility, and the most beautiful music that I've ever heard in a movie.",1501286400,,1203,4.413636363636364

In terms of content, I can say that I admire, almost to the point of jealousy, the way in wish Sufis live their faith, with so much joy, with music and dancing (remember the way King David adored God by dancing)! I am a Christian, and the main character, Bab'Aziz, reminded me a lot of the mystic rhetoric of the Catholic faith. I commend director Nacer Khemir for showing the beauty of this face of Islam that we are not bombarded with, but rather, that we have to seek in order to see.",1456876800,4,596,4.330357142857143
