4718040,4,B005KP74RW,"There are several naysayer critics floating around the world-wide-web, presenting in newspaper print who wail loudly for ""more narrative"" in this documentary.  They just don't get it. Real, raw, and rousing, this story defies the polished British-accented narrator in favor of local flavor.  Talihina Sky provides a glimpse into the multitude of forces which shape the Kings of Leon.  Fundamental religion, fanaticism, and utterly dour socioeconomic conditions name a few. The parallels which compare their roots to the rock paint an eerily ironic picture.  Quaking music fans and pentecostal parishioners dominate the scene.  If you desire a cohesive, well-outlined history lesson of the band, pull up the Wikipedia article.  Otherwise sit back with this film and become enlightened to the band's inner spirit.  And watch life roll by.",1323388800,11,836,5.484375

4718042,5,B005KP74RW,"As KOL's lead singer Caleb states ""A lot of people were telling our story, but they got it all wrong, so we decided to tell our own story, so people would know the truth."" And that is what this Rock Documentary is all about, a very well presented story & history of the KOL as told by the members themselves, along with Caleb, Nathan, and Jared's Divorced Father & Mother and many of their relatives. It also includes input from KOL band member Matthew, who is a 1st Cousin to the 3 brothers. All 4 members of the KOL bear the same last name of Followill. This ""Rock Doc"" begans at a Followill Family Reunion in their hometown of Talihina, Oklahoma, which is located in rural Southeastern Oklahoma, in a county that intersects with the Arkansas border. Talihina is a American Choctaw Indian name for ""Iron Road""

In this ""Rock Doc"" Caleb covers the process they went through in selecting a name for their band. Then Caleb clearly states that their name ""Kings of Leon"", was chosen in honor of all the band members' Granddad, Leon Mitchell Followill. Their Granddad & Grandma, Leon Mitchell Followill & Mildred Ledell Brown Followill are both in this ""Rock Doc"". They reside in the KOL's hometown of Talihina, Oklahoma.

The KOL were raised in a strict, Southern Pentecostal background, the 3 members whose father was a Pentecostal Evangelist Preacher, traveled throughout the Mid South, conducting revivals at Pentecostal Churhes. I was raised in a strict Southern Penetecostal background myself, so I can definitely relate to what they went through while growing up. Legendary Louisiana Rocker Jerry Lee Lewis was also raised in this type of environment to a certain extent. One of my uncles was a Pentecostal Preacher. It's a very stressful job, people call you 24 hours a day/7 days a week. So, I can understand how their father ""burned out"" and ""fell from his ministry"" as a Pentecostal evangelist preacher. I have a lot of respect for their father. He very candidly states in this ""Rock Doc"", that he hit the bottom, and begin drinking heavily, to escape from the pain he was experiencing from his ""burn-out"" and ""fall"". He goes on to state that ""when you hit the bottom, you do what you have to do"". Also, I respect him because he states that ""when he was a traveling  Pentecostal Evangelist Preacher, he never begged for money, because he didn't like to see other Preachers begging for money"". So, they just made whatever amount of money the churches were willing to give them, which resulted in them living basically in poverty. It covers the story of how the KOL's strict Southern Pentecostal background eventually transformed them into becoming one of the biggest Rock bands in the world. The ""fall"" of their Pentecostal Evangelist Father, Ivan Leon Followill lead to the divorce between the 3 brothers' mother (Betty Ann) & their father (Ivan Leon).

This ""Rock Doc"" contains a lot of candid, intimate home video's of the boys growing up. These videos includes church videos and show the boys' singing gospel songs at church. It also contains home video's of the boys and family members growing up in Southeastern Oklahoma. It includes home & professional videos including commentaries from their divorced mother & father, and many many commentaries & videos from their many relatives. It shows the rural environment where they grew up in, bacisally in Talihina, Oklahoma. It shows them playing in a creek that was one of their main fun spots, while growing up.

Overall, their divorced mother & father, along with their many relatives seem to be ""acccepting"" and very proud of them, for their success in the World of Rock & Roll.

This is a very interesting ""Rock Doc"" to watch. The dvd package includes a ""family tree"" of the Followill Family. Also, the dvd has an approximate running time of 135 minutes, according to the back of the dvd case, which is longer that what the Amazon Product Description states. It contains ""Special Features"" including deleted scenes, home movies, & additional commentaries. If you like the Kings of Leon, you'll love this history & story of the band members. At the very end during the ""credits"" portion of the dvd, the song ""Radioactive"" is played as background music. It fits in just perfect, especially with the lyrics ""When the role is called up Yonder, I hope you'll see me there....It's in the water, where you came from...."". And this dvd shows you exactly where they came from.",1323129600,8,4431,4.823684210526316

4718053,5,B005KP74RW,"I was cat sitting and giving kitty some lap time when I stumbled over this on Netflix (sorry Amazon).  It is a entertaining even revealing true story about what goes into making a bunch of guys into Rock Band arena rock.  I like rock and roll but I have not been exposed to much of their music and was unfamiliar with their material.  I think a really good job was done in picking out the sound bits for the soundtrack.  It has made me want to listen to more of their music to find out if I like it.  These guys want to be organic even if they are a little poppy now and then.  The visuals and camera work are good to.  This video was done back when the band was in their ""hair band"" prime. Gotta love the hair.  My favorite part however, is an interview of their mom who says she heard a voice say to her ""it is done"" and she's filled with light before she goes into some claptrap about speaking in tongues and uh, the light goes. . .away. . . But for a moment she is beautific about her boys.  Rock band fame is definitely a specific calling.",1406419200,,1044,4.053658536585366

4718063,3,B005KP74RW,It was somewhat entertaining but the story of the band it is not. How they made it from adolescence to the band they are is hardly mentioned. The comments from their father Ivan are probably the most poignant words spoken during the piece.,1376092800,,239,4.5813953488372094

my husband is like a cowboy  and I'm a rocker so I was pretty happy  when We watched this documentary on TV and he fell in love  with Kings of Leon then I decided to get him this for Christmas.

I got a little bit scared when I read that ITALIAN is the  language LOL I didn't understand that, but  it's in english (phew) and  we can't stop watching it, such a cool documentary you don't want to miss it.

4718074,2,B005KP74RW,They have truely come a long way. But I guess I was expecting a little different story about them. It was kind of trailer trashy.,1354838400,,129,4.2
4718075,5,B005KP74RW,"From their dominant religious upbringing to their brilliant rise to the top, Kings Of Leon truly are a sight to see.  Named after their paternal grandfather ""Leon"", of whom they are ""Kings Of"", they have been performing as one of the most celebrated bands of late.

Talihina Sky tells the intricate and enticing story of the Followill band of brothers (Nathan, Caleb, and Jared - all their middle names) along with their first cousin Matthew Followill who also joined in.  This documentary is done in such an appealing and down to earth style. I have watched it several times already while catching up to something new with each viewing. It doesn't wave celebrity at you and it isn't showy whatsoever .

Beginning this rich tale is to start with the boy's impoverished, zealously Pentecostal childhood.  Their side of the family was strict; devout, although favorably balanced through their mother Betty Ann. Their father Ivan, being an evangelical preacher who led revival meetings that the boys were always attending gradually turned around.  Ivan and Betty Ann were divorced while the boys were in their later teen years. She comments throughout the film as does Ivan.

We see this come into view back and forth as the documentary plays through with plenty of interesting narrative and dialog from a huge family.  They are at their annual family reunion including an abundance of relatives in a very rural Talihina, OK. locale where all sorts of their people are gathered.  This certainly is an interesting documented family portrait.

They have many uncles, cousins, etc. who all join in and make this yearly occasion quite a shindig for several days. There are little shacks all over the property, animals and a creek that their grandmother named ""the best babysitter in the world"". Nathan, Caleb, Jared, and Matthew come without any pretense and without an attitude of any superiority.  They don't even bring an instrument, only themselves and a spirit of fun as they look forward to this get together all year long.

The time spent there brings away with it a heavy reflection of being brought up ""poor"" and having only two pairs of pants trading between Caleb and Nathan to wear to school.  Caleb talks on this subject from time to time and about the ""shame"" he felt before starting the band.  He always wanted a better life for his own family someday and has now found the opportunity to achieve just that.

Their very country family hosts a cast of characters that easily makes this film more enjoyable to watch repeatedly.  Set to Kings Of Leon's family musings in the background, you really couldn't wish for a more atmospheric place to be. That family reunion, where everyone is just a 'plain ole' me looks like a great amount of fun to attend.  Yes, an  excess of some things of the whole rock and roll life, although that is seen everywhere not just here in these families.

Along with the familiar story itself are the paralleled packed stadiums that the band is performing in.  Lots of backstage antics, much-expected rebellion from the Followills and song after song in their writing and rehearsal stages. The documentary has a definite personal stamp right on it and plays with people who are either a fan or not, it's just that well done.  This band is tight, cohesive but first and foremost, this band is family.",1347408000,2,3333,4.832746478873239
4718076,3,B005KP74RW,"I knew a bit of the Kings of Leon story prior to seeing this documentary.  As a film, it works really well . . . remains interesting and enlightening throughout.  But it's also a frustrating exercise as one can easily see that substance abuse WILL (not may, WILL) be the downfall of the young musicians.  There's a reason so much of their family has remained poor.  And if these guys don't change, they'll end up right back there with them, or worse.  In interviews, the guys seem pretty self aware, but in fact their totally blind to their enslavement to alcohol.  That's frustrating to see.",1341964800,2,592,4.59047619047619
