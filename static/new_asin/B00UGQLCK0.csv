7039265,5,B00UGQLCK0,"Great collection for Perry Mason fans, especially for those who enjoy classic movies.. The movies show a range of interesting character interpretations by different actors--""serious lawyer"" to ""a lawyer with flair"" to ""superstar lawyer."" Entertaining and fun to watch. And to collect.",1357084800,2,284,5.785714285714286
7039266,5,B00UGQLCK0,I really enjoyed this set  I've seen these on TV and wanted to have my own so I can watch at any time.,1356739200,15,102,3.4347826086956523
7039267,5,B00UGQLCK0,Anyone that is an old movie buff will love these movies. I love Warren William and he is so good as the original Perry Mason. I have been waiting a long time for these to come out and they are great. You cannot go wrong with them or The Saint or The Falcon. They have also been a long time coming but thank goodness they are coming out with the old movies and the stars. This is indeed a great gift for people that have everything and you just do not know what to get them.,1355961600,3,473,3.9375
7039268,5,B00UGQLCK0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this collection.  The ones with Warren Williams were fine but got even better with the entry by Ricardo Cortez or Donald Wood. I liked the good condition of the video as well.  WB did a good job, no frills, but good.  I have 4 WB original type mystery/detective collections and this one does not disappoint. I feel it was worth this price though did miss the special feature part some WB movies have in the 'Night at the Movies' offerings, just having the movies was fine.  I am  waiting for more WB collection movies to come on to the market, or maybe hoping they will release more soon",1355875200,2,608,4.441441441441442
7039269,4,B00UGQLCK0,"Watching this set of Perry Masons after years of watching Raymond Burr in the role may be unfair to these earlier efforts, since I have an expectation of how a Perry Mason should go. But I came to enjoy most of the movies, hence four stars out of five. Warren William stars in the first four movies in the set of six. In THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG he defends the great Mary Astor and this movie alone would make the set worth it. I had read this mystery before and knew how it would go, but it was fun to see it on film. In THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE, Michael Curtiz directs and Errol Flynn has a small non-speaking part. This is another good mystery. I found it disconcerting to have a new actress playing Della Street in almost every film, since each actress brought her own personality to the part and changed Della significantly. Side kicks were changed as well, some better than others. Sets also go from very elaborate in DOG to a two room office in BISHOP. I suppose there was enough time between films for original audiences to forget or not care, but watching them back-to-back the differences were sometimes glaring.

Now we get to the second disc and the next two movies (THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS and THE CASE OF THE VELVET CLAWS) where everything starts to go downhill. Warren William, who was known for playing villains with a heart of stone, begins to overact and show signs of Perry having a drinking problem, characters seem two-dimensional and plots go out the window with holes in them just as big. If the other films were like these I would sell the set.

But no! The third disc turns things around again. Ricardo Cortez plays Perry Mason in THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT. I've always liked Ricardo Cortez - see CHARLIE CHAN OVER NEW YORK. And he plays a likeable Perry without all the eccentricities. This is a good mystery which makes sense and closes plot points nicely, but has all the twists you could want, including court room drama. I would have loved to see Ricardo Cortez in all six of these movies - ah, if you could turn back time. The only problem in this movie is that for some reason the cat is not black but a tortoise-shell, which for a cat lover like me was a problem. Anyway, the cat plays a significant part, just as the howling dog did in the first movie, and may even get more screen time than the dog did.

The last movie, THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP, changes Perrys again, this time to Donald Woods, another likeable, believable Perry. As in BLACK CAT we see Paul Drake and Hamilton Burger but this movie starts toward the familiar characters of the TV series and there is good court room drama. Another good mystery with a satisfying resolution.

I've never seen an old mystery set that came back to quality work after starting to slide to the bottom - the Falcon mysteries are a case in point, losing George Sanders as the Falcon and replacing him with Tom Conway?!! (even if he was Sanders' brother). So I was pleasantly surprised with this set - four good movies out of six is not bad. For four dollars and change per movie, this set is a good buy.",1354147200,64,3103,4.381944444444445
7039270,4,B00UGQLCK0,"Probably due to resurging interest in the career of Pre-Code film star Warren William, and the wonderful recently published biography,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-William-Magnificent-Scoundrel-of-Pre-Code-Hollywood/dp/0786448784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren William: Magnificent Scoundrel of Pre-Code Hollywood</a>, Warner Archives have released all six Warner Brothers PERRY MASON series films, the initial four featuring Warren William in the titular role, followed by Ricardo Cortez and Donald Woods.  Coincidentally, Ricardo Cortez played the first incarnation of detective Sam Spade in 1931's THE MALTESE FALCON, followed by Warren (as ""Michael Shayne"") in the 1936 adaption SATAN MET A LADY (both can be found in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-MALTESE-FALCON-3-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000GIXLW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE MALTESE FALCON 3 Disc Special Edition</a>).  Unfortunately, but expected, Warner's have not Remastered or cleaned-up any of the film prints.  Individual quality will be mentioned in each film's separate reviews.  At least they put two films on three separate discs, and not on those horrible two-sided monstrosities. Each disc has it's own tray and hub as well, unlike Sony's insane 3DVD'S-on-one-spindle cases!

THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG (1934) was Warner's initial Perry Mason offering, and they pull out all ballyhoo stops in the included trailer.  The story by Erle Stanley Gardner was initially published in installments in LOOK Magazine, and became a sensation.  The film's ""A"" production values are rendered moot by the scratchy, speckled and spliced transfer.  Luckily the story and acting are first rate. We are first introduced to Perry Mason by establishing shots of his many stenciled office windows, personal switchboard operators, large opulent offices and vignettes of clients complaining to his bevy of specialty lawyers because they cannot be personally represented by Mason himself.  The case/mystery involves an extremely nervous client wanting advice on how to remove a neighbors howling dog while suspiciously presenting scenarios that might impact a will he wants to write.  At first skeptical, Mason quickly changes his mind when the client leaves a $10,000 retainer on his desk before he disappears.  With a supporting cast that includes Mary Astor, Allen Jenkins, Grant Mitchell and Helen Trenholme as Della Street, THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG is a fine little mystery film, and is anchored by a strong commanding believable performance by Warren William ......

THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE (1935) The second in the series and the last given an ""A"" budget, also benefits from the direction of the famous Michael Curtiz  (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, CASABLANCA, MILDRED PIERCE and on and on).  Labeled a ""Clue Club Selection"" in the opening credits (one of only 12 films that received that moniker*), the print is slightly better this go-round, with occasional crystal clear segments that make the just passable bulk more maddening!  The film is also famous for containing the American debut of Errol Flynn in a small but pivotal role. Ironically, it was Warner's casting of Flynn as the lead in CAPTAIN BLOOD not long afterward, a role they had previously promised William to mollify him during contract negotiations, that caused Warren to sour on the studio and eventually find a way to end his contract.  Strangely, the script of the film changes the tone of Mason's portrayal, making him additionally a well-known and somewhat obsessive gastronome, who even has a gourmet meal delivered to the jail when he is having a conference with his imprisoned client!  When dinner with his assistants and coroner Wilbur Strong (Olin Howland) is interrupted, they even take their desert coffee AND samovar to the morgue, in what may be the first in a long line of ""eating at the autopsy"" film scenes (although here they only find a McGuffin in the coffin). An enjoyable contemporary Trailer is also included.  With Margaret Lindsay (a staple of 1930's and 1940's whodunits) as the titular BRIDE, and again supported by many Warner stock-players, Allen Jenkins (as Mason's investigator ""Spudsy""), Barton MacLane, Donald Woods (who'll get his chance in the sixth entry) and Claire Dodd (replacing Trenholme as Della Street), THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE benefits greatly from Warren William's ability to seamlessly meld the serious and comedic elements into a believable characterization......

THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS (1935) Directed by Warner stalwart Archie Mayo (SVENGALI, THE PETRIFIED FOREST, A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA), the film's convoluted plot concerns the murder a con-artist impersonating a hosiery company representative who goes from town to town promoting ""Lucky Legs"" contests with a $1000 prize, paid in part by the department store and town convinced to sponsor it.  The lucky leggy winners never receive the prize money, since he skips town afterward, bilking everyone for his board, promotional costs, and of course the $1000 prize.  Perry Mason's characterization also undergoes another tone shift, this time the brilliant attorney is also a wise-cracking borderline alcoholic! The only allusion to the previous film's gastronomic angle is when his physician, Dr. Croker (played by the last film's coroner, Olin Howland) tells Perry he needs to lay off the rich food besides the booze.  There are also more comedic elements in scenes, like Mason's client Bradbury (Porter Hall) finding him ""sleeping it off"" behind his office desk, his ""raiding of the icebox"" while questioning two of the contestants, the milking of his new predilection for milk (sorry!) and the constant running banter with everyone, especially his fellow wise-cracking secretary Della Street, this time played by Genevieve Tobin, who could pass as Gracie Allen's slightly-smarter sister!  From the previous flick, Allen Jenkins returns as Mason's investigator ""Spudsy"" as does Barton MacLane, again in a thankless policeman role.  Also featured are Paticia Ellis as the the prize-winner ""whose brains are below her knees"" (according to the trailer, not me), Lyle Talbot as her jealous doctor boyfriend and Three Stooges foil Bud Jamison as a sarcastic bartender!  Picture quality is the most consistent yet, unfortunately that also goes for the scratches and speckles.  THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS clips along at a breezy pace, with the usual double-crosses, red herrings and ulterior motives spiced with snappy dialog and the occasional non sequitur.  To again quote the trailer, it's ""First Nationals Melodramatic Comedy"" and ""A Rib-Tickling Warner Bros. & Vitaphone Hit!""  The customary ending denouement occurs with every character who's still alive in Mason's office while he undergoes a physical examination!  A most enjoyable slick little ""B"" programmer whose 77 minutes fly by......

THE CASE OF THE VELVET CLAWS (1936) The 4th and last Perry Mason film (and another ""Clue Club Selection"") starring Warren William  begins with Perry marrying his long-suffering secretary Della Street (portrayed again by Claire Dodd from the second series entry).  After being driven to their hotel by Mason's sidekick Spudsy Drake (Eddie Acuff replacing Alan Jenkins), the plot is set in motion when Perry is kidnapped from his honeymoon suite by Eva Belter (Winifred Shaw), a conniving femme fatale (who would give Mary Astor's Brigid in THE MALTESE FALCON a run for her money) who demands his help to avoid a scandal. From there on it's a convoluted mixture of murders, lies, set-ups, blackmail, and sleeping tablets in warm milk!  Della is none too pleased with her continually interrupted honeymoon either, especially when Perry is accused of murder.  He also has a scandal sheet, ""Spicy Bits,"" breathing down his neck. Olan Howland makes his 3rd appearance, this time back as coroner Wilbur Strong who's also Perry's doctor!  Pedestrianly directed by William Clemens (THE NANCY DREW SERIES, THE FALCON SERIES) on a ""B"" budget, William's portrayal is more in line with the first film, with less comedic sidetracks, although we get Spudsy in drag at one point and enough snappy banter to keep your interest from waning.  This time the denouement occurs with everyone on their way to the courthouse so Perry can stop fed-up Della's petition for an annulment!  The picture quality is again clear and focused, including the scratches and speckles.  Another contemporary Trailer is included.

THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT (1936) The film series' 5th installment is much closer in tone to the famous long-running television series than the previous four!  Ricardo Cortez delivers a strong performance, portraying the super-sleuth attorney as a more serious and believable character, whose vices aren't gourmet food or good liquor, but crossword puzzles and waffles! June Travis as Perry's secretary Della Street is a confident confidant and trusted gate-keeper, with nary a mention of their marriage from the last film. Besides their obvious affection for each other and the usual snappy banter, the only hint of romance comes from a bit of innuendo at the end.  Also, Perry's investigator and ""right-hand"" (Gary Owen)is finally referred to as Paul Drake, and in the picture's courtroom finale, Perry has to match wits with District Attorney Hamilton Burger (Guy Usher). The plot revolves around wealthy curmudgeon Peter Laxter, portrayed by the film's only well-known face, the delightful character actor Harry Davenport (GONE WITH THE WIND, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, KINGS ROW, and 160 others!), his will changes, greedy relatives and the caretaker's pet cat Clinker.  A decent little mystery with a bevy of suspects, a convoluted plot that keeps you guessing, and a breezy 66 minute run time that doesn't give you a chance to get bored, what else could you ask for?  The picture quality is the best yet, very clear and focused with less scratches and speckles, probably since it's elements haven't undergone much usage! The included Trailer states that the story was originally serialized in Liberty Magazine and is trumpeted as another ""Clue Club Of The Month"" offering.  Going in with admittedly lowered expectations, I found THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT to be an surprisingly entertaining little gem......

THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP (1937) First National/Warner Brother's sixth and final Perry Mason series entry stars Donald Woods as Mason. Wood's prolific career included over 200 film and television roles.  The cast's most famous face, Ann Dvorak (SCARFACE, THREE ON A MATCH, FLAME OF BARBARY COAST) stars as the fifth Della Street. Coincidentally, Dvorak also co-starred with Warren William in three films, including his last, THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI in 1947. Mason's private investigator Paul Drake is played (sometimes for comic relief) by another prolific actor, Joseph Crehan, whose 350 credits included the distinction of portraying President/General Ulysses S. Grant nine times. Frank Faylen (IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS) also has a small supporting role. Helmed by VELVET CLAWS director William Clemens, this mystery concerns an Australian Bishop (Edward McWade) who wants Perry to help right a wrong involving an heir to a millionaire's fortune given up for adoption twenty years beforehand. With the help of Della, Drake and bumbling hotel detective McGooney (occasional Three Stooges' foil Tom Kennedy, Perry sorts out the fake identities, red herrings, half-truths and lies, along with solving the millionaire's murder and ties them up in a neat bow for District Attorney Hamilton Burger (Charles Wilson, in his 3rd MASON series appearance) by the last reel.  The picture is watchable, but in rougher shape than those proceeding.  The is no trailer. Although not as lively as the Warren William entries, THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP is another enjoyable ""B"" programmer, and ends the series admirably......

Obviously this set won't interest everyone, but is a boon to fans of Warren William and anyone enamored with 1930's and 40's black & white detective mysteries. The PERRY MASON series, along with a multitude of others, PHILO VANCE**, THE FALCON, THE THIN MAN, MR. WU, CHARLIE CHAN, MR. MOTO, THE LONE WOLF**, THE SAINT, SHERLOCK HOLMES, DICK TRACY, BULLDOG DRUMMOND, even NANCY DREW to name a few, were very popular during that time period and entertained movie audiences as well as radio listeners.  The original novels and the magazines that serialized them or published original stories also sold quite well. I'm sure there will be the usual complaints from customers about the companies releasing them on CD-R's without any remastering, but at least they're now available, and in better quality than shady bootlegs or horrible public domain prints. With many of the above series being now released here and there it seems the studios are beginning to realize that the market is out there, as they have with the many noir films now available separately or in sets. Let's hope the trickle turns into a flood......

*Starting around 1935, Warner Brothers/First National began releasing a series of mystery films in association with Joseph Shaw's BLACK MASK MAGAZINE under the ""Clue Club"" banner. Youngsters could join and receive a Clue Club card that would give them a chance to win prizes by going to see the pictures. (Thanx to JUST A CINEAST and NitrateVille!)

7039271,5,B00UGQLCK0,"Warren William is just fantastic in the role of Perry Mason and gives the character quite a different spin than Raymond Burr, whom I grew up watching. Some are put off by his portrayal of the lawyer but I found it quite an amusing take on the role. I never thought I would enjoy a drunkard Perry Mason (The Case of the Lucky Legs) but William pulls it off somehow and it ends up my favorite next to The Case Of The  Howling Dog. The other actors who take over the Mason role in the final two films are fine and both Cortez and Woods give workmanlike performances but I enjoy the Warren William lot the most. Ann Dvorack is outstanding and quite amusing as Della Street in The Case Of The Stuttering Bishop as well.",1522195200,3,714,4.25

7039274,4,B00UGQLCK0,"Actually an excellent set for Perry Mason fans.  The movies themselves vary from really enjoyable to pretty awful.  The Warren William movies start out fair to poor. Personally, I liked the last two: The Case of the Black Cat and The Case of the Stuttering Bishop.  Both movies included characters from the books unlike the Warren William movies and the plots stuck pretty close to the two novels.  Stuttering Bishop even uses actual dialog from the novel, which I'm reading at the present time.  Of course, all of us know that Raymond Burr will forever be immortalized as the REAL Perry Mason!",1514851200,2,594,4.784313725490196

7039277,3,B00UGQLCK0,"I ordered this out of curiosity, having read that author Erle Stanley Gardner didn't care for these film adaptations.  It's easy to see why.  On television, Mason, Street and Drake were presented as smart, hard-working professionals.  The films were made in the style of the era: wise-cracking hero, backed up by a plucky female companion.  Perhaps worst of all, private detective Paul Drake becomes semi-comic relief Spudy Drake.  Also typical of the era, the police weren't very bright.

One interesting bit of trivia:  Two of the actors playing Perry Mason - Warren William, and Ricardo Cortez - played Sam Spade in the first two versions of the Maltese Falcon (The Bogart version was a remake).",1508284800,,698,5.017391304347826

Coincidentally, Ricardo Cortez played the first incarnation of detective Sam Spade in 1931's THE MALTESE FALCON, followed by Warren (as ""Michael Shayne"") in the 1936 adaption SATAN MET A LADY (both can be found in THE MALTESE FALCON 3 Disc Special Edition).

With a supporting cast that includes Mary Astor, Allen Jenkins, Grant Mitchell and Helen Trenholme as Della Street, THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG is a fine little mystery film, and is anchored by a strong commanding believable performance by Warren William ......

THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE (1935) The second in the series and the last given an ""A"" budget, also benefits from the direction of the famous Michael Curtiz (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, CASABLANCA, MILDRED PIERCE and on and on). Labeled a ""Clue Club Selection"" in the opening credits (one of only 12 films that received that moniker*), the print is slightly better this go-round, with occasional crystal clear segments that make the just passable bulk more maddening! The film is also famous for containing the American debut of Errol Flynn in a small but pivotal role. Ironically, it was Warner's casting of Flynn as the lead in CAPTAIN BLOOD not long afterward, a role they had previously promised William to mollify him during contract negotiations, that caused Warren to sour on the studio and eventually find a way to end his contract. Strangely, the script of the film changes the tone of Mason's portrayal, making him additionally a well-known and somewhat obsessive gastronome, who even has a gourmet meal delivered to the jail when he is having a conference with his imprisoned client! When dinner with his assistants and coroner Wilbur Strong (Olin Howland) is interrupted, they even take their desert coffee AND samovar to the morgue, in what may be the first in a long line of ""eating at the autopsy"" film scenes (although here they only find a McGuffin in the coffin). An enjoyable contemporary Trailer is also included. With Margaret Lindsay (a staple of 1930's and 1940's whodunits) as the titular BRIDE, and again supported by many Warner stock-players, Allen Jenkins (as Mason's investigator ""Spudsy""), Barton MacLane, Donald Woods (who'll get his chance in the sixth entry) and Claire Dodd (replacing Trenholme as Della Street), THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE benefits greatly from Warren William's ability to seamlessly meld the serious and comedic elements into a believable characterization......

THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS (1935) Directed by Warner stalwart Archie Mayo (SVENGALI, THE PETRIFIED FOREST, A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA), the film's convoluted plot concerns the murder a con-artist impersonating a hosiery company representative who goes from town to town promoting ""Lucky Legs"" contests with a $1000 prize, paid in part by the department store and town convinced to sponsor it. The lucky leggy winners never receive the prize money, since he skips town afterward, bilking everyone for his board, promotional costs, and of course the $1000 prize. Perry Mason's characterization also undergoes another tone shift, this time the brilliant attorney is also a wise-cracking borderline alcoholic! The only allusion to the previous film's gastronomic angle is when his physician, Dr. Croker (played by the last film's coroner, Olin Howland) tells Perry he needs to lay off the rich food besides the booze. There are also more comedic elements in scenes, like Mason's client Bradbury (Porter Hall) finding him ""sleeping it off"" behind his office desk, his ""raiding of the icebox"" while questioning two of the contestants, the milking of his new predilection for milk (sorry!) and the constant running banter with everyone, especially his fellow wise-cracking secretary Della Street, this time played by Genevieve Tobin, who could pass as Gracie Allen's slightly-smarter sister! From the previous flick, Allen Jenkins returns as Mason's investigator ""Spudsy"" as does Barton MacLane, again in a thankless policeman role. Also featured are Paticia Ellis as the the prize-winner ""whose brains are below her knees"" (according to the trailer, not me), Lyle Talbot as her jealous doctor boyfriend and Three Stooges foil Bud Jamison as a sarcastic bartender! Picture quality is the most consistent yet, unfortunately that also goes for the scratches and speckles. THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS clips along at a breezy pace, with the usual double-crosses, red herrings and ulterior motives spiced with snappy dialog and the occasional non sequitur. To again quote the trailer, it's ""First Nationals Melodramatic Comedy"" and ""A Rib-Tickling Warner Bros. & Vitaphone Hit!"" The customary ending denouement occurs with every character who's still alive in Mason's office while he undergoes a physical examination! A most enjoyable slick little ""B"" programmer whose 77 minutes fly by......

THE CASE OF THE VELVET CLAWS (1936) The 4th and last Perry Mason film (and another ""Clue Club Selection"") starring Warren William begins with Perry marrying his long-suffering secretary Della Street (portrayed again by Claire Dodd from the second series entry). After being driven to their hotel by Mason's sidekick Spudsy Drake (Eddie Acuff replacing Alan Jenkins), the plot is set in motion when Perry is kidnapped from his honeymoon suite by Eva Belter (Winifred Shaw), a conniving femme fatale (who would give Mary Astor's Brigid in THE MALTESE FALCON a run for her money) who demands his help to avoid a scandal. From there on it's a convoluted mixture of murders, lies, set-ups, blackmail, and sleeping tablets in warm milk! Della is none too pleased with her continually interrupted honeymoon either, especially when Perry is accused of murder. He also has a scandal sheet, ""Spicy Bits,"" breathing down his neck. Olan Howland makes his 3rd appearance, this time back as coroner Wilbur Strong who's also Perry's doctor! Pedestrianly directed by William Clemens (THE NANCY DREW SERIES, THE FALCON SERIES) on a ""B"" budget, William's portrayal is more in line with the first film, with less comedic sidetracks, although we get Spudsy in drag at one point and enough snappy banter to keep your interest from waning. This time the denouement occurs with everyone on their way to the courthouse so Perry can stop fed-up Della's petition for an annulment! The picture quality is again clear and focused, including the scratches and speckles. Another contemporary Trailer is included.

THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT (1936) The film series' 5th installment is much closer in tone to the famous long-running television series than the previous four! Ricardo Cortez delivers a strong performance, portraying the super-sleuth attorney as a more serious and believable character, whose vices aren't gourmet food or good liquor, but crossword puzzles and waffles! June Travis as Perry's secretary Della Street is a confident confidant and trusted gate-keeper, with nary a mention of their marriage from the last film. Besides their obvious affection for each other and the usual snappy banter, the only hint of romance comes from a bit of innuendo at the end. Also, Perry's investigator and ""right-hand"" (Gary Owen)is finally referred to as Paul Drake, and in the picture's courtroom finale, Perry has to match wits with District Attorney Hamilton Burger (Guy Usher). The plot revolves around wealthy curmudgeon Peter Laxter, portrayed by the film's only well-known face, the delightful character actor Harry Davenport (GONE WITH THE WIND, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, KINGS ROW, and 160 others!), his will changes, greedy relatives and the caretaker's pet cat Clinker. A decent little mystery with a bevy of suspects, a convoluted plot that keeps you guessing, and a breezy 66 minute run time that doesn't give you a chance to get bored, what else could you ask for? The picture quality is the best yet, very clear and focused with less scratches and speckles, probably since it's elements haven't undergone much usage! The included Trailer states that the story was originally serialized in Liberty Magazine and is trumpeted as another ""Clue Club Of The Month"" offering. Going in with admittedly lowered expectations, I found THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT to be an surprisingly entertaining little gem......

THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP (1937) First National/Warner Brother's sixth and final Perry Mason series entry stars Donald Woods as Mason. Wood's prolific career included over 200 film and television roles. The cast's most famous face, Ann Dvorak (SCARFACE, THREE ON A MATCH, FLAME OF BARBARY COAST) stars as the fifth Della Street. Coincidentally, Dvorak also co-starred with Warren William in three films, including his last, THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI in 1947. Mason's private investigator Paul Drake is played (sometimes for comic relief) by another prolific actor, Joseph Crehan, whose 350 credits included the distinction of portraying President/General Ulysses S. Grant nine times. Frank Faylen (IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS) also has a small supporting role. Helmed by VELVET CLAWS director William Clemens, this mystery concerns an Australian Bishop (Edward McWade) who wants Perry to help right a wrong involving an heir to a millionaire's fortune given up for adoption twenty years beforehand. With the help of Della, Drake and bumbling hotel detective McGooney (occasional Three Stooges' foil Tom Kennedy, Perry sorts out the fake identities, red herrings, half-truths and lies, along with solving the millionaire's murder and ties them up in a neat bow for District Attorney Hamilton Burger (Charles Wilson, in his 3rd MASON series appearance) by the last reel. The picture is watchable, but in rougher shape than those proceeding. The is no trailer. Although not as lively as the Warren William entries, THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP is another enjoyable ""B"" programmer, and ends the series admirably......

Obviously this set won't interest everyone, but is a boon to fans of Warren William and anyone enamored with 1930's and 40's black & white detective mysteries. The PERRY MASON series, along with a multitude of others, PHILO VANCE**, THE FALCON, THE THIN MAN, MR. WU, CHARLIE CHAN, MR. MOTO, THE LONE WOLF**, THE SAINT, SHERLOCK HOLMES, DICK TRACY, BULLDOG DRUMMOND, even NANCY DREW to name a few, were very popular during that time period and entertained movie audiences as well as radio listeners. The original novels and the magazines that serialized them or published original stories also sold quite well. I'm sure there will be the usual complaints from customers about the companies releasing them on CD-R's without any remastering, but at least they're now available, and in better quality than shady bootlegs or horrible public domain prints. With many of the above series being now released here and there it seems the studios are beginning to realize that the market is out there, as they have with the many noir films now available separately or in sets. Let's hope the trickle turns into a flood......

*Starting around 1935, Warner Brothers/First National began releasing a series of mystery films in association with Joseph Shaw's BLACK MASK MAGAZINE under the ""Clue Club"" banner. Youngsters could join and receive a Clue Club card that would give them a chance to win prizes by going to see the pictures. (Thanx to JUST A CINEAST and NitrateVille!)

7039301,2,B00UGQLCK0,"Frankly, the only good one is the first one, ""The Case of the Howling Dog"".  It comes closest to the Mason novel.  Warren  Williams, who had a tendency toward hamminess, is kept in check here and he gives a strong performance as Mason in this one, coming closer to the Mason of the novels than even Raymond Burr in the television series.  Williams  next three were attempts at comedy that just didn't work.  Ricardo Cortez took over in ""The Case of the Black Cat"", followed by Donald Woods in ""The Case of the Stuttering Bishop"", after which Earl  Stanley  Gardner pulled the plug on the series in disgust with Warner Brothers treatment of the Mason character.  These films are at best curiosities  and can be enjoyed as such, but don't expect to see Perry  Mason,  or even a good mystery.  Was fun to see Errol Flynn as the murder victim in ""The Case of the Curious Bride""though.",1457827200,5,880,4.528662420382165

7039303,5,B00UGQLCK0,This DVD has a collection of pre Raymond Burr Perry Mason movies. Fascinating to see the variety of takes on Perry's character from fast talking nonsense to sober straight gum shoe type.  More actresses portrayed different takes on Della Street for the same Perry. Dallas ranged from tough broad to tender ingenue. One of them married Perry and insisted he stop working.  Of course he didn't and she filed for divorce the same day. In one version Paul Drake was a smaller man and wore sweats. He apparently operated from a gym and had rather slangy dialogue.  Raymond Burr's Perry is in a class by itself.,1447459200,,605,4.688679245283019

Warren William is really good and is clearly having lots of fun in the title role.  His Perry Mason is far more eccentric and energetic than the plodding Perry Mason of Raymond Burr.  The Warren William films are the best, but the other three are also entertaining.

But the Raymond Burrs from TV were closer to the books, but still noticeably altered as well, and changed the plot and characters when the book's name was reused. [e.g., In the books, once in or twice Mason used his fists. In the books and TV, Mason never got drunk, let alone spent the night sleeping on the floor of his office.] They are entertaining and include some of the use of wits Erle Stanley Gardner put into the original works.",1424476800,,681,4.5

As the episodes progressed and Warren William, who played Perry as carefree and devil may care, the stories and mysteries got better and by the time the last episode with a more mature Perry and lovely Della, who was lovely and played by different actresses in the previous episodes, mysteries were more involved and well written and made the viewer really into who was the villain.

7039336,4,B00UGQLCK0,"These are all quickie films meant as the second feature on a two movie bill. As such, one should judge them  by standards other than those one would use for the main features, on which far more money, directing skill, and production values were expended
In these terms, particularly good were the ones starring Warren William and Ricardo Cortez. William was, as always, first rate, Cortez, as usual, speaking with the kind of precision of speech common to those for whom overcoming their native New Yorkese has been a problem, is a bit less effective, but still, good, indeed. Both had done well in  feature pictures;  I have no idea why they did not continue making those along with the second raters, as did such major feature co-stars as Edward Arnold. In those days, they were all contract players, popular though they may have been, and did as the studio ordered.
All the films are adapted from Perry Mason novels by Gardner, these early ones star a Mason less suave than the one of his later books and, certainly, less polished than either of the very popular TV series starring Raymond Burr. To fit into the allotted hour plus a few minutes and the requirements of the actors available, the stories in the films are much simplified and condensed. A lightness of tone is also imposed to provide relief from the seriousness often found in the main feature (among a number of reasons).
All in all, all of these brief movies provide a welcome contrast to current fare on your evening's TV program and are a nice way to complete the viewing day. Some of us get the additional pleasure of remembering when we first saw these actors and films in the days before television replaced radio and the movie house as our twin entertainment center.",1410480000,,1741,4.683006535947713

7039350,5,B00UGQLCK0,"the first thing to say is that you don't have to tell me that Raymond Burr IS Perry Mason. like so many i grew up on the reruns and got my first inkling just how the law works from this landmark series. and of course it remains the greatest law drama in television history. (and second-greatest law-related series in general, just behind Night Court.)
what's so easy for people to forget is that ""definitive"" means best, not only. just because Christopher Reeve is the definitive Superman doesn't invalidate Kirk Alyn or George Reeves in the least. the definitive James Bond is unquestionably Roger Moore, but that didn't stop Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig from having (and providing) some fun with the role. nor does Raymond Burr's dominance of literature's greatest attorney keep the three actors showcased here from making their own spin on the part work in their own way.
most memorable of the three Perrys herein (at least partly because he's the only to play the part more than once) is ""Pre-Code King"" Warren William. (basically, that means that he was Hollywood's biggest star in the years immediately preceding the institution of the Breen Office and their ""decency"" nitpicking.) granted, William doesn't quite tower in the role as Burr would, but nonetheless does have a handle on the role as well as the personal magnetism to command the screen. it could be argued that he has essentially the same ""interpretation"" as Burr, differing only in the physiognomy department.
if you're one of those purist prudes who demands absolutely rigid adherence to source material, you'll be most satisfied with episode 1, THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG. what could've been a simple connect-the-dots cashing in on a literary phenomenon turns out to be a snazzy bit of film noir with respect as well as love for it's blueprint. it captures much of Erle Stanley Gardner's literary atmosphere and style with aplomb, although curiously, DOG is the only Warren William installment where the denouement takes place in trial.
the feel shifts slightly for THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE and THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS. while they don't exactly distort the basic sequences of events in their respective books, they introduce an element of ""screwball"" comedy into the mix. indeed, the relationship between Mason and his secretary, Della Street, begins to resemble that of Nick and Nora Charles in the Thin Man movies. (comes to think of it, Warren William does have a certain William Powell quality.) as a comedy fan i don't have a problem with this, especially as it manages not to step on the toes of the suspense. (BRIDE was directed by Michael ""Casablanca"" Curtiz, and it doesn't exactly suffer for it.)
it could be argued, however, that the comedy is kicked up too much of a notch for THE CASE OF THE VELVET CLAWS, Warren William's final performance. (ironically, based upon the very first of Erle Stanley Gardner's novels.) a whole new subplot finds Perry and Della getting married (yes, you read that right). the union is strained as Mason, who's promised to give up criminal law, gets repeatedly drawn into the case. as far as the book's case of a scandal-sheet publisher goes, the film is as faithful as it's limited time spent on the matter will permit. nor, strictly speaking, is the aforementioned farce element lacking in laughs. but even so, it's an uneven mix.
whether that has anything to do with William's departure is more than i can say, but it is noteworthy that the series begins to more closely resemble the flavor of the tv series from there on. first, one Ricardo Cortez takes up the law office for THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT. (based on the book The Case Of The Caretaker's Cat. why the prosaic new title? your guess is as good as mine.) Cortez might seem a bit young for the role, but he gets the job done.
finally, one Donald Woods (whom we'd previously seem in THE CURIOUS BRIDE) handles what would turn out to be the series' ""last hurrah,"" THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP. again, the result is passable if hardly earthshaking. the only major nit to be picked here is that the supposedly Australian cleric in question has the most American sounding Australian accent I've ever heard in my life.
why the series is discontinued at this point is for anyone to surmise. did box-office receipts fall off with the loss of Warren William? did they themselves feel their attempts to replace him had failed? who knows? but hey, six installments is plenty for any film franchise, right?
if i have any grievance with this otherwise exemplary B-movie franchise, it's that Mason's redoubtable ""man Friday"" gets the shaft. in the books as well as Burr's tv series, detective Paul Drake is as reliable, no-nonsense a right-hand man as anyone could ever ask for. as written by Gardner or played by William Hopper, he's a more than worthy Watson to Perry Mason's Sherlock. here, however, the character is distorted into a comic-relief goofball first referred to as ""Spudsy"" Drake. later, presumably a half-assed attempt at a compromise, he's called Paul and even smartened up just a tad, but alas, resemblance to the character designed by Gardner remains, as the saying goes, purely coincidental.
but that aside, what we have here is an impressive specimen of the B-movie art. quality level may fluctuate, but then it always does when there's multiple episodes. overall, this is an interesting companion piece to Gardner's novels and Burr's tv show, as well as good fun in it's own right.",1396569600,5,5499,4.844845908607864

7039353,4,B00UGQLCK0,What I've learnt is that if Warren William is lead in a 30s movie then it's going to be darn good.  The movies where Warren William plays Mason are excellent.  Even better that does not play the character the same in each movie.  There are other movies here where other actors play Mason as sadly they pale in comparison.,1389398400,,321,4.406779661016949

This version depicted Perry Mason in an active high strung manner while displaying a kind of rakish attitude, but in the end, he still got the job done.  Guess this version set the stage for the later version, starring Raymond Burr, which I  like better.

7039360,5,B00UGQLCK0,"I'm giving this set 5* despite the fact that not all the entries from this Perry Mason fun fest are equal in quality. I totally love the urbane Warren William as the equally urbane and sneaky smart Perry Mason and have to concede that Ricardo Cortez manages to pick up the Mason gauntlet with panache and style. Donald Woods? Not exactly as suave as William or Cortez, but an interesting play on the Mason character who you always know is going to nail the case and outsmart the so-called experts.
I love these films from the '30's and they feature some really fine character actors that were often part of the Warner Brothers stock company.
If you love Earle Stanley Gardner and his hawk eyed attorney who has a penchant for solving crimes, this is a cool collection.  While not remastered or cleaned up in any way, this stands in contrast to the tv series which had Perry Mason trumping the opposition. I liked the tv series and watch it with great regularity, but I have a soft spot for Warren William and the other Masons.",1384646400,,1026,4.516129032258065

7039372,4,B00UGQLCK0,"I consider these movies as the ground work for the TV series.  There are some similarities but many differences.  Each movie has its own merits and distractions.  Yet there is underlining current, a persona, that flows through to the TV series.  I won't go into details about each of the 6 movies because others have done a great job of this and are very accurate.  There is the Law Firm angle.  There is the comedy angle.  There is walking close to the breaking the law angle.  Some were even recreated in the TV series.  One difference is the movies are from the 1930's American society view while the TV series is a portrayal of the 1950's society with the right/wrong, need a confession focus.  All of them have the lawyer, Perry Mason, the secretary, Dela Street, and a very needful Detective that provides a variety of needful supporting roles both for the actors and for the story lines.  Eventually the name Paul Drake comes out which eventually in the TV series becomes an agency as well as the person.

The movies do not dictate the TV series, but it provides some groundwork on the evolution of this famous lawyer.  You don't need to watch the movies to appreciate the TV series, but it does provide a much grander interpretation of this person called Perry Mason.",1366502400,,1275,4.613333333333333
7039373,4,B00UGQLCK0,"The packaging is misleading in that Warren William is displayed on the cover, so you'd think he is the star in all 6 Perry Mason films. He is not. He stars in four. ""Case of the Black Cat"" stars Ricardo Cortez who has his own kind of debonair charm and wittiness, and it is a good entry. The last of the series ""Case of the Stuttering Bishop"" is the most confusing and stars Donald Woods as Perry Mason and Anne Dvorak as Della Street. This last film has no implied romance between Perry and Della.

I'd recommend this one - the transfers are beautiful - just don't expect the wonderful Mr. William to be Perry Mason in each and every film.",1365897600,3,640,4.289256198347108
7039374,4,B00UGQLCK0,"Probably due to resurging interest in the career of Pre-Code film star Warren William, and the wonderful recently published biography,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warren-William-Magnificent-Scoundrel-of-Pre-Code-Hollywood/dp/0786448784/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warren William: Magnificent Scoundrel of Pre-Code Hollywood</a>, Warner Archives have released all six Warner Brothers PERRY MASON series films, the initial four featuring Warren William in the titular role, followed by Ricardo Cortez and Donald Woods.

Unfortunately, but expected, Warner's have not Remastered or cleaned-up any of the film prints.  Individual quality will be mentioned in each film's separate reviews.  At least they put two films on three separate discs, and not on those horrible two-sided monstrosities. Each disc has it's own tray and hub as well, unlike Sony's insane 3DVD'S-on-one-spindle cases!

THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG (1934) was Warner's initial Perry Mason offering, and they pull out all ballyhoo stops in the included trailer.  The story by Erle Stanley Gardner was initially published in installments in LOOK Magazine, and became a sensation.  The film's ""A"" production values are rendered moot by the scratchy, speckled and spliced transfer.  Luckily the story and acting are first rate. We are first introduced to Perry Mason by establishing shots of his many stenciled office windows, personal switchboard operators, large opulent offices and vignettes of clients complaining to his bevy of specialty lawyers because they cannot be personally represented by Mason himself.  The case/mystery involves an extremely nervous client wanting advice on how to remove a neighbors howling dog while suspiciously presenting scenarios that might impact a will he wants to write.  At first skeptical, Mason quickly changes his mind when the client leaves a $10,000 retainer on his desk before he disappears.  With a supporting cast that includes Mary Astor, Allen Jenkins, Grant Mitchell and Helen Trenholme as Della Street, THE CASE OF THE HOWLING DOG is a fine little mystery film, and is anchored by a strong commanding believable performance by Warren William ......

THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE (1935) The second in the series and the last given an ""A"" budget, also benefits from the direction of the famous Michael Curtiz  (THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, CASABLANCA, MILDRED PIERCE and on and on).  Labeled a ""Clue Club Selection"" in the opening credits (one of only 12 films that received that moniker*), the print is slightly better this go-round, with occasional crystal clear segments that make the just passable bulk more maddening!  The film is also famous for containing the American debut of Errol Flynn in a small but pivotal role. Ironically, it was Warner's casting of Flynn as the lead in CAPTAIN BLOOD not long afterward, a role they had previously promised William to mollify him during contract negotiations, that caused Warren to sour on the studio and eventually find a way to end his contract.  Strangely, the script of the film changes the tone of Mason's portrayal, making him additionally a well-known and somewhat obsessive gastronome, who even has a gourmet meal delivered to the jail when he is having a conference with his imprisoned client!  When dinner with his assistants and coroner Wilbur Strong (Olin Howland) is interrupted, they even take their desert coffee AND samovar to the morgue, in what may be the first in a long line of ""eating at the autopsy"" film scenes (although here they only find a McGuffin in the coffin). An enjoyable contemporary Trailer is also included.  With Margaret Lindsay (a staple of 1930's and 1940's whodunits) as the titular BRIDE, and again supported by many Warner stock-players, Allen Jenkins (as Mason's investigator ""Spudsy""), Barton MacLane, Donald Woods (who'll get his chance in the sixth entry) and Claire Dodd (replacing Trenholme as Della Street), THE CASE OF THE CURIOUS BRIDE benefits greatly from Warren William's ability to seamlessly meld the serious and comedic elements into a believable characterization......

THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS (1935) Directed by Warner stalwart Archie Mayo (SVENGALI, THE PETRIFIED FOREST, A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA), the film's convoluted plot concerns the murder a con-artist impersonating a hosiery company representative who goes from town to town promoting ""Lucky Legs"" contests with a $1000 prize, paid in part by the department store and town convinced to sponsor it.  The lucky leggy winners never receive the prize money, since he skips town afterward, bilking everyone for his board, promotional costs, and of course the $1000 prize.  Perry Mason's characterization also undergoes another tone shift, this time the brilliant attorney is also a wise-cracking borderline alcoholic! The only allusion to the previous film's gastronomic angle is when his physician, Dr. Croker (played by the last film's coroner, Olin Howland) tells Perry he needs to lay off the rich food besides the booze.  There are also more comedic elements in scenes, like Mason's client Bradbury (Porter Hall) finding him ""sleeping it off"" behind his office desk, his ""raiding of the icebox"" while questioning two of the contestants, the milking of his new predilection for milk (sorry!) and the constant running banter with everyone, especially his fellow wise-cracking secretary Della Street, this time played by Genevieve Tobin, who could pass as Gracie Allen's slightly-smarter sister!  From the previous flick, Allen Jenkins returns as Mason's investigator ""Spudsy"" as does Barton MacLane, again in a thankless policeman role.  Also featured are Paticia Ellis as the the prize-winner ""whose brains are below her knees"" (according to the trailer, not me), Lyle Talbot as her jealous doctor boyfriend and Three Stooges foil Bud Jamison as a sarcastic bartender!  Picture quality is the most consistent yet, unfortunately that also goes for the scratches and speckles.  THE CASE OF THE LUCKY LEGS clips along at a breezy pace, with the usual double-crosses, red herrings and ulterior motives spiced with snappy dialog and the occasional non sequitur.  To again quote the trailer, it's ""First Nationals Melodramatic Comedy"" and ""A Rib-Tickling Warner Bros. & Vitaphone Hit!""  The customary ending denouement occurs with every character who's still alive in Mason's office while he undergoes a physical examination!  A most enjoyable slick little ""B"" programmer whose 77 minutes fly by......

THE CASE OF THE VELVET CLAWS (1936) The 4th and last Perry Mason film (and another ""Clue Club Selection"") starring Warren William  begins with Perry marrying his long-suffering secretary Della Street (portrayed again by Claire Dodd from the second series entry).  After being driven to their hotel by Mason's sidekick Spudsy Drake (Eddie Acuff replacing Alan Jenkins), the plot is set in motion when Perry is kidnapped from his honeymoon suite by Eva Belter (Winifred Shaw), a conniving femme fatale (who would give Mary Astor's Brigid in THE MALTESE FALCON a run for her money) who demands his help to avoid a scandal. From there on it's a convoluted mixture of murders, lies, set-ups, blackmail, and sleeping tablets in warm milk!  Della is none too pleased with her continually interrupted honeymoon either, especially when Perry is accused of murder.  He also has a scandal sheet, ""Spicy Bits,"" breathing down his neck. Olan Howland makes his 3rd appearance, this time back as coroner Wilbur Strong who's also Perry's doctor!  Pedestrianly directed by William Clemens (THE NANCY DREW SERIES, THE FALCON SERIES) on a ""B"" budget, William's portrayal is more in line with the first film, with less comedic sidetracks, although we get Spudsy in drag at one point and enough snappy banter to keep your interest from waning.  This time the denouement occurs with everyone on their way to the courthouse so Perry can stop fed-up Della's petition for an annulment!  The picture quality is again clear and focused, including the scratches and speckles.  Another contemporary Trailer is included.

THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT (1936) The film series' 5th installment is much closer in tone to the famous long-running television series than the previous four!  Ricardo Cortez delivers a strong performance, portraying the super-sleuth attorney as a more serious and believable character, whose vices aren't gourmet food or good liquor, but crossword puzzles and waffles! June Travis as Perry's secretary Della Street is a confident confidant and trusted gate-keeper, with nary a mention of their marriage from the last film. Besides their obvious affection for each other and the usual snappy banter, the only hint of romance comes from a bit of innuendo at the end.  Also, Perry's investigator and ""right-hand"" (Gary Owen)is finally referred to as Paul Drake, and in the picture's courtroom finale, Perry has to match wits with District Attorney Hamilton Burger (Guy Usher). The plot revolves around wealthy curmudgeon Peter Laxter, portrayed by the film's only well-known face, the delightful character actor Harry Davenport (GONE WITH THE WIND, MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, KINGS ROW, and 160 others!), his will changes, greedy relatives and the caretaker's pet cat Clinker.  A decent little mystery with a bevy of suspects, a convoluted plot that keeps you guessing, and a breezy 66 minute run time that doesn't give you a chance to get bored, what else could you ask for?  The picture quality is the best yet, very clear and focused with less scratches and speckles, probably since it's elements haven't undergone much usage! The included Trailer states that the story was originally serialized in Liberty Magazine and is trumpeted as another ""Clue Club Of The Month"" offering.  Going in with admittedly lowered expectations, I found THE CASE OF THE BLACK CAT to be an surprisingly entertaining little gem......

THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP (1937) First National/Warner Brother's sixth and final Perry Mason series entry stars Donald Woods as Mason. Wood's prolific career included over 200 film and television roles.  The cast's most famous face, Ann Dvorak (SCARFACE, THREE ON A MATCH, FLAME OF BARBARY COAST) stars as the fifth Della Street. Coincidentally, Dvorak also co-starred with Warren William in three films, including his last, THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI in 1947. Mason's private investigator Paul Drake is played (sometimes for comic relief) by another prolific actor, Joseph Crehan, whose 350 credits included the distinction of portraying President/General Ulysses S. Grant nine times. Frank Faylen (IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS) also has a small supporting role. Helmed by VELVET CLAWS director William Clemens, this mystery concerns an Australian Bishop (Edward McWade) who wants Perry to help right a wrong involving an heir to a millionaire's fortune given up for adoption twenty years beforehand. With the help of Della, Drake and bumbling hotel detective McGooney (occasional Three Stooges' foil Tom Kennedy, Perry sorts out the fake identities, red herrings, half-truths and lies, along with solving the millionaire's murder and ties them up in a neat bow for District Attorney Hamilton Burger (Charles Wilson, in his 3rd MASON series appearance) by the last reel.  The picture is watchable, but in rougher shape than those proceeding.  The is no trailer. Although not as lively as the Warren William entries, THE CASE OF THE STUTTERING BISHOP is another enjoyable ""B"" programmer, and ends the series admirably......

Obviously this set won't interest everyone, but is a boon to fans of Warren William and anyone enamored with 1930's and 40's black & white detective mysteries. The PERRY MASON series, along with a multitude of others, PHILO VANCE**, THE FALCON, THE THIN MAN, MR. WU, CHARLIE CHAN, MR. MOTO, THE LONE WOLF**, THE SAINT, SHERLOCK HOLMES, DICK TRACY, BULLDOG DRUMMOND, even NANCY DREW to name a few, were very popular during that time period and entertained movie audiences as well as radio listeners.  The original novels and the magazines that serialized them or published original stories also sold quite well. I'm sure there will be the usual complaints from customers about the companies releasing them on CD-R's without any remastering, but at least they're now available, and in better quality than shady bootlegs or horrible public domain prints. With many of the above series being now released here and there it seems the studios are beginning to realize that the market is out there, as they have with the many noir films now available separately or in sets. Let's hope the trickle turns into a flood......

*Starting around 1935, Warner Brothers/First National began releasing a series of mystery films in association with Joseph Shaw's BLACK MASK MAGAZINE under the ""Clue Club"" banner. Youngsters could join and receive a Clue Club card that would give them a chance to win prizes by going to see the pictures. (Thanx to JUST A CINEAST and NitrateVille!)

7039375,5,B00UGQLCK0,I love it! I have always loved watching old movies. I am so glad that I can get these movies on line.,1364083200,,101,3.6363636363636362
7039376,5,B00UGQLCK0,Have watched my Perry Mason DVD and enjoyed this older version of Perry Mason much better than the PERRY MASON TV SERIES.  The DVDs were in perfect viewing condition and had really great storylines in the episodes.,1363392000,23,214,4.783783783783784
7039377,5,B00UGQLCK0,"usually like warner b movies, and these are in great shape for their age.  Very happy with discs and their packaging",1363305600,,116,4.523809523809524
7039378,3,B00UGQLCK0,"Though it was enjoyable, the tone of each movie was so different as to almost make one remember what the term ""B"" movie meant during the studio era.",1362960000,,148,4.321428571428571
7039379,3,B00UGQLCK0,The stories were not especially well done...no continuity of characters but probably ok for the 30's era.  Adequate as part of a Perry Mason collection.,1362441600,2,152,5.08
7039380,3,B00UGQLCK0,"Interesting interpretation of the character as portraited by Warren William, Ricardo Cortez, and Donald Woods.  Having been exposed  for decades to the TV series with Raymond Burr, it's difficult to appreciate the different styles of these early actors without being judgemental in the extreme.  Warren William, who plays Mason  in 3 of the 5 films, seems uncertain about just how the character should be played, showing a different style in each of the 3, making it hard to see him as the same character from film to film  Ricardo Cortez was definitely the wrong choice to play the lawyer, as was Donald Woods.  Both of these actors were not up to the job.  All 5 of the movies were certainly entertaining as stand-alone films, but disappointing when compared to the TV series.",1362182400,2,778,4.848484848484849
7039381,3,B00UGQLCK0,"I found it very interesting and rather amusing, seeing the thirties version of Perry Mason.  It was quite different from Raymond Burr version, especially the character of Paul Drake.  But I liked it.",1361145600,2,199,5.0
7039382,4,B00UGQLCK0,"It's been decades since the 1930s Perry Mason movies were in circulation and here they are collected in a single set -- six movies, and four starring one of the leading men of the day, Warren William. The first is, in many ways, the strongest: ""The Case of the Howling Dog"" with Mary Astor as femme fatale and Helen Trenholme as Della Street. Perry is played straight and the romantic attachments with Della are true to Erle Stanley Gardner's conception form his novels. The next three William outings are a bit mixed with ""The Case of the Lucky Legs"" an ineffective attempt to turn Mason into ""The Thin Man"" -- a drunk, sarcastic lout who somehow manages to save the day. Things return to a more serious tone when Ricardo Cortez plays Perry in ""The Case of the Black Cat"".

It's an impressive line-up of directors, beginning with Alan Crossland (""The Jazz Singer""), Michael Curtiz (""Casablanca"", ""Mildred Pierce""), Archie Mayo (""The Petrified Forest"", ""A Night in Casablanca"") and WIlliam McGann (""The Treasure of Sierra Madre"", ""Key Largo"").

The prints are well mastered with strong sound. Easily 4 stars all round; enthusiasts will not hesitate in handing out five.",1360454400,,1169,4.898989898989899

7039384,3,B00UGQLCK0,"I liked the energy of Curious Bride and Lucky Legs, Allen Jenkins always adds interest.
William Warren seems to be going through the motions in the last two of his performances.
There are some good character actors spread across the films, I always like to see Harry Davenport, Genevieve Tobin, Porter Hall, Olin Howard, Mary Treen, Wini Shaw and Mary Astor. Errol Flynn in a pre Captain Blood can be glimpsed in a flashback in Curious Bride! Apart from a few trailers (always good to see), there are no extras whatsover. Also, there has been no restoration. I've seen a lot worse though. Worth buying if you like 1930s detective thrillers such as The Saint or The Falcon or Warners series such as Torchy Blane.",1359590400,26,711,4.696
7039385,1,B00UGQLCK0,"Very frustrating experience.  The stories and acting appeared to have been good if one could abide the constant skipping.  Some of the movies couldn't even be accessed.  Had to return it twice.  We're surprised that Amazon doesn't quality check their merchandise, (at least DVDs) before selling it.",1359590400,15,298,5.276595744680851
7039386,5,B00UGQLCK0,good old perry mason mysteries. Just as good as the ones with Raymond Burr. Can watch over and over and still enjoy them.,1358985600,2,121,4.304347826086956
7039387,3,B00UGQLCK0,"Warren Williams as Perry Mason is disappointing.  He is too clownish.  Ricardo Cortez and Donald Woods are better.
The Ricardo Cortez' plot was later made into one of the Raymond Burr episodes and more aptly titled.  Why they call the
cat ""black"" is a mystery, since it is black and white.  Movies to be watched as nostalgia, but the plots are nothing to write home about.",1358899200,4,372,4.590909090909091
7039388,5,B00UGQLCK0,So happy to be able to watch the old movies of Perry Mason.  Enjoyed seeing Perry played by someone else.  It was fun to see them set in an earlier time.,1358208000,2,153,3.903225806451613
7039389,5,B00UGQLCK0,"Warren William is great as Perry Mason and he did another series ""The Lone Wolf"". Unfortunately most of his films are from the pre-code era and he is not as well known as other stars which is a shame.  Hope to see more of his films on Dvd's.  He can play ruthless, dramatic and romantic or comedy leads Has the best laugh and in my opinion a great star that has been lost.  I'm  glad Turner Classic Movies shows his films.  You can see Errol Flynn and many other stars before they became famous in Warren William's movies.",1357776000,34,522,4.285714285714286

8706575,5,B00UGQLCK0,"Now here's a set of Warner Bros. (I had no idea there were movies about Perry Mason) movies depicting Perry Mason, before TV icon Raymond Burr portrayed the brilliant attorney.  Each movie is based upon TV episodes which later aired during the 50's.  Great stuff!",1530403200,,263,4.822222222222222
8706576,5,B00UGQLCK0,"This disc showed me the original Perry Mason back in the the day.  I loved that these showed him with a real sense of humor and the relationship with Della was more intense than the series.  The series only showed them as really good friends, nothing to personal about their relationship.",1529625600,,288,4.627450980392157
8706577,5,B00UGQLCK0,"A very big fan of old b&w movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s - especially noir.  This is a different Perry, almost ""aristocratic"" in bearing.  Very entertaining - haven't viewed all of them yet, but looking forward to a binge session!",1527379200,,233,4.523809523809524

Disc 1, The Case of the Howling Dog, Good Transfer, a few lines in the film, Good Story.  The Best of the 6 Films and Best Cast.
The Case of the Curious Bride, Good Transfer, a few lines in film, Good Story.  Both Staring Warren William.
Disc 2,  The Case of the Crazy Legs and The Case of the Velvet Claws are both Duds.  Staring Warren William.
Disc 3,  The Case of the Black Cat, which is Not Black Cat, and a Preposterous Conclusion to the story.  Bad Transfer, going from light to dark, out focus.  Staring Ricardo Cortez, catch him one his better films.  The Maltese Falcon (1931) aka ""Dangerous Female"" or The Walking Dead (1936) or The House on 56th Street (1933)
The Case of the Stuttering Bishop, the Best Film Transfer, but it is another Dud.  Staring Donald Woods",1526428800,,799,4.417808219178082
