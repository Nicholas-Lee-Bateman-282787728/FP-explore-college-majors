8442540,3,B004V2D6SG,"This movie delivers a strong message 'Love is part of life not heart of life'!!! Though its not applicable for everyone around,but some of us may badly need it. That's what its been seen that most of guys(boys in many cases) just waste their time seeking around love forgetting all their responsibilities. To be more precise it seems to be happening in India and film is been successful to catch this problem....

Overall,if you have time and don't hate songs then go for this movie.........",1304467200,,491,4.776470588235294
