7694745,4,B01CYV7QWC,"Valley of Love oozes with so much subtleness one needs not to read between the lines but between two great French actors: Huppert and Depardieu.

This move directed by Guillaume Nicloux is so subtle and anti-Hollywood blockbuster movies one needs to see the subtleness by using the eyes, and seeing it for oneself. Made in 2015, Valley of Love is about old love burnt out. Both Huppert and Depardieu have moved on with their lives, yet 25 years after their divorce they get a strange letter from their only child together. The letter says the son is dying, and his final wish is for them to get together in Death Valley to search for clues to his life.

The two lead character, Isabelle, played of course by Isabelle Huppert, and Gerard, played by Gerard Depardieu, reunite after receiving the letters from their photographer son. He wants them to visit five sites in Death Valley in the grueling heat and sun in eastern California. Their son is dying or is already dead. Isabelle who has remarried and has daughters from her second marriage, hasn't kept in contact with her first husband, Gerard, who stayed single after their divorce.

The films subtleness mainly comes in through the camera. Depardieu must weigh close to 280 pounds while Huppert must tip the scale at a 100 pounds. Both, in the movie, walk and talk  to overcome their grief about their son and their failed marriage.

The plot is quite gloomy and depressive, but that is made up with the spectacular acting and cinematography by Christoph Offenstein. The visual beauty of Death Valley in California is a sight to behold. The visual effects of nature's beauty carries this sad story of failed love, failed parenthood, and failed hope and expectations.

Ironically, in the movie, Huppert and Depardieu play famous actress and actor, he more famous than her. Yet, both are aging, wilting by the power of age and time. Nonetheless when they visit a few of the sites their son wanted them to see, the old French art form of Surrealism comes into play. Depardieu experiences eerie distortion of reality while walking through the rock formations of Death Valley. Yet Surrealism is not the leading artistic form of expression in this film. It's subtleness. Especially what is not seen or heard, many facts are only eluded to. Both Huppert and Depardieu have gotten old and visually unappealing, yet that's never said in this movie, it's only shown, or implied through the art of subtleness.

To watch this movie simply as a movie, I think, is the wrong approach. It would have been too depressing and sad to watch old lovers fretting about their only true connection left, their son who is dead, their connection to each other no longer exist. The main actor Depardieu is getting old, fat, and irrational. While Huppert tries to stay young by chatting with one of her daughters from her second marriage, but those children from marriage two also causes her emotional pain.

This movie works on so many different angles and themes it becomes an emotional rollercoaster. It's far from a five star rating movie, but with two heavy weight actors, at least let's call Depardieu a heavyweight, this movie is worth watching. Huppert and Depardieu have earned their stripes in French cinema. That alone, two great actors, made Valley of Love worth watching.",1469318400,,3312,4.849557522123894

7694747,3,B01CYV7QWC,"Im really on the fence on this one. The acting is great and the scenery beautiful (and at least one laugh out moment had me in stiches  no spoiler here but it refers to the lead actor in Taxi Driver) but the story is really symbolic (the director calls it spiritual) rather than fully fleshed out.
A bit of backstory may help those just finding it. The writer/director (French) originally intended this film -about a long divorced couple whose son has committed suicide coming together (in a request sent to them by the son before he died) in Death Valley in California- to star Isabelle Huppert and be in English. That changed and the director looked for a new co-star. He chose Gerard Depardieu, Hupperts former real-life husband. And he made the film (mostly) in French. All those who are other than the two leads speak in English but the rest is in French  with VERY easy to read subtitles (I nice touch on all the Strand Releasing films Ive seen over the last couple of years). I don't feel Ive spoiled anything by revealing the basic story line above. You need to see why they had to come to California and what they find and that is reason for watching the film.

By the way, the fictional characters are also former movie stars and their names are the same as the two lead actors. They are playing themselves and then again not.
If you love these actors, I can recommend the film but it is certainly not their most compelling film and  at least for me  it was way too ambiguous.

The only bonus is the Theatrical Trailer.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7694748,4,B01CYV7QWC,"This is very interesting. Funny these two were married once in real life, and use their own names in the film. Poor Gerard needs to lose some weight. But, not sure if that was intentional for this film. I've never seen a plot like this before. It's rather like a mystery.",1467244800,,271,4.333333333333333
7694749,4,B01CYV7QWC,"This is a tour de force for the two lead actors, G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert, who remain at the top of their form. Remarkable performances! The music for the film is based on Charles Ives' classic ""The Unanswered Question,"" which will give you an idea, perhaps, of what it's all about. It builds a fascinating low-key air of suspense and mystery, but without resorting to scares or gross-outs (except for the regrettable sight of M. Depardieu in a bathing suit!) A good movie for practicing your French, as the actors speak clearly and in good French, rather than dialect and slang, as is often the case. In spite of our limited French, we could have turned off the subtitles and gotten most of the dialog. Great scenery of Death Valley.",1466035200,5,754,4.763358778625954
7694750,4,B01CYV7QWC,"I was fascinated with this combo of actors together and it kept me hooked from start to finish.  Although I have a grasp of what the symbolism was about, I will have to research to find out what I missed.",1465862400,3,204,4.1
8754377,3,B01CYV7QWC,"Rented it in part because the comments mentioned there would not be English subtitles, and was surprised to find that they have been added. If you considered renting this movie but were put off by the fact that you didn't speak French, you don't have to hesitate anymore.
Isabelle Huppert has range --although I find she shines best in settings that accord well with her classical, frigid (not like that) beauty, so the desert wasn't --esthetically speaking-- her best setting, in my opinion.
Depardieu was Depardieu. If you like him, you'll enjoy this; if --like me-- you don't, then you'll suffer through his scenes.
Decent movie ideally suited for a rainy afternoon while trying to survive the flu. Otherwise, it falls into the category of ""filler"". Because it stars Huppert, this filler contains about 35% gold, but it's not a cinematic experience that'll blow anyone's hair back --subtitles or not.",1525132800,,903,5.026666666666666

8754382,4,B01CYV7QWC,"""Valley of Death"" (2015 release from France; 94 min.) brings the story of Isabelle and Gerard. As the movie opens, we see Isabelle walking through a resort, suitcase-on-wheels in tow, and checking in her room. The next day or so, Gerard also checks in, and soon we understand that they area a long-divorced couple who are mourning the suicide of their 31 yr. old son Michael. In his suicide note, Michael invites his parents to be in Death Valley on November 12, 2014, where he promises to see them again. At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: while Isabelle Huppert and Gerard Depardieu have been in movies together before, it's been decades since the last time. Here they play a fictional version of themselves (at one point, a guest in the resort tells Gerard, 'hey I recognize you, what movie were you in again? do you mind giving me an autograph?"", which Gerard signs as ""Robert de Niro"", ha!). Isabelle and Gerard (the movie characters) have not seen each other in YEARS, and now struggle to understand their son's death, and why they are in Death Valley anyway. Will Michael appear, as he promised? (I won't spoil....) Meanwhile, Isabelle and Gerad talk, and talk some more, and then yet some more. At least the photography (filmed in Death Valley) is eye candy from start to finish. Which is more than we can say about Depardieu, grossly overweight (and has been for years), shown way too many times with far too little clothing. I had the good fortune of visiting Death Valley a few years back, and was surprised how beautiful it was, truly a memorable visit and I'd readily recommend you do it if you have the chance (I did it as a day-long trip from Vegas, which is 2 hours away).

""Valley Of Love"" premiered at the 2015 Cannes film festival. I can't recall whether it ever received a release in US theaters (and if it did, it bypassed Cincinnati). But I saw it at my local library the other day and immediately picked it up. The movie was okay, not great, not bad. The movie's entire raison dtre is to watch these giants of French cinema act together. For that alone, I'd have to give 4 stars, but alas, I can't as the underlying story is paper-thin. Even ""Huppert"" and ""Depardieu"" (as they are billed in the credits) can only do so much with the little material they are given here.",1475452800,2,2439,4.528344671201814

8754385,4,B01CYV7QWC,"Isabelle Huppert is my favorite actress in the world.  I watch all her work, sometimes many times over.  Her facial expressions are so nuanced.  I much prefer watching a human act than some CGI sensation.  Isabelle is a master craftsperson.  As for this film, you won't be disappointed with her acting.  The story is touching and original.  Depardieu acts well also.  It may be too slow paced for some.  But this is fine-art cinema, not just entertainment.",1470268800,,456,4.818181818181818
8754386,2,B01CYV7QWC,"No English subtitles when the actors speak French, only when they speak English.  So, not at all helpful.  Avoid this movie unless you speak French.",1469664000,2,148,4.88
