3917693,5,B002EJBZHM,"""Valentino, The Last Emperor,"" is a fascinating exploration of Italian fashion legend Valentino and his brilliantly creative designs, his prima donna yet likable personality, and his long-term business and romantic partnership with Giancarlo Giammeti.  The photography captures the beauty of Valentino's designs, and director Matt Tyrnauer manages to get beyond the outward personas of Valentino and his partner to catch them in off-guard and revealing moments.  Clips from Fellini from the La Dolce Vita days of Rome in the early 1960s, when Valentino rose to prominence, add a mystique and historic context to the film.  Along the way, we witness the decline of the individual fashion couturier as corporations buy out the great designer's company, and fashion becomes more about marketing than individual creative expression and genius.  The movie is also just plain fun to watch, with some great one-liners and very amusing exchanges between these two talented men, who know one another's foibles yet accept one another in the way only old lovers and companions can.",1255219200,,1070,5.389221556886228

3917697,4,B002EJBZHM,"""Valentino: The Last Emperor"" follows the personal and professional life of fashion designer Valentino Garavani from his Spring/Summer 2006 collection to his 45-year retrospective celebration in Rome in July 2007, just months before Valentino retired. That's about a year and a half, a short period in a very long career. But its purpose is not so much to honor Valentino's contributions to women's fashion as to document the changing world of fashion that Valentino survived for 5 decades, remaining in control of his designs and working in his Rome design studio until his retirement at the age of 75.

Valentino's former boyfriend and the business partner responsible for making Valentino SpA an international success, Giancarlo Giammetti, graces this film with multiple interviews. Valentino speaks for himself as well, but we get to know him best by observing the work and bickering behind the scenes in his design studio, runway shows, and at a lavish bash at his Chateau de Wideville outside of Paris. Because this film encompasses the 2007 retrospective celebration, we get some glimpses back in time as well as a look at the process of creating new designs.

At one time, designers made money by selling clothes. In the 1980s, it was licensing. In the 1990s, fashion houses became commodities for international investment companies. Valentino kept on designing through it all. In 1998, Valentino and Giammetti sold the company to HdP. In 2002, Valentino SpA was sold to Marzotto Group -and this film witnesses some of the clashes of priorities between Valentino and Mateo Marzotto. We watch as the company is sold in 2007 to Peramira LLC, a private equity company whose goal is clearly to make money. Valentino was the last man standing of his generation of designers in a business that has been radically transformed over the course of his career. That's what ""Valentino: The Last Emperor"" is all about. In English, Italian, and French with optional subtitles.

The DVD (Phase 4 Films 2009): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer and three featurettes. In ""The Perfect Life: Around the World with Valentino"" (30 min), Michael Kelly, Majordomo of Valentino's six residences, takes us behind the scenes at Chateau Wideville, Chalet Gifferhorn at Gstaad, and Valentino's apartment in New York. If you liked the scenes at Chateau Wideville in the film, there is more of that here. ""The Last Collection"" (9 min) takes us to Paris in January 2008, as Valentino shows his last couture collection and says goodbye to his staff. ""A Red Dress"" (8 min) shows more detail of creating the red dress we see in the film, particularly of head seamstress Antonietta de Angelis. Subtitles available in English for the bonus features. Subtitles available in English, Spanish, and French for the film.",1253750400,21,2793,5.093886462882096
3917698,4,B002EJBZHM,"After seeing the Charlie Rose interview and then watching this fast paced film I really cared personally about these two fashion world guys. Valentino's designs as they evolve from sketch to draping to  model ready to runway perfection wow at every stage. The dresses and suits endow the wearer with  femininity through a body hugging silhouette, with refinement through the use of costly materials and with glamour by the addition of extravagant  embellishments.  More than 45 years as a designer and every design is a unique work of art. The process is brutal at times; the film shines a light on berated , exhausted seamstresses as they translate a concept into a  ""Valentino"".  Near meltdowns occur as tensions rise at the approach of a seasonal presentation. But far from being a mere artist,  Valentino knows his way around media spin, client flattery, party giving and self indulgence; he's as shrewd a showman and salesman as you`ll find. But he spends like a drunk and is still insecure enough that he needs to hear he's good from the one person whose opinion can seem to really shake him to the core. Enter Giancarlo.

And this is where Matt Tyrnauer, the producer/director  deserves special credit for he captures the two men's complex interdependency with revealing riffs and amusing editing.

Giancarlo makes the pieces of the Valentino enterprise ( logistical, financial, promotional and administrative) come together because he possesses vision and self-confidence, grace and toughness, ideas aplenty yet the ability to self edit, momentum not without  discipline, straightforwardness combined with circumspection, and outstanding organizational skill plus a nose for the direction of the business.  Valentino went bankrupt before he met Giancarlo, now he has five marvelous homes and a yacht. Giancarlo benefited materially as well but the sole reward that seems to bring him great happiness is appreciation and praise from Valentino.

And when Valentino finally comes for a hug and to say thank you, Giancarlo enfolds his partner  in his arms and holds on for dear life.  I have never seen a mutual love this deep play out on the screen, and powerfully, they aren't actors.  This is an amazing story and left me wondering why this kind of love is sadly so rare.",1253577600,6,2278,5.083333333333333
3917699,5,B002EJBZHM,"Sadly Valentino has retired, but he was a master of Haute Couture!!! He stands next to Karl Lagerfeld (at Chanel) as one of the best in the business!!!

3917700,5,B002EJBZHM,I Saw this film TWICE  in NYC when it was in private small theaters and I still have parts which I would like to rewind and play again!!...Not a film for fashion interests only...it is funny and a good cultural film as well...course if you are into fashion this is a must buy!,1247875200,3,276,4.2075471698113205
3917701,5,B002EJBZHM,"I saw this movie in a local theatre and it was far better than I expected.  Although there is a lot about fashion, I found the most light-hearted and funny moments about Valentino's relationship with Giancarlo.  They are such a great couple....  they complete each other and their 'married' style of bickering made me laugh a lot.  Wonderful fashions, lots of celebrities, and yes, the special pugs that seem to take over everything!  Definately can't wait until 08 September for the DVD to be released!",1247184000,19,503,4.870588235294117
3917702,5,B002EJBZHM,"Here is how haute couture is made. Valentino employed 100 seamstresses and owned one sewing machine (which no one would use).  In the film, you see how each dress was lovingly designed and assembled and how the 45+ year partnership of Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giametti produced runway show after runway show.  These partners clearly inspire the love and loyalty of their staff.

You see the sense of style that pervades the life. The entertaining, the travel, the pampered pets.

While the film is a fully positive portrait of this marvelous fashion house and its two leaders, the future looms. The company was sold in 1998 (and then again).  The corporate owners don't appreciate the art and want more handbags, shoes and ready to wear.  There are glimpses of this pressure as the film leads up to Rome's ""45 Years of Valentino"", a retrospective with pageantry worthy of its subject.

The film has a genuine quality.  Some shots, being candid, won't have the perfect balance and people hesitate in speech.  You see the tension in the preparation for big shows.

While others will not appreciate the film, if you are interested in the art of fashion, this is a must see.",1243728000,38,1178,4.8159203980099505

3917707,5,B002EJBZHM,"This was a very entertaining documentary, only wish it was longer! It was interesting to see the creative side of designing a gown and the eventual production of a fashion show. Valentino and his partner Giancarlo, a patient and kind man, were both riveting in their differing roles.

My favorite parts were the behind the scenes prep work. Namely, the seamstresses who actually make the gowns; they do all the stitching, cutting, attaching crystals and beads BY HAND -that's how amazingly talented these people are. Their work is extremely detailed and perfect, it's easy to see why haute couture costs as much as it does. The film shows a glimpse of Valentino's expertise and vision coming to life during the creative process as he adds or deletes finishing touches on a fit model. Special attention to how fabric is cut and how it moves as the model walks, ""to see a woman's ankles while walking in an evening gown is vulgar.""

The DVD has an 'extras' section that is as good as the film, it left me wanting to see more. Valentino's life is hectic and seems to be on fast forward 24/7 and he doesn't miss a step thanks to his talented team. He employs fantastic people who get the job done despite bad weather and things not working as planned. I was impressed by the American man that runs all of Valentino's homes in several countries including entertainment, parties and special events. He is efficient, calm and pleasant as were most of the people featured in this film. There are some celeb shots thrown in which was fun to see them behaving normally amid the extraordinary world they inhabit.

This is a must see if you enjoy beauty in all it's forms e.g., art, fashion, the creative process and people watching, in general. Would like to have seen more of where he gets his ideas and themes for a collection.",1426636800,,1818,4.6397515527950315

I have been watching fashion & haute couture since the 80s & Valentino was simply superb as a designer. His women always looked amazing even upto 2002/04. But now the valentino woman look boring as hell & not as glamourous as before.

This film kept focusong on his retirement & the lifestyle & never explained why he was amazing or what drove his look. So as a film, it was all lights & no real insight into the creative process or talent per se. Sad.",1411776000,,522,4.262626262626263

Great to experience moments of the mind of a great creator. There are a couple of low rating reviews - but they mainly compare with other documentaries, don't. Enjoy this for what it is. It is especially interesting, I think, for minds in the or interested in fashion - obviously - but would make a great documentary for the more educated and curious viewer.

3917726,5,B002EJBZHM,"Recommended to me by another ""Amazonian"" who also appreciates great design, this retrospective on Valentino's work and career is just wonderful.  He is a man of some mystery and he actually maintains quite a bit of that.  However, for his clothes, his design and his methods, he keeps few secrets in this documentary.  He lives his life like someone who has nothing else to prove - which at this point, he doesn't.

Actually, some of my favorite parts of this doc are those filmed at Valentino's homes.  Watching his majordomo and team of staff prepare for parties and their employer's comings and goings is quite extraordinary. I loved the footage in which rugs were changed out for an upcoming ""do"" at the chateau.  I especially liked the story behind his acquisition and restoration of his chateau.  The end result of his touch (and considerable investment) is just stunning.

If you love beauty and enjoy looking at oppulence, you will find this documentary very pleasing.  The best part for me is watching Valentino's designs.  Just flawless!",1376352000,3,1047,4.9314285714285715
3917727,5,B002EJBZHM,"If you were not fortunate enough to make it to the Ara Pacis in Rome for the Valentino retrospective: this movie is an opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the greatest careers in Design history. Not only is it entertaining , factual, but sentimental.  This period of time from the 1960's- through his retirement was the greatest time in human history for creativity and clothing manufacturing. This story gives you a glimpse into the lifestyle of one of the great designers. The movie is a biography, a look into the life of the worlds elite  and also gives you an idea of how many lives and employees were enhanced by this gifted man. It is also a great love story between Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti.

also came away wondering, without whom could he not have existed
as he did?? Of course, there is Giammetti, the supreme organizer,
strategist, financial whiz and keeper of the Valentino flame....
There was Valentino's majordomo who impeccably kept the wheels
fluidly rolling in V's life and homesteads...The pugs who possibly filled a niche in his existence that might otherwise have been occupied by his unrealized children....But in Valentino's particular worldof fashion and ultimate celebrity I cannot help but give shining accolades to the women of consumate skill and patience who sat around tables all hours of the day & night hand-stitching away and bringing to fruition the acknowledged genius of the man who managed to fulfill his dream of making women feel beautiful...
He carried his magnetic aura like a mantle, tantalized and inspired those about him and ultimately personified ""triumph of

3917744,5,B002EJBZHM,"I was reminded of this excellent movie today while reading an article in the New York Times about all the effort and money that went into Marc Jacobs' Fashion Week show - nine minutes, more than one million dollars.  Sound over the top?  It's not once you see all the planning and detail that needs to go into a production like that.  Valentino - both the film and the movie - similarly sweats over the details.

This is a relentlessly compelling and fascinating movie from director Matt Tyrnauer.  It's more than just a movie about a fashion icon.  It's foremost a story about the long and enduring relationship between Valentino Garavani and 40+ year partner (business, life and otherwise), Giancarlo Giammetti.  While it's Valentino who focuses on the clothes and brings the creative discipline, it's the unsung Giammetti who executes the ideas, runs the business and mounts the shows.  The parallels between this partnership and the one the Times spotlighted today between Jacobs and long-time partner Robert Duffy are striking.

Another fascinating aspect of the film: how the reclusive Valentino has pulled back the curtains to give us a glimpse at his version of the daily grind.  Director Tyrnauer simply gets it: he knows that the most fascinating aspect of any film like this is to simply show us how this famous person goes about his life, to present him as flesh and blood rather than icon.  So we see Valentino skiing, taking his meals, sharing private moments with Giammetti, planning parties, spoiling his brood of pugs (Milton, Molly, Margot, Maude and Monty) and so on.  In some aspects, just like us.  In other moments (private jets, chalets, country estates), not so much.

The most memorable part for me is that even a Genius designer would face situation where other people tried to put their opinion on his work.",1292803200,,381,4.686567164179104

3917747,5,B002EJBZHM,"Come take a look behind the scenes of the fascinating world of haute couture and Valentino, the world-renowned fashion designer. This film focuses on two shows: a 2006 collection show in Paris and a 2007 retrospective show in Rome celebrating his 45 year career. The film crew follows Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti, his longtime business partner and companion, through the lengthy process from design to show. It's amazing how much preparation and work it takes.

The documentary is interspersed with film from Valentino's earlier days where he was influenced by the silver screen. View a world of fashion few have access to, including the elaborate parties, glamorous gowns, celebrities, and elaborate sets. Dog lovers will enjoy the antics of his five pugs. The film touches on the ownership of the company. A drawback is that most of the film is spoken in French and Italian with English subtitles.

One of the special features shows Valentino traveling between his homes in Paris, Rome, Gstaad, and New York and the perfectionism that goes into maintaining them.",1285891200,,1070,5.14367816091954
3917748,5,B002EJBZHM,well done documentary. tells a rich story about 2 men very close to each other. valentino is remarkable and the film shows him up close and personal in a compekking way. the viewer ends up liking them both!,1283126400,,206,4.447368421052632
3917749,4,B002EJBZHM,"not sure how to capture the craziness of this movie or this person who seems to pride himself on aggravating everyone including his longtime lover so it's hard to know where to start except that he, like this film, is endlessly entertaining, totally watchable, in fact, hard not to watch, even when Joan Collins is around, so this is not to be missed. Saw the premiere in New York and caught a cab after one of those TV fashionistas had refused to tip him on grounds he didn't get there fast enough. Sounds like something Valentino would do, so I can't blame her too much. i think there's an effort to see the man and the artist and thankfully, we do.",1280880000,,651,4.3884297520661155
3917750,5,B002EJBZHM,The story of this man's design beginning and ending in the fashion industry is very interesting.

I am insanely addicted to fashion and though I am not a buyer of haute couture--and most people, aren't, right?--I am a buyer of films like this that show us the people behind the clothes. It's really rich and not just in monetar terms. And the clothes are to lust for! If you're a fashionista, get this one. You will love it.",1267920000,,356,4.173913043478261

This documentary was fascinating from the minute it started.  It maintained a high level of visual beauty and the pace of the film was ""gracioiusly"" fast.  Many intimate details of the business and his personal relationship for 45+ years.

He has certainly lived a glamorous life.  He made it that way.",1261526400,,442,4.905405405405405

3917760,5,B002EJBZHM,"This documentary was not only an enjoyable story of Valentino's life and work in fashion, but it was funny too.  It must be the honesty and comfort Valentino and his long time business partner/friend, Giancarlo Giammetti find within their relationship.  It was great to see that within all the drama of the behind the scenes fashion world lies passion, drive, commitment and friendship at heart.  This documentary is worth watching. You'll never look at fashion the same way again.",1259798400,,481,5.063291139240507

It comes with gorgeous and very funny scenes and it definitely takes you inside the world of Valentino and what he is really all about - an extravagant man with a very top taste in life and a massive passion for his art 'fashion'. Love the pugs and the polenta mountains! lol. You have got to have it!,1257984000,,384,4.0
3917762,5,B002EJBZHM,"This is a wonderful look at a true couturier... one of the last great ones. He is a bit of a diva at moments, but I understand as millions of dollars are at stake with his name on it. The movie has surprisingly touching moments (although they are brief). There are glimpses of some of his clothing, but the movie leaves you wanting more... which is not a bad thing.
It would be impossible to cram a 50 year history into one film, and that is not what this is meant to be. You have to fill in a lot of gaps. This is a glimpse at a legendary couture house. A great film about a great icon!",1257206400,,587,3.983050847457627

3917767,5,B002EJBZHM,"If you love fashion, then watching Valentino: The Last Emperor simply cannot be missed. Unlike a typical fashion documentary, this film not only documents the mysterious world of THE AUTHENTIC HAUTE COUTURE, but also portrays the legendary couturier who desired nothing, but making women look, feel, and be beautiful. Karl Lagerfeld even justifies: ""COMPARED TO US, THE REST ARE MAKING RAGS.""",1255737600,,392,5.442622950819672

8367788,5,B002EJBZHM,"An excellent film on the life of a fashion legend. What I enjoyed the most was to be able to see the actual work that goes into the making of a haute couture garment. The hand work that is ninety five percent of the construction of a peice that cost as much as a house. The lavish life style of Valentino and his partner, business and personal,with the houses in Gastaad, Rome, France the Yachts and private jets. They may well be the last royality aside from Karl Lagerfield of high fashion a vanishing art form, in my opinion. because of the fewer number of women who not only can afford it but those who are interested in haute couture anymore like their mothers and grandmothers.
  There has always been a small group of women that made up the clientele of haute couture and that number has not increased so we'll have to see how far in the future couture will go. The expense is enormous to stage a showing which is no different than a Broadway production or Rock concert. For anyone who is a fashionista or just someone who is curious about high fashion and it's creators this is a real treat.",1471305600,,1099,4.382352941176471
