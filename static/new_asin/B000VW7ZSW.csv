8451255,5,B000VW7ZSW,"Helped me recapture my days back at ""Fighter Town USA"". Flying the F-4 Phantom & F-14 Tomcat were milestones in my Navy career. A perfect addition to my personal library.",1356912000,,170,4.7
8451256,4,B000VW7ZSW,"Great historical programs featuring the F-14 when it was entering the fleet. The second, third and forth programs had an intense reddish hue and a rough edge on the right side of the frame. Despite some really great footage showing the F-14 in action, the reddish hue almost made it unbearable for me to watch. The subject matter and narration were what made those programs worth it to me. I've seen some of the footage before, but without the reddish hue and scratchy borders, so I'm guessing the footage on the DVDs came from old tapes that have lost some of the picture quality. If picture quality of the footage is important to you, this may not be the dvd for you. If you are a fan of the F-14 or Naval Aviation, this is a great find. These are original programs produced in the 1970s by the US Navy/Grumman/Northrop (except for the last program which covers Topgun's move from Miramar to Fallon). Footage of the pilots briefing and debriefing was awesome and really well done, and the footage of the aircraft in action was great and much of it very rare. I enjoyed this a lot.",1289779200,,1082,4.49746192893401
