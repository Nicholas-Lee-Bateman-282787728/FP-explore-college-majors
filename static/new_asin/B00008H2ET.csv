7984121,4,B00008H2ET,"This is a collection of lesser known musicals. If you enjoy the Hollywood musical there are some good things in here. Royal Wedding has Astaire's famous ceiling and walls dance sequence. Happy Go Lovely is a mild little movie with gorgeous Vera-Ellen who was one of the very best dancers in the business. Anyway, some big names in some of their rarer efforts. Worth a try if you like the genre.",1421884800,2,394,4.563380281690141

7984123,3,B00008H2ET,"A previous review of this DVD list the 4 movies as Royal Wedding,
Perils of Pauline, You Were Never Lovlier and The Pajama Game
this is not correct, the 4 movies are Royal Wedding,Perils of Pauline
Till the Clouds Roll By and Happy go :Lovely.
Happy go Lovely is an excellent color print and of all the releases of
Till the Clouds Roll By this is the best print that I have purchased although
in no way the excellent quality of the MGM video released, hopefuly one
day MGM may consider a DVD release",1051660800,22,499,4.319148936170213
