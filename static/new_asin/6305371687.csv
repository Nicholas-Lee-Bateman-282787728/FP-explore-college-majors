7889073,4,6305371687,"Tiger Cage is a pretty great, quick, excitement filled Hong Kong action movie with some good twists and turns. A more underrated title in the pool of highly regarded HK action movies. Yuen Woo-Ping gets a pretty good handle on this story about love and betrayal in the Hong Kong police department.

Donnie Yen (before his big fame and glory) has a small part in the movie, but don't expect it to be a 'Donnie Yen film'. If you're looking for a different, non-John Woo flick like this, you will probably be pretty impressed with Tiger Cage. Unfortunately you'll be hard pressed to find a good quality copy of this movie on blu ray.",1432944000,,630,4.526315789473684
7889074,5,6305371687,"Good dvd good english subtitles, sad donnie yen died early in film still good film would recommend the follow up tiger cage 2, plenty of action , staring donnie yen , both films worth seeing got from amazon",1419552000,,206,4.447368421052632
7889075,5,6305371687,"Betrayal, police corruption, violence this movies captures the lot in a typical Hong Kong 1980s movie. Brilliant performace my Simon Yam who should be jailed for the clothes fashion of the time and Jacky Cheung as the young innocent officer.
Do Do gives a strong performance as the lady Cop. If you like HK poilce movies this is one to have. But hide from the kids.",1401408000,,365,4.545454545454546
7889076,1,6305371687,...'starring Donnie Yen' is a lie... he does a few walk ons then gets dead about 1/2 way through... disappointing...,1380153600,,116,4.85
7889077,1,6305371687,"Please be advised that like a number of these Hong Kong released Blu-Rays, the transfer was taken from the now decades old, analog non anamorphic widescreen transfer and then scaled to 1080p and given so much noise reduction, the image smears and ghosts in every single frame. The picture is WORSE than the terrible DVD's. This is not an exaggeration. It's that bad. I watched it with my own eyes.

There are some real foreign Blu-Rays out there. Armour of God II: Operation Condor is the real deal. But that is an anomaly. And that is a shame because Miramax transferred TIGER CAGE in 1080i years ago and it has aired on cable TV. It looks sensational. But we can't see it. Same goes for PEKING OPERA BLUES, which looked incredible on cable in High Def.

I have read that Netflix's version is the Miramax transfer, but I don't use Netflix and cannot confirm.",1347840000,3,859,4.571428571428571
7889078,4,6305371687,"The rating for this review is strictly based on the average for the score of each movie...I'm an extreme Donnie Yen fan and I just love watching him display his kick acrobatics...In TIGER CAGE 1, Donnie had an overall small role, but he does display some of his most hardcore fighting I have seen from him...but like I said he has a relatively small role in this one and Tiger Cage winds down being a typical Cops & Killer movie and not a bad one at that...the story is the typical corrupt police officer framing members of his team for his crimes (drugs, etc.) and eventually killing a lot of them...the film mostly focuses on the fake martial artist Jackie Cheung...he should stick to singing, but he does get off some pretty good moves in this one...I just wish Donnie had the spotlight a lot more...his fight scene(yes there is only one) was one reason I decided to get this dvd...he has yet another fight with Michael Woods and company and it is truly awesome...When it comes down to it, this is just a brutally violent movie...lots of killing, and lots of weaponry beatings...the martial art greats of course come from Donnie, but Jackie shows some here and there...well worth a watch, your choice if you want to keep it...overall rating = 3.5
Now TIGER CAGE 2...this is no sequel to the original, but its hell of a lot better...this time Donnie is the main guy, and what you get here is a modern martial arts extravaganza as there are many throughout the film and they are all great...this is by far one of Donnie's greatest movies...one of the greatest fight scene I have ever seen is present in this with Donnie's fight with Michael Woods (yet again) and the main bad guy (he's pretty good too...forgot name)...the story is about a woman (the ever so beautiful Rosamund Kwan) who gets caught in the middle of a dirty money scam...the badies think she took the money, and all the while, Donnie Yen (a retired cop) is present at the scene as well...Anyways, they both end up together and both are the run as they become suspects of a murder...so like most action films, they end up trying to figure out the real case behind all of this...other than being one of the greatest fighting flick, this is one of the funniest as well...the interactions between Donnie and Rosamund are just hilarious...Donnie has a lot of impatience for Rosamund's stubborn character...This dvd is from what I hear extremely tough to find, but I got mine eBay, and there seems to an abundance there, but mostly overseas...the quality is decent enough and the sound is dbd 5.1 (pretty good at that too)... TIGER CAGE 1 is about same quality as well. Obviously, I'm recommending a buy even if you haven't seen it, it's just that awesome...If you want to see a great Donnie movie, this is one of his best and one of THE best martial arts flick ever caught on camera...yuen woo ping's choreography is one of his best work here...can't praise it enough, you gotta get this...Overall rating = 5+...Can't say much for Tiger Cage 3 except Donnie isn't even in this one which is reason enough of why I didn't check it out...woo ping does choreography for this one too, but it looks more like a shooter film...ah well...other Donnie greats are of course Iron Monkey, OUATIC II along side Jet Li, Drunken Tai Chi, Wing Chun along side beauty Michelle Yeoh...hope this HK review was helpful, check out my others too...laters",1015545600,2,3395,4.6318407960199
7889079,4,6305371687,"Considering this movie was produced over a decade ago...I guess its safe to say that its pretty good (well, I kept my eyes mostly on Donnie Yen, and he's very good!!)
It's a typical Cop-Story, of fellow cops backstabbing and framing each other over drugs, but I'll admit, all the actors/actress are exceptionally terrific in this movie. The story is done just right; enough drama to keep me in suspense throughout the entire movie (I could actually feel their emotional pain.) There's alot of gun firing (and I mean alot) and also lots of killings and blood, so it's certainly action-packed.
And of course, great martial arts (Yuen Woo-Ping and Donnie Yen always put together the best of fighting scenes!) Donnie Yen shows off more of his US boxing skills...and WOW...he is so fast! And the end to this movie is also done well, nothing in the storyline is left unfinished so you'll feel completely satisfied.",983318400,4,908,4.826923076923077
7889080,4,6305371687,"This movie is great, but check out tiger cage II...not a sequel tho...this is where donnie yen showcases his amazing kicks, and he was the action choreographer also...along w/other movies...this guy is just multi  talented.  and...great acting...one of the funniest donnie yen roles you'll  ever see.",953683200,2,300,5.478260869565218
7889081,4,6305371687,This is a gritty and tough HK crooked cop movie and certainly not for everyone.  But if you like action and don't mind a little blood this one will not disappoint.  Donnie Yen is one of the best martial artists around.  Simon Yam always delivers a strong performance and Do Do Cheng is as  beautiful and tough as ever. Just ignore Jacky Cheung's usual over-acting.,924048000,5,364,4.553846153846154
