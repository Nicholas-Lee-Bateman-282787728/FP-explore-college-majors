1428604,2,B00005J75L,these movies did not come in color as shown and was very fuzzy not good quality.  but too much trouble to pay to return.  but i have learned my lesson.,1360627200,2,151,4.0
1428605,5,B00005J75L,They put together some of the best for this collection. Enjoy this show for good old fashion fun that the whole family watch together!,1358553600,2,134,4.625
1428606,5,B00005J75L,"What can I say? As an aging Baby - Boomer this is a treat to watch these classic episodes again and again. They are all there. We can catch them on the tube, but to sit in bed watching them on your portable DVD player brings back a wave of memories of when they first aired and life was so much simplier and you had to get up off the floor and change the channel. Yes, I do feel guilty watching them in bed on a portable player.",1357084800,6,428,3.875
1428607,5,B00005J75L,"How fun to watch this dvd!!  There are so many little play on words that I missed being younger watching this series on tv.  Now, as an older adult, I find myself laughing at all the play on words and fun they must have had making this series!!!  The quality and sound of the dvd is great!  It is interesting to watch the very first show that was aired and then watch how their opening and closing progressed.  I love it!!!",1330041600,6,423,4.172839506172839
1428608,1,B00005J75L,Now Mill Creek has jumped on the Hillbilly bandwagon.  I bet this is another release of the same PD episodes which have been circulating on the home video market for years.  Sadly it seems like the official season sets have dried up - poor sales????,1311984000,,249,4.511111111111111
1428609,5,B00005J75L,"Very funny quality family classic humor. This show is just good clean fun, not the kind of crap we find on TV primetime now. Might be a little silly but it is great for kids and adults alike.",1212969600,,191,4.052631578947368
1428610,2,B00005J75L,"This was a quickie put together by a company which could not get liscense to the theme song of the BH. So that snappy little tune we like to sing along to is gone. The DVD menus are terrible and you can barely read the font. However, once you get past all of this and into the actual shows - they are great and uncut. Please know these are all B/W episodes - about 5 on each the discs for a total of 10 shows as I recall. But it if you are a die hard fan and need some hillbilly slapstick - otherwise, with hope the studio will release a quality version of these American treasures.",1019692800,5,582,3.982905982905983
1428611,5,B00005J75L,I love the t.v. show The Beverly Hillbillies.  An old great show!,1427932800,,65,4.416666666666667
1428612,5,B00005J75L,Only watched first two dvds so far (there's a lot of eps.) Only drawback no playall feature. But great quality for over 50 year old show. Brought me back to my tbs childhood.,1417564800,2,174,4.303030303030303
1428613,3,B00005J75L,"it was alway a good show,but..for the price you pay..they didn;t clean up the video..look like 1960;s  still filming it..if you realy like the show find the master copys of this shows..paul",1409356800,,189,4.90625
1428614,5,B00005J75L,"For the money spent, this is a lot of bang for the buck. 40 episodes from the first 2 seasons of the show, these are the public domain prints, and no, this issue does not have the original theme music. That said, the shows featured here are just plain laugh out loud funny. Like many shows, The Beverly Hillbillies was best in it's early years. No, these are not in color, but the quality of the writing was far superior IMO, than the later, color shows. For those who are curious, the theme tune has been replaced with one called ""Banjo Signal"" , reportedly played by one of The Dillards of Andy Griffith fame.",1408838400,2,611,4.368421052631579
1428615,1,B00005J75L,"It says its the Beverly Hillbillies TV series 1962-1971 and all it was was 4 shows. Two of which were 1962 the other 2 were 1963. Not the series, which is what I had wanted.",1392854400,17,173,3.9714285714285715
1428616,4,B00005J75L,"Actor were great,permorance is very very good. All did very well as being a family and having a great time together.",1391990400,,116,4.571428571428571
1428617,1,B00005J75L,"Expected more from this DVD, it was only four episodes!!
Spend a few extra dollars and get the full  or expanded set.",1377216000,9,117,4.318181818181818
1428618,5,B00005J75L,"I bought this for my Amish friends to see on my T.V., and I watched it with them.  They laughed and enjoyed every episode.",1375747200,,122,4.083333333333333
1428619,3,B00005J75L,It was incomplete but ok. Quality was ok too. The price alright as well. It's a good introduction for younger audiences.,1372032000,2,120,4.761904761904762
1428620,3,B00005J75L,"It is the way the company shipped the DVD that made me want to cringe when I opened the envelope.
I received the DVD in a small cardboard box which was stuffed in a manila envelope. The box was crush and flattened. I thought that I might have to return the DVD because I felt that the DVD may have been shattered , I did not feel a hard plastic case in the box that usually accompanies a DVD to protect it. In fact, the crushed DVD box looked as if someone removed the DVD and replaced it in the box without the case, if there was one. I picked up the box and the DVD rolled right out.of the left side of the box on to the floor.  You may now have a picture in your mind. I proceeded to examine the DVD for finger prints, breaks and scratches  because it may have been a used DVD, There were none ,thank G.
Since I was more interested in the survival of the DVD, I discarded the box and played the DVD for playability. It was working with no skips. I have extra plastic DVD cases to store this DVD. There was no need to return the DVD.
Conclusion: If the box containing the DVD with the graphic art and information on it or the plastic case is a necessity. Don't buy this DVD. I was lucky to have a spare plastic DVD case to store the remains.

UPDATE 5/2/13
It would also been nice of the company to tell customers what shows or episodes are on this DVD to help customers make a decision whether or not to purchase. Customers may already have these episodes in their library. Well I guess this company is not interested in their customers. ALSO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE OF AMAZON TO TELL THEIR CUSTOMERS THE DVD WAS USED.
I will be donating this DVD to a Charity and buy myself the full Beverly Hillbillies Collection. Oops! Just read reviews on this collection. I'm not buying this either. I will wait until someone provides the entire Beverly Hillbillies series from season 1 to the end, has an excellent picture quality transfer and with all the original music scores. Other than that , Beverly HB will not be part of my library collection.

So, here are the 4 shows I found ON THIS DVD:

PYMALION AND ELLY (11/28/62)
ELLY RACES JETHRINE (12/5/62)
JED PAYS SOLOMON (12/13/63)
CHICKADEE RETURNS (11/6/63)",1366243200,15,2206,4.306024096385542

7938549,3,B00005J75L,"I THOUGHT SEASON6 WAS ON THAT DVD , THE EPISODE WAS CALLED THE DINER WHICH WAS NOT ON THE DVD,THEY CLAIMED IT WAS BUT WAS NOT. I SAW IT ON TV AND I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY FUNNY.I THEN LOOKED IT UP ON SEASON 7 BUT IT WAS NOT ON THERE.",1464998400,,230,3.5294117647058822
7938550,5,B00005J75L,"Not the kind of copy you will get from buying the later seasons in color but these earlier b+w seasons are 3 times as funny. This is the TRUE Beverly Hillbillies. I can watch these dvd's over and over. These episodes appeared on television many years ago and their style of humor is very corny but that is exactly why I love them. I get stressed out pretty easy and ""Meet The Clampetts"" is some of the best medicine I can find for brightening my day. This is probably the best purchase I have made in the last year or two. The price is so affordable that I bought an extra copy to make sure I get my dose of The Beverly Hillbillies for many years to come. I hope you enjoy ""Meet The Clampetts"" half as much as I do.",1456272000,2,715,4.078014184397163

This 'documentary' is Perfect - for anyone who is a Dolt, Dullard or Moron - who has Never heard of the
Beverly Hillbillies. - It is hosted by some Unknown older guy and peppered with clips of the show - that
burn up precious (potential) documentary time. - So - if you're and Idiot - and Can't even figure out what the show is
(primarily) about - by the cover and theme song - then - this piece of crap documentary - might be for you! (Avoid!!) Scott M.",1438905600,2,548,4.330097087378641
