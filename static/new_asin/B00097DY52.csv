2269771,5,B00097DY52,"I never realized how many young & older men lost their lives, from both sides of the war in this most horrific & challenging time, which took place in the North Atlantic. Hitler, as a military man, during WWII, has never looked or appeared as a credible military planner, ever, however, with his orders to the ongoing U-Boat fleets, this almost made him appear as a, reasonably intelligent military strategist. After watching this DVD, I was amazed at how difficult this time in history was for all of those who gallantly fought and defended their country of England, as that sadistic and ego-centric Austrian dictator, Adolph Hitler, made it almost a ""death wish,"" for any sailor or maritime worker, sailing through that area, during that time. Hitler's plan to starve England into submission, almost worked, were it not for the thousands and thousands of brave men that not only gave their lives for the cause but for all of the men that made it possible for ships to sail into the ports of England and to unload their goods, to feed a country that was destined to fall to its knees and give in to Adolph, the sadistic and ruthless dictator, of Austria...The Battle of the Atlantic, is must-see footage, for every fan & historian of WWII...",1353715200,2,1242,4.728110599078341
2269772,3,B00097DY52,"This reviewer's main complaint with this DVD set is that it is too rudimnetary of an introduction, esepcially considering the fact that it is three hours in length. The DVD offers a good overview of the human component of the war, from both the German and allied perspective, but unfortunately is too rudimentary in its coverage of just about everything else even though it does, at least, touch upon the major aspects of the war. These include, for example, German tactics and how they changed over the course of the war, various technologies such as radar and direction finding and their role in the conflict and the role of code breaking (from the perspective of both sides), among other things. Unfortunately, these topics were only touched upon. Graphics and animation of any kind would have also have been very useful in the DVD (i.e., illustrating German surface attacks, allied ""creeping"" counter submarine attacks or air attacks) but unfortunately these are sorely missing. Other topics, such as the race between the destruction and construction of merchant vessels, which was at the core of this battle, are barely even touched upon either. All and all a DVD, despite its considerable length of three hours, that is just too rudimentary. This is despite its relatively high production value.

For those interested in a more in-depth analysis (and more black and white footage from the time, something that again, this DVD does not have enough of in this reviewer's opinion), this reviewer recommends the War Archive Collection DVD set consisting of three DVDs, ""Grey Wolves: U-boats 1939-1941"", ""Grey Wolves: U-boats 1942-1943"" and""Grey Wolves: U-Boats 1943-1945"". Although these DVDs have a much lower budget than the BBC series, they contain much more sophisticated narrative analysis albeit in the form of a dull monotone English accent. Plus there is considerably more contemporary B&W footage of these craft. This reviewer also highly recommends the book, by Gordon Williamson, ""U-Boat Tactics in WW II"". Although only a very short book (64 pages, about a third of which are illustration), it gives a very good introduction to the topic and one that is more in-depth than that presented in this DVD series.",1313366400,9,2221,5.118457300275482
2269773,4,B00097DY52,Interesting review of the WW-II fight to keep supplies flowing across the Atlantic to Britian. Interviews with the actual sailors involved as well as filmed action help show the ebb and flow of which nation held the upper hand.,1302825600,,227,4.846153846153846
2269774,5,B00097DY52,"This is an excellent documentary that I strongly recommend.  I have seen this on television with an American narrator, but this video has an English narrator who I think really adds a lot to the ""feel"" of the movie.  Since the Battle of the Atlantic was about protecting the lifeline to Great Britain, it just seems more appropriate to me to have an English narrator.  The movie is full of excellent footage from the period, as well as interviews with combatants on both sides.",1294704000,11,477,4.654761904761905
2269775,5,B00097DY52,This was incredible ...I had NEVER realised the Sacrifice the Merchant Navy(Marine)had paid in WW2 ...it blew me away how descriptive the HORROR of being Torpedoed was...That the Human Body and Mind can endure so much is mindboggling.....and a Testament to the DIVINITY of the SOUL.,1283299200,4,282,5.1521739130434785
2269776,5,B00097DY52,"I think that this dvd gives good insight into the hearts and minds of those who braved the frigid waters,and share with us their memories. I would recommend this to anyone interested in the war.",1222473600,4,194,4.571428571428571
2269777,4,B00097DY52,This BBC production is part of the excellent series of historical programs that british television has produced on the second world war. The material is written and produced by Andrew Williams and I have read the book which he published on the same subject. In one hour and a half it is not possible to cover all aspects of the subject so that the focus is on the duel between U-Boat command and the Royal Navy. In addition there is a fascinating section on the role of the codebreakers at Bletchley park who broke the German Enigma-machine code and were able to anticipate the U-Boat movements. The human cost of this struggle was horrendous  with great loss of of life on both sides and this DVD shows the tradegy of war with no punches pulled. There are interviews with seamen on both sides which add enormously to the impact of the program. I would recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in history.,1169769600,30,910,4.548780487804878
2269778,4,B00097DY52,"Probably as trueful picture as can be shown of German underseas warfare. Scenes were very authenic. It is just another historical insight to WWII.

Very well done.",1168300800,4,163,5.037037037037037
8058151,4,B00097DY52,"This BBC video provides a good starting point for those wanting to understand the war in the Atlantic.

Strong Points and notable items covered.:

Good overall coverage of the war in the Atlantic but almost exclusively as it relates to U-Boats, merchant ships and anti U-Boat operations.
Excellent interviews of German, British and (some) American sailors/veterans.
Good overall coverage of both the British and German code breaking successes and how this related to U-Boats and convoys.
Coverage of the capture of U-110 with its enigma machine and code books.
Coverage of the Laconia incident and Admiral Karl Doenitz's memo which ordered that U-Boats stop taking risks to pick-up ship survivors.
Coverage of Capt Johnnie Walker, anti-submarine escort operations and treatment of U-Boats crew survivors.
Coverage of operations in the Bay of Biscay, closing the Atlantic air gap with bombers and Operation Drum Beat off the US East Coast.
Coverage of the use of snorkels, convoy systems and merchant ship production.
Coverage of U-Boat supply ships and Milkcow submarines.
Basic coverage of aircraft Leigh Lights and radar.
Limited coverage of use of ship radar and Asdic

Weak points and notable items missing:

No coverage on the use of catapult fighters from merchant ships.
Limited coverage of the independent U-boat hunter groups and the use of jeep carriers.
Various pieces of film footage were shown of aircraft attacks on U-boats that is attributed to land based bombers, but by the amount of firepower used it looked like some came from carrier based aircraft.
Limited coverage of the US Navy and no coverage of the capture of U-505.
Video case cover shows a German Navy S-boat on patrol but the video almost exclusively covers the German Navy use of submarines.

I rate this item 4 out of 5 stars with more strengths than weaknesses, but agree with the other reviewers who have noted other documentaries  provide more specific information and details.",1524268800,,1961,5.150943396226415

This series is in the same tradition.

You'd think the History Channel would want to aspire to these heights.",1475107200,,228,4.428571428571429
8058155,4,B00097DY52,"Not a great documentary but I would recommend it to anyone interested in how the U-Boats came close to defeating the British, and how the British and Americans then defeated the U-Boats..",1461024000,,187,4.875
8058156,5,B00097DY52,"This is the best study of the Battle of the Atlantic that I have seen.  I was completely absorbed intellectually and emotionally.  The footage is the best quality available from the archives.  The narration is very well done and there is haunting music from time to time.

The discussion of U-boat tactics and allied tactics is very informative  and there is a program made up completely of discussions with  survivors of the battle from both sides which is also informative as well as  emotionally hard-hitting.

I have purchased a number of documentaries of World War II and of those dealing with the Battle of the Atlantic this is by far the best.  It is far superior to the series called Grey Wolves and my review of it is under Grey Wolves on Amazon.",1431820800,5,755,4.616541353383458
8058157,5,B00097DY52,"Excellent documentary on the Battle of the Atlantic.  This is the best documentary I've ever seen on the fight for control of the Atlantic and actually one of the better documentaries on WWII.  Excellent, bit leisurely on the first disc but the 2 following disc are even better - about 2.5 hours long.  Highly recommended for anyone that wants a better understanding of the role that the U-boats played and the fight to beat them including the role of the enigma machine.  Very informative and surprisingly good.",1431302400,,512,4.850574712643678
