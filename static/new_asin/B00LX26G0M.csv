6509002,5,B00LX26G0M,"If you're someone like me who went into this, knowing who Houdini was, but not knowing very much about him, this is a great jumping off point. I have a list of several books about Houdini that are available at my local library that I will be checking out at some point to get a more in depth perspective. The History Channel has been putting on some good mini series movies and this was not a let down. It was visual stunning, and I think Adrien Brody did a great job",1409961600,11,467,4.142857142857143
6509003,5,B00LX26G0M,"I watched this on the History Channel two day event and I loved it! It really dug deep down into the life and mindset of The Great Houdini. It is the best TV show by far and I can't wait to get it on DVD! Whoever says it was ""emotionally lacking"" or a ""ridiculous remake"" is clearly wrong. Words cannot even describe how amazing this movie is! I loved this so much, that I even download History Channel on my Kindle and watched it over and over again! 5 stars isn't even enough, so here's a few more **********************. Great job to Adrien Brody, Kristen Connolly and Evan Jones.",1409961600,3,583,4.3577981651376145
6509004,4,B00LX26G0M,"First off, I freely admit I'm a serious Adrien Brody fan - so this was a must-see (and must-buy) for me. Saw part 2 last night when it aired and I'm about to purchase it.

WARNING: some slight spoilers.

The good: the suspense was well done. You know he isn't going to die, because it's a biopic - but it doesn't matter. The anticipation is fantastic. Brody is in great physical condition (in line with the real Houdini). I was also fascinated to learn that Houdini was a spy; all I knew about him were his famous escapes, his scepticism on the supernatural, and the way he died prior to this biopic.

The not so good: Kristen Connolly seemed very one-dimensional as his wife; the fatal stomach punch used over and over as both actual and metaphor for Houdini's issues throughout life was obvious and overused; aspects of Houdini's life, such as more than superficial descriptions about his relationships with those closest to him, could have been better explored.",1409702400,,964,4.6923076923076925
6509005,5,B00LX26G0M,"This was a great movie on the history channel, I really enjoyed it, and thought was really entertaining.  A lot of people were complaining that this movie wasn't a documentary and that the movie was totally inaccurate. I knew nothing about Houdini before seeing this movie and found out after watching that there is a lot of stuff that is accurate and some inaccurate ( mostly dates and times) but it really doesn't matter to me, and who cares. This movie is outstanding if you want to see these magic tricks and the life of Harry Houdini as an escape artist. These defying acts are very nicely done and even keeps you at the edge of your seat sometimes. Highly recommended!",1409702400,3,674,4.570247933884297
6509006,5,B00LX26G0M,"Watched the History Channel shortened version of this. Quite interesting! Began with his childhood, show how he became devoted to his mother, early magic tricks paired with this brother, marriage, and then on to becoming an escape artist. Most interesting of all, it shows how most of his escapes/tricks were accomplished, except for making an elephant disappear. (See Wikipedia for the details.) Near the end of his life Houdini took it upon himself to expose mediums. The tale of his death, unfortunately, is not accurate.",1409616000,4,524,5.176470588235294
6509007,5,B00LX26G0M,Its awsome !  Im loving everything about this movie showings how he preformed his allusions and h only w he would clean uo jis mistakes.  And how much he loved his mother.

6509008,1,B00LX26G0M,"Like many fans of Harry Houdini who have been longing for a decent film about his life, I wanted to view this with an open mind. To my dismay, ""Houdini""  follows the pattern set by the previous string of disappointing Houdini biopics, the most major sin being that invented situations are favored in place of actual fact. With a screenplay based on a 1976 book that sought to psychoanalyze the great magician rather than tell his story, this film is perhaps the most disrespectful and historically inaccurate attempt yet, and is not only an insult to his memory, but also to anyone who knows anything about his life.

One would think that a three-hour format would allow some extra wiggle room for Houdini's life to be properly dramatized, and (finally) give a deeper picture of the man and his times, yet oddly enough, the opposite is true. The most interesting, important, or character-building events of his life and career are changed, shifted around in time, or thrown out altogether in favor of giving precedence to completely invented scenes and situations. Rather than tackle his life as it happened, screenwriter Nicholas Meyers prefers to treat Houdini as a fictional character inhabiting a semi-realistic history of his own creation. While I'll concede his writer's prerogative to ad-lib, as is almost always necessary to do when filling in the blanks of what actually happened, Meyers goes completely overboard, literally rewriting history in every possible way to suit his script when it should be the other way around.

If this film had been presented as fiction from the outset, I wouldn't have had a problem with it. But when you start passing off that fiction as honest fact, not to mention that it was premiered on a network titled HISTORY, then you start bringing up a major ethical problem: when you start rewriting history, eventually people will start believing it. This has already proved true in the case of the 1953 ""Houdini"", which has single-handedly perpetrated the myth that Houdini drowned while performing his Water Torture Cell. No doubt this film will only add to the already long list of Hollywood-created misconceptions about Houdini. Although I will give this film credit as the first to depict Houdini's death accurately, they pander to the drowning myth with the inclusion of a scene of him nearly drowning while practicing and having to be axed out, something that NEVER happened to him during his many years performing the stunt.

Historical accuracy aside, the script is chock-full of inanely on-the-nose dialogue that never even tries to capture the cadence of the time-period and only contributes to the overall soapy quality of the performances. There is zero character development, and the personalities that emerge are more cardboard than flesh and blood.

Adrien Brody might be a good actor in other roles, but as the great illusionist he is something of a mismatch. Physically, being nearly a foot taller than the real Houdini makes the idea of him being a great acrobat somewhat ridiculous. With his lean face and puppy-dog expressions, it's hard to equate him with the slight, smiling showman that Houdini really was. His nasally Brooklyn accent makes him sound more like a member of the Mob than a Hungarian-born kid who spent his formative years in Wisconsin and New York, and his sleepy, brooding demeanor doesn't gel with Houdini's well-documented passion, charisma, and almost hyper-active energy. Most of the fault is, again, due to the script, which takes great liberties with Houdini's personality, leaving how Brody's Houdini managed to achieve the success he did as the greatest mystery of all.

Once again, the character of Houdini's wife Bess is given short-shrift. Kristen Connolly is the closest match physically to the real Bess we've seen on film (again disregarding the height discrepancy), though she never manages to make her likeable, a consequence of the abysmal script. Instead of the lively, loving, and steadfast partner that Bess was in real life, we get a shallow, nagging, unsupportive, and slightly dim-witted woman who always seems to be opposed to her husband and has to turn to drugs and alcohol to get through the day. There is absolutely no chemistry between her and Brody, which, when combined with the lack of personality or character development, left what ought to be the major emotional thread of the film hanging.

Even with these fumbles, this still could have been a fairly good film, if not for the filmmakers' preoccupation with giving every scene some psychological double-meaning. To this end, there is an overabundance of frankly weird and slightly trippy effects: fast, jerky cuts, an intrusive voice-over that dominates the first half of the story, and a melodramatic, oft-repeated gut-punch every time something traumatic happens to Houdini that, through the help of CGI, goes so far as to show the muscles and organs themselves. John Debney's electronic-heavy and unsettling score also adds to this slightly nightmarish atmosphere.

But this is only the half of it. Meyers has a constant preoccupation with giving Houdini a complex on everything, his means of explaining Houdini's fascination with escape and his compulsion to be a success. Strangely, in trying to go deeper, we end up being given a ridiculously shallow portrait of the man, which only makes it harder to understand what it was made him so unique. This device is most flagrantly apparent in the exaggeration of Houdini's relationship with his mother, Cecilia Weiss, a sloppy and frankly lazy choice on Meyers' part. If he had cared to do a little more research on 20th century culture and Houdini himself, he might have better understood that while he was deeply devoted to her, in that period, being a ""mama's boy"" was expected and could exist without Oedipal undertones. Suffice to say, as portrayed in the film, you couldn't get much more Freudian with it, and the scenes that result are, in a word, disturbing. Not only is this disrespectful to both their memories, it also effectively saps screen-time that might have been better used to develop Houdini's other relationships.

But what is even worse is the filmmakers' decision to do a lurid expose in vivid CGI of all of Houdini's escapes. Besides being in poor taste, it also effectively breaks the code of any magician's society, and amounts to something near sacrilege. Houdini must be rolling over in his grave. While most devoted Houdini fans have a rudimentary idea of how he effected them, do we really want to know? These intermittent forays break up the flow of the story and strips the film of any magic or wonder it might have had, the only exception being the Vanishing Elephant which is, thankfully, not explained.

What disappoints the most is that despite all the reverence and admiration still felt for the master mystifyer almost 90 years after his death, no one seems to be able to bring themselves to make a decent film about him. If you don't know a thing about Houdini, this film isn't going to help you, as most of it is complete poppycock. If you do know something about him, don't sport with your intelligence by watching it. As pure entertainment, ""Houdini"" might appeal to some, but overall, it is simply too much of a fantasy to qualify as a true biopic. My advice: Just pick up a book about him, or watch Harvey Keitel's amazing performance as Houdini in ""Fairytale"" (1997).",1409529600,23,7426,4.986279257465698

Part two in turn comes to a surprisingly emotional ending and all in all I'd say this mini series has more than enough interesting trivia to keep even casual views entertained.

Even though it is a lovely film , the liberties taken during the most dramatic moments are simply  wrong or totally fictitious. We have seen this before , many times ""Bridge on the River Kwai and U-571"" comes to mind among  many others however this is the History Channel!  Houdini had a colorful life with interesting events that just scream drama. Instead the Producers have chosen to go Hollywood . This production should have elevated the History Channel as well as entertained the public in an accurate manner . I bought it for 5.00 and i see it selling well under half of the suggested list on several sites. That says a lot. The price was fair but it is still sad that such networks like the History Chanel and A&E when faced with the possibility of producing a quality project they still come out short.

6509037,5,B00LX26G0M,"Adrien Brody (The Darjeeling Limited,The Grand Budapest Hotel) portrays the famed performer,as we see him as the young immigrant Erich Weiss living his boyhood in Appleton,Wisconsin; he is inspired by magician Robert Houdin to pursue a life in the art of prestidigitation,his now-legendary stage name also inspired by him. With his wife Bess (Kristin Connolly) by his side,he begins his career in vaudeville,but his dedication and prowess to the art soon lift him to international status...which eventually leads to the British government seeking his services as a spy,using his fame to get close to the inner circle of the Kaiser. We later see a constantly changing world threatening to rob him of his audience,so he resorts to life-threatening escapes to regain them. When Houdini's mother dies,he believes he can contact her in the spirit world,but this results in his crusade to debunk the multitude of phony spiritualists operating at the time,one of whom may have been the wife of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (David Calder),a firm believer in the world of the supernatural.
Brody portrays Houdini as a man who seems to live his life as a series of obsessions,many of which threaten to become obstacles between him and the people in his life. The world of late-nineteenth/early-twentieth stage magic is a wonder to behold here,as the mechanics of many of Houdini's illusions and escapes are shown. It's amazing how much of this foreshadows the tragic circumstances under which Houdini ultimately met his demise. Writer Nicholas Meyer (The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,Star Trek VI:The Undiscovered Country) and director Uli Edel (Last Exit To Brooklyn,The Mists Of Avalon) have certainly created a unique and entertaining depiction of Harry Houdini.",1437868800,3,1744,5.322463768115942
6509038,3,B00LX26G0M,"I am forgiving to a fault about fiction in Houdini biopics. I understand that time needs to be compressed and conflict needs to be generated for purposes of drama. All the Houdini biopics of the past, such as the wonderful 1953 Houdini biopic starring Tony Curtis, have done this. But those biopics still adhere to the basic superstructure of Houdini's life and career in a respectful way. A basic summary of these biopics will still give you the basic story of Houdini.

Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this latest version of the Houdini story, at least not in the first part of this two-part miniseries from HISTORY. When Houdini's real life doesn't fit screenwriter Nicholas Meyers fictions, he changes the life. The real story of how Houdini found success -- a key component in the life story of any entertainer -- is completely thrown out in favor of a single ""Johnson County"" jail break in 1896. Houdini then springs fully formed as the ""most famous man in America"" by 1900. This is so far from the truth it's shocking.

Meyer's other offenses are more fundamental and just plain sloppy. He misspells Houdini's real name as Erich (it's Ehrich). He presents the Water Torture Cell as Houdini's first major stage escape. Not just horrendously wrong, but it effectively erases the entire progression of Houdini's art and career. He places Houdini's home in Brooklyn instead of Harlem. Houdini was a cinema pioneer. Meyer makes him a cinema holdout. Houdini was a famous teetotaler. Meyer shows him drunk. Superimposed titles are used throughout to locate the action, yet not a single one is accurate. Why use locators if they are not identifying something real? What kills me is Meyer just seems to take the approach that the truth doesn't matter. The truth is what works for him at the moment. The entire thing feels lazy, arrogant, and even amateur.

But it soon becomes clear why Meyer so badly mangles the facts of Houdini's early life. Because at minute 40, Washington sends Houdini off to Europe as a secret agent. Now, this 2004 theory that Houdini did ""spy"" work is HIGHLY dubious and should never have been included in something that purports to be a biopic. But Hollywood cannot resist a spy movie, and this silliness dominates and, for me at least, ruins Part I.

But then comes Part II, which, finally free of the hackneyed spy elements, is MUCH better. There finally seems to be an effort on Meyers part to tell Houdini's real story. The details of Houdini's death, while dramatically time compressed, are largely accurate. Houdini doesnt die in the Water Torture Cell, and thats a first for a Houdini biopic. And the actors finally get to play dramatic scenes without the incessant voice over and hyperactive editing effects. I just wish whatever hand guided this second part was present during the first.

In fact, if you make your peace with the inaccuracies and watch this as a tale told by an unreliable narrator -- ""with just enough truth to make you believe the lies"" -- it can be enjoyable. The production design is magnificant. Adrien Brody, a poor physical match for Houdini, delivers an excellent performance and projects a charisma that he surely shares with The Handcuff King. And the beautiful Kristen Connolly is wonderful as Bess.

One thing I would highly recommend is watching the extended version on this DVD, not the TV version that aired on the History Channel. It's the much better version of HOUDINI.

The film shows Houdini doing his tricks and it shows how he accomplished them. He is the most famous magician and escape artist of our times and his name is still famous almost 100 years after his death.

I found the way he developed and did his escapes and tricks to be fascinating and multiple times he barely escaped death doing some of them. This is a good film and I recommend it if you are a Harry Houdini fan. It is worth watching.",1414886400,11,1017,4.31413612565445

6509062,3,B00LX26G0M,"As a piece of entertainment, this is a good work. As a piece of history, it is really disappointing.

The cast is good. I love Adrien Brody, but why cast him in this? Houdini was a short, squat, brick. His physicality was a big part of who he was. Why go against that and choose Brody?

This movie pitches itself as a psychological portrait, yet it fails on that account as well. Houdini wasn't a likable guy. He was paranoid and driven by insecurity. That is not even hinted at here.

This movie shows Houdini as a loved, successful magician. It ignores decades when he was literally starving. Don't you think that poverty and hunger was a powerful force in shaping his personality? Shouldn't that have been mentioned?

The story alludes to conflict with the father, yet it never gets into that. Lost potential.

There are many things like that that make you just want to shake your head IF you are looking for history. It's sad that the writers had so much great material to work with and chose to portray something completely different.",1414800000,7,1039,4.594594594594595

Horrible! Awful! Colossally BAD!

Please don't waste 3 hours of your life (that you will never get back) on this wretched piece of drivel.

My fascination with Houdini began back in the 1970's; when Doug Henning toured the television air with his magic act devoted to the memory of Houdini. Since then I have devoured any biography of him. I wrote college papers on his impact on theatre history & Vaudeville. I have a bust of him in my living room. Theatre posters of his appearances hang in my office cube. I have a complete set of his silent films on DVD along with disks & tapes of the various biopics & documentaries devoted to him - so, I had to purchase the miniseries produced for cable in 2014 to maintain my collection (I mean, I even have ""Moonraker"" in my Bond collection!).

I have pages of notes of inaccuracies and lies that screenwriter Nicholas Meyer has committed upon the self-styled myths & legacy of Houdini. I won't go into them. Well, maybe the few that are most egregious...

Most offensive is Meyer's portrayal of Houdini's wife Bess as a drunk, dope-smoking anti-Semite. Meyer writes Houdini as a shallow man who has various affairs while spying for the US Government before & during the Great War, as if he were Sidney Reilly or Maugham's Ashenden - totally unsubstantiated by fact, or even rumor. And he choses to make the unfortunate circumstance of Houdini's death from peritonitis, complicated by a burst appendix, into a bizarre assassination at the hand (or fist) of a zealot of Spiritualism, bent on revenge for Houdini's campaign against that ""religion.""

Dramatic license is no excuse for these insults. Christopher Nolan made a picture about a magician in competition with himself and the supernatural, made between ""Batmans"" including the mysteries & myth surrounding Nikola Tesla. Called ""The Illusionist,"" it was silly - but it was made with style. ""Houdini"" has none. A period story shot like a MTV video, with baaad VFX and jump-cutting, with CSI-like microscopy (WTF?!). And contemporary right down to Adrien Brody's post-millennial New York accent & style of speech.

There are recordings of Houdini's voice. He spoke with a showman's grandeur, accompanied by Elgar's ""Pomp & Circumstance"" whenever he took the stage. The score SUCKS! It is wall-to-wall (there are 2 volumes of it for sale on iTunes) and it sounds like it was written for a ""Bourne"" movie... I can't believe it came from John Debney.

What a mess! And what a waste of money!",1413417600,12,2530,4.894859813084112
6509065,3,B00LX26G0M,"I might take some whacks for this, but it is just an okay piece of entertainment.  Adrien Brody is a good actor, but I think he was miscast in this role.  There really is a lack of emotional magic to the characters.  When the History Channel does these films, they really should try to make them more like that actual time period and not dumb it down to today's standards.  I believe people are intelligent enough to understand those time periods.  Houdini never said, You tried to play me---.  People in the 1920's didn't talk like that.  This was the first time I ever heard of Houdini's wife being a pothead.  I also didn't know that his best friend and partner Jim Collins who helped create many of his tricks and illusions, just idolized and fawned over him like a lover.  His life was interesting enough and if there was more of likeable emotional feel to the show I would have appreciated it more.  If would be a good watch for Adrien Brody fans though.",1413072000,9,960,4.434285714285714
6509066,5,B00LX26G0M,"This was an enjoyable TV miniseries. The film follows Houdini (Adrien Brody) from childhood fascination with magic and the support he got from his loving mother. He marries Bess (Kristen Connolly) which was a less than idea marriage. The film shows you how Houdini did his tricks...except for maybe that one thing.

Houdini was like Madonna, in that he was constantly trying to re-invent himself in order to stay on top. We would see where his ideas would come from, which most likely were dramatizations. The film touches on his infidelity and goes into detail on his mission as a spy and as a debunk-er of Mediums.

Adrien Brody looked extremely buff for the part.

No F-bombs or nudity. Brief sex scenes. One scene takes place in a brothel. Available at Redbox.",1412812800,2,764,4.7727272727272725

6509068,5,B00LX26G0M,"Review of content.

A thoroughly engaging performance by Adrien Brody lifts this stylishly-made biographical mini-series to a whole other level. Harry Houdini - born Erik Weisz in Budapest - starts out as a travelling magician, eventually teaming up with craftsman Jim Collins to create astonishing feats of escape which wowed audiences in the early 20th century. His powers of endurance were legendary and it's fascinating to see the truth behind the tricks as well as the unfolding story of Houdini's life - including forays into espionage and the debunking of spiritualism. How true this all is, obviously I cannot say - but it makes for highly entertaining viewing. The real magic here is that Adrien Brody *becomes* Houdini and the greatest compliment one can pay him is that one is not aware that he is acting. Bravo Brody!",1411257600,4,829,5.007246376811594
6509069,5,B00LX26G0M,"Award winning Adrien Brody does this movie beyond justice. After watching the Pianist years ago who wouldn't be a fan? In this mini series he plays the main role of Houdini on the History Channel and he was exceptional!

Overall: The storyline is mainly about his international stardom focusing on his daring escapes and illusions, from his humble beginnings of minor tricks in local places and parlors... to performances in theaters and opera houses for prestigious guests. Once he became famous, he took took to another attention seeking venture that many never knew about, and got him into some trouble. A must see!",1410220800,,618,5.0
