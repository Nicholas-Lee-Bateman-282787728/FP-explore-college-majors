8698124,4,B00SCGHMDM,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, Combat Zone Wrestling, and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

P.W.G. Champion Kyle O'Reilly's scheduled title defense was against the B.O.L.A. '14 champion Ricochet cashing in his title match in a match with both men having different styles as Kyle was more mat based submission wrestling while Ricochet was more athletic with some high flying in a competitive match that also saw both men playing mind games with each other from getting ""sleazy"" to delivering some ""electrifying"" moves ""outta nowhere.""  The biggest story of the night happened after that match when Roderick Strong attacked Kyle leading to them competing in a ""Guerrilla Warfare"" match for the P.W.G. Championship that saw both men use weapons such as a trash can & both men going through a table together at one point while completely destroying a heavy amount of chairs by either forcefully putting their opponents head or body through it along with choking each other with anything they could get their hands on including a chain & taking apart the ring ropes as this was a physical fight that kept going on until one man's body just couldn't take it anymore.  Chris Sabin & Matt Sydal faced off against Young Bucks was an evenly matched contest as both team had similar strategy against each other not only on the mat but in the air while Sabin & Sydal had natural chemistry for what I think was their first time teaming together with each team having unique double teaming tactics.  Other matches include P.W.G. Tag Team Champions World's Cutiest Tag Team (Joey Ryan & Candice LaRae) defended their belts against The Addiction (Frankie Kazarian & Christopher Daniels) in a match that went back & forth that had it's comedic moments such as how a blowpop ended up being the one foreign object that everyone was more scared of as the match went on, a fatal four way between Biff Busick vs. Brian Cage vs. Tomasso Ciampa vs. Uhaa Nation in a non-stop action match with one move after another that not only saw a 619 to three men at once (with neither guy being the size of Rey Mysterio) but also enough suplexes between all four during the match that would make Brock Lesnar lose count, Chris Hero vs. Trevor Lee who was an underdog here fighting from behind as Hero attacked before the bell & didn't let up throughout the match including a counter to the frog splash that I've never seen before, Adam Cole had a shoulder injury he suffered a week earlier but put off surgery to face ACH...I mean Cedric Alexander (watch the match to get the joke), and ACH & A.R. Fox & Rich Swann vs. Bobby Fish & Johnny Gargano & Chuck Taylor that was full of Christmas spirit from ""Ho Ho ACH"" to Chuck Taylor being ""Mr. Grinch"" with some comedic moments including how a regular wastelock turned into a very ackward worm.

Nine times out of ten, you can't go wrong with a P.W.G. show & this was no different as it was a very solid & entertaining show but I was only a small step below their usual performances but definately a better improvement than their previous ""Untitled II"" show with the story of the night being Kyle O'Reilly wrestling two different matches against two competitors back to back with two completely different styles for close to an hour so I recommend checking this out.",1424044800,,3549,4.764227642276423

If you're tired of watching WWE every monday night then you need to invest in PWG Dvd's and go to their shows if you live in california. I live in new york so the only thing I can do is invest in their Dvd's

8698126,5,B00SCGHMDM,Every match was great. The show really didn't have a weak moment. The fact it's only 2 1/2 hours is slightly disappointing but it's not a deal breaker. Black cole sun is a must buy dvd for wrestling fans.,1423180800,,204,4.256410256410256
