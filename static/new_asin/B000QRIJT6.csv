8197149,4,B000QRIJT6,"ABCs Primetime conducts a hidden camera examination of what people do when confronted with various ethical dilemmas prompting them to act or ignore in the series, What Would You Do?

Using realistic scenarios involving actors portraying victims and villains, the series tests ordinary people to gain an understanding on what unexpected bystanders would do--without knowing that they are being observed--in all sorts of circumstances.
Producers take the experiment even further by addressing and analyzing what perceptual influences dictate these peoples behaviorwhether the behavior is of an active or passive nature.

Its hard to know for certain what you would do in a situation similar to those presented during What Would You Do? But watching this primetime television show helps you grasp the reality behind the Good Samaritan mentality while shedding light on factors that prevent or provoke combat.

We all would like to think that we would contribute to the mission of restoring faith in modern-day humanity, but we need to take a step back and consider the brutal reality of what would we ignore or look past if we believed no one was watching.
What Would You Do? also looks at how both race and gender come into play during the series scripted settings. It sparks numerous questions during each episode, which contain an average of two or three ethical predicaments.
For example, if rambunctious teenagers were taunting an elderly person at a bus stop, would more bystanders respond if the victim was female or male?

Furthermore, what implications would there be if the adolescent pranksters were of a minority race?
Do some scenarios resonate more with female onlookers as opposed to males or vice versa? And if so, why?
If someone fails to act, what is keeping them from acting?

All of these considerations are addressed and illustrated by the television show to provoke thought and discussion among the audience at home. Quite honestly, this dialog rarely surfaces otherwise.
What Would You Do? is the first series of its kind. While other television series, such as MTVs Boiling Points, utilize humor to send people over the edge, this ABC series takes a more serious approach that is aimed at prompting change and understanding human nature.

No one can predict their reaction to something without being in the moment themselves. Host John Quinones tells us just that. Its easy to hold high expectations of ourselves and judge the people on the series who don't react in the way we deem necessary.
American society has been continuously moving to a place in which we value independence and passiveness, a sort of every man for himself mentality. And while the lack of collectivity in our society has benefitted us in certain ways, What Would You Do? brings up the question of how different our society would be if it promoted charity or compassion instead.

This shows placement during the primetime programming hours lays the foundation for beneficial dinner table discussions between family members of all ages.

We are programmed to make split decisions in these moments of truth, decisions we often cannot predict until we experience them for ourselves. That being said, we are constantly jumping to conclusions and placing ourselves in these events depicted on TV.
On one hand, its natural to identify ourselves with others to gain a better understanding, but we need to stop jumping to judgment and accept the truth about our often selfish tendencies.

What Would You Do? serves as an example of our society as a whole. It enlightens, educates, triggers thought and discussion, and aims towards change in our society.",1391817600,,3640,5.093959731543624
