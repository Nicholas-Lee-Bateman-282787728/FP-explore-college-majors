8514514,3,B007CHY54Q,"A peculiar DVD.

The background music is good.

This is the first I have ever heard what might be the full voice recordings with a transcript of the Gagarin flight, though basically he never says much. 'He's in good condition, can they (the ground) hear him? He can hear them; sometimes he cannot hear them. Hes looking out the window, its a great view, hes looking out the window again, its still a great view; or there are clouds, or the sky is black... he's in good condition, can they (the ground) hear him? He can hear them; sometimes he cannot hear them. Hes looking out the window, its a great view, or there are clouds, or the sky is black...' Repetitive.

The images and video I expected much more. There are lots of good pictures available of Gagarin prior to the flight in training and getting into the vehicle but almost none of the pictures are in this product. There is TV of Gagarin in flight, but nothing in this video. Even if they'd simply wanted to simulate the flight by getting images and video of the specific areas he flew over, there is plenty of that available; it is hard to know whether the scenes coincide with the actual terrain or the correct time of day during which he was flying . More information, especially if the scenery were coordinated,.might make it a bit more informative.. A few things are coordinated...he says he sees clouds, and some clouds call into view. The better video or still images (it is frequently hard to tell whether it is still imagery or not) are relatively recent from the ISS. But in general there is not a lot of scenery going by the window. They could have made some better selections to make the film a bit more interesting. Some of the scenes are a peculiar choice since they clearly show the International Space Station Cupola-the cupola has a center window with six surrounding windows. Vostok had only one or two small circular portholes; and the ISS solar panels-Vostok 1 had no solar panels. Apparently a lot of the video was taken by astronauts on the ISS. The end appears to be some kind of a reentry.

There is little about the landing except for some subtitles.

Somewhat interesting that the credits identify that little came from Russia.

IF the voice recordings are complete then it might be worthwhile for the space collector but note that the voice only seems to be on the first half of the flight and on the whole it seems pretty repetitive.",1384819200,,2421,4.554022988505747
8514515,3,B007CHY54Q,I expected more out of this DVD but it is a decent work recreating the first orbit of Yuri Gagarin. The audio is not bad either given the age and the scenes are very nice. It is pretty basic. Communications between Dawn 1 and Cedar 1 and background music while Yuri orbtis the earth. It is in real time. The beginning is way more interesting than the end. There are more communications Yuri and ground control. Towards the end there are almost none at all. He does loose radio contact as he orbits the earth but I was expecting there would be some kind of communication before reentry and there was none. People who are into space and history might enjoy this DVD but I woulnd't recommend it to everybody.,1353974400,,705,4.430769230769231
