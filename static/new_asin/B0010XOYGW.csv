8239273,5,B0010XOYGW,"A Girl Like Me (The Gwen Araujo Story) is acted with great sensitivity by a brilliant cast. The idea that this heart breaking drama is based on a true story is almost too much to bear. In a world that could create such beauty as this film, the hideous hatred that brought Gwen to her death coexists.

Gwen Araujo, rest in peace. Let those who took your life continue to wallow in their hatred. In the end, it will be beauty that kills the beast.",1283040000,3,445,4.235294117647059

Ignorance isn't a virtue. At least Gwen has her mom on her side, all thru her transition. I didn't, got disowned due to religious situation. But at 34yo now, i am trying to use my shows as a vehicle to educate the world about Transexualism. This dvd is explains Just because I wasn't fortunate enough to be born as a female externally, instead had to set off an atomic bomb in my life to become a woman, should not mean that i am forever doomed to a life of ridicule and marginalisation. I greatly value honesty and integrity and find those who lack those qualities distasteful. I live in hope that I will find someone with the emotional maturity, robustness of ego, and moral fibre to find happiness with me.

The fact that I am transexual woman is not an indication of a deep level of kink, or a lack of moral fibre. Becoming who I am was a life or death response to a lifelong disconnect between external presentation and internal identity. My journey has required enormous sacrifice, pain and in-depth self discovery. If you have an issue with this - please keep your opinions to yourself. Unless you have lived my life, there is no way you could comprehend. And just because some of you out there that know a few transexuals, don't mean u know what we go thru day by day of our lives, struggling and trying so hard to live our lives the way we feel right, and the way we see fit, with how we feel deep down internally within ourselves...
Gwen, may u rest in peace, babe. Thank u for sharing ur story.",1207440000,8,1661,4.358064516129033
