5053671,5,B007458EDE,"The facts are well known among the political minded folk in America. The people who talk politics at the coffee shop and around the dinner table every day. The thing that amazes me is Fixing America clearly demonstrates that people of every stripe, color, creed and economic status are fully aware of the huge problems facing our great republic (One nation, under God with liberty and justice for all) and by all making an effort of any kind we actually can fix America. Here's what I learned:

I have to work for locally: 1. To advocate for my Local, State and Federal governments to Balance their Budgets (I have to, they should too), 2. the USA must become energy independent, 3. The USA must balance the trade deficit with Communist China (by raising the tariff on imports from Communist China, pressuring Communist China to stop rigging its currency by global political pressure, and always buying American made goods whenever possible). If we wage the war at the local level, one by one, then our cumulative voices will be heard.

It may be a good idea to see the film if you haven't already.",1330905600,4,1098,4.683937823834197
5053672,5,B007458EDE,"Our national debt and trade deficit are complex problems. Fixing America is masterful in its explanation. The movie makes numbers come alive and issues more comprehensible. After watching this movie, for example, you will understand how devastating the impact of $14+ trillion in national debt. And you will understand, even if math is not your thing.

I particularly like the way this film juxtaposes the views of ordinary Americans with those of politicians and economists. There are no Republican or Democratic agendas. There's just a no-nonsense story about the problems we face as a nation, and in this era of Washington gridlock, the movie stays true to its name by avoiding partisan politics. It's all about Fixing America.

Before you vote this year, take an hour or so to watch Fixing America. You'll be glad you did.",1330819200,4,826,5.021897810218978
5053673,5,B007458EDE,"I saw this film last night and found it to be very well done. Showing what real life is while not taking sides, this is not new information but a renewal of what is known but overlooked. The timing of it's release is a big piece due to the upcoming elections, just a reminder of what we ALL are faced with. I found this film to stimulate me, not to depress me, and a tool to keep the awareness going of the changes needed and how we do make a difference by participating in making these changes. Believe.",1330819200,3,504,4.153061224489796
5053674,5,B007458EDE,"My wife and I went to see the movie on the first night of its release.  The movie is well done.  It paints a sad but very real picture of  the current state of our once great nation.  I hope this movie is watched my many and that many decide to take action.  My fear is that our nation's best days have already past us.

Everyone who loves this country needs to watch this movie and take act no matter how small.",1330732800,3,412,3.9634146341463414
5053675,5,B007458EDE,"This movie is about America - in the words of everyday Americans from across the country. It is interesting and thought provoking. We Americans, no matter what part of the country we are from, have great ideas that should be implemented by the politicians. I thought it was great!!! Everyone should see this movie!!",1330646400,4,315,4.851851851851852
5053676,5,B007458EDE,"This movie is a must see.  If you love your community and your country,  the stories and the information portrayed will give you food for thought and move you.",1330646400,7,159,4.448275862068965
5053677,5,B007458EDE,"If you love this great country you need to watch this shocking documentary.  You will appreciate the quality and down home feel.  Real Americans need to follow a budget and they know the consequences if they don't.  Why don't our politicians know and why don't they do something about balancing the budget and the China trade deficit?

This documentary is great because it takes you through the back roads of the country and you learn first hand from average Americans what needs to be done.  Now if only the ""Political Elite"" would listen.

Pros: Quality, price

Cons: None",1330646400,8,574,4.795918367346939
8509622,4,B007458EDE,Well done. Good cross section of America. Our country is under attack by socialist liberals. More need to stand our ground! And return to the original intent of our Founders!,1374796800,,174,4.833333333333333
8509623,5,B007458EDE,"I watched this movie on instant video, and loved it so much that I bought a copy.  This film is relevant to everyone in our country, regardless of age, race, gender, or circumstance.  I enjoyed seeing people from across the nation expressing similar sentiments.  Steve Laffey asks tough questions and truly listens to the answers these men and women give.  The film is a wake up call that we all must act quickly to ensure a prosperous future for our children.",1342224000,,460,4.6419753086419755
8509624,5,B007458EDE,"Like when he was Mayor of Cranston, Steve Laffey sees problems and attempts to fix them.  America needs serious and fundamental reform.",1335312000,,135,5.136363636363637
8509625,5,B007458EDE,"From Texas to Connecticut, Steve Laffey and Doctor Skoly get to the heart of the problems that are facing America's future.  Steve Laffey speaks with American's who speak candidly about their problems, their children's problems and their neighbor's problems.
Government officials receiving high salaries and benefits while unemployment is at an all time high, government debt in the trillions, jobs moving overseas due to favorable import/export policies making American companies really foreign Companies and energy prices shooting through the roof.  While sad, it's great to see that Steve Laffey and Doctor Skoly have let the voice of American's who are burdened with everyday struggles be heard.
There is no agenda here, not Republican or Democrat.  Steve Laffey and Doctor Skoly show you where the country is and where the country is dangerously headed if the government continues to enrich itself and American's do not become active in ""Fixing America.""

I highly recommend this film and support the cause.",1333929600,2,1012,5.386075949367089
8509626,5,B007458EDE,"Fixing America is a wonderful but depressing work. Laffey interviewed dozens of ordinary Americans, and their voices are dripping with disappointment and fear. They know what's going on, but the politicians in Washington driving us toward the cliff either don't get it or don't care.

But Fixing America isn't lacking hope. The ordinary folks he talks to have solutions. Real solutions. It's just getting the message to Washington that is the problem.",1333584000,2,451,5.263888888888889
8509627,5,B007458EDE,"Fixing America masterfully melds beautiful cinematography, a haunting yet catchy score, a substantive and timely message, myriad nuggets of interesting facts, and a common touch into an absorbing and important film.

Writer and producer Steve Laffey's background as a Harvard MBA, top-level business executive, two-term politican, author, and TV personality makes him ideally suited to develop a film in this genre and of this caliber. Laffey has a deft interviewing touch and is able to quickly bond with interviewees - who are the real stars of the movie.

Each interviewee is riveting in his/her own way. The film intersperses blue collar workers, students, professionals, TV and radio personalities, politicians, and academics with nice graphics and historical film clips. Laffey himself is featured at times in a low-key, humorous, and interesting manner - yet this isn't some type of Michael Moore-type production where the ego of the filmmaker dwarfs everything else.

I just loved the insertion and positioning of portions of Jimmy Carter's malaise speech. It was not only hilariously done but also served to amplify a point about energy dependence reiterated throughout the film.

Other points well made in the film include but are not limited to: Our country has all the fuel it needs in natural gas which, if fully utilized, would eliminate our need for foreign sources; the true cost of fuel today is over $15/gallon if the costs of defending the middle east are included; China will do most anything to keep its largely male and potentially restive population employed; if entitlements are properly included, our debt situation is far worse than Greece's right now; neither political party has a real debt reduction plan - it is just a question of which plan increases the debt less rapidly. The so-called ""reductions"" are just a rhetorical sleight-of-hand.

Throughout the movie, the interviewees offer common sense solutions to our nation's problems. The piece-de-resistance, however, comes in a hilarious and hard-hitting bonus feature showing Laffey and John Dodenhoff fixing the deficit in ten minutes.

I highly recommend this inaugural effort by Mr. Laffey. I hope to see many more features from this talented and passionate new filmmaker. I also implore viewers to not miss the bonus feature.",1331942400,,2313,5.2888283378746594
8509628,5,B007458EDE,"The solution to our present national crisis is intuitively clear to regular Americans, and Laffey connects with all sorts of people as he travels across our land.  Their commentaries are interspersed with straight-forward explanations by a variety of experts, who sneak in lessons on basic economics (once known as ""common sense"") as the viewer is nodding in agreement.  Are we desperate enough to implement these measures?  We shall see.  But it is encouraging to recognize that, indeed, I am not alone!  Lots of people get it.  The politicians and the media clearly do not.  They keep us busy debating secondary issues even as the fuse burns short.",1331596800,2,650,5.018691588785047
8509629,5,B007458EDE,"Absolutely a must see movie! This documentary puts aside the Republican/Democrat/Independent political jargon that divides our country more that it unifies us, and focuses on solving the problem here at home with sound logic and reasoning. It is a well structured movie that very simply shows the realistic America that we're living in today, the America where virtue has lost it's dignity. Finally a documentary on fixing America, not because its economically advantageous or politically appropriate, but because it is the right thing to do. I HIGHLY recommend this movie, it is literally something everyone should see!",1331337600,2,620,5.402061855670103
8509630,5,B007458EDE,"Five stars just doesn't do this masterfully produced documentary justice.  It is a masterpiece in cinematography and original score painting the true story of present day America - still a beautiful country, but with some sad signs of decay.  The main characters in this movie are ordinary Americans from various parts of the country and from all walks of life.  Yet their message resonates within all of us:  We love our country. We know why things are the way they are. And when we take a moment from our busy lives to think about it; we know what needs to be done.  Why then do our elected officials do little to nothing about the enormous debt?  Why are foreign governments who hate us allowed to control our energy policy?  Why has our once thriving manufacturing base been lost to a communist dictatorship half way across the world?

If you love this country and have a pulse, you won't be able to sit still after seeing Fixing America.  I bought the DVD and keep watching it again and again with friends and family.  It is the most important story in America.  The timing could not be better.",1331251200,2,1099,4.5561224489795915
8509631,5,B007458EDE,"Steve Laffey is best known in Rhode Island for his no-nonsense approach to fixing America.  This time he's traveled the country talking to regular people, asking them what can be done.  It's astonishing that these real people are out there, in every state, and yet our politicians can't seem to get anything done about it.  Our elected officials are supposed to support our best interests, but they seem to support their own.  It's up to Americans to let them know that they need to get off their high horses and get some work done.  Raising money for your next campaign should be less important than the hungry or unemployed people of the state you represent.",1330905600,3,660,4.7043478260869565
