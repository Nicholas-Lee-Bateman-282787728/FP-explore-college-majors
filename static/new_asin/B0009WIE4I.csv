2327236,5,B0009WIE4I,"My husband and I have 7 month old triplets.  We found Classical Baby on HBO, and began watching it with the kids as part of our wind down before bed time.  It is incredibly calming for all of us.  The kids love it.  The music and animation are done so well.  We initially steered away from DVD's, but this one is worth buying and showing to your kids.",1164153600,16,351,4.102941176470588
2327237,5,B0009WIE4I,"We started watching this series when my son was about 26 months old.  He's now 30 months (2.5 years), and he is still spell-bound everytime we play it.  He's also a VERY high-energy toddler and we use it just before bed, and it really helps quiet him and get him ready for sleep.  The music and visuals are beautiful, and he has fun naming the different animals, shapes, objects in each video clip.  We have all 3 (Music, Dance, Art), plus the remixes that HBO did of all 3.  Highly recommended!",1140480000,19,495,4.395604395604396
2327238,5,B0009WIE4I,"We LOVE this series.  We could watch it over and over even if we didn't have a baby.  By the way, she really loves Classical Baby.  Our pediatrician suggested that we not let our child watch TV before a certain age, which we don't watch anyway, with the exception of videos such as these.  The art and music are beautiful.  The motions aren't frenetic and are just slow enough for babies to just zone out on and enjoy.  These are our new favorite gifts to buy our expecting friends.",1139097600,9,482,4.359550561797753

2327268,5,B0009WIE4I,"My children loved all of the Baby Classical.  They would sit in front of the TV from infants & be glued to it.  It is also pleasant to listen to while you try to get somethings done while they are preoccupied.  Much better than listening to Dora or Barney.  I would rather get Classical Baby stuck in my head for the day than one of those.  They are now 5 & & YO and if I turn it on, they still sit & watch it.",1412380800,,410,3.776470588235294

2327292,5,B0009WIE4I,"Our kids started watching/listening to the Classical Baby series a few months after they were born. While some of the tracks on each DVD didn't thrill them, most of the selections kept them captivated.  The Dance DVD was their favorite, especially Mambo and Farm Dance.  It's important to introduce classical and jazz music to kids at a very early age (we got it through the classic cartoons when we were kids!) because both classical and jazz have lots of tonal textures and key changes and don't rely as heavily as pop/rock/hiphop/r&b on simple, repetitive ""hooks.""  Adding Classical Baby DVDs to your child's visual and audio repertoire can help stimulate creativity and enhance memory.  One listen won't make our kids geniuses, but introducing classical and jazz at a very early age plants the seeds for music appreciation to grow within our children.",1407628800,,855,5.042553191489362

2327295,5,B0009WIE4I,"My son has adored all three, music/dance and art. We try not to watch too much of anything with him, but the truth is, he hasn't really been interested in anything else on the TV, while these hold him spellbound (which is nice when he needs to wind down before a nap or I have to make dinner). We never watch more than one of these a day and put them on a rotation.

It is true that there are certain segments that lose him (like the Ugly Duckling segment on the dance video), and some segments he had to grow to like, but on the whole, this is a total hit.

For us, as adults, its wonderful that we can enjoy this music as well, and many of the animated sequences are top-notch, while a few are brilliant.",1405382400,2,706,4.071942446043166

They are appealing videos as well as having ""real"" classical music played by instruments, not music boxes !

We've particularly liked Baby Art, Baby Music, and Baby Dance ! Thank you, Amy Schatz !",1380672000,,486,4.7976190476190474

2327358,5,B0009WIE4I,"I had boy/girl twins in January of 2012.  When the babies were as young as 3 months old, we began searching for videos that our babies would enjoy and ran across this series on HBO. Somewhat similar to the concept of Baby Einstein or Baby Mozart, these captured our babies' attention far longer and they still watch these nightly at 18 months old.  Once the opening intro song starts, both babies would stop whatever they were doing and cuddle up with us to watch their favorite little baby conductor! Worried that we might accidentally erase these from our DVR cable box, I got online and ordered them right away.  This is one of my TOP FIVE favorite things that I have purchased for the babies.  Each time we turn it on to calm a crying child or prepare for bed, we are amazed and how much they still love, enjoy and are still very interested in this video after seeing it at least 200 times.....not exaggerating...probably closer to 300 times!

I have to say that my babies absolutely love this video along with the Classical Baby Music and Classical Baby Art videos.  The music in all three videos is, well, classical and the videos that play along are both colorful and entertaining. I can't imagine what our life would be like had we not found these and would highly recommend them to others in hopes that their babies love them as much as mine have and still do!",1374451200,,1369,4.5

All of them sounds too ... monotonous for kids. My daughter really enjoys first few pieces but after that she starts to turn away playing something else because the music  being monotonous and kinda slow that make her pay not as much attention as beginning. It'll be better if the music tone & speed are changed piece after piece that will for sure draw kids into it. I rate it 3.5 stars.",1373068800,2,549,4.121495327102804

There is not a clinker in any of the Classical Baby format DVDS. For my mother, this DVD offers a variety of appeals. The Cute Kids, baby conducting, animals falling asleep at end. It's all adorable to her. A half hour of adorableness. I can put this on any time, and the music alone is pleasant background. The dancing sometimes gets her moving in her chair. An unusual one for the elderly is the fun rendition of the tap dance stars of the past, the Nicholas Brothers.

Really, if you have outgrown these DVDs with your babies, please forward the set up your lineage to some great grandmother who is ailing and perhaps has dementia. Try viewing with her and see if it's something she is drawn to. It is possible that she'll love seeing it dozens of times, forever. Or donate to an Alzheimer's unit or adult day care. Or give to a professional caregiver to take along in her goodie bag when she works with clients. This one could be in a pediatric Physical therapy unit, or a geriatric PT unit.

HBO, please do more of these. Nature themes alone could make up four (earth,wind,fire,water) or Animals, Plants. There could be country themes, or DECADE themes. With a little tweaking, they could be directed a bit more toward Alzheimer's use. Remember, we baby boomers are going to be babies again. Have a Woodstock Classical Baby.

Regardless of any new formatting, these are already fine for  my mother. Sure others would get value from these as well.",1275523200,18,1763,4.601910828025478

But the Classical Baby series--especially the dance dvd--is something special.  Artistic, beautiful, and a nice blend of different types of music for a healthy exposure.  Who ever knew I would hear someone who just learned to talk to ask for ""Baby Mambo!"".  Really, a guilt-free must for any parent of a toddler.",1216684800,,429,4.756756756756757

I love them easily as much as she does but watching her joy and glee is just the best.  The Original and the Dance Dvds are her favorites.  Not so much on the poetry one yet.  Highly Recommend!,1211673600,,325,4.423728813559322
2327442,5,B0009WIE4I,"My son asked for these when we borrowed them from the library so many times we just bought them :) They are really interesting - the songs/dances are just long enough to hold a young child's attention (he's been watching them since he was about 18 months and is now 3) but interesting enough (not pretentious or *eagerly educational*) to watch repeatedly. I also like how they use real instruments and real recordings rather than music box sounds. I ALSO appreciate that they added some jazz and a little ""mambo"" in there, since classical is not the only valid musical style in the world :) Definitely worth a buy or at least borrowing from the library, if you can do so :)",1210464000,,673,4.524590163934426

I thought it would have a bit more realistic dancing in it, but it mainly shows drawn cartoon figures moving around.  My kids both love music and dancing, but this didn't hold their attention.  I personally think the Playschool Prep series is better for capturing interest.",1199836800,9,376,4.567164179104478

It's short enough that I don't feel bad that they are watching instead of playing a musical instrument. That said, this show has heightened their awareness and appreciation for music. My 5-year-old is playing the violin and doing classical ballet. My 2-year-old is expressing interest in playing the cello.
