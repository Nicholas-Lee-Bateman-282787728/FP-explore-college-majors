8658932,4,B00KHBAKN4,"this is the true story of a black English officer from the first world war.  This was actually a tv special and not a movie. It is mainly about his training and then he goes to war very briefly.  IT's well made but it's a hour long show from the zeros, not a movie. They make up for this fact with a excellent hour long documentary about the somme.  It really explains haw the battle was and how it changed warfare.  In fact most of us have only heard about the first battle of the somme. One of the worst lead battles in history., but they fought later battles there and change tactics and the second major battle was a huge success.  Both of the episodes here look great and the acting is very good in both of them The second show has many battle scenes in it and this is the main reason to watch this dvd. It is important to horror  Walter  though , as he was a first and a great leader of men in many battles.",1423699200,,913,4.038888888888889

8658934,3,B00KHBAKN4,not much action here. its only 53 minutes long so primarily it covers his training in officers candidate school. if the movie was longer they could have added a lot more action making it a great movie. keeping the romance it would appeal to men and women alike. but as is. its not worth the money.,1416096000,,297,4.321428571428571
8658935,5,B00KHBAKN4,"This 53-minute drama, based on the life of Walter Tull - the first negro to become an officer in the British Army during World War I (after being the first Negro in professional English football) was produced - and aired - in 2008. It is being released in the US for the first time. Though I thought it short at that length, I later decided that it did work in that time frame as the purpose was to show Tull's war years. I'm sure there is another film to be made about his football years but that was not the purpose here.

Tull is probably well known in the UK - where he was the Jackie Robinson of football- breaking the color line. But, here in the US he is an unknown and I - for one - am glad that I now know something about him. The acting is excellent all around and it needs to be remembered that this is a fictional portrayal of the events, based on some known facts. There is even time for a ""love interest"". There are reenacted scenes of battle and they are graphic - some as graphic as ""Saving Private Ryan"" - so this is not a film for young people to watch without adult supervision.

BBC Home video has supplemented the DVD package with a 2006 documentary (58-minutes) on The Somme War - (Britain's biggest defeat in WWI). It uses mostly recreations to tell the story. The connection with the ""Walter's War"" film is that this is the war that Tull served in as an officer.

As an American - who knew little about this story, I am glad I had a chance to see this film and that BBC Home Video released it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8658936,3,B00KHBAKN4,"***INCLUDES ANOTHER EXCELLENT PRODUCTION CALLED SOMME: FROM DEFEAT TO VICTORY***  BUY IT FOR THE EXTRA PROGRAM IF YOU GET A GOOD PRICE

Partially fictionalized story of Walter Tull who was born of mixed heritage to a father from Barbados and mother from Britain.  His grandmother was a slave in Barbados.  He was a professional footballer for Tottenham Hotspurs and Northampton Town.  His heroism prompted his superiors to recommend him for commission despite a law specifically prohibiting people of mixed-heritage from exercising command.  He ultimately became the first fully recognized mixed-heritage (classified black) British Army officer.  He fought in both Italy and France, including the Battle of the Somme.  He was also only the second mixed-heritage footballer to play in the top division in Britain.  With only one hour run time and a so-so script, this drama deals very shallowly (or skips altogether) much of what is interesting in Walter's life such as his football career and combat service before Officer's Candidate School (OCS).  Most of these prior events are dealt with in very brief flashbacks and almost no explanation of context in those scenes.  The movie does illustrate in the short run time that Walter went to Officer's Candidate School, endured bigotry, and ultimately triumphed.  My argument is that simply covering a point is not the same thing as selling it.  It's ok that this isn't his whole story.  But even if you suppose it's just about his experience in OCS, we don't see enough of why they were willing to send the first black man to OCS.  We don't get enough scope of the bigotry he faced to impress us that he succeeded.  They essentially throw around a few N words and skew a physical competition so he can't win.  Yes, that's very offensive, but do we believe this is the worst of what he experienced?  Are we supposed to feel he should have quit because of a few nasty name calling episodes?  The movie just doesn't have emotional punch despite the subject matter.

This production is only inspired by the life of Walter Tull and is highly fictionalized (an opening credit headline stating this was removed from the U.S. DVD release, though correct).  Significant characters and scenes in the movie are strictly creations which waste time in an already short program.  It's odd that they spend time on a love relationship at OCS which truly would have been dramatic, if it existed (yet no one seems to mind in the movie) while the actual drama of the bigotry he faced was somewhat blandly covered compared to real life.  It would have been much more interesting if they had humanized Walter by showing a little more of his life and triumphs as a footballer and his reasons for joining the military.  That would have invested the viewer much more in the story.  I also really would like to have seen more of his action in WWI that prompted them to send him to officer's school.  The story just feels like it skips through everything that should make us care.  One of the glaring extras missing from this DVD is the BBC documentary about Walter Tull that fills in all the holes left by the dramatization.  The narration is only ok, but the content really helps us understand Walter's story.

***SOMME: FROM DEFEAT TO VICTORY:  this set also includes the 5 star program of the title I just mentioned and runs just under an hour.  It is partially dramatized and interspersed with narration and terrific footage.  The inclusion of the second program would definitely make this disc worth it for the right price.",1414108800,9,3552,4.839137645107795
