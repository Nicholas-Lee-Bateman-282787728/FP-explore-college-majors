8092326,1,B000BTGXYC,"I just received this DVD (Friday, Feb. 9, 2007).  It turns out that it was produced by a company called St. Clair, which is famous for re-recording hit songs many years after the songs were on the charts and releasing them on compact disc.  Usually, 1 or 2 of the original recording artists perform on the re-make sessions.  The sound quality is usually poor and the instrumentation and singing are never as good as the original recording that you heard on the radio way back when.

This St. Clair DVD is typical of that company.  None of these music videos show the recording artists at the ages they were when these songs were on the charts--they are way older.  And the sound quality is just as poor as on St. Clair's CDs.

And, just as you'll often find on St. Clair's CDs, the artists' singing voices have degraded considerably with age--Lynn Anderson's being the most obvious here.",1170979200,4,887,4.611464968152866
