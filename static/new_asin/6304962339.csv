8698268,4,6304962339,"This is an excellent tape for boys that already have some pitching skills and less for someone who is looking for all the mechanics of a windup and pitching grips, etc. (tom emanski's pitching video and roger craig's video are better for those basic skills)

Mazzone's straight forward dialogue is refreshing and his helpful hints about throwing EVERY day, throwing breaking pitches the proper way to protect the pitching arm and other topics are better suited, I believe, for the pitcher who is 13 or 14 years old or older and is working on improving a FEW, SPECIFIC parts of his game rather than the young boy/girl that is looking for all the basics of pitching.  Great footage of Maddox, Avery, Smoltz and Glavine when they all pitched for the Braves",1090627200,,753,4.740458015267175
