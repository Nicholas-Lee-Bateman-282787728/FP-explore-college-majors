So when I found out that he had taken time to make this DVD, I got one for my classroom and another one for the house.  This is not one of those ego trip videos where the artist (or an incredible simulation) rips through ten or twenty licks at full speed, then looks into the camera with that ""Go ahead, I dare ya!""  sneer.  Cary Park pulls it in, slows it down, shows you the frets and the fingers, and takes you step by step - bar by bar.  His sense of humor shows through, but never overwhelms.  A classic example of getting those who can to get you through, this DVD is essential for any serious player's sound library.",1332374400,,785,4.1655629139072845
