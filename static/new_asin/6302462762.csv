466273,5,6302462762,"I have been give or take on Chevy for a long time, like him on SNL, In Caddyshack, then with the Fletch movies and Vacation movies, he sort of lost me. He got me all the way back , with MOAIM, this movie is amazing. I get that he is invisible the where time after the Accident, and had no trouble with that leap, even when we could see him, Chevy is a visual comedian, not seeing him would have lessened his impact on the movie. And he is ably supported by an amazing group of actors as well. I was laughing with him and others at appropriate times, was swept away by his Love interest in Darryl Hannah, was feeling the total Menace of Sam Neil's bad guy Agent, the story pushed all the buttons in my head it was aiming for.

466333,4,6302462762,"I advise you, if you're the readin' type, to go unearth H.F. Saint's novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-an-Invisible-Man/dp/0689117353/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of an Invisible Man</a>, the source material for this movie. It's a better read than this movie is a better watch. Having said that, John Carpenter's adaptation is a pretty dang watchable thriller with a neat sci-fi hook. Carpenter directs it, and that alone is a tremendous selling point. It's got Daryl Hannah in the height of her babeness. Not only is she gorgeous but she plays a strong character that's fleshed out more than the typical love interest. Was Chevy Chase the best actor for this role? No. But if you'd ever wondered whether Chevy can pull off a dramatic role, well, this is as close as he gets.

It's a modern interpretation of H.G. Wells' classic horror tale. This one hews closer to Chevy's tendencies. As such, he plays Nick Halloway, an indifferent San Francisco stock analyst who's a bit of a wiseacre and whose bad timing places him in a research facility in Santa Mira, there to attend a lecture. Courtesy of a magnificent hang-over and seeking some shut-eye, he sneaks away to some out-of-the-way corner. But there's the calamitous coffee spill in the control room triggering a ""random, freakish event"" that renders bits of the building invisible. And Nick wholly invisible. Strange things tend to happen in Santa Mira. Look it up.

This retelling is more chase thriller than horror, and I think it suffers some from it in how it resonates with you. The film could've done with more of the poignancy and sense of tragedy that would've been more palpable were it on a horror platform. Oh, sure, the story explores Nick's sense of isolation and the psychological trauma of being invisible, of the absolute absence of acknowledgment from everyone, of being seen. I imagine, after some time, one begins to question one's own reality. See, there should've been more of that in the movie.

The special effects - optical married with digital - are wicked good for its time (1992). I enjoyed the, er, sight gags. We're made privy to some marvelous visuals - the cigarette smoke filling up Nick's lungs or that somewhat icky shot of Nick's food being digested. One thing that may have messed the movie up some is that, in certain scenes, we, the movie audience, can see Nick even though, to the people in the movie, he remains invisible. Maybe it was in Chase's contract that his mug must be onscreen for a certain percentage of the time. But in the 1933 version, Claude Rains kept unseen for most of the movie, and that was eerie and truly effective and drove in the thematic point.

I like this movie, stumbles and all. The Hitchcock element introduces itself pretty much right away, mostly because Nick couldn't keep his head down and his trap shut, and, so, cue the flabbergasted witnesses. But, now, here's the rogue CIA operative (Sam Neill) come sniffing around. Neill is a sinister, relentless presence, his every move, his every word shouting to the world how shady he is. Throughout, he and Chase engage in a series of tense cat-and-mouse face-offs with Chase's character each time evading capture only by the skin of his teeth. Chevy, while no Harrison Ford from The Fugitive, makes a surprisingly credible action hero.

I know this movie isn't held in high esteem by plenty of people. Reportedly, Carpenter loathed this movie. And it's certainly nowhere near Carpenter's best pictures. But Memoirs... is probably my third-favorite Chevy Chase movie, after Foul Play and Oh Heavenly Dog. Yes, over Vacation and Fletch and Spies Like Us - don't get mad. Maybe it's because of the quirk in seeing a more restrained Chevy. I think he's quite good, although, being Chevy, he couldn't resist throwing in the occasional deadpan one-liner, never mind that he's supposed to be freaking out, what with being in an alarming state of molecular flux and all. And call me a sucka but the thing that tied it all together for me was the love story. It got me invested right away, and, yes, it was poignant... and mature. Chevy is muy sympatico with his leading lady. As mentioned above, Daryl Hannah is able to, for the most part, sidestep the damsel-in-distress pitfalls. Alice Monroe (Hannah), who produces documentaries for the Smithsonian, has considerable personality. She knows her own mind. And, in banter with Nick, she gives as good as she gets.

- Alice: ""Boy, how am I gonna tell my mom about this?""
- Nick: ""All the dirty parts I'd leave out. Just tell her you met a guy, like him a lot, could be serious, he's transparent.""
- Alice: ""Are you Catholic?""
- Nick: ""No.""
- Alice: ""That could be a problem.""

466548,3,6302462762,"I read H.F. Saint's book Memoirs of an Invisible Man and so I welcome the opportunity to check out the movie version. I thought that both Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah did a really good job acting in the movie.  As a quasi  Chevy Chase fan, had  I not read the book I thought the role could have been written just for him. The idea of a man becoming invisible and having to get through everyday life while being on the run since of course now he's an anomaly is just too incredible.  And this is so Chevy.

However,  I did read the book, Twice, and sadly, the movie just  doesn't it any justice. Maybe if they added another 15 minutes and perhaps added a little more detail to it it might've been more of a success at the box office. Or maybe not. If you read the book, it doesn't really come across as a comedy. Maybe that's where they went wrong. Maybe if they had someone like Val Kilmer play the role it might have had a different flavour or different taste to it. With Chevy I think we knew what to expect.

Whether it's worth watching is entirely up to you. If you like Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah then you probably enjoy it,  Please don't read the book first. At some point, do read the book!",1395964800,,1199,4.178260869565217

If you do watch it remember that the special effect are from1992 and so are a bit primitive by our current standards.

Chevy Chase is awesome in this role as an invisible man on the run from the feds who want to capture him and experiment on his body. He plays it completely straight and is the opposite of what you usually expect from him. He's paired with Daryl Hannah who I think lacks any charisma at all, but that's just me. Her whistful quality does make it easier to believe she would contemplate a life time with someone she can never lay eyes on.

Director: John Carpenter
Writers: H.F. Saint - book, Robert Collector - screenplay
Stars: Chevy Chase, Daryl Hannah, Sam Neill

You don't have to be a Chevy Chase fan to enjoy this movie.  Personally I think this is one of Chases's and Hannah's best movies.  Chavy is caught up in an experiament malfunction and becomes invisible.  To add to his problems the goverment wants to cover up the accident and they don't want him on the loose.  A nice mix of action and comedy.  Great story, acting, directing, sets, camera work, special effects, and music.  Well worth adding to your library if you like SciFi and/or Comedy.  I just watched it again and enjoyed it about as much as the first time I saw it.  Good rewatchability rating.

Why it hasn't been released on Blu-Ray in the US is anyone's guess. The transfer quality of this film is actually better than I had expected considering that this is not a US Blu-Ray release.

Granted, this is not the best film ever made. Casting Chevy Chase was completely questionable considering it isn't intended to be a comedy. The chemistry between Daryl Hannah and Chevy Chase just didn't really work. And, it has its share of story flaws. But, the invisibility effects are still pretty amazing.

466626,5,6302462762,"Chevy Chase has been an interesting artist to me. I never quite know how to see him. No pun intended.

Very much like Stephen Colbert, it seems to me that the man never fully exits his persona. I've never seen the ""real"" Chevy Chase. I honestly don't think many people have, including his friends. So whenever I screen a performance, I'm never quite sure how far into the role he's gotten, if at all. Sincerely doubt even he knows how much he'll get into the role.

This is one of the few exceptions where he submits completely to the process - fully enveloping the character. And it's a really terrific performance.

Wish he did more of these in his career.

Filmed long before the term ""reboot"" came into existence, I have to say that this is one of the best of the category. Updated, not only to showcase technological advances in SFX (of that time circa 1992) but giving the story a more robust and fuller presentation; characters that are better developed and fleshed out, so to speak.

In the film, Chevy plays Nick Halloway, an smarmy insincere stockbroker whose life is pretty much a shallow game of wine, women and song - nothing serious, nothing solid, nothing substantial. And in a cosmic irony, he's about to face all of those life aspects simultaneously.

Sent on behalf of his investment fund to listen to a scientific company's pitch for more venture capitalization, Nick is completely out it - hung over from the previous night's alcohol-laced cavorting - he's barely awake, much less listening to the pitch. Giving up on the gathering, he quietly slips away hoping to find an office couch to sleep off the booze. Finding a private sauna in the executive suites, he's found his temporary bed.

Completely zonked out, he doesn't hear the building alarm. Nor the screams of people, the mass frantic exodus for the exits, and the freakish light show that completely envelops the building.

By way of an accident that he himself unintentionally triggered, and a Rube Goldbergian series of errors, Nick is caught up in a nuclear-style meltdown. A completely unexpected and unplanned effect - parts of the building seemingly vanish, leaving behind swiss cheese fragments of reality. Unfortunately, Nick is part of the cheese that's no longer ""here"".

What no one knew: The company's other big investor was the Central Intelligence Agency. And the newly born invisible man has potential beyond words. Even cut apart via vivisection, the gains would be substantial. Regrettably for them, a bumbling agent's verbalized insight to that horrific scenario ends all hopes of getting Nick to voluntarily submit to their control. Understandably, he won't become their lab rat for some sick research. Or turned into an assassin as is hoped by the lead agent played to sinister perfection by the always enjoyable Sam Neill.

As dark forces begin to hunt him down, he discovers a new respect for life and all it's small, seemingly insignificant pleasures. By having become intangible, he realizes that he's actually becomes more tangible. Nick is now more real and alive than he ever was, but will he live long enough to enjoy the discovery?

Again, an unusual effort by Chevy. Completely believable in a fully realized movie, making this extraordinarily enjoyable. And one of those rare films that goes by so quickly, you're sad the adventure is over.

Movie Notes:

- The one single aspect that I didn't quite buy in the movie's logic, even though it's one of the funnier scenes, when Nick had such difficulty eating Chinese food. Immediately after my first screening, I ate noodles without seeing either the utensils or the food. It's not that difficult. Hate to make this comparison, but people suffering blindness do it every day. On the other hand, seeing the digestion process was understandably revolting. Once in your stomach, no matter how beautiful or elegant when presented as a dish, the consumed version is basically roiling vomit being processed by the body. Just sayin'.

- Daryl Hannah has never been a quality actress in my opinion. Decent, sometimes bordering on pretty good; this effort was the latter. Not that this couldn't have been done by another performer, but Director John Carpenter obviously tailored the role to fit her personality - not the other way around. It's a good performance, but then, it's not exactly superior craftsmanship either.",1350691200,,4370,4.935967302452316

466631,4,6302462762,"I echo the comments of other reviewers here. This ambitious little 1992 film was sorely overlooked at the box office, as if it really were invisible. And that's too bad, because audiences missed a nicely controlled (minus the trademark flippant sarcasm & pratfalls) performance from Chevy Chase, who's more leading man than clown here as a stock market analyst accidentally rendered invisible via a lab mishap. This deftly-directed John Carpenter tale is really just a new spin on the ""Invisible Man"" franchise. But the story is subtly amusing, the special effects are quite impressive for the time, and of course, it has beauty Darryl Hannah and terrific actor Sam Neill as a gung-ho agent obsessed with capturing Chase for his ""secret"". The story rides on the premise of placing a regular guy in an irregular predicament as suddenly, his invisibility is wanted by all.
It's no ""classic"", to be sure. But it has more credibility than being flung into obscurity, which is what it didn't deserve. A nice change-of-pace flick from Chevy!",1317168000,,1035,5.023255813953488

This is another extravagant film by John Carpenter. Here, we get to see the disadvantages of having invisibility. It may sound fun, but in real life, you'll very well regret it if you really have it. Chevy Chase moves away from the comedic genre, and gives us a pretty believable performance as the man who we can't see. Sam Neill is the antagonist that everyone would just love to hate. Daryl Hannah is Chevy's love interest, though her good looks make up for her mediocre acting abilities. The special effects are very impressive, even if it was made in 1992.

This is one heck of a good film. Even if it's not as great as other films that mix humor with suspense and drama, I still enjoyed it. Fans of Chevy Chase, Sam Neill, and John Carpenter should never stop and think if they should see this or not.

466712,4,6302462762,"There are some interesting lessons to be learned from this film....not that any of us will ever get to practice what we learn this since we'd have to be able to turn invisible!

However, when we think about all the fun we could have being invisible, we don't think of all the problems it would cause us, too. This movie brings some of those to light, so to speak.

I enjoyed Chevy Chase and Daryl Hannah in here and I am not fans of either of them. Chase is funny in this film and does an outstanding job playing the role not just with humor but drama, romance and suspense. You get all of that in this movie. Hannah provides the beautiful face and someone for Chevy to chase.

This is another PG-13 movie that really should have been rated R with the language, for one thing. Overall, it's a film whose title may sound hokey but the story is done well. It''s actually thought-provoking. Being invisible would not be all fun and games.",1237507200,,935,4.362068965517241
466713,1,6302462762,"a very good book.  Much like Bonfire of the Vanities, this was horribly miscast and butchered.  How this ever fell into the hands of John Carpenter and Chevy Chase, I'll never understand.  Someone else mentioned that Harrison Ford would have been better cast as the central character and I think that's pretty much dead on but the screenplay would have to have been trashed and put in the hands of someone who wanted to create something that actually represented the original and also in the hands of a more capable director.  John Carpenter may be good at what he does but he was way out of his depth with this and was probably incapable of controlling Chase. Bottom line, the books very good if not great and the movie is a huge disappointment that really sucks.  On the other hand, if you're a big Chase fan, go for it.",1223683200,,822,4.489932885906041

However, this came out after his heyday, and it was di rigeur (sp?) by that time to bash anything that Chevy did.  I even liked some of his talk show stuff, but that is another matter isn't it!  Say what you want about Chase, he had a fantastic run didn't he?  If you are a fan of comedy, then you must admit that he left his mark.  I can't imagine that anyone watching this couldn't get some entertainment out of it.  If you know it is about an invisible man, then I think you know somewhat what you are getting into, if you don't care about that stuff, then obviously stick to what you like, but this was a good one, and if I were Chevy I'd be very proud to have this in my porfolio of films, cheers.",1203206400,3,880,3.9885714285714284
466715,3,6302462762,"If you have not read the book, you may well find this an adequate, reasonably imaginative, and fairly entertaining film.

Unfortunately, because the excellent book of the same name by H.F. Saint (link:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-an-Invisible-Man/dp/9992831367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of an Invisible Man</a>) which inspired it is so superlatively brilliant, this film suffers by comparison.

Tells the story of an ordinary man (Chevy Chase) who is accidentally turned invisible, but still needs to eat, drink, sleep, open doors to pass through them, etc. Government agents see him as a huge opportunity for both spying and scientific reseach. Our hero realises that if the government gets hold of him his life won't be that of a human being but a lab rat, so he goes on the run. The main plot line of the story tells of his battle to keep out of the hands of the government forces and their sinister ringleader, excellently played by Sam Neill.

He also manages to set up a romance with Daryl Hannah's character.

The basic idea and plot are the same in the film as in the original book. But where Saint's novel was an edgy, sexy and exciting thriller packed with very plausible ideas about how human beings might react to the presence of an invisible person, and what he might have to do to survive, the film is much lighter in tone and the story is played mostly for laughs. Which is does often get, but seeing such a dramatic book filmed as light comedy is a bit of an anticlimax.

Probably one reason that the book worked so much better than the film is that invisibility is a subject more easily described by words than pictures. It was vastly easier for H.F. Saint to write about what was happening to his character than for the film to show that there was an invisible man in the room.

Having said that, one or two images from the film which DID manage this well are quite unforgettable, such as Sam Neill staggering towards a door with his hand up behind his back as if an invisible person were holding it there, and a gun magically suspended beside him with the business end pressed against the side of his head. All credit to Neill for a really good bit of acting there.

Overall I would have to describe this as competent but not brilliant, with some good acting from the three leads. But if you are looking for a story about an invisible man which really is brilliant, read H.F. Saint's book. (Or indeed HG Wells' classic original.)",1197158400,2,2515,4.821345707656612
466716,4,6302462762,"This movie is indeed underrated, and perhaps largely unknown due more to its relatively low budget than to its concept or execution.  Chevy Chase is strangely touching portraying in dramatic tones a character caught in what would at first seem a purely comedic situation.  Nick Holloway's predicament is well-realized and well thought-out, and many of the special effects - though not elaborate - are both humorous and intriguing.  Darrell Hannah is her usual sensuous and beautiful self.  Well worth a watch.",1174521600,6,509,5.246913580246914
466717,3,6302462762,"I can't say that I'm that keen on Chevy Chase, sorry, I just do not find him funny! After putting this off for a while, I got told to watch it, or my budgie would die :( I mean, what's a girl to do? Lose her budgie, or sit through an hour & a half of Chevy Chase?

I thought I was going to be constantly reminded of Hollow Man watching this, as it's one that I hated, just about as much as I dislike Chevy Chase. Hollow Man totally freaked me out, from Kevin Bacon sucking on the girl's nipple, to the ending. Never again. If I have to watch that movie again, it'll be too soon!

The special effects were better & more subtle than Hollow Man, from the building disappearing, to Chevy smoking, and seeing the smoke in his lungs, and seeing his outline as he blew it out, or the makeup on his face! Also, when he eats, sees it, and then gets it straight back out again, and the rain scene has an almost magical feel to it.

The whole movie deals with loneliness, alienation, and insanity, although I sometimes felt Chevy was wrong for the role, as was Sam Neill - I did NOT like his character at all. But I guess that was the whole point. Everyone will say this movie is a comedy due to Chevy being the main character, but it was quite a serious role for him, a big step away from his usual roles. Daryl Hannah was terrific, considering most of her intimate scenes are played to special effects. The last scenes over the end credits are especially touching, and bring a little tear to the eye!

Now I've finally seen this, I'm hoping that's the last I'll hear about it! It was a better movie than I was expecting, and the special effects were amazing. There's not much in the way of extras, no trailer (!), and a series of outtakes.",1099526400,4,1730,4.186186186186186

This film I thought had alot more to do with character and emotions than most filmakers would try on an ""Invisible Man"" project.
