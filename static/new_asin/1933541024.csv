7801770,5,1933541024,"Guided by God's loving Holy Spirit, Pastor Shawn Boonstra is fired up like John the Baptist and Elijah, delivering God's appearing message. Pastor Boonstra is bibically knowledgable about God's appearing according to the holy scriptures. After reviewing, I discovered he has the fruit of the spirit in knowledge. He biblically teaches about the return and shows supporting scriptures to prove it. I agree with the first reviewer. Pastor Boonstra knows his stuff, in other words, what the GOD of Heaven has shown him through Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior. This is a must dvd if you want to be ready for Christ Jesus surprising, Appearing! :)))",1321833600,,645,5.037383177570093
7801771,5,1933541024,"This is an excellent teaching on end times prophecy. He doesn't push religion at all (which I highly commend).  Mr. Boonstra sticks right to the Bible and incorporates history into his teaching to show how much of prophecy has come true already.  I highly recommend this teaching -- it makes so much sense.
The Presence is also a terrific teaching of Sean Boonstra.",1263254400,3,365,4.777777777777778
