192818,5,1573626163,"Chris Farley was one of the funniest people in the world. I was so sad and disapointed when I heard about his death. Thankfully Saturday Night Live released this compilation of some of his funniest moments on the show. This  and the movie Tommy Boy is how we can all remember him by. This compilation  is great for a laugh, it is just hilarious.",960595200,2,345,4.375
192819,5,1573626163,"I've found that most people either totally love Chris Farley or, when you bring him up, make a face and say, ""I never really thought he was funny.""  If you are in the first, and don't own this video yet, RUN  don't walk to the shopping cart and buy one. When they ran it the first  time on TV, it wasn't long after Farley's death, and I was still sad about  it. After the sober opening by Tim Meadows, however, I started laughing  pretty much non-stop till it was over. His better-known routines are on  here, such as Bennet Brower, Matt Foley, and the Chippendale's dancer,  which are all hilarious. But there's also quite a few skits that I never  saw, and we watched pretty much every week when he was in the cast. My only  complaint is that it isn't longer, and some funny skits, they only show  snippets of, like him playing Alan Hale, and the skit with Sandler where  Michael Keaton was the host and Sandler plays his cranky grandmother whom  he has to watch for 20 minutes. (if you want to see the whole skit, which  is one of the funniest things I've ever seen them do, then buy the Best of  Adam Sandler as well, because it the whole skit, plus some other great  Farley stuff not on this tape is on there). The only noticeable (if you're  a Farley fan) omission is a skit called ""The Relapse Guy"" where  he plays a guy who goes to rehab then gets wasted again over and over (it's  way funnier than it sounds, trust me). I think they thought it was a little  too close to home (though they did leave in the Ditka stuff with him faking  a heart attack-that kind of made me wince).  Every time I see this, several  things happen-- I get sad that he wasn't around long enough to make more  movies with Spade, or even by himself, because (this sounds corny) he had  so much to give. I also get pi$$ed off at him for not taking better care of  himself and dying. I also usually laugh so hard I fall off the couch. No  matter how bad of a day I had, I can watch almost any of the skits on here  and get cheered up instantly. He was a guy who could just say one line that  you would think no-one could say and make it funny, and make you fall down  laughing just the way he says it. His costars really had a hard time  keeping character, which shows even more in the dress rehersal 'blooper'  clips they show. Watch David Spade and Christina Appelgate during the Matt  FOley thing- they both have to turn away from the camera to hide their  faces because they can't keep a straight face, and when he starts in with  the ""I bet you're asking yourself 'hey Matt, how do we get back on the  right track?' "" you can see their shoulders shaking they are laughing  so hard. Sandler can't keep a straight face when he's doing the  ""Lunchlady"" song with him, either. Come to think of it, I have no  clue how anyone on stage with him could ever keep a straight face. If you  were bummed out when he died, get ready to get teary (though you'll already  have tears running down your face from laughing) when he sings, ""so  long, farewell"" as Matt Foley at the end, sitting on Phil Hartman's  lap (I could watch this without tearing up until Hartman was killed, now I  can't see the clip without getting choked up). But even if you do get  emotional, keep watching, because after the credits they stick on the one  thing I'd been hoping for the whole time-a quick clip of Farley as  ""Sandman"" on ""Nat X"". What a waste- I hope whereever he  is he knows how happy he made people during the short time he was around  (and how happy he is still making those of us who thought he was funny).",959904000,74,3575,4.211225997045791
192820,5,1573626163,"Over the years, I would see Chris Farley from time to time and find him only mildly amusing. I'm not sure what inspired me to buy this video in the first place...but I'm very glad I did. My wife and I were doubled over on  the floor, totally out of control, as we watched some of the bits in this  video. These are just priceless sketches from the Saturday Night Live  archives.
In case you happen to recall some of his funnier moments on  SNL, here's a list of most of the routines that are on this video:  ""Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker"", ""Chippendale's  Audition"", ""The Chris Farley Show"" (interviews with Jeff  Daniels and Paul McCartney), ""Bennett Brouwer"", ""Roseanne  and Tom"", ""El Nino"", ""Lunch Lady"", ""Japanese  Jeopardy"", ""Herlihy Boy"".

It also has ""Matt Foley: motivational  speacker"", ""Lunch Lady Land"",and many more skits. It is  great for the Chris Farley fan. I wasn't even a real fan till I saw SNL.  Now I'm hooked on SNL!

192971,4,1573626163,"I'm a big fan of Farley and this DVD is great, except for the omission of a skit that aired when they first played this show on television the Saturday after his death. It has always been one of my favorite Farley skits. David Hyde Pierce, Jeanane Garofalo, and David Spade are all in it with Farley, in a late 19th Century village where they are all prim and proper and go ice skating, Chris falls through the ice and starts yelling and carrying on in typical Farley fashion yelling at Garofalo 'what do mean whatever shall you do, save me you stupid whore!!' I would have given the DVD 5 stars but the fact that they altered it to add the skit of the interview with some Wilson Phillips stuff or whatever (i just FF that skit, i despise it) and the omission of the Ice Fall Skit have kept me from giving it 5 stars. You won't be disapppointed, it's a great DVD though...",1144454400,3,872,4.259036144578313
192972,5,1573626163,"Chris Farley was on ""Saturday Night Live"" for five years. During that time, he blessed the show with some of its most memorable moment, from the Chippendales audition to Matt Foley, motivational speaker to the Super Fans, everything he did was uprorarious. Inspired by John Belushi, Chris was also arguably the show's best physical comedian, a trait hebecame well known for. Sadly, Chris died of a drug overdose in 1997, only 34 years old. However, his rich legacy lives on with ""Saturday Night Live - The Best Of Chris Farley"".

All of the great moments I've talked about are here - Chippendales, Matt Foley, Todd O'Conner, and so much more. Some of the lesser known bits had me in stitches as well. Chris was hilarious as Andrew Giuliani, pouncing all over Kevin Nealon (as Mayor Giuliani), making fart noises, etc. This is probably my favorite cold opening of all time. The ""Lunchlady Land"" musical skit may be just another way to show off Adam Sandler's hilarious songwriting talents, but Farley steals the show as the portly lunchlady (mole and all) rocking out as Sandler endless spews out choruses about sloppy joes and hoagies and grinders. And my mom absolutely loves the ""Focus On Beauty"" sketch (unfortunately this sketch has been heavily truncated due to time).

I do have a few bones to pick, however. The dvd says that includes all of Chris's famous characters are here. Well, that's a bit of an overstatement. Some only appear breifly in short montages. For example, Chris's chubby 1/3 of the Gap Girls, Cindy Crawford, was as much a part of that sketch as Adam Sandler and David Spade was, and to have her relegated for appearing 30 seconds tops in the drag montage was a cheat. Likewise, I thought the ""Zagat's"" sketch was hysterical, but it too is featured briefly in the same montage. Also, two characters Chris did often alongside Chris Rock, B-Fats (from I'm Chillin'"") and Sandman (from ""The Dark Side With Nat X"") are nowhere to be found.

Despite these minor complaints, this is an excellent look at one of ""SNL's"" finest. We all miss you Chris.",1110672000,2,2069,4.7899159663865545
192973,4,1573626163,"Finally had a chance to watch this Chris Farley DVD last night.  Like the other two I own (Will Farrel and Phil Hartman), it had some very funny moments, and a couple of not-so-funny moments.  I thought the ""super fans"" skit was great, especially where Michael Jordan starts talking about his foundation, and the 4 guy's minds start wandering off ('da bears, 'da bears, Ditka, Sausage, 'da bulls...).  I also thought the question about coach Ditka going up against a hurricane (named Ditka) was pretty amusing.  Matt Foley, motivational speaker was hilarious!  'Look Dad, we got ourselves a regular Bill Shakespear here', and 'I hear you've been using paper not for writing lately, but rolling'.  That could have been Farley's best role.  Also, the commentary guy who kept using double-finger quotes, as he progressively got more gross ('a guy who doesn't let his scabs heal', or 'eats his dandruff flakes').  And lastly, as the guy who flips out when he finds out his coffee has been replaced by Folgers instant coffee.  Thought that was very funny.

Some of the skits that didn't do much for me was the 'lunch lady' skit (looks like it had been written by 10 year olds), and the one where he's in drag talking about his latest line of skin products (Christina Applegate was REALLY miscast as Cher), and lastly.....as good a job as I thought he did as Rudy Giuliani's son Andrew, I thought it wasn't too professional making fun of a nine year old that has ADS.  Overall, I'd give the compilation a 4/5 rating.  The only skit I wish they included was the 'Little Women' one, where Chris breaks thru the ice, and hurls off a bunch of obscenities to the other women to rescue him.  I remember the first time I saw that, and had stomach pains from laughing so much.

He was really a great comic!",1110240000,2,1792,4.629746835443038
192985,4,1573626163,"First i want to say that this does have alot of Farley's funny skits,but theres some missing gems and some of his better skits were shown only partially while some of his more forgettable skits were played in its entirety which made no sense to me.the only had one Matt Foley skit in its entirety which is undoubtedly the funniest character he ever did on SNL.the show a quick clip of the one where he steps in dog crap and falls through a window in the same house in another matt foley skit but they just show that brief part not the whole scene. Also they omitted Matt Foley as Santa Claus which was one of his funniest skits ever. Its on the SNL Christmas DVD but still that was no reason to leave this great skit out of his personal tribute DVD.He also does another guy at the newsdesk which they never showed the entire clips of. I forget the characters name but he always does the quotation marks with his fingers as he explains why some people don't like him. But anyways there is a few good skits here. My favorites are the one Matt Foley skit they gave us in entirety,The spoof on the old folgers crystals commercials ""secretly replacing real coffee with instant coffee in fine restaurants"" when farley flips out when he finds out he didn't get real coffee,that one had me aughing alot. And i liked the one where its like a 1950's winter setting with everyone talkng so nice and then chris farley suddenly screaming obscenities when he falls through the ice. But aside from thta as i said they left out alot of his best stuff. I am not sure if Lauren Michaels hand picked which would be his ""best skits"" but if he did he needs to realize his taste isn't in touch with most farely fans,they left alot of no brainers off this DVD that should have definitely been on this DVD.Hopefully they will do a better job in the future if they try to cash in on Farley again with another best of farely in the future but i am not holding my breath on that cause i doubt they'll do a best of on the same character twice. P.S. the one where he tries out for chippendales is funny as hell to,forget to mention that one,glad they included it in this DVD at least.",1102982400,3,2155,4.310344827586207
192986,5,1573626163,"In his short tenure on this earth, Chris Farley provided us with some of the funniest moments in ""Saturday Night Live"" history. Heavily inspired by John Belushi (not just in his comedy but his dangerous lifestyle), he suddenly became the show's most talented physical comedians, bringing the pratfall back to households.
5 years of classic comedy has been put on this dvd. Farley created for himslef a variety of classic charcaters for himself, including Matt Foley (who lives in a van down by the river!!!), Todd O'Connor of ""Superfans"" and Barney The Chippendale Auditioner. All of these classic characters are here. Also, there's his ""exciting"" impression of Laurie Davis in the ""Focus On Beauty"" sketch. There are several montages that just to show how funny he was: one where he's in drag, a montage of his talk show, one showcasing his physical comedy, an impressions montage, and one featuring outtakes from Dress Rehersal.
Overall, very good. My one complaint may seem odd. There's not enough sketches featruing Adam Sandler! I know that the focus is supposed to be on Farley, but he and Adam shared so many great skecthes together, and they obviosuly bought out the best of each other. The ones with him are good, but it would have been better if ""Zagat's"" and ""Gap Girls"" (both featured briefly in the ""Drag Montage) were on here. But still, it's an excellent dvd.",1089590400,3,1374,4.901287553648069

He forms his fingers into quotation mark things and says funny stuff on his imperfect things about him.  like i'm not that attractive and ""i don't wash regularly""its really funny and how come know one says anything about it.  Your only cool if you write a review about this skit so every review writer who wrote one your not cool enough to write about chris farley.  I think its the funniest skit and its not my fault that all of you people suck ass.",1082332800,,598,4.36036036036036
192988,5,1573626163,"This is one of the funniest DVDs I own.  Chris Farley is incredibly funny and will do anything for a laugh.
My favorite skits are:
The Drug Counselor.  David Spade and Christina Applegate each have difficulty keeping a straight face during this skit where their parents surprise them with a drug counselor played by Chris Farley.
The coffee commercial.  I must have played this one 50 times.  Watch Chris go crazy on a waiter who has the never to switch his favorite coffee with instant.  He even quotes Scarlette O'Hara.
This is a must have DVD.",1081296000,3,546,4.645833333333333
192989,3,1573626163,"Well, I was a little disappointed in this dvd. Chris Farley was one of the greatest comedians to emerge in the past 20 years, and I was hoping that ""Saturday Night Live"" and Broadway Video would put together a concise tribute dvd that would feature about 20 of his greatest skits, plus a bonus feature including tributes from fellow cast members like Adam Sandler and Mike Meyers who worked with him in countless skits over the years (instead we get a short tribute by Tim Meadows). What is included here is a few classic sketches, plus some montages (""Chris In Drag"" ! Wow!).
Which is not to say that this is a terrible dvd. ""Matt Foley"", ""Japanese Game Show"" (also available on ""The Best Of Mike Meyers""), ""Superfans"". ""Lunchlady"", ""Schmitt's Gay"" and ""The Herlihy Boy"" are all classics in their own right. However, I was sort of disgruntled by the montages that are spread out across the dvd and butcher ""SNL"" standards like ""The Gap Girls"" and ""Zagat's"" to mere snippets. (Both these skits are available on other dvds). Similarly, the ""Chris Farley Show"" montage cuts out some of the best interviews (though I'm glad they kept in the Paul McCartney one). Still, you can't be upset by the inclusion of ""Chippendales"".
So, overall it's an okay dvd, but nowhere as great as the ones dedicated to Mike Meyers, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler and the countless others that have been honored with their own collection of classics.",1075939200,6,1437,4.775100401606426
192990,4,1573626163,"Chris Farly was one of America's greatest comedienes. I feel bad that he died. My friend thinks Chris is a loser, becuase he killed himself with drugs. That may be true, but you gotta feel sorry for the guy. He was giving his life to comedy, and he just couldn't take it. Anyway, I've never seen this DVD, but I saw it on TV. I just saw the ""Chipendales"" skit a few days ago, and I laughed my [rear] off! Chris is soooooooooo funny!

Every time I see it I laugh so hard that I almost pee my pants!  This movie is a must see.  My friends and I love to quote this show everytime we are together!

192993,5,1573626163,"This SNL Best of Chris Farley collection came out not long after his premature death, and it is a little different from other tapes I have seen in this series.  While we do see some full-length skits, we also have scattered montages of Chris being Chris (which more often than not involved the destruction of furniture and, on occasion, brick walls).  For me, the one complete Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker, skit makes the video worthwhile all by itself.  His speech about not doing drugs to a brother and sister (played by David Spade and Christina Applegate, both of whom struggle to keep a straight face while Farley never falters) is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on Saturday Night Live.  Then there is the Chippendales dancer tryout skit, where Chris has a dance-off with Patrick Swayze, which is unforgettable.  Chris Farley was comfortable with himself and his body, and he had no qualms about performing self-deprecating humor.  Of course, there is a Super Fans skit included here (""da Bears""), but watching his character having a few heart attacks is not quite as funny as it was when he was still alive.  You get highlights of three episodes of the ""Chris Farley Show"" and a very funny Focus on Beauty infomercial with Farley playing cosmetics guru Lori Davis.  A couple of the sketches here can also be found on the Best of Adam Sandler tape, but they seem more at home here given the fact that Farley stole those scenes.  It's scary to think how many times the SNL guys put Farley in a dress, many examples of which can be found in this collection, but he never seemed to care.  A truly gifted entertainer and all-around funny man, Chris Farley gave everything he had to make us laugh, and I for one will remember him for many years to come.",1041033600,14,1768,4.637820512820513
193024,5,1573626163,"Of all the SNL tapes(all of them pretty darn good), this is probably the best one of them all.  Everything is compiled so well and the laughs practically never stop.  Plus, Farley was one of the greatest SNL members ever.  I strongly recommend this tape to any SNL fan or anybody who just wants a good laugh.",1029024000,2,308,4.368421052631579
193025,5,1573626163,"Though some may disagree, Chris Farley was a comic genius (if you don't believe me just watch TOMMY BOY). The characters he played were often loud, but rarely offensive and usually hilarious (compare that to the last five or six years of SNL; there is a huge difference). In part, his humoring was so appealing because Chris looked just like a normal guy and he loved making people laugh.

This collection of SNL sketches and skits is a fitting tribute to Farley. The DVD includes ""Andrew Giuliani""; ""Matt Foley, Motivational Speaker""; ""Chippendales""; ""Superfans-Jordan""; snippets of ""The Chris Farley Show""; a physical comedy montage; and ""Lunchlady"". There are a few omissions from the Chris Farley repertoire. However, most of the best ones are here. My only complaint is that there should have been more of certain characters (why wasn't there more ""Tom Foley"" sketches?).

A wonderful DVD that any Chris Farley fan will welcome, and that non-fans can at least watch to appreciate the humor of Chris Farley.",1019001600,,1011,5.047904191616767
