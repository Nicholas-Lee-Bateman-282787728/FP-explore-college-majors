7839928,3,6303164382,"The only thing standing between you and that psychopath in there is me. Sara (Monaghan) was an embedded photo journalist who lost her eyesight in an attack. She is living day to day and getting by. When she comes home she finds her husband murdered and no idea who did it or why. When Hollander (Keaton) enters the scene she realizes why he was murdered and her only hope of getting out alive to to find something she didn't know existed. This is a movie that is worth seeing, even though it is fairly generic and predictable. The real reason to watch this though is to see Keaton as a bad guy. He does such a good job in this type of role and I really wish he would do it more often. The biggest flaw with this movie is that it took a pretty decent 45 minute TV show idea and stretched it out into an hour and a half. It started to lose steam and get way too repetitive toward the middle and stumbled to the end. Once again though, the movie isn't all that terrible and is worth seeing once. Overall, an OK movie that is generic and predictable but the reason to watch is to see Keaton as a psycho bad guy, he really saves the movie. I give it a B-.",1429574400,,1150,4.092920353982301

7839930,3,6303164382,"In Penthouse North Michelle Monaghan plays Sara, a photojournalist who has lost her eyesight in Afghanistan three years ago. Now she is living quietly with her rich and kind boyfriend Ryan (Andrew W. Walker) in a spacy New York penthouse. But today, on New Year's Eve, there is someone watching Sara very closely. And obviously he is not Ryan.

The films premise may remind us of Audrey Hepburns classic thriller Wait Until Dark, but sorry, Penthouse North is nothing but an OK thriller that is predictable and even ludicrous. This is a home invasion thriller where no one thinks or acts rationally. Michael Keaton appears in a key role, but there is not much to say about his performance. Barry Sloane and Kaniehtiio Horn also appear.

Penthouse North is director Joseph Rubens first film in about nine years since The Forgotten starring Julianne Moore. Back in the 1990s he made such so-so thrillers as Sleeping with the Enemy (starring Julia Roberts) and The Good Son (with young Elijah Wood), and those who still remember these films know what his latest work would be like. Penthouse North is a slick and fast-paced, but forgettable.",1402185600,,1138,4.891191709844559
7839931,3,6303164382,"Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) is a war photographer who gets blinded by a suicide bomber. The film starts three years later. We get an indication Sara is a strong person. She lives in an expensive Penthouse with a rich boyfriend (Andrew Walker). It isn't long before this becomes a home break-in film with Michael Keaton and Barry Sloane as the bad guys. It seems her boyfriend wasn't as nice as she thought.

There must be a 100 home break-in films out there, some even involve a blind person. While not a bad film, this one doesn't bring anything new worthwhile to the table. A film you can wait to see.

A reclusive, blind photojournalist lives quietly in a New York penthouse, until a smooth but sadistic criminal looking for a hidden fortune enters her life.

Review - 3/5
Michelle Monaghan does a wonderful portrayal of a blind innocent victim. And who plays one of the bad guys? Michael Keaton! I could personally watch him in anything. The story is not that well written though. More of a dramatic Lifetime movie than anything. But I'll take it since Keaton's roles are getting more sparse and rare as he creeping up in age.",1396137600,,537,4.712765957446808

Well as you can guess it is a film that you must see....",1041638400,3,288,5.020833333333333
