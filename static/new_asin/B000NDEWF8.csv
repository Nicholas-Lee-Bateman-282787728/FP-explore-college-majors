8349676,3,B000NDEWF8,"This is not a bad overview of the Bahamas, especially if like me you don't know much about it.

I watched this video from my library, and it said it was made in 1986. I assume what I saw is the same as what's shown here on Amazon - the cover is the same.

This video is very old and does not have much professional polish. The narrator sounds rather jaded about the Bahamas.

Thw video is targeted specifically for ""boatmen"" and pilots. It shows a lot of aerial shots of the islands and discusses matters related to boats and planes, such as where you can get fuel, how to approach a harbor along a specific channel, etc. Since this video is now so old, this information is surely outdated.

But even if you don't care about boating and piloting in the Bahamas, I found it a decent introduction to the islands. There are some shots of being on the islands themselves. I'm sure much has changed since this video was made, but I liked seeing it as it formerly was.

Beware that this video contains a few shots of partial nudity - topless bathers seen from the back and side. This cheapened the video for me.",1356739200,,1105,4.318840579710145
8349677,2,B000NDEWF8,"I have been to, spent time in and sailed through The Bahamas by private boat 14 times, the first over the winter of 1994-1995. I wanted a good DVD that I could use to show friends and family why I like the islands so much. This DVD is not what I was looking for. I think this DVD is a disk version of a very old and not well made, film, parts of it were out of date way back in 1994. If you like The Bahamas and can get this DVD for a buck, fine; but don't waste more than that on it.",1294531200,,484,3.6634615384615383
