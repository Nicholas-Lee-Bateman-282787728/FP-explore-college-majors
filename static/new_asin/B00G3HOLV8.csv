6054110,5,B00G3HOLV8,"A couple of years ago, I reviewed an excellent movie titled DETECTIVE DEE: MYSTERY OF THE PHANTOM FLAME.  The review was lost when my blog crashed over a year ago, but my impression of the film still remains; it is an eye-popping masterpiece that dazzles and delights.  Director Hark Tsui is back with a prequel to that film, and although Detective Dee is younger in this one, he does not fail to impress.  Much like its predecessor, YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is a fast-paced, action-filled masterpiece that entertains on several levels.

Because this is a prequel, the same actor could not portray Detective Dee.  Andy Lau did an excellent job of bringing Dee to life in the first one, and actor Mark Chao continues this tradition with this film.  Both men have unique traits and characteristics that help define the legendary inspector, and both do a great job in this role.

YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is shot well and looks amazing onscreen.  I don't use this phrase much, but this film is literally a visual feast for the eyes.  It uses a lot of CG, which is interwoven with the live-action almost flawlessly.  This, therefore, allows for deeper immersion into the story and thus a more entertaining experience.

As with the previous film, the action in this one is intense, and the fight scenes are full of wow-inducing moves.  The wire-work continues to impress, not to mention the fight choreography itself.  You just basically cant ask for better in a martial-arts film.

The storyline of YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is also impressive.  The narrative never drops off nor does it grow stale; the story moves at a nice pace and there are no dull moments or stalled dialogue.  Whereas my sole complaint about the previous film was that it was a bit long, that is not the case here.  This film is right where it needs to be in length and dazzles from start to finish.

YOUNG DETECTIVE DEE: RISE OF THE SEA DRAGON is a definite win for me, and I highly suggest you give it a look.  It hits store shelves next week, so make a note to check it out.",1391558400,46,2102,4.557333333333333

6054144,5,B00G3HOLV8,"Great 3D! Really enjoyable, extremely commercial movie. But screen froze at 1:06:51. Nothing worked to get it moving. On closer examination, looks like it could be a Blu Ray-R rather than an actual Blu Ray; which makes me suspect it could also be a glorified bootleg. In any case, am returning it for a full refund.

Update: Based on others having no playback issues (and Amazon no longer carrying it), I found and purchased another new copy on E-Bay. I'm pleased to report there were no problems. So, evidently, the original disk was simply defective. For that reason, I've changed my rating from 1 star to 5. 5th star is for the 3D.",1457481600,,634,4.610619469026549

6054157,2,B00G3HOLV8,"This is not at all what I'd expected. I've read the Judge Dee novels by RH van Gulik. Read them all several times. I was hoping for a movie version that would be like these stories. Well, I do like the Dee person in the movie. He looks like I would expect a younger Dee to look. And his character traits seem as great as that of the judge in those beloved books. And I do like the beauty of the scenery, architecture and interiors. Even the grim fantastic places have eye appeal. But I hate the stupid artificial agility by which the characters spin like dervishes, brandish horrible looking weapons and leap tall buildings at a single bound. Yeccchhh! Too much noise, too much violence, too much that's ridiculous. My husband likened the action to cartoons where the character gets flattened by a steam roller and bounces right back in the next frame.

6054193,5,B00G3HOLV8,"Absolutely excellent.  The scenery in ""Young Detective Dee"" is so alive it crackles with life and is just beautiful in this production.

The story is great.  Detective Dee is like the James Bond of China with his cool and smarts, the difference being he is always an honorable character and doesn't indulge in tongue in cheek humor or  always chasing after the women.

Detective Dee is such an unflappable hero and an admirable, respectable symbol of goodness and ethics.  Because he is true to his principles and to himself, he prevails for the good of all concerned. Highly recommend  both ""Rise of the Sea Dragon"" and ""Mystery of the Phantom Flame,"" in which the martial arts are especially amazing.

I've looked all over for more Detective Dee movies but can't find anything but these two.  If anyone knows of more, can you please post in the ""Comments"" section?

Thanks, and I hope you and your children enjoy these movies as much as I did.

6054195,4,B00G3HOLV8,"A huge sea monster, a beautiful courtesan and a young fighter of justice with the observing skills and reasoning powers of Sherlock Holmes. Hong Kong director Tsui Hark blends crime mystery, love romance and martial arts action in ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon."" And he does it in the way only he can do.

This is a prequel to the legendary director's hit movie ""Detective Dee and The Mystery of the Phantom Flame."" Set in the year 655 (34 years before ""the Phantom Flame""), Tsui Hark's second ""Detective Dee"" film follows the story of the young detective Dee Renjie (Mark Chao), who has just arrived to the city of Luoyang.

The great naval fleet of China's ruling Tang Dynasty was recently destroyed by the ""Sea Dragon."" Not only that; Yin (Angelababy), a courtesan to be sacrificed for the monster, is nearly kidnaped by a mysterious creature. Empress Wu Zetian (Carina Lau) orders Detective Yuchi Zhenjin (Feng Shaofeng) to solve the strange case. Of course, young Dee Renjie also gets involved, forming an unlikely pair with Yuchi Zhenjin, who just doesn't trust the newcomer.

Admittedly the story is weaker than the first one, lacking the mystery that intrigues us like the ""spontaneous combustion"" of the original. Still, ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon"" has enough action and suspense to keep the viewers interested. Enjoy it.",1411603200,,1363,4.943231441048035

6054213,4,B00G3HOLV8,"I have been watching a lot of Chinese and Japanese theater recently. The story telling is different than the canned Hollywood scripts which may take some folks out of their comfort zone. That said, the movies I have watched have been full of great scenes, solid action, well done characters. Young Dee was no different. The action sequences were fun and I connected well with teh characters despite losing some emotional depth via subtitles. You get used to that though.  The story was well told and took some fun twists and turns.  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I have already seen another Dee story, Phantom Flame, that I thought was slightly better and because some of the subtitles moved faster than I could read the first three words - I realize that can be a tough balance to stay with the characters on screen but I do need a moment to read what is on the screen.  That only happened a few times though.  About a fifth of the way through, my teen daughter plopped down beside me and started watching. She only had to ask one or two questions and part of that was because she missed the first few scenes. She really enjoyed the movie as well  Overall, this was a good adventure and I hope to see more Dee movies come out in the future.",1408233600,,1266,4.370212765957447

I don't mind a little wire combat, but this film relies on it a great deal more and some of it is not very well done.
Also, there are longer portions of animation which look very poor quality.  The English subtitles appear so briefly in many cases you only have a half second to read them, so in trying to follow the rapid dialog, the visual is lost.
This story has more fantasy elements  than Phantom Flame so the detective work is less clever or believable.

6054226,1,B00G3HOLV8,"This movie is horrible, horrible, and I do mean horrible.

The acting, storyline, CGI, action sequence, music, and even the camera angles were just bad.

The only thing this film has going is the central actress Angela Yeung Wing. She does her best to rescue this movie from oblivion, but she fails to do so.

I totally lost interest in this movie after 15 minutes. I regret that I even finished watching this movie.

Pros:
1)Angela Yeung Wing...maybe.
2)One notably good fight sequence.

Cons:
1)Horrible acting that nobody believes.
2)Horrible story that makes zero sense.
3)Horrible action sequences (not even worthy of a video game CGI).
4)The movie twists into even deeper horribleness in the 2nd half. It is as if everyone just gave up rescuing this film.",1403827200,,761,4.9140625
6054227,5,B00G3HOLV8,"The cover likens this to Sherlock Holmes and it feels very Guy Ritchie's version, in a good way -

The Dee in the film is confident, not overly arrogant, and willing to explain how he deduced what he does to others showing his true genius. Every clue leads the story into a new direction and a new turn making this an edge of the seat ride from opening credits until the end.

The cinematography and effects bring this film to life, and very few moments feel too unbelievable to draw you out of the film. I have too many great things to say about this movie to do it justice now.

Detective Dee is a supremely confident sleuth engaged in solving several mysteries rolled into one. It takes place in the distant past when Emperors still ruled and there were rivals trying to overthrow them. I would have given it four stars had the dialogue been at a higher level. However, again, I found it very entertaining and well worth the rental price. This is the 2nd Detective Dee movie. The first was similar and enjoyable as well.",1402358400,,615,4.703703703703703
6054230,5,B00G3HOLV8,"I love big budget oriental films whether Korean, Japanese, or in this case, Chinese.  It is a portal into another world with colors, shapes, patterns, and movement.  Of course it is not realistic: they didn't have washing machines or sidewalks beside the cart tracks in those days but the visuals make all the unrealism worth watching.  The treachery, the heroism, the mysticism make the film worth the time spent watching.  I equally loved Detective Dee: the Phantom Flame for the same reasons.  They are rewarding ways to spend a quiet evening tripping out into another world.  No six guns, cowboy hats, or horses here: instead, one gets wire acrobatics, exquisite costumes, social injustice, observations of the world's first acknowledged Detective!",1402272000,2,752,5.225

6054259,3,B00G3HOLV8,"This is not nearly so good as the first and has that hastily thrown together look of too many sequels. I hear the 3-D version takes care of much of that. Too bad because the story, presented too quickly with second-rate subtitles, is not bad and loaded with cool, little mysteries you're not given time to solve, sometimes ya don't even know there is a mystery 'till Dee solves it. Half way through I was watching Tsui Hark's lifelong obsession with breaking every law of physics as much as watching the story. But the character Dee is every bit as suitable to endless sequels as are Sherlock Holmes and 007, for example. But, come on, folks, care must be taken.",1398902400,,662,4.525

6054282,5,B00G3HOLV8,"If you saw the first Detective Dee movie then I think you will like this prequel. In this movie Dee now a young detective ends up aiding in solving this sea dragon case which is more involved than I believe he had bargained for. I like this as you really get to see the extent to Dee's intelligence and sheer uncanny ability to absorb and recall small details from memory which aid him in his detective efforts. Like its predecessor Young Detective Dee does involve a bit of comedic hijinks (especially in the form of the apprentice's master) but it does not take away from the seriousness of the case or storyline.

Definitely a great buy and as a piece of advice stay tuned a bit after the credits start to roll for a few more laughs.",1395187200,,736,4.372262773722627
6054283,4,B00G3HOLV8,"This is a very solid adventure/fantasy film loosely based on Chinese Tang dynasty history. The script is pretty strong for this genre of film. There are plot holes and generic villains (from the ""Eastern Islands"" speaking mock Japanese, yet it's not Japan *wink* *wink*), but the chemistry between Dee and his rival Detective Yuchi, and between Dee and his doctor ""Watson"" Shatuo are well-acted and fun to watch. The action sequences are impressive climaxing in a well choreographed fight on ropes inside a ravine. In addition, there are some beautiful (computer-generated) shots of cosmopolitan capital of the Tang Empire filled with people from all of Asia, and some humorous pokes at the pompous imperial court's expense. Carina Lau returns once more as a younger version of the haughty and crafty Empress Wu from the previous film, and her performance makes you want to bow at her feet to curry her favor. The weakest point is actually the sea dragon itself, which seems too over the top even though the CGI is acceptable, and the damsel in distress subplot is also rather superfluous but I suppose the actress Angelababy provides the eye candy this movie needs. Overall, anyone who like martial art film will get a  kick out of this film, more enjoyment if coming in with some knowledge of Chinese history.",1395014400,,1311,4.932126696832579

6054285,5,B00G3HOLV8,"If you have read any of my previous reviews, anyone will know that I love stylized martial arts movies. With that said, the movies also need an engaging plot. This movie is good from start to finish. Even the closing credits are good so make sure to watch. I was really impressed by the action done by Feng Shaofeng. Everyone did a magnificent job, but he was the man and did more wire work than everyone else. If you are looking for a deep  movie, this is not it. However, if you are looking for a movie with action, a bit of comedy and great special effects, this is it.",1394928000,3,572,4.2

6054288,5,B00G3HOLV8,"Both Detective Dee movies are great; this one I liked slightly less than The Mystery of the Phantom Flame but I think I'm in the minority on this.  But that's like saying I liked winning 1.5 million dollars better than winning 1.25 million dollars.  Both things are great.  Watched both twice, the next day and was as entranced throughout the second watching.",1394409600,,359,4.758064516129032
6054289,4,B00G3HOLV8,I like the Detective Dee films. They are a mixture of Martial Arts and Who Done It movies. The only negative I have and it's not about the movie but with the english sub-titles. The words blended into the scene of the film and to me was hard to read at times. But other than that it was a very enjoyable movie and well worth watching.,1394409600,,334,4.075757575757576

Here's hoping for more Detective Dee in the near future!",1393804800,,262,5.55
6054292,3,B00G3HOLV8,"I'm about to order this DVD based on the good reviews for an all-round good action movie. However, it should be pointed out that there was a real historical person called Detective Di Renjie who really wasn't a martial art expert, but was a good detective. For a better portrayal, there is  a pretty good mainland China-produced TV series called 'Detective Di Renjie'. One season of it (with English sub-titles) is available here on Amazon. Another DVD with a similar type of TV series based on a real historical figure is called 'Judge Bao' (also available on Amazon). Enjoy!",1393632000,,576,4.818181818181818
6054293,5,B00G3HOLV8,another fine movie with Detective Dee in it.  Do not confuse this with the Judge Dee series of books.  This is fantasy and mystery and totally delightful.,1393632000,,154,4.666666666666667
6054294,3,B00G3HOLV8,"I enjoyed the first Detective Dee film ""The Mystery of the Phantom Flame"", but I am kind of at a loss for understanding this story. I wish they offered this film with the English dubbing option because the english sub-titles on this film went by so fast that I couldn't keep up with the story.

The sub-titles will go by so fast that you will miss so much of the dialogue.  It'll change twice inside of just a single second, and maybe three times inside of just two seconds.  The wording of the sub-titles can be from 8 to 10 words at a time, and will change again before you can get to the fifth word. This was so annoying that I had to give up on this film about half way though it because, after about an hour of watching, I still didn't quite know where the story was going.

Anyway, when I did get a chance to actually watch the scenes where there were no dialogue with subtitles, I found that alot of the action scenes were rather annoying too. It had alot of silly ""fairy-like"" flying around that just didn't reflect common sense motions of true inertia. Most movies that do this, kinda kill the appeal of the whole movie for me anyway.

I miss the days when karate scenes and fight scenes weren't enhanced by wires and special effects. No matter how much effort they apply to make it look realistic, it still never does.

Well, anyway, I may try to watch this film once more, perhaps with my pause button at the ready to catch a fast changing sub-title passage. But the appeal has already waned on me because of the silly ""Wuxia"" styled acrobatics.

With the near 10 minute closing credits, I caught the name of the guy who put in the sub-titles. His name is Tony Rayns.  Perhaps he should reconsider another career, or at least consider asking if he could re-do his work here and re-issue this movie again.  Well, we know that isn't going to happen.  Maybe, next time, they will preview this film with his sub-title work, and ask for a re-do if it is necessary, before they mass produce it, as this film should have been done.",1393372800,,2035,4.35978835978836
6054295,4,B00G3HOLV8,"I have to admit what got me to watch this movie was the director's name. I grew up watching the golden age of movies in the 90s and Tsui Hark is just one of those directors in which I'm probably going to watch his movies regardless. His recent ones( Seven Swords, The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate) have been entertaining and so I expected this movie to be no less. I was not disappointed.  Young Detective Dee is a prequel to Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame- but you really don't have to watch that one first. It connected but kinda isn't really so it's fine as a stand alone.
  Mark Chao plays the brilliant Detective Dee in his earlier years before he becomes the polished, methodic version of himself  in the first film. I was actually hesitant to watch this film at first because I was not familiar at all with Mark Chao's acting..and looking on Wikipedia... I haven't seen very many of his movies as he is still fairly new. He was decent as the main character and I really had to remind myself not to compare his interpretation with Andy Lau's because their acting styles are different. Mark Chao's portrayal of Detective Dee might have been what he would have been in his youth, but sometimes I found that he seemed kind of lost. I'm not sure if that was what he intended to portray- but at times, he seems very impassive and comes off as a bit of a mouth breather instead of being the brilliant Dee but it's far and few in between and most likely intending to show how Detective Dee wasn't always the master of mysteries and had his moments growing up...but I digress. All in all Mark Chao gave a solid performance as Dee. I did not find him lacking really in the character. Carina Lau makes another appearance in here reprising her role as the Empress. She's not in here as much but she always was a very respected actress that I haven't seen in awhile so it was good to see her again. I swear, she doesn't age a bit. Feng Shaofeng plays Detective Yuchi- a very interesting character. I have seen this actor in some of the other movies that he has been in and he was very good in this role. He did a great job of portraying just the right balance of defensiveness/helpfulness that defines his character and his interactions with Dee were amusing. Lin Gengxin is Dee's sidekick in this movie and he pretty much is exactly what you would think his character would be like next to Detective Dee. He is good for some light amusement and basically being Robin to Batman. This actor I had seen in more of his TV series and not really any of his movies. He has a face which I kept thinking was familiar and wasn't until I googled him did I make the connection. He's good as one of the group. Kim Bum plays Yuan Zhen another character in the subplot and he's good in the few scenes that he was in. Angelababy is Yin Ruiji, the capital's most beautiful courtesan. She is good as another character in the mystery but her character didn't have much depth to her. All in all, this was a pretty solid cast.
  The mystery  really is about a huge sea monster that comes out at night and attacks the area. The palace orders Dective Yushi to get on it and solve the mystery. At the same time, Detective Dee arrives in the Imperial Capital to become an officer of the law. He clashes with Detective Yushi and gets himself into all sorts of trouble. The biggest mystery is really the Sea Dragon.  You also have a couple of other minor mysteries that of course, Detective Dee and company all solve and wrap up everything neatly at the end.  To be honest, the premise of the mystery, the reasoning behind it and the execution of the plans to completion is a tad bit ludicrous. If you are looking for a mystery that will leave you wracking your mind to find out the solution then this movie isn't really for you.  The problem with the Detective Dee movies is that it's not really about deep plot stories, etc., etc., It's more of this is the mystery, here is the reason why these events are occurring and this is the solution. Oh and yeah, some of these details are weak and hardly plausible at times but, whatever.  If this movie didn't have Mark Chao pulling off the delivery of the brilliant Detective Dee and making otherwise lame details seem credible and if Tsui Hark hadn't done such a great job of effects and seamlessly weaving the direction of the movie, I would have said that this movie was ridiculous. You have to take this movie as it is. It's not a super complicated plot. It's silly at times, but it works. The finished product is a light, amusing and fun piece of work. This movie is typical Tsui Hark as of now- great 3d, slow mo effects at certain times, good choreography,  brilliant colors, and yes, people flying around fighting. Personally, I think all of those things add up to a very enjoyable two hours.",1393286400,6,4834,4.400895856662934
6054296,5,B00G3HOLV8,"OK, perhaps a bit cultural centric but if you imaginatively wanted to know what Sherlock was doing in a previous life long ago, well, quite a long time ago then Dee is your man.

6054299,4,B00G3HOLV8,"I bought this movie sight unseen as I loved the first Detective Dee movie so much, a lot of that was due to the presence of Andy Lau, but I really enjoyed Mark Chao in the lead here. An excellent plot, cast, and special effects makes this one worth seeing. I disagree that one must see the 3-D version to fully appreciate the movie, as this ""flat"" version is fine. Most movies look better at the movie theater if one wants to take that view, but how many of us own a movie theater? We must do with what he have and for me that is a ""2-D"" TV in my living room.

There is suspense and mystery here as Dee finds his way as a new member of the local justice department, he is aided by a somewhat humorous sidekick (medical assistant) who he meets in the infirmary and convinces to go along with him. There is a beautiful lady in distress of course, played by ""Angelababy."" Then there is the monster, actually two monsters, a man sized one and the sea creature, where did they come from and what will they do?  One of the mysteries in the first part of the film is differentiating between the good guys and the bad guys. Carina Lau reprises her role as The Empress.

There are many awesome computer effects and some fall short of the mark, but the sheer scale of this movie makes small errors forgivable. If you liked the earlier Dee movie then you'll probably enjoy this one too, a Tsui Hark movie is usually full of action with an interesting cast, I haven't enjoyed all his films as I find them a bit too much but this one is one I'll watch over and over.",1393113600,,1553,4.204697986577181
6054300,4,B00G3HOLV8,"Some of the most original thinking for  movie making is coming from this genera. America movie making seems more and more targeted to a audience of morons and I say this as an American myself. I often find ""mainstream"" movies in America to be insulting by how far it's dumbed down. Subtitles may not be for everyone but, I think it helps to immerse the viewer into the movie and engage.

Two things of note: watch this movie through all the credits.  You'll be rewarded.  Also, for you K-drama fans out there, wait till you see who has a role in this movie (although he's credited under a slightly different name).  Hint: his character's name begins with a ""Y"".

On the minus side (big time), although I enjoyed this movie immensely, I took off 1 star because the subtitles went by faster than the Roadrunner.  So if you want to enjoy the dialogue as much as the visuals, be prepared to use freeze frame.  A lot.  Very annoying.",1392681600,,706,4.4609375

That seems to have been the genius idea behind ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon,"" the sequel/prequel to the wildly successful ""Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame,"" which didn't really leave itself open for a continuation. This movie deftly skips back a few decades back in time, replacing Andy Lau with the wildly underrated Mark Chao, and serving up another helping of gruesome parasites, monsters and political machinations.

The story takes place about twenty years before the original movie, when a thirty-year-old Dee Renjie (Mark Chao) has arrived in the capital to join the Ministry of Justice. But his first day is a pretty bizarre one -- first he has to rescue a beautiful courtesan, Ruiji (Angelababy), from a gang of thugs, and then he has to rescue her again from a scaled humanoid monster. As the final indignity, his unconventional ways (stealing a Da Lisi badge and a horse) get him arrested by the very stressed-out Yuchi (Feng Shaofeng).

But it doesn't take long for Dee to discover who the humanoid monster really is, and what connection he has to Ruiji -- which raises the question of who kidnapped and transformed him in the first place, and how this ties into the kidnappings. All I can say is that it involves tea, brain surgery, parasites and an obscure islander culture who have a distinct grudge against the ruling dynasty. But one thing is for sure: the only one who can unravel these conspiracies and bizarre occurrences is the incomparable Dee.

Since it takes place before the Empress ruined everyone's life, ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon"" is a somewhat brighter and more optimistic story about Dee Renjie. Sure, it still has magical parasites that can turn you into a scaly hulk, and the Empress is constantly threatening to behead people like a Chinese Red Queen, but this is about the characters at the beginning of their colorful lives of crime-solving and conspiracy-busting. The youthful energy that Dee and Shatuo have is kind of infectious, and it makes the movie feel lighter.

And the story is also somewhat more epic in scope, swirling together a political conspiracy with kidnappings, killer bees, aristocratic tea, a star-crossed romance, and a giant sea monster that is eating up naval vessels like popcorn. It's a pretty complex story with a lot of different details, weaving together tightly so that no part of it ends up being extraneous. For the most part it's a pretty serious political thriller wrapped in wuxia action and lots of sub-mysteries, but director Tsui Hark also includes some bizarrely wacky humor as well (Donkey Wang's bizarre medical experimentation on himself).

And since this is a prequel, most of the roles have been recast with younger actors. For instance, Chao is an excellent choice for the cerebral, lip-reading, possibly asexual hero -- he has the gravity and air of intelligence that work for the character's Sherlockian deductive abilities, but also has some lighter moments that make Dee not seem too perfect (such as his confession that he can't swim). And Lin Gengxin does an excellent job as a younger version of the character Shatuo, a mild-mannered young doctor who finds himself assisting Dee.

The one weak link? Feng Shaofeng as Yuchi, the Da Lisi minister in charge of unraveling the conspiracy. Shaofeng doesn't do a bad job with what he's given, but the character seems to exist entirely to periodically have acrobatic fight scenes.

It's not necessary to have seen the first movie to enjoy ""Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon,"" but it certainly adds a layer of richness to the characters and their interactions. Brighter and more epic in scope, it's a fun ride for anyone who likes action-packed mysteries.",1503014400,,3867,4.938461538461539
8620403,5,B00G3HOLV8,"I loved the Robert van Gulik books, and when I saw these videos for sale I looked up some reviews. People complemented the director so I decided to give them a try. BUT the story was nothing like a van Gulik one, and it was completely stupid. There was nothing but wire-work fight sequences, and CGFX. so boring. I kept falling asleep. Want some entertainment? Read the books, they are not too long at all!",1502841600,,406,4.426666666666667
