2179361,2,B00068YUGQ,"First, this is not a Neon bash.  I love Neon.  I think she has a fun, fluid, unique attitude and style that is contagious!  I do not however, love this DVD.  I own many, and this is not one I chose to workout to.....almost ever.  It is very fast paced, and when checking for alignment or proper technique, she is already way past me and onto something else.  She is such a delight, it is a shame that this video represents her.  It is not her best work.  Give her another chance on something else...you just might love her too, but don't chose this one for your collection.",1134950400,8,573,4.2407407407407405
2179362,1,B00068YUGQ,"I don't like how the video goes straight into the moves, with absolutely no instructions or step-by-step poses. It seems very fast paced, especially if you don't know what you are doing.

If I had the choice, I wouldn't buy it again.",1129680000,6,233,4.5476190476190474
2179363,4,B00068YUGQ,"Work those abs in a different way than ever before! This workout works!  If done consistently it's as good as doing a bizillion crunches but definitely more fun. I use this in combination with another, such as a half hour to 40 min cardio workout in addition to one 15 min segment of this workout. If you haven't had any dance training or aren't familiar with bellydance, this isn't for you (why I took one star off).  I say this mainly because you could easily injure yourself doing the undulations if you aren't familiar with how to move your body in a correct way.  I also love Suhaila's Jazz Fitness Fusion.  This is a lot of fun and a great way to play around with belly dance if you haven't had any dance background. It's also a more complete workout.",1127606400,17,757,4.385714285714286
2179364,5,B00068YUGQ,"I have been bellydancing for about a year now. I have a TON of DVDs and this one by Neon is by far one of my fave! Its detailed, its fun, and before you know it you have worked out for 15 min and it leaves you feeing energized ready for the next workout or for the rest of your day. I love how Neon has given 3-dimensional diagrams so you can understand the body movements, but make sure you have a basic understanding of bellydance because Neon doesn't explain them, but they aren't too hard to figure out but in order to them right get a good book or a good beginner video that explains them so that you can be safe. Also another awesome DVD that is great to workout to or just dance is the Ultimate Bellydance Fitness Workout which features Neon along with a cast of really talented dancers. I loved Body Shaping for Abs & I can't wait to get Body Shaping for Buns & thighs!",1126828800,12,877,4.1345029239766085
2179365,5,B00068YUGQ,"The""Bellydance for Body Shaping"" DVDs ""Abs"" and ""Buns and Thighs"" feature Neon and her signature use of graphic diagrams to show movement direction and depth. Neon is famous for her creative instruction and how differently she approaches creating a video program. Previously I was only familiar only with her ""Instant Bellydancer"" DVDs, but I thought I'd give her new fitness videos a shot, and I wans't disappointed,  I love them! Neon's fitness videos are not aerobic workouts, they are ""target toning"".""Abs"" involves only your torso,""Buns and Thighs"" includes footwork moves. The two most impressive things about these DVDs (aside from the fact that you feel it in the target areas the next day!) are 1- the graphic diagrams 2- the emphasis on technique.  The ""Abs"" diagrams show two areas of movement, ribcage and pelvis. The 2 gray spherical 3D grids represent upper and lower body, while movement directions are shown as yellow circles, arcs and figure 8s. The ""Buns and Thighs"" DVD has diagrams only for the lower body, and they are different. A star indicates glute contraction, and movement directions are depicted as arrows.

During the workout Neon explains how to use glute contraction in many basic, intermediate and a few advanced bellydance moves. For instance, when you perform a hip drop in ""Buns and Thighs"", she instructs you to contract your glutes on the opposite side, and the diagram on the left shows a star (glute contraction) and a downward pointing arrow opposite it.. There are many great technique pointers in both videos. In ""Abs"" the 3D character of the diagrams is very helpful in visualizing the angles at which the pelvis and ribcage tilt toward or away from each other in different directions. Even though these are not instructional vdieos by any measure, even beginners may benefit, the graphics are so helpful. Kudos to Neon for being always ahead in the uncharted territory of bellydance!",1113523200,16,1927,5.053459119496855
2179366,5,B00068YUGQ,"Who this DVD is for:
-a student of belly dance who wants to get more strength and tone in her abs, make her belly dance movements stronger, or wants a great abdominal workout, or
-a follower of the bellydance aerobic fitness trend who wants an intense workout, or
-someone who owns both of Neon's instructional DVD's and is comfortable with the moves taught there, or
-someone with previous dance experience who is good with ""monkey see, monkey do"" style learning

Who this DVD is not for (yet):
-if you want a video to LEARN belly dance
-if you are new to belly dance and don't yet have a grasp of the basic movements.
-if you don't want to get a great abs workout. (No kidding around here!)

Before beginning this workout it's important to keep in mind what it is -- a workout. Although you will practice bellydance, as all of the sections are completely comprised of bellydance moves, don't expect to buy this DVD and have it be your one-stop shopping for instruction and workout. They haven't made anything like that yet. The pacing required for instruction is way too slow to get your heart rate up for a cardiovascular or fat burning workout. Stopping to explain the movements would disrupt the flow of the workout and would keep it from  being nearly as good. In order to work the abdominals, one must drill them without taking breaks for explanation. Neon is an excellent Bellydance instructor but the purpose of this DVD to get your abs in shape, not to learn how to dance.

There is absolutely no bellydance instruction on ""Belly Dance for Body Shaping: Abs."" This workout was designed for someone who already knows bellydance and wants to be lead through a great workout; it's difficulty would be considered at the Intermediate level. The movements are all done quickly in succession leaving no time for instruction. Although instruction is beyond the scope of this video, Neon does give pointers as to what muscles to be contracting for the different movements -- more like good reminders than instruction.

 Andy Troy, a certified strength and conditioning specialist, pops in throughout the workout with helpful, real-time tips for getting the safest and most conformable workout. This is important so you don't strain your knees or lower back.

Two sphere shaped diagrams representing the ribcage and the pelvis are always on the left side of the screen to show how each movement relates to the muscle groups in the area. Although they will help you understand what move you are doing at any given time, they will by no means help explain. A basic knowledge and competency with belly dance are required here. You don't have to be the star attraction at the local Mediterranean restaurant here, you just need to have a basic working knowledge of belly dance.

A progress bar counts the number of moves you have done so far and shows you how many left till the next change. This is helpful for both cueing and motivational purposes.

If you already know what you're doing, bellydance wise, this is as good of a practice session as it is a workout -- excellent overall.",1109462400,132,3081,4.74392523364486
2179367,5,B00068YUGQ,"Neon delivers the best abs workout and I have fun doing it. She is very graceful, perfect cueing, awesome digital effects to show you the moves and whatnot. The exercise is broken down into 3 sequences, followed by a dance sequence/routine with each. You get a cardio workout because she does not stop and talk then move but you can follow her easily because she delivers perfect cueing through oral instruction and the special effects. I think the quality of the DVD is top notch and Neon is mesmerizing...I owned a LOT of bellydance workout and by far this one is the best! (I also purchased the Bellydance Party by Neon and it has the same top notch quality).",1100131200,27,662,4.571428571428571
2179368,4,B00068YUGQ,"Watching Neon dance is truly inspirational. Her moves are fluid, yet powerful and clear. She makes everything look so easy, but it's going to take some practice to get some of her moves and I've been dancing for a long time.
I bought the video to strengthen my ab. I'm sure if I did the routine eveyday my abs would strengthen, but crunches, sit-ups, roll ups would have to be included to come anywhere Neons torso and abs.
I liked the little cartoonish diagrams that went along with the demonstrations. Never seen anything like them. In any event, I'll at least have fun trying.",1216425600,,579,4.576923076923077
2179369,4,B00068YUGQ,"It's a good video, in my opinion. They do tell you what muscles they work, they do tell you what techniques to use when a move is hard, and they do have easy to read drawings to show exactly HOW to move your hips.

It's a perfect video to work out to, especially for someone with an old hip injury like myself who's looking to tone and restore muscle use to a weak hip, and is afraid of putting too much stress on it through traditional exercise.

Unfortunately, the video moves fast for a beginner, and I had to play it a second time through to get it just right. But only a second time! It's not THAT hard to catch up to, once you figure out what you're doing.

Bonus: My 3-year-old son tries to bellydance with me.

Definitely a good buy!",1213574400,,741,4.160839160839161
2179370,1,B00068YUGQ,This is just bad.  Difficult to follow and strange.  Wouldn't buy this again.,1213142400,,77,4.846153846153846
2179371,1,B00068YUGQ,"I have done belly dancing work outs before and they were great, but this one is very hard to follow, she doesn't break the moves down at all...all the way around I have to say one of the worse ones out there.",1209168000,3,208,3.9761904761904763
2179372,5,B00068YUGQ,"This dvd offers 3 15-minute workouts that are great to combine with other routines or freestyle dance for those who already know how to belly dance.  The graphics to the left of the dvd are helpful to the directionally impaired.  The instructor,Neon, has pleasant manner about her in addition to being quite easy to follow.

 It's not geared toward beginners, unlike so many belly dance dvds. I took belly dance lessons regularly for three years but haven't had time with my current work schedule and was getting frustrated with other belly dance workouts that were just too easy. This is perfect.",1198454400,,597,4.881188118811881
2179373,3,B00068YUGQ,"The product was not exactly what I expected.  It was supposed to be instructional, but it moved too fast.  The explaination of what areas were worked was well defined, but the actual steps to do what was being viewed were complicated, and not well explained.",1187827200,3,258,4.711111111111111
2179374,1,B00068YUGQ,"This video is very cheesy.  The way it's shot is kind of annoying.  Also, they just breeze through the moves without any explanation as to how they should be properly executed.",1187136000,4,176,4.645161290322581
2179375,5,B00068YUGQ,"I LOVE this DVD.  I'm new to bellydance (this is my 4th dvd), and as some of the other reviews have said, it is hard for a beginner.  However, if you just watch and practice in front of the mirror again and again, you will get it.  It is a short workout, and can easily be squeezed in at least a few times a week if not every day.  I do the moves taught in the DVD throughout the day as well while I'm cleaning, working, etc...always concentrating on working the ab muscles.

I love this video because I've never been able to do sit-ups, crunches,  etc because of neck problems and this workout works your abs just as well and it's fun!  It's really worked for me...I bought a bikini again this year, but this year I'll actually wear it!

Just a tip: the dances are not broken down, so what I did is watched them slowly, pausing when necessary, and jotted down the illustrations on paper.  Then I went through the dance without the DVD using my notes, and now I can do them with Neon.",1181174400,3,984,4.191489361702128
2179376,5,B00068YUGQ,"It is extremely good to get those amazing abs with belly dance movements, but make no mistake, this DVD IS NOT for beginners. There are many moves she is taken for granted you already know like hip drops and lifts, pivoting and horse riding. She is not explaining how to make those, she just explains the moves that involves the abs, meaning the ondulations. You must have some previous knowledge on belly dance, and even then it is challenging. The abs work is hard and the perfect abs are logically guaranteed if you do things right. I think the idea of the fitness consultant explaining and giving indications along the exercise is very good, he tells you the do's and dont's and at the beginning he goes trhough an explanation of each and every abdominal muscle and when it works. So I basically recommend it as a must, but for intermediate and advanced belly dancers. DEFINITIVELY  NOT for beginners/ novices, and not with the intent to learn to dance from it. You probably won't like it either if you need several repetions in slow and normal motion. The most repetition you will have here is 8, which at normal speed, is still few sometimes. If you are seeking for technique for all ondulations, then by all means go for it, as well. I think it is worth the price but only if the buyer HAS VERY CLEAR the right intent and goal of this DVD.

For those who are not native english speaking, you may find Andy Troy talks very fast for one to understand what he says sometimes, but it's still worth to try.",1179100800,3,1508,4.48
2179377,3,B00068YUGQ,"This was not the best belly dancing performance I have every seen.  She was too green during the whole demostration.  The only part of the cd was the graphic pictures as to what part the belly dancing moves does to certain parts of the body.  She bent over to much for me.  If I did what she was doing I would have broke my back.  It was okay, but I would not recommend this cd to anyone.",1173312000,3,388,3.987012987012987
2179378,3,B00068YUGQ,"I'm a somewhat experienced belly dancer, and I was looking for something a little different and faster paced, and this video definitely fits the bill.

If you have never belly danced before then this DVD is not for you, but if you want something challenging that varies from the average belly dance workout video, then I recommend this video.",1169424000,7,342,4.796610169491525
2179379,3,B00068YUGQ,"This video has great moves, but if you are looking for step-by-step instruction then this video isn't what you want. You are shown the move once, then the instructor goes into the routine. It was too fast paced for a beginner.",1163030400,10,226,4.536585365853658
2179380,2,B00068YUGQ,The actual workout seems fine however if you have never done bellydancing before this DVD is not for you. The instructor moves too quickly to the next step before you have a chance to grasp the move.  I threw out my back trying to keep up with this one!,1155427200,13,253,4.163265306122449
2179381,5,B00068YUGQ,This is a very good instructional DVD. Neon makes learning these techniques easy and and fun. But I'd like to know if that Andy guy ever puts his arms down.,1154563200,6,156,4.233333333333333
2179382,1,B00068YUGQ,"I bought this DVD with the thought that at first they might break down the moves BEFORE they just jump right into the deep end of the pool.  Personally, for someone who has never done bellydancing ever before, this was a horrible buy.  I didn't like the way they had the set up either, seemed dark, and they just jumped straight into the moves, telling you how to move your body as they were doing it and going onto the next one.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1147219200,16,467,4.284090909090909
2179383,5,B00068YUGQ,"Everyone wrote great reviews that I agree with. This is for people who already know bellydance or own several dvds that teach the basics first since there is none here.
Neon is VERY fluid & there are great dances on here & moves that are beautiful. You never get any rest & you get a short warmup, workout that develops into a dance & cooldown all in 15 min. in three separate sessions. There is music playing the whole time which does not in her Dance Party DVD that has the same look.

There are clips of other DVDs at the distributer's site at worlddancenewyork com",1144454400,11,568,4.3584905660377355

I really like how each workout session build upon the next.  I recommend mastering the first session to go on to the next and so forth. This dvd is fun and will keep your interest even though you are exercising. These moves can also be use on the dance floor. Within weeks you will see a difference, I surely did.",1142294400,6,474,4.511627906976744
2179385,5,B00068YUGQ,This video is pretty easy to follow.  I enjoy it a lot because the dancer is shown from the front and back at the same time. THis makes it much easier to learn and understand how the move is suposed to be perfomed.  The photo quality itself is a little low but the information that the DVD gives you is worth the purchase.,1141862400,9,322,4.095238095238095
2179386,3,B00068YUGQ,"This DVD is not for you, if you havn't done belly dancing before... It still provides a good workout, but watch it a couple of times before attempting it yourself.",1140912000,4,163,4.466666666666667
2179387,5,B00068YUGQ,"This dvd works for me! I I was very impressed with ""Belly dance for Bodyshaping"" because it shows all the many different ways belly dance uses your abs and hips. I believe there are things about how our body works that only dance can teach us, and this video has abouut a million moves that you do that happen between your neck and your hips.  It's a serious fitness video. There are some explanations of the moves, but not like in a real instructional. If you've never done bellydance, you need to be fast and a good mover to pick it up. I also bought Neon's ""Instant Belly dancer"" that teaches the same moves used in the workout.  You will have no problem following this workout if you know how to use your hips, like maybe you know Latin dance or a little bellydance. If you don't, I recommend ""Instant Belly dancer"" dvds to teach you all the steps you do in the bodyshaping video.",1140220800,,884,4.351515151515152

8040670,4,B00068YUGQ,"Not that the title states that it is for beginners, but I really want to stress this fact. I have been taking belly dance since 2010 and am currently the teaching assistant in the level 1 and 2 classes. While I think this is a great video, it definitely helps to have a working knowledge of what she is doing. If one were to try to do this without having taken any classes before it would be very difficult to follow along.
The diagrams on the side are a good idea, but not very well executed.

The trainer who pops up every once in a while is semi annoying. (Why does he have his fists balled up? He looks like he is bracing for a fight.) However, it is a good idea to have someone there reminding you to keep good form as Neon does not do that. And much of the advice he gives is good.

Other than that, the only other thing I must really caution you about in this video is in the beginning when she is warming up, she stretches out her thighs by doing a sort of modified Warrior pose. She is really hyper-extending her knee! I have no doubt that she is very flexible, but extending your knees past your feet (while lunging) can do a lot of damage.

I highly recommend watching the video in it's entirety before attempting any of these moves. Also remember that Neon is a professional and has been doing this for years. You may not be as flexible as she is so you should not attempt back bending as deeply as she does.",1341446400,,1420,4.156363636363636
8040671,5,B00068YUGQ,"Yes, it is a belly dance workout ... three complete belly dance workouts for abs, to be specific. And there were some great music tracks. Each session has a warm-up, workout, dance, and cool-down. This is definitely not for beginners. Neon just jumps right into the moves without explaining them. A one point (session three), she even incorporated a shimmy without even saying anything about it or giving even one verbal cue. This is a challenging program for people who are already familiar with belly dance. Neon's moves are easy to see and she definitely does give you a workout for your abs in each session. There are some helpful tips offered by Andy Troy on how to get the most out of the workout safely. At the end of each session there were funny ""comments"" from him ... like, ""More fun than crunches. Especially to watch.""

Belly dance is so much more fun than a traditional workout! It's actually dance.

Don't be turned off by the cover of this DVD, which really needs to show Neon on a  white background and wearing what she wears in the DVD. The DVD itself is worth having. It's a great workout program for people who love belly dance.",1335225600,,1148,4.563106796116505

8040673,3,B00068YUGQ,"I agree that most beginners would be frustrated with this video.  I have taken quite a few classes and have purchased a few DVDs and found it to be a challenge.  It is not my favorite video but it isn't horrible dance move wise.

Pros
-It does do a number on your abs once you get the moves and techniques down properly
-The guy (however weird and awkwardly he appears in the corner of the video) helps with executing the moves properly

Cons
-It took me awhile to catch the hang of the moves and the dance sequences
-If you were not properly taught how to protect your low back while dancing you could easily hurt yourself attempting some of the moves
-She moves a little fast in the sessions so it takes practice and repetitions to nail the entire routine
-Seems like a very low budget video

Get this DVD if you 1) Want a bit of a challenge to work your abs 2) Don't give up easily 3) Know the proper posture for belly dancing.  Seasoned dancers should not have too much difficulty.",1309392000,2,985,4.297297297297297
