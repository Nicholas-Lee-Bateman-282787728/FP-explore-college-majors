4332650,5,B004DKDOEC,"This 1951 B&W movie is not very well known, but once you watch it, you may become addicted to it! The story is fascinating, and so is the acting by master actors and actresses like Joseph Cotton, Louis Calhern, Barbara Stanwyck, and the magic French girl with the gorgeous eyes Leslie Caron (you may remember LILI, the 1953 masterpiece, and the musical GIGI from 1958). This is a mystery set in 19th-century New York, with international overtones! I enjoy it every time!",1398556800,3,470,4.7439024390243905
4332651,5,B004DKDOEC,"This was a very good movie.  Joseph Cotton happens to be one of my favorite actors and as usual, he gives a great performance.  I thought the ending was great.  I always try to figure the outcome of a mystery and although I thought I had it, I was still surprised.",1389657600,2,264,4.137254901960785
4332652,5,B004DKDOEC,"Great acting, story and surprise ending!  What more could you want from a film!  A must see for movie buffs!",1367884800,,108,4.35
4332653,1,B004DKDOEC,I originally bought this DVD for Barbara Stanwyck but she even couldn't pull it off for me; sold it before I finished seeing it,1364256000,,127,4.333333333333333
4332654,5,B004DKDOEC,THE MAN WITH THE CLOAK.  INTERESTING ENDING!!! BE SURE TO WATCH IT. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH COTTEN AND STANWYCK!!,1354492800,,113,4.65
4332655,5,B004DKDOEC,"I took a chance on this movie based on the name of the film (intriguing), the caliber of actors, Joseph Cotten, Barbara Stanwyck, Leslie Caron and the Amazon reviews. I LOVED THIS MOVIE! The period setting of Boston MA was superbly done. The performances of all, including bit players were perfect. The build-up of suspense was nerve tingling and the fight scene at the end was so frighteningly realistic I found myself yelling outloud in fright. The final scene was just the cherry on the top for me, I hadn't a clue that was coming. Loved This.....!",1352073600,,551,4.690721649484536
4332656,4,B004DKDOEC,"A minor film in MGM's mystery canon to be sure, but THE MAN WITH A CLOAK (based on the John Dickson Carr story) will, I hope, get some much-needed recognition thanks to this new Warner Archive release (especially from fans of Leslie Caron and Barbara Stanwyck).

Following up her acclaimed film debut in ""An American in Paris"", Leslie Caron is Madeline Minot, a young Parisian who journeys to little old New York in order to visit her fianc's grandfather, a certain Mr. Charles Theverner (Louis Calhern).  Theverner lives in a mansion with three duplicitous servants, headed by housekeeper Lorna Bounty (Barbara Stanwyck).  Certain that Theverner's life is in danger, Madeline appeals to a cloaked stranger (Joseph Cotten), in trying to get to the bottom of the mystery.  Madeline's fianc, caught up in the French Revolution, needs funds desperately, but so do Lorna and her accomplices.  Just exactly who can Madeline trust in this gaslit game of cat-and-mouse?

This highly odd period thriller from 1951 is definitely ""B"" territory, but the art direction is typical classy MGM all the way.  Barbara Stanwyck plays her usual dastardly femme fatale, this time in period clothes; Leslie Caron perfectly contrasts as the waif in her trap.  Joseph Cotten oozes charm and heroism as the cloaked character of the title.  There's an eye-opening twist ending, and David Raksin's score is very pretty.

The print on this DVD-R from the Warner Archive is basic but watchable.  It doesn't look to have undergone a restoration (there's a considerable amount of speckle and debris in the image).  There are no extras, and as per most of the other Warner Archive titles, you may only proceed through the movie in ten-minute increments.",1298419200,14,1722,5.045936395759718
4332657,5,B004DKDOEC,"A fantastic classic from the real writer of 'Out of the Past', with a superb cast and atmosphere, and dialogue to linger over.  Leslie Caron comes to old New York from Paris to get money for her revolutionary lover from his crusty uncle living in exile and stumbles into a murder mystery, as well as the dashing and elusive Joseph Cotton.",1292284800,10,338,4.540983606557377
8425501,5,B004DKDOEC,"The unexpected, eye-popping, last 15 seconds of the film put a huge smiling WOW! on my face and forced me to grant it five generous stars. Also, the crisp, poetic dialogue (I promise, you'll hang on every word uttered by Joseph Cotten) adds a brilliant luster to ""The Man With A Cloak.""

Stanwyck is slightly understated as a femme fatale, yet effective enough to likely remind you of her role as the cold-blooded Phyllis Dietrichson from ""Double Indemnity."" Leslie Caron -- a cloying, gets-on-your-nerves sort of actress whom I could never abide -- is the only fly in the ointment.

Anyone heartless enough to disclose the ending of ""Cloak"" should spend the next ten years of his or her life behind bars.",1489968000,,705,4.770491803278689
8425502,5,B004DKDOEC,"Unplugged from satellite tv a year ago and mainly watch dvds.
My main interest in movies are the kind TCM shows so I decided to give this a try as I don't remember ever seeing it on TCM
I love to watch great,legendary actors like Barbara Stanwyck  and being able to see her in a film with the handsome, talented but underappreciated Joseph Cotten  led me to take a chance on The Man With A Cloak.
This film is engrossing and has a nice surprise of a twist at the end!",1458518400,,467,4.1208791208791204
8425503,4,B004DKDOEC,"A curious item, this one. Mysterious, gloomy, and on the arty side, Man With a Colak is a surprising entry from the usually staid and wholesome MGM. I don't know if Id rate this one a forgotten classic, but it does have its attractions. It might be described as a Gothic noir with a large helping of Poe references. As befits the subject matter, Man with a Cloak is a very writerly movie and accordingly has a wise, witty script which includes a bevy of quips that would do Oscar Wilde proud.
The film is also noteworthy for its offbeat casting: Louis Calhern as a well-to-do, alcoholic patriarch at deaths door; Leslie Caron as a waif in distress; Joe De Sanits as a thuggish butler; Joseph Cotten as the mystery man who describes himself as Mr. Dupin, who serves as our story's sleuth; Jim Backus as a crusty bar manager; and most of all Barbara Stanwyck, semi-cast against type as the housekeeper from Hell who makes Rebecca's Mrs. Danvers seem like Miss Congeniality.",1449964800,,971,4.618497109826589
8425504,5,B004DKDOEC,Great. A certain morose literary genius solves a mystery. Stanwyck and Cotten are fascinating in their scenes together.,1443916800,,119,5.666666666666667
8425505,5,B004DKDOEC,wonderful,1429056000,,9,9.0
8425506,3,B004DKDOEC,"It's mediocre. Barbara Stanwyck isn't the lady in distress, Joseph Cotton is the man with a cloak. The best thing about the movie is the end, finding out who the man in the cloak is.",1428796800,,182,4.228571428571429
8425507,4,B004DKDOEC,"Interesting movie for it's time.  Can you figure out before the end of the movie who ""The Man With A Cloak"" is?  I had.  If you want to see a well acted and good type of murder mystery, I would say you will like this and watch it.",1416182400,,230,3.75
8425508,5,B004DKDOEC,"Simply a delightful movie.  I'm a huge fan of Joseph Cotten, and his performance is spectacular.  The dialogue throughout the movie is crisp and is delivered with perfect timing and effect.  Highly recommended little film.",1413158400,,222,5.285714285714286
8425509,5,B004DKDOEC,Great old movie with a twist at the end.,1412553600,,40,3.5555555555555554
8425510,4,B004DKDOEC,It was a good mystery that kept you guessing if you were watching historical fact or just intriguing fiction. I always enjoy seeing Joseph Cotton and Barbara Stanwyck.,1412208000,,167,5.0
