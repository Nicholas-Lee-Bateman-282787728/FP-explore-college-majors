4659895,5,B005DHO6XW,"A documentary that took me on a journey.  By the time it ended, I felt emotionally moved, and it was tough for me to come back to earth.  Well made, very relatable.  I highly recommend this movie.",1414800000,2,196,4.243243243243243
4659896,5,B005DHO6XW,"My wife and I are planning on doing some military hops, and eventually retiring in Thailand or some place similar. We regularly watch travel videos, travel tip videos and location videos. None of them made it real like this movie.

This movie gets at the real stages and mindsets that an extended traveler will experience. I truly believe that watching this movie will help prepare someone who is considering extended travel. We were very against hostels but after watching this movie we have come to realize that if we want to stay out there as long as possible hotels will quickly eat up the budget and bring an end to the adventure, so we will have to bend on that and consider hostels.

I agree with the reviewers who said this movie is very re-watchable. If you are on the fence about this one you won't regret buying it.",1404086400,4,826,4.5369127516778525
4659897,5,B005DHO6XW,"This is must for the Vagabond at Heart. Gypsies had it right traveling form place to place.
The world might be a better place if humans travelled to see that people are the same no matter where
in the world you go to, rather then the evening news.",1358553600,4,247,4.166666666666667
4659898,5,B005DHO6XW,"I've really come to love this film and I just wish it was easier to share with others. Brook, please get this on streaming services like Amazon and Netflix Instant. It really helps to expand the audience for a documentary.

Have you ever known anyone to go traveling for months at a time to remote places of the world? A couple people I went to high school with do this on a regular basis and I always thought they were crazy. They work for a few months, then just up and leave for months on end. I never would have considered doing it myself until I saw this film. If I don't chicken out, there may now be a trip like this in my future.

The narrator Brook leads us on a trip through the fascinating backpacking culture, centered around cheap long term travel. Along the way we get to know some very interesting people, and we come to learn why they decided to travel this way. Some of them giving up careers to do this, much like the narrator himself. We even meet a retired senior spending his golden years traveling the world. These people and their stories really come to enrich this documentary. Brook does an excellent job telling both his and their stories and it really draws the viewer in.

The film makes some observations about our culture and the things we value. How we often chase material possessions and status symbols, and even our vacations become symbols of status and prestige. However, many come to realize that these things don't make us happy and money is much better spent on experiences that will stay with you forever.

Regardless of whether or not you choose to buy into this point of view, this film takes you along on this journey and you feel as if you are there experiencing it with him. The replay value of this is high, and I pop it in my DVD player on a regular basis, whenever I feel like I need a mini vacation. I cannot recommend this film enough and I guarantee you will enjoy it.",1355270400,9,1919,4.382022471910112
4659899,5,B005DHO6XW,This is an excellent watch for anyone considering a career break or with wanderlust.  It reminded me of how great it is to be on the road.  Good perspective on the ups and downs of travel.,1336003200,4,188,4.194444444444445
4659900,4,B005DHO6XW,"Like other the sole reviewer, I also enjoyed this film. Maybe these are not my experiences while travelling, but more power to Brook for painstakingly recording, editing and producing his video memoirs.

I probably would not flock to Brook should I have met him in a hostel, but he seems a nice enough, warm guy - I think he comes off as a little on the co-dependent side, despite his claims of being otherwise. He certainly did a lovely job with this film, and the characters that he interviews are particularly what caught my interest & kept me watching. I definitely enjoyed the 70 something American, as well as the German banker's stories. And there are of course the eye rolling moments - ""after 2 hours, I had a new girlfriend"" & ""I never go anywhere without my Canadian flag patch"" people...ugh.

Overall, this is a nice little film to enjoy. It would be nice to see in some hostel's dvd library while on travels.",1333929600,,921,4.575757575757576
4659901,5,B005DHO6XW,"The narrator in this movie, Brook, is kind of strange. He makes up expressions regarding traveling and over-exaggerates his love life. The movie is an attempt to glorify his mediocre, New York existence.

On a positive note, there are some interesting people like Ed from Thailand and the strange American girl who pretends to be Canadian. Overall, I enjoyed the film the 32 times I watched it =)",1320710400,2,396,4.823529411764706

4659909,4,B005DHO6XW,It's interesting but not the backpacker movie I was looking for. Not about hiking more about relationships some interesting thoughts on how to travel and difference between american and European ways of travel. It's a little dated also.,1453680000,2,236,5.2368421052631575
4659910,3,B005DHO6XW,"This is an ok film, which might be of interest to an unseasoned traveler considering such a trip.  The protagonist's journey is nothing remarkable--he visits the most popular of places on the backpacker's circuit; tries his hand at journalistic commentary despite obvious cultural naivete; and for the most part, hangs out with other travelers doing little other than eating cheap lunches, riding rickshaws, and taking snapshots on the beach--indeed, as it says, like a string of lazy saturdays spent schlepping a pack to various gringo outposts around the globe.",1452902400,2,563,5.325842696629214

4659917,5,B005DHO6XW,"This was a great film and made me remember many of the places around the world that I've been too.  It also made me want to go traveling again to some other interesting locations and hang out with the great people you meet on the road.  This documentary also dealt with the short term friendships that are fun that you make when visiting foreign countries.

If he ever decides to make a sequel, I want to be in it.  :)",1427932800,,418,4.1875
4659918,5,B005DHO6XW,"Great documentary of what it's really like to travel. The subject goes into depth about all the major aspects of being on the road for so long; the good, the bad, the interesting. Great watch.",1427155200,,192,4.514285714285714
4659919,5,B005DHO6XW,"Really good film, would highly recommended to anyone who wants to travel and live
I saw this shortly after studying abroad in England and since then I fell in love with Traveling
Really on point about the pros and cons of solo travel (it sucks to make good friends overseas and never see them again...)

if you've been wanting to travel and want to see what to expect, then this film is right for you.",1426291200,,401,4.346666666666667
4659920,5,B005DHO6XW,Fantastic! Really worth a watch. This film has answered so many questions I have about travel and going solo and gives an inspiring and personal insight into the subject.,1421107200,,170,4.896551724137931
8466811,5,B005DHO6XW,"It's a self-made documentary about a guy who solo-traveled the world for nearly a year.  It's not a perfect film, but I recommend it WHOLEHEARTEDLY to anyone who's ever solo-traveled, but even more so to anyone who's ever dreamt or thought about or considered a period of extended travel.  Watch the film, then DO IT!

I went abroad for 6 months at age 24, leaving behind a white-shirt job in Manhattan as he did. I traveled alone through 16 countries (a small number compared to many in the film, but still life-changing for me).  My trip ended up morphing into a 3-year stint of living abroad.  I had an amazing transition from ""I could never do that,"" to ""I really want to do that"", to ""Wow, I'm doing this, all on my own!"" to ""I can never explain to anyone what it was like to have done that.""

This film came as close to anything I've seen or read to explaining what it was like.

In my experience, extended solo travel changed the way I viewed the world, it changed the way I viewed my own country, it changed the way I live my life, and above all it changed me.  It's impossible to explain, really, to anyone who hasn't experienced it, but if you make it through this film and you find yourself going, ""Wow!"", then it's a life-changing experience you might want to seriously have for yourself - no matter what your age (see one character in the film, who was over 70...)",1526342400,,1377,4.372549019607843

8466815,1,B005DHO6XW,". This dog needs a trailer t help screen it. It's not even travel 101, remedial travel at best... told through an unending barrage of travel small talk from 50 different people. Exhausting without learning anything or being entertained",1501891200,,235,5.051282051282051
8466816,4,B005DHO6XW,"I've just finished watching this, and I'm a little afraid if I don't write a review now I might not get round to doing so. It's worth championing  it's an interesting and worthwhile watch. For anyone who's been bitten by the travel bug  by the backpacking bug  it'll bring back fond memories. And remind you to get on the road again. The people Silva-Braga meets are articulate and friendly, and the film captures how enriching travelling can be.",1496188800,,446,4.6923076923076925

8466818,4,B005DHO6XW,"really well done. I have years of memories that include travel throughout the US, Japan, Italy and more. The desert of Baja, open range in Montana and the amazing streets of Rome, London and Tokyo all make for a richer, more intense life than i've ever seen living in one place. This film puts many of the experiences into view and this guy has much to say about the lifestyle that makes sense.",1481414400,,394,4.410958904109589
