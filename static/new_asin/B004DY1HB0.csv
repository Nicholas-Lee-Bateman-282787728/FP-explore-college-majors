8426260,5,B004DY1HB0,"After Ann realizes his husband cheats her, she decides to clean her life, making what one might denominate a total cut, to begin again since zero. She abandons her succesful caree as piano concertist, sells her comfortable apartment, looking for a place to hide herself from the crowd.

The exquisite and always talented Isabelle Huppert headlines this  passionate tale, adapted from a novel by belletrist Pascal Quignard (All the Mornings of the World). Guided by her musical intuition and the emotional support of a male friend, Georges (Jean-Hugues Anglade), Ann suddenly realizes how necessary it is for her to latch onto a new identity. She thus embarks on a transnational journey that ultimately takes her to the island of Ischia, Italy, and a palatial house called the Villa Amalia that will change her life.

As the time goes by, she realizes the loneliness will be its eternal partner while the other people is just another piece in her messy existence. Deception, disaffection and the search of peace far from the madding world.

Jacques Benoit makes a minimalist description (with a marked style that seems borrowed from Michelangelo Antonioni) about this feeling of unberable loneliness without abusing of unnecessary dialogues, the images are by themselves extremely eloquent and talk by themselves. Arresting landscapes and a first rate cast compete this little filmic gem.

Don't let it pass. It will reward you.",1299196800,4,1427,5.1869565217391305
