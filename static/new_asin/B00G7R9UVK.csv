8621324,2,B00G7R9UVK,"I was unable to buy the English version and I assumed that by buying the Spanish language version it might have a language selection field. Sadly it did not. It also seems the subtitles are in Spanish. Why have Spanish dialogue with Spanish sub titles??????

Thank goodness for friends who speak Spanish!  My original comment about language selection was incorrect. I was directed to go and look a little deeper and thus I found the section for language selection and selected the appropriate item. Now watching the movie and hearing it in English. Note for the future, check before comment. And now..... enjoy!!!",1430956800,,613,4.941747572815534
