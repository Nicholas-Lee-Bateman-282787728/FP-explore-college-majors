8707498,3,B00UMQDD2O,I can't listen to it because it is in German.  I did watch it and was glad to see Giger in his home setting.  But it is kinda sad to see how old and seemingly helpless he was when they filmed this.,1435104000,,197,3.6666666666666665
8707499,4,B00UMQDD2O,"I saw this in the theatre over the weekend.  This is not a movie that really goes into Giger the artist or Giger the celebrity so much as Giger the human being.  Much of the movie is shot in his home, with him in houseclothes (pajamas?) and there are many brief interviews with him, his wife, inlaw, former spouse and partner, close friends and associates.  You may be expecting him to be cold and aloof, but he come across as an eccentric, kindly elder.  Some people may find the pace slow, it does drag in parts, but the director does a good job making you feel like you are there, exploring his house and rummaging through his life.  The first living being featured in the film is Giger's cat, Mggi III, who is very prominent throughout the film.  Rather than lingering too much on popular topics such as his involvement and Oscar for Alien, or the various works he creates for album art, there is more focus on who he is, and where he comes from.  We see a childhood home in the Alps, the drugstore his father ran, and video and photographs from the 60's and 70's.  There is also a bit about Li Tobler, and he holds back tears while talking about her.  This movie was created shortly before his death, and there certainly is a sense throughout the movie that this is his last statement.",1431907200,3,1290,4.38655462184874
