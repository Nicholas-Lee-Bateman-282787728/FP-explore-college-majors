2756086,4,B000N4SA8M,"Like stuffing spinach in a candy bar, ""Dinosaurs"" sneaks political and social issues into a kid-friendly sitcom. Though its characters are cartoonish dinosaurs who dress, act and speak just like typical early-'90s sitcom stars, the show often focuses on social issues like the environment, race, religion, television and the role of women. The stories center on the Sinclair family -- blue-collar dad Earl, sensible mom Fran, rebellious son Robbie, shopoholic daughter Charlene, smart-aleck infant Baby and dimwitted neighbor Roy. Set 60 million years ago, ""Dinosaurs"" has lots of good gags. The calendars run backward, though no one questions what they are counting down to. When humans appear, the dinosaurs can never tell the males from the females.

But it's not for everyone. The pacing can drag, not everyone will agree with the show's progressive point of view and, unlike the puppet faces in other Henson Co. projects, these hard-plastic versions make it tough to care about the characters. Still, many kids will love the kooky vibe, and the show does have its moments. When Earl gets into a fist-fight with kid's TV character Georgie the Hippo (a veil-thin version of Barney the Dinosaur), Roy entertains the stunned onlookers -- all children -- with an impromptu version of the 1970s Commodores hit, ""Brick House.""

If you buy this set, the easiest way to enjoy it is to cherry-pick the episodes you watch. The better ones include:

""BABY TALK"" (about profanity)
""NETWORK GENIUS"" (TV programming)
""THE SON ALSO RISES"" (role reversal)
""THE GREATEST STORY EVER SOLD"" (religion)
""GETTING TO KNOW YOU"" (cultural diversity)
""HONEY I MISS THE KIDS"" (working moms)
""EARL DON'T BE A HERO"" (commercialism)
""VARIATIONS ON A THEME PARK"" (Disney theme parks)
""GEORGIE MUST DIE"" (Barney the dinosaur)
""CHANGING NATURE"" (extinction)

Bonus features include an insightful audio commentary (for the episode ""Nature Calls""); a 9-minute discussion of the show's political messages and a 6-minute short on the design and personality of Baby (Kevin Clash, who also portrays Elmo on ""Sesame Street"").

By the way, if you're headed to Walt Disney World you can see some of the show's props in person. They're in the walk-through Prop Storage Room of the Backlot Tour at Disney's Hollywood Studios. The ""Dinosaurs"" refrigerator is down the first row on the right.",1178496000,13,2350,5.222811671087533
2756087,5,B000N4SA8M,"In my opinion, the final episode of ""Dinosaurs"", entitled ""Changing Nature"", is the best final episode of ANY series ever shown on television. It gives its own comedic and touching version of why the Dinosaurs became extinct, and it has an obvious relevance to the current environmental situation. Unfortunately, it appears as if the episodes are presented on the DVD not in production order, but in release order. In other words, there are several originally unaired episodes which are presented on the disc after ""Changing Nature"". If you buy this set, which I heartily recommend, do yourself a favor and watch ""Changing Nature"" last.",1175990400,50,636,5.125
2756088,5,B000N4SA8M,i forgot how funny this series was until i bought the DVD set.  it is a must have for any collection.  the wit and humour are above average which makes for great viewing.  not like the canned sit coms that are out there today.,1174694400,6,226,4.090909090909091

I think some stores may be able to order it for you but I am not sure! Anyway this set is so good and Dinosaurs is such a great comedy family film, I am an adult and have loved these shows since I was a kid. I am very happy that these sets are allready available online.",1173830400,5,471,3.865979381443299
2756090,5,B000N4SA8M,"This is a great show for kids and adults alike. I watched it growing up and even recorded a few episodes on the old VHS, ah!

This should entail 22 episodes from Season 3, and 14 episodes from Season 4.  36 episodes on 4 discs sounds about right!  (I've already preordered mine!)

2756096,5,B000N4SA8M,"This 4-disc set contains the last two seasons of the show, which was a lot of fun and very funny. A couple of things to note. The first set, containing the first two seasons, contained some additional features, including a trivia note that the first five episodes were produced with and without a laugh track. As the producers realized, the laugh track was unnecessary and so none of the episodes include a laugh track. It simply is not needed, the writing and performances were so good, that the show stands on its own.",1520121600,2,520,4.602150537634409

2756098,5,B000N4SA8M,I used to love this show when it was on years ago.  I thought about it again a few years ago and checked to see if it was on my on-demand cable feature--not there.  I don't know why I never thought of checkng if there was a DVD set I could buy until a friend mentioned she had the set (actually two sets).  I bought both.  I love watching it as much as I did when the new shows were on TV.,1519689600,,389,3.707317073170732

2756104,5,B000N4SA8M,This entire series is just the best. I remember watching it when I was younger. Recently I got the urge to see if I could find it on here so I could relive that part of my childhood. It was a FANTASTIC decision! The show is even funnier now that I understand what they are talking about and it's pretty crude! I love it!,1516838400,,320,4.015625

2756110,5,B000N4SA8M,Ilived the Dinosaurs show when it was on television and bought it so my five year old great nephew could enjoy it. It did not disappoint!!,1512259200,,138,4.346153846153846
2756111,5,B000N4SA8M,"Wow, I'd forgotten just how hilarious this show truly was during the original run way back when. The story lines are truly timeless in my opinion, which makes them even funnier today. We're having a really hard time NOT binge watching the entire series... we're trying to save them and only watch an episode or two per day, but it isn't easy once you start a disc!

This show had to be a nightmare to pull off, considering there are 2 to 3 different acting credits per character. It takes a lot, with all the costuming, voice work, and mechanical aspects involved to truly bring these creatures to life.

You gotta love it!!! Even if you're not da mama!
Very well done young Henson, very well done indeed.

Packaging wise, this is very high quality. No paper sleeves to scratch the dvd's, or inconvienient stacked spindles here... its individuals that hold each disc securely to itself and keep it protected.",1511481600,3,908,4.6625

2756137,5,B000N4SA8M,"I enjoyed this series when it was on TV and I've owned the Season 1 & 2 DVD set for several years. I recently discovered on Wikipedia that there were 7 ""Lost"" episodes made which were not broadcast by ABC. The regular series broadcast ended with episode 58 ""Changing Nature.""  The 7 lost episodes were later shown in syndication. I am excited to report that all 7 lost episodes are included in this Season 3 & 4 set!

While the series has a certain dated ""All in the Family"" vibe, it is fun to watch and the puppetry work is exceptional. While attending film school in the 1980's I crewed on a TV pilot for a similar show featuring Dragon puppets. Like Dinosaurs, each of the dragon puppets was operated by two puppeteers. It was very technically challenging to videotape each scene, with numerous retakes due to glitches in the puppets. With that reference experience I am super impressed by the natural movements of these characters. No surprise, the Henson people are clearly the best in the world at this kind of work.",1497571200,8,1022,4.579234972677596

2756298,5,B000N4SA8M,"I also grew up watching this with my family. 18 years later (I'm 22 now and I think we watched it when I was around four years old), I'm still watching it and loving it. Was one of my favorite things on TV when I was small (next to Barney, which was #1 at the time for me) because I was an austist obsessed with dinosaurs. Really awesome sitcom from the Jim Henson studio. I hear it even had a Disney World parade. Too bad I was too little to go when they had it- I would have loved that. (When they had it, it was closer to the year I was born and my family doesn't believe in bringing kids to Disney before they're at least maybe three years old so they can remember the trip too.)

I remember my dad once handed me a frying pan and asked me what it was for. I think I told him the straight forward answer, but I do remember also swinging it a little and saying ""Not the mama!"". I also remember my kindergarten teacher brought me one of the best Christmas gifts ever at our school's Christmas party in class... It was a little action figure type toy of Baby Sinclair. My mom says I didn't put that thing down for days.

Whether or not you have kids, this is a great show for everyone to tune into. It's hilarious and for those who are more inclined to visual arts... It's not that hard to not be tempted to admire the work that went into the sets, costumes and puppets. However, there is a small warning for families with high-functioning autistic children who may love this. The final episode has everyone die, although it doesn't show it. The final episode is the beginning of the ""apocalypse"" for the dinosaurs, kinda. Admittedly, even for me, being 22, that was difficult to watch. (Thank god I never saw the final episode as a child. It would have affected me.)

But in conclusion, all the way up until the final moments, the show really keeps the laughter flowing. Not only that, if you find the kids glued to the screen, there are also highly educational episodes against certain issues like drugs or for things like how to take care of the environment. None of which fall short of the quality level of the other episodes.",1429920000,,2131,4.296019900497512

The humor is sharp and engaging, and it's a good, clean family show. Not that ""family show"" is a major priority for my household, but it's definitely child friendly and good for starting conversations on everything from personal responsibility to social justice.

My favorite running gag is conversing with their food. YMMV.",1394496000,,457,5.260273972602739

I was very disappointed however when receiving this and playing the discs. The audio quality was not very good at all. It is very very difficult to understand the dialogue of the characters in this show. I gave it as a gift to my daughter, so by the time she opened it on her birthday and we played it, it was too late for Amazon.com to refund or credit me anything.

There are some great lines and ideas sprinkled in all the episodes. It reminds me of All in the Family plus the Cosby Show. Children will love it for the visual and what they are familiar with. But this is more than a kids series. It is the adults who will get the real deeper social discussions. And because it is dinosaurs making the comments, it is much harder to be offended.",1390521600,,545,4.405940594059406

2756435,5,B000N4SA8M,"I have run into few people who are familiar with this vastly under-appreciated television series, but clearly those who have seen it have recognized its unique genius. Once the viewer gets accustomed to actors wearing dinosaur costumes, the facial movements of which are operated remotely by skilled puppeteers, it becomes apparent that this is a brilliant version of a standard sit-com format: somewhat buffoonish, long-suffering everyman father (Earl), somewhat more astute wife/mother (Fran), rebellious teenage Son (Robbie),clueless, materialistic daughter (Charlene) and somewhat malevolent but entertaining Baby. The stunning originality of this series rests on three very strong foundations: the writers, who have built in some of the wittiest social, cultural and political satire ever seen in a TV series; the puppeteers (Volume I includes an excellent feature explaining how it's all done), whose astounding abilities are evident in the astonishing variety of facial expressions they are able to give the dino-characters; and the actors who have to navigate the sets in cumbersome costumes, often without being able to see what they are doing. The astounding synchronization of movement, expression and dialogue make this an unforgettable viewing experience. I have watched few television shows that caused me to laugh aloud regularly - this one never fails. There are numerous priceless moments, as in Season  3's disc two episode ""Dirty Dancin', wherein at one point Earl brags to Fran about his mating abilities - the look on Fran's face is worth the price of the whole series - I have watched it again and again. It is a testament to the high art of the puppeteers. My only regret about this series is that it ran only four seasons. This review likewise applies to Volume I of the series.",1359072000,6,1802,5.2787456445993035

The show is suitable for children and is full of hidden adult humor! It is a fantastic show! Using full size adult puppets (but they don't look or move like puppets, Hensen brings to life this family of dinosaurs!

2756541,5,B000N4SA8M,"I bought this pack along with the Season 1 and 2 pack, so I was able to compare each season and each DVD back-to-back.

The case is different in that this one does not have the outer cardboard case.  However, the menu inside is the same, and the disc storing is the same.  As I said in my other review, my only issue here was with how the discs were secured in the case.  They tend to not stay put much; this isn't an issue for me as I put my DVDs in soft-shell cases and store the original casing in a big box, but it was a concern during the shipment.

The discs still arrived in perfect condition, and the migration from TV to DVD format was perfect.

The content itself is great.  Dinosaurs continues to address some major, real problems (and occassionally non-existent ones) with good delivery.  These season also contain the faux documentary episodes, which I loathed to no end, but did help to fill in the blank spots in the writers' heads.

The series finale is effective in drawing-in even the adult viewers with the final moments of the episode, and teach us about the dilemma of short-sighted society:

""Everyone's buying... WeSaySo Heaters and WeSaySo blankets....  This is the best 3rd Quarter in history!""
""Sir, I'm afraid this might be the last 3rd Quarter in history.""
""That's a 4th Quarter problem; we'll blow it up when we get to that point.  Right now, my only problem is figuring out what to do with all this money!""

I do want to add a spoiler for the ""controversial"" last episode.  The DVD includes a discussion of the controversy.  And imo, it would have been better if they'd done something besides ""extincting"" the dinosaurs (INCLUDING THE BABY!?!) There was so much fantasy and imagination involved in watching a dinosaur family who lived in a house, celebrated ""Refrigerater Day,"" had teen agers going to high school and other regular family things.  They weren't REAL dinosaurs.  We understand that scientifically speaking, the dinosaurs did become extinct.  But this is a fictional dinosaur family!  Perhaps after the show was canceled the angered writers spitefully killed off the family in the final show!  We SO WISH we hadn't ever seen that episode!

2756553,5,B000N4SA8M,"This was a favorite of mine wen it came out on TV all those years ago. I loved it. So when I heard it was coming to DVD, and I had to buy them. The characters were well written and acted, and the storylines were great. Each episode had a underlying story of some sort, and a message to pass onto the viewers. But unlike many sitcoms, the way it was presented was very different.

As mentioned by a few other reviewers, Earl and Roy are very similar to the charcters from the Honeymooners. Whether they were modeled after them or not (pretty close), they were still different. So, to say this is a rip of that show, is vastly over simplifying things.

I throughly enjoyed the show as I was perusing through the episodes, and managed to laugh at almost all of them. Other than Farscape, I cannot think of a better show using Jim Henson's puppets to this high degree of performance.

It makes comment on many of the controveries going on at the time and some that are still going on like environmental issues,prejudice, and it even had the audacity to comment on television.

""""Just skip the ""scrubs"" advertisement  i will explain that later""""  This is a good clean show that the whole family can enjoy. The packaging is well done and the video quality and color is very nice . Now you may ask why the comment on the marketing well here's why. When we purchase any family dvd series """"and we have bought a lot of them""""  with a G rating then i expect to get nothing but G rated but someone in marketing took a cheap shot by throwing a PG rated preview of the series ""scrubs"" in the mix. Here we were as a family watching the beginning of disc 1 that was playing the advertisements/previews of  Disney's New animated DVD releases when suddenly up pops this ""scrubs"" preview with them talking about sex and other talk that's geared for an adult crowd. Frankly i did not even know at the time what ""Scrubs"" was about because i had never seen it before and did not know that its more of an adult/young adult type of comedy show. Well to say the least i did not appreciate that, and i do not appreciate the way they put in an adult type preview in my family oriented DVD purchase. If i wanted some adult theme comedy then i would buy it, but i don't want it, nor do i want to pay for this type of advertisement on my Dinosaurs DVD set.

2756559,4,B000N4SA8M,"I always liked this show when ABC broadcast it in the 90's, but it seemed ABC did not have faith in Henson's team.  The program kept moving time slots, and there were long gaps between seasons (could this be due to the complexity of production?) Anyway, it seems ""Changing Nature"" was clearly meant to be a SERIES finale. It is one of the most touching you will see, and truly a revelation (I didn't catch it upon it's initial airing).

We also have a few episodes that were never aired by ABC (as a special treat), one of them a funny parody of Barney the Dinosaur. For this reason alone, fans who taped every episode MUST purchase this set for a COMPLETE collection. You also get two commentaries and two featurettes.

Dinosaurs (like the Simpsons), is one of those shows kids love, and parents appreciate because the humor is smart, not condescending.",1178841600,26,854,4.605263157894737
2756560,4,B000N4SA8M,"In all the product info for Season 3/4 of DINOSAURS, including Disney's press releases and their own website, the music video ""I'm the Baby Gotta Love Me"" is listed as a special added feature... Try to find it. On the actual packaging for the disc, it refers to a featurette called ""I'm the Baby, Gotta Love Me"" which is a nice bit about the Baby character, but the music video is not included...

I made a call to Disney's DVD department. I was put on hold for a while and then told: ""the music video was announced in early publicity as being under consideration as a possible extra, but it was decided to include the featurette instead of the music video."" I pointed out that the music video is clearly mentioned on Disney's own website. Their response: ""If you'd like a refund or exchange....""

Put on Disc 1 and play an episode called ""Little Boy Boo."" At the end of the episode is... the music video of Baby Sinclair singing ""I'm the Baby."" It's a catchy song and the visuals are a lot of fun. This is up to the Henson creative team's usual high standards. However, you can't say the same for the Disney DVD division. There is no chapter stop for the musc video. You have to scan back from the end credits to find it ..

So obviously, there is confusion and miscommunication within Disney's DVD marketing department. They announced the Baby's Music Video as a feature but were quite confused about where it was... or whether it was there at all.

I think the Jim Henson Company's work on DINOSAURS is absolutely brilliant. Smart. clever, thoughtful, great looking and hilarious. Incredibly rich with layers of clever details, DINOSAURS is entertaining on more than one level. The more you watch it, the more you discover. I highly recommend the series itself as top-notch entertainment. I still howl with laughter at the hysterical EXORCIST parody (""The Power of Rice Compels You!"") Robby's dalliance in an alternate lifestyle, (to Earl's chagrin - a Vegetarian ""Give Peas A Chance"") Charlene's falsie tail, The miniseries parody ""Nuts To War,"" TV Commentator Howard Handupme, taking on their own critics in a self-referential bit about a TV show they see, (about which Earl says it's clever and Mom says ""it's just puppets!"") and the episode about inappropriate language learned on TV, where the baby says ""Smoo!""  Rarely do you get this much Smart and Funny in the same place with great production values.

Like the Walt Disney company used to, The Jim Henson Company has a reputation for thoughtful attention to detail. The Henson creations deserve better handling than Disney is giving, but then the same could be said of the vintage Disney movie catalog. Disney doesn't do the work justice. I can only hope Disney gets its ""smoo"" together before they ""flark"" up another good creation. ; )

Update: interestingly, since I posted this, (like a couple years later) the product description here on Amazon has now been reworked to tell where the Baby's music video is.
