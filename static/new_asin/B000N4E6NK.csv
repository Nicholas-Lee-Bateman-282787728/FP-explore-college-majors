All the info you need is right there, reality check about the 'quitos, rain, bears, lodge traffic, and all. It is clear the producer/anglers favor kings and they horse 'em hard to get 'em to jump for the camera, but they cover the river and the runs and native fish well. These DVD's are excellent for the real world demonstration of what its like on river in real time. They can be a bit repetitious but that tends to be because they are shot sequentially as the float progresses-- fish kings at two creeks in succession and that's what you see. The only things missing are the adrenaline 'shakes' between hookups. Oh, and here's an old Eel River ""bottom bouncing"" trick; instead of cutting up pencil sinkers, pinch a string split shot on a 6 lb. test dropper (or 1/2 test main line) and add or remove to depth desired; a snagged split shot pulls off dropper plus you don't end up with a pocket full of too short pencils.",1202083200,,1002,4.48087431693989

Thanks for all the great info and Emails, We had a blast, and Rob at Aniak Air was great. Your video and book is a MUST before attempting this trip or you'll be just wasting time.  My book got a little soggy during the week out there (That's what happens when you live in a raft for a week or so). Fished a bunch of spots not on the maps and alot of backwater all but 2 had fish, Got Kings, Reds, Pinks, Rainbows and Chums, saw 6 Bears all together including a Sow with cubs(3) she wasn't too happy to see us floating by and let us know with a big snort before she took off, you are right they are too fast to get a camera on them.  Also saw a beautiful cinnamon colored male about the size of a mini van, he didn't seem to care, I guess if you are that big you don't worry much about anything. Him I should have got a picture of but was too busy just watching him, I guess you never really realize how big they get till you get within a few yards of them. I attached
a pic of a King I got from what we affectionately called  ""The HOG HOLE""
all biggies in there in they must all hang together. Numbered all our stops on the GPS for next time. Thanks again Bob V",1186876800,2,1177,3.936974789915966
8174829,5,B000N4E6NK,"Well Grant Fairbanks, you must be trying  to keep people away from
this little known, outstanding Kuskokwim River fishery that is in your back
yard???  Anyone who takes the time to watch the video can witness the killer fishing.  Our group just
got back from floating the Chukowan & Holitna Rivers and had an absolute blast!  THE FISHING WAS
EXCELLENT and we only saw one other group of fisherman - obviously not you since
they all were catching fish and grinnin' from ear to ear.

Interestingly enough, the well known book ""Alaska Fishing"" by Rene Limeres and Gunnar
Pederson describes the Holitna as ""Although it receives limited attention
from sport anglers (mostly locals), ...[it's] one of the most productive
fisheries in the entire region, known for good king, silver, chum, grayling,
pike, and char fishing.""

Our group rates the video, guidebook, and the Chukowan & Holitna Rivers 5
STARS!  Keep up the good work Duke Brothers!  We appreciate the detailed information you are sharing to
help nonres do-it-yourself folks like us have a great experience in Alaska.

Hey Grant - Any other rivers with dismal fishing in your area that we should try next??",1186444800,,1160,4.938144329896907
8174830,1,B000N4E6NK,after watching this video we went to the river for a float. we found other fishermen and camps up and down the river. since this is a spawning area the fish were dying and hard to catch. the char were non-existent and the float was slow. the video left out the true story of this poor fishing river. i would like my money back. our trip was made better when the down river lodges said the author was one of their old clients whom will never be invited back,1185926400,,456,4.134831460674158

8174833,2,B000N4E6NK,This video is quite repetiious and very amateurish in it's making. There is no flyfishing in this video only spin fishing for you flyfishers who are considering it.,1183939200,,164,4.892857142857143
