8365144,1,B002DGS0VK,"Most of this DVD is lecturing and educating.  The actual exercise portion is very small.

Exercises are demonstrated by animation in total silence.  Navigating through this DVD was clumsy, making the whole enterprise very amateurish.",1254528000,2,233,5.6
8365145,5,B002DGS0VK,"Fantastic, just what I have been looking for.  Being a commercial rafting guide, I have been having shoulder problems for years. I often wake up in the middle of the night with numb hands.  These stretches target specific muscles and have helped me almost immediately.  The DVD has also showed me the importance of stretching after work, to take away the painful toxins that build up in my muscles.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1248825600,3,428,4.743243243243243
