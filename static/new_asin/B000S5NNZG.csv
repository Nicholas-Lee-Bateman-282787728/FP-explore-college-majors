8204345,4,B000S5NNZG,"I enjoyed this presentation as it provides some fine historical discussion over this important Christian's life.  Especially enjoyed the actual footage of the historical places of Hus' life as they now stand.  Also, the Roman Catholic's response to Hus in the nineties, which surprised me and will followup on for sure.

What is lacking in the film of great significance is any mention of Hus' preaching the gospel as opposed to the then theological position of ""faith plus works"" and Hus' wanting to have Scriptures in language of the people.  Although many deride the other DVD on Hus from Vision Video, I believe it far better puts the real issues in focus, that of his insistence on preaching that salvation is by believing the gospel and nothing else, and wanting this to be preached into souls through language of Bible in people's language.  This would be easily scary enough for the church of his day to want to be rid of him.  This video totally omits this most important part.",1291852800,17,986,4.770588235294118

Try this DVD rather than the ""John Hus"" one distributed by Video Vision.",1267833600,3,114,4.7
