8077232,2,B000AAJ1I2,I want the DVD that the other reviewers got!!!  This video has nothing to do with stretches or with helping your hands.  this video is relaxing like watching paint dry and grass grow.  It is very relaxing... boring too.  I would have to be in a relaxed state to enjoy it though.  Would probably be fantastic as background video during yoga class or to play during reiki or a chiropractic session.,1239062400,,396,4.52112676056338
8077233,5,B000AAJ1I2,"My Reflexology Instructors advised we might think about getting this DVD for the health of our hands.  I am grateful that such a DVD exists!

Good product, exactly what I needed.",1190505600,3,178,4.709677419354839
8077234,5,B000AAJ1I2,"Note: this review is for ""Healthy Hands, Wrists and Forearms"" DVD by Martin Gray NOT the Whales, Dolphins and Chakras which I've never seen. Somehow, Amazon switched it.

Every now and then, you stumble across something truly noteworthy. This DVD is one of those things.

I noticed this DVD was offered by a massage table company and I threw it into my basket as an after-thought when I checked out with my table. I figured as I embark on massage, protective maintenance for my hands would be a good idea. I felt a little crazy - a whole DVD just for my hands?

Well, I was in for a shock. After the very first session, my hands felt unbelievably supple. It actually was like having 20 year old hands again! They felt just as they felt in the days when I was a violinist. I can hardly wait for my husband to try this out. He suffers from carpal tunnel/computer keyboard syndrome and I think this may really help him, too. Now, I think a whole DVD just for my hands is the LEAST I can do for them.

The guy who figured out these stretches/exercises really knows his stuff. I guess his life was/is his hands and out of necessity he had to figure out how to keep them in top form. This DVD is well worth it. It's nothing short of brilliant.",1166400000,8,1237,4.273504273504273
