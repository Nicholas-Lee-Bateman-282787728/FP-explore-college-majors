The story begins with a herd of Herefords, cattle raised for meat. The Lambert trucking company is there to transport 36 cattle to market. The owner complains about the exorbitant fee. Can the Cattlemen's Association do anything? [Does Barrabee remind you of a character in `Dilbert'?] Roy complains to Lambert about rising charges. Will Barrabee sell out the cattlemen? Roy stops him by suggesting shipping cattle by boat. ""Its your idea too."" Ross Lambert won't stand for this. The reception doesn't go as expected. ""We don't sing hymns."" There is a comic greeting for Mr. Popen. ""You're dern tootin'."" Then Silas Popen gets a warning via an arrow. Next there is a practical joke at the saloon. The horses on the wagon run away, but Roy Rogers catches them. Popen acts scared of this violence.

Roy goes to Lambert's saloon to ask for the missing telegram. [Note the gambling equipment there.] Can they use the steamboat to ship cattle? Lambert reports a fire on the boat, this will draw away the cowboys. There is more comedy in the barn. A horse on fire? Lambert's gang rustles the herd of cattle. The men are warned, they will pursue the rustlers. Popen's choppers fall out. Lambert and his gang plan an ambush; they hide the cattle well. There is a song for entertainment. Mary Lou tells where the cattle are hidden. ""Beneath the falls."" Lambert catches Mary Lou, but Roy and his men arrive. Lambert's gang is trapped and caught. The storm brings rain. The steamboat owner signs a contract with the cattlemen. The lower costs will enrich the cattlemen of Cherokee City and the ship owner. Will the joke of Smiley and Gabby backfire on them? The paddlewheel steamboat sails on the river. A final song for entertainment.

This story has a lot of comedy for a drama about shipping competition. Some of the comedy is dated. Roy Rogers' movies never lacked for comedy or singing. Was the emphasis on comedy a change from past dramas over economic conflict?",1281484800,,1994,4.773913043478261
