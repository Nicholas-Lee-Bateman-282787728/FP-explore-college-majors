8401514,3,B003O9XN62,"Here's a movie that's brimming with ideas ...maybe one too many ? After the interesting but highly uneven
"" Azuloscurocasinegro "" , spanish director Daniel Sanchez Zrevalo makes a movie about a group of people trying to lose weight through therapy with the help of psychologist Abel ( the gorgeous but flat Roberto Enriquez ) .
The gallery of charecters includes Andres , a forensic scientists , married and a father of two kids who hate each other , Enrique a gay tv-persona who loses his job as a promoter of a diet product when he himself eventually gains weight , Leonor an indepedent , dynamic woman who has been eating too much while her boyfriend is working out of town and Sofia , is sweet , modest girl who for no apparent reason , dates the creepy , pushy Alex .

From all this stories , only the first one , Andres' , strikes the right balance between comedy and drama . Especially good are the two young actors , Adam Jezierski and Marta Martin , who potray his kids as natural enemies .

As for the rest of our heroes , Sofia seems to discover a new side of her as the kilos drop . Her relationship with Alex is complicated and interesting but after him being so cruel to her , her feelings towards him at the end of the film don't make much sense . Neither does the ghost-like , eerie finale of her chapter of the movie .

It's a pity that the most commited perfomance from the cast is Antonio de la Vega's considering how nuts and hysterical his story is . Torre's Enrique is a character who asks for the viewer's compassion with deep personal confessions and teary eyed scenes while at the same time being a truly repulsive guy . His companion , Pillar is simply a caricature .

 So , although with so many moments of wit and interesting directorial touches , the film is half an hour too long and fails to strike a coherent tone .",1306368000,,1847,4.311239193083574
