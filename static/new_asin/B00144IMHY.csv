3122386,5,B00144IMHY,"I completed the Workshop in one sitting prior to completing the Practice.  Although the DVD doesn't include traditional strength exercises, I did experience some very light muscle soreness after completing the Workshop but for some reason not after completing the Practice.  The Workshop is 38 minutes with the following chapters:

Shoulder Warm Ups:  (7:54)
* Epaulet Arm Circles - arm circles with arms bent at elbow
* Pranic Bath - difficult to explain but a very nice fluid movement
* Anahata Arm Swings - swinging in front and in back, first touching hands and then clasping
* Pendulum Arm Swings - swinging up and over, each arm going in opposite direction
* Danda Kriya - using a rod for three different stretching/flexibility exercises.  I did not have a rod that was long enough so used a strap instead, although a rod would have been nice for the last movement.

Flexion/Extension:  (5:46)
* Arms in Flexion - movements with arms raised overhead, including arm circles
* Double Extension -  arms clasped in back and raising up as high as you can go
* Yogini Mudflap Girl & Andrey's Rack - two poses sitting on floor with arms extending in back of you
* Shoulder Shrugs
* Lat Lengthener - uses a table or ledge to stretch the lat muscles as you lean over

Internal/External Rotation:  (5:06)
* Three uniquely named poses with emphasis on rotation of the shoulder. The last pose (Holy Cow at the Trough), is done leaning forward with your elbows bent and resting on a ledge, pressing a yoga block between your hands, and slowly walking your elbows closer and closer together.  A second version of Holy Cow is done pushing back and forth with your hands.

Protraction/Retraction:  (8:15)
Protraction is drawing shoulder blades together; retraction is reaching forward for separation of the shoulder blades
* Protraction/Retraction Pushups - The emphasis here is on protraction/retraction of the shoulder, not on pushups
* Prone stretch with arms crossed in front of body
* Body Surfing - prone with arms stretched overhead, pulling yourself forward and then backwards across the floor (you will need a blanket over a smooth floor for this)
* Open Sesame - lying prone, spread arms out, roll over on to one shoulder so arm is stretched in back, adjusting hips to put feet on ground, and reaching the other arm up and over to try meet with the other hand in back

Detraction:  (2:56)
*  upward bow at wall - looks like an overhead tricep stretch, pulling your elbow in towards the head with the other hand, except that your upper hand is against a wall

Dolphin/Downward Dog:  (4:07)
Putting everything together to show how it is used in these common poses.
* Dolphin with external rotation
* Downward Dog with Bent Elbows - challenges the strength of external rotation as your elbows rotate in
* Dolphin to Dog Pushups - Start in Dolphin with external rotation, and move through bent elbow Dog into straight arms, back into Dolphin

The Practice is 43 minutes, putting each of these moves together and adding a few reps.

Round out the practice using the extras on the DVD to work the forearms and hands:
* Forearm grips (2 min)
* Wrist/Palm/Forearm Stretch (2 min)
* Blackberry stretch for the thumb (1 min)
The final Extra is arm circles on the wall (3 min) to stretch the pectoralis muscles.

There is also a Directions of Movement Primer (2 min) that explains the 12 directions of movement for the shoulder.

All in all, I really enjoyed this DVD.  I felt it did a great job of working the shoulders from each possible direction and feel that it may help prevent future issues.  I liked the focus on mobility versus strength.  I don't really have shoulder problems, so the difficult part will be finding a way to work it into my rotation. But I am glad to have in in my library.",1273708800,35,3788,4.694402420574886

3122390,5,B00144IMHY,"I really like Jill Miller's Shape Up Series. The common principle within the Series is that there's a workshop section where Jill Miller gives a clear explanation of the exercises and a practice section which obviously is meant to lead you during your practice. Compared to hips and core, the shoulder work out is easier and shorter (a good thing in my view as the only criticism I have of the other 2 workouts is that they're a bit long). Even if you don't do yoga you should be able to follow this one and I'd imagine you'd benefit tremendously from it. My girlfriend has often pain in her neck and typically manages to get better by working on her shoulders with this DVD.",1259020800,6,675,4.451612903225806
3122391,5,B00144IMHY,"This DVD is part of the Yoga Link series produced by Pranamaya. The instructor for this series is Jill Miller, who had previously created her own self-produced video series called Yoga Tune Up. This new series incorporates many aspects of Miller's prior work but adds excellent production values plus a variety of additional workout and DVD options. For starters, there are two main aspects to this DVD, the Shoulder Workshop, in which Miller uses live instruction to break down the individual moves in great detail, and the Shoulder Practice, which Miller presents the same exercises via voiceover for a more flowing practice experience. Also included is a 16-minute Breath Primer: this same segment appears on all three of the DVDs in the Yoga Link series, and it offers an opportunity to obtain detailed instruction on the types of pranayama, or yogic breathing, which Miller utilizes in these practices.

The Shoulder Workshop includes a 38-minute session plus 11 minutes of Shoulder ""Extras."" The workshop itself focuses on the 12 directions of shoulder movement (a brief primer on this precludes the workshop), with exercises on Flexion/Extension, Elevation/Depression, Internal/External Rotation, Protraction/Retraction, and Detraction. Starting from the warm-ups, Miller introduces exercises that are as unique in their ways of targeting the body as they are in their fanciful names (from ""Jane Fonda Light Bulb Exercise"" to ""Pin the Arms on the Yogi"" to ""Holy Cow at the Troth""). She concludes the workshop by putting all of the various directions of movement together for a Dolphin/Down Dog sequence. The Shoulder Extras which follow include short (1-3 minutes) stretches for the forearms, wrists, palms, thumbs, and shoulders; these exercises can be performed virtually anywhere. Miller's advanced knowledge of anatomy and human movement shines through her teaching, and her easygoing, down-to-earth style allows her to connect with her students in a straightforward manner.  At 43 minutes, the Shoulder Practice is actually slightly longer than the Workshop, as it includes a full number of repetitions for all the exercises. Although Miller instructs via voiceover here, she still offers plenty of cues on breathing and especially form. As mentioned above, she performs all the same exercises as in the workshop, and so she uses the same props as well (yoga mat, 1-2 blocks, dowel, blanket, and table).

Although the DVD case rates the intended audience for this practice as ""beginners to teachers,"" I think that those new to yoga are likely to be intimidated by the level of flexibility demanded by many of the movements. Miller does frequently remind viewers that they don't need to look like her; she encourages each individual to go at their own pace and to respect their own limits, yet she herself is super-flexible, which can be daunting at times.  Overall, however, the goal of these shoulder exercises is to mobilize the shoulders from every angle, and by the end of the practice, Miller certainly achieves this objective.  This DVD is ideal for counteracting the effects of poor posture, overcoming imbalances, and strengthening weak muscles.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Jill Miller's Yoga Link series in general and this DVD in particular to any experienced yoga practitioners; few other yoga teachers will challenge you to explore your body in such an intense yet accessible manner.",1251504000,22,3413,5.299445471349353

8254282,5,B00144IMHY,"MY SKILL LEVEL: Happy beginner....Um, I've been rolling through the same 2 beginner level yoga DVDs for like 5 years now. I know the basic poses. I have them committed to memory. While that gives me some measure of confidence when I'm doing it, I don't practice consistently and am not a flexible person. I work at a PC for hours on end, text too much, garden too hard, etc. I have lots of repetitive use issues! My shoulders are crunchy. My neck is knotty. My hamstrings are tight. I'm a trainwreck. My massage therapist thinks I should just take up drinking. This series has been EXACTLY what I needed!

As far as this series goes...If your shoulders are an issue but you're new to yoga, don't sweat it. No matter your skill level, always remember that if you can't go fully into a pose, life goes on. You still benefit from the effort. If you'd like another minute to breathe it in, hit pause. Jill explains the reason why you're doing each stretch and exactly what part of you it will help.

I LOVE the Yoga Link series. I've never been a fan of Jill Miller's flow yoga, but this stuff is just perfect for my needs. A lot of nontraditional asanas that Jill created to fix & maintain areas she'd injured as a dancer. If you have any shoulder issues, this takes you through the full range of motion in a non-fussy, non-ohm sort of way. As you stretch, you can feel how clicking that mouse over and over doesn't just affect your hand...it affects your arm and, of course, your shoulder. Blood starts going places where it is needed.

The 35 minute workshop is a good place to start. Learn each of the poses that you'll need to integrate them into the more flowing workout. Bonus: During the workshop, you'll feel where you need the most work. Many of the shoulder stretches can be done throughout the day when you take a break from work. I can't say enough about this series. It is as challenging as you allow it to be and so beneficial.

(If you don't have yoga blocks, use books. If you don't have a staff, just do as I do and use a mop handle or pool cue. If you have a hip-height table or bookshelf or couch nearby, that will be helpful for 2 of the poses.)",1440547200,,2162,4.330864197530865

8254284,1,B00144IMHY,"Hoping to avoid shoulder joint replacement--post-injury diagnostics had revealed a previously unknown underlying condition--I purchased a number of shoulder fitness/rehab DVDs, including Jill Miller's Shoulder Shape-Up.

This workout is indeed thorough and likely effective--for Gumbies.  Injured and mobility-impaired as I was, I'd have landed on the operating table within minutes if I could even have attempted it.  In fact, given my underlying condition (a glenoid cyst), attempting it at any time during the previous 5-10 years would have been disastrous.  The weight-bearing and hyperextensions might have collapsed my entire shoulder joint.

J.B. Berns' more low-key Rehab Your Body at Home saved my shoulders.

To be fair, I should probably have given this workout three stars--for thoroughness, good organization and presentation, and Jill Miller's delightful personality.  But I remember being so appalled by the potential hazards that I ditched it within 24 hours--a record for me.  No second chances for this one!  Such a workout should be stamped with a warning, just like a cigarette package.  ""For Certified Gumbies only.  Everyone else is at risk.""",1411689600,2,1164,5.632183908045977

Her style, her knowledge, her way of integrating multiple disciplines into yoga movements that are uniquely hers, create a revolutionary and effective style that will help you become stronger and more open in your shoulders.

I daily use many of the movements contained within the DVD.  As a yogi who struggles with tight and weak shoulders, these movements have helped me be able to move into handstand and forearm balance while maintaining good form.

What do you have to lose for the low price?  I was so impressed and amazed by the quality of her teachings and the effective exercises that I ordered all three in the series!  Truly a steal at the price and a veritable pot of gold that can be referenced again and again!",1377648000,,780,4.698529411764706
8254288,5,B00144IMHY,"So I had reached the 3 month mark of post-surgery rehab for rotator cuff surgery and I was so frustrated I was just a beast. My progress was slow at best and at this point, I STILL had a posterior capsule restriction that didn't allow me to rotate my arm behind my back at all and I was still waking up with a stiff shoulder and a limited ability to reach overhead. If it weren't for the fact that I had a full thickness tear in supraspinatus and I HAD to have the surgery, I would never go through this again if I could have avoided it - especially now that my range of motion was so badly affected AFTER surgery. Pissed off is an understatement.

So I searched around on looking for yoga for shoulders (I am a huge advocate of the wisdom and efficacy of yoga for almost all things involving the body) and I decided on this video. After reviewing the tape, I will start tomorrow - one of the things that I realized is that some of these movements are the same as the ones that I kept doing over and over again in PT with no visible results. I suspect the problem is that the movements in PT were not as thorough and more immportantly, the instruction for doing the exercise was not nearly as thorough as Jill's instruction in this video.

I am really impressed by her teaching and her selection of exercises, she takes you through the ENTIRE range of motion for the shoulders, her instruction is extremely thorough (and 20x better than any instruction I got in physical therapy for anything, those lazy monkeys) and I am confident that this video will correct what alot of wasted time in PT this last month could not. I will post a review indicating my progress with this video in about 3 months.

For now, I just want to say that as a yoga video and an instructional one, Jill Miller is worth every penny you invest in her videos.",1349049600,4,1832,4.304347826086956

She's an expert, for sure, and really works out the shoulders to make them stronger.  The workouts are hard, not for the faint of heart, but very worth it.",1318464000,2,308,4.581818181818182
8254290,5,B00144IMHY,"This DVD is part of the new Yoga Link series offered by Pranamaya. The instructor for this series is Jill Miller, who had previously created her own self-produced video series called Yoga Tune Up. This new series from Pranamaya (which also includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Core-Integration/dp/B00144IMHE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Core Integration</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Link-Hip-Helpers-with-Jill-Miller/dp/B00144IMHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Link: Hip Helpers with Jill Miller</a>) incorporates many aspects of Miller's prior work but adds excellent production values plus a variety of additional workout and DVD options. For starters, there are two main aspects to this DVD, the Shoulder Workshop, in which Miller uses live instruction to break down the individual moves in great detail, and the Shoulder Practice, which Miller presents the same exercises via voiceover for a more flowing practice experience. Also included is a 16-minute Breath Primer: this same segment appears on all three of the DVDs in the Yoga Link series, and it offers an opportunity to obtain detailed instruction on the types of pranayama, or yogic breathing, which Miller utilizes in these practices.

The Shoulder Workshop includes a 38-minute session plus 11 minutes of Shoulder ""Extras."" The workshop itself focuses on the 12 directions of shoulder movement (a brief primer on this precludes the workshop), with exercises on Flexion/Extension, Elevation/Depression, Internal/External Rotation, Protraction/Retraction, and Detraction. Starting from the warm-ups, Miller introduces exercises that are as unique in their ways of targeting the body as they are in their fanciful names (from ""Jane Fonda Light Bulb Exercise"" to ""Pin the Arms on the Yogi"" to ""Holy Cow at the Troth""). She concludes the workshop by putting all of the various directions of movement together for a Dolphin/Down Dog sequence. The Shoulder Extras which follow include short (1-3 minutes) stretches for the forearms, wrists, palms, thumbs, and shoulders; these exercises can be performed virtually anywhere. Miller's advanced knowledge of anatomy and human movement shines through her teaching, and her easygoing, down-to-earth style allows her to connect with her students in a straightforward manner.

At 43 minutes, the Shoulder Practice is actually slightly longer than the Workshop, as it includes a full number of repetitions for all the exercises. Although Miller instructs via voiceover here, she still offers plenty of cues on breathing and especially form. As mentioned above, she performs all the same exercises as in the workshop, and so she uses the same props as well (yoga mat, 1-2 blocks, dowel, blanket, and table). The DVD case rates the intended audience for this practice as ""beginners to teachers,"" but I think that those new to yoga are likely to be intimidated by the level of flexibility demanded by many of the movements. Miller sometimes demands much from her viewers in other ways, too. For example, her ""Body Surfing"" exercise, part of the shoulder retraction series, is ideally performed lying on a blanket while pulling yourself across a long expanse of smooth flooring--a bit tough for those of us practicing on carpet (the trash bag substitution is less than adequate, and most home exercisers are likely to have small space restrictions as well).

The goal of these shoulder exercises is to mobilize the shoulders from every angle, and by the end of the practice, Miller certainly achieves this objective (your muscles will no doubt achingly bear witness to this fact). This DVD is ideal for counteracting the effects of poor posture, overcoming imbalances, and strengthening weak muscles.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Jill Miller's Yoga Link series in general and this DVD in particular to any experienced yoga practitioners; few other yoga teachers will challenge you to explore your body in such an intense yet accessible manner.",1292544000,,4076,5.777038269550749
