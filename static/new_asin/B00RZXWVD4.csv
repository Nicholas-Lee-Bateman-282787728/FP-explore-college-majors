6938026,2,B00RZXWVD4,The quality of this movie is poor looks  cheap and homemade  and has been done over and over again.  Far as  what we seen before like found footage movies this far from  what the price is worth for paying to see this but I have passion but for those who exptations are high this not for you it scary in a way but  the production isnwack,1429747200,2,336,4.015151515151516

6938030,1,B00RZXWVD4,"This is one of those movies where the reviews were pretty helpful.  I was wondering at first if the horrible grainy black and white with bad sound was my computer with a bad connection, sadly no, it is the movie.  They do these flashbacks that are in color, now I have never heard of that, usually it is the other way around where the movie is in color and the flashback is in black and white.  All in all the movie was just too unbearable to watch.",1448064000,3,449,4.137931034482759
6938031,1,B00RZXWVD4,"Let me start off this extremely negative review by saying this: I did not pay $99.00 a year for Amazon Prime to watch streaming crap like this. Yes, it was free, but free in the sense that I didn't have to pay anything to watch it, not free in the sense that once I begin watching a movie, I am obligated to watch the whole thing to report back to my readers. And this 80-minute film is an endurance test that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. First of all, 95% of the movie is in grainy black & white and looks to have been filmed on someone's old camera phone. You can actually see the spotlight that someone is holding to illuminate scenes that were shot in the dark. Secondly, the dialogue seems to have been recorded directly from the phone because the further the person is away from the camera, the lower the dialogue (I was wearing headphones and could only make out 10% of the dialogue!). Thirdly, director/screenwriter/co-producer Richard Mansfield (who has a film coming out in 2016 called VIDEO KILLER, which you can be sure I will avoid) inserts color scenes as flashbacks that make no sense whatsoever. The story is so simple, you could write it on the head of a pin (although Mansfield tries to make it look like some art film): Two women, Katy (Katy Vans) and Rachel (Rachel Dale), are hired to clean up an old entertainment museum where Charlie Chaplin once lived (if you squint and look sideways, you may see some of his old film posters). Somehow they are being tormented by the Mothman (played by Mansfield's brother David, who is also a co-producer), whom we barely glimpse. We only get to see him in silhouette, staring through the window with glowing eyes and a brief scene of him standing behind Rachel when she lights a match. Director Mansfield also has the annoying habit of looping loud screeching noises to the soundtrack to keep us awake and other background noises that sound like someone dropping metal objects into a 50 gallon metal drum. DO NOT be fooled by the DVD cover (yes, this piece of crap actually got a DVD release!), because that scene is not in the film. The fact that the cover is in color is already a lie to the viewer. This film just meanders along as the two English women prattle on, go to sleep (Rachel with her boyfriend Darren [Darren Munn]), do very little work and the Mothman keeps calling Katy on the phone asking her to let him in. That's about all there is to the film. Where is the horror? Where is the curse? The film just ends with no conclusion and with the shortest end credits sequence I think I have ever saw (The logo for ""Mansfield Dark Productions"" is a hell of a lot scarier that the entire film!). Please, I beg of you, don't be fooled into watching this piece of homemade trash. It was probably filmed in one day and looks it. Imagine this: You take all the most boring parts of your home movies and edit them into an 80-minute video movie. That would be a thousand times better than watching this film. All I know is that I had an extreme headache after watching it from squinting (sometimes the grain is so heavy, you can't make out what is going on) and had to pop a sleeping pill and go to the alternate universe where pure crap like this doesn't play. If you really hate somebody and want to get back at them, tape their eyelids open and make them watch this stinking pile of crap. I guarantee that person will never bother you again. This is the nadir of filmmaking. I'd go as far to say that this is not a film at all; just a bunch of loosely connected scenes to fill enough time to pass it off as a movie. I believe what this ""film"" really needs is a metal garbage can, a container of gasoline and a match. Do yourself a favor and watch THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES (2002) instead. Also starring Stephen Glover. A Wild Eye Releasing DVD Release. Not Rated, but how do you rate s***? There is nothing in this film that is offensive at all. If there were, at least the film would have something to write about.",1448064000,9,3984,4.392422192151556

6938034,1,B00RZXWVD4,"If you like jerky camera shots, if black and white film is your thing, if you don't mind looking at something or other through a filter which makes it look even more grainy and poorly defined, if you don't care about plot or cohesion or decent acting or passable special effects or being scared while watching an alleged horror movie, then this film is for you.

6938036,1,B00RZXWVD4,"Okay. I admit it up front. I was one of those suckers who, according to P.T. Barnum, is born every minute.  I believed the count of four stars for this ""movie."" I ordered it because I was impressed by the book THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES by John Keel and by the expertly directed and photographed film THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES starring Richard Gere and Alan Bates, two class-act actors. In other words, I am a Mothman fan.

So I am a sucker. I admit it.  When I was a kid and a young man, I made my own 8mm horror movies. Amateur stuff, of course. But at least they had a plot. At least I did not palm them off on buyers of DVD movies. They were in color, but silent.

This ""movie"" is really a silent film. The characters speak, but they might as well not have bothered. They mumble to themselves as if no movie were being made. Mainly, they just amble around in a film museum/library looking through files or making notes, photographed by a cameraman who does not know how to frame persons or objects. He (she?) DOES know how to focus on female necklines, filming (if that is the word) with what looks like it might have been a cellphone with a built-in video camera, complete with a light that creates a brighter circle in the middle of over half of the images. The other half appear to be available-light shots, and some are hidden by shadowy grain effects.

Then we have some beach scenes filmed in a faded color process, like old 8mm images blown up. Why these scenes, with one of the three main characters playing with a whistle and looking amazed when a shadowy character shows up, are in faded color appearing within the construct of a virtually black-and-white ""movie"" is never explained. Are these dreams? Flashbacks?

Many close-ups show the ladies being frightened -- but we rarely see of what? The cacophonous sounds that pass for music often screech at us as if to tell us that something is happening, even when it is not. Some close-ups are rather sharp and clear, unlike most of the ""movie,"" but they seem to serve no purpose. When the young ladies sleep, they sleep with their clothes on. Even when a new girl sleeps with the male character (a boss? director? museum curator?) she remains dressed in bed even while he wears his underwear. Why? What is the relationship here between these two?

Every once in a while, the screen goes black, often for no reason that I could perceive. Sometimes these are fades to black, but usually these are just cuts to a black screen. The longer black passages have sounds on the soundtrack, just as when we heard a phone ring off screen and sometimes hear a person answering. Is the creepy voice supposed to be a mothman? Oooooooo.

Speaking of the alleged mothman, what are his motivations here? The mothmen are supposed to be intelligent creatures, maybe more intelligent than humans. Their motives may not be human, as Alan Bates says in THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, but they did do more in that film than just peer through windows like a creature in a Halloween Batman costume or crawl around on the floor of the museum scaring the ladies (never the male, it seems). Why are they here? Why this movie library?

Did some viewers really find this to be frightening? These mothmen made The Babadook look terrifying by comparison. This ""movie"" made the film UNDER THE SKIN seem to be a fast-paced, well-editing exercise in gripping non-stop terror by comparison.

Of course, this is not a professional production, and I give young filmmakers kudos for trying to be experimental. Maybe they will eventually learn the craft of editing and pacing, of presenting a story, and be able to graduate from Freshman Horror 101. In the meantime, should this experimental project be offered for sale as a real DVD film?

Just asking. If this is THE MOTHMAN CURSE, who is being cursed?",1444176000,3,3813,4.609144542772861
6938037,5,B00RZXWVD4,"This is an offbeat horror film with a very heavy, creepy atmosphere to it.

I originally saw this film on You Tube under the title ""The Owlman"".  It was slightly longer with almost 4 additional minutes compared to this DVD release.

The point of the film is just to create a chilling, foreboding feeling...and that it does. It is filmed in black and white, which tends to make some scenes harder to see, but adds to the heavy atmosphere. Images of the large, black winged creature with glowing eyes in windows, beaches, and rooftops. Unforgettable.

It takes patience to watch this film.

The film doesn't have much dialogue and is difficult to hear when there is dialogue. But the characters are successful in his/her parts conveying the feeling of the coming doom someone will eventually encounter.

There are deleted scenes and trailers. These helps in explaining the story.

One of the women decides to make a trip to investigate a legend. She finds a whistle and blows into it, unknowingly summoning the Owlman/Mothman. The slow hunt begins.

She feels as if she is being watched. Strange sounds and knocking begin over the coming weeks.  She begins working in an old movie museum cataloging. The museum is large and dreary.

An old friend is hired. She also begins to hear strange noises and sees odd things. In the evenings, she holds seances with her boyfriend and unknowingly invite a spirit into their home. In the YouTube version, another friend joined them, but she was deleted from the DVD release.

As the movie progresses, the hunt intensifies. The Owlman/Mothman is seen on buildings, in the museum, outside of their homes, and inside at the foot of the bed.

Don't expect a big budget mainstream film. But do expect a low budget, off-beat, arty frightening film filled will startling and chilling images.",1433203200,4,1821,4.857605177993528

We live about three hours away but I go with my husband when he has business there because its so beautiful and the people are fun.

8696643,2,B00RZXWVD4,"I loved: the creepy feel of the movie and the sets (especially the cinema archives) as well as the quirky, non-linear story.  The premise was interesting.  A very nightmare-like, eerie quality to some of the scenes, very well done.

I liked: the found-footage-FEEL and the goosebumps caused by something in the shadows.  The entity was effective, although resembles the silhouette of a 1940s Batman.  Scenes where he is creeping around ""outside the field of vision"" of the characters was quite creative.  The acting conveyed a good feel for the characters; not tremendously challenging, but believable.

I didn't like: the looseness of the plot.  You had to fill in the blanks with your imagination, which left me less than satisfied with any payoff.  Not sure of what I was watching as far as a story line because the dialog (even when heard) explained very little.  Rather cheap tie-in with Mothman, the cryptid (although it probably worked in getting viewership).

I hated: mumble, mumble, mumble, ABSURDLY LOUD SOUND EFFECT over and over...keep your volume control nearby.  Iwanted to enjoy the film, not tend to mismatched sound levels. The story is minimal enough and you need all the help you can get, the dialog contributes very little to your understanding.  Only glaciers advance less slowly than this plot, way too much ""nothing"" going on.  Bring coffee.

Conclusion:
You will get chills and creeps but the film is a lot of work to get through (probably more than it needs to be).  It will leave you thinking about it for a while, though.  Add a star if you enjoy atmospheric settings.",1456531200,,1596,4.917602996254682

8696645,5,B00RZXWVD4,"At times we forget that movies are moving images and sometimes those images are enough to tell us what we need to know about the film itself. The Mothman Curse is one of those films. I recently picked up a copy of the T.M.C on DVD and I am glad that I did. I won't go into what the film is about as others here have already done that,but I will say that the film does have a very creepy atmosphere and style that I was able to get into right away. I have always been a sucker for any horror movie that has a person or creature just standing in the shadows watching the victim before they strike and this movie has a bunch of scenes like that. The film is in both B&W and washed out color and both work well in showing a simple but scary creature. I like the color scenes where a woman first comes across the beast cloaked in black on a beach and later she see's it again while investigating an old castle. Later the devil starts showing up in her home and at work while also making phone calls to her house demanding that she ""let him in!"" It is true that this movie really doesn't have anything to do with the classic Mothman but who cares? The film may be too slow for some and it does not always follow  linear story telling but that is just fine with me as it feels more like a nightmare than a movie. I watched this film about 2 weeks ago and it is still in my head. I hope more horror fans give this one a chance. It is worth it!",1452297600,,1435,3.982638888888889
