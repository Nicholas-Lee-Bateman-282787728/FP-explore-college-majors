2023779,5,B0001Q5U0I,"The bumble bee ""Action Words 1-3"" videos are excellent. They helped my 18-mon son to speak and read greatly.  Every word is so well illustrated in the vedio! The best part of them: My son loves these videos so madly and therefoer learned words from them so quickly!!! There are about 23 words in each vedio.

And the ""Vocabulary Builder 1-5"" are also excellent.  Especially the ""Vocabulary builder 1-3"" have 5 multilanguage that you can choose: English, French, Spanish, German, and Japanese.  That is 5-in-1 that can save you lots of money.  They also have other extra benefits features such as ""sign language"" and ""Question & answer""!

The ""Motorized Madness"" is also good, it has 10 machines such as ""airplane, bulldozer, dump truck, backhoe loader, helicopter, bucket truck, boat, motlecycle, fire truck, and bus."" It also explains each part of the machine, like the wings, propellers, engine, cab...

The baby bumble bee surely produce the best of the best infant and kids reading program vedios in the market--as good as Dr. Titzer's ""Your baby can read 1-5"" DVDs and Dr. Glenn Dorman's ""How to teach your baby to read"" book.

I love baby bumble bee's ""Opposites"", ""Motorize"", ""Actions words 1-3"" and ""vocabulary builders 1-5"" the most. Highly recommended!",1125705600,6,1262,5.033653846153846
8016081,1,B0001Q5U0I,I bought it from SF GOODWILL seller. It only plays for few minutes but then no more sound afterwords. Very disappointed.,1448928000,,120,4.761904761904762

8016083,3,B0001Q5U0I,"My 2.5 year old girl seems to like it, so far, but it doesn't seem to teach her much, plus it's still too advanced for her, as she has a delayed speech problem (due to emotional trauma).  The only thing she's learned from it, thus far, is how to whisper (which is good for me).  ;o)  I really think what they should've added to this DVD is showing people's lips (up close) forming the word over & over again, as they introduce each new word.  In my opinion, it's very boring & doesn't teach suitably enough for a young toddler with a speech delay.  I wouldn't recommend this.",1426291200,,575,4.287037037037037
8016084,5,B0001Q5U0I,"I purchased this item from the seller 1up video games, it's used so I had it cheaper though I had bad experiences with previous used items, I still took the plunge and this time I didn't go wrong it didn't look like it's used it looks like it's brand new.. My son is interested in this did so I've been looking for the 2nd and 1st volume of this action words dvd from this seller but sadly they don't have it.. Sigh..",1423785600,,417,4.097560975609756

8016086,5,B0001Q5U0I,"My son loooooved these videos. I read some reviews before I bought them. Some people complained about the videos being too boring. I'll list what I liked about it:

1) The video is slow, no unnecessary distractions. Hence, it's more likely that your chile would increase his/her vocab from these videos
2) The video first names the action e.g jump in one illustration and then the next illustration, the action word is used as a sentence. E.g. The boy is jumping

I bought the Action Words 1,2 and 3 and I'm glad I did. In my next life, I'll probably buy the whole Vocabulary builder series",1399420800,,590,4.556603773584905
8016087,5,B0001Q5U0I,"My daughter LOVES these videos. She has had them since she was 6 months old. She sits and watches the whole thing and when she's playing and i pop one in she immediately wants to sit on my lap and watch her vocabulary. We watch Volume 1 in the AM, Volume 2 in the afternoon and Volume 3 in the evening. She already knows these words and can mimic the kids on the video.",1369699200,,369,4.0
8016088,5,B0001Q5U0I,"My 4 yro daughter has autism and could only speak 20 words , l bought vol 1 -2 and 3 and play it on her tv from the time she woke up untill the time she went to bed 10 days later she could say 73 words and staring to use double words, and she loves it, l think when the doctor tells you your child has autism they should recommend these dvd's they help my daughter so much and l think they would help your child too, AAAAA",1348704000,,422,3.752808988764045
8016089,5,B0001Q5U0I,My daughter is 2.5 and loves these videos. She quickly picked up all these verbs and often imitates the children in these videos. I highly recommend these videos for children with speech delays.,1235433600,3,194,4.909090909090909
8016090,5,B0001Q5U0I,"My 14 month old loves this DVD. She is always saying and trying to imitate the action represented on this show. She is truly engaged every time I put it on. The only small problem I have is the with the action of ""cry"" where a few kids and babies cry. It's a bit heartbreaking to watch them. Other than that I am a satisfied customer and plan to purchase more of these Action Words!

The DVD goes through many actions like pour, float, bang, fly, lick, chew, cry, wiggle, roll, and whisper.",1166832000,3,490,4.268817204301075
