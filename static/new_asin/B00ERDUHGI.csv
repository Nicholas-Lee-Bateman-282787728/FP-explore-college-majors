8608654,4,B00ERDUHGI,"A great film by Katz and Kilbourne showing the problems of alcohol on campus and how it is viewed through the media. If you are an instructor and teaching a course that includes discussions of alcohol, then this is a great video. Not only is it relevant to students of today, but the issues it covers are also excellent. I especially liked one of the extras which are collected commercials glamorizing alcohol (10 minutes long).",1464912000,,428,4.72
