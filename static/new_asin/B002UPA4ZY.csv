3992543,5,B002UPA4ZY,"This show is GREAT! David Foster & Andrea Bocelli  always do it right!
Best holiday show I have seen! I wish it was on BLU- RAY too!!",1260576000,,133,3.925925925925926
3992544,5,B002UPA4ZY,"When I pre-ordered this the notes said it was 90 mins.  The show is that length but in addition there is the extra 26 minutes telling how the project was being made. So, this is really a 2 hour DVD.  The  price is very reasonable.  You just never tire of this program. I had watched it on PBS several times but still wanted to listen more because this makes you feel ready for the holiday season.",1260489600,2,396,4.171052631578948
3992545,5,B002UPA4ZY,"This Christmas DVD is incomparable. It has a superb Christmas feel good factor.

Andrea's singing is so versatile throughout and there is something for everyone here. Fun and humour with the muppets, majestic singing with the Mormon Choir, modern renditions of old carols, A Child is This is absolutely beautiful with Andrea and Mary J Blige, Ave Maria stately and sung with such brevity by Andrea, Blue Christmas, with Reba McEntire and Andrea gives a haunting quality, not to be missed.

In conclusion anyone who loves Christmas and tradition will love this DVD and I would recommend this to lovers of good music. This DVD will be enjoyed for many years to come by me and my family.",1260144000,38,684,4.788135593220339
3992546,5,B002UPA4ZY,"I had a lovely surprise this morning; my DVD arrived early!

I haven't stopped playing it all day so far, it really is a wonderful, feel good Christmas concert. An absolute must for Andrea and Christmas fans alike.

Andrea is his usual inspiring self with lots of special guests something for everyone, don't hesitate to buy several copies; one for yourself and more for gifts. You can't go wrong with this old fashioned, heart warming treat.",1260144000,8,442,4.802631578947368
3992547,5,B002UPA4ZY,"I cannot wait to get my very own copy of this masterpiece.  I, too, watched it on PBS and again and again.  I'm still not tired of watching it.  If I were smart enough I would have copied it; however, it appears that a block exists so it is off to the Amazon store on 12-8-09 to buy it.

I have said before if David Foster is involved in any way I will buy it.  He is as top notch as any single magician can get.  He took barely unknowns and turned them into super stars.  He too a multi-talented Andrea Bocelli and demonstrated the singers superior talents.  The combination of the two performers is enhanced by the addition of several other super stars who simply add more talent to an already talent laden show.  Put it this way:  if one likes Christmas music, talented performers, and really good sound you will not miss the amount this DVD costs.",1259712000,,851,4.29559748427673
3992548,5,B002UPA4ZY,"I saw this when PBS aired it on television and was blown away! This is something I will watch every year at Christmas.

3992549,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Being an Aussie fan of David Foster's music (since the ""St. Elmo's Fire"" days) I have followed his career as a musician, writer, producer, and arranger for nearly 25 years.  Following his knockout ""Hitman"" Concert, PBS Special, and ultimate CD/DVD release, I was so much hoping for a Christmas 2009 DVD release of a ""David Foster and Friends"" Concert Tour which has been underway since May this year.  Well, my wish has been granted with this soon to be released ""Andrea Bocelli and David Foster - My Christmas"" Concert from the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles, CA.  This concert dvd features the absolutely astounding David Foster and Andrea Bocelli (who always work beautifully together), along with extraordinarily special performances with Natalie Cole on the intimately arranged ""The Christmas Song"" and Reba McEntire on ""Blue Christmas""; Mary J. Blige on the hauntingly beautiful arrangement of ""What Child Is This""; and Katherine Jenkins on the operatically spellbinding ""I Believe"", all under the soaring orchestrations of William Ross.  Truly, this has ""CLASSIC"" stamped all over it.  If you are a lover of great holiday music, great musicians, great singers, and great orchestrators, this one's for you.",1259280000,48,1210,5.248704663212435

3992790,5,B002UPA4ZY,"If you enjoy Andrea Bocelli's voice, there's plenty to love about this DVD.  My only ""complaint"" would be that it should have been about a half-hour longer; the concert sped by very quickly!  Time flies when you're having fun.  All of the guest stars' voices blended nicely with Andrea's, and I enjoyed the variety of songs - from ""Ave Maria"" to ""Santa Claus is coming to town.""  The DVD is of good quality; even on my ancient 1997 TV the picture and sound are quite satisfying.

Bocelli's voice ranges from operatic (""Adeste Fidelis"" and ""Angels we have Heard on High"", for example) to lyrically beautiful (""Silent Night"" or ""White Christmas"") to softly enchanting (""Caro Gesu Bambino"").  I especially enjoyed the original French version of O Holy Night, which is titled ""Minuit Chretiens"".  Also, the duet ""What Child is This"" with Mary J. Blige is especially memorable.

Even for folks who might not be Bocelli fans, this is nice, old-fashioned Christmas family fare with a good selection of singers for the duets - Mary J. Blige, Reba McIntyre, Natalie Cole, Katherine Jenkins....and even the Muppets manage to sing Jingle Bells with gusto!  In addition, the adult choir, the children singing on ""Santa Claus""  and the Salvation Army boys' choir do a beautiful job, as does the orchestra.  What's not to like?",1372291200,6,1313,4.922727272727273

I think Andrea Bocelli is the best singer and the orchestra back up is just wonderful.,1359504000,,245,4.4222222222222225
3992811,4,B002UPA4ZY,I saw this show 2 years ago on PBS and thought it was great and we bought the CD. This year we wanted to buy the DVD because it would not have all the PBS commercials for contributions and we wanted it for future Christmas' as there is a lack of good Christmas shows.

3992827,5,B002UPA4ZY,"I can not say enough good things about this release. Most concerts don't have a high replay value for me, but this one does. This concert is great for people who like Christmas music performed in a traditional manner, no contemporary re-workings of the songs here. Andrea's voice, a always, is stunning as are the voices of the guests. The DTS surround mix is worth the price alone, you will need a surround decoder to hear it, but it definitely is worth it!",1345680000,,458,4.530120481927711
3992828,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Andrea Bocelli and David Foster,what more can you say about 2 people that have made it to the top in the music world. The show was of perfection on everynote. Shows of this caliber are not seen every day or in this case every year. It was worth every penny in price for this DVD to watch a Holiday concert of this type on your big screen tv if you have one ,it is the next best thing to being there live. A great show if you were able to even get tickets for something like this,but I was very satisfied just having a DVD, to watch the talents of these 2 wonderful people perform with style and class,something that you just don't get much of anymore. Only on PBS will you see shows of this kind,and when I saw this one on PBS,I just had to order it,for I am a big fan of both of these artist in music. Found it on Amazon,they came through as always,price was wright,service was great and just in time for some great Christmas family entertainment. Beats watching all the garbage thats on the tube these days. On a score of 1 to 10,I give it an 11,a must have DVD if you like the talents of these 2 stars,the writting talents of David Foster that he brings to the music world,and the most powerful Adrea Bocelli voice,a must have for your concert collection.",1331769600,,1258,4.224066390041494

3992852,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Andrea Bocelli is a marvel. He has a strong, glorious voice that handles all sorts of music well, and he's a very sweet person as well. His collaboration with David Foster is a happy one. This is a great Christmas special. Bocelli sings in six languages by my count. His guest stars include stellar female performers who do great duets with him. He even sings with the Muppets. Set design and costumes are appealing as well. We enjoyed this special so much on PBS that we decided we wanted to watch it every year - without the pledge breaks!",1325289600,,541,4.474747474747475
3992853,5,B002UPA4ZY,"The arrangements are interesting, exciting and unique. And there is great variety with duets with other artists.
 I recently gave this DVD as a Christmas gift to my chime choir as we are playing ""God Bless Us Everyone.""I knew the DVD would help the players learn the song but they would also remember each year the times we played together.  The choir has enjoyed this DVD so much. One comment from a player said the music so beautiful it made her cry.",1325289600,,452,4.5

I did everything possible to verrify the reason this dvd doesn't play and notice that something is wrong. Now i lost all my investment.,1321315200,2,296,4.2105263157894735
3992858,4,B002UPA4ZY,"Let's just get to it. The Singapore Special Deluxe Edition contains BOTH the CD AND the FULL LENGTH DVD. The booklet is a hybrid of the standard CD with extra pages devoted to the DVD.

The DVD is chock full of collaborations. Firstly, there are the various children and young adult choirs. Then there are the divas like Natalie Cole, Reba McEntire, Mary J. Blidge and Katherine Jenkins. And then THE DIVA of all divas Miss Piggy with the Muppets. And an out of this world performance with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. There are no highlights here. The entire DVD is in itself a highlight.

In the making of My Christmas, David Foster ""suggested stupidly"" changing sets to give it that 60s TV feel. I like that self deprecating humor. As in all shows with Bocelli, Foster's always vying for a share of the spotlight. Objectively speaking, the set changes give the TV special a warm and fuzzy feeling. Very nicely done. So no reason to feel insecure Mr Foster.

The difference between the DVD and the CD is that the DVD contains performances of Ave Maria and the Holiday Piece Intro not on the CD. The DVD features Reba McEntire on Blue Christmas and Courtney Blooding crooning softly on the CD.

I got this CD/DVD at a single CD price last Christmas. I'll have to say it is one of my bestest buys, given that I can hear and watch the maestro in action! Bravo Bocelli!",1312329600,6,1367,4.522267206477733
3992859,2,B002UPA4ZY,The video and audio quality is not really good compare to most DVD should be. Feels like cheap production or those bought in pirated store quality.,1306886400,2,147,4.6923076923076925
3992870,5,B002UPA4ZY,"There is something for everyone in this well edited live performance.  Bocelli's vocals and Foster's arrangements are superb.  The capstone is the Lord's Prayer with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, absolutely thrilling!  Don't miss it!",1297987200,,232,5.764705882352941
3992871,5,B002UPA4ZY,"It is a beautifully crafted media. I bought it for my grandparents that loved it on PBS. However, my 4 year old enjoyed it just as much as they did. The Muppets addition just shows how they can integrate all ages into art. Bocelli's voice is soothing and striking at the same time. David Foster's narration and lead into each song just keeps you in front of the screen. This is something worth having for the special family days.",1296777600,,429,4.443037974683544
3992872,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Andrea Bocelli's ""My Christmas"" is truly a wonderful Christmas show. There is such a warm Christmas feel throughout the entire concert. ""My Christmas"" is a instant classic that could become one of your families Christmas traditions.",1293580800,,232,5.472222222222222
3992873,5,B002UPA4ZY,"If you are reading this, you are already a fan of Andrea Bocelli's marvelous voice. I was pleasantly surprised to stumble across this DVD--I purchased the ""My Christmas"" CD when it first came out in 2009 (and have played it dozens of times during the past year), but since I do not watch television, I did not realize that Bocelli's excellent selection of Christmas-themed music was broadcast on PBS as a concert presentation (similar in content to his CD, but includes more music than the CD), produced by the incomparable David Foster.

The same outstanding level of musicianship, staging, video, and audio that went into the two previous Bocelli/Foster PBS-broadcast concerts (one at Lake Las Vegas (""Under the Desert Sky"") and the other in Italy (""Live in Tuscany""), and both released on DVD--the Tuscany concert is also available on Blu-ray Disc) are evident in this wonderful Christmas concert.  Again, Bocelli performs duets with some of the greatest names in the music world, including Natalie Cole, Reba McEntire, and even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Bocelli sings effortlessly in Italian ,English, French, and even German. There is even a surprisingly entertaining ""Jingle Bells"" segement with the Muppets--very amusing (it successfully avoids being overly cute)! The accompanying orchestra is simply breathtaking, simply a joy to see and hear. There are also several excellent choral groups that further enhance and add variety to the concert. There are numerous set/costume changes to keep things interesting.

But the video and the audio--WOW!  I almost did not purchase this concert, because it was only a DVD--I have been spoiled by the excellent video/audio that one comes to expect from high definition transfers.  Since there is no current Blu-ray release planned for this concert (as of Dec. 15 2010),  I decided to take a risk and buy it.  Yes--it is somewhat pricey for a DVD--but it is worth every penny. I have a 55-inch Samsung 3-D ready, LED (240 Hz) high definition television (and played on a higher-end Samsung Blu-ray Disc player) and I am very picky about the video quality of what I view.

I could not believe that I was viewing ""only a DVD""--the transfer and the ""up-conversion"" offered by my Blu-ray player are absolutely flawless! The level of detail was surprising--I could see every whisker on Bocelli's face and the textures of the Christmas trees and the musical instuments were razor sharp. The whites in the snow (in the ""White Christmas"" scence) and the black levels were perfect. My surround-sound system also got a good workout. If you are balking at purchasing this concert (like I was) because you are uncertain of the video/audio quality--you have nothing to worry about.  A future Blu-ray version of this concert will likely sharpen things up a bit--but not by much, since the DVD already looks and sounds so good. You will not be disappointed. I bought this concert two weeks ago and my family and I have already watched it three times. It is already a classic at my house.

Also, there is a 30-minute (or so) ""making of"" bonus extra that is quite interesting. Included are interviews with all of the performers (including David Foster and the various choral groups), and some of the fun that the performers had with each other and the audience (the concert took place at the beautiful and cavernous Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles) during the production/staging of the concert. The concert was not broadcast live due to the numerous set & costume changes. Highly recommended concert!",1292371200,12,3530,5.018803418803419

The selection of songs was good in that it had variety. The stage settings, creates a wonderful sense of christmas, and presentation was in keeping with the dignity of christmas while being entertaining. The ladies were charming. The voices of Andrea Bocelli and the guest stars are so good, true, rich, fulfilling and rewarding to listen to. For some undentifiable reason I like ""What child is this "" best in the performance and I have never seen a parralell to your presentation of ""Jingle Bells""

The children singing was different, nice ~ but not what I was thinking.  A lot of stage changes throughout that were kind of nice but just not real life feel, had more of a ""staged"", if you will, feel .  This video did not capture me like his others. If you really want an awesome video of Andrea I suggest ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" filmed in Tuscany.  Kenny G, Chris Botti, Ling Ling, and many more very tanlented artist.

3992885,1,B002UPA4ZY,"When you buy the more expensive CD, it says it includes the DVD of the TV special. When you get it, it is only 4 songs from that DVD. So now you have paid extra for the CD and you still have to go buy the DVD. So, because of Amazon's bad description of the CD, I have paid more by going to Amazon, instead of less.

The CD is great. Way better than watching it on TV with pledge week interruptions.",1265328000,6,398,3.8536585365853657

3992887,5,B002UPA4ZY,"This is one of the very best Christmas DVDs that I've had the pleasure of listening to.  I became addicted to Andrea Bocelli and David Foster -- their music is most definitely ""music to my ears!""  I not only listened to this DVD several times ... but even enjoyed it after the holidays, even in January of 2010.  I loved it so much that I bought several to give as gifts.  I also bought the CD and also gave those as gifts as well. With no reservation, I recommend highly ANY DVD and CD produced by David Foster and perfomed by Andrea Bocelli !!!  Hey, great music is great music and Andrea Bocelli and David Foster are the very best at what they do !!!",1264982400,,653,4.192
3992888,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Mr Bocelli recently (2009) appeared on the TV circuit over the holiday season promoting this CD. Those performances were, as is this CD, superb. Bocelli's voice is in the same league as the other great Italian tenors. Very enjoyable!",1264291200,,233,5.0
3992889,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Andrea Bochelli is my favorite singer and David Foster together in this DVD make it wonderful.  The duo with Natalie Cole, Reba, Katherine Jenkins and the Muppets are....wonerfuls.  The whole DVD
is perfect.",1263772800,,207,5.242424242424242
3992890,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Of course I love Andrea Bocelli and have most of his CD's. I have a collection of six Christmas CD's that I play during the holidays but this holiday there was only one that was played over and over. ""My Christmas"". I am still not tired of listening to it. I think Andrea and Foster had a blast making this CD. I really enjoyed the duet's and the pairing of Andrea with the children and the Muppets. If you saw the special, you can see the fun. My favorite selections are ""The Lord's Prayer""; ""Angels We Have Heard on High""; 'Adeste Fidelis'; and ""Cantique De Nol"". The entire CD is wonderful. If you enjoy listening to Bocelli, you can't miss with this CD.",1263081600,,657,4.349593495934959
3992891,5,B002UPA4ZY,We gave this DVD as gift on Christmas Eve. Every one wanted to watch it as soon as it was opened. Family members from 20 to 80 years old were glued to the screen during the entire show. Needless to say it was a hit.,1262995200,,215,3.8
3992892,3,B002UPA4ZY,"Great Christmas show but the DVD was only so-so because it was not recorded in Dolby 5.1.
Disappointing.",1262822400,2,104,4.833333333333333

3992894,5,B002UPA4ZY,"This DVD concert is the best I have seen, as far as Christmas is concerned. In fact, I will probably watch it throughout the year. Truly, one of Andrea Bocelli's esy work! Don't miss out!",1262131200,,187,4.371428571428571
3992895,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Without a doubt, My Christmas, is the best of the Christmas concerts! Andrea's voice is magical and David Foster is a genius with his arrangements and accompaniment. The stage setting was gorgeous and the gowns and tuxes confirmed the definition of Classy.

The musical guests blended nicely with his voice and the Morman Tabernacle Choir singing the Our Father was so very special for me as well as the Ave Maria. As an Elvis fan, I was glad Blue Christmas(one of my personal favorites) was included.  Even the Muppets evoked a smile and some chuckles with Jingle Bells - the slow then stepped up version. As I write I am smiling about the last comment.

Andrea's singing the favorite carols and ending with the most beloved of all - White Christmas - made for enjoyable viewing time and will, in my opinion, become a classic. I will be watching it over and over during the Christmas season and sharing it with my friends.",1261526400,,923,4.6503067484662575
3992896,5,B002UPA4ZY,Need a HD version!!!! I sometimes see the PBS show on HD and it drives me nuts watching this DVD. Yuck but I just have to suffer a bit.,1261440000,,135,3.689655172413793
3992897,5,B002UPA4ZY,"Magnificent!  Wonderful!  A truly moving experience!  Bocelli's voice and Foster's arrangements are marvelous.  Such a marriage of these two was made in Heaven.  I can see why some have negatively criticized the CD.  The sets, the colors, the whole ambiance--this is a performance that has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  The Lord's Prayer with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is otherworldly and takes your breath away.  A treat for adults and children alike.  The love just flows here.",1261180800,2,488,5.075949367088608
3992898,4,B002UPA4ZY,"I would give this 3.5 stars - Scrooge or Grinch that I am.  Christmas performances can have the tendency to have some hokey renditions of songs, and this is no exception.  I do not have the DVD, but I watched the entire PBS production and found some parts to be beneath Andrea Bocelli's dignity.  Most likely David Foster and Andrea were trying to appeal to all ages, but the performances with children and for children were hokey and boring and did not showcase Andrea Bocelli at all unless he was trying to show his versatiliy and humor.  The children were staged in the production - plastered smiles and all, or at least that is how I viewed them.  I also thought the Muppets were a real stretch.  Please leave this to Sesame Street.  Andrea's duet with Katherine Jenkins was not memorable. Katherine Jenkins is a beautiful woman (who was dressed in an over the top ball gown - sort of like a black mermaid costume), but her singing was not clear or emotional and the song was very bland.  Katherine Jenkins seemed to be merely there.  These are just of a few of the performances in the show.  Mary J. Blige (even though she was being videocast from NYC) was excellent and a breath of fresh air.  All in all, it is a very uneven concert production and may be just fine for Christmas but not for any other time of the year. I would not recommend that you buy this is as a gift for anyone unless you really know that they won't mind some cheesy, corny performances mixed in with the more serious performances.  ""Jingle Bells"" and ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" are laughably bad.  Read the other reviews and you'll see that I am not alone in my opinon.

If you want to experience a David Foster concert production well worth your time, please buy the Blu-ray ""Hit Man - David Foster and Friends"".  It is an exciting and memorable PBS concert event that will be a winner for all seasons and stand the test of time.  Andrea Bocelli maintains his dignity and Katherine McPhee makes magic with him.",1261180800,2,1996,4.457300275482094
3992899,5,B002UPA4ZY,"I had been searching for a good blu-ray or DVD to share with some friends who will be coming over for a movie night.  It being near Christmas, I was looking for something seasonal with picture and sound quality that would shine on my new large screen TV and blu-ray player.  After much searching, I stumbled upon this one.  It is outstanding, heartwarming, simply marvelous!  My daughter, my wife, and I were in tears at some points, the music was so moving.  It has gotten us in the Christmas mood, finally!!

Andrea and David are a dynamic duo.  And the varied guests added just a special touch.

I have a Plasma TV (Panasonic G15 - 50"") that I purchased recently, and a blu-ray player (Panasonic DMP-BD60), hooked up to an aging surround sound receiver (Yamaha RX-V995) and speaker setup (Infinity main, center, & surrounds, and a Klipsch subwoofer) .  This DVD does very well on my system.  The picture quality is very good.  And the sound, equally so.  I was very pleased.  This is going to be a keeper, something my family and I will watch for many Christmases to come!

Oh!  BTW, the DVD arrived in just a few days, well before I expected it.  Great job Amazon!

I think I'll order a couple more to give as presents.",1260835200,3,1223,4.486363636363636
