3895958,5,B002BWD73M,"In 2006, anime production studio GONZO and AIC adapted Ryotoro Iwanaga's manga ""Pumpkin Scissors"" to a 24-episode anime series.

The series would be directed by popular 80's anime director Katsuhito Akiyama (""Sol Bianca"", ""Thundercats"", "" Gall Force"",""Bubblegum Crisis""), screenplay by Yuuji Hosono (""Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor"", ""Ray"" and ""Trinity Blood""), series composition by Atsuhiro Tomioka (""Samurai 7', ""Vandread"", ""Eat-Man"" and ""Berserk""), character designs by Chizuko Kusakabe (""Trouble Chocolate"") and mechanical designs by Shuichi Hara ( who worked on ""Armitage: Dual Matrix"" and ""Solty Rei"").

""Pumpkin Scissors"" takes place during a time where war has ravaged the country.  But a ceasefire has ended the war between the Royal Empire and the Republic of Frost.  But since the cease fire, the country is not in the best of shape.  The Empire is now plagued with starvation, crime, pestilence and even the soldiers have become bandits.

With corruption also residing in the ranks of the military, a division called Imperial Army State Section III was created.  Section III is also known as ""Pumpkin Scissors"".  A name given to the group by 2nd Lt. Alice L. Mavin.  As way of the pumpkin being the layers of corruptness being trimmed by the blade of a scissor.

The series focuses on the Section III team and their mission of helping people and eliminating the corruption in their own military but also helping the public in other areas who have suffered from corruption.

But within the Section III is a mysterious soldier named Corporal Oland who is a member of the secret anti-tank group known as ""The Invisible 9' who seems to get them out of a jam when the going gets tough.

Section III consists of the following individuals:

Captain Hunks - The commanding officer who is rather calm, always smoking and gives out the orders to the team.

2nd Lt. Alice L. Mavin - Leads the team on their missions and also a member of the royal family.  But is dedicated to her job and passionate about the goals of Section III.  Always hot tempered when angered, she carries a short sword.

Corporal Randel Oland - The mysterious soldier known for his height and his facial scars.  When things get tough for Section III, Oland turns on his blue lamp and becomes a member of the ""Invisible 9'.  A man who is vicious in battle and gets the job done with his 13mm anti-tank gun.  Able to take on massive hits and injuries while in this mode.  A secret military group of individuals that took on tanks.  Not much is known about the ""Invisible 9' but there members of the Section III accept him without asking any questions about his past.

Warrant Officer Martis - Graduated on the top of the Academy but transferred to Section III to uncover corruptness in his former unit.

Warrant Officer Oreldo - The playboy who seems more interested in drinking and women but the cool, clever and resourceful member of the group.

Sergeant Major Lili Stecchin - An aid to Captain Hunks who works in the office and is responsible for the dog named Mercury (the messenger for Section III).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Pumpkin Scissors"" is featured in 169 and for the most part, the animation and artistic backgrounds retain the quality you would expect from GONZO.  For the most part, the animation is action-based and the artistic backgrounds tend to reveal the war-torn country.  Character designs by Chizuko Kusakabe (""Trouble Chocolate"") and mechanical designs by Shuichi Hara ( who worked on ""Armitage: Dual Matrix"" and ""Solty Rei"") are well-done and it's a series that focuses on a core group of characters but features a lot of characters as the group tends to visit villages that are in need of help.

So, you see a lot of anguish and fears in the face of the commoners and of course during battle, the fight scenes are also well-done and enjoyable to watch.  But also striking are the violent imagery depicted on the animation and design of the characters of the ""Invisible 9' group.  Definitely cool character designs and artistic style.

As for audio, ""Pumpkin Scissors"" is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound and Japanese stereo.  Dialogue is clear and understandable through the front and center channels but with all the action, I was hoping to hear a more immersive soundtrack especially coming from the surrounds.  But the series is primarily front and center-channel driven and felt that my best setting was to set my receiver to all channels on stereo.

As for the voice acting, I watched the series in both English and Japanese and both feature solid voice acting.  The main difference is that the English version tends to change a few things in dialogue and also utilize more profanity and familiar Western terminology for the English dub.  Also, Oland sounds a bit more oafish in the English dub but in a way it does make sense. But for the most part, I felt that the voice acting was well done and enjoyed both vocal tracks.

Subtitles are only in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Pumpkin Scissors - The Complete Series"" comes with very few special features on disc 3 and disc 4 containing trailers for upcoming releases:

DISC 3:

  * Textless Opening and Ending Themes

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Pumpkin Scissors"" is definitely an anime that people shouldn't judge by its DVD cover. Or even its name. I suppose I was a bit skeptical with the references to a pumpkin and scissors on the cover did not exactly generate any enthusiasm on my part but after watching the entire series, I can tell you that the series is definitely exciting, clever and for the most part, highly entertaining!

I enjoy the series because the ""PUMPKIN SCISSORS"" are always looked at as an underdog military/intelligence group that is not too important to the empire.  But the group shows its strength by tackling corruption and accomplishing missions which are not easy by any means.

Lt. Alice L. Malvin is quite interesting because she is a daughter from a noble family but instead of living a life as a noble, she learns how fortunate she is to have food on her table but at the same time, because of her beliefs, she wants to see right with the people in the ravaged villages who feel that they have no voice when it comes to the Empire and Alice wants to be their voice and really wants to help people.

But what is interesting is that you see her character develop especially when you get to the final seven episodes.  She's a changed person and her beliefs start to change.

""Pumpkin Scissors"" also shows the side of post-war and how villages all over have been destroyed or people left to die by starvation and sickness.  It was really good to see how animators captured the anguish of those who are suffering.

I did feel that the humor at times felt a bit kooky especially when you enjoy the violence and the action sequences for the series and some episodes go from dark but then you'll have a character like Oreldo flirting with a woman or cracking a joke.

But I really like the characters in the series. Anna has a pure heart of wanting to help the people, as does the corporal who despite seems to be lost because all he did was kill the enemies during the war and now that there is no war, trying to evaluate what peace is about and also trying to figure out his existence and his part of being in a group like Section III.

The show also does a great job in focusing on character development and granted there are not many characters on the Section III team, but you see each and every one of them overcome adversity someway and also with the help of each other.

An enjoyable series that is full of action, intrigue and suspense. A good balance of violence and a touch of zany and kooky humor.  From start to finish, you'll find yourself feeling that ""Pumpkin Scissors"" is indeed a hidden gem amongst many anime titles being released right now.  But it's a series that is worth checking out.

I highly recommend ""Pumpkin Scissors - The Complete Series""!",1251244800,39,11896,4.5385700846660395
3895959,4,B002BWD73M,"Every now and then there comes along an anime title that makes even the most open-minded individual pause and think surely this one has to be a case of mistranslation.  Such is the case with Pumpkin Scissors; a show with a title that seems made up of two completely unrelated nouns.  I mean could have it worked just as well if it were called Zucchini Shears, Squash Clippers, or Cucumber Nose Hair Trimmers?  Guess we'll never know but who cares?  The fact is, as indicated by the insignias on the character's uniforms, Pumpkin Scissors was indeed an intentional collaboration of symbols used to identify a certain military brigade within a surprisingly rich tale.

This anime release represents but another gem created by Gonzo that Funimation wisely picked up in their collaborative deal with ADV Films.  Labeling this specific release The Complete Series, it contains episodes 1-24 of the show across 4 dvds.  Packaged within a pair of thin packs (each holding two discs) within a very nicely decorated cardboard sleeve, the total runtime comes in at 600 minutes-even.

The show wears an appropriate TV 14 rating due to its grandiose themes of violence and militaristic operatives.  There is no nudity or particularly offensive language, and some sequences, though violent in nature, seem to avoid indulging in gore.

Language options consist of both the original Japanese dialog track (stereo) or English dub (Dolby 5.1 Surround) and the choice of English subtitles for either vocal track.

Extras are limited to texless songs and two crops of Funimation trailers.

The story goes something like this:  We pick up at the conclusion of a long and grueling war between the Empire and the Republic.  It's a period where a forced peace treaty struggles to find its footing and soldiers, who were accustomed to the thralls of battle, now find themselves on war relief duty in lands that have been ravaged by battle.

We follow the young female character Alice, an idealist heir to nobility and Second Lieutenant in Military Intelligence Section 3 (aka Pumpkin Scissors).  While she's expected to obey commands and do things ""by the book"", our protagonist makes it her own personal mission to fight for what's right, even if it means taking out rogue soldiers who refuse to follow the peace treaty or exposing corrupt, power-abusing nobles.

The show is an interesting blend of action and strategy and its pacing makes no apologies for failing to favor one element over the other.  The themes are quite ambitious, some might even say too ambitious, but the major story arc is broken up pretty evenly by the minor day to day trials and tribulations of the characters involved.  Credit is definitely due to the show's artists and production teams for managing to combine bright, clean visuals and cutesy moments with an underlying sense of ominous that builds without drawing too much attention to itself.  Comic relief is sprinkled about to break up the potential monotony of what boils down to a brash female soldier who decides to reveal the corruption of the power-crazed nobles who dictate her society.

In the end, a whole plethora of minor battles and grand conflicts serve as the catalyst to reveal the mysteries surrounding a covered-up super soldier program (kind of like a bunch of Captain Americas with eerie lanterns) known as the Invisible Nine.

This is one of few shows out there that can genuinely boast the ability to appeal to a pretty broad fan base.  Some will find attraction to the military-themes, antiquated technology, and action sequences while others will just as successfully cling to the character development of the interesting and likable cast.  Finally, there could just as likely be a devotion to the visual style and crisp animation presented here as it's definitely got the type of class that Gonzo seemed to be able to extract time and time again in their works.

The vocal tracks are just about equally solid in either language option.  One would suspect that the depth of talent in the Japanese track would overshadow the efforts of the English dub but the fact is that each take of the script has its own merit.  Occasionally it even sounds as though the English actors may have had a little more fun getting into the characters than their Japanese counterpart!

In all, Pumpkin Scissors could very well earn the award for the strangest anime title to reach our shores but the material itself is solid enough to warrant serious consideration.  Some may argue that the pacing is just a tad bit inconsistent and sure, there are episodes that tend to drag on with little overall plot progression, but in the end a rich story is cleverly weaved here through a group of honest characters unwilling to accept a corrupt society.  A majority of the bits and tangents that pop up along the way ultimately lead to a satisfying conclusion that's worth the effort of following along (even if little of what's happening makes sense at the time).  Multiple viewings reveal subtle overlooked details that slipped past the first few times through.  In all, a definite winner that will surely spend very little time collecting dust on a shelf.",1250294400,20,5163,4.91926182237601
3895971,5,B002BWD73M,My husband and I love this series. We were watching it on Netflix but it went off so I bought it. If you like this series you will also like Black Lagoon and Helsing.,1419379200,,166,3.911764705882353
3895972,4,B002BWD73M,"This is a Opinion based review.

I started watching this show in Japanese with subtitles and I have to say, the dub is alright. At first I was un sure how I was going to feel in the long run, but it grew on me and I ended up liking the show and the characters. I do like the idea of war relief in the show. Its a rather different take on anime. The only thing is, its another anti war anime. Don't get me wrong, I extremely dislike war. But this is a common thing in anime that involve war or combat of this nature. A good example is a show called Jormungand(great show).

Now the animation I would say is pretty decent. You can tell where the money went in some episodes and where the money didn't go. A good example is a scene where the Lieutenant(MC) is fighting a group of soldiers. You can tell some time went into that scene.

Character development is actually pretty strong in my opinion, a lot is left with holes because the show abrutly ends. There in the end is the problem. There is no 2nd season, so watch the show and expect nothing to finish.",1418428800,,1056,4.1414634146341465
3895973,5,B002BWD73M,A really good anime. This is one for true anime fans that like a good story with laughs and drama.,1390435200,,98,3.95
3895974,4,B002BWD73M,"there are war story anime, there are anime about peace time.  this is an anime about what happen in between war and peace, a story about a country that last a war, and are in the road to recovery.  It talk about social difference, shell-shock solder and the poverty that ppl have to endure after all their money is use for the war.  the opening for this anime was it main attraction, cause it draw me in after the first episode. character is interesting, we have the idealistic princess who the camera follow the most time, the lady man, nerd, and Corporal Randel Oland.  why is one of them decerve their whole name mention, cause he damn right deserve it, cause the story would have been better if he was follow more by the camera.  he are ur definition of a gentle giant, he kind, and gentle, but also a former soldier of the war, where his job is to kill tank on foot......no i didn't mistype that last statement.  the graphic of this anime is pretty ok, slow at most part, and the gun fight are meh at best, until Oland get moving that is lol.  the dub for this anime is unfortunally suffering, i watch normally prefer dub, but unfortunally the some actor for this show feel uncomfortable in their own skin, even Oland. the better voice actor, are the idealistic princess (that blonde one on the cover)  where the show think is main character, but really is not, it should have been Oland.
regardless of it flaw, u should check this show a try, if nothing else to watch Oland kill tank on foot, and the opening",1387411200,,1514,4.382142857142857
3895975,4,B002BWD73M,"One of my favorites - truly a great show.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the ending. It leaves us wanting more & honestly, should have had another season. But those are often the breaks with anime and it doesn't stop the show from being good regardless.",1380758400,,265,4.3
3895976,4,B002BWD73M,Lots of interesting characters and a bit off beat from the average 'military' anime.  The dub quality is even pretty good.,1366588800,,122,4.809523809523809
3895977,5,B002BWD73M,"I have been looking for Pumpkin Scissors as an entire series for a year now, ever since I saw parts of it online and found all but one part on individual DVDs. Next to Soul Eater, Last Exile, and FMA Brotherhood, this is a favorite... okay, there is also TriGun and all four Slayers series. This has complete characters, a mysterious plot, and a strong uplifting message. I liek the setting, a sort of post-World War One- feeling time period. I only wish the series would go into a second season, since it leaves too much unresolved. That is not a fault of this anime, however, and I recommend it for high school age and over.",1361318400,,626,4.405172413793103
3895978,3,B002BWD73M,"Pumpkin Scissors' heroine is an army officer named Alice.  How she got to be an army officer is anybody's guess.  She has no knowledge of unit tactics.  Alice isn't a likeable heroine.  She thinks that everything that she does is a moral crusade and she preaches incessantly.  She is also temperamental and throws tantrums frequently.  She doesn't seem to have any social skills.  She's a Manga girl, but she doesn't have the characteristics that make Manga girls so attractive, such as Honoka in The Third.

For the first 10 episodes, Pumpkin Scissors doesn't seem to have any plot.  It meanders.  Starting at the 11th episode, it shuffles toward a vague termination that has many loose ends.  Pumpkin Scissors doesn't seem to have any purpose except to fill 26 episodes.

The animation is very good.  The colors are brilliant and the scenes are well detailed.  The characters move realistically.  Computer generated graphics are used to enhance some scenes.  The animation does help to compensate for Pumpkin Scissors' failings.

There is action and some of it is combat.  The combat episodes tend to be unrealistic because Alice is clueless about how to lead a squad.  She isn't a Desert Fox.

I usually don't comment about the music, but Pumpkin Scissors' opening and trailer songs are terrible and it's necessary to listen to them 26 times to make it through the series.

I think that Pumpkin Scissors was a good idea.  It doesn't have the usual mecha combat, Japanese robots or slithering aliens.  Unfortunately, its execution was flawed.  It's neither horrible nor great.  It falls in the middle.  I can't recommend it as a ""must buy"", but I don't think that it would be fair for me to say that you would be wasting your money if you buy it.  My advice is to approach Pumpkin Scissors cautiously and weigh its merits against its failings before buying it.

In case you were wondering, 'Toten sie' means 'Kill them' in German.",1359763200,,1932,4.825688073394495
3895979,3,B002BWD73M,"I picked this one up because it was a good deal on an entire series and I'm always up for adding to my collection. This title was an interesting watch. It had elements that were good, but could have been great and also had some content that was not necessarily that good but could have been worse. I am not going to review the storyline since I always skip over those reviews. But the premise of the story is related to post-war relief and class warfare. Mixed with the various cast of characters, most of which are character types you may have seen in many other anime, this evens out to be a decent watching experience. Not anything to write home about by any means, but definitely worth watching as a ""cool down series"" after finishing something more intense. A good, fun, but rather generic filler anime. If you enjoy watching just about anything at least once you will get a kick out of it. If you only go after the high quality, very well produced and written series with deep story lines and well rounded character development you may want to skip it because of the generic quality.",1350864000,,1089,4.477386934673367
3895980,4,B002BWD73M,"Pumpkin Scissors is the name of a military unit that servers as army intelligence. Lt. Malvin and her team expose corruption and try to save the empire from the darkness lurking behind the scenes. It has a very different type of vibe to it. It's almost ominous at times. The character Randel is one of the toughest dudes I've seen lately. I like this story and the characters in it.

I picked this one up at an FYE on vacation. I was going through their anime rack and this was the only thing I didn't already have. I'm glad I found it. It's pretty cool. The animation is pretty good and the characters are cool. I am not familiar with a lot of the voice actors though. It's not one of the better animes I've seen, but I think its worth 10 bucks. The action and mystery are enough to get ya through the night.",1350432000,,809,4.219354838709678
3895991,5,B002BWD73M,"This series was another one of those that I brought on a hunch. It was worth it but the ending leaves you sort of hanging. I really missed having all the bad guys get what's coming to them, but I can understand. The heroine is great. A real person. I found the whole series moved along fairly well and it is really worth getting. I'd buy it again.",1326412800,,347,4.117647058823529
3895992,4,B002BWD73M,"""Pumpkin Scissors"" is definitely an enjoyable anime.  One of the first question that a lot of people ask these days when purchasing anime is if there's fanservice.  Well, let me start by saying, ""No"".  This title attempts to draw people in by meaningful content rather than drawing from more ""carnal"" baiting.  That is something I really appreciated from this show.

Basically, this show is about a small military detachment dedicated to war relief.  They call themselves ""Pumpkin Scissors"" (it makes sense when you watch the anime).  In a post war world ravaged by the machinations of violence, their duty is to bring aid to where ever it's needed as rogue military factions from the losing side continue to fight.  Pumpkin Scissors is filled with lowlifes until their new commanding field officer steps in with a strong conviction in her mission to provide war relief.

So how is it?  It's not bad, but it's not particularly great.  The things I did love about it were the memorable characters and how they drew on a lot of social and moral themes.  They tackle it well and realistically...let alone positively.  They don't just say, ""the world is dark"" but they strive to make a better world.  The characters do grow a lot and I loved seeing how they changed...or even became stronger in their convictions...heroes are indeed heroes without having to be rebels.  It does get emotional at times, but is not without humor and laughter.  I did enjoy this series a lot.  But the only real problem I had with it was that the conclusion never really resolves.  ACTUALLY, it's more proper to say it ends at a cliffhanger.  This is definitely something that can be fixed with a good 2nd season.  But the fact is, you aren't really engaged in the main plot until a bit after the halfway point.  And they haven't really declared that they will do a 2nd season (though rumor has it it's being planned).  Still, it's a good series...just hope for a 2nd season to finish what they started :-)",1326240000,,1982,4.700581395348837

3895994,3,B002BWD73M,"Pumpkin Scissors is a title that falls under Funimations S.A.V.E anime program. This would have some people overlook it as a crappy title they just happen to have the license to, but it may actually be worth your time.

The main themes of Pumpkin Scissors revolve around the aftermath of war and the reconstruction of society. The main cast consists of an underfund military unit that's job is peace relief, who are suddenly joined up by an ex solider named Oland. Other themes of the show dive into what being human is, and the effect of different classes mingling after the brutality of war. That being said, the show has its upbeat moments and the characters all overall enjoyable. Plus, they have a cute dog in the main cast.

If any of that appeals to you, watch Pumpkin Scissors.",1309737600,,785,4.640287769784172
3895995,3,B002BWD73M,"First: I love Funimation for bringing good anime in inexpensive sets!  Bravo!

This series is only average in my opinion. It seems to borrow heavily from Full Metal Alchemist and other pseudo-European post war series.  As usual, I prefer the original Japanese voice acting to the English dubbing (as with almost any foreign film or show). The characters are not quite as cheesy sounding in the Japanese.  But the lack of authentic, balanced, and likable characters it what does this series in.  As other reviews state: anime series often fall back on the stereotypical hero and villain molds.  This series is no exception.

But the series is entertaining and has a somewhat good story line, though nothing ground breaking.  I will say that I was impressed with the quality of the animation, especially in some of the more dramatic skirmish scenes.  And a couple of the supporting characters are fun (Orledo and the Duke 'wanna be Alice's fiance' guy).

Overall I enjoyed it and wasn't too put out that I spent $13 for it; but it will likely sit next to my copy of Gasaraki and collect dust.

3895997,3,B002BWD73M,"Pumpkin Scissors tells the tail of war's aftermath. A fictional empire, similar in some respects to post World War 1 Germany, has to deal with the massive disruption and damage after a terrible war. In the aftermath, there is widespread destruction, social unrest, and crippling poverty, made worse by corruption and evil dealings at the top of the damaged social structure.
The hero of our tale is Alice Malvin, a high ranking noble-person turned idealistic army officer, leading a team originally assigned to war relief, but increasing finding itself fighting the corrupt system. Along the way, they encounter Randel Oland, a hulking but gentle giant of a man with a terrible secret related to the war, and the lengths to which it was fought. The result is a story of intrigue, double dealing, and mayhem, with our heros braving both long odds, and the dirty bureaucracy.
I did enjoy this story quite a bit. It was quite nicely paced, and the characters were very interesting. If I had any complaints about this show, it was with our young heroine. She was at times just too good at what she did, and too high minded. That wouldn't be a problem in and of itself, but her idealism and extreme heroism made the ending excruciating as every challenge had to be met and every moral conundrum had to be explained and faced down. It all made sense in the end, and you still came away with great respect for our heroine, but give me a break. No one's that blasted perfect.
There are good things happening here, and certainly plenty of material for a second season, but there are some problems. I guess I can sum up my feelings by addressing Alice herself. She is amazing, much like her series, but I can't relate to her very well. In the end, much as one would expect in real life, this girl is just too far above my paygrade to make this relationship work.",1279670400,4,1852,4.598187311178248
3895998,2,B002BWD73M,"This retrofuture military anime (an alternate Europe post-WWI 1920s) begins well with a Kaname Chidori-like strong female character commanding a group of military misfits in some interesting missions.  They then stumble onto Hilary Clinton's ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" and the plot takes some FULL METAL ALCHEMIST type plot turns.  By episode 18 it looks like this will really be a good anime.  Then (apparently) the director decided not to complete the story and wait for a second season.  The plot just stops and disc 4 contains 6 episodes of the longest, most drawn out, most boring ""boss battles"" (with a very minor boss) in living memory.  What a waste!",1272499200,7,660,5.074074074074074
3895999,5,B002BWD73M,"Enjoyed the characters and plot development immensely. HOWEVER it truly seems to end at a SEASON end, with no story wrap up what so ever. Therefore, while the 'story' thread that ends is satisfying, there's no attempt to 'finish' the whole story as it was clearly still in process. It's not a bad wrap up. There IS no wrap up.

I'd hate to say don't see it. It was worth the watch. Just be prepared to be angry that you'll have to dig for the manga to see what happens next.

Makes me sad that there are some truly crappy animes out there that have had a much longer run. This one was well worth at least one more season. Sigh.",1270944000,12,627,4.1735537190082646
3896000,2,B002BWD73M,"This series had a lot of potential but Gonzo throws it all away. The series *ends* with a story arc that just begins to get interesting. But, without enough time to wrap things up, the series ends with a long, boring, multi-episode, diatribe on class warfare. It's painfully obvious they dragged things out just to fill out the season. And because of all of the mistakes made along the way, the series didn't do well enough for a second season, so the interesting story arc is forever left unfinished. This series brought painful, repressed memories of Glass Fleet back to mind, especially near the end when the class warfare becomes more prominent. At least Pumpkin Scissors has it's moments, but any series that can be compared to Glass Fleet probably isn't worth watching. It's a real shame Gonzo didn't go with a tighter story arc and wrap things up in one season because that could have worked. What they did release doesn't work, especially at the end.",1270512000,8,958,4.74251497005988

The only problem I encountered was the case that the series came in. I had ordered seven complete series and out of all of them this was the only one that looked crushed and it wasn't on shipment. Upon further opening and inspection, I found that cardboard cover seemed crushed slightly, and one of the plastic sleeves was also damaged, preventing DVD case from closing. DVD's are fine, no scratches at all!, but presentation is slightly ruined because of crushing.",1465084800,,614,4.694444444444445

8362063,5,B002BWD73M,"It was brand new, or like new and I enjoyed every minute of the show. Well worth the wait as I had to do so until they had some more DVDs in stock.
The show is much like that of other war related ones with much of the backlash rebuilding can bring. Unfortunately, since the manga was never finished, the series has a slightly less than wonderful ending, owing more towards not knowing where to go without ruining the manga than anything.
Although it was cut short, I still enjoyed it immensely and will continue to do so over the years.",1441670400,,536,4.316831683168317

8362066,4,B002BWD73M,"Portions of this series seem a bit silly and contrived. They just do. It's an unfortunate pitfall of a great amount of anime. Other portions jump straight out of the screen and go for a major artery. And therein is the joy of Pumpkin Scissors. Sure, it packs plenty of goofy stuff and comedic relief, but it also reaches deep into dark places that make people uncomfortable, or flat out hurt. And it does so with grace and sincerity. It manages to tackle a lot of very ugly issues of the real world, but takes just enough edge off that it doesn't maim, but it may leave a mark. It did for me. My hope is that it brings enjoyment, and some heartache for you too.",1435881600,,661,4.253968253968254
