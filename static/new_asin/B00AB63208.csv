8549673,5,B00AB63208,"A very interesting film about a very interesting and underrated writer. This film actually, contrary to what one review claims here, contains numerous new insights about Maugham's private and artistic life. The inclusion of interviews from Maugham's grandchildren shed new light on Maugham's controversial latter years. The film also offers insight on Maugham's techniques as a writer,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alexander-McCall-Smith/dp/B001BOPZXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alexander McCall Smith</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pico-Iyer/dp/B004MRADBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pico Iyer</a>&nbsp;offer poignant insights into Maugham's use of real life as an inspiration.

I appreciated that Revealing Mr. Maugham made it very clear that Somerset Maugham is still of interest today to readers, from Japanese book clubs to Facebook fan pages - Maugham retains a massive readership of people of all ages and backgrounds. The controversy relating to Maugham's sexuality is, again contrary to a review here, dealt with very honestly in this documentary. Maugham was clearly gay, he lived his entire life with men as lovers and had one great love in his life - who was a man, to ignore these facts would be absurd and thankfully Revealing Mr. Maugham does not ignore this aspect of Maugham's life.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Armistead-Maupin/dp/B004N75MHM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Armistead Maupin</a>&nbsp;offers very engaging insight into how being gay effects a writer while discussing Somerset Maugham in this film. The film made me realise I've read only a small amount of Maugham's work and has inspired me to delve deeper into Maugham's oeuvre, which is just what a film about writer should do.",1489968000,,2337,7.034364261168385
8549674,5,B00AB63208,A very  well documented review of  a most  interesting writer. The information about his childhood probably had an impact in his work.,1383004800,,134,5.0
8549675,5,B00AB63208,"Although I haven't read any Maugham (yet!) - I still have been exposed to his work without knowing it. Much of his work became the basis for screenplays e.g. If you have seen Bette Davis' atrocious Cockney accent in Of human bondage (1934), or Joan Crawford in Rain (1932) then you've seen a screenplay of his novels. Actually a lot of Hollywood connections  - Marilyn Monroe might have appeared in a 3rd version of Of Human Bondage had she live a bit longer. That would have been something to see. It seems he was a master of depicting sexual jealousy. Who wouldn't be interested after knowing that? A life full of intrigue (he worked for British intelligence), great fame and wealth,  and betrayal (both by him and others).",1362960000,,725,4.65625
8549676,2,B00AB63208,"Revealing Mr. Maugham (2012) is the new documentary on W. Somerset Maugham directed by Michael House. One can buy it through Amazon by requesting a copy (either PAL or NTSC) made.

Honestly, I wasn't expecting too much of it because so far biographies about Maugham have not been too successful. I attribute this to the fact that Maugham writes so much better about himself that it leaves other people's efforts pale in front of his Summing Up (1938), A Writer's Notebook (1949), or the semi-autobiographical Of Human Bondage (1915).

The description on the back of the DVD case reads: ""For the first time the full story is told of one misunderstood & influential Gay writers..."" It puzzles me immensely what was in the mind of the person when he/she was writing this. I think it is very likely that Maugham would reject the label ""gay writer."" In the age of gossips and invasion of private space, his homosexuality swells into an exaggerated importance that distracts the reader from his work and his masterful narrative skills.

I would take the ""influential"" but I am not quite sure what ""misunderstood"" is referring to. I guess it has to do with the fact that Maugham fails to become a literary canon, the famous ""Class Two, Division One."" However, the documentary does not seem to try to reinstate him either; if it does, a few praises from a bunch of so called ""best-selling authors"" are surely poor arguments. I would try not to assume that ""misunderstood"" simply goes with ""gay.""

Let's look at the above claim. ""Full story"" is incomprehensible upon finishing watching the documentary. Except the little anecdotes told by Maugham's grandchildren (by the way, those short interviews are the only watchable parts), none of the people know Maugham personally or intimately (except maybe Anthony Curtis who is a Maugham scholar), nor does what they say reveal anything about Maugham. Virtually nothing new has been added by the narration of Maugham's life by his most recent biographer Selina Hastings. The  interviews with an arbitrary selection of authors and a high profile Maugham collector are like sharing in a book club evening session. They shed no insight about Maugham as a writer or a person. When it is supposed to ""reveal"" Maugham, it serves more as a platform for these authors to talk about themselves, which, for me, is completely uninteresting, nor, I assume, for those who buy this because of their interest in Maugham.

Besides the interviews, the rest is filled with familiar photos of Maugham and clips of film adaptations of his novels.

Since there is no ""full story,"" the ""first time"" is invalid. When I was buying it from Amazon, I noticed that it was also sold with an educational license for US$145. I wonder where the educational aspect of this documentary lies. The library funds would be better invested in something else.",1362700800,7,2856,4.912863070539419
