2065423,1,B00027SIUK,"It's not enough that I have to hear ""remixes"" of classic rock on the radio. Now I have to put up with remakes of the great classic horror flicks!  Let's have remakes of The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds while we're at it.  How about Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, The Wizard of Oz, etc.  How about All Quiet... Oh, that's right, they did that. Never mind.  Beam me up Scotty. There's no intelligent life down here.
P.S. This hasn't been released. I only put a rating down because I had to. Who knows? Maybe it will be good (and pigs can fly).",1071878400,7,561,4.166666666666667
2065424,5,B00027SIUK,"I think people should give it a chance. I mean its better to try something new rather than not. What I mean is if it is stupid then we can complain about it and on the off chance its fabulous, then we have a great movie to watch! I mean zombie movies are my favourites, the more the merrier!!",1071187200,6,292,3.9661016949152543
2065425,1,B00027SIUK,"This remake never should happen. I am tired of untalented producers and directors ripping off the classic movies and remaking them. Why cant you guys come up with your own ideas? Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror movies of all time, and it will now probably be tarnished by this soon to be piece-o-crap. I usually would never say anything about a movie before I saw it, but I am just getting tired of my favorite movies being remade so horribly. Why would you hire the writer of Scooby Do to write Dawn of the Dead?",1069459200,15,524,4.25

Ving was brilliant in this movie an the power house of the group. The story line was perfect an the zombies were great. So glad they re released this on blu ray wit more an new features. A must have if your a walking dead fan or zombie movie fan because this movie is flat out supurb an was ahead of it's time when it came out in 2004.,1512172800,,458,3.989130434782609
2065441,5,B00027SIUK,"Dont listen to any idiots bashing this movie, it is one of the best zombie movies ever made!!!!!  Zack Snyder directed this masterpiece, and it ranks in the upper echelon of all-time great zombie / apocalyptic movies ever made!  It features Ving rhames (might have spelled his name wrong), who does a superb job in his roll, as does the entire cast.  This movie, in addition to being chock full of cool zombie action sequences, also has excellent character development, and basically, is a very high quality zombie movie, with no feeling of being produced on a budget.  I wish snyder made more of these zombie movies, and I wish Ving Rhames was used in additional zombie movies more often, other than a bit part in ""Day of the Dead"", which was also a super-cool movie!!!  In closing this review, here is another idea for a great zombie movie / cast-  how about ""The Expendables 5"" where they battle Zombies in an ""end of the world"" type scenario?  Any thoughts or comments on my suggestion?",1512086400,,990,4.622857142857143

2065463,4,B00027SIUK,"The last few months I have been taking a break from my normal DVD fare and watching Space Things, Haunted House things, and similar films of a type that I haven't seen since the old days of double feature movies with newsreel, short subjects and previews, 3 1/2 hours of black and white (mostly) film. What about this Zombie stuff ? ( I omit the movies starring Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard or Gene Wilder.) Early on I saw the first couple of seasons of The Walking Dead (just got the third). I did not like the gore but found it quite involving despite that limitation. Since then, I have watched one and another, tonight this one. I liked it. Not one for which I would vote to win an Academy Award, but retaining my interest throughout. Not one which strikes new ground, so far as I can tell, but I am not sure what the old ground looked like back when it was made.
That's about it. Speaking only to the older audience of which I am a part, if you can stand the gushing blood, not thrust in your face TOO often, it is a nice thriller. No room for good acting but it is good enough for what has to be done. No message except that it might be a good idea to stay out of Malls when the next Zombie attack takes place.",1504224000,,1217,4.139240506329114

2065516,3,B00027SIUK,"What a ton of flaws.  The last 15 minutes was such a chopped up no-continuity mess.  Characters suddenly stupid after being a clear thinker earlier....all kinds of frustrations and almost zero fright.  Casting stunk.  Way way too many characters and story lines.  Way too much time spent on stories that did not advance plot.  Actions were poorly ""faked.""  Don't make me list the issues.  I should give it two stars, except there was some good acting in the beginning with decent writing and production values, but even then it was slow.....despite the zombie scenes.  The driver speeding for no reason troupe was repeated many times and it just angered me so deeply that I was supposed to suspend disbelief for such fictional stupidity.....that the whole film deserved to be chucked.

I supposed any zombie film fan has to see this, but don't expect it to hit the target -- though it delivers every traditional scare-flick meme and does it well....it just never clicks.

I end here lest I get riled up enough to say it's a two star film.

7-1-17 Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd, I bought it not remembering having seen it.  Return karma, it seems.  I agree with the above but found more value in the film as I tried to remember it ahead of itself and that proved entertaining.  Sigh......shudda checked.....gawd.  I still won't give it four stars, but it's a very good three star film.",1489276800,,1380,4.808510638297872

This has got to be one of the better zombiefied movies of all time.  Ving Rhames shows his acting skills by kicking some zombie but and taking no names of course. Sarah Polley is cute, but shows us that ""cute"" don't cut it in a zombie filled world.
  This version of Dawn of the Dead throws you right away into the action and bloody gore that makes any great zombie flick worth watching. This is not the first time I have seen this version of DAWN OF THE DEAD, but it is my first review of it here on Amazon. Buy it, and enjoy it...............over and over.

2065556,4,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead (2004) is a decent remake of the George A. Romero film from the late 1970s. If you like lots of gore and violence (and at a much faster pace), then this film is for you. I have a few issues with it: First of all, was a remake really necessary? Of course I can answer this question from Hollywood's point of view ($$$$$). Second, I think there was a deliberate attempt to make this film much faster than the late 70s film, as a reflection of a sped up society. Directors are fascinated with speed these days, along with CGI. There's the aesthetic component, as well as the pace element, while the plot takes a backseat. This film suffers a tad because the plot is on the thin side; it's as if Hollywood wants a mindless audience (an insult). True horror film aficionados will appreciate a solid plot over the dumbed-down modern day Hollywood mentality. Now, the good: I generally like this film, because its concept is exciting (zombies wreaking havoc on society and multiplying, and the fight for survival). Second, the acting is good, and the characters are believable. As for the product: I have the blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy. There are two discs (DVD of the Uncensored Director's Cut, and blu ray of the Unrated Director's Cut). You simply get more gore for your buck. There are numerous viewing features, such as Picture in Picture, and the usual behind the scenes footage, commentaries, etc. Dawn of the Dead is a worthy remake (but not necessary) of the 1970s classic, and is recommended for those who don't mind a different perspective of a film.",1477699200,,1569,4.667870036101083

2065643,5,B00027SIUK,"This is that rare thing, a remake of a classic that is actually good. It's not so much a remake as a reimagining, as the only real connections outside the title are the shopping mall setting and the basic scenario of the zombies. But even they have changed, as these are the ""fast"" type of zombies that can run you down and not the original Romero-style slow zombies who you have more of a chance against, and this in a film that Romero co-wrote and approved. I prefer the slow zombies, they're more eerie and fast zombies are essentially just crazed people, but for this film I'll make an exception because it's so good.

The opening is unforgettable as Ana, a nurse, goes home from her hospital shift to a quiet suburb and a loving husband only to find everything nightmarishly changed the next morning. What immediately follows is fast paced and horrific. She somehow makes it to a shopping mall with a few survivors and they, along with some mall security guards and a few more survivors try to make sense of what's happening and eventually come up with a plan. The acting is believable and the characters aren't just ciphers waiting to be chomped. There are surprise developments, shocks and room for a little comedy. Meanwhile the zombie mob is rapidly becoming a horde outside.

I know, zombies aren't real, but if it were to happen, it would be Romero's zombies & NOT this shock & awe version. What made me hate this movie SOOO much, is that this is a REMAKE of Romero's Dawn of the Dead, but they strayed VERY much from this COMPLETELY remaking the zombies in their own image. In my opinion, if that's the type of zombie they wanted to portray, they should've made an entirely new zombie film unrelated to Romero's films. But instead they decided to butcher a cult classic, and this pissed me off from the first zombie all the way through to the last. I would've loved this type of zombie movie if it would have not been affiliated with Romero or the Dead Series at all, then it would not have crapped all over one of the greatest cult films of all time.

2065666,3,B00027SIUK,"I'll admit I'm a bit biased when it comes to zombie movies. I prefer the old movies for their originality and innovation. I also like how the zombies move slow and are strong in numbers compared to the rage zombies. With the rage zombies its a whole different ball game. Only one of them can kill just about the whole cast and yet we have the whole crew going out into a crowd of 100,000 of them. Oh well, it's a different style, I just prefer the original concept. The bottom line when it comes to this remake is that while it maintains the same premise of the original, it's execution is very different.

Well first of all there's the rage zombies with a much more of a focus on action. But also there's a huge cast of characters and we don't really get to know anyone. There's a few character moments here and there but by the end of the movie you don't feel like you went on a journey with these people. When someone dies you just shrug your shoulders cause it's not that big of a deal. And honestly a movie with this kind of setup is in need of some solid and interesting characters. I liked some of them, but we didn't get to know them and they weren't that interesting. On top of that the sense of time seems to pass oddly in this movie. You never know how long they spend in the mall and it never feels very long or as if they are really living and surviving within it. It's just like their there for a little while and they leave. And boy was that ending bleak, I mean the whole movie was, but still. The action and pacing is good enough to keep you interested and you want to see how things play out but all in all it's just another remake that isn't as good as the original. And it doesn't really set itself apart in a positive and innovative way. 3/5.",1435795200,,1763,4.154970760233918

2065697,5,B00027SIUK,"This is one of those classic movies that all zombie movie fans should see. I recently saw this movie again. I see it many times before, but I never rated it. This movie came out way back in 2004 and it still better than some of the zombie flicks that come out today.

Dawn of the Dead is a remake of the original Dawn of the Dead movie. It tells a story about a group of survivors that go to the mall and live there because of the zombies outside. The mall is the closes and the safety place they know to go. The main characters are a nurse, a TV sales person, a cop, a former thief and his pregnant wife. They try to get along with these security guards that already inside. Things are rocky to say the least and the security guards are in control. Then, later on, more characters will arrive and live at the mall too. To things happen and now the group of survivors are in charge and lock up the security guards.

Now all there is too do is live their lives inside the mall. It seems like the group have lived at the mall for a long while before something happens, when the power runs out. Then, they have to get the power back on and after when one of them dies. The group starts thinking about leaving the mall because they do not want to die there and know that no help is coming for them.

They make up a plan to get out by taking these all tour vans and armoring them up. Then, they make weapons to prepare for fighting zombies when the day comes. They want to get to the marina, so that they can get a boat there to get to a island somewhere close by and hopefully there won't be too many zombies there to live.

And by fast I mean fast, the don't get tired, they are much stronger, with even a lone zombie being a very dangerous threat.  The characters are interesting and make me enjoy their time at the mall so I'm happy when they're having fun or when they're fighting for their lives.

2065707,5,B00027SIUK,"I really enjoyed this film, I thought it was better than George Romero's 1970's version which is a good movie itself.  I love the way the director filmed the movie. Going from suburban bliss to chaos the next morning.

The characters seem smart and realistic, not your typical airhead teenagers going off one by one into an isolated area to be slaughtered.  The zombies are terrifying similar to 28 Days Later.  I always thought the faster aggressive zombies were much scarier than the slow plodding ones.  You can identify and relate to the survivors in the mall and root for them.  I thought the film was definitely worth watching and would recommend it to any horror fan.  The director does not pull any punches and even main characters don't make it out alive.  I found that quality very realistic as what would happen in that instance.

I did think the people in the mall should have tried to find a RC airplane or car to try and get the gun toting hippy some food on the other side of the street, instead of using the dog.

This is the Director's Cut, which includes a lot more gore (if you like that) and a lot of bridging scenes which make the action a little less jerky and a little more (not too much) character backstory. The Director's Cut is usually the version to choose, and that's true for this DOTD edition as well.

2065755,4,B00027SIUK,"This is a decent zombie movie.  Although this is billed as a remake, there is very little left of the original story.  So, while it's good that it's not simply treading in the same footprints of its predecessor, it's just not as solid a story as the original.  Unlike the original, we really know very little about any of the characters, in fact we only know the backstory of one of them.  So, it's not really as big a deal when they die off since we never knew them anyway.  There are some nice touches, like the development of some kind of relationship between the group and the guy on the gun store roof, but other things, like the line from the original about why the zombies come to the mall, just fall flat because we don't ever see the zombies as having ever been human, as we did in the original.

The humor of the original is also jettisoned, in favor of more scare, which gives the audience less time to think about what they're seeing.  Here also, the story takes place over a much shorter span of time - a week or so, whereas the original focused on how the characters attempted to establish a sense of normalcy and control over their caged environment over a period of several months.

So, yeah, a decent film, but just not as much fun as the original.  Which is probably why I haven't watched it nearly as much.",1404432000,,1325,4.331983805668016

2065758,3,B00027SIUK,"this is where I discovered Sarah Polley and I've been a big fan ever since. I like the likable characters and scoffed at the oafs. Not really believable that the pregnant woman would've not been seen by the others in the mall, just poorly written. In these types of films, there's almost never a strong enough justification story-wise for the characters to abandon their safe haven, and yet they almost always do. I've never bought it though, even when seeing Night of the Living Dead as a child, I knew they should've stayed where they were - ""a bird in the hand....""  And in most subsequent re-tellings or re-imaginings most writers/directors have the characters leave their abode after they've secured it at great cost to life and limb. In such  a situation people would just not be so quick to leave a fortified location, given that they are surrounded by a hungry hoard. Be nice to have a writer update the story to be abit more realistic.",1401235200,,944,4.6467065868263475
2065759,3,B00027SIUK,"I can't believe that this remake is 10 years old, where did that decade go?? Anywho, I remember when they announced this remake, and I wasn't too thrilled with the idea. As a huge fan of Romero's original, I just didn't see how they would be able to capture the tone or feel of that film with a modern update.

Well, the good new (or bad news for some) is that they don't really try to emulate Romero's movie. As a matter of fact, outside of the basic premise of survivors taking up residence at the town mall during a zombie outbreak, there's very little in common between the original and the remake.

Sarah Polley plays Ana, an ER nurse who is barely able to escape from her now zombie infested neighborhood. Ana hooks up with several other survivors and they decide to head over to the mall to wait for help. Ving Rhames plays a police officer, and Jake Weber plays a Best Buy TV salesman with leadership instincts. Ty Burrell in pre-""Modern Family"" fame plays a cocky rich guy, and there are several other survivors sprinkled throughout. Honestly, so little time is spent with most of the characters, you will be hard pressed to come up with their names. Beyond the 3-4 main characters, character development sticks pretty much to the survivors' current circumstances; Man and pregnant wife, dying father and daughter, security guards, trucker lady etc. I'm with the survivors who manage to overcome some personality differences to work together, and even form a long-distance friendship with a survivalist stuck on top of a building across the street.

The zombies are just a faceless hoard, who seem to run much faster in death than most people can in life?!? I have to say I'm not a fan of ""fast zombies"", but they work in this movie. There are several really tense moments in the film as the zombies begin high-tailing it after our survivors. For some reason though, I still find the shambling, slower moving undead more frightening....but that's just personal opinion. For this film fast zombies work really well.

With that said, the characters make some pretty head scratchingly stupid decisions, I guess that's the case in quite a few horror films, but in the case of this film, the entire last half of the film is based on the characters deciding to leave the mall, this place with abundant food, supplies, weapons, and safety?? I'm never quite sold on the idea of why they would want to leave, except that they movie has to conclude with them hitting the road. I'm not a fan of spoilers, so won't go into any detail for those of you who haven't seen the film yet. It's just that you really have to turn off your brain for the second half of this movie.

Zombies have so overwhelmed the entertainment industry in the last decade, I hesitate to recommend this film to anyone currently over-saturated in undead tales, but I do think it's worth a view. I would almost say that this film helped usher in an era where we get ""The Walking Dead"" on TV, and new zombie films hitting theaters every couple of months.

It works to everyone's benefit when horror films cast `real' actors of considerable talent as opposed to those who don't rise above just being bait or a rudely awakened chew toy.  It also helped that I don't remember (and don't have) the original movie so I can't compare the two.  I accepted this one purely on what it delivered which was a fast paced thrill-fest of action.  Yes, some of the dialog was inane, and some of the actors weren't up to the challenge (does Ving Rhames really need to appear in practically every zombie movie, basically playing the same character?).

2065794,4,B00027SIUK,"Many were vehement against this remakes' birth. They were outraged to hear the news, but as the hour grew nearer, many grew more antsy to sample the stuff and see how pure it tasted. Dawn of the Dead 04' was a throwback/tribute to the original, taking liberties to change a few things, but keeping much the same. Savini himself even supported the movies conception, helping promote it at conventions. He stars as a cameo in one scene as well. With this backing, against all odds, people still went in with high trepidations and a huge chip on the shoulders.
I came in from another angle, of course. I'm not a rabid, drooling fan of the original, and was more open minded for a sequel. Having been disappointed numerous times in the past with cannibal and zombie offerings, I was all google eyed over finally, finally, being blown away. Was I here? Well, no, I didn't reach that ultimate orgasmic goal, but I was left pretty damned pleased regardless.

First of all, this movie doesn't shy away from violence and senseless gore. It paints a bloody picture that I was eager to appreciate. The kills are violent and filled with that all natural apple pie goodness. Even characters cared about bit the big one, and in horrid ways no less. The zombies themselves were also offered in clever ways. Detail is shown when they're heads get holed or blown away. I appreciated this violent mall massacre for what it was worth, and, it didn't have the cheesy looking effects the original did.

The acting was also as good as the first. It kind of hurt things they had more characters in the mix as it was harder to get emotionally tied with so many. On the other hand, it kind of helped as it offered more ghoulish plans to kill more people and in more inventive manners. Another big change was instead of getting zombies that slowly lumbered as if they were stoned out of their mind, here we get running ones that look like they're on the world's best speed. Both work well, so I have no prejudice here.

Sarah Polley as Ana held her own weight and shone in her role. A truly heroine, strong willed heroine if there ever was one.  Ving Rhames as the black cop aiming to save his brother owned the flick. He was stylish, controlled, and violent when need be. Jake Weber had the perfect talent (and look) for playing the more low key good guy. Mekhi Phifer as Andre convinced me he was a family man gone over the top. Ty Burrell excelled in his role, and actually had depth. Michael Kelly looked good playing the bad boy security guard, surprising me in a few scenes. His sarcastic humor was well appreciated. There were plenty more, and all were good. No bad seeds in this pot, Dawn of the Dead 04 sported a great cast that helped propel this little movie along....at high speed no less. I really enjoyed the addition of the barred up survivor across the street. Tear jerking.

For bad parts, Dawn of the Dead didn't really take a breather. It was almost non stop action, obviously aimed at the impatient MTV crowd. Not much social commentary was touched upon as a result. One of the best things about the original was the emphasis on American consumerism, and sadly they didn't choose to explore this at length this time around. Some of the dialogue was also too over the top and obviously a product of the decade. Only a horror film would dare to put comedy in bad situations. As an example, when CJ is discussing their plans to leave the mall and combat the zombies, they all have sarcastic replies that are supposed to be found amusing. I'm all for amusing scenes, but in dialogue it's a win/lose situation depending. Realism is needed here, and characters behaving like they're stand up comedians doesn't deliver.

 It would have also been cool if a little more time had been taken with exploring the pregnant woman and how it ended up. Such a great, dark, morbid little idea. Speaking of morbid little ideas, I loved the scene where they were playing 'find the celebrity' in the zombie pack. Hysterical.

The beginning is juicy as hell, with Ana waking up to see total chaos. The hubby attack scene on the lawn was hilarious. It all gets better from there, slowing down at a few stops in between. The ending is a bit of a letdown though. It just lacked glamour. It was what it was but not much more. They could have thought of ...err, I don't know, more a shocker or something. It needed extra spice to carry the bang the beginning had and top it.

Overall Dawn of the Dead is a remake I am glad was remade. It changed enough to work and modernized stuff, but not necessarily in a bad way. Sure, some things suffered a bit because it was so hyped up, like character development, but in other ways speeding things along helped created a bloodier salad than before. All great stuff. You can enjoy them both with betraying either.",1379635200,2,4821,4.519495412844036
2065795,5,B00027SIUK,"I first saw this version on the Sci-Fi Channel and nowhere else, which struck me as odd, but then again, odd things appear on the Sci-Fi Channel all the time--case in point, Sharknado anyone?  If you haven't seen this version of Dawn of the Dead, and you like anything zombie (who doesn't right?), then you WILL like this movie.  The only fault I'm willing to touch upon is the ending.  It's a little saddening.  By the time the movie concludes, you will be rooting for the characters and you want them to survive--ALL of them; especially because they worked so hard to.  You'll have to see the ending to know what happens--no spoilers from me.",1379462400,,644,4.565217391304348
2065796,3,B00027SIUK,This is one of the greatest remakes of all-time. Perhaps it is really one of few remakes that could even be compared to an original. This version is certainly one of the Top 10 Horror Films of the last decade. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is excellent but this remake shines. It is better than Snyder's Man of Steel and is very faithful to Romero's original vision. This is a 4-star film getting 2-discs in a 3-star package because all the extras are included in U-Control Picture in Picture Track (you can't access individual content like in the DVD). Many have complained there are no extras in the 2011 Blu-ray because of this and it is understandably annoying. Most but not all of the previous extras have been ported over (but other releases weren't exactly loaded with supplements either).

I didn't care about social commentary when I was 18.  I was young and loved zombies.  When I saw this movie in the theaters I didn't think, ""Crap, they screwed with Romero's classic.""  I thought,""Crap, if those were the zombies we were screwed.""  I liked the story, the characters were filling space and it basically was a bite out of a zombie outbreak.  Just one short story of some survivors.  It was well put together, there was tension and all in all it was a good film.  The beginning with Johnny Cash was a classic.

Now here's the scandal:  Gun store guy has probably 50,000+ rounds of ammo in his store. He has high powered rifles with really awesome scopes and he knows how to shoot really well.
Given those assets I would have that parking lot CLEARED OF THE WALKING DEAD within 48 hours, taking time to sleep. Then they all could simply waltz down to the docks. This bugs me each and every time I watch this film. Someday if I get angry enough about it, I may make my own remake of this classic. It will last all of 10 minutes, and end with a pile of zombies shot through the head in the mall parking lot, and the survivors high fiving and skipping down the street towards their secured futures.

What about this Zombie stuff ? (  I omit the movies starring Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard or Gene Wilder.) Early on I saw the first couple of seasons of The Walking Dead (just got the third). I did not like the gore but found it quite involving despite that limitation. Since then,  I have watched one and another, tonight this one. I liked it. Not one for which I would vote to win an Academy Award, but retaining my interest throughout. Not one which strikes new ground, so far as I can tell, but I am not sure what the old ground looked like back when it was made.
That's about it. Speaking only to the older audience of which I am a part, if you can stand the gushing blood, not thrust in your face TOO often, it is a nice thriller.

2065811,2,B00027SIUK,"Having never seen the original film I really didn't have any expectations while watching this. The plot revolves around a virus that turns people into zombies. The movie doesn't really delve into how the virus was brought about, or how it spreads so quickly, but it shows the outcome is zombies. Pretty basic formula.  The film then reveals the only way to kill the zombies is to shoot them in the head. This is also never explained, and is really one of the many downfalls of the movie. A regular person making a head shot on a moving target is impressive on it's own, let alone making continuous head shots through out the movie. Totally unrealistic, but I digress.

The main problem with this movie is character development. The characters are just plain uninteresting, and I never forged a connection with any of them. The only character that was semi interesting was a gun shop owner who had a fairly small role. All in all, this is brain dead slasher zombie film with over the top action scenes, and a plot full of holes.

2065819,5,B00027SIUK,"Ana awakens to a world that has been overrun by the undead, narrowly escaping the ravenous hordes by teaming up with a small band of survivors who have taken refuge in the local shopping mall. Zack Snyder gives DAWN OF THE DEAD a terrifying new update in his 2004 remake, changing the game of zombie cinema forever.

In an effort to make his villains even more frightening, Snyder allows the creatures to take off at top-speeds after our heroes. Now, we not only have to worry about the overwhelming numbers of the undead, but outrunning them as well! While this has become the source of much controversy with fans, it isn't as illogical as many make it out to be. The infection is only a day old when our movie begins, so the bodies of the deceased have had no chance to degenerate. If fueled by an insatiable bloodlust, it would only seem reasonable that these killing machines would attack with a primitive rage.

Our new set of heroes quickly garner our support, with Ving Rhames playing the tough policeman Kenneth, Sarah Polley as the sharp and resourceful Ana, and Jake Weber trying to hold things together as Michael. Each of the side characters are just as enjoyable as well, and help to create a dichotomy in personal politics that drives the internal conflict. The human element is great, but where the new DAWN OF THE DEAD succeeds most is in the scares. Synder creates many unexpected and exhilarating moments of adrenaline-pumping excitement, pitting his characters against insurmountable odds in the fight to survive. The zombies are like rabid dogs, bursting through doors and ripping their victims to shreds. It is a very horrifying experience, but one that also delivers on suspense as well as gore.

Regardless of one's feelings when it comes to the proper speed of a zombie, DAWN OF THE DEAD proves to be one of the strongest remakes in Horror to come out of the 2000's. It draws from Romero's basic premise, but creates something unique entirely that fans are sure to appreciate, but moreover, it is as scary as it is purely entertaining.

The new version is very much a re-imagining of the film. The zombies are faster, not the lumbering ghouls of old. There is possibly less slow-building tension and more racing horror but this re-make still ticks all the boxes.

Band of scared survivors - tick
Desperate stand in a shopping mall - tick
Stereotyped characters - tick
Plenty of gory zombie-action - tick

All the ingredients are there for a modern classic and that's what you get with this movie. The production is slick, the effects believable and the acting right on target.

There are some great twists in there, look out for the zombie baby. There are also some great characters such Andy stuck alone in the gun shop.

Romance and tension blossom in the Shopping Mall as the survivors realise that help is not coming and that they are on their own. It's a shame the raiders from the original didn't appear in this version but there are security guards to handle, basements to clear and some strange goings on in the baby department. You can add to this list converting a coach into a zombie-proof tank!

(still a classic though). but not so well here. The acting is fine  but the detail and social commentary is lost in this movie. It's  a higher budget movie but the filmakers just don't have the soul in the story the first version had.  Taken on it's own?  It's still average for a high budget horror movie. It's lost all the humor of the original though which is a shame. So it's a average horror movie. But running zombies , as in sprinting should be left for the return of the living dead series.

2065867,5,B00027SIUK,"George A. Romero is the modern godfather of zombie movies and his cinematography is no exception. In Dawn of the dead, the movie begins with a normal setting, as a nurse goes to work in the hospital and goes to home with her bf, only to wake up to complete chaos as the neighbors daughter infects her boyfriend and she barely escapes with her life and finds herself stranded off the highway by a shopping mall.

The best thing about this feature is that it accurately depicts how people deal with disaster situations. Some people give orders and take matters into their own hand to survive and others lose their cool and die. Romero quickly defines who is a survivor and who is going to die by making some characters as worthless and selfish, while others work as a team to survive.

In the end, nobody survives and this is a movie where humans go extinct, as the virus infects all the last people on the earth turning them to zombies hope is lost. As the power grid fails when nobody is there to maintain the power plants, the people in the mall are forced to use the emmergency generator, and eventually make their way out of the city, only to find that they have ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE to run. Romero depicts this as a ""disaster"" in the beginning with people unsure what is going on, and then it greatly hits epic proportions as all of the police, military, search and rescue operations are taken out and overrun and nobody is left alive. In the end, we see the end of civilization as the survivors finally reach an island and get overrun when they get off the boat.",1311811200,,1565,4.449477351916376
2065868,1,B00027SIUK,"The original Dawn of the Dead is witty, atmospheric, and (like most of Romero's films) subverts conventions in a thought provoking manner. It laces horror and bleak observations with anarchic fun.
This re-make is remarkable only in that it manages to suck all of the intelligence and humour out of the original. The regressive stereotypes and boring video-game action will appeal to those for whom a plot with ideas, and suggestion prove too challenging.",1311465600,2,454,5.148648648648648
2065869,4,B00027SIUK,"We all know that romero's film is a classic so I tried to watch this as a stand alone movie with bits borrowed from the original, and that's just what it is. The zombies are agressive and I'll never forget the little girl in the beginning hopping to her feet after being thrown down a hallway. SCARY! It made me feel like I was in for a wild ride, and I was!

If you feel Dawn should not have been remade, than give it another title in your head and view it as a stand alone zombie movie. All they really borrowed from the original was the shopping mall. Other than that, it's a very original movie. Lot's of action, lots of gore and some comedy as well. What more do you want in a zombie flick?

As for the Blu-ray release: What happened to the great bonus features that were on the DVD release? Also, this is the first time I have been let down by the picture quality of a Blu-ray. I have serious issues with the contrast. The whites are too white and the blacks are too black.

Best Blu-rays I've seen so far:

The Exorcist- There are some snowy scenes here, (it was shot in 1972/73). However they are few and far between. I've seen this movie over a hundred times and I've seen things on the Blu-ray that I'd never seen before. You really get to see how great the make-up was. Her eyes! My God! You see every little color in those eyes. Great 2 disc package with book. Stunning and I mean STUNNING bonus features. This is the ultimate Edition.

2001: A Space Odyssey- You'd think it was shot yeserday. Picture is crystal clear and sharp with vibrant colors. Great bonus features. A nice package.

2065872,4,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead is a 2004 remake of Romero's 1978 masterpiece and is directed by Zach Snyder.  The basic elements of zombies and a mall are really the only things held in common with the original.  (Unless you count the cameos.  They happen quickly, but will make you smile should you recognize them when they happen.)

Briefly, I thought this was a terrific new version and recommend you picking it up, especially if you're a collector of the genre.  Snyder's directing occasionally tips the film on its side to bring you a few neat little surprises that can turn your two hours into a worthwhile experience.  One of my favorite scenes was when Ana was fleeing the neighborhood in her car and ends up on a straight piece of road that falls away as the camera pulls skyward.  You're above her watching her drive when an extraordinary accident happens on the road that jars the process beautifully.  And this sort of thing happens often in the film.

For those that care, I should also mention that the gore was minimal, but the violence was rapid and frantic.  I felt that it was as tastefully done as one could expect considering the subject matter, if that makes any sense.  The directer didn't go for the gross out to compensate for a lack of substance in this movie and the result, to me, was satisfying.

The only gripe I have with the movie is that it erased what my mind had fabricated concerning the design of Milwaukee, and turned it into a city not unlike a sunny, lulling suburbia somewhere in California.  The only news I've heard of Milwaukee is bad news which typically isn't accompanied by media photos showing the city's finer weather and tourist destinations.  In fact ** SPOILER ALERT ** the crew ends up commandeering a boat which they navigate to an island.  An island.  Near Milwaukee.  I've not doubt such a place exists, but I deluded for some time about Dahmer wandering flaccidly as a teen the gray, bleak and lifeless landscape of a dying metropolis.  *sigh*  (While we're on the subject, how did they know which boat belonged to Steve?)  ** END OF SPOILER **

So, yes.  If you're a fan of undead cinema, I suggest you put this on your to-watch list.  Especially if you're also a fan of Richard Cheese, and I mean that.

Enjoy.

I look for one critical aspect: do the zombies scare me.  In this film, the anwser is yes.  The zombies are scarier looking and faster.  That part was truly believable when the zombies came to ""life"" at the beginning of the movie.  The problem I had with the film was that in the days following the initial zombie resurrection, they should have gotten slower not faster.  In the commentary and bonus material, the makers of the film talked about three stages of zombies: the fresh kills or newly dead, the dried up mid-range zombies and the juicy truly decomposing zombies.  By that last stage (short of superhuman strength), the zombies should have been slower and weaker.  The fastness of the zombies at the end of the movie could be explained by the fact that fresh zombie were made between the time the main characters hit the mall and they went to the boat.  Most people don't like to think that hard.
Most zombie films try to follow the zombie rules (somewhat following the George Romero rules).  I think people don't mind bending the rules, that helps create a new type of tension in the film.

This follows a group of people who hole up in a shopping mall after a Zombie outbreak and shows how they fight off the Zombies and their own tensions.

This has some decent zombie effects and boy can these guys move, much faster than I remember and more scary for a modern audience, I guess, than the shuffling creepy Zombies of old.  Ving Rhames is believable as a gruff cop and Mekhi Pfifer is good as a father who has to deliver his own baby under unusual circumstances.

This film manages to be both creepy and action packed in equal measures and is a worthy addition to the Zombie genre.  Don't compare it to the original and enjoy it in it's own right and this should provide ample entertainment for an evening.

Distributor: Universal (US)

How do you remake the best zombie movie ever made?

It was never going to be an easy task, the original Dawn of the Dead is not only widely considered as the best zombie movie ever put to celluloid, it is also widely regarded as one of the best horror movies period. In 2003 Zack Snyder took on the task and one year later released a remake which actually remains faithful to the original source but also enhances the experience to give us something new. Now, admittedly the remake was never going to better the original, that would be like expecting Starcrash to beat Star Wars to title of best sci-fi movie of all time, but this remake does actually have a lot going for it. We get an updated story, fast running zombies, original cast from the 1978 version of Dawn in cameo roles, tense action/horror sequences, a fair amount of blood and guts and a quick paced enjoyable interpretation of an all time classic.

Dawn of the Dead comes to Blu-ray from Universal Pictures on a region free disc. Although this release contains the unrated extended directors cut of the movie, it is worth noting that as with the previous US DVD release, it is also very slightly optically censored in a scene which involves a topless female zombie. As the zombie is approaching a victim in a car, a smear of digital blood has been added to the windscreen to protect the zombies modesty. Original US cinema prints and foreign DVD releases had the scene unaltered, however for some strange reason the US DVD and now the Blu-ray contain the digitally censored version. Considering the rest of the movie comprises of scenes which include gory death by chainsaw, biting and devouring of people, numerous bloody shootings and a truly horrific scene involving a baby, it would appear that the moral majority among us decided that a pair of naked zombie breasts was just one step too far. However, the shot lasts all of about 2 seconds in total, so unless you are desperate to see the breasts of an undead, it shouldn't spoil your viewing pleasure too much. As for the transfer itself, the 1080p wide-screen print is presented in a 2.35:1 ratio which displays strong colours and a good level of detail. There was however, some print damage or noise visible in a few indoor scenes, which for a relatively new movie came as rather unexpected.

Audio options for this Blu-ray release include an English 5.1 DTS HD track which is strong and bassy during the action scenes and generally lends a powerful atmosphere to the music throughout. On the downside, the actual dialogue seemed a little low at times compared to the rest of the soundtrack.

Extra features include a fun commentary track with the films director Zack Snyder who shares his respect for the original film with the listener, along with recounting various experiences on making his own version. Also included, is a picture in picture track which once selected allows you to watch various behind the scenes footage at various relevant points in the film. A real shame and in fact a huge flaw in this release, is that some of the extras from the previous DVD release including the full news reports, and the ""Andy's last days"" feature are unforgivably missing from this Blu-ray. To omit such quality extra features appears to be absolutely senseless and shows a real contempt for the movies many followers.

All things considered, this Blu-ray release is certainly flawed, however that being said, it may still be worth the upgrade for the improved audio and picture quality, that is, if you can live without the missing extras. Ultimately, the actual film itself is a lot better than it's Blu-ray release, which really could have been so much better with just a little more care and attention to detail.

One of the best modern day remakes of our time, for one of the best original horror classics of all time, really should have deserved to see a far better Blu-ray release from Universal.

One consolation is that the Blu-ray is overall still the best way to experience the film itself and it should be found at a fairly reasonable price on-line.

A must own for any horror fan . I bought this in a two pack with Land of the Dead another great movie. Dawn and Land can be found very cheap now and both are a steal for what Ive seen them selling for. If you want to buy a great horror movie pick this up .. Awesome ! ! !",1289001600,,354,3.6103896103896105
2065884,5,B00027SIUK,"I can't really compare this with the original version as I've not that in full yet, but of all the zombie films I've seen, this 2004 remake is definitely one of the best. I've seen this film 3 times now! It's exciting through out and creates a lot of suspence in many scenes even if you can predict what's going to happen. It's a bit like 28 Days Later with running zombies rather than slow, mindless zombies that can creep up on you from behind like with the Romero films. So more like the rage virus from 28 days Later only they're still undead rather than simply infected and they look like zombies as well, menacing, frightening and creepy giving an upper tempo to the film with a sense of emergency making the effort to keep them out of the mall much more intense. The only thing that I think could be improved about the living dead in this film is that everyone who dies from anything should come back as a zombie rather than just people who are bitten or infected, it would make it more exciting. Brilliant acting as well and a good wide variety of characters and although there isn't whole lot of character development, there are so many different characters - a strong police seargent, a tough, bitter security guard with a cowboy moustache, a sarcastic guy, a jack-of-all trades, a former criminal with his pregnant wife, and then there's the nurse who's the love interest. So like I said there's a wide variety of characters which I think again makes it more exciting because the higher the number of characters the more action filled zombie scenes you're going to see because any of them can be confronted by a zombie.

The special features on this DVD are good as well with the news broadcast and Andy's Terrifying Last Days. When watching the DVD it was good to watch these 2 features to warm up for the actual film. The news broadcast being that it shows you how the zombie outbrake increases more and more with scenes of bite victims being interviewed, people being got by zombies, and panicked news reporters. A brilliant feature with a lot of sparkle to it! Then Andy's Terrifying Last Days being a video made by Andy, the gunshop owner stranded alone in his gun store across the zombie infested parking lot. We don't get to see much of Andy's point of view during the actual film, so it's good to see what kind of a character he is, what he's thinking and how he fights to stay alive.

I would definitely give this film 5 stars as it's entertaining and exciting from start to finish and I'd certainly reccomend it to fans of the zombie genre. An exciting all action packed zombie film!",1286496000,,2604,4.503171247357294

2065887,3,B00027SIUK,"George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a classic horror movie that really didn't need to be retold...but that's exactly what director Zack Snyder has done so I guess I should review it after having seen it twice.  I admit there have been far worse remakes, but I can't help but sense how unnecessary this was especially since these two films are worlds apart in many ways.  They don't really remake Dawn of the Dead so much as they re-use some elements from the original script and slap the title ""Dawn of the Dead"" on it to get attention.

In the original film George A. Romero had used the setting of a mall to make satire of human nature.  In the Snyder film everything has been refit for zombie action.  George A. Romero used the stumbling zombies from his 'Night of the Living Dead'. Zach Snyder uses the Olympic Sprinter Zombies from '28 Days Later'.  Romero knew how to spread his movie out with a casual pace.  Snyder in the vain of all modern action movies uses quick cuts and generally seems to have everything moving as fast as it can giving no time for character development other that easily recognizable stereotypes.

I think its clear that I prefer the original...

But I don't think this is remake is bad.  Its just another zombie movie is all.  Nothing really special, nothing really bad about it.  It doesn't stand up to films like those of George A. Romero or 28 Days Later, but it is better than things like Resident Evil.

So, this new Dawn of the Dead is quite a bit of gore-filled fun, but as a whole is flat and uninteresting compared to the 1978 original.",1282348800,,1580,4.444444444444445

By the end of it, I was hitting the record on the DVR so the wife could see it cause I knew she would love it as well.

2065894,3,B00027SIUK,"I'm not going to talk about the movie, there's 700+ other reviews for that. Basically, is this worth buying on Blue Ray if you already have it on DVD? Probably not. The sound is crystal clear, as seems to be the case even on movies with the worst transfers. However, the picture isn't that great. It's slightly better than standard definition, but the blacks are grainy, and the sharpness comes and goes. It IS slightly better than SD, but fairly underwhelming otherwise. I think only big fans of this movie who will watch it often will benefit from HD.

I wouldn't re-buy it for your collection if you have to dust off your SD version when you watch it. So if you're thinking hey it's only $10 should I get it? Only if you don't already own it on SD or you're a big fan of the movie. No doubt, it's a great movie, probably the best remake in the series and probably best overall in the series including all the new ones and all the originals. But the upgrade to BR probably won't be worth it for most viewers.",1267401600,46,1010,4.315789473684211
2065895,5,B00027SIUK,"We really liked this new version of Dawn of the Dead because so many of the characters made smart choices just like you'd think you'd do in this situation.  Yes, people open doors they know they shouldn't.  Yes, there are still moron bad guys and at one point the look-at-me pouty face girl gets incredibly stupid and drives off into a crowd of zombies to save her dog.  Her dog!!!  But the main characters do smart things and make plans and try their best, although for some reason nobody ever seems to think of putting on leather jackets and hockey helmets and gloves since if you get bitten you're going to die.  Right?!?  I mean, you would put on as many clothes as you could!  But the action was absolutely horrific and knock-your-eyes-out fast.  Loved the music!  Loved the hyperactive zombies!

2065896,3,B00027SIUK,"A small group of survivors holes up in a shopping mall in order to survive a plague of zombies, who can only be stopped by destroying their brain.

Other than the absence of social commentary, the most obvious difference between this film and George Romero's original is the fact that these zombies are fast runners.  This ratchets up the scare factor in the early part of the film by making this version of the undead that much more dangerous and inescapable.  However, it soon becomes clear that the characters in this film, many of whom are inexperienced with guns, will be able to make as many head shots as necessary to ensure that the scenes play out as the script demands.  There are a number of particularly implausible escapes that feel very Hollywood and break the verisimilitude of the story in a way that the original never did.

Still, there is plenty of gore and several good scares, even if it does become a bit tiresome by the end.",1266364800,,947,4.579881656804734
2065897,4,B00027SIUK,"I can agree with other reviewers that, George Romero's original 1978 Dawn of the Dead being: a) a well-crafted horror film classic, b) in color, and c) featuring great special effects by Tom Savini, there was really no need at all to re-make it.

If you're going to re-make a film for any reason, it should be because the original: a) was a silent film (like Fritz Lang's 1926 Metropolis), b) had an intriguing premise, but was mediocre in execution (see many B-thrillers from the 1930s-50s), c) is from classic source material (like the novel Dracula or Shakespeare's Macbeth) , or d) was great, but you've got a new & exciting angle on old material (like the 1978 re-make of the 1956 Invasion of the Body Snatchers).  Otherwise, forget it.

What has the 2004 Dawn of the Dead got going for it?  Some good actors, esp. Ving Rhames.  A fantastic opening sequence (from the hospital to Sarah Polley crashing her car into a tree).  Good editing and exciting action scenes.  An ending that doesn't cop out --- esp. in that closing credits sequence.

What's not so good?  The two things that are so great about Romero's film -- the mall setting and the zombie ""shoppers"" -- are sadly underused here.  This version might just as well be taking place in a huge office complex, a college campus, or a large library or somewhere else.  The creative use that Romero made of the shopping mall seems to be mostly absent here -- the filmmakers commentary claims how irrelevant Romero's consumerist satire would be today.  Well, if that's the case, why bother setting this version in a shopping mall?  Maybe a big amusement park would've been more interesting -- wait, I think the recent Zombieland film does that.

Also, the director felt that seeing the zombies for more than a few seconds rendered them less scary.  Huh???  Does this guy think he's Val Lewton or something? -- see the 1943 Cat People for reference.

Final verdict: not bad as far as contemporary action-horror films go.  That's what Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is: an action-horror film, emphasis on the action.  George Romero's Dawn of the Dead might be called a horror-action film, emphasis on the horror.  Depends on what you're hungry for...",1266192000,,2205,4.73753280839895

Having said that, here's what I really like about this wonderful remake:

- The updated setting, story and feel
- Updated special effects - superb!
- Faster flow that makes this a bit easier to watch than the original
- The new level of terror introduced by zombies that run full speed!
- Using the ""Mall"" motif again
- Celebrity target practice - fun!
- The baby - yikes!

2065904,5,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead (2004): 10 out of 10: I sympathize with the fan boys that feel any remake of Dawn of the Dead is sacrilegious. You get an emotional attachment to films that scared you in your youth. (One on mine is Assault on Precinct 13 that was remade recently and I just know I will be disappointed with the remake. I am still scared of ice cream trucks as a result of seeing that film when I was 9)

Remakes themselves have a well deserved bad reputation. (Easiest movie trivia question: What is the best film remake? The Maltese Falcon of course. That Humphrey Bogart perennial was a remake of a 1931 film of the same name. I'm sure back in 1941 that there were a couple of people complaining that Bogart was no Ricardo Cortez and the ruined the story by taking out the affair and homosexual subplots. The first film after all was a pre-code affair.)

Dawn of the Dead is in reality a different movie than the original. This is no shot for shot Psycho remake nor is it the same movie with a glossier CGI coat of paint. It is a faster more intense zombie film. It is one of the best action horror films of the last ten years. The opening twenty minutes in simply one of the scariest action packed sequences I have ever seen. By the time our band of protagonists gets to the mall they are not the only one's catching their breath.

It becomes a pretty good sized group at the mall and you end up slogging through some slow bits as the zombies eat it down to a more manageable size. The acting is across the board good and the effects are suitably gory and plentiful. Director Zack Snyder wisely dumps much of Romero's sociological subplots and replaces them with a more timely commentary. (Instead of zombies as consumer motif we have shooting undead celebrities. And instead of an outwardly hostile motorcycle gang, we have a more subtle power struggle between the otherwise powerless.)

The updates honestly work, as a more literal remake would have simply fallen flat. Is Dawn of the Dead better than the original? I won't say. Is it one of the best films of 2004? Yes. Is it better than Romero's own sequel Day of the Dead? Good Lord yes.",1256601600,,2146,4.411616161616162

They've been making Zombie flicks since the 60's, most of them stink, there like porn you can only go in one direction with it.  This was not one of them, this was a good movie and it proved it at the box office.

2065906,5,B00027SIUK,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is the 2004 remake of the original 1978 classic horror film.

THE STORY: When dead people start coming back to life it seems like the end of the world. A group of people (led by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jack Weber and Michael Kelly) hold up in a shopping mall to survive while the dead increasingly congregate outside. What's going on? What can they do? How can they survive? And is there any hope?

Although the basic plot is the same as george Romero's orginal film the characters and storyline are completely different; hence, this is more of a re-envisioning rather than a true remake. Personally I prefer it this way. We already have the original so let's see a different take. No?

I just saw this film last night and it was so freakin' horrifying and INTENSE I couldn't sleep for two hours. This, for me, reveals the true effectiveness of a horror flick -- whether or not you can sleep afterwards. In this sense ""Dawn"" is a 5/5 Star film all the way.

What I liked about the story is that it takes the material seriously; there's no, goofy, campy, unrealistic vibe. What would it be like if dead people REALLY started coming back to life and seeking out living flesh to eat? This is the approach the filmmakers take here.

One reviewer complained that it was unrealistic that the characters on occasion would laugh, smile and joke around during such a dire, hopeless situation. But this isn't unbelievable at all. It's a natural defensive mechanism of the human psyche to try to have fun, joke and make the most out of a bad situation. I've seen it numerous times in my life and the lives of others over the years (car accident, hospitalization, destruction of property, serious illness, death, etc.). Besides, the film more than adequately portrays the downside of human reaction -- depression, violence, grief, madness, etc.

The only negative I can cite is the speeding-up effect used in the Third Act. It worked at times but too often it came across as awkward or amateurish and just served to confuse the viewing experience.

Some people didn't like the zombie birth scene but I found it well-done and effective.

The original was filmed at the Monroeville Mall near Pittsburgh, PA, while this remake was shot at the (now demolished) Thornhill Square Mall in Ontario, although the story takes place in Milwaukee.

The threatrical version runs 101 minutes (the version I saw) and the Director's Cut 110 minutes.

BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a truly intense, horrifying flick you can't go wrong with this 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead.""",1254528000,,2582,4.70509977827051

2065908,1,B00027SIUK,"I'm big on George Romero and I was heavily biased to this film prior to seeing the previews on TV. When I saw how scary the first ten minutes were (notice I only said ten minutes) I was hooked and ready to see it.

What ensued was a massive disappointment. Again notice I only said the first ten minutes were actually scary. They were, until the break in the credits and a jump back to reality. The story sounds completely false and forced after the ten minute rush, then continues to fall apart faster than the zombies do.

The only actors that seemed to be actually trying and didn't look bored was Ving Rhames. He was the only likable character aside from the Boyd Banks character which later became the butcher in ""Land of the Dead"". Sarah Polley's dialog sounds stilted and she looks completely lost through the last half of the film. Mekhi Phifer is a great actor who could have had a better part than the gangster-like character he protrayed here.

Also the zombies here lack believability, half of them are to torn to (expletive deleted) and still are able to run like they were intact. Also the deleted scene in which the zombies are walking and suddenly explode into NASCAR racers in zero seconds is a bit trite and illogical. Just as well, the sad attempt at quelling the bias towards the film by adding homages and casting characters from the original was a sad gamble at best. I love Scott Reiniger, Tom Savini and Ken Foree, though their parts lose meaning here and obviously it's a ploy to get advocates of the original to come see the new one.

Especially the tagline of the film itself, ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth,"" loses much of its reverence as it's spoken out of context to lampoon religion here. The whole point was to point out the origins of zombies, not to make a statement against religious and political views. Poor Tom barely gets any airtime and Scott is lost in the broadcasts somewhere.

Even with the additional footage, which is only of them breaking into the mall and seeing the walking zombie become a cheetah, isn't really worth the extra money. There wasn't really anything to add to the story or fill the gaps, even the poorly assembled Andy's last video looked like it was ""Blair-Witched"" together at the last minute.

2065923,5,B00027SIUK,"Yes, the original is still better, but director Zack Snyder does a pretty good job making the remake almost as good as the one that started it all.
 The movie starts off with Ana (Sarah Polley) leaving a day at the hospital; she's a nurse. She goes home to her loving husband, and even talks to her neighbor, Vivian, who is just learning how to skate. She goes to bed. The next morning, something goes into her house. It's Vivian. And she's pretty hungry. From that point Ana is thrown into a world were the dead walk the earth, very hungry. After she watches her husband die and come back, she escapes out of her bathroom window, and runs out of her house to see her normal suburban neighborhood thrown into chaos. She drives away, as helicopters fly overhead, cars crash into each other, people beg for help, and the dead, whom can now run, stalk the living.

 The movie is relentless, and goes for shocks rather than Romero's version. As the survivors head for an abandoned mall, nobody is safe. From the time the beginning news clips start rolling, you know this ones going for scares. The only two funny parts are towards the end, where Chips (watch the movie to understand) is lowered down, and where they're dragging the bitten man in the sewers and he's shooting at the zombies in a ridiculous position.

 The one problem with this movie is that the middle starts to fall apart, simply from lack of characterization; there are too many characters! Towards the second half off the movie though they start to get picked off, and the movie rolls on to its conclusion.

 I know I'm not giving much of a summary here, but I don't simply because the movie is too good to give away. After the excellent beginning, the movie is splashed with shocks chock full of scares.

 The extras are excellent too, with news reels that explain more, and a ""documentary"" that the guy in the gun store filmed.

2065927,4,B00027SIUK,"George A. Romero discovered a universal truth: Zombies rock. What's not to love? Shambling, animated corpses with a taste for living flesh? Desperate survivors with trigger happy fingers decapitating said zombies with rusty machetes or well-aimed head shots? Zombies piling up like chords of wood? And the screaming!

It's like Christmas at the organ donor shop.

Romero's original ""Dawn of the Dead"" made in 1978 is a lot of things: horrifying, taboo-shattering, gory, and disturbing. It's also horror camp at its finest - skewering the mass consumer culture of the United States in our most shallow of decades: the 1970s.

Romero has a gleefully good time with his pack of survivors holed up in an indoor shopping mall. The slow-moving zombies that bang into the display cases or stumble up the escalators aren't so far removed from normal everyday mall shoppers - at least according to Romero.

Why do the zombies congregate at the mall? ""Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives,"" one of the characters informs us.

Yeah, even dead we like buying stuff at the mall.

But one thing the Romero film is not? Scary.

That's one reason why we're also fans of the much maligned 2004 remake by director Zack Snyder. That's a sacrilege in many quarters, but for pure fright - Snyder tops Romero. That's the truth. Romero's low-budget wonder is a classic - no doubt. It can be uncomfortable to watch, but there is more dark humor than actual chills. Romero focused his film on his wicked wit: satire instead of terror.

Snyder isn't interested in delivering a sardonic message. He wants to scare you. And damn it if he doesn't. His zombies - like the times we live in - are fast. There's no shambling here - but straight out sprinting.

The gem of Snyder's movie is the opening 10 minutes. It may be the most frightening sequence of any horror movie made over the last 20 years. It has a disjointed, sour flavor as if the orange juice you drink every morning has been spiked with cyanide.

Sarah Polley plays a nurse named Ana. She's at the end of a difficult shift at the hospital. All she wants to do is go home. Traveling home over washed out streets in a bland suburban tract, she arrives home for ""date night"" with her husband. They make love in their messy, little bed in their messy, little house.

Then it all goes to hell.

The little girl next door wonders in and lo and behold the lower half of her face has been chewed off. She creeps into the bedroom and Ana's husband jumps up concerned. But before he can react, she takes a bite of flesh out of his neck.

Ana locks the little girl out of the bedroom and then has a grueling life and death struggle as her husband dies and then reanimates as a zombie. It's bone rattling violence and by the time Ana gets into her car - her neighborhood, her world is in chaos.

It's absolutely chilling.

While the overall Snyder's film doesn't quite live up to the original (and the characters make some ridiculous decisions - especially at the end), Snyder delivers a zombie movie that belongs on the list of greatest undead flicks ever made - with Romero's original and the superb ""28 Days Later.""

The two movies follow the same premise - but are very different movies. That's why you can enjoy them both: turn to Romero for the horrifying satire (you can often overlook the rather awkward acting) and then lean on Snyder for some in-your-face terror (and for using Johnny Cash's ""Man Comes Around"" as an opening number).

Either way -- it's a great two for one.

2065930,2,B00027SIUK,"Ok, so the 2004 Zack Snyder remake of George Romero's Dawn Of The Dead is better than his own fourth Dead movie, Land Of The Dead, but it's still not nearly as good as the original 1978 Dawn Of The Dead. The basic problem is that the film violates its own universe's rules so many times that the film falls apart narratively. One can get away with things that are illogical in real life, but not according to the film's own precepts. In contrast to the Romero canon, zombies in this film can run like Olympic sprinters. Why? No reason except the financial success of the British zombie film 28 Days. Also, in the Romero canon, anyone who dies becomes a zombie, whereas in this film you are zombified only by a bite. Yet, if so, how did the first zombie, Zombie Zero, come to be?
  That said, this film is not bad, merely a solid action/horror flick that follows the same general pattern as the original Dawn Of The Dead, except that instead of four survivors in a mall there are a dozen or so. Illogic rules, as in all horror and sci fi films, and the plot is propelled by the characters doing the dumbest things possible, such as the climactic scene where they make a dash from the mall to a marina to head for an island they think will be safe haven.... For fans of the Romero canons there are a few cool cameos by Tom Savini (Romero's original makeup man), and Scott Reiniger and Ken Foree, from the original Dawn Of The Dead, with Reiniger as a military man interviewed on television, and Foree as a televangelist repeating his famed declamation from the original, `When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' This, and a bevy of other little `moments', is enough for me to recommend the film as a solid reinterpretation of the superior original, despite its reliance on the `humans are their own worst enemies' mantra, although the DVD features make this a much stronger recommendation for those zombiephiles out there.",1221004800,,1946,4.509915014164306

Welcome to this brave new world, teaming with the hungering legions of the damned and demented. An inexplicable virus has taken over the barren husks of those who have died and has risen them as new beings - - - beings who must sate themselves on the gory, writhing remains of the living. And, in the soulless eyes of these macabre creatures, a new world takes form - - - a world filled with the wails of the tormented dying, a world drenched in the blood of innocents, a world where corruption and decay rule all, a world where hope has died and been buried. In this Stygian realm, the few survivors must make a new way of life, must lock themselves in a fortress of solitude for their physical safety. They must, regardless of the consequences, band together against the gruesome hordes that await their warm flesh. However, will the slow onset of mental imbalances, unrequited loneliness, and barren heartedness eat them alive before their loved ones do? Only time will tell. The clock is ticking. The dead are waiting. Step up to the gallows. . .

A Film to Die for:

While the horror genre has long been home to the musings of the demented, Dawn of the Dead takes depression and loneliness to a whole new level creating a film that, simply put, is to die for. The aura is suitably, almost entrancingly, morbid as the film delves into not only the gory rampages of the newly turned, but on the all too real emotions experienced by the few survivors as they struggle to remain alive and, even harder, sane. While Dawn of the Dead is by no means a deep film, it does have that certain something, that inexplicable magic, that makes the viewer care. Yes, indeed, this is one those films that you will spend yelling at the screen, warning the unwitting characters to turn around, or not go down that creepy corridor, or even better, not to hover near those that have just died, indulging in long moments of anguish without remembering just what happens to the corpses of the infected victims. Yes, the characters lack that certain brain power, but, unlike most zombie flicks, it's believable. They reside in a world that rotates around death, not life. A world that overnight turned into a carnal house stacked with the bodies of those they once loved so it is acceptable, even believable, that the characters would have trouble grasping the ramifications of some of their actions, including their ""daring"" plan in the conclusion.

Of course, the best story in the world is only as good as its telling. How many times have we, the exalted viewers of America, been presented with an interesting movie concept that despite the ingenuity has failed on every level (Aeon Flux comes to mind). And, conversely, how many times have we been presented with a simple, unadorned story that for some reason spellbinds the entire audience (think of Paper Moon.) Dawn of the Dead most certainly falls into the later category. Like most George Romero films (with the exception of that travesty Land of the Dead) the acting is brilliant and emotional, the special effects are surprisingly (and sometimes upsettingly) realistic, and the entire aura of the movie from beginning to end is dismal yet somehow, strangely appealing. Dawn of the Dead creates a horrible world, yet the viewer will want to visit it again and again.

As the movie gains force, the conclusion rushes forward and although, as briefly mentioned above, the characters' daring scheme does present the viewer with major qualms, it is believable and even suitable. Unlike those ""cliff hanger"" movies that misconstrue intrigue with irritation and decide to end with no revelation or meaning Dawn of the Dead ends dramatically, poignantly, and memorably satisfying the viewer and rounding out the entire movie nicely, leaving no room for complaints or questions. Also, one word of advice, be sure and watch the ending credits because an important event is actually portrayed as the credits role. This is part of the conclusion and is highly important.

Extra Information and a Note to Potential Viewers:

The version of Dawn of the Dead that I viewed was the unrated director's cut (which I highly recommend). The film was originally rated R in theaters. Since this movie contains extreme gore, violence, bad language, and brief scenes of nudity, viewer discretion is advised (and yes, I got that from TV). For those who are interested in the actors/actresses these are some of the names of the outstanding cast: Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer. Also, Dawn of the Dead boasts an excellent soundtrack especially the concluding song, so don't miss it!

2065933,4,B00027SIUK,"If you're into zombie movies this is definitely not one to miss. Plenty of action and gore. While not as epic as the original, definitely a well made ""re-invisioning"" of Dawn Of The Dead.",1216252800,,187,4.529411764705882
2065934,3,B00027SIUK,"I was rather excited when I first heard about a ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, partly because I was pleasantly surprised by Tom Savini's 1990 updating of ""Night of the Living Dead"" (also reviewed), which against the odds actually turned out to be pretty good.

I've loved the 1978 G. Romero version of ""Dawn of the Dead"", sequel to ""Night of the Living Dead"", but it was getting somewhat long in the tooth and starting looking horribly dated...a major problem with many classic 70's movies. So, the updating of a genre classic seemed to be a good idea and timely. The plot seemed to be the same, the characters were being played by non-stars and the early stills looked promising.

Then the bad news started to seep in. Romero didn't give his blessing, `nobody' director Zack Snyder was at the helm and he had also decided that his living dead were going to be able to run the hundred yard dash without a hint of difficulty. None of which bode well. In fact, the remake was looking more and more like a cynical attempt to cash in on a famous eye-catching title and a cheap re-visioning of Romero's script instead of actually creating a new one.

The James Gunn script (Michael Tolkin and Scott Frank were brought in for rewriting) of the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" follows Romero's quite closely; a group of human survivors of an unexplained apocalypse seek refuge in a huge mall complex as the recently dead start returning to life with an horrific desire to feed on living flesh. It may sound a bit thin, but in Romero's hands it was the middle section of a running series and he used it as a stinging critique on American society and its indulgent consumerist excess.

Snyder's film dispenses with Romero's sly swipe at consumerism though. The super new 'American' malls of 1978 had become so commonplace, not just in the States but also in most parts of the Western World that such a comment from that angle would have been redundant. In fact the Thornhill Square Shopping Centre in Ontario was considered old fashioned. It was torn down after shooting wrapped. Of course consumerism is still a large part of modern human life (probably more so than in 1978), but a mall these days is nothing new. In fact the mall motif is used in Snyder's film because he probably couldn't think of anything different other than the set-up provided by Romero.

Where both versions succeed however, is in grimness which is an essential element in any zombie apocalypse movie. Romero's version has liberal doses of humour (some of it silly like the ineptly handled pie-fight sequence) to relieve the tension and the slowness of the piece. But Snyder wisely abandons putting in slapstick, in favour of more considered humour as in the scene where the survivors and the isolated Andy (Bruce Bohne) in the gun store across the street, relieve their boredom by shooting zombies that look like famous celebrities: ""...Rosie O'Donnell! tell him to shoot Rosie!"" It's funny, but grim, because the celeb zombies are searched for among thousands of other hungry walking corpses waiting outside in the streets below. It's a vision of the breakdown of social norms and structure. The original version presents this breakdown too, but in a more subtle way. Humanity slowly turns off the lights of offices in the city and melts into darkness as the survivors steal a TV station helicopter and learn to begin surviving on their own in the grim new reality. In many ways Romero's more studied and slower film presents a more realistic breakdown of social order than Snyder's fast paced vision.

But Snyders worst 'sin' in his magpie remake is his misguided tinkering with Romero's take on the living dead. Whereas Romero's favourite monsters are a slow, rotting, shuffling horde whose sheer number and relentless advance is very much part of their creepy menace, Snyders zombies are like Linford Christie or Ben Johnson. They have no problem racing at 25MPH toward their victims. There are some who find this particular addition to ""zombie attributes"" exciting, but I found it to be a completely ridiculous. Snyder's living dead possess the muscular strength needed to run at sustained speeds but they cannot break the windows of a shopping centre to get to the human flesh inside. I can suspend belief enough for the idea of the dead coming back to life and wanting to eat flesh, but I draw the line at them running all over the place without any difficulty at all. They are, after all, re-animated corpses and should be subject to some sort of difficulty in movement. The worst offender of these new super strength zombies is the legless corpse who attacks the heroes in the underground carpark. It's a haphazard attempt at a cheap shock and it doesn't work.

On the plus side, Snyder's film has better make-up effects and more accomplished gore. Of course, Tom Savini was at the cutting edge of horror makeup in 1978 and there have been many advances made in makeup effects (a lot instituted by Savini himself) and many have been incorporated into David Anderson's special effects crew for the movie, I'm sure. However, as Snyder admits himself, Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is gorier.

Also in the movies favor is generally good acting from all concerned. Sarah Polley (as Ana) deserves special mention as she is in nearly every scene and carries her character well and Jake Weber (as Michael) also does a good turn as the quiet unassuming member of the group. Ving Rhames (as Kenneth Hall) plays himself again and most of the others are there really just to make up numbers, but do a good job.

Other highlights of Snyder's version is an exciting helicopter shot opening and great end credits using a ""Blair Witch"" style handheld camera sequence, although the inclusion of Disturbed's - 'Down With The Sickness' is annoying and further sends the 2004 film down the MTV route. In fact the end credits present scenes that are far more terrifying than anything that actually makes it into the film's main running time.

Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not a bad film overall and it's certainly a worthy entry into the 'Living dead' cannon, but it suffers from a number of mis-steps and ideas that could have / should have been dropped in the first place, like the ridiculous zombie childbirth and the running corpses themselves...and where Romero's long script and running time leaves the viewer satisfied at its end, Snyder's film seems rushed at its end. It feels clipped as if the film had been mercilessly cut down from a much monger project. As a result I was left wanting and unsatisfied at the conclusion.",1214179200,,6581,4.769973661106233

Like the original, the film depicts a handful of human survivors who find shelter in a shopping mall only to be surrounded by swarms of zombies. It's quite different than the original. The film is directed by Zack Snyder(best known for the movie, 300). It stars Ving Rhames, Jack Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Sarah Polley and Kim Poirier. Unlike the Night of the Living Dead remake, Dawn of the Dead was made on a $28,000,000 budget and it shows. The movie itself grossed over $102,356,381 to date and is still doing well in DVD sales. It's a favorite among zombie fans. This edition includes footage that was intended to be in the movie originally but was cut for theatrical release. The DVD offers several other scenes which were not included in any version of the film as well as more. Very entertaining reimagining, if you ask me.

2065939,4,B00027SIUK,"Blasphemy? It's just the new style in horror filmaking, so we better get use to it! Romero deserves hughe credit, but even he knows, as it shows in his two latest releases, you have to update your style or get devoured. Every stage in history of the horror cinema was new and improving at the time, regardless of the country or culture, style or sub-genre, and this is not the exception: behold the zombie culture for the 00's .

Standing aside for the obvious and tedious comparisons between the monumental 1978 classic zombie epic and this new energizing version, the first feature film and interesting  work of director Zack Snider ( who also did ""300""), i would like to take this movie as a fair example and unique precedent for today's new standards in the style of horror filmaking.  Romero's work and Zack Snider's vision are almost diametrically different, only sharing the very essence or intentions of the zombie apocalypse. Therefore, you need to see this movie to comprehend what's new, in order to catch the very improvements in the style, aesthetics and simple angles of the source.

In this original revision of the catastrophic plague of the undead, the camera and directing style can only be described as KINETIC TENSION: the action is restless, the desperation for survive exceeds the known speed limits, the zombie's cappacities are exponential in number and power, any blink of an eye may result in a painful and gruesome death. The running murderous corpses are raging, rabid predators very similar to Danny Boyle's virus-eaten victims in ""28 days later"". With these kind of monsters on the loose, the only chance to survive is running like hell and seek refuge in a mall, along with a large variety of characters representing different social angles, personalities and points of view about the unexplicable horror they witness, but the unaccountable damage to their lives doesn't seem to bother them much. That's a down point: The almost total lack of awareness and personal or collective emotional suffering facing such dramatic and horrifying events. Au contraire, they seem prepared  for the devastation of society by being calmed, creative and enlisting to make the best of it. So much for deepness in the story and moral struggle for the characters.

Zack Snider's work  is much more involved with action sequences and extreme tension, but leaving behind the creepy and gruesome atmosphere of what the end of the world implies is risky, specially under the attack of  pissed-off zombie hordes. So, by leaving both deepness in psychological terror and the grisly atmosphere, the remaing movie is a fair action-gorefest race out of hell. What's wrong with that? And forget about social satire and anti-consumerism, old story: the mall is just a circumstancial fortress instead of a delirious palace of joy.

I'm not leaving my horror back-up behind, no way, is just that classic fans of the zombie mythology understand the diversity of  styles, but somehow we can't digest it. The movie's not obviously a masterpiece like the ones in our classic collection, but if we don't give these flicks a chance we will get stuck in our memories, blinded by prejudice.

So don't resist it, enjoy it! A colorful action packed gore film is not worse than a dark atmospheric creepy film, this is the living proof! Dawn of the dead, down with the sickness: Check the Zack Snider's vision of the zombie apocalypse and his incredible rapid-fire kinetic style, this movie represents the new breed of the passionate demented genre we all love! His ideas are fresh and his editing aesthetics and music rules!",1207094400,,3613,4.96523178807947
2065940,5,B00027SIUK,"I'm opposed to all these remakes on principle so a five star rating from me is a grudging one. I can't deny the fact that I'm not certain I've seen better pacing in a horror flick though. When DotD kicks off, you feel like you're in fun but pretty familiar territory as the main protagonist ignores all signs of impending doom on a drive home from work.

Then, just when the first spark of thought leading to the inevitable phase of any horror flick where you ask yourself how long it's going to take to go through the usual motions (introducing all the characters, giving us reasons to supposedly care about them, making sure an audience of idiots has a 2 and a 2 to make 4 with, etc...), you will feel as if you've been dropped via a trap door into a swirling mass of zombie disaster that will blow your mind.

The film gives you a few minutes to catch your breath and have a few laughs in the middle and then the horror factor kicks in with renewed vigor for a stunning finish.

They run. It might sound stupid or like a no-brainer update to the genre but somehow this film never lets you forget that a sprinting tireless zombie horde is a really nasty problem to have in ways that 28 Days Later and Romero's Land of the Dead fail to.",1206489600,,1237,4.25531914893617

2065942,5,B00027SIUK,"This is the best zombie movie of today. Zack Snyder has really opened his career in Hollywood at a good impression.

CAUTION: SPOILER ALERT!

Ana, a nurse, finishes a long shift at her Milwaukee County hospital and returns to her peaceful suburban home. She and her waiting husband Louis make love and go to sleep, missing warnings beginning to trickle through the local media concerning a mysterious and rapidly-spreading contagion which turns its infected hosts into reanimated flesh-eating ghouls.

The next morning they are awoken by their zombified neighbor, a young girl, who bites Louis in the throat. Ana locks the zombie out of the room, but despite her frantic efforts, Louis dies, immediately reanimates as a zombie, and chases Ana into the bathroom. Ana escapes out the window and flees from her now chaos-torn neighborhood in her car, before a failed hijacking attempt sends her crashing into a tree. The opening credits roll, showing the worldwide collapse of human civilization.

Ana meets Kenneth, a grim police sergeant traveling to Fort Pastor, a nearby US Army base. With the route to the base blocked by zombies, they and three others - jack-of-all-trades Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant Russian wife Luda - break into the nearby Crossroads Shopping Mall. inside the mall a scuffle with a zombified mall security guard results in Luda getting a minor bite-wound and Kenneth getting a cut on his arm.

They confront three living security guards - C.J., Bart and Terry - and give up their weapons in exchange for refuge. After the group secures the mall, they head up to the mall's roof to dispose of bodies and paint SOS signs. There, they ""meet"" another survivor, Andy, who is stranded alone in his gun store, across the mall's zombie-infested parking lot.

The next day, a delivery truck arrives at the mall, carrying the driver Norma, jerkish Steve, working man Tucker, elderly Glen, trampy Monica, bitten Frank and his teen daughter Nicole, and an anonymous (and severely-injured) obese woman. These newcomers report that Fort Pastor has been overrun by zombies and no help is coming. Shortly after, the obese woman dies, reanimates and is killed by Ana, who thrusts a metal fireplace poker into her eye. The group determines that bites are how the zombies multiply their numbers; after Ana and Michael argue about what to do with the rapidly-deteriorating Frank, the man is isolated in a store with guard Kenneth, allowing him ""every single second"" before expiring. Michael and Ana achieve an awkward reconciliation, which is interrupted by Kenneth's shotgun blast as he destroys Frank's reanimated body.

Though the mall provides many material distractions and the survivors begin pairing off romantically (Ana and Michael, Terry and Nicole, Steve and Monica), the undead surround the refuge in ever-increasing numbers. Finally the malls power goes out and Michael, C.J., Bart and Kenneth enter the underground parking garage to turn on the emergency generator. After they meet an unaffected dog, a zombie swarm kills Bart and traps the others in the generator compartment, where they douse the zombies with gasoline and set them ablaze.

Andre, faced with the fact that Luda will soon die, sinks totally into denial, and has his heavily-pregnant and infected wife tied to a bed in the mall's children's store. As she gives birth, she dies and reanimates. Norma checks on the couple, discovering the zombie-Luda and the demented Andre clutching a small bundle of blankets. Norma shoots Luda, causing Andre to snap completely; they exchange more gunfire, mortally wounding each other. Ana arrives on scene and opens the bundle to reveal a zombie baby. She pulls her revolver and a single shot rings through the mall.

At an impromptu memorial, Kenneth says anything is better than ""sitting around waiting to die"". The remaining mall-dwellers thus plot to fight their way to the local marina, and from there travel out on Steve's small yacht to an island in Lake Michigan. They reinforce two small shuttle buses from the parking garage, removing the seats, welding on a snowplow, attaching metal bars and floodlights, stringing barbed wire, boarding up the windows, and cutting slits for the deployment of weapons. Chainsaws, propane tanks and other supplies are also loaded on board. Meanwhile, Andy is starving, and will not have the strength to join the escape (and contribute much-needed ammunition), so the mall survivors strap a pack of food on ""Chips"", the dog from the basement, and lower him into the parking lot in a sling. Unfortunately, while Chips makes it safely to the gun-shop, a zombie gets in as well and badly injures Andy. Nicole, distraught over Chips, takes the delivery truck and barges her way into the gun store, where a now-zombified Andy traps her in a closet.

Kenneth, Michael, C.J., Terry, and Tucker gather their meager weapon supply and go into the sewers, while Steve is assigned guard-duty on their exit door. They reach the gun store, where they kill Andy, rescue Nicole and stock up on weapons and ammunition. A detonated propane tank is used to clear a path back to the sewers, but the zombies pursue them, Tucker is killed and (thanks to Steve's negligence) the zombies force open the exit door. The survivors pile into the buses and smash out into the parking lot, where another propane bomb is used to clear a path through the waiting horde. When Glen moves to take out a last hitchhiking zombie with a chainsaw, a sudden swerve sends the weapon slashing into Monica's shoulder. The resulting splatter of blood covers the windshield, causing driver Kenneth to lose control and crash. Glen and Monica are killed, while Steve flees the toppled bus and is attacked by the hitchhiking zombie.

The others scramble for the second bus, meeting zombie-Steve en route. Ana shoots him dead, then must linger long enough to get the boat keys off his corpse, allowing more zombies to catch up with them. Ana flees back to the bus, where Michael helps her in. After a short struggle, they pull away and speed to the marina dock, where they crash the bus and dash for the boat. Cornered in the bus by their pursuers, C.J. detonates a final propane tank blowing up the vehicle, the zombies, and himself. The remainder of the group gets on the boat, except for Michael; he was bitten while helping Ana. Ana futilely pleads with him to come, and the boat sets sail with Terry, Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, and Chips. Ana watches unflinchingly as Michael draws his pistol, places it under his chin, and a final gunshot rings out over the water.

The end-credits roll, interspersed with video footage taken by Terry, using a camera from the boat. Following a grim voyage where water, fuel and food supplies all run low, the remaining survivors succeed in reaching an island, only to be immediately attacked by a new swarm of zombies. As the survivors attempt to retreat to the boat, the camera falls to the ground and blacks out, leaving their ultimate fate unknown.

So its a great film",1205798400,,7040,4.950889077053344
2065943,5,B00027SIUK,"So many people decried the makers of this film when they learned that the classic of all modern day zombie films was going to be remade. Rather than wait and see what the final product was, they chose the low road of attacking it based on their cherished memories of the past, the midnight showings where a world was exposed to the inner workings of creator George Romero's zombie nightmare. They should have waited and judged the final product instead. Not to mention the fact that in allowing his name to be used, Romero is now going to see some financial gain. Buy a ticket and send him some money.

The plot is simple and follows that established in 1968 in the original. For some unknown reason, the dead are coming back to life with one thing on their mind, eating the living. There you have it in a nutshell. Now, let's take that story and add in the human elements and you have a tale.

This time around the story begins with Ana (Sarah Polley), a young nurse who wakes to find her world turned upside down. An attack by the little girl next door leads to her husband's death and subsequent attack. Ana escapes into a world she doesn't recognize where neighbors attack one another and no help is in sight. After wrecking her car, she meets with a policeman named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and they head out, coming into contact with three other survivors. Together, this rag tag group heads for the mall in the hopes of finding other survivors there as well.

Instead, they are attacked by another zombie. Looking for high ground, they head to the elevators only to be greeted by the mall's security guards who ask them to leave. Convincing them to allow them to stay for a while, the group eventually comes to realize that they have a better chance if they work together, even if it takes force for the Ana's group to convince the guards.

Going to the roof to search for help, the assembly discovers that none is in sight. Instead, the mall is surrounded by zombies all eager to kill and feed. When a helicopter flies overhead and continues on, they know that they are on their own.

The movie offers us a glimpse at how each of the survivors deals with their situation, including another group that drives in and is offered shelter. By this time they have come to realize that a bite from one of the dead results in a quick death and subsequent rise to feast on flesh. One of these later survivors has been bitten and is already showing signs. His daughter is distraught over the possibility of losing her father, but the inevitable happens.

Looking for solutions, the possibility of leaving the mall and heading out to the marina where they will take a boat to one of the neighboring islands is discussed. With the chance that the island won't have near as many zombies on it as the mainland, they set out to do just that. Creating a pair of battlewagons from the store's shuttle buses, they head out into a sea of zombies with hunger in mind.

Many people who view this will indeed make comparisons between it and the original film. The makers of this one have stated that they are not remaking the film, only offering their version of how it could have played out.

One review I read found two major faults this time around. The first was that the movie changed the zombie mythos created years ago where zombies were moving slowly, unable to more fast due to rigor setting in. The other was that there were no personalized zombies as in the first, such as the nurse zombie, the cheerleader zombie, etc. Both criticisms were lost to me as I was engulfed in the story more than the zombies. And the fact that these zombies, as in 29 DAYS LATER, moved with speed and quickness, made the movie more terrifying. As with the old mummy movies, I often wondered why people couldn't avoid a creature that moved with a handicapped gait. The fact that they could move in this movie made them more horrific.

This time around, the zombies seem scarier than ever before. The action is plentiful and makes the pacing of the movie revolve around not just the question of how survivors react, but how they will compete when facing off of these hungry creations that live only to eat.

The movie is scary, thought provoking and kept me glued to the seat waiting to see what would happen next. While Romero's earlier work was a fantastic film, this one ranks up there as well, offering that second take that the film makers said they wanted to provide. My only gripe? The ending. And no matter how much it disappointed me, I would never reveal it. Go and sit it that darkened theater, alone with a multitude of strangers, and find out for yourself. And wonder all along if any of them might be eyeing you as their next meal ticket.",1205366400,,4724,4.495337995337995

Lets be honest the 78 version was good in 78, not now. Blue zombies, orange blood lumbering around (if you get caught you deserve it) the pie fight scene and the lame dialogue of the 78 version just doesn't age well. And lets not forget the ""dead rise and eat the living"" is believable, but the ""recently infected can run"" is somehow unbelievable.

2065949,3,B00027SIUK,"It's kind of strange to be reviewing Dawn of the Dead, the 2004 remake of the film of the same name originally done by George Romero. I've never actually seen the original (or any of them for that matter...well except that god-awful Land of the Dead though) so while most people are watching this with a sense of ""how does it stack up to the original"" while I'm just simply wondering if it's a good film or not. While I prefer my horror films foreboding and creepy, there's at least enough to recommend here, even if it's not exceptionally well-done from beginning to end.

Nurse Ana is having a normal day at the hospital with some people mentioning cases of bites but nothing out of the ordinary. After coming home to her husband (or boyfriend?) and falling asleep, Ana wakes up to find her neighbor's kid with blood on her lips and takes a chunk out of Ana's neck. Ana escapes and eventually meets up with some survivors and they hide out in the mall. But these people willing to chomp on them are outside and eventually they'll either get in or they'll be a reason to try and get out.

A lot of the older horror films and the films coming out of Asia are mainly concerned with developing a sense of dread and unease; a creepy atmosphere that's meant to make you feel uncomfortable. However, films like Hostel, the Saw series and others are mainly concerned with using as much disgusting stuff happening to their characters, thinking that's what'll scare people. Well it doesn't scare me (in fact, it's mainly a disgust factor, not a scare factor) but it's a bit more tense and action-packed than I'd expect from a horror film and it all starts with the ""zombies"". Instead of the slow, constipated walk of the old days, these zombies bolt to get to their prey and the film benefits from it.

One of the more surprising things about the film is in its casting. Normally these films are littered with WB...sorry, CW veterans that end up getting munched/chopped up so it's weird to see indie favorite Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Pfifer, and Kim Poirier but they also manage to create likable characters. My one gripe is their defenses against the horde of undead after them. I mean, they're in a mall! Surely something must be available in these stores to wail on some zombies but they just make an armored van. Poo.

It's a likable zombie film sure although I'm not a big fan of them. Some hate it, some love it while some find it merely entertaining so I'm kind of the last one: it didn't zap under 2 hours of my life but I didn't feel like I gained anything having watched it.",1192406400,,2584,4.491489361702127

I am not one of those horror fans that are against updating old horror films; sometimes a horror movie needs a face lift in order for new generations of horror fans to rediscover the original classics. Unfortunately this new version of Dawn of the Dead doesn't follow even remotely the plot of the original, it just takes advantage of the name (still of the coolest names for any horror movie ever) in order to make more money then it otherwise would have made.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-the-Living-Dead/dp/B00000K3TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of the Living Dead</a>&nbsp;the remake was a wonderful homage to the original black and white classic and really could brag being a remake. This movie could have been called any other name, they didn't have to call it a remake because in fact it really isn't, but they did. Don't be fooled, this movie has almost nothing in common with the original so to refer to it as a remake is unfair and misleading.

Now, to the movie itself. Set in modern day Milwaukee Dawn of the Dead follows the life of Anna, a nurse at a local hospital, as a strange and unexplained virus brakes out and quickly throws the world into chaos. One night her life is relatively happy, she's talking about taking a three day weekend with her husband and complains about her rude bosses; then the next morning she watches in horror as her beloved husbands neck is bitten off by the neighbor's sweet little girl and sees him turn into a bloodthirsty killer. Escaping from her home, she looks on as the quiet little suburban neighborhood she lives in is transformed into a battlefield as hundreds of dazed and confused people wander though the streets watching their homes burn and their lives fall apart. Mixed amongst these unsuspecting bystanders are dozens of zombies carrying with them a plague of biblical proportions. Within a week social order collapses, in a month there is nothing but silence. Anna manages to survive by escaping with a former cop, a gangster and his wife, and a guy that works at Best Buy to the local fortress, the Crossroads shopping mall.

It is at that point this scary and intriguing film starts to fall apart. The director made a terrible mistake by deciding to take Anna out of the chaos so quickly. The five minutes between Anna waking and her escape to the mall are by far the most interesting parts of this movie. The chaos in the streets, the mad scramble by the military and police to make sense of the unbelievable situation, and the random zombies running though the streets almost unnoticed are very chilling and by far are the scariest parts of this film. No other zombie film with the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;showed the madness that would result from a crises of this nature. However, it only lasts five minutes. Once they enter the mall they are safe, the zombies can't get in and they can't go out, so any advantage gained by making the zombies sprinters instead of walkers is lost. What good is having a running zombie if the characters are unreachable? of course this is a recipe for disaster as the director realizes his mistake and resorts to petty scares like the classic lights going out gag, and everyone going into the dark and creepy basement, and then zombies popping out of nowhere and yelling ""boo."" These zombie scenes come off as forced and unnatural, making the viewer suspend their belief far too many times for it to be taken seriously; and this movie desperately wants to be taken seriously. This could have been so much better if they had just made it a spoof, but instead they tried to be serous and ended up with this mess.

Although this movie has plenty of memorable moments, it doesn't really add anything new to the zombie genre, unless of course you count the zombie baby which I don't because Peter Jackson already did it in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Alive/dp/157362408X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Alive</a>.

2065952,5,B00027SIUK,"I have been asked before ""why do you like zombie movies so much"" and the answer is this; the undead are the one of the few bad guys I know of in horror land that you cannot reason with. You cannot yell at them to ""stop"" or ""wait"" or ""Jason it's your mother"" Imagine being pursued by something so familiar as a human being , knowing that its no longer functioning on your level. It is now a stumbling, or running eating machine that you have to get away from quickly lest it scratches or bites you. The thought of turning into one of them, is incomprehensible. Other monsters such as vampires or werewolves that still have human form retain their intelligence to a point, they can still enjoy a cup of wine or watch Friends on TBS. Zombies, on the other hand, exist only to feed on your flesh , slowly rotting away till there is nothing left but a jiggling mass of putrid goo. We love our lifestyles and we all know that zombies equal the downfall of society, and that's horrific to us!

 Filmmakers either get the undead or they don't. George Romero gets it, that's indisputable. He gets them because he gets human nature. Zach Snyder also gets them he just has a different take. Romero's visions have always been based in the sociological mythos, Snyder touches on that but really takes the movie to a more basic level, which is to shock and scare you. Romero's zombies frighten me in a different way than Snyder's, they are shuffling mindless prolific husks who keep coming, ever so slowly to eat you. Snyder's zombies are gory bloody hungry and running at you full speed, they are more like animals, but you don't dare pet them.

 I went into Dawn of The Dead expecting to leave disappointed, I thought that it would be a fumbling mess of clich&eacute;s and quick camera work and bad acting. I was so blown away by it that I couldn't believe what I had just seen. It was like going into the ""tunnel of blood"" at the county fair and the Paper Mache monsters had come to life.  The music was right (and that is so important!), the actors were amazing especially Sarah Polley and Jake Weber. It had slick jokes, mind blowing special effects and I swear I left nail marks permanently in my husbands arm because I was so scared. I was whipped around emotionally, my heart was in my throat, and I was so completely satisfied I almost wept with joy. You really have to get the Unrated Directors cut to get the whole experience; the extra features on the disc were worth it. I love a good commentary.

 The only bad part of the whole movie, and I see that other reviewers have pointed this out, was the zombie baby. My problem is the baby itself, not that I am upset by it, just that the effects used weren't good enough so I wouldn't have even tried it. It is really hard to do anything scary with babies without them being animatronically laughable or in this case mediocre CGI.",1191283200,,2875,4.413207547169812

2065956,5,B00027SIUK,"I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.

While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.

Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.

I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.

First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.

DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.

The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardizes the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.

There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them 'in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.

Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the 'fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say 'crikey!' Yes, the 'turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.

I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.

This UNRATED HD DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.

Filmed in Super-35 the HD DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 1080P widescreen with Dolby THD sound. The picture is flawless and Zack Snyder's high contrast, blown-out cinematography looks utterly perfect. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman, The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed, Special Bulletin: We Interrupt This Program!-complete news coverage of the attacks, deleted scenes, Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads.

NOTE: This 'unrated' HD-DVD is NOT the Director's Cut. The DC lasts 110 minutes while this one barely makes it to 109. A few lines of dialogue are snipped here and there and the naked woman on the freeway has been 'covered up' with bloodstains. Why, I don't know.",1188259200,24,6048,4.782567049808429

Now, don't you think that was kind of strange?  If you are going to hide, the mall is one of the last places of resort.  Well I can understand that it is a movie so we need some action followed by a showdown and rescue.  The extra features are so fun and they have the video diary of this goofball who was on the adjacent roof.  This guy was starving to death which of course can show you how even the humans are not always prepared.  I am sure he had some eco friendly water around but realized it was better used to keep the toilet from reeking.  Then it also shows the importance of owning a gun so that you can protect yourself when attacked, because in real life as well as this movie, the police are reactive and not proactive.

This film made me fall in love with the zombie genre, and this is my favorite zombie film. I liked all of the characters, even the ones that are annoying, there was no gaudy sex that you see rampant through horror movies. There were no scenes that had me rolling my eyes. The romance that was there was much more realistic than in most movies, not just horror. And, most importantly, the zombies looked good. Also, I was pleasantly surprised about the music. ""Get Down With the Sickness"" ""Man Comes Around"", it all fit so well. At the same time, there were ironic peices like ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"".

I read an interview with the Director of this movie, and when asked about setting the movie in a mall, the director said that the mall was just a location and any other location would have worked just as fine.  Now look, when you're using the title, ""Dawn of the Dead"", you better remake it great, I mean really great.  The followers of Romero do not hand out free passes as easily as the GP.  You know, I might not have had that big of a problem with this movie if the title were different.  Definately not when the same.

2065967,5,B00027SIUK,"As an academic, I'm supposed to tell you how Snyder destroyed Romero's original message about consumerism. And I'm supposed to tell you that he rewrote one of the most important lines of the film: when asked why the zombies are flocking to the mall, Stephen replies, ""Some kind of instinct. Memory, of what they used to do. This was an important place in their lives."" Synder's alteration is a bastardization of the original . . . and lacks ""punch.""

But, SERIOUSLY, who cares?!! The fact of the matter is . . . I love this film! The casting was FANTASTIC!! Rhames brings depth to a character in which few actors could find depth (he portrays a stoic police officer who's brother is trapped on an infected military-base). This man is a LEGEND!! Likewise Polly and Weber add ""soul"" to this film about the ""souless"" (their characters find love amidst the bloody carnage. . . and, yes, it sounds cheesy, but it is low-key, well-done). Furthermore, Burrell's character is wonderfully unlikeable (though it is the ""Apocalypse,"" he still believes that his bank-account grants him privilege! You actually find yourself HOPING that this guy will die!!) Finally, Kelly's portrayal of CJ is genuinely complex . . . watch for a great ""fifth-act conversion""!!

What REALLY engaged me in this film was the cinematography. While a film need not have a huge budget to be a success, this film proves that it doesn't hurt either!! The film quality is top-notch!! The helicopter shots are GORGEOUS!! And the use of color is exquisite. If you want to see a beautifully rendered horror-film, this is it!!

The conclusion is disheartening (without revealing too much information). It marks a new trend in horror. Now, the ""real"" conclusion is couched in the credits . . . which reveals the director's hesitance (and, no, it's not a tactic to make the audience watch the credits). It is radically different from the 1978 ending. Some people love it . . . some hate it. (We have also seen this ""problem"" with Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" . . . in America we received the ""happy"" ending and weeks later, the ""unhappy"" ending . . . directors rightly fear to offer a genuinely dark ending . . . it will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves!!)

Wow!

Cannibalism, the dead coming back to life, overwhelming odds...  It's tempting to catalogue how many primordial fears this premise might tap into, but where the film succeeds most is the skillful way it turns its comic book story line into good drama.

Having isolated themselves in a locked-down shopping mall, having survived and fortified against an assault of ravenous predators, the survivors must now overcome the obstacles of their conflicting personalities.  Right off the bat, it's clear that some of these human holdouts are every bit as dangerous to their companions as the ocean of ghouls outside.

And it isn't always the base and abusive elements of human nature that get them in trouble.  Otherwise admirable acts of bravery, compassion and self-sacrifice, occasionally lead to horrific results.  One of the film's recurrent themes is a suggestion that traits we normally accept as laudable turn out to be dangerous weaknesses when the context of civilization isn't there for support.

None of this, fortunately, tips the film's balance away from the action/horror element that is it's rightful draw.  A skillful remake of George Romaro's 1979 offering, the film never wanders far from the physical action and visual mayhem that make movies an ideal medium for this kind of story in the first place.  There are parts that leave you squirming, parts that gross you out, parts that are perversely funny, and parts profoundly sad.

Moreover, there's a permeable and relentless sense of doom just around the corner, and the zombies fast and frightening,  like crazed animals tearing the flesh of screaming victims in a frenzy...  Yikes!

Well, actually, you really can, kinda.

I figured I'd give this a shot even though I loathe the fact everything seems to be a remake these days.  The selling point was that John Carpenter's 'The Thing' was essentially a remake and that was one of my all time favorites.

The first half of 'Dawn"" works pretty well.  Despite the fact that I'm not sure that the Director of Photography brought any lighting for any of the interior shots and they stole the leftover zombies from '28 Days Later' (they are shot the same, act the same, sound the same, look the same, and have that hirky-jerky MTV shaky camera thing going for them), it moves pretty well and it manages to give you a jump even when you're expecting something to happen.  Not to mention the outstanding car-makes-impact-with zombie and zombie-gets-nailed-in-the-head-by-weapon thing.  very good.

Bring a animal into a film and it's a recipe for disaster.  This film takes a turn for the worse when the Collie shows up.  When one of the characters chases after a dog she just met eleven hours beforehand because she thinks it might be hurt by, I don't know, the 1100 zombies outside...it triggers a series of bad decisions by the characters.  So many bad decisions that not even the weapon-to-head thing can save it.

It's another tragic girl chases after stray dog-group chases after girl chasing stray dog story, really.  Very sad.  Even the explosions started getting annoying.  each one looked like there was at least 20 more pounds of C-4 to them.  These Regular Joe's become demolition experts all of a sudden.

I can look past that a little bit because people in Wisconsin, regardless of employment, know a lot about weapons.  People catch carp there just to nail them to trees.  That's a true story.

Too many bad mistakes and cliches toward the ending of this film to recommend purchasing it.  The funniest thing about the entire production are these 'islands' they're traveling to on Lake Michigan.  Islands that look like they have limestone cliffs.  The kind you find in Thailand.  The Crew must have forgotten this was supposed to take place in Wisconsin, I guess.  You can see palm trees in the background during the last sequence.",1162339200,3,2394,4.736077481840193

The action is way, way more exciting. The special effects are superb (but then, that's to be expected with today's technology). But on top of that, the dialogue is much sharper, with some really cool, almost throwaway, lines - like the exhange in the stairwell between Micheal and Ken regarding Michael's expertise with a gun. Plus, the characters are much better realised - you don't care about all of them, but you do care about the few that really matter.

of course not! so why do the bozos who made this movie want people to think that walking dead people can run fast?  SHEESH!

The biggest part of the movie was while the people were trapped in the mall. they find that there's another guy in a surplus store on the other side of the parking lot who's still alive as well. Between them is a couple hundred zombies. I about busted a gut laughing when the people in the mall held up a sign that read ""Jay Leno"" and the guy across the parking lot took his rifle and picked off a zombie that looked like Jay Leno. There were several moments of levity throughout the movie.

For my part, I was thoroughly disgusted by the birth scene. True, it hadn't been done before, but it was truely disturbing.

Now I originally saw this in the theatre one night. Right afterwards, I went to the mall which was just across the street. Let me tell you, after seeing this movie and entering a mall right afterwards, it felt weird. Nervous you might say. I kept staring at the normalcy going on around me.

2065977,4,B00027SIUK,"With movies like the Hills Have Eyes, Dawn of the Dead, and to a lesser extent The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, remakes are clearly showing signs of improvement. Whatever the reason, horror movies in general have seen a resurgence in the past three or four years the likes of which haven't been seen since the '80's. Not that the slew of remakes shows greater innovation than the post-golden age of horror mind you, but the laws of probability assure greater chances of quality when accompanied with greater quantity.

Amidst the blood thirsty crowds of die hard Romero fans, Hollywood went ahead with the remake of arguably the most renowned zombie film thus far. A much different beast than its predecessor, the new Dawn runs at a breakneck pace the original never came to. Zombies forego the greenish tint of the first film in place of remarkable special effects that don't dissapoint. No more plodding either; these zombies jump and run like rabid monkeys the second they kick off. This only adds to the intensity and the last third of the movie quickly assuaged my earlier qualms with the lack of character depth.

The plot of the Romero's film is loosely carried over to the remake. A women who recently lost a loved one meets up with several others during her escape, a cop, a man and his pregnant girlfriend/wife, and another man who doesn't reveal much of himself until later(and even then his development is so shallow it's too pathetic to dwell on). Needless to say, the group find shelter in a local mall, which appears to be abandoned until they find themselves to be less than welcomed. Where it heads from there should be seen to be believed.

As you may have gathered by now, Dawn of the Dead is sorely lacking in character development, eschewing the social commentary and brooding apocalyptic mood for a non-stop gorefest that leave your heart in a perpetual state of pounding. Fortunately, it works, and I can't remember the last time I have seen such a emotionally void movie still be so enjoyable. It's key lies in avoiding the pitfalls of far too many hollywood movies: sentimentality that downright insults the sensibilities of it's viewers. Don't misunderstand, their is the usual reflection and mourning upon the deaths of loved ones, but it is fleeting and only placed intermittently.

There's something wrong in the world today when a remake of a Romero film can be superior to a recent film of said director, but alas, such is the case. Land of the Dead is a poor offering from the master of horror, but this film almost makes up for it. Two rotten thumbs way up Romero's you know what, I say!",1157932800,4,2616,4.730263157894737

Dawn 78 is slow but very fun, Dawn 04 is fast but kinda dull, thanks to the survivors' constant dialog of former days working at Best Buy, coffee, relationships and whatnot as they sit around ""Hallow Grounds"" coffee hut in the mall (which we don't see enough of due to too many closeups). When they're not talking, the zombie action is pretty good, if you don't mind fast zombies like from ""Nightmare City"".

TONS of zombies, plenty of headshots, plenty of gore and a few small feasting scenes, but pales compared to ""Dawn of the Dead 78"".

They don't keep your attention. Since I saw this, every horror film Ive seen after it Ive been comparing to it. To see if it has the same effect as this movie you know?

You can't make a modern zombie film without referencing George Romero; it's just impossible. So, for me, the most startling aspect of this so-called ""remake"" was its originality.

The movie first departs from genre by using a well-known, talented cast. Serious business. Sarah Polley's name, all by itself, is enough to signal the viewer that this is supposed to be ""art."" And ... oddly enough ... it is.

Where the original Dawn of the Dead deftly sent up crass commercialism and garish greed with a mindless mall mentality that survives death itself, this version takes on deeper, more personal aspects of a societal breakdown. Love isn't enough to save any family in this film. Not even the family members survivors choose for themselves. This brings a deeply tragic element to this film that owes more to the original Night of the Living Dead than to any of that film's offspring.

This Dawn of the Dead works on other, lighter, levels as well. I don't want to spoil the moment, but ""Jay Leno"" actually made me laugh out loud.

Theories of government are explored, as is the importance of a good coffee shop. All in all, a well-thought out, well-executed, layered horror movie that delivers much more than expected on all levels.",1148774400,,1339,4.859649122807017

 This movie starts with action and does a decent job of keeping it going the entire time. What I like about this movie is that thay show the crazyness that could happen if this were to happend in the US and the world.

 This should have been the version that thay put out in theaters. We do wish they'd put in a little more T&A though, we're pretty sure the director must have shot some.

In the final judgment this movie gets a pretty solid 4 star rating. It doesn't hit 5 simply because it isn't the type of thing you're going to just pop into the DVD player over and over again.

It really has the next generation flavor that we were hoping for. The zombies are faster, meaner and much more kinetic which is just fine. Since the updated representation of zombies from ""28 days Later"", faster agressive zombies seems to be the way to go. Strangely though, when I saw this at the theatre I had a few reservations. They were all taken care of in the ""Unrated"" version. So really the Unrated version is strongly recommended! Also a special mention to Kyle Cooper's intro title work, which really set up the mood nicely. 5 stars for overall satisfaction.

2066015,4,B00027SIUK,"There is one marked difference between this and some other movie I've seen that's also called Dawn of the Dead. And I'm not just talking about plot differences, because in essence, this is a completely different film from the original Dawn, and there's not much point in comparing the two. But I think one of the differences in the way the plague is presented greatly affects the tone of this film, so I'll spell it out here before I discuss this movie as a whole. The difference of which I speak is this: No one knows if this is a virus or not, that's causing the dead to come back to life, but in this film, that's about the only thing that it could be, because the dead only rise if they've been killed by zombie bites. so it's not that all the dead have risen and will continue to rise. In the original Dawn, no one knew why the dead were coming back to life, but ALL the dead were rising, not just those who had been bitten by zombies. In this film, the infection (or whatever it is) is only spread by zombie bites...which leads one to wonder how the first person became infected, before there WERE any zombies.

As annoying as that may be when pondered after the film is over, though, it's beside the point, and it really doesn't affect the central story of these main characters, because they make for a good movie nonetheless. Plot holes aside, this is one of the best horror movies I've seen in awhile.

The opening is top-notch. There are foreshadowings of horrific events to come, but people don't notice them at first, because everything seems to be under control. The hospital has a lot of patients today, but no one has noticed anything too terrible just yet. We're treated to an endearing married couple, and despite my best efforts not to become attached to one of the characters (because the trailer for the film gives away what happens), I LIKED these characters, and I was saddened when the inevitable happened.

After a close call escape and horrific images of a world gone mad, our lead character, Ana, meets up with some other survivors who are battle-weary themselves. For no apparent reason other than the fact that it's conveniently close to where they've all met up, the characters decide to take shelter in the local mall. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the tru strength of any zombie movie lies in its portrayal of what people will do when the world is falling apart around them. We have it all here. Take-charge types using what little authority they have to strongarm everyone around them, using their weaponry to get what they want. Nurturing, motherly types who want to care for the sick, and others who just want to survive. Realizing that the disease is spread through infected bites leads to some poignant scenes where characters have to continue caring for the sick or kill them before they become the living dead. New relationships are forged, other survivors are rescued, and the group gets tired of waiting, deciding to try to take shelter elsewhere rather than stay in the mall until food runs out.

It's interesting watching people fall apart and decide how to put themselves back together. Since Ana was a nurse before the world went mad, she becomes a nurse again, caring for the wounded. One character wants nothing more than to raise a family with his pregnant wife, and this gets in the way of other concerns, blinding him to what is going on around him. The fatherly figure who can calmly talk down anyone, even the power-mad security guard with a gun, says that being a dad is the thing he was best at in his life---and it shows. The story is cluttered with a lot of characters, and we don't get to know them all, but they all have human traits that make them endearing.

I don't know why some people have a problem with the way the zombies look...they're effectively icky and drippy looking, sadistic in their violent attacks on the living, and it doesn't bother me when they run. Actually, the zombies do a lot of standing and walking, unless they're pursuing prey, so the running doesn't affect my opinion on them. As long as they're handled well, I don't care if my zombies walk or run. The CGI in this movie isn't too intrusive. There are only a few times that it's so noticable that it is irritating, and that's during the expolsive fire scenes. Otherwise the makeup is cool, and there's plenty of gore (my audience was half full of gorehounds who'd cheer every time someone got splattered and half full of people who'd cover their faces and moan every time this happened. It was great). Once the main cast is pared down to the band of survivors, they're loyal to each other, even rescuing people who are endangered by their own stupidity.

There are some shaky elements, like the character who sets off a bomb and is swept over by fire but remains unburned, but little things like that don't bother me too much. This film doesn't flinch away from disturbing realities that other movies might not show, like a speeding escaping van crashing into a speeding escaping car, or a character accidentally slicing into another character because he lost his balance. The only thing that really made me want to throw bricks at the screen was the shaky-cam ending montage that looks like the cast crashed into the set of House of the Dead or something. That was unneeded, and I think I'll end future showings of the film after the end credits begin to roll, because the rest is unnecessary. This is a totally different film from the original Dawn, and judged on its own terms, I think it's a very good, entertaining zombie movie. A lot of people don't like it. I did. 8/10",1135641600,3,5628,4.572844400396432
2066016,2,B00027SIUK,"Anyone who's the average Joe of the world and not a newspaper critic (or other two most famous critics that seem to give all movies ""Two thumbs [way] up!"" in TV spots for most films), probably went to the movie theater more than you'll admit to in 2004 to see the holy grail batch of summer blockbuster movies (Spider-Man, I, Robot, Resident Evil Apocalypse, Shaun of the dead, yada-yada) and probably went to see more than one Zombie movie that year. That said, I just got over my fear of watching The Resident Evil series, and my brother is determined to watch every ""zombie movie with word 'dead' in the title."" Thus, I happened to end up watching ""Dawn of the Dead"" on more than one occasion when it was released on TV. I never wanted to see this movie because mainly, It did very unlogical things with the pop-culture icons, and horror movies still are not my cup of tea. I ended up watching this movie with my brother because of three factoids: 1): Jake Weber (who I've noticed for a while but never really paid attention to until ""MEDIUM"" aired); 2): Mekhi Phifer (I watch ""ER"" too); and 3): Ving Rames (He ruled in M:I/MI:2 and Rosewood).

That said, I have to say that this film could've been way better if it had focused less on the Blood and Gore fest that was going on about throughout the movie and more on the characters. I can't really complain, Blood and Gore is what zombie movies are all about! I digress on this note. Its pretty obvious that movie decides to take hold of the ""Resident Evil (game or movie)"" shtick and make the viewer think that a man-made virus - supposedly from outer space - has killed millions within a short period of time and reanimated their bodies into ravenous, flesh eating speedy-gonzales zombies. While this gives the movie more of a boost in the horror factor, this really wasn't that convincing unless the directors aim was make them more ""cannibal"" than ""undead."" Which is the thing that bothered me, the running zombie shtick was silly and laughable. If they're dead and decayed (assuming they were dead for long), theur reanimated bodies would be limping along because the motor skills would be damaged and not completely functional due to little or no brain activity. Thus, the reasons as to why they moan and shuffle along is pretty clear.

The Running Zombies, though scary in its own way, really look like crazed ""living"" people (See: Batman Begins) looking to rip a new one in you (Its even worse in ""Land of the Dead"" where the Zombies THINK and they're D-E-A-D), therefore killing the creepy atmosphere given off by staggering zombies. Instead of being told by heroes (via Ash and his boomstick) that are usually in zombie movies, this movie tells the point of view of a few city citizens that are stuck in the middle of a self-proclaimed war zone that has the means and ways to kill them with the use of its own citizens now long dead. The single-named characters, Michael, Ana, Andre, Luda, CJ, Vincent, and many others seek refuge in a local mall and pray that they aren't killed by each other or the undead during the course of their stay within the temporary stronghold. This is what happened in the old movie though this remake extends beyond the mall despite the fact that's where most of the movie takes place before the end.

If you Fast-Forward through the sex scenes, try to bear the unbearable vulgar language coming out of the most of the actors mouths and don't mind the massive amount of blood and gore provided by the zombies eating people or zombies being sawed in half, then you'll probably find this movie enjoyable. I, on the other hand get squirmy and look away at such display of phony blood and violence. One gripe with the film itself is the contrast and color of the film is presented in: its almost too bright to keep your eyes on the screen for a few moments without taking a blink or two. The movie has its saving grace through funny moments its has, ultimately leading the viewer into a state of calm and peace. The characters engage in normal activities in the mall, golfing, watching tv, among other things. One particular moment such as the scene when Michael and Andre hyping themselves up to open a door and find out its locked the next, cracked me right up. The major problems I had with this movie was the ambiguous ending and the simple fact that the GOVERNMENT did not blow all the zombie infested areas to kingdom come (it seemed quite illogical to me). That would've been cool though I guess that would be taking to much from the ""Resident Evil"" Shtick. Overall, this movie wasn't bad; It scared me more than the Resident Evil movies did. Only watch this movie if your an avid fan of old man George A. Ramano zombie flicks --something I am not-- or other reasons. ---- [a 2 out of 5]",1135209600,,4783,4.546403712296984

While there were some political undertones to Romero's movies, this has only one underlying theme.  Run.  Run as fast as you can for as long as you can.  No shots at consumerism, or conservatism, or communism.  Just get safe, fast.

It seems a rag tag band of survivors of a zombie holocaust hole up in the local shopping mall.  They fight, have their own little power struggles, but most importantly survive.

Whether it is taking pot shots at the undead with sporting goods or high-powered rifles, you gotta pass the time, right?

2066018,5,B00027SIUK,"I rarely write reviews for anything -- but I thought I'd let any other fans of this genre know that, if you're on the fence about checking this out, it was much, much, much better than I expected, and completely eclipses ""28 Days Later"" in terms of approach and intensity.

As many have pointed out, the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" is often advertised as an intense horror flick, but is really more of a dark comedy -- a bit goofy and dated, these days.  Romero's next flick, ""Day of the Dead,"" I thought was better & more involving, as far as the genre goes.  But I gave up on seeing this ""DotD"" remake after ""28 Days"" was such rubbish.  Where to begin?  In this new ""Dawn of the Dead,"" yes, the zombies are sprinters, just like in ""28 Days"" -- which is a necessary upgrade from the staggerers, in keeping the protagonists trapped.  But unlike ""28 Days,"" which spoils any tension by having lots of speed metal guitar and post-produced faux-camera-shake, ""DotD"" has very convincing ""mob of zombies"" choreography (sorry, don't know quite how else to put it) which holds up on its own without excessive post-production tricks.  Also, in ""28 Days,"" the script was a complete wash-out -- whenever the writer knew that a scene would not result in a zombie attack, the characters would somehow magically know this as well, and would get off a bunch of cheery one-liners -- example: one of the most frightening places in a zombie-plagued city would be, of course, any kind of large store, with lots of long aisles and restricted vision and all that.  In ""28 Days,"" since the writer did not plan a zombie attack in the market, he has the characters happily shopping & pushing their little shopping carts around, cracking screenwriter-showing-off jokes at each other, bright as a summer's day -- not even having checked the market out first with guns drawn -- you know, the obvious ""this whole city is filled with zombies, maybe we should be careful going into this deserted market"".  Nope.  The market is magically safe, because the script knows that it is going to be safe.  This is so wrong-headed a dramatic choice, words can hardly convey.  But here in ""DotD,"" every bit of the city (& the mall in particular) is a complete threat until the characters fully investigate, so you keep the tension nice & simmering.  Plus, add to that the really fantastic casting, with actors who are more concerned with conveying the experience of their fictional situation & not simply trying to get themselves noticed, and a script that strives for twists & tension, not sassy one-liners & fakey speeches & other TV-type infections, and a director who keeps his actors at a high-quality low boil, but who can also really flip the visual style switch when necessary (check out the creative choices made during the end credits -- fascinating) . . . and lo and behold, as much as I expected this flick to be another member of the whole ""28 Days"" crowd of bumbling Nike-commercial-meets-gore attempts, I was utterly stunned by how compelling this flick was.  This is a zombie flick given not only the royal treatment of an apparently decently-sized budget (just guessing here, but it looks rather well-funded), but also guided by a writer, director and actors who are committed to the flavor of, ""What if this really happened?""

2066019,4,B00027SIUK,"Those original Romero zombies --slow, relentless, and visibly hungry-- are already one of the scariest things I hope to ever see.  So when I heard that the zombies can RUN in the new one, I thought, That'll just give me a heart attack.

The opening sequences (including the credits) are one scary bit of film, and the rest of the movie lives up to that tone throughout.  This is a shocker from start to finish, virtually guaranteed to freak you out.

Romero's original ""Dawn of the Dead"" was something special: simultaneously a great horror film, a great black comedy (on par with ""Doctor Strangelove"") and a truly mean piece of black-hearted Swiftian social satire.  In short, it's a bona-fide work of art, with a lot more 'Artistic' merit than any number of costumey, old-timey Merchant-Ivory films.  The new film can't possibly live up to this tall order, so wisely, they don't even try -- instead they just make a hard-core, lock-and-load, scary scary movie.  Which is hard enough to do.  It's not profound, but it's pretty compelling.

The one thing that mars the film is the truly tasteless and blameworthy sub-plot about a pregnancy.  The actors should have simply refused to participate in this segment.  Some things just shouldn't be put on film, ever, and this movie has one of them.  Find where your fast-forward button is, and USE it.  It's really too bad someone didn't have the brains and the courage to refuse this sequence.",1131753600,,1439,4.800813008130081

Alot of people say that this remake is too different than the first Dawn Of The Dead film. It's a remake, you're suppose to make a change and still keep the feeling of the original. The Thing remake is way different from The Thing From Another World. And The Fly remake is also way different from The Fly {1958}.

Then, some people talk about the zombies running in this film, saying that was too crazy. Zombies aren't real in the first place, so what if they ran. Besides, this isn't the first film with running zombies, remember Nightmare City and The Return Of The Living Dead? They ran in those films.

The characters in this film are cool, especially Kenneth {Rhames}, Michael {Weber} and CJ {Kelly}. Also, it has one of the best last fight scenes of all time. For one, the scene when CJ throws the propane gas tank and one of the zombies catch it, he grabs his shotgun and shoots the propane gas tank. After that, a huge explosion comes and knocks down 1000 zombies sso they can pass through them.

What makes a film great is a great ending, and the ending of this film is disturbing and cool.

The Original Dawn was much better than this ""remake"".This remake is more like a retelling of sorts. They should've left the Dawn title out of it and create their own zombie picture in the same way. The characters who come in the middle were unnecessary,making the movie pace a lot slower than it was originally. I enjoyed Land of the Dead better than this. In the 110 minutes of the film,the zombies only appear for about four sequences in great numbers,and with no gore and just splashing blood,it doesn't satisfy the hardcore gore fan at all.

2066022,2,B00027SIUK,"OK, is there any possible reason to watch yet another Zombie movie?  We've had  `Day of the Dead', `Night of the Living Dead', Return OTLD 1,2 & 3, Hell OTLD, City OTLD, Erotic Nights OTLD, Fangs, OTLD, Hood OTLD, Children OTLD, Tea Time OTLD, Nap Time OTLD, ad nauseam.  You probably get my point.

Why the fascination with Zombies, people who die and then return to a form of animation between death and life and with a sole uncontrollable desire to eat Human Flesh?  Why?

After my coworker, Doug J, asked me repeatedly to watch this movie, I relented, waited until my wife and children were out of range and surrendered 2 unrecoverable hours of my life to it.

Settling down with 2 liters of diet soda, I went into this with an open, nearly blank, mind.

The premise is that an extremely fast-acting virus with, what appears to be a 100% morbidity and mortality rates of unknown origin begins to spread.  This virus rapidly kills the victim and in moments they return to 'life' with a raving desire to eat 'warm human flesh'?  Why?  Maybe it tastes like chicken, who knows.  It would be natural, though as that is how the virus is spread.

Taking the high road, we can examine the reactions of people when placed in a terrible situation.  What if you woke up and, in a reverse-Kafka transformation, everyone around you have become an animal, a raving lunatic?  This is the situation in which the handful of survivors find themselves.  Each of them reacts according to their own personality, training and values. Could this be a metaphor for our very own world?  A violent, increasingly confusing and dangerous world?  A world where trust is a scarce commodity? Maybe - who knows?

Why the fascination with human-become-animal, the beast released?  It tugs the string tied to the deep-seated knowledge that we all walk a fine line between civilization and animal. We all carry the beast within.

How does the director convey these concepts to the audience?  Well, in this case, through lots and lots and lots of gratuitous gore and violence and shocking scenes.  The herky-jerky fast-motion camera style makes these zombies more effective than the (few) previous cellulous zombies I have encountered.  These full-speed mindless creatures congregate at the local mall - hmmmm, probably another social comment - while our heroes plan their escape from said mall.  We see lots of biting, chopping, shooting, incineration, inpaling, vehicular, explosion, sniping and chainsaw deaths.  There is also the pregnant zombie who of course delivers a baby zombie.  Very, very gory and violent.

Uncontrollable cannibalism also reaches out to our very reasonable taboo of killing and eating other humans.

Would I recommend this movie?  No, of course not.  Unless you have a virus-induced zombie-like compulsion to consume these sorts of things.  In that case, this is a 5-star movie.",1131321600,4,2875,4.925

It has what 98% of horror/sci-fi movies are missing, a gripping storyline and above average acting. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames really did a good job. Having grown up on and disecting the Romero films I now find the gore to be of secondary importance.

  Shock, human interaction, and an uncertainty of this weird happening are what holds the movie together well. I saw this in the theatres in 2004. What Night of the Living Dead captured with it's TV reports and unique fear, Dawn 2004 capitilized on. Thats why it worked so well. The main thing is that it made you think while holding the action. It had a few weak or rather bad moments, the baby birth seen didn't need to be there, it was cheasy to me. But back to basics, being chased in a mall by hundreds of flesh ripping zombies is strangely facinating. I liked this movie better then Land of the Dead even though they show two different types of zombies. The old school is good, but this new era of zombie is fast paced with that bizzare world ending feel. The first 15 minutes of the movie should grab any sci-fi buff without question.

2066099,5,B00027SIUK,"Why are all the Dead coming back to life? And why are they all rabid Atkins Diet freaks?

Zach Snyder's brilliant 2004 remake of George Romero's groundbreaking ""Dawn of the Dead"" takes up the material of the original, dusts it off, injects it with a syringe chock-full of creepiness, splatter, gore, and raw adrenaline, and goes off-roading into the dark desert of the Apocalypse.

This is better than Romero's original. It is terrifying. It makes your jaw drop. It is, possibly, the only cinematic rendering of the Apocalypse I have ever found even remotely believable, and let me tell ya, fellow troopers---every second I was riding shotgun with Sarah Polley's heroine. And given what I saw---flesh-eating monsters tearing up law-abiding home-owners in living color on their front lawns---I had a really itchy trigger finger.

""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" made me afraid. Very afraid.

Let me make this clear: this is the scariest film I have ever seen. Your heart will race. Your blood pressure will rise. Look at the opening credits alone, that grim parade of brutal bloody images of atrocity accompaniesd by Johnny Cash's dismal and revelatory ""The Man Comes Around"". Yeh, this is the real thing, Old Hoss. Lock and load, yeah; but don't hide. They'll find you and eat you if you hide.

In an amazing debut for a novice director, Zack Snyder shoves us mercilessly from the sublime (even boring) into the ridiculous. No, not ridiculous: he shoves us from the everyday commonplace world of adorable skating little girls and 24-hour supermarkets and fast-food and pizza delivery into a latter-day hellscape where your next door neighbor busts down your door in the wee hours of the morning and uses your brainpan as a sausage sampler.

I expected nothing when I walked into ""Dawn of the Dead"", other than 90+ minutes of gut-chewing escapism. Within the first 5 minutes of Snyder's masterwork, I was hooked: my eyes bugged out, my heart pounding.

Feel the fear when Ana's (played by the gorgeous, gracious, calm as a bomb Sarah Polley) car smashes into a tree after her narrow escape from being breakfast in her own home. Seriously. Put yourself there. Snyder captures the sort of raw danger only a select few of us feel once in a lifetime, and then only in street riots or war zones.

How does Snyder compare to Romero's classic? He takes all that material, pillages Romero's brain cells, and surpasses anything the Old Master accomplished in any of his ""Dead Trilogy"".

Snyder's 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a nihilistic classic of gut-chewing horror, and blew me away in its total rebel yell against decency. We get ample flesh chewing. We get a hideously fat old woman in a ridiculously skimpy negligee (who has, mind you, been hauled into the mall where our heroes take refuge---hauled into the mall in a WHEELBARROW) hankering for flesh and demonstrating all the right moves.

We get a stone-cold gang-banger Andre (played to the 9MM by the talented Mekhi Phifer) who thinks he got to live in this world to bring his baby into it---and cruelly, nastily, gets his wish.

There isn't a single character who lets the flick down: Polley goes from normalcy to hellscape with soldierly resolve. Ving Rhames (Officer Kenneth) dominates the shattered landscape and totally owns the movie. Ty Burrell (yachtsman and resident cynic Steve) and Michael Kelly (security guard turned Mall Hitler CJ) provide a generous helping of humanity at its worst.

But let's focus, for a moment, on the true bloody glory of this remake that actually manages to surpass the original: doesn't it feel like Death to you? The Death of Humanity? The Death of Normalcy? The death of going down to the Mall to pick up a CD or videogame and then heading back home to the burbs for a little sleep?

The DVD is locked and loaded, too: my personal faves are gunshop owner Andy's video diary and ""We Interrupt this Program"", part compilation of the slice-and-diced news broadcasts sampled in the movie, part ambitious little indie-film. It's a bit rough around the edges, but taken on its own terms adds depth to the Last Days.

Snyder has turned out a classic little flick that goes well beyond the frontiers of the typical flesh-eater outing, and ventures far into the dark territory of the Apocalypse. Golf clubs, the mall rooftop, Richard Cheese's swing rendition of Disturbed's ""Down with the Sickness"", and some of the sickest, droolingest, flesh-rottingest zombie nutjobs I have ever seen in my life, and you have an open doorway to Hell that is, for now, entitled ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"".

Lock and load and watch the first step---it's a doozy.

2066100,4,B00027SIUK,"I love the original ""Dead"" series by George Romero. I strayed away from this film for awhile, due to the fact that I'm not a fan of remakes. Anyway, while flipping through channels once, this film was on. So I decided to view this movie, not expecting much of course, however, I was curious about this film. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.

A group of survivors barricade theirselves in a mall when an unknown plague causes the dead to rise and hunt for flesh. They are fine at first, but then they start running out of things they need to stay alive, such as food and electricity, and the zombies begin to find ways to get to them.

The only flaw I thought the film had is: Zombies aren't supposed to run, or twitch. I know movies aren't real, but they still contain certain laws of nature, and a zombie wouldn't be dashing down the street. In the end, I still prefer Romero's masterpiece.

In the remake, none of the characters are likeable. I hated all of them. They were just so lifeless. They were people that simply deserved to die. The attempts at humor were stupid and using tons of humor in a horror movie can only destroy any attempt to make it scary. Another thing, zombies aren't supposed to run. That destroys any tension that we get. If there's a whole army of zombies walking slowly towards you, that increases the fear. I would have to reccomend Land of the Dead over this.

2066125,5,B00027SIUK,"Zach Snyder's 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead is the finest horror movie to be made in quite a while. I fully expected a complete bastardization of George Romero's classic, but this remake stands on its own. The first 15 minutes were beautiful: After a brief introduction to the Sarah Polley character (Anna), Milwaukee is overrun by a sea of flesh eating zombies.

Anna teams up with some other survivors, and they break into a mall for shelter.  Here you have a Village People ensemble: A police officer, a television salesman, a prostitute, a criminal, a nurse, an old gay man, a truck driver, and a rich guy, among others. It is notable that stereotypical scientist/computer geek with all of the answers was not included among this group. I could have stood for a little less diversity. I mean statistically, what are the chances?

In spite of this, there was great chemistry between the actors, as well as some great individual performances. Sarah Polley was a perfect choice for her role. She had a sad, frantic quality that lent itself perfectly to the situation. Michael Kelley was also quite convincing as a the head security guard. It is surprising that his name is not on the cover of the movie. There were a lot of memorable scenes, too many to recount and I would prefer not to ruin the movie for readers who have not seen it. But Zach Snyder definitely has a knack for dreaming up interesting situations that are not exactly like those we've seen in a thousand other movies.

In between the lines, I believe that this Dawn of the Dead remake was about conformity, about the natural tendency of the masses to assimilate nonmembers and force them into a standard mode of existence. In the U.S., there are tax incentives to marry, purchase a home, and have children. 401k programs further incent us to commit to a single employer. Those of us with the mettle to deviate from this model will suffer the constant drumbeat of nagging from family and friends to grow up... and conform. A multitude of economic and psychological signals act like a thousand drops of water, helping individuals fit to socio-cultural norms.  In Dawn of the Dead, all this subtlety and foreplay has been removed, as the zombies have been programmed to attack the living and forcibly convert them on sight. Its possible I'm reading too much into this.

This movie does attempt to be a social satire along the lines of Romero's earlier Dead movies. But Zack Snyder's unique vision for this story was compelling nonetheless, and his innovations will be a source of inspiration for future horror/action directors.",1126828800,2,2595,4.76837416481069

This intended Homage/Cash-In is disjointed and full of unexplained 'well that just happened so accept it' errors - ok, how did the little girl zombie( the nice neighbor girl?) happen to walk into the house while our young couple are asleep - real people lock their doors at night - and how did they not get awakened by all the explosions and screaming chaos outside the house ? Hey, we can hear next doors puppy barking and in best Little Pigs tradition our house is made of bricks!

Parking lot zombie that shins down the overhead pipes to attack them - er, well, just HOW does a zombie WITH BOTH LEGS MISSING manage to get up in the ceiling in the first place ? ( "" Hey gimme a hand up then when they come out I'll be just waiting up here - "")Maybe he just called the Director over for a boost-up?

Anyone ever wondered why these zombies are wandering around with wounds that would have had most of the blood in their bodies gone ? Does the blood mysteriously coagulate so this does not happen about 10 seconds after a victim is bitten ? That being so - ok - then HOW can it be possible to stagger around - let alone run - with stiff veins and arteries ? Questions,questions -

HOW are there zombies inside a locked up Mall ??? Not in the underground parking lot which MAY have an open entrance - one is a janitor in store ( as per Romeros original ) other is a security guard - "" Well, Im bit - but Im going to work anyway noone will notice - - ""

Sarah Polley portrays a nurse who comes home to find something terribly wrong with her young daughter. The daughter bites and kills her husband, who ""awakens"" to try to attack his wife. Now our heroine tries to escape, only to find the community around her is filled with similarly reanimated decedants (zombies!) She finds shelter in the local mall, along with other survivors, who find themselves being held captive by a couple of fringe-lunatic mall security guards. Their only objectives now are to stay alive and find somewhere to escape where there are no ""victims"".

Mostly I mean that in the old film (like in many old ones) some things look rather ridiculous, for example fight scenes - they sometimes seem unnatural and childish. Special effects were as they were in 1978. But I repeat once more that I love the old one.

Now welcome to the new version - no more fun and games, everything looks real. If a truck overruns a body, it INDEED does so and we see it in every detail, if someone is shot in the head, noone would say: ""Oh, what a lousy attempt by the F/X guys"". Besides the movie is very tense, it's a thriller in all of the word's meaning. It will grip you and won't let go till the very end. You definately will desire to watch it again after while. And again. And again maybe.

Speaking of this DVD edition I have to say it has the best bonus features I have seen to date. ""Andy's last days"" and News coverage of the attacks look like parts of the film that were not included, so it's not just interviews and ""making of"" - it's another half hour of the movie. You'll never regret you bought it.",1125446400,2,1388,4.175373134328358
2066153,4,B00027SIUK,"Although this movie is a good Horror Movie Remake (much much better than the average Remake), there are still some things lacking. In the original, the whole ""mall"" plot was much stronger and felt more realistic, they lived there, but in this movie, it was ""all work and no play""...which made it a little different, but still better.

Since we now have a stronger/more strict MPAA, the brutality from the original is not here, but the gore is still abundant and we get lots of graphic violence, so its not as though all the violence had been cut. But here the violence is more often I think, since its rated R for ""pervasive violence and gore"" there are a lot more scenes with violence.

And of course, there is more sexual content in this movie, since that is what attracts audience so much now - a - days...so we do see several breasts and a sex scene...

The only thing bad that I can say about this movie was this so-called ""unrated"" version dvd. I mean I've watched the dvd several times and I just don't see anything ""unrated"" about it, it just looks exactly the same as the theatrical version.

2066155,5,B00027SIUK,"Certainly standing on par with the other greats of its type (i.e. ""Evil Dead 2"", the ""Resident Evil""s, etc.), the 2004 ""Dawn Of the Dead"" is actually a voracious contender for the crown of the best movie of its kind, and one of the greatest of any genre, period.  This remake actually far surpasses the 1978 original (in my personal opinion that one was never on a level with most of George Romero's other movies.  Certainly not bad though) and is one of the best-made extreme horror movies ever, hands down.  In terms of intensity and sheer visceral carnage it's in the realm of movies like ""The House Of 1000 Corpses"", the best of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""s and the most graphic of the brilliant ""Hellraiser"" saga.

Opening in the early dawn hours with only a few minutes of hints of what's to come before unleashing itself on the screen in an onslaught of the living dead - a faster, more savage breed than has been seen before, except perhaps in ""Return Of The Living Dead"" - it's well known that in both the original and the remake the focus is on a shopping mall where small bands of survivors manage to congregate.  Personally, I think a bit too much has been made of the 'mall hideout as a metaphor for modern society' supposed analogy; rather it's just the most ideal place to make a stand if you're going to have to hole up for a while.  It's big, solid and hard to bust into with all the thick walls, reinforced doors and so on of today; it's high enough off the ground for the roof to provide a lookout for the surrounding area; and it's stocked to the rafters with food and items that can be utilized as weapons in a crisis.  Of course, being hard to bust into and being impossible to bust into are too very different things, and you can't stay locked inside forever, while the zombie hordes are seemingly endless.

The selection of characters gathered into this desperate last stand could not have been chosen better by the filmmakers, nor could the actors and actresses who play them.  The microcosm of society that's brought together is an at-times volatile mix, and the way each character reacts, and the way this little micro-society begins to develop and interact as a whole is extremely interesting, with characters shifting - some for the better and some for the worse - as the situation alternately improves and worsens beyond belief.  As a whole, the group is one that's made up of strangers to each other and reacts to the horror and shock of this literally dawning of the dead in a way one would expect of the human race: some are helpful and form the backbone of strength for the weaker and more helpless members, some react to the situation by being antagonistic and ruthless almost to the point of murderous, and others are planted in the middle, leaving you from the beginning wondering which way they're going to sway.  But ""Dawn Of The Dead"" brings in a ray of hope in that as the survivors become to increasingly depend on one another, and to know one another - sometimes in spite of themselves - the group as a whole starts to sway more towards the attitudes and demeanor of the former type of reactions than the latter two.  It may be a leap of faith that humanity's last vestiges would rally like this, and it's an opposite view than has been seen is some other, less optimistic (but still effective) examples of the genre like ""Day Of The Dead"" but it's powerful, and it's the Only way the vastly outnumbered group has a chance against the undead legions.

Sarah Polley is outstanding as Ana, one of two anchors of both the movie and the group, a powerful female protagonist in the rough vein (but a bit better rounded) of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor character from ""Terminator 2""; one of the unofficial 'leaders' of the survivors and a self-appointed conscience of the group who steadfastly refuses to let the ""leave 'em behind"" mentality of some of the more ruthless team members in the early going prevail.  Ving Rhames is a physical anchor of the group who, when the heavy bloodletting gets going is like the team's tank.  If he had given as close to this performance as possible (within the framework of what the different script would allow) in a thriller, an action movie or especially a straight drama I honestly think he may have been nominated for an Oscar, because he gives Exactly the kind of performance the Academy seems to look for in male leads (not so much in female leads) and does it to perfection; I don't think the Academy is ever going to even look at a movie like this though and even if they did, and secretly loved it, I suspect they'd hesitate to admit it.  Maybe I'm paranoid.  The other performer who stayed in my mind the most is Lindy Booth as Nicole, one of the younger and more naive of the survivors, who brings both a vulnerabilty and a welcome dose of cute appeal to the show - not that Sarah and the other females of the movie aren't hot, but it's the Nicole character's Personality (in addition to her obvious good looks) that make her distinct - at times she's bright-eyed and perky, without coming off as a total ditz, and at other times she's doe-eyed and so terrified it makes it all the more impressive when she charges right into the danger to try and rescue one of the endangered survivors.

Gruesome, bombastic, action-packed (show this to an action movie fan and you might get a convert over to horrordom for life) and intelligent with dashes of romance and sexiness to boot, and some very moving dramatic scenes.  Plus the DVD extras - unlike so many discs it's not just all 'behind-the-scenes' stuff showing how everything is done (I never watch those anyway; don't want to risk them taking some of the magic of movies away) - there are actual short films adding to the experience, including a camcorder-captured log of a survivor who's found refuge elsewhere than in the mall, and an at-times humourous but still chilling 'breaking news' filmreel that over the course of a day tracks the course of the zombies's onslaught on the entire globe.

Tremendously great film, but this uncut masterpiece isn't for the squeamish.  Shockingly horrifying and feels so dead-on Believable.",1122508800,5,6167,4.6034639927073835
2066156,5,B00027SIUK,"Nihilism: The belief that destruction of existing political or social institutions is necessary for future improvement.

The remake of Dawn of the Dead is as close to perfection as a horror movie can get. I can't believe I just wrote that! (especially about a remake). Anyway, Zack Snyder sets the tone of horror right from the opening credits and maintains it through the very last end credit. This is no small task. But, hey this guy's obviously got a pair trying to remake Romero. The cast is perfect, the violence abounds and the message is chilling. Snyder keeps the viewer in a state of suspense throughout the film. Call me sadistic but I love the fact that every single one of these characters gets it in the end. What a horrifying thought, nothing but zombies roaming the earth. As for a social commentary, at this point nihilism may be the only thing left to save our sorry world from mall culture and consumerism. A must see, must own DVD for horror fans.

2066158,4,B00027SIUK,"When I heard some guy named Zack Snyder planned on lensing a remake of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead,"" I chuckled. This chap must really have some heavy-duty cajones, I thought to myself. The fans will eat him up faster than a Romero zombie for daring to tamper with this modern horror classic. And it looks like more than a few fanboys ripped Snyder a new you know what. After viewing the film, and I was going to watch it no matter how poorly it fared with the fans, I'm not going to beat the director over the head. I possess an ability to watch most remakes without overly comparing them to the original effort. I also recognize that Hollywood is a shameless money machine that would remake ""Birth of a Nation"" if they thought it would turn a profit. Moaning and groaning over the fact that someone greenlighted a Romero remake is an exercise in futility. In fact, committing such an unpardonable ""sin"" can have positive benefits. It might, for example, inspire a new generation of moviegoers to watch the original Romero trilogy. A successful remake can also lead to more horror movies in general, a few of which might actually become cult classics in their own right. This is good.

The most important aspect of Snyder's remake is that he didn't attempt to reproduce Romero's classic shot for shot. No Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho"" here, thank heavens. There is a mall where a small group of survivors hide from the hordes of the undead, however, and it all starts with the beautiful Ana (Sarah Polley) in her beautiful little suburban neighborhood roughly several hours before the world goes to hell in a hand basket. The trouble starts in earnest when Ana's significant other suffers a case of...well, zombie-itis after being attacked by a young girl. Then he morphs into a flesheater quicker than you can say ""Romero"" and tries to kill Ana. She manages to escape from the house only to discover her quiet little 'burb now resembles a war zone. Houses burn, people race around in a panic, and the zombies are on the move. Ana lives in Wisconsin, but it soon becomes clear that whatever is going on is starting to assume global dimensions. A virus? A biological weapon of some sort? Who knows? What we do know is that the dead are starting to outnumber the living. Ana won't survive long if she can't find a safe place to hide out. What's a girl to do?

Finding a police officer named Kenneth (Ving Rhames) might help the situation, for starters. Ana and Kenneth soon hook up with a few other stragglers, namely Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant girlfriend Luda (Inna Korobkina), Michael (Jake Weber), and eventually a whole lot of other folks once the group finds their way into a mall. The first order of business is to convince a high-strung security guard, the foul-mouthed and gun toting CJ (Michael Kelly), to let them stay in the building. The tension throttles down a bit once things settle down in the mall, but only for a time. It becomes apparent to the people trapped inside that the whole world has essentially collapsed and, what's far worse for their situation, at least a few million of the newly risen dead seek to enter the very structure in which they reside. Occasional forays through the labyrinthine mall result in skirmishes with zombies that leave a few minor characters dead as doornails. But thanks to a television report that tells our heroes that shooting the zombies in the head will kill them, plans start to percolate. Talk about getting down to a harbor and sailing for an island that will almost assuredly be undead free captures the imagination and soon becomes a reality. Our group will bicker, build really neat weapons to fight off the zombies, and a few will even die in the attempt to grab a few more precious days of life.

""Dawn of the Dead"" is a pretty entertaining movie even if it can't hold a candle to Romero's original epic. That's acceptable, however, because Snyder gives us gallons of gore and some very cool special effects to fill in the cracks. If you're the sort of individual who can't understand the allure of exploding heads, give this movie a pass because we get a bunch of noggins cracking wide open here. We also get lots of gut munching, arterial sprays, and assorted other grotesqueries. Snyder also gives us superfast zombies who can run the 100-yard dash in about two seconds. All of these pluses are wrapped up in a movie that doesn't hesitate to tug at your heart strings--see the scenes involving the tragic fate of Andy at the gun store or Luda's pregnancy--even as the action flies fast and furious. ""Dawn of the Dead"" even sports a few giggles, such as Kenneth and Andy's celebrity shoot-a-thon from their respective positions on the roof of the mall and the gun shop. I could go on and on with all of the neat things that really work in this remake, but you should just go out and pick up a copy on your own. It's a movie worth owning on DVD.

The supplements included on the disc are also worth the price of admission. Deleted scenes, a commentary track with director Snyder and producer Eric Newman, several worthwhile featurettes, and a few other goodies make this DVD a fun ride indeed. I wasn't as impressed with the extra called ""Andy's Terrifying Last Days,"" which I thought was a bit amateurish, but the extra ten minutes of footage--with extra gore--in the director's cut is all to the good. Definitely give Snyder's homage a chance the next time you go to the video store. I hope he makes another zombie picture in the near future.",1121904000,2,5521,4.636363636363637

I wasn't quite scared, but I just felt that I was going to walk out of the theatres and see zombies. I think the reason why this is the case was because it was around 11 or so at night and the movie theatre was in a mall (coincidentally). There was good acting. I actually just saw the original Dawn of the Dead (you should see that too) and I thought it would be the same, it had the same idea, but the remake had a slightly different plotline. So don't get the idea that you're going to see the same movie. Honestly, the remake was very well done. It really showed what a horror such a thing would be. Basically, it's about a group of people try to lock themselves in the mall to avoid contact with the growing number of zombies on the outside world. Don't forget to watch the end (credits). It was a little creepy. I think what had me a little creeped out was not quite the zombies, but the way they showed the chaos on the news in the movie. It was almost like a preview of some similar type of chaos, whether it is biological or a viral outbreak. I know this movie will most likely have a lot of people scared.

2066171,3,B00027SIUK,"This is a very liberal remake since it only shares the very basic premise of the original. The characters and the life they make for themselves in the mall and the zombie physics are all different. I really didn't expect to like this film at all. I figured it would be a brain-dead splatter version of the original. While it definitely has it's fair share of splatter; they didn't totally forget the something more. (Almost, but not entirely) The internal conflict of man vs man is still intact, but the other more subtle nuances like consumerism are completely absent. Everybody is looking out for themselves and not each other, which is what leads to their fall in the end. Then again it might just be coincidental. Most horror fans hate it when I bring up things like this. They don't see it and they don't want to believe that anything exists beyond the surface, it's true though. I saw Romero confirm it in an interview, deal with it. Take for example, the whole zombie baby scene, many thought the scene to be unnecessary. They don't see how the father of that child puts everyone at risk just for the sake of his needs. But if you're the type who rates films on the splatter scale only, then it ranks as a four star movie. You'll never notice the subtleties after all. Not that you'd have read this far if you're a gore junkie. Of course, that whole idea is negated if you're the type that will dismiss a zombie flick just because they run. I wish to take issue  on that one. A zombie can run while the corpse is fresh, they only stiffen up once rigormortis sets in.

Tom Savini should have done the makeup effects for this one. One of the main problems I had with this film was the fact that the zombies run. A zombie is a decaying bag of bones and flesh with nothing more than the most basic of instincts and that is to feed. Thus I thought that zombies wouldn't be able to run, and should throw away their track shoes. George A. Romero was nipped out of a good 4 seconds of his name being in the beginning sequence as compared to everyone else even remotely involved in this film (if you can call it that).

2066176,4,B00027SIUK,"Director Zach Snyder has succeeded in bringing to the screen a faster, hipper version of the original classic told by George Romero in the 70's. Gone are the slow lumbering zombies that were plowed into in the original version and tossed about like rag dolls. In this version, you'd better put your zombie down or it will chase you down full force. The idea is that the recently dead zombies have the capacity to run full-force and their lust for flesh is insatiable. This film, like the original 'Dawn,' never dwells on what caused the phenomenon, but for the uninitiated, something, is causing the recently dead to return to life. In Romero's original 70's version, it was a radioactive

meteor, and it was all the unburied dead that were returning for human flesh. In this version, only those bitten by a zombie carrying the infection, would die and return to life as a flesh eating ghoul. I enjoyed the music choices in the film's soundtrack, Johnny Cash and some other classics. The cast was very likable including the talented Ving Rhames, Sarah Polly,

Meki Pfeifer and others whose names escape me. This film largely centers in a shopping mall in which our heroes meet and try to hole up in, much like in the original film. Meanwhile outside the locked doors of the mall, the crowds of zombies are multiplying by the hour and time is running out. This film has gore, but no where near the gore you might think. Fans of the original 70's version may be disappointed, because that one had excessive and at times unnecessary over the top gore. This film was more action-packed, and being a fan of the original, I was surprised to find myself liking it.",1117238400,,1657,4.651877133105802
2066177,5,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead is one of the scariest movies ever made. I thought that no movie could scare me like this. I was sitting in the theater with my legs on top of my seat and trying to cover my ears and eyes. It felt realistic. I think that this movie was well made. The zombies felt so real. I couldn't sleep when I got home. The scariest part for me was when this girl bites the man and pulled most of his skin off. That was really creepy.

The movie started really well. The beginning was going okay, until the next day. Sarah Palley plays a nurse who wakes up the next morning to find out that zombies are killing people. I would be really horrified if that ever happened to me. She tries to escape from her husband who was bitten and turned into a zombie. She found some other survivors who looked for a safe place to stay. They went to stay in a mall, where they had all the supplies they needed. They waited there until they could get rescued. They needed to have a plan in order to escape from the thousands of zombies that were outside the mall.

I think this was a great film that all fans of horror should be able to enjoy very much. The director Zack Snyder really knew how to do this movie more realistically and more develop than the original version in 1978. Even though I didn't see the first version of Dawn of the Dead but for me this version was the best. I liked all the special effects they had and all the zombies looked really real.

Is it just me or are there too many remakes these days? This one is well worth your time. Plenty of blood, gore, guts and gruesome scenes of the flesh-eating zombies looking for new victims. The zombies in this remake aren't as easy to get away from as the ones in past 'Dead' flicks. For one thing,they're able to run. Most memorable scene: where the survivors gas up a truck to escape and the aerial view of like a thousand of those blood munchers surrounding them. It makes the '68 original 'Night Of The Living Dead' look like a joke. In fact, I don't even believe I could sit through that one again.

After I left the theatre from the Dawn of the Dead remake I found myself walking a little more quickly to my car and actually looking over my shoulder a few times.
This movie is definitly on par with the original version, even though the plot lines were distinctly different. Basically the only commonalities were the zombies and the fact that a group of people found a good hiding place at the mall. All the characters were different, the situations were different and, alas, there were no crazed bikers trying to take over.

Now enough about horror history, more about what this movie is like. why it is so cool and i love this movie so much is because the scariness and the zombies. everyone loves zombies they walk around and eat peoples brains out now that u gotta love. okay that was my review on the dawn of the dead dvd unrated directors cut (more blood,more violence and all the zombie fun u need). thanx for reading my review:)",1114732800,,1210,4.170940170940171

2066184,3,B00027SIUK,"Where this is the last place to hid from blood-thirsty zombies.  Dawn of the dead is a remake, just like The grudge, Texas Chainsaw Massacere, ect.  But unlike the Grudge and texas chainsaw massacere, in my mind it's a very good sequal, but despite how hard it tries(And believe me, this movie did put effort into it) It just didn't have the magic the original had(Maybe it's because I seen the 1st and expected to much out of this one).

This movie stars Sarah Polley who is a nurse who has a nightmae, only to find out that(GASP!!!  OH NOO!!)It's not a nightmare.  It's for-jorkin' real, and everthing is about to get real messy. She then runs into a cop(Ving Rhames) with a big shotgun ann in her face like the media to a celeberty.  When they're cool with eachother, they run onto a everyday guy(Jake Weber) and one bad man with a berreta a pregnat woman(Mekhi Phifer).  The only place left for these band of people is the mall.  But security gaurds are there as well, but insted of help them, they wanna give them the finger, that's until they come up with a messed up truce, and believe me, at a time like that, it's messed up like a totaled car.

The one thing I loke about this movie is, no boring introduction, no long tedious explanation, it cuts to the chase like a Cheetah.  You see blood and gore a few minutes in as the movie begins.  The plotline is pretty simple, like it's predissecor, so not much new on the plotline.  You get infected you gotta die.  And the change from slow moving able to walk byable Zonbies to the 28 days later style, try to run without a gun, and you'll get iced kind.  Presents more fear.

This movie also has quite a bit of realisim in it.  Like if you wanna live, sometimes you just gotta say to a friend that's dead, better you than me.  And man it shows how loves not only blind but stupid and demented.(I mean seriously why risk my life for one who's already undead and affected.)  But hey, they say love is pain, and pain hurts, and so doeas love.

One thing I couldn't stand about this movie is that it has some annoying cliche's ,and stupid stuff in it.  Like most of the protagonists being young people(Seen that in horror films for the past........... jeez I can't remember).  Videotaping sex, while Zombies are outside(Either they're enjoying their last moments, or just don't realize they're in danger.  Having that in the movie was pretty much uneeded and stupid)  Forshadowing(I mean, when the main forshadow is first mentioned, I saw it comming, then it comes, and it's just too expected.)  And dull emotional horse-crap.  I'm serious the ending is so old, it makes Al Pacino looks like he can be in a porno flick.  And like I said love hurts, but in this movie, it feels like every other fake Hollywood crap that makes you wanna say O what and I care.

Altho what I couldn't stand, and that crappy ending made my review a 3 stars, everything else before the ending was excellent, but, to me, it's usally the ending that makes a movie.  Why do you think Shawshank Redemption left you with a pleasing end.  Man, I wish more films today would work on endings, but this is definitly a worthy gorefest of a sequal.  I wanna try to get the uncut version, cuz I'm pretty sure it's goryier than what I saw on Starz.

2066186,4,B00027SIUK,"Watched Dawn of the Dead (in its unrated version) last night...

In brief, the movie is about the fall of civilization, and how the survivors cope with it, with the cause of the apocalypse is still clamoring at the door, demanding their lives as well. Of course, the cause of the apocalypse this time is the rise of rather feral zombies, and those who die as the result of being bit by a zombie are doomed to have their bodies become zombies as well. This last piece of knowledge is not spread fast enough to prevent the fall of civilization

The movie opens as a zombie child bursts into the heroine's home, kills her husband, and then the dead husband turns on her. Fleeing her home in her car, she notices, for the first time, that suburbia has descended into chaos, with zombies roaming the streets, seeking unsuspecting human prey. Eventually, the heroine, and a scattered band of other folks she encounters, retreat to the neighbourhood mall, where they hole up, at least for a time. There, the despair of their situation sets in, as contact with the outside world falls away, and they realize that rescue is not coming, and more and more zombies circle the mall.

There is gory violence, a hallmark of movies of this genre. The humour is rather macabre (ref. shooting the Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds zombies out in the parking lot, for fun). There is a hint of desperate sex. Interpersonal conflicts come up all the time: lots of differing opinions as to what to do about their desperate straits, not helped by the fact that they've all had to arm themselves with guns for protections. At the same time, a few of the characters reach out to each other for emotional support, in a rather believable way.

The zombies are a means to an end. This is an apocalypse story, and I have seen similar storylines with triffids, with nuclear war, with biological nasties gone awry. The point of stories like this, when told well, is to illustrate how small groups of people can deal with stressful and severe situations. This movie fits into the ""thoughtful"" end of the horror genre.

The movie is replete with gory violence, and is not for kids. For those who are interested in thoughtful horror movies, then this might be your cup of tea.",1114214400,,2235,4.605527638190955

There's no surprises in this film, at all.  This is another ""horror"" film that isn't scary, isn't original in any way, and doesn't have any particular redeeming value whatsoever. It's shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot, and the story suffers in the same way - there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.  The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable.

I did not see this movie when it came out at the theaters, which is great because it would've been a collosal waste of ten bucks. Against my better judgement I finally watched it recently, only to be disgusted more than I thought possible. Zack Snyder has managed to hit every horror movie cliche without adding a bit of originality to break up the monotony.

This movie is so obviously trying to shock and gross-out (the zombie baby, anyone?), it becomes tiresome before the film is halfway over. Even worse are the attempts to explore the characters' feelings- something the original excelled at and this one fails miserably at. There is no subtlety, only pathetically maudlin scenes that are obviously supposed to be ""sad"". Add in the thoroughly unnecessary sex scene here and there, and you have a perfect example of why the classics shouldn't be remade.

This film borrows the ""fast zombie"" concept from the aforementioned one, but utilizes none of the stark images or philosophical commentary. Aside from zombies in the mall--blah. There was nothing surprising here, when thinking of other movies I've seen.

2066194,5,B00027SIUK,"This definitely goes into my top list of horror favorites! I have yet to view George A. Romero's original tale of zombies taking over the world. I have to say this is though probably one of the best remakes of a horror film I've seen since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003). Plus it's extremely intense. I found myself at the edge of my seat staying tuned to the very end. There are also some fun moments and the music is just grade A+!

I'm sure everyone know's what this movie is about by now, but in case your very unfamiliar here's in short what this freakish tale is all about: It's mainly all about survival when a worldwide plague of zombies start taking over the world. A group takes refuge in a huge shopping mall.

The cast of characters makes you become attached to almost everyone and their little personal stories as they all grow closer together. Sarah Polley who've I loved since her Road to Avonlea day's is perfect for the part of Ana. She plays a very strong female nurse who helps lead the group towards a hopeful survival. Another favorite was Mekhi Phifer playing a strong, but sensitive new family man. And new favorites were Ving Rhames & Jake Weber.

The DVD Extra's: All great!!! This is why you buy the DVD is for all the extra goodies. Not only does this have the unrated director's cut, but it also has Andy's Lost Tape, Special Report (which goes into a little more detail of the worldwide zombie epidemic), Splitting Headache's (behind the scene's of make up, designs, and test models), Attack of the Living Dead, Raising The Dead, Deleted Scene's with Commentary, plus the actual film commentary itself which I have yet to go through.

This is a definite must add to your horror collection! It's full of almost everything! I only hope that George A. Romero thought it lived up to its original classic version. I'm a fan of zombie movies and have grown to love & respect George A. Romero works ever since his original Night Of The Living Dead classic film. I've seen remakes and even loved the stupid related zombie films and sequels, but this does not fall into those categories - it holds its own!

2066195,4,B00027SIUK,"As a fan of the original I approached this remake with extremely low expectations, especially after suffering through the inept Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.  Unfortunately Hollywood execs don't have the cajones to front a big budget Horror movie unless it can guarantee an initial curiosity from moviegoers.  Cue the current remake trend.

The original Dawn is considered by many Horror fans to be a masterpiece(yours truly included); it's an emissary from the Golden Age of Gore.  Amazingly the 2004 version updates the original without coming off as cheap or a cop-out.  It works because it plays the Horror straight.  There isn't a big push to infuse humor(although it's there, don't worry), the Horror is center stage and omnipressent.

First and foremost the focus is the survival situation. I love the scene where Sarah Polley's character just drives by a woman pleading for help. Instinct has kicked in, self preservation is all there is.  As you watch you get the feeling that each character is acting as they should.  That in itself is a rarity in Horror films.

Second is the saving grace for this film and that's the excessive gore.  One of, if not the key elements of the original Dawn was its gore fx (from genius Tom Savini).  This remake really sets a new standard for big budget gore, as in its:

A. realistic enough to make you ask ""How'd they do that?""

B. presented as something new

This movie succeeds on both levels and after watching it you will never look at a truck backing up the same way again.

Dawn of the Dead was not only one of 2004's best surprises it was one of the year's best moviegoing experiences.  Highlighted by an impressive cast including Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, and the exremely underappreciated Jake Weber, Dawn of the Dead provides non-stop action and genuinely frightful moments.

2066200,3,B00027SIUK,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, ""Night of the Living Dead.""  This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.

The original, in addition to being a horror film, was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society.  This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straight-ahead horror approach.  It may seem impossible for someone to actually ""dumb down"" a horror film, but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here.  For this reason, the most famous and imaginative images from the first film - that of the undead wandering through the mall, vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein, just as they did in their previous lives - are nowhere to be found in this edition.  The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing.  Although, theoretically, this should increase their terror potential, it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.

Nevertheless, this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn't rise to the level of the original.  There's a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film, and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre.  There's even a very subtle homage to the great ""Carnival of Souls,"" the far more gentle precursor to all these over-the-top zombie pictures, when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his ""calling"" as ""just a job.""

Although the film isn't really all that scary, ""Dawn of the Dead"" provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado.",1110585600,,2170,4.917808219178082

That was the comforting part in previous zombie movies, at least you could always run. This films throws that right out the window and puts the charactors in a situation where you can't run or hide; you have to find a place to barricade yourself and hope it holds. I agree with some of the other reviewers in that you can't truly call it a remake but maybe a re-working of the original idea.

2066203,5,B00027SIUK,I loved the original. I have always been skeptical of remakes. When Tom Savini did a remake of Night of the Living dead I understood it because George Romero rewrote the script and they had never really made any money on the original because of the whole copyright thing. If you are confused then just ask any horror buff what I am talking about. They can tell you the history of that. Now let's get back to this remake. Actually it is a retelling. Yes it takes place in a mall but there aren't many similarities to the original. It doesn't have a happy ending if you see the unrated version because honestly how can there be with all of the obstacles. That's all I am going to say. there are some people out there who haven't seen this film and I won't ruin it for them. It is a good film and it can't be compaired to the original. When they remade texas chainsaw massacre I was mad because it was so different from the original that I would have preferred them call it a sequel instead. it was a good movie but choose what you are going to call it carefully. that's my point here. this is a good movie but because it doesn't bare much resemblance to the original it shouldn't be called a remake.,1109980800,,1197,4.254385964912281

There are some things about it that make it slightly different from other horror films. The most prominant is that the movie only ends once. You know how most horror films have about 5 endings, and sometimes it just gets really old? This one ends once, and you are left thinking, ""That was a really good way to end this film,"" very satisfying. However, if you keep watching through the ending credits, you see how the story *really* ends. The way the director weaves in the ending of the story is very clever, IMHO.

The soundtrack was really good, as well. The jazz version of Disturbed's ""Down with the Sickness"" is priceless. There are some really humourous moments in the film, as well, if you like dark humour.

2066206,4,B00027SIUK,"basement-dwelling nerds be damned, the 2004 re-invisioning (this one is not a true remake) of this film is filled to the brim with genuine scares, a splash of morbid humor, and an extremely overbearing sense of apocalyptic dread.  i'm not the biggest fan of horror movies, first of all.  the exception to this rule, and also what attracted me to romero's original series as well as this 2004 update, is the extremely ominous sense of helplessness in the face of tremendous, deadly opposition that fills every crack and crevice of this experience.  the opening sequence over which johnny cash's ""the man comes around"" is superimposed is one for the ages; it literally makes me feel uncomfortable to watch it.  that's the big dividing line in this movie: it isn't the gore that makes you squeamish (although there is a boatload of it and more), it's the circumstances it all takes place in.  if the end ever comes, whether it be the work of man or nature, it's going to be broadcast on live TV and it will most likely look very similar to the breathtaking images of complete societal collapse that are seen in the opening of this film.

anyway, another review i read for this film truly nailed it when it stated that ""dawn of the dead"" was the first post-9/11 film to truly play on the new sense of fear and lack of control over one's own life that has been introduced to our generation.  the only movie i have seen that does this better in my opinion is the brilliant m. night shyamalan film ""signs.""  ""dawn of the dead"" probes even darker depths than that film; conversely, the ending in this particular movie is not the happiest one you could imagine.  although the specific idea of an apocalypse where the dead feast on the living and take over the earth is a little more than impossible to put it nicely, the environment of dread created in the movie is not.  the bottom line: it will suck you in.  leaving the theater after this one was like waking up from the worst nightmare i've ever had.

as for the romero purists turning their noses at it, i highly doubt that the deluxe edition box set of the original ""dawn of the dead"" would have been put together as carefully or sold nearly as well had it not been for the renewed interest in old-school horror that this movie has seemingly sparked.  in turn, the endless whining about romero's original version of this film going in and out of print would have continued.  hell, the 2004 redux of ""dawn of the dead"" probably helped romero keep interest and speculation high regarding his forthcoming conclusion to the original 'dead series, ""land of the dead.""  you may think the medicine tastes bad now, but believe it or not, it's helping in the long run.",1108771200,4,2706,4.573498964803313

Now that we got that out of the way let the fun begin. When i saw this i had very little hope this would be a good zombie movie and guess what I was right. First off what made the orignal and only dawn in my book so good was the impending doom through out the whole movie yes the zombies were slow and easy to distroy but there were so many and with there numbers they got you no matter what. But it took time not one day but months. At the start of the orignal scotiy is still functing to a degree and it dwindls through out the entire film from the use of radio and tv brodcasts. in this verision after 10 mins into the film almost every one on the face of the earth is dead which completly takes any impending doom and dreed the movie would of had away and your left with a group of people that you don't care if they live are die because theres no chance for them.

  Now alot of people complane slow zombies suck there boring ect ect  I totaly disagree . Slow moving zombies add so much more intesity as they did in the orignal dawn because unlike this so called remake your much more scared of beening ripped in half and devoured rather then beening trampled to death.

2066218,5,B00027SIUK,"Ha! Okay, I'm probably not the first one to use that review title, but it was such a great moment in the film! Anyway, Dawn of the Dead is a remake of the original George Romero classic zombie flick of the same name. The original film is probably the greatest Zombie film ever made. Second best is probably ""Night of the Living Dead,"" which Dawn was the sequel to. There was also ""Day of the Dead,"" which was the weakest in my opinion, but still good, and a 4th film MAY be coming eventually. This remake, however, is a very different film. Luckily, it's also a very good film.

Dawn of the Dead is the story of (surprise, surprise) a zombie holocaust. A group of survivors holds up in a mall, and eventually, has to escape. These are the similarities between Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and George Romero's original. This time around, however, the zombies RUN, the survivors are larger in number and much more likable and relatable, the story is less social commentary and more action/horror, and one woman is pregnant with a baby that is just... ""breathtaking,"" as a Seinfeld fan might say. All this adds up to a very good movie! Not one to top the original, but definitely loads of fun and highly rewatchable. With each viewing, the closer it gets to the level of the original in my book. It may be my preferences for slow zombies and unexplainable causes that keep the original a notch above for me. The music was perfectly chosen. That jazzy version of ""Down With the Sickness"" is a new fave of mine. The cast is wonderful, and I'm always ready to watch anything with the heart-melting Lindy Booth. Jake Weber is just fantastic as the TV salesman who was born to lead. Ving Rhames kicks azz, as usual, as the tough guy policeman who can't escape his own sense of empathy. The characters of Steve and C.J., the smart-alec yuppie and the mall security guy, are just hilarious. Sarah Polley, who plays a young nurse who just lost her husband to the plague of zombies, may get a bit annoying in some of her more ""bleeding heart"" scenes, but she plays the part well; and Mekhi Phifer is extremely believable as a young father-to-be who doesn't want to accept the loss of his dream and the things that are happening to his family. I could go on about the rest of the cast, but suffice to say they are excellent. I've always been a fan of Matt Frewer's (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Psi-Factor, Max Headroom).

Director Zack Snyder shows masterful skill in a first feature film, and the gore and effects are outstanding.  There are some really great and unforgettable scenes in this film. The opening, with an adorable little girl turned monster, kicks everything off perfectly, letting you know exactly what kind of film you're about to watch. The relationship between Kenneth and Andy was a wonderful touch, though I still wonder why they didn't go down to the toy store and get some remote control airplanes and helicopters to send food to Andy. Well, if you haven't seen the movie, you have no idea what I'm talking about there, sorry. It's good stuff though, trust me. There's this scene towards the end involving a chainsaw that will disturb you intensely AND break your heart a little at the loss of a cutie-pie cast member. I won't give away who; I don't want to spoil it for ya. That was even worse than the baby scene, I think. It was horrible!

This unrated, Widescreen, Director's cut version is awesome! It's not LOADED with extras, but you get plenty, and they're great. There's some behind the scenes zombie stuff, a fun commentary with the director and one of the producers, a great fake news segment chronicling the horrible events, Andy's own home recordings throughout the ordeal, and some fine deleted scenes. Plus, the movie itself has an additional nine minutes of footage not seen in theaters! More character development and more gore! Great flick! Pick it up! Definitely a must for any zombie collection, and, along with ""Sean of the Dead,"" one of the best of the new breed of zombie survival horror!",1108166400,,4022,4.605299860529986
2066219,4,B00027SIUK,"I'm a big fan of the 1978 original Dawn of the Dead.
So when I heard this movie was being remade, I wasn't
that sure how I felt. On one side it's good that the
these type of movies are alive again, but on the other
hand why remake movies that were classics the first time?
So when this movie hit theaters, I tempted to go and see
it....

However, I decided that I'd wait to see the reactions to
it and then buy it on DVD. I finally decided to pick this
movie up at Blockbuster a few nights ago, and watched it
last night. I was surprised that I liked this movie as I
did. The movie from the very start lets you know this
isn't a ""by the book"" remake and really looks to be a
movie of it's own.

It starts off with a nurse getting off work and headed
home to her middle class neighborhood. Everything appears
fine, until her and her husband wake up and that's where
it the action starts off. For the next several minutes
the nurse sees everything that she cares for destroyed
and she manages to come across  including her husband,
friends, and town. She then comes up on Ving Rhames
and rest of the human people. They proceed to go to the
shopping mall that really looks little like the 1978
mall,(Which was in Pittsburg)and  they would hold up
for the next several weeks.

Also at this time more characters enter the fray. Also
in this time we get we treated to several scenes that
only a horror fan could love. This also gives a small
time for some character development which we really
don't get enough of. We also learn that everybody is
pretty average with average smalltown jobs.

The movie really shows that it's different in that
there is really no ""hero"" of all the characters. Even
though Ving is a rather large guy he doesn't really
take the lead role as one would probably expect. But,
we have people that have different ideas about what
to do. They also meet Andy, who is on the rooftop of
the gunstore right across from the shopping mall.

He and Kenneth(Ving Rhames)talk back and fourth via
signs, and they even have alittle game of shooting
down famous looking zombies. After a while they be
come increasingly frustrated by the increasing number
of zombies and they decide that they don't want die
without atleast trying to escape. The next several
weeks they prepare for the escape by fixing up a
bus and loading up on weapons.

As they try and make the escape for really the first
time you can see how the zombies have taken over the
city. The ending is rather predictable. I tried to
spare you of the gory details because this movie
wouldn't be the same if you read about them instead
of seeing the movie as they are HUGE part of what
makes this movie as good as it is.

In the 1978 version the movie is more about isolation
and there is only 4 people and they work as a team and
count on each other. Here, it's more of everybody for
themselves and the emotions are missing in some parts.
The bulk of the emotion and affection comes from Mekhi
Phifer and his love for his pregnant wife. He is really
the only one that appears interesting.

The rest of the cast appears to have too many moments
where they abandon any real emotions. This movie is
good if you just take it as an action-horror type of
movie. If you expect a movie that has the political
and philosophical views of the 1978 version, then you
will be rather dissappointed. However, it should be
understood that despite the title and the setting,
the movie really tries to stand on it's own legs
and really doesn't want to be a remake.

I give this movie 3 1/2 stars, but due to the very
entertaining special features it bumps it up to 4
stars. However, I still prefer the version that has
more character development and better feel of iso-
lation. To me, that is what made the 1978 version
more believeable than this version. You really
could feel that they alone and that painted a more
grim outlook than what you see in this 2004 version.",1108166400,,3920,4.334242837653479

Ana goes to bed with her husband, oblivious to the growing horror and creeping dread right outside. In the morning, Ana faces the new reality first hand. She has no time to adjust or think, only to flee, to react, and to survive. Yes, the dead run the streets, seeking prey, seeking those like Ana to attack and slaughter. Ana's once quiet neighborhood is a battlezone. Her entire life has suddenly plummeted off the cliff of normality into the darkness of unknown terror. Ana runs, screams, and drives on instinct now. She is automatically moving, trying to escape. Trying to keep away from the hordes of former humans that pursue her. The fires burn and the helicopters roar overhead. Ana has entered the end of all things. Somehow, she meets up with other survivors. Kenneth (Ving Rhames) is a cop who comes across Ana's wrecked car. They walk together now, strangers in a nightmare land of roaming cannibals and panic. The two find another small group of warm-blooded people. Can this tiny group stay alive? Can they face what is unthinkable? Do what is inconcievable? DAWN OF THE DEAD is a masterpiece of dread and lurking fear. The situations are fast, violent, and shocking. The characters are living people with pasts that no longer matter. The story is apocalyptic to the extreme, slamming home the idea of a world devoid of all but death, and those who seek to outlast it. Buy this movie immediately!

2066221,4,B00027SIUK,"I went into this thinking it was gonna stink. I love the original Dawn of the Dead, and I thought that having James Gunn (of Scooby Doo fame) writing it was going to ensure its place in the bad remakes of history... Right next to the Psycho remake. I mean, when you have a great piece of material, why remake it?  I feel like Hollywood should only remake movies that stunk in the first place. Don't remake the classics. That was my attitude. But this movie surprised me.

The filmmakers successfully took George Romero's dystopic view of modern society and reinvented it for a new generation. My main question is, did this really need to be a remake? I mean, clearly it shared some things conceptually with Romero's (like the mall, and some of the moments) but this also felt like a pretty complete reboot. I wonder if they could have created this movie as a stand alone zombie flick? Perhaps there is value in the title ""Dawn of the Dead"". Who knows what drives those studio execs?

In the end, this was a successful, fun zombie movie. The characters were a little flat and some of the action was predictable, but the overall effect was good enough for me to give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. Teamed with ""28 Days Later"", I think these two films have brought about a nice zombie rebirth. Unfortunately, that also gives you the B versions like ""Corpses are Forever"" and ""Bloody Bill"", but I still think a resurgence of the zombie genre is a good thing.",1106956800,,1452,4.471698113207547

2066224,4,B00027SIUK,"But the brilliant first-time director, Zach Snyder, was just too good!
The elements that really floored: The completely believable and realistic reactions the characters had to a completely unbelievable situation. Sarah Polley played her shock and grief over the sudden insanity she's awoken to with complete honesty and Vingh Rhames friendship with the lonely Andy is touching. I also really respect the fact that many of the big stunts, like explosions, aren't shown close-up (as in many action films), but from extrememly wide shots, to illustrate the general chaos that's engulfed this Wisconsin suburb.
The dialog is completely natural and the violence is shocking.
This is everything an action/horror film should be!
The reasons I've given Dawn of the Dead four stars rather than five are: 1: What should have been the most powerful part of the story (Taye Diggs' relationship with his pregnant girlfriend) was actually the weakest link. 2: Snyder's removal of the commentary on commercialism that was the whole point of Romero's film.
Weak points aside (including the fact that nobody even suggest amputating newly bitten limbs in an attempt to prevet eventual zombieism), this is a must see film!

One piece of advice, watch the entire closing credits. The film's ending actually takes place durring the credits, so you don't get the whole story if you hit stop!

But to my surprise, this film was competent in just about every area, and best of all it added its own flavour. This time around, the zombies are faster and Snyder removes the absurdist feel of Romero's original, along with all the humorous metaphors regarding capitalism. Snyder is a great director in this film-he makes it compelling, adds his own humorous touches and the cast are all above average. If I had one criticism of the film, it is perhaps of the end credits, where the film goes a little overboard, adding a rather grusome and silly epilogue to the story, told in almost subliminal flashes.",1106438400,,825,4.657534246575342

Yeah it's different, but that's what makes it good.  If I wanted to watch the same movie again, I would've stuck with the original.  I'd rather watch something fresh and new, with only the premise of the original. Dawn of the Dead delivers that. The social commentary of the original doesn't have the same impact today, and the writer wisely moved away from that.  Instead the focus is on the action, characters and creepy factor.  The movie serves up laughs, biting sarcasm and some great zombie killing, which any fan of zombie films would rejoice in.  Yeah the zombies run instead of walk, but that's just a differnt kind of scare from GR's excellent zombie trilogy. The only reason I didn't give this movie a five star rating is because of the DVD extras.  The splitting headaches and attack of the living dead documentaries are great, but the two mini-movies that continue the story from the film are two of the worst DVD extras every featured.  They're horribly written, horribly acted and during both I found myself laughing and cringing, wondering why I was even wasting my time.

2066227,1,B00027SIUK,"For those of you who like short reviews, let me summarize:  ""Dawn of the Dead"" is both amazingly un-scary and incalculably irrelevant at the same time.  It invites neither introspection nor titillation, and is thus utterly unworthy of the media it occupies.

For those of you who would prefer a more extensive explanation of my admittedly strident summary, read on.

Where to begin...well, I'll admit, I was sucked in by ""Dawn of the Dead"".  In spite of uniformly mediocre reviews, I waited for the director's cut, and settled in for what I anticipated would be a stylish horror flick featuring a solid, if not starlit ensemble cast.  And why not?  The trailers indicate tremendous production value, and draw nicely on the inherent inversion of relationships found in any successful zombie film.

Alas, the best parts of the film are featured in said trailers, and the failure to develop upon them is immediately obvious, i.e. the aforementioned inversion (/perversion) of relationships.  For example, in ""28 Days Later"" the first zombie the protagonist encounters is a priest.  His reaction to that character's assault sets (quite absolutely) the theme for a completely changed world.  However, in the case of ""Dawn of the Dead"" this element is utterly wasted, as the characters all too quickly abandon any ties to those they once loved or respected.

This is somewhat forgivable in the case of the zombies.  After all, the hallmark of human evolution has been a remarkable ability to adapt to sudden change.  As a result, the tongue in cheek ""celebrity"" hunting that the survivors engage in is somewhat understandable, and is certainly the highlight of the film.  After all, one must find a way to cope with new surroundings.  However, there is no pathos in this carnage, and in the end, it completely debases the zombie mythos; the horror of being hunted by your next door neighbor, or worse yet, your spouse, must be in some way offset by your past ties to them.

As the body count (zombie count?) rises and the film unravels, things become even more bizarre.  Which is why mentioning the cast seems appropriate; the truth of the matter is, they deliver fine performances.  Even Ving Rhames, who is hardly known for his Shakespearean presence, manages to bring a certain gravitas to his role.  Likewise, Sarah Polley, and the rest of the cast deliver genuinely solid performances that are let down by an utterly ridiculous script.  If you want to experience a genuine reaction to an apocalyptic event, read ""Alas, Babylon"", ""The Stand"", ""I am Legend"" or even the awful, but practical ""Some Will Not Die"".  However, avoid this film in which hillbillies straight out of ""Deliverance"" somehow not only manage to get a job as security guards in Wisconsin, but get the mall owners to allow them to wear sidearms.

But wait, one must suffer through the insultingly ridiculous performance of the otherwise laudable Mekhi Phifer.  After establishing himself as a force on ""er"" and ""8 Mile"" why he didn't run screaming from this script is a complete mystery.  The producers must have driven a dumptruck full of money up to his house, because nothing else could justify the total waste of his considerable talents.

Last, but certainly not least, there is the awful and completely misguided ending to the film.  If there were any justice in the world, all producers, directors and actors in post-apocalyptic and dystopian films would be forced to read ""A Clockwork Orange"", but unfortunately, that is far from the case.  The director of ""Dawn of the Dead"", in his lazy credits, completely misses the point of the twenty-first chapter of said book, namely, that there is good in all of us, and that if we are utterly self-destructive as a species, we are capable of redemption as individuals.  If he had allowed his characters to become utterly craven in the face of American consumerism, this might have been acceptable, but even as he tries to redeem them, they are damned to irrelevance by the total lack of appreciation for spiritual growth.

Visually disgusting, emotionally neither scary nor inspiring, and viscerally dull, ""Dawn of the Dead"" strikes out swinging.  In spite of the best efforts of a completely wasted cast, this is a film that should be avoided (queue the irony) like a plague.  As an alternative, I would strongly recommend, ""28 Days Later"" which offers genuine thrills, original cinematography, and a well thought out, multi-layered story.

2066228,4,B00027SIUK,"This movie will get your attention.  More gotchas than you could ask for and a truly believable armageddon settings and theme.  Having watched the original Dawn of the Dead I thought I knew what to expect in this movie.  However, other than the fact that there are zombies and the character are hiding out in a shopping mall, there are no other similarities to the original.  Another major difference is that the zombies aren't slow lumbering corpses, they are fast, very fast (IE 28 Days Later).

Naturally just like any zombie movie and especially any George Romero themed one this movie has an adundance of gore.  Those with squemish constitutions need not apply.  The special effects in the movie are solid, the plot is fairly straightforward and all of the characters are well rounded.  Of course just as with any horror movie and especially any zombie movie the characters have their moments where you wonder what the hell they were thinking, but this doesn't happen often enough that it annoys the viewer.

Just as with any George Romero type movie the focus isn't neccessarily the zombies and killing, it is the character development.  Unlike the Romero classics this movie does up the action a bit more and cut back a little bit on the character focus.  Some might argue that this is a travesty, but I think that the new balance was very well managed and fitting for today's audiences.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the originals for the excessive amount of time spent on getting to know the characters, but this movie proves that there can be some successful middle ground.  Don't be mistaken though, this movie wouldn't be as good as it is if they hadn't taken at least some time to focus on the characters.

In conclusion, this is a great zombie movie which took some intelligent notes from the formula of 28 Days Later and the George Romero classics.  There is good character development. Plenty of shocking imagery and character interaction to please just about any crowd.  The critics love it, the fans love it and you'll love it.

2066230,5,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead is generally seen as one of the all-time classic horror movies - particularly in the Zombie sub-genre. George A. Romero made a killing for himself with his ""Dead"" trilogy (Night, Dawn and Day) and this is the 2004 remake of the second part of that gory trifecta. Fortunately, whilst the film has the same basic premise, it manages to add a whole series of plot twists which are not in the original. This should delight old and new fans alike - why just make a carbon copy of the original?

Okay - so what's the basic premise? Well, an unknown disease is ravaging the planet. Once they have suffered a bite from an infected human, the victims rapidly waste away before dying a sudden death. Even more sudden is the re-animation of the corpses. Within 1-5 minutes after checking out, the corpses check back in with a maniacal blood lust that can only be sated by feasting on warm human flesh. The opening scenes of this movie are superb. The introduction of the zombies will have you on the edge of your seat, as they take place in an all-too-familiar everyday environment, giving an air of credibility to an incredible story. This is very much in the mould of the excellent 28 Days Later... and really sets the scene perfectly for the bedlam that follows. The only horror film I have seen recently which delivers such an impactful opening is the darkly delicious Final Destination 2. As the USA descends into hysteria and madness, with family members devouring each other willy-nilly, small groups of people huddle together and feverishly try to find refuge from the growing hordes of psychopathic zombies.

Unlike your run-of-the-mill zombie of yore, these mothers don't shuffle aimlessly towards you - they run like the clappers and head directly for your jugular! A dwindling group of ever-more desperate fugitives from the zombie masses include a cop (Ving Rhames), a nurse who has just witnessed her neighbour's daughter rip her husband's throat out (Sarah Polley) and a man who is caring for his heavily pregnant wife (Mekhi Phifer). Gaining entry to a local mall, they are incarcerated by a bunch of paranoid, and power-crazed, security guards. Whilst initially they fully expect to be rescued by the armed forces, as the days pass by there is a growing realisation that there will be no saving ""charge from the cavalry"" and they will have to work together to fight their own way out of the mall. From the roof they spot a lone man, Andy (Bruce Bohne) on an opposing rooftop - fortunately directly above a gun shop. Communicating with binoculars and whiteboards, they strike up a friendship and determine to pool their food with Andy's guns and break out of their self-imposed prison...

The pacing of the film slows a little during the middle third, becoming a little less tense and verging on the repetitive. This is only a relative observation however, because the opening minutes and the final reel are top-notch. The acting is credible throughout and even the dialogue has a refreshing touch of reality most of the time. There are a couple of weak plot points (a budding romance just does not make any sense given the recent history of the characters) and some of the scares are telegraphed too far in advance. The use of exploding gas bottles is a little - forgive the pun - overblown at times too (be careful - your barbie could take out a city block)! The editing too, can be a little frenetic at times, but this is a relatively minor peeve and can be forgiven when you consider the overall vibe of the picture. The casting is quite appropriate, with all of the main characters filling their roles rather well, and some interesting cameos to watch out for with the likes of Matt Frewer (Max Headroom anyone?) and horror royalty Tom Savini (Day of the Dead).

Dawn of the Dead is a winner. It is by no means perfect - I thought there could have been more black humour in the mix - but it will not disappoint fans of the flesh-eating zombie genre. The film does contain a few jump-out-of-your-seat frights, but the flesh-eating is surprisingly a little under-done. That is not to say the film lacks gore - amputations and eviscerations do figure, but by and large your run-of-the-mill exploding head shot is the main course. This film has much more of an action component than the original, which was a straight up horror flick. In the true spirit of cheap horror flicks though, the obligatory gratuitous breast shots do still make an appearance. The make up special effects are superbly done and there appears to be a satisfying lack of (all too often painfully obvious) CGI on offer (bar the obligatory fireballs, and a couple of helicopter shots). In the main, this is a no-nonsense zombie-smashin', shotgun-blastin', action-horror fest. Perhaps not quite as chilling as the 1978 original, Dawn of the Dead: Director's Cut (2004) will delight fans nevertheless. Highly recommended for zombie aficionados everywhere. Oh - and by the way - it is essential that you watch until the ending of the closing credits as there is important plot information interspersed among them.",1104537600,8,5104,4.776896942242356

When I first saw Romero's as a 15-year-old junior high school kid, coming out of the theater into the street crowds, I honestly feared that the people around me would all turn around and come upon me. But this remake evokes no such fear. Those undeads are so agile and fast-moving that they all seem more alive than the living.

Lacking the kind of eerie atmosphere that the original version exudes, the film is much less disturbing and no different from any other monster panic film, say, Jaws, Alien, Blade II, you name it. In other words, this doesn't have to be a zombie film at all.",1103673600,3,686,4.3515625
2066236,5,B00027SIUK,"Well first off let me say that I am a veteran of zombie films and horror films at that, and I found Dawn of the Dead (the Unrated Version) to be outstanding. I have seen the film twice, and have come to really enjoy this movie. I won't go into any long description for you, but I will speak to the zombie fans only. This is a MUST see for you zombie fans, I found the movie heart stopping and very powerful. You will also enjoy the fact (if you have the dvd anyway,) the amount of details in this darn film. If you stop the dvd and study little aspects of the movie you will be very suprised at the small details put into this film. I take my hat off to the director for his nod to the original Dawn, but also how he gives some references to Resident Evil and 28 Days Later, whether he saw those films or not I cannot say but I sense that in this movie.

Now here is where I found weak spots, there was too much character development for people that ultimately did not matter, and the one character (who at the end of the movie you really feel sorry for,) he gets the boot by the director as far as critical importance. I do enjoy the fact that the movie had a ""team"" element to it, rather than primary and seconday characters. The overusage of swearing was very out of place, in some scenes. I also felt that time was wasted with the security guards and with staying inside the mall. There was not enough internal dialogue concerning why the group should risk leaving.

In the end I really enjoyed this film and I wanted more at the end of this movie, even after seeing it a second time. It has amazing staying power compared to the first film where there is entirely too much drawn out character play. The original 1978 Dawn was wonderful from a script point of view but most of the effects and final confrontation were generally weak. This 2004 version has patches of weak moments but it keeps you going, the blood keeps pumping, where as the original is just a few heartbeats. So I think you zombie fans are going to have quite a bit to chew on in this movie, btw listen to the slurp noises when that guy lights the dynamite!!",1103587200,,2130,4.205378973105135
2066237,5,B00027SIUK,"Remakes of classic horror flicks are largely failures.  Zack Synder, however, has reinvented ""Dawn of the Dead"" for the modern audience--and it comes out a sure-fire winner!

Something awful is happening the world over: the dead aren't staying dead.  Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse, wakes up to find a small girl on a murderous rampage; escaping out of the city, Ana meets Kenneth (Ving Rhames, delightfully stoic throughout most of his role), a cop who's searching for his brother.  They meet up with a rag-tag bunch of survivors (led by the enigmatic Michael, played with charm and finess by Jake Weber).  Taking refuge in a nearby mall, they watch their numbers grow...but as more survivors appear, so do more zombies.  And it's only a matter of time before they break in, and the living become the living dead...

This movie is suspenseful and horrific.  Not as gory as it's been toted to be, but that's ok; the atmosphere is what really counts in a horror movie anways, and the atmosphere here reeks of pure terror.  Surprisingly, the characters are three-dimensional; the acting is superb, by both the living and the ""dead.""  The special effects are memorable, and the pacing is fast and frantic.  Yet, there's enough dark humor thrown in to give you some genuine chuckles here and there.

Let's not call this film a ""remake,"" after all.  Sure, it borrows the storyline...but it is good enough to stand on its own as a seperate horror film.  I don't know if it, too, will become a classic...but it should.  It's that good.  It's that scary.",1103500800,3,1543,4.766037735849056
2066238,4,B00027SIUK,"I honestly have to say I am not a horror film fan.  I have never been fascinated (or even very scared) of most horror films with the exception of the very best ones like The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Masacre or The Omen.  Mainly because most horror flicks are just slasher flicks, and if they attempt to be anything more, they are just kidding themselves.

With that said, I must say I was very impressed with Zach Snyder's remake of Dawn of the Dead.  He obviously appreciated the original and did a remarkable job of staying faithful to the horror aspect.  The satirical aspects of Romero's version where people indulge themselves in a materialistic setting has been totally abandoned but certainly not missed.  This one goes more for action, suspense, horror and apparently in this unrated version, more character development.  I never saw the version in the theater so I cannot make the comparison, but I do believe the characters do get fleshed out (no pun intended) quite a bit, especially with Mekhi Phifer's character and his struggle on what to do with his pregnant wife, who may or may not be infected.

The best part of this film is that it is an entertaining and well-written story before it is a horror flick.  But fear not (or fear a lot), the horror aspects are extremely creepy, especially in an early scene with Sarah Polley battling off the little girl from the neighborhood.  And as the movie goes on, the amount of gore does not try to make up for a lack of fright.  This is a great movie that happens to be a horror flick with a not so happy ending, especially if you keep watching through the credits.  The DVD extras are great, providing a lot of insight on how the effects were done and some low budget extra mini-movie/documentaries.  But strangely no theatrical trailer is included.",1103500800,,1811,4.639498432601881
2066239,4,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead remake/2004 what ever you like to call may not be as good as it's original but c'mon they are totaly different films well except for the fact that both films have zombies(duh).  I really enjoyed this film in the Theater even though I kina hated it but I decided to rent the Unrated Directors cut and now I have a totaly different opinion on this awesome film.  This film in it's own way is a pretty good Zombie flick.  Now as for Plot I won't go into that since you can just watch the film for yourself.

The Director Zack Snyder(sorry If I spelled his name wrong)did a great job with the make up effects of the zombie making them look real and spoooooky..eheh.  The Zombies in this film are some of the best looking zombies in any film, and this time they run making it difficult for the characters to survive.  Now getting to the characters now sorry if this is a bit harsh but I found the characters(except for Ving Rahmes)to be really stupid especially that girl who(obviously) got that gunshop owner killed with that dog.  The characters showed stupidity especially Phifers character with the whole Zombie baby scenario.  That's the only real reason this film ticked me off was because of the stupid Characters.

As of that the film has a great setting and everything even though the zombies are hardly seen in the mall(unlike the Original DOTD) and maybe it's just me but there is lack of zombies in this film.  Sure there are a few scenes of them but overall it's pretty much dialoug then running away from zombies ect.  And another thing that botherd me was the fact that in the menue screen of the DVD the zombies scared the crap out of me unlike the zombies in the film that don't seem as scary as the ones seen in the menue(and yes I know those are seens in the movie, I'm just saying).

Also the ending was just lame.  The Director could have used a better ending.  Though I have read forums saying if you pause or do slow-mo near the end credits, you can see Ving Rames running in the woods while the other characters(hopefully.eheh)are Zombie food.

One thing that really makes this film shine is the Johny Cash Intro as we see him sing about the apocolypes and we're shown scenes of mass chaous and so on.

Overall I really enjoyed the Dawn of the Dead Remake Unrated Directors cut, though I was a bit mad that they didn't have the trailers, since I love the trailer in this film.  Also if you're wondering if there is more gore in this version of the film there is but not that much.

Over all I really liked Dawn of the Dead 2004 and eventhough the title is misleading it still is a very awesome film and that is why I am giving this film a..

4.5 out of 5 stars.

By the way if you felt bad for The Gun Shop owner you'll feel worse about him when you see the LOST TAPE though I must say his acting sucked but then again what I know about good acting.

No, i'm one of those ""this is a horror movie, so let me kick back and enjoy it"" types. I find horror movies fun to watch and a great escape from the real world.

With that said, I really enjoyed this movie. I don't see how anyone didn't. I think the one key aspect that made a lot of people dislike this movie was b/c it was called ""Dawn of the Dead"". They were expecting a remake that followed that original to a T. That would have been soooo boring.

The only things that link the two movies together are: there are zombies and there are people stuck in a mall. That's it and that's all there needs to be. If they named this movie something else, then people would have complained that this movie was too much like ""Dawn"". You can't win for losing.

Dawn of the Dead 2004 stands on its own as a gutsy all-out splatter flick. Special fx on their own don't impress me, but coupled with interesting characters, witty dialouge, and killer camera work, then they chuff me!

2066242,4,B00027SIUK,"Really, if you look at it independently from George Romero's masterpiece, it IS pretty good.  No, not great.  But pretty good.  And truthfully, the bulk of my complaints about it do result from comparing it to the original film.

  First off, the opening sequence (10 minutes or so), are AWESOME -- possibly the most intense set I've seen in a long time.  Very kinetic and spooky.  The opening credits are great, capturing the paranoia perfectly, and using Johnny Cash's (RIP) ""The Man Comes Around"" was nothing short of unexpected genius.  Unfortunately, the rest of the film is sorta downhill from there.

  Again, the bulk of my complaints in comparison to the original.  Other than in the opening scenes, the zombies didn't spook me very much.  In the original, when the zombies got ahold of somebody, there was no question of the fact that some serious flesh consumption was going to occur.  Here, it seems like the character can get away with maybe just getting nibbled on a little so he can turn into a zombie a la ""28 Days Later.""  Not bad, but not too satisfying to a fan of the franchise.  I also wasn't a fan of EVERY character having a witty one-liner to go out on.  That got a little old.  And I DO wish they'd kept the paranoia of the opening (newsreel stuff, etc) going.  Some of the best stuff from the original trilogy was Romero's use of TV/radio media to demonstrate how the world order was collapsing and the characters were truly on their own.

  Other than that, though, this turned out to be a nifty little movie, with a fairly decent cast.  Easily worth a rental if you enjoy the zombie genre or thought ""28 Days Later"" was great.  Again, if you're a fan of Romero's originals you will be let down.

  Night of the Living Dead (1968) was a low-budget film but since has become a huge success.  In 1968, it was a terrifying film and set the standards for future horror films.  Everyone should see the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) in its original black & white version or the televised computer-colorized version.

  Five more stories were made by Director George A. Romero:
 DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978).
 DAY OF THE DEAD (1985).
 Night of the Living Dead (1990) (Remake).
 Dawn of the Dead (2004) (Remake).
 LAND OF THE DEAD (2005).
 DIARY OF THE DEAD (2007).
 Day of the Dead (2008) (Remake).
 SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD (2010).

  George A. Romero decided to remake his film, a new version of ""Night of the Living Dead"", in color with a new cast, released in 1990, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990).
  Now in 2004, without any help from George Romero, but just a credit for writing of the original film, Director, Zack Snyder made a remake of George A. Romero's second...Living Dead film, ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978), a sequel to his first film ""NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD"" (1968).
 For this 2004 version of DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004), they had to build malls sets inside the actual mall, the Thornhill Square Mall in Ontario, Canada (now demolished), because they could not get the approval from the real stores.
  I won't spoil the story for you, but everyone likes the idea of zombies in a shopping mall.  This time the special effects are really bloody grotesque.
  Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger and Tom Savini, who where in the original 1978 version, make an appearance.
  In the cast: Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber ( Weber is currently on the ABC Network, LOST tv series), Mekhi Phifer, Michael Kelly and Jayne Eastwood.

Well it's true and not so true. I like both movies. They both have very good parts. I still prefer the slow moving zombies of the original and older films, but the new Dawn of the Dead has a charm all it's own.

The first ten minutes is amazing. As our heroine flees for her life as her husband is turned into a flesh eating maniac in their own bedroom. The little girl was just disturbing in her initial attack on him. As she races out of the bathroom and gets in the car, panic has already taken to the streets. Car accidents, zombies eating their victims on a bus, it's just a total nightmare.

Then the plot foolows the original as our desperate heros barracde themselves in the mall. Here they find three security guards who at first are none too welcoming. After everyone gets along the usual fun begins. There's target practice in the parking lot (""Burt Reynolds! Get Burt Reynolds!"")

A truckload of human refugees arrive and we get more characters to interact with. Before they escape the mall though, The zombie birth and zombie baby is a great scene.

In the basement of the mall we get a little McGyver and two trucks are made into Mad Max type vehicles. The plan is to get to a boat and sail off to somewhere.

The ending during the title credits gives the film more of an ending than the original did. The original was just a cliffhanger, but we see here in the remake that their survivng the mall was for nought.

I usually don't get scared very often, nowadays, but this movie, the idea and the fact that it is set in today's modern times, leaves you with a feeling of uneasiness and dread.

I had a little trouble sleeping the first few nights after watching this remake,so that usually means it is a good movie to watch and definitely contributes something special to the Horror genre.

2066250,4,B00027SIUK,"As a hardened veteran of the horror film (old enough to remember seeing the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" on the big screen) I have to say this is a adequate remake of ""Dawn,"" although it lacks George Romero's satiric commentary on the materialism of American society during the 1970's and Tom Savini's makeup work. (Nothing in this version remotely approaches the numbing shock of the zombie husband attacking his wife in the stairwell scene from the original ""Dawn."") Also, the satirical elements of the original ""Dawn"" would be lost on modern audiences, although the shopping mall has indeed become a fixture in our modern lives. The theme of this film, reflecting the zeitgeist of modern American life, is simply survival. Perhaps the zombies are really Republicans infected by a germ which allows them to reveal their true cannabalistic natures. The character of the self-absorbed Steve certainly fits this mold. (Ann Coulter would feel right at home with the zombie hordes, I am sure.)

My major problem with this remake is the poor transfer of film to DVD. Virtually the entire film is embalmed (pun intended) in a overwhelming hue of green, visible in even well-lite scenes where porcelain whites appear green. Considering the time it took  between theatrical release and DVD release, and all the added goodies that were added on (the best being Andy's last days and the ""newscasts"" of the undead epidemic), you would think the producers would have taken the time to more closely examine the overall quality of the digital transfer itself. However, if the over-saturation of green hues doesn't bother you (and the less sophisticated viewer may not notice this odd lighting effect at all), you should find this remake worth your while. However, a remastering of this version should be considered someday. Perhaps at the same time when the producers consider making a ""Twilight of the Dead""?

The movie is very realistic, it combines modern reality and the undead, the movie is very well acted and has stunning gore effects and the zombies are more realistic than those i have seen in other zombie movies. Starts of in a quite ordinary town when a lady wakes up in the middle of the night and in front of the bed is her daughter with blood all over her mouth, the father jumps out of bed and rushes over to check her( you can only guess what happens next). She escapes and ends up meeting three companions who together find a secure shopping mall which keeps them separate from the undead. After some time they are joined by a group of other folk and start to develop realistic human relationships with each other, having fun, mucking around, helping each other. The movie gives you the feel of doom.

The movie is very graphical all deaths and gore is shown including one where a womon is sheared in half by a chainsaw, so it is probably recommended than no children what-so-ever watch this.

Deffinately one of the better remakes that i have seen gets a deffinate 5 stars from me i recommend that you see it.",1101772800,,1327,4.475206611570248
2066252,2,B00027SIUK,"In fact, it looked more like a remake of 28 days than it did Dawn of the Dead. There is nothing very scary in this movie at all. Van Helsing was a better movie. Rent this movie before you go out to buy it because once youve seen it you won't care to see it again. Better yet, rent or buy 1985's Day of the Dead, probably the best zombie movie to date.",1101772800,3,351,3.8219178082191783
2066253,3,B00027SIUK,"Actually, I rate this film as 3 and a half stars. Also please understand, as one reads my following review that I am generally not a fan of gory films.

Now released on a finely packaged DVD, this film ""ain't"" your daddy's zombie movie. Gone are the somnambulant and passive cannibals of old, content to merely stagger in white-faced blackened eyed conformity in search of mass consumerism. Screaming into their place are now the lightening fast, rabid, bloody-eyed ravagers of DAWN OF THE DEAD, utterly devoted to devouring any and all fools who desire to stand defiant. These are un-dead capitalists with attitudes eager to exploit any weakness.

This remake of the 1978 cult classic largely eschews the original's blatant social satire in favor of legitimate chills, thrills and gross-out, not to mentioned a multitude of smart film references appropriate for an audience weaned on DVD's, MTV, video games and Reality Television. It also brilliantly utilizes Johnny Cash's apocalyptic ""When The Man Comes Around"" for a blood soaked opening title sequence that establishes a mood of alienated unease.

Like the original, DEAD concerns the survival efforts of a band of humans barricaded in a shopping mall (complete with delightfully narcotic Muzak!) against a gruesome horde. Fortunately, this version boasts a higher budget, raucous alternative rock music score, stronger actors and smart visual allusions to everything from Poe's ""The Masque of The Red Death"" to ALIEN, THE ROAD WARRIOR as well as the original film.

DAWN OF THE DEAD rightly knows it isn't high art. Its number one objective is to scare the dickens out of the audience and provide some great action sequences and a few obsidian-hued barbs at contemporary consumerist culture. Not afraid to embrace a disturbing and down-beat ending, it wisely knows its limitations and, as a result, achieves its goal.

The DVD is filled with a truck load of interesting extras. ""Andy's Home Movies"" and ""The News Reports"" are both smartly written and entertaining. The ""behind the scenes"" featurettes is perfunctory yet fun. It is obvious the filmmakers and actors had a great time creating this blood drenched roller coaster.",1101686400,,2183,5.172804532577904
2066254,4,B00027SIUK,"Ok I won't say this is the best movie I have ever seen, however I will say it is one of the scariest I HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON!!!!!  I love scary, but this one was a little bit much, even for me.  It left me afraid to turn out the lights at bedtime, even though my husband is laying right beside me.  It filled my head with worries that this could actually happen or worse still...might possibly happen, and of course it has given me a nightmare or two.  I think this all relates to how it all really messed with my ""sense of normalness"".  It made me think about the end of the world and the end of humanity.  At the same time it also made me think about how it would feel to be trapped in a mall with a few complete strangers, and know that being there, in that situation would be as good as it was EVER going to get.  Not a pleasant thought, is it?

Dawn of the Dead has so many haunting visions and no matter how I try, I just can't cleanse them from my brain, even though I wish I could.  I am tired of being scared, looking for zombies to come crashing through my windows at home, or roaming the streets when I am trying to drive to work or relax at home and watch a movie.  Augh!  Scary stuff.  I thought The Ring was scary, but this one is way more frightening, and I have to say that means it's pretty darned scary!

I won't be buying this one, but it was good for what it was...gory and SCARY and made the similar movie ""28 Days Later"" look like a birthday party for 5-year-olds.  Didn't like the ending though as it didn't tie things up in my opinion.  Get this one if you like to be scared to the point that you pee your pants.  Don't say I didn't warn you!  Oh, and watch out for zombies...those things bite HARD!",1101686400,,1724,4.008797653958944
2066255,4,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead (2004) is a remake of the George Romero 1978 classic. Director Zack Snyder utilizes the technology of today to enhance the movies realistic feel. Dawn achieves this realistic quality. In the past few years there have been a string of so called Zombie movies to hit the big screen. Resident Evil, 28 Days Later and Cabin Fever feature the undead.  Zombie movies are popular today because of the video games that feature them. The players can kill the Zombies just like the movies.

  Dawn of the Dead (2004) Unrated Director's cut is gory and realistic. Every detail is carefully explored to give a realistic feel if the undead were to conquer the planet today. This movie is scary in the fact of, if this scenario came true, but not scary in deliberately trying to pop zombies out of hidden camera angles that will make you jump out of your seat. (Okay some pop outs!) This movie is more of in your face reality. The pregnancy and baby born scene do nothing to help the movie move along and it should have been just left out.

  If you want to see realistic images of killing Zombies and gory blood sucking scenes, then this movie is for you. The unrated DVD should not be seen by children under seventeen; hence the rating. The plot and ended do nothing for this movie but take a back seat to the realistic action/bloody scenes.

  I have one question for the Zack Snyder; why Milwaukee? What did we ever do to desire such a horrific setting!

  The majority of the bonus features can be skipped. The only ones worth watching are the behind the scenes filming of the makeup/special effects and the deleted scenes with commentary by Zack.
  Add this to your DVD collection if you are a realistic Zombie.",1101600000,,1720,4.538961038961039

when i finnally saw the movie i was impressed.the running zombies worked quite well,better then i thought.though ironicly it suffers from the same things the original suffers from.when they just chill in the mall it gets boring.the scene with the zombie baby was sad and creepy,but it was a great scene though.also the scene where the lead female charecter was trying to exscape the neighborhood in her car was verry well done.showing buildings on fire in the horizone of the city giving the crisis a larger scope of destruction.the dvd extras are great also including the lost tape of andy.by the way the lil girl in the begining is not the couples daughter.how did she get into the house is a mystery to me though",1101600000,,1001,4.819767441860465

The beginning was ok, with the young girl biting a shunk out of her fathers neck. The rest is only shooting some of those zombies in the head. I was waiting for gruelling bites, ripping off flesh, pure gore, but nothing came. They keep shooting them in the head, nothing more and I was getting pretty bored. Even the actors were looking bored instead of afraid. There were never any moments of true fear, no excitement. Good for once, but I think I'll just keep watching the Romero version or Resident Evil again.",1101254400,2,616,4.660550458715596
2066260,4,B00027SIUK,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is, of course, a remake of a sequel - not exactly promising origins for a movie.  However, it's a surprisingly good modern horror flick.  Sarah Polley (The Sweet Hereafter, Go) stars as a young Wisconsin nurse who awakes one morning to an unexplained zombie invasion.  As she flees, she meets other survivors, including Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer.  They hole up in a mall, hoping to escape the fast-moving zombies.

First time director Zack Snyder has crafted a first-rate thriller, and the movie really shines in the Director's Cut.  Despite the overabundance of zombie flicks in recent years, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is surprisingly fresh.  The excellent cast helps make the situations credible; it's a little jarring at first seeing indie queen Sarah Polley in a horror movie, but she more than holds her own.  The action starts right away and never lets up, and the movie includes healthy doses of humor - listen to the muzak playing in the mall as a good example of the twisted humor.  Finally, the makeup and the overall conception of the zombies are outstanding.  The movie clicks on all fronts, managing to be scary and engrossing.  Make sure you watch through the credits - the action doesn't stop!  Highly recommended.

DVD Extras: The DVD is loaded with behind-the-scenes documentaries, deleted scenes, and a director's commentary.  Particularly enjoyable are the docs that show how they designed the zombies.",1101168000,20,1449,4.983333333333333
2066261,4,B00027SIUK,"I saw this movie last night and I enjoyed every min of it, pretty cheesy not knowing what started the disease but alot of blood and alot of action and violence, I don't know if its better than the original, but all I know that this is one hell of a movie. 4.4/5",1101168000,,261,3.943396226415094
2066262,4,B00027SIUK,"""Dawn of the Dead,"" as everyone knows, is a remake of a ""classic"" George Romero movie -- unseen by me.  Perhaps because I didn't have to carry the obligatory baggage of the cult classic with me while I watched this movie, I really enjoyed this ""Dawn of the Dead"" as a chilling, scary flick that stayed with me well after the final credits roll.

The story of ""Dead"" is about as simple as it gets.  For an unknown reason (while the DVD jacket refers to a ""virus,"" the movie never explains it), corpses are re-animating as zombies . . . with appetites.  How this all gets started is unclear, since it appears that one becomes a zombie by being bitten by a zombie, raising an interesting ""chicken or the egg"" logical problem.  But you don't watch movies like ""Dead"" to think deep thoughts -- you watch them to get the bejeezus scared out of you.

And ""Dead"" delivers the goods!  The opening scene is a masterpiece of building tension.  Our heroine, Sarah Polley, a nurse, finishes a long shift at the hospital and obliviously misses several hints that something is going very, very wrong (including changing the radio station just as a critical ""news flash"" hits the airwaves).  She heads home, chats with a cute neighborhood tyke, and has a romantic night with her husband.  She wakes to find the tyke chewing on her husband's carotid artery, and soon she's fighitng off her husband, now a zombie.

She escapes her husband, who gives up chasing her car to eat a neighbor who walked outside in her bathrobe, unaware that the world is coming to an end.

Soon, she is in the mall with a gang of survivors, each with separate subplots and varying degrees of likeability.  The mall becomes the survivors' refuge against the rampaging hordes of zombies.  The movie skillfully balances the need for the survivors to occasionally run into zombies for the action scenes with the survivors' intelligence -- we don't have too many instances where we scream ""What are you thinking?"" to the characters as they wander off by themselves to their doom as in so many other horror movies.  The survivors' generally intelligent behavior highlights the scare-factor -- one is hard-pressed to find instances where we'd react much better than the survivors under the same circumstances.

In an effort to avoid spoilers, let's just say that the gore-factor is high, but not overly so (well, once you're somewhat used to the fact that we're dealing with flesh-eating zombies).  There is a subplot involving a pregnant woman that is downright disturbing, but is well-acted and comes across as both terrifying and heart-breaking without being exploitative.  But director Zack Snyder is able to generate tension and scares by implication as well as by direct action, which is always good in a horror movie -- the terror that you imagine is usually scarier than what you actually see.

All in all, an excellent horror movie.  Make sure you watch through the credits to see the ""real ending!""",1101168000,,2961,4.791338582677166
2066263,2,B00027SIUK,"I was skeptical from the start. Remakes usually suck with very few exceptions, but then I kept reading about how great this film was. Even die-hard Romero fans said it was worth watching. I got excited and I went out and bought the dvd. Stupid me, I should have rented it first. The whole time I was watching this I was saying to myself, ""You know, I'd rather be watching a REAL Zombie movie.""

Sure the makeup FX are great, and the ""fast zombie"" thing didn't really bother me, but let's face it; not only was the character development weak and stereotypical, the story completely lame and unconvincing and the acting nothing to write home about, but the gore was astonishingly weak! The Zombies are supposed to eat people right? Why did we not see one zombie eating someone? Even back in 1968, Romero didn't shy away from showing the zombies actually eating the flesh of their victims. This was no where to be seen in this film. No guts (except a VERY brief shot), no flesh eating... nothing. And yes, I'm talking about the ""unrated"" version. And the feeling of apocalyptic terror in Romero's films that really made you believe that the world was coming to an end was missing from this film. The whole thing came across like a mainstream film trying to be hardcore yet falling short. Sort of like when MC Hammer tried to do a Gangsta Rap record way back. Like I said, the makeup was great, and there were some good suspenseful moments here and there... but why should I waste my time with a lightweight disappointment like this when I could watch Romero or Fulci's truly horrific films.

Oh and the obligatory Nu-Metal song during the credits didn't help things. Well, the big corporate studios know their audience.",1101081600,6,1716,4.622950819672131
2066264,5,B00027SIUK,"How dare someone attempt to remake such a classic as George Romero's Dawn of the Dead? The original was one of the pinnacles of horror classics. I assumed this remake  was going to be a tragic mistake like Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho. That thinking changed about 10 minutes into this new version. WOW! These new zombies are faster and hungrier. This new version pays respectful homage to the classic while updating the original with a faster pace, interesting characters, and more graphic gore. If you are a horror fan (or a fan of the original), BUY IT. You won't be disappointed.

Interesting trivia for flesh eating Zombie movie fans: While you watch the movie, notice one of the stores inside the mall is named ""Gaylen Ross"". Is there anything significant about this?",1100822400,2,775,4.776119402985074
2066265,4,B00027SIUK,"Yes, I mean It, this is a great remake!!!

First, I'm a big fan of Romero trilogy (3 best zombies movies ever) and Dawn was always my favorite.

Enough, let'S talk about the remake. First, a very good storyline, similar to the original but with some differents twists. Very good acting, and I mean it, this was my biggest surprise, everyone is good but Polley was amazing. Backing up with great caracters development the script is just great. A lot of action, frenetic action because this time some zombies are very fast. I really like the action sequences of the movie, but the gore, yes, the gore is very good. Great gore sequences like in the old times and I have to mention that the special effects are just plain great. Amazing work guys!!!

Finaly, I have to mention that Zack Snider did a great job in the director seat, great editing, music etc. Everyone did a great job.

I must be dreaming, a good remake of a cult classic. This not happen often!

And by the way, The begining (first 15 minutes + the generic), are just work of genius.",1100822400,,1045,4.450261780104712
2066266,4,B00027SIUK,"I'm a fan of zombie movies of all shapes and sizes (and budgets), and I knew this remake was going to be different from the original. So I sat down in the theatre and took the movie for what it's worth. Is it an exciting and bloody good fun action/horror flick? Hell yes. Does it duplicate Romero's classic? No. Is it a knockoff of 28 Days Later? Not quite.

What I liked about the new Dawn is that there's action. The dead don't lumber along making themselves easy targets, although this is the stereotype most people have of the walking dead. The dead present a very real danger and it's not so easy for the characters to just walk by them. At some points the characters barely have time to catch their breath, which adds a faster pace that the original Romero version was somewhat lacking in. So we have Action down.

As far as gore is concerned, there are quite a few juicy moments. Not quite so much flesh-tearing and gut-munching the original had, but it has its moments.

For characters, I liked a few of them and hated a few of them. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and most of the rest of the cast played great characters that felt real, even if they did bicker sometimes and fight amongst themselves. A few other characters (the two teenage girls and Bart the security guard come to mind) were walking cliches that didn't serve the story and were begging to be killed. Mekhi Phipher's character started out very realistic, but became unbelievably stupid as his girlfriend's sickness and pregnancy continued. Any person with mroe than two brain cells to rub together would have done something smarter than his character did.

So we've got action, some good characters, and some good gore to remake a classic into a pretty entertaining if not a completely faithful flick. It's a remake, so of course it's going to be different from the orginal. I also want to say that I felt the soundtrack was well arranged and well selected. From Johnny Cash in the opening sequence to the classy remake of Distrubed's ""Down With The Sickness"" at the beginning of Act II to the original ""Down With The Sickness"" after the ""extra"" ending during the final credits, I tip my hat to whoever picked these tunes.

For the special features, don't waste your time. The deleted scenes were deleted for a reason: most of them are not terribly good. The mock news broadcast and the video of Andy's gun shop were both great ideas, but unfortunately they turned out to be poorly scripted, poorly acted, and poorly executed.

All in all, watch the movie for what it's worth. Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a good time.",1100822400,,2606,4.593548387096774
2066276,2,B00027SIUK,"This movie borrows everything from the genre and returns nothing. It has taken the idea and the script from Romero's movie. It has added nothing to action footage--every explosion, bullet, brawl, punch, stab, chainsaw wound, and leap has been done in other movies and done it better in many cases. It borrows its characters: Ana is a Linda Hamilton from Terminator in training; Ving Rhames could be any of a number of strong, silent action heroes but we're most reminded (regrettably) of Sylvester Stallone; and the supporting cast are particularly reminiscent of Things Seen Before if they bother to address the issue of character at all. All of the characters are clich&eacute;s of one stripe or another that have been seen in other movies (the only real exception being Jake Weber's portrayal of Michael). The garage scene has been done in Highlander. The sewer scene has been done in Blade. The shuttle bus scene has been done in Road Warrior. Even the final credits are reminiscent--shockingly--of Waterworld (in the shot of the rising island). There is no plot. There is no insight on humanity. There is no speculation on the future. The only effect that this movie will have on the genre is that it will prove, once again, how gullible audiences of speculative fiction can be. The only thing audiences will receive in return is, at best, an adrenaline rush.

WHO SHOULD SEE THIS:

The only people to whom we can possibly recommend this movie are of two groups. The first are those die-hard fanatics of gory horror that particularly love seeing the insides of people splashed about. They should feel sated after something like this. The second group are those who really liked the original movie by director Romero--there is a certain homage to this movie, some cameo appearances by former actors, and some nods to the genre in general. Our sense is that most people who enjoyed the original movie enjoyed this updated version of it.

WHO SHOULD PASS:

There's nothing else to really recommend this movie. People of discriminating taste who want to see a zombie move done well need look no further than 28 Days Later. At least it treated the issue seriously and has some surprises to offer. Otherwise, we can't imagine any amount of alcohol consumed by the most ardent movie-fan that will make this movie seem like an Important Movie. Yes, sure, it will pump a little adrenaline. But there are countless hundreds of movies that will do that and we can't recommend this movie over any of the rest. It is a honking goose sounding its voice amidst the cacophony of a flock of hundreds--not to be distinguished and not to be heard because it has nothing special to offer.

2066277,5,B00027SIUK,"What could be more frightening than waking up one morning and finding out that the whole world is turning into zombies?  DAWN OF THE DEAD is a cataclysmic, desperate film that spares no punches in delineating the hopelessness of such a widespread and untraceable epidemic.  This remake far surpasses the original in its intensity and of course it's a much better made movie.  While George Romero's original is definitely a cult classic, it remains a low budget film that never felt real.  In Zack Snyder's version, the situation seems real and the characters' fate can only be surmised as doomed.

An intelligent script and cast help elevate this zombie flick.  Jake Weber as Michael, the nice guy next door type adds a brooding sensualism to his role; Sarah Polley has a tough endurance that makes her very likeable; Michael Kelly as the macho CJ is effective as he starts out as a smartass and ends up heroic; Mekhi Phifer is good in the role of the expectant father who must face a horrible truth; Jayne Eastwood as Norma is reminiscent of every truck stop hostess out there; Ving Rhames is solid in his cop role; and the rest of the supporting cast including Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth, do well.  The extras are okay, but they don't add much at all to the movie.

In one of the news broadcasts, a zombie, strapped down to a table in a hospital, manages to eat a doctor. How? I don't know.

2066280,4,B00027SIUK,"This was a very respectable remake of a true classic. Obviously no remake, however well done, can surpass George Romero's masterpiece, but this one definitely comes within shouting distance. And given some of the awful remakes we've seen in movie theaters lately (e.g., House on Haunted Hill), that's really saying something. I especially enjoyed the opening credits with the Johnny Cash song. Great. And Ving Rames was very good as the brooding police officer. Some of the characters, as noted in other reviews, were far too stereotypical. E.g., the loudmouthed yuppie (boy was I glad to see him get blown away) and the vivacious blond, to name only two, but that didn't detract too much from the film.

The gore aspect of the movie was definately there but, as far as making me jump outta my seat, not here.  For me, I still think the classics were better.  I really think the true horror movies didn't have to rely on gore but, more on atmosphere.  John Carpenter for instance, look at Halloween, the theme(music)from that movie still creeps me out and so does the mask too. Very little gore in that movie. Just the thought of that mask illuminating in the dark makes the hair stand on the back of my neck.  The Exorcist is another good example.  I remember having nightmares as a kid watching those 2 movies.  Not saying that horror flicks of today don't make me jump, it just feels like they have lost their touch by putting in loads of gore, high body counts, and slapping a horror sticker on the box.  I did get a big kick out of the elevator version of Disturbed's ""Down With The Sickness"" LMAO.  I would definately suggest renting this movie, it is not as bad as some reviewers have said but, don't start watching it expecting it to be a jump out of your pants/nightmare having type of movie or you may be disappointed.",1100390400,,1196,4.4

2066283,2,B00027SIUK,"This movie misses part of the importance of the original.  Some of the cast is good, but one or two play bad teeny-boppers with 2-dimensional minds.  Yes, this movie is gory, especially this unrated version which is all I've seen.  Yet, it doesn't really compare to the things that made the original Romero film great.  Lately, the movie industry seems to turn out a lot of ""highly fueled, action-packed"" remakes of great films, and I don't know why.  Admittedly, this movie isn't very bad, but I was disappointed this movie was remade at all.  The best part of this remake might have been getting sickened watching a guy with a chainsaw accidentally falling on a girl and cutting her in half when the driver overturns the van in a get-away scene.  I don't see a point here.

The original Romero flick had a point.  It was nightmarish and a statement about American consumerism, and a black comedy towards our society.  It also has superb editing, like that of a Sam Peckinpah film.  The zombies in the original don't run around like an action film, they walk like entranced mall shoppers; which is the way we ""zombified"" people look when we're at the mall ourselves.  It doesn't matter if it looked SILLY or even dated.  The horror partly derives out of that.  It makes little sense to hype it.

Why REmake a great film??  Can anybody explain this so other people understand?  The ONLY great thing ""remakes"" (of great films) do is come to home video, so the original good movie gets released to DVD (or re-released with a new authoritative DVD as in this case), and then I can go BUY THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC!  The only time movie people should ever remake a film is if the original wasn't very good, but has potential.  Hitchcock remade his own film, as did Cecil B. DeMille, which is more like correcting an error.  ""Dawn"" did not need to be remade!  Romero did fine!  The Romero Exception is ""Night Of the Living Dead"" because Romero's SFX makeup/prothetics man, Tom Savini who worked on all three Romero classics, directed the new one and it is an interesting change from the classic that stood on its own.

Maybe I'm being a little harsh.  Some of it was memorable.  But, I'm not grateful.

Romero is a competent filmmaker with some ability.  Why can't he get the budget he wants?  Why didn't those idiots who produced those terrible Resident Evil films let Romero direct their project?  Maybe making money is something I shouldn't sneer at, but unless I'm a lain-brain twit, I should want some return on the money I spend.  I can go see any slam-bang action film any day of the week, but I can't always find a film with intellectual stimulation and presence.  They should have given Resident Evil to Romero and begged him to stay rather than cave to the politics of the franchise ownership who know nothing of making movies.  The reason to get Romero is not because he will do what they say, but because you can trust him to follow his conscience.  When you get Romero, you have an interesting movie.  I point to the latest Resident Evil Apocalypse and rest my case.",1100390400,,3069,4.5911602209944755

2066320,5,B00027SIUK,"Having seen both the originals and the ""remakes"" of two of my favorite horror films - ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and now ""Dawn of the Dead"", I have to say that I do not try to compare the new to the old.  I LOVE what Zack Snyder did with DOTD.  Those opening credits with Johnny Cash singing his apocalyptic ""When The Man Comes Around"" over all those quick-cut scenes of mayhem and horror were amazing.  Right up there with the opening credits for ""Seven"" in originality.  I wish there was a soundtrack as the music in the film was amazing.  I was particularly taken with the brief bit of ""The Hangman's Song"" that was used during the scene where the survivors are reinforcing the mall trams.  Very eerie little song.  While not the most fleshed-out characters, the cast was excellent, particularly Ving Rhames and Jake Weber (and I wonder if any horror buffs noticed that two of the survivors in DOTD - Kevin Zegars and Lindy Booth - were the first victims in ""Wrong Turn"" [another enjoyable horror movie]).  The zombies were horrifying and while Romero's shambling, rotting corpses had their own brand of ""charm"", Snyder's quick-moving/running zombies were a scare of a different color.  And contrary to some other reviews, there was at least one scene where we get to ""enjoy"" one zombie dining on another (in the backroom of the sporting goods store).  So while there were no steaming entrails, there was plenty of rot, gore, graphic ""head hits"", etc. - everything this reviewer enjoys in a good horror movie.

2066321,3,B00027SIUK,"Nice try filmmakers......but the original version of this classic zombie movie cannot be extinguished with a few more sophisticated special effects.

George Romero's original movie from 1978 is still one of the greatest horror films of all time with its touch of humor, graphic gore and subtle political statements it is impossible to better. Zack Snyder has attempted to bring the original story into a new light but in my opinion he fails miserably. The story has changed and the whole concept has been modernized so that the ultimate thrill is found in the updated special effects and new zombie make-up. Sadly even the campy Romero zombies, made-up in the color of sick blueberries, outdo the new zombies. There is just something about slow moving, moaning, flesh-eating dead people, who get to invade a shopping mall and fumble around to ""muzak"" that just can't be beat. Snyder would have fared better had he chosen to maintain the original film's integrity and storyline.

The cast in this film is decent (except for the zombies) with Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Bruce Bohne and Sarah Polley being the most convincing of the actors. The zombies are scary and somehow very fast and strong in this film but the best make-up only enforces the fact that they are made-up actors. Some scenes in this film are better than many others but none really compare to the original film. The best part of this movie lies in the mystery that takes place during the ending credits....don't switch menus too quickly! Zack Snyder gave it a good try but he hasn't created a classic...that accomplishment can only be attributed to a true master George Romero.",1099958400,,1644,4.888888888888889

The mall is incidental here, thrust upon us without the nice buildup of the original's cross-country helicopter ride.  And where are the marauding bikers?  There was a quirky road trip aspect of the original that made it more than just a gore fix, and the closest thing I've found to that recently is the novel Xombies (which somebody should definitely make as a movie).

Bloody, tension filled, and even filled with surprise twists and turns, this Dawn of the Dead has far exceeded my expectations, and the nicely assembled cast (including Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Jake Weber, Ty Burrell, Kevin Zegers, and Michael Kelly, as well as cameos from original Dawn stars Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and FX wizard Tom Savini) does solid work.  James Gunn's screenplay also includes many odes to the original, and even though it does in no way shape or form work character development magic like the original, it doesn't try to, and it's all the more enjoyable for it.  There are those who will no doubt scream blasphemy (most likely the same people who turned their noses against the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake), but this new Dawn is an enjoyable horror fix.  One last thing to Hollywood though: stop remaking classic horror films while you're still ahead.

2066350,5,B00027SIUK,"My genre of choice is not horror, but I still liked Dawn of the Dead.  It was very well made, acted, everything.  The fact that the action started within the first ten minutes (I believe) of the movie let me think that it may not be so great but I was wrong.  It was pretty bloody/full of gore, with scenes that are left imprinted in your mind.  If that's your thing, this movie is for you.

Just a few things I want to comment on:

- Okay, I thought the girl who lost her family to Zombieitis, Nicole (Lindy Booth), was a total moron.  I realize her need to save her new dog was needed for the progression of the movie, but wow!  I think I would have smacked her around for risking everyone else's life.

- What was up with Andre (Mekhi Phifer) hiding his zombie girlfriend (Inna Korobkina) from the rest of the group!  That's messed up!  What did he think he was going to do with her??  She and his new baby girl were zombies.  I was so rooting for the old lady to take care of him and his family!

- When Steve (Ty Burrell) told Ana (Sarah Polley) that if he ever became ""one of those things"" she had his permission to blow off his f-ing head, I was thinking the same thing as Ana when she responded with ""Oh yeah, you can count on that.""  I am glad she did remember to grab his keys!  Imagine, a girl in a horror movie with actual brains.  Original!

- When CJ (Michael Kelly), the cocky mall security guard, finds himself trapped in the bus with nothing but a gun, a propane tank and a bunch of zombies, I was glad that for once he did something noble with himself instead of acting like a jerk.

Other than the fact that the special features were pretty funny, I think those are the only things that I had to get out about this movie.  Not so much things I didn't like.  They were just things that made me crazy while I watched!  And what good horror movie wouldn't have things like that in it?",1099699200,2,1900,4.133879781420765

2066352,4,B00027SIUK,"Zombie horror has been around for much longer than most moviegoers might imagine, beginning with the 1920's fiction of August Derleth and William Seabrook, whose ripping tales of voodoo gone awry populated the pulp magazines of their day. The pulp has long disappeared, but not the concept, which survived to a healthy film career, starting in the 1960's. Cultural psychologists might draw parallels between the proliferation of this theme and world events, social upheaval, and real human atrocity, but most horror film buffs would agree that there is a perennial attraction in the genre to the ""scorched-earth"" scenario of a world gone mad in which all things are turned upside down, inverted, and--ultimately--perverted. The structure of human society, interpersonal relations, and core values get a massive flaying when your neighbor, your husband, your children turn on you with the intent of consuming your living flesh. The best horror films play directly to the eternally taboo subjects, those which we keep under the tightest wraps, giving us the chance to explore them vicariously, without the risk of actual threat. There is a catharsis in throwing everything away for a time, in entering a world where the rules have been re-written, and all the things you worry about in your day-to-day life are gone, replaced by the immediacy of a feral and all-too-human need to survive.

""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a fairly respectful re-telling of the plot from its eponymous 1978 predecessor, in which a group of survivors, stranded in a shopping mall, attempt to survive the onslaught of the carnivorous hordes outside as well as the menace within, represented by the tendency of those living wounded to convert upon death. The special effects have been updated, similar to Tom Savini's 1990's treatment of Dawn's predecessor, ""Night Of The Living Dead,"" and the requisite gore is laid on equally thickly. I thought about counting how many zombie heads are splattered or perhaps calculating how many gallons of imitation blood were used in production, but such an effort would prove futile. Suffice it to say, the splatter lives up to the ""Dead"" legacy.

Mood is all-important in this genre, and director Zack Snyder makes some interesting and effective choices. The riskiest is in the title sequence, over which we've come to expect either the bombast of metal, the soulless trance of techno, or dark, Trent-Reznorish psycho-with-a-multitracker throb. Snyder, however, chooses to use, of all things, Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" and the effect is both unsettling and ultimately satisfying. Cash's portentous, apocalyptic lyric over the flash-cut images of both the film's zombies along with random, bizarre news footage creates a mix which informs us that whatever we were expecting isn't necessarily what we're going to get. Aside from the standard incidental-music cues (Ana's digital bedroom clock flicks it's numbers with the requisite and impossible bass *chunng*) most of the other music choices bear this promise out.

""Dawn's"" main protagonists are: Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse whose young daughter makes a surprise morning visit, setting the story rolling; Kenneth (Ving Rhames), the cop who's trying to get to the next town to save his brother; and Michael (Jake Weber), the former Best Buy television salesman who seems almost amused to discover his until-now-dormant leadership ability in the course of trying to save the few living souls he's been thrown in with. For a zombie movie, there is surprisingly good acting throughout. Rhames, Polley, and especially Weber (who so efficiently played the womanizing co-worker on the HBO series ""The Mind Of The Married Man"") convey much more complexity than any of the actors in the original, and the believability factor created by their performances greatly enhances the creeping dread. It's as if someone finally noticed that if you actually care about flesh and blood characters, you might not giggle so comfortably when they get eviscerated.

Our little group takes refuge in a virtually empty shopping mall, where they encounter only a few members of the cleaning crew (Weber's shirt gets fairly bloody in this little exchange) and mall security, who immediately attempt to establish alpha-male dominance. The leader of this group of guards is played admirably by Kevin Zegers, who manages to embody petty authority in every gesture. His transformation as the film progresses is one of the most interesting and satisfying aspects of the overall ensemble piece, and he is--quite deservedly--given the best ending line of the film. A subplot involving a husband (Mekhi Phifer) with his oh-so-pregnant wife feels oddly flat, until its ultimate conclusion provides one of the ickier moments of the many gross-outs this movie has to offer. Yes, there are some plot holes, but they don't necessarily spoil the fun.

Snyder keeps the pace up, and his use of continued story through the closing credits is admirable, concluding his tale using the jumpy, hand-held reality-tv camerawork to which we've all now become accustomed.

It is a grim world ""Dawn Of The Dead"" paints for us, and like the best horror films, we leave unnerved, re-entering our daily lives perhaps a little the better for having walked our demons around the block and tucked them neatly back in their beds, knowing that--in the tagline for another early-70's low-budget horror flick, ""The Last House On The Left""--it's only a movie, it's only a movie.",1099612800,4,5483,5.1968325791855206
2066353,4,B00027SIUK,"Sometimes whenever a long string of a certain type of movie is released, the genre seems to die out. Such is the case with zombie movies. A good many years ago America was presented with zombie classic such as titles from the '... of the Dead' series (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Day of the Dead) and the more comedic monster flicks of the Evil Dead series. Lately though the genre has seemed to of faded minus a few sub par attempts to throw zombies into the mix.

Twenty five years after its original appearance we are presented with a Dawn of the Dead remake. A zombie filled, gore fest about a plethora of people who all end up in a large shopping mall after running for their lives to escape a zombie infested city. Outside of the mall waits a city full of zombies slowly progressing further into actually breaking into these few humans base and finally taking the last of the survivors alive. Amongst these stranded survivors are a hospital worker, a policeman, a salesman, a couple (the female being pregnant), mall security guards a few others thrown into the catastrophe later on.

The movie waste absolutely no time at all before kicking things into action. Withing the first ten minutes we have had our main character introduced, attacked and already on the run. As the film progresses they really give no explanation at all as to why the zombies are there and how they came about (which, in my opinion, was a wise decision considering that most monster movies hit a snag whenever trying to concoct a reason as to why things are happening). We just know that they want human flesh.

Once the movie gets going it doesn't stop until the credits are through rolling. Not only do the characters have to deal with the reoccuring threat outside of them but also the tension between themselves which also adds for another suspense element created in the movie.

Since this is a zombie flick there are no over dramatic moments in this movie and the acting isn't top quality, but rather just enough to get by (which is okay). While the characters do spend a large amount of time escaping zombies, shooting zombies and devising plans to rid themselves of zombie, there are still a few moments thrown in where we can laugh.

I had heard mixed reviews of this movie before I rented and watched it, so needless to say I went in with low expectations. I got just what I expected. I shoot 'em up movie that grabbed me and didn't let go. Considering I didn't much enjoy it's predocessor (28 Days Later), I was surpised when I found myself enjoying this movie as much as I did.

If you don't expect much from this movie and enjoy guns blazing and zombies being shot then this is definitely your cup of tea. Considering I haven't seen the original I can only judge this movie on it's own merrit, which is a fun one time through experience. Though the rating probably wouldn't stand as high after multiple viewings, I give Dawn of the Dead an 8/10 (or 4.5 stars).",1099612800,2,3121,4.478031634446397

Remaking this is like colorizing the Three Stooges, a tragic mistake. However, Director Zack Snyder and Writer James Gunn realized this and only used the concept of the mall from the original and then took off on their own from there. This film could turn into a major classic at those midnight film events. It has all the trappings a horror film should, unexplained events, citizens in peril and a very 70's style depressing ending. (Don't turn this movie off before the credits are over). Snyder and Gunn show us characters that suffer all mankinds' foibles, great ideas and planning that, because of an event they weren't planning for, causes all their plans to fail...horribly. And, don't get me wrong I love the slow moving zombies Romero brings us, but the undead in this film with their speed and voracity make any idea of survival a very slim chance indeed. It's this speed that slowly eradicates the cast. You might be able to get away from a slow lumbering dead thing, but these creatures are sure to have you for lunch. In the end, it doesn't matter. The casts' very idea of leaving the mall to survive is the very thing... well, you'll just have to buy a copy and find out.

I disagree with some of the reviews which stated it was hard to care about the characters.  I thought all of the actors were great and Zack Snyder did a great job of humanizing them.  That's why the tacked on ending came as a bit of a shock to me, but I won't say more so nothing is ruined.  One other criticism is the speech from a preacher in the movie stating that this was all caused by the sin of man, including, but not limited to, homosexuality and abortion.  I don't remember this sermonizing in the other Dead movies.  The camera zooms in and serious music is played as the sermon is delivered.  PLEASE!  Still, it's not nearly enough for me to lower this to four stars as the rest of the movie is great!  I really cared about the characters and there were some great humorous moments.  I also disagreed with some of the reviews as I don't think the gore or special effects were overdone.  Zack Snyder is a good director and I look forward to more from him.

2066371,4,B00027SIUK,"Zombies...the living dead...is there a more misaligned population segment in Hollywood monsterdom?  Perhaps, but on the scale of sheer numbers, they seem to represent the largest group.  In general, they're not evil, malicious beings, but only doing what their limited instincts command them to do...eating the flesh (and sometimes brains) of the living, and when I say living, I mean humans, as they seem not too interested in lesser forms of life like polecats, porcupines, or plankton.  And there's that whole thing of transferring their `undeadness' (I sometimes get a cold from a co-worker, and I find that highly annoying, so I wonder how much worse it would be to catch the death in the same way) to those of us who find themselves in the awkward position of being viewed as a hot lunch for these ravenous creatures, there by propagating the species, if you will.  And let's face it, even if we could work around that whole thing of them wanted to eat our flesh, there's still the issue of rank, flatulent, rotten, putrid, decaying flesh to deal with...also, these creepy, cadaverous automatons suffer from a severe lack of personality, focused solely on the intent of fulfilling their need for our warm, juicy, tasty fleshy parts, inhibiting any attempts to open up a meaningful, personal dialog...oh well, they sure can make for some entertaining viewing...

In essence, The Dawn of the Dead (2004), directed by Zack Snyder (S.W.A.T.) is a remake of George Romero's 1978 film of the same name, and a pretty good one, at least in my opinion.  The film stars Sarah Polley (eXistenZ), Ving Rhames (Out of Sight), and Jake Weber (Wendigo).  Also appearing is Mekhi Phifer (8 Mile), Ty Burrell (Black Hawk Down, Michael Kelly (Unbreakable), Matt `what the hell happened to my career' Frewer (Max Headroom) and special effects artist/director/stuntman/actor Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn).

The film, set in Wisconsin (that's all we need...zombie cheese heads) opens pleasantly enough, with Ana (Polley), a nurse working in a local hospital emergency room, returning to her suburban home to meet her husband/boyfriend (I'm unsure which).  They share some intimacies and then retire for the evening.  Seems like a pretty good ending to a normal day...enjoy it while you can, as the morning brings forth a whole boatload of bad mojo (and zombies).  As the film progresses, a small group of survivors, including Polley, Rhames, Weber, and Phifer, make their way to a local shopping mall, seeking refuge from the insanity that has ensued, as the epidemic of the dead spreads quickly.  The local, still-living population is ripe for the picking, as they are still unaware of what's actually happening, and the nature of the disease, virus, or whatever...tensions run high as personalities clash and more information becomes available, and those not infected begin to understand the reality of what's happening, and also their new place on the food chain.  Haphazard plans are formulated and tossed about, but how do you escape from something that's everywhere?  No...this becomes an exercise in survival, and a seemingly futile one at that.  Is this the end of the human race?  Are we destined to become zombie chow for the ever-growing legion of the undead?  It's a zombie nation, and we're the minority...

I did have fun watching this film, and thought it was done well, despite certain changes from the original.  The direction from Snyder was slick, fast paced, and engaging, showing he's certainly a capable director, able to take an established storyline and infusing a certain amount of creativity, keeping most of the relevant parts, losing the outdated material from the original, while maintaining a level of respect from whence the story came.  I did feel the production lost a little bit of heart from the original film (the group here never really seemed to gel as well as those in the original), focusing more on high-tech special effects rather than the character driven elements of the story, resulting in sometimes 2 dimensional characterizations (CJ the gun totin' hick, Ana the bleeding heart liberal, Michael the somewhat logical pragmatic) that you really couldn't care for if they lived or died.  I thought the actors did reasonably well, but I felt they probably had little to work with, and ultimately wasted at times, which is a big difference for me from the original.  There really weren't any standout performances, but I did like the guy who played Steve (Burrell), the ever-sarcastic pessimist always handy with a smarmy comment.  His part was small, but memorable.  I suppose the biggest difference between this film and the source was the speed of the zombies (who look really excellent, by the way).  I think most of us are used to the shambling, doddering, slow as all out undead, ones we could easily evade, unless their numbers were too great.  Not so here as the creatures moved extremely fast, showing excellent mobility and agility.  This goes against what I would think of how a dead person would move, especially once rigor mortis begins to set.  I suppose this was done to heighten the tension, which it tends to do, but it seems entirely uncharacteristic.  I prefer my zombies to amble about, rather than running around like hyper children hopped up on Pixie Stix and soda pop.  I did like the special effects a lot, especially those of a grand nature (do kerosene tanks really explode like small A bombs when fired upon?)  Gore hounds will find sweet spots throughout, but I was a little surprised at the overall lack of visceral material (what there is is pretty intense).

The widescreen picture looks excellent, and the Dolby digital audio is clear and sharp, pretty much what I would have expected from such a recent release.  Included are scads of extra features, listed here adequately enough so I won't do it again, but I did find them entertaining and worthwhile.  All in all, I thought the effort was really good here, albeit superficial.

One of the best ways to pull people into a movie is to make the characters likable.  I found myself not caring, even the slightest, whether any of the main character were ripped to shreds by the zombies.

The movie ""28 Days Later"" managed to do a much better job with this concept.  The characters and dialogue were much more interesting.  I would recommend ""28 Days Later"" to anyone thinking of buying this film.

2066387,2,B00027SIUK,"The bigger the budget, the worse horror film you make.

This adage has proven dead on the money on this expansive, obviously slicked-up remake of Dawn of the Dead, one of the best (if not the best) horror films ever made.

I'd been attempting to watch the recent slate of horror-classic remakes with a fair eye.  Before having seen the actual films, I'd expected this film to be the best of the bunch.  After all, the original Dawn of the Dead was a high-adventure comic-book tale with plenty of set pieces and scope in itself, so how much could they screw it up?  Unfortunately, this one turned out to be the worst of the bunch, by a mile.

I'd expected the lack of horrifying ingredients, edge, and risk-taking.  What I hadn't expected was a story devoid of narrative thrust and engaging characterizations.  With the high budgets, long pre-production times and endless rewrites, shouldn't this be the strength of Hollywood features?

The Dawn of the Dead remake is first and foremost characterized by its utter lack of interesting characters.  Despite a cast which includes the intelligent, ever-watchable Sarah Polley and rock-solid Ving Rhames, there isn't a single truly compelling performance in this film.  Clearly not the actors' fault, because their characters are big black holes of nothing, indistinguishable from one another.  Mekhi Phifer is especially stuck with a non-character of stunning shallowness, fatally hurt by the wooden presence of Inna Korobkina as his pregnant wife.  The one element that this remake adds to complicate George A. Romero's original zombie concept, and director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn screw it up royally by having these two characters remain complete blank slates.  So when the moment happens, it's more an ""Oh, okay"" than what it's supposed to be -- an ""Oh my God"".  In a desperate attempt to make bigger action set pieces and splatter more gore, Snyder and Gunn pile on the characters -- to no avail.  Having something like 16 characters holed up in the mall only serves to make us never care about any one of them.  Romero achieved far more layers and touched on many more facets of the social spectrum with the four characters in his original Dawn of the Dead than Snyder does with over a dozen half-baked characters.  We don't even know most of their names, so they become utter stereotypes -- the ""old lady"", the ""rich boy"", the ""naked girl"", etc.  So when one of them dies, we simply treat him/her as cannon fodder.  When the characters of Ana (Polley) and Michael (a blank-faced Jake Weber) kiss, I groaned out loud -- when did this happen?  Why?  How?  And so what?

The story also lumbers along with lots of tiny little obstacles that never add up to anything.  While Romero's original script threw you into the middle of chaos and grips you in a sense of dread from the first minute, it took this remake over an hour before things finally start happening.  And while we're at it, the way exposition is handled in this film is simply amateurish.  ""Zombie bites make zombies"".  Even if you haven't seen the original film, seems like a pretty easy thing to guess, right?  Well, Gunn's script treats it as if it were a big reveal, a piece of news that will make the viewer go ""ahhh"".  But I'm willing to bet a brand-new viewer who's never seen the original will have guessed every single one of the setups and payoffs 20 minutes before the film finally reveals it.  And if you're gonna treat the zombie threat as if the Night of the Living Dead films don't exist (a perfectly viable narrative position to take), then work on revealing the zombie threat step by step.  The ""little girl attacking the bedroom"" scene of this film is just laughable, with no satisfying build and gradual complication.

There is one thing this film does well, and that is cinematography.  While the editing is the usual hyperactive music-video nonsense, the look of this film is wackier, less obviously commercial than most Hollywood fare.  And that's a good thing.  While it's still a relatively high-gloss look, the hyper-contrasted look of this film does contribute to the down-and-dirty zombie backdrop.

All the story and character issues aside, my biggest gripe about this film is that there wasn't a single moment where I was horrified yet glued -- namely, a single moment of successful horror filmmaking.  Even the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and even Cabin Fever (which I did not exactly like), delivered moments of arresting freakishness and sometimes downright terror.  The remake of Dawn of the Dead did not.  Blood, brains and guts splatter all over the place, but it's all predictable and more loud and obnoxious than terrifying.  So it played more as a slow action film than as a squirm inducer.

I didn't expect this film to come up to the standards of the original.  Few, if any, remakes do.  But I did at least expect a film that works on its own terms.  This remake does not -- four or five times I was tempted to turn the DVD off, and I actually did, 50 minutes in, and didn't feel the least bit guilty.  A good film should make the viewer not want to pick up the phone.  This Dawn of the Dead remake is a passable copy, at best, and an uninvolving, loud, semi-interesting mishmash at worst.",1099353600,5,5261,4.730769230769231

When there's no more room left in Hell, the dead shall walk the Earth--oh wait, that's our main cast. Barely any character development at all.

D)Horrible ""Red Herring"" moment(Rhames get cut and lands in contaminated fountain, and nothing happens.) E)Did the whole 2nd half of the film have to shot handheld with a fast shutter speed?! In movies like Gladiator and Saving Private Ryan it was in small doses and effective; here, it's just lazy. F)Crappy deleted scenes that should've been cut from the final script BEFORE filming.

If you want more classic, one of those three stage films (1.this is what is happening 2.how do we kill it/killing it/someone or more than one person was hurt or killed 3. oh crap we're going to die because someone did something stupid) see the original.

The first 25 minutes or so are great the world collapses and people begin a desperate stuggle to make it however they can.  After that the movie kind of falls flat there are several reasons for this.

1.  The lack of interesting charecters its like the world ended and only the most depressing annoying people survived.  I can honestly say that other than Steve I felt more sympathy for Andy the guy maroned in the gun store across the street than I did for any of the rest of these people.

2.  The movie introduces certain facts and asks us to ignore them I found this to be quite a draining task.  The Zoombies are super strong and have the ability in a group to take a truck and run at super speed and some little glass is supposed to stop them?

If the power is out at end than how does the elevator work for the gang to get down to the garage?

2066394,4,B00027SIUK,"OK. We got Zombies. We got a shopping mall. We got Tom Savini and a couple others from the original Dawn, check out the Televangelist. But this is by no means a remake.

I went into watching this movie very hesitant. I read the reviews and I heard the bad reviews from friends who saw it in the theaters. Well, at least in my opinion, they were wrong.

This movie is really good. So they chew the dialogue a bit.

This DVD is an absolute must-have. And be sure to go for the unrated director's cut. The extras are fantastic. Seeing how the zombies come to life and back to death is gripping. The newscast is so realistic, it gives one flashbacks to Welles' War of the Worlds broadcast of oh so many years ago.

And for the die-hard Dawn fans, there are oh so many fun tips of the hat to the original. News broadcasts that are word for word lifts from the first Dawn. And check out the name over the full length mirror. And hmmmmm just who WAS that delivering the Tag Line?

And it truly is difficult for me to say this...but in some ways this one is BETTER than the original. The original, one of my favorite movies of all times, dragged during the middle of the film. Not a lot of action, a lot of talking. Not with the ""new"" Dawn. From the first 10 minutes, which we all saw on USA Networks when they ran it to the very last seconds of the credits the movie kept you in a constant state of terror and motion. The various sub-stories inside the mall keeps you constantly guessing what will happen next.

My only real complaints have to do with the movie ending and some of the music. Without giving away anything, why put the dramatic ending of the movie sandwich in with some gawd-awful annoying music. Speaking of music, that's my other major complaint. The Rap music, while hip, is way beyond aggravating. As you are watching massive action, you have to try and tune out how many time some idiot can throw the ""F"" word into his lyrics. Yeah, that's splitting hairs..or should that be heads..but I HATE rap music.

2066405,5,B00027SIUK,"As a rule, I HATE remakes or any film based on pre-existing material (TV shows especially) but Zack Snyder and company have created a truly visceral experience that though it draws considerably from George Romero's ground-breaking film of the same title, it still manages to seem intensely vital and harrowing and not just a fawning nod from an up and coming director to a horror film legend.  This film works on many levels, but mostly on its ability to create a sense of doom and horror within the first 5 minutes and being able to maintain it through the duration of the film.  Forget the lumbering, shuffling flesh eaters that have come to represent zombies in motion pictures.  What we have here are countless hordes of rabid and intensely disturbing ""monsters"" whose ferocious tenacity and hunger is the stuff of nightmares. One thing that I found surprising was that though this film is, to a certain degree, an homage to Mr. Romero's visionary work, it doesn't attempt to overshadow it (not that it could) but aims more to be a companion piece than a usurper.  I admired that a great deal of restraint was used and that though extremely violent, it was not as gory and gruesome as I expected; the Romero original contains more scenes of flesh tearing and eating than the remake.  Everything was kept pretty much in check and though it's obviously modern it isn't plagued by excessive tendencies, like almost every film cranked out by the Hollywood factory these days. The walking dead, though, are far more frightening in the newer version, with exposed bone and gaping holes (all coming at you with the velocity of frenzied shoppers at an outlet mall on black Friday) replacing gray pallor and minor flesh wounds.  Gone are the subtle condemnations of American consumerism and materialistic principles, left is the unnerving sense of vulnerability and isolation.  Tom Savini's remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" was alright, but relied too much on make up and effects, taking the original material and just magnifying it to the tenth power with the help of more sophisticated production values and not really adding or saying anything new.  In other words, it fell short.  In this case, the gap between original and remake is very narrow, indeed. This film far exceeded my expectations and to those willing to approach it with an open mind and free of pre-conceived notions, you will find much to disturb and frighten you.  A cool little touch was the jazz version of Disturbed's ""Down with the Sickness"" (the original used in the closing credits).  Quirky details and off the wall humor punctuates the film, relieving some of the tension; very much in the vein of the original.

2066407,4,B00027SIUK,"Some Romero purists no doubt find it a sacriledge that a remake of his classic zombie film was even made.  Yes...the original stands not only as the greatest zombie movie ever made, but also a bonafide horror classic.

That said, director Zack Snyder's remake, or re-imagining if you will, has a LOT going for it.  First of all it has a much bigger budget and as a result has better special effects, better production values, and superior acting.

Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer are all names and faces that the audience is familiar with.  And look for TVs Max Headroom (Matt Frewer) in a bit part.

The Story begins with Nurse Ana (Polley) sleeping comfortably with her hubby in a nice upscale suburb in wisconsin.  Suddenly her husband is attacked by the little neighbor girl and has his throat bitten out.  within seconds he rises from the dead and attacks Ana.  She narrowily escapes in her car and finds the city on fire and people running about madly.

Soon she meets up with cop Kenneth (Rhames) and then Micheal (weber), Andre (Phifer) and Andres pregnant girlfriend Luda.  They decide to break into a large shopping mall where they encounter three mall security guards led by the aggressive CJ (Michael Kelly) who have claimed the mall as their own.

Later they are joined by another group of survivors as they make the mall their own and later try to flee by boat to what they hope will be small islands uninhabited by zombies.

Snyder has taken a page out of ""28 Days Later"" and instead of making his zombies slow and shuffling like Romero, has made them move at full speed and hell on wheels.

This does certainly make the zombies much more dangerous since they are stronger and faster and more difficult to get away from.  You're just not going to run out into a crowd and dodge them or keep them at bay with a torch.

On the other hand making them faster makes them less scary in a way.  Because they move so fast you never really get the kind of up close looks at them the way you did in the original.  That's a shame because the FX teams did a great job with the makeup, but you often just catch glimpses of the zombies.

One thing this Dawn had that the first didn't was the tough female lead in Polley.  Also standing out was Michael Kelly as the head mall security guard who is a gung-ho rent-a-cop but shines as the courageous leader at the end.

While this unrated version packs in some of the gore left out of the theatrical version, it still is not as raw and visceral as the original.  While we have many bites on victims, we don't have the dismemberment, and entrails being torn out and eaten as we did in the original.  Although there were a lot of very well-done effects of zombie heads being blown off and later documented in one of the featuretts.

The remake doesn't quite have the undertone of black comedy and social commentary of the original but does have it's share of funny moments such as when gun store owner Andy is sniping at zombie celebrity look-alikes like Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds, as well as a funny part with the security guards taking a quiz out of Cosmopolitan magazine.

In all, This Dawn is a welcome addition to Zombie Lore.  Better I think than 28 Days Later and leagues ahead of many low-budget movies, but still not a classic like the original.

Great DVD extras cover special effects, makeup, deleted scenesm Andy's secret tape, and more.

This is not an art-house film, it is clearly written for mass consumption.  Romero's Dawn of the Dead meets The A-Team.  That said, the film has a lot of scares and a lot of action.  I enjoyed it more than the first Resident Evil Movie, and more than the remake of Night of the Living Dead.  I enjoyed it about the same as Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Aliens.",1099267200,3,536,4.428571428571429
2066409,4,B00027SIUK,"One of the great things about the movie, Shaun of the Dead, is its awareness that we know all of the conventions of zombie movies all ready.  The remake of Dawn of the Dead shares some of that sensibility.  The classic setup is that, one night, everything is normal, but when the world wakes up the next morning, the apocalypse has come in the form of a war with the undead.  (We've been preparing for it for so long, I'll be a little disappointed if we never have a war with the undead.)  The best part of Dawn of the Dead is how it handles this beginning - the way the central character survives her first zombie attack and heads out of her house to see the chaos that surrounds her.

Of course, there is nothing original in this movie.  Lately, the zombie film has been making a comeback and this film is cashing in.  The new model is 28 Days Later, which this film follows; unlike the original, the zombies in this film are strong and fast (where do they get their energy?).  It also steals the ""look"" of that film, with its strobe-effect shutter speeds.

Of course, this film can never replace the original - the earlier film is too important.  However, it is still a good movie.  Think of it as an homage to the original, as opposed to a remake.  In the seventies, George Romero had to work his magic with little or no budget.  The point of this film is to make a zombie film with a big budget, first-class special effects, and good actors.  A lot of the social satire of the film is lost, but it thankfully keeps the bleak outlook of the original films.

All in all, it is a worthwhile rental.",1099267200,2,1600,4.286666666666667
2066410,4,B00027SIUK,"I have to admit that I am not a particularly big fan of remakes. Many great films are now being redone, and I can't help always asking myself the same question : Why? Why toy with something that was already good? Why fix it when it isn't broken?

I first went to see Dawn of the Dead feeling reluctant and a bit angry at the film's producers. After all, Romero's original is one of the best horror films I've seen and an amazing social commentary (zombies invade the world and they gather at a mall because they are following their instinct, their dead brain telling remembering the important things of their past - consumerism). Well, surprise surprise! The film's new version is very entertaining, scary and bloody as hell.

The new film drops some of the social commentary and replaces it with very effetive scares. When a young woman wakes up to find her young neighbour devouring her husband, she runs away from her house and soon finds herself in the Crossroads Mall, where a small group of survivors are hiding. Zombies are everywhere and there is nothing to do but wait for help to come.

Of course, the film itself knows how to handle its many characters, giving them all very distinct personalities. Some of the surivors aren't as lucky as the rest. Two of them have been bitten, and one of them is pregnant. As the disease spreads through her, we can't help but wonder what will happen to her unborn child.

Dawn of the Dead is heavy on frights, and, while remaining faithful to the previous version, it's original enough to stand on its own. It's been a good few years now for the zombie genre, what with 28 Days Later and Shaun of the Dead haunting our theatre screens. The Dead remake, thankfully enough, follows this trend. If you want to be scared, if you want a bloody good time, Dawn of the Dead should do the trick!",1099267200,2,1834,4.515060240963855
2066411,3,B00027SIUK,"I guess maybe my standards were raised a bit too high when watching this update/re-imagining of George Romero's classic ""Dawn Of The Dead."" I'm a big fan of the original, it had so much impact and is still relevant today, and it's hard to imagine someone doing a better zombie movie than Romero himself. But, I gave this movie it's fair shake. I remembered last year's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and how everyone though it was going to be a bust, yet, the movie improved on ideas from the original and went straight to the jugular with the horror. ""Dawn Of The Dead,"" however, does neither of these things. In fact, this version plays out more like an action flick than a horror. The zombies this time around, not content to lumbering around, are lively than ever (rigor-mortis what?) and go after their food with swift speed and tenacity, which you would think makes a movie scarier. But it doesn't. All I kept thinking in the back of my mind was ""What a ""28 Days Later"" rip-off."" Don't get me wrong, I loved that movie, but it shouldn't be the meter-stick by which all future zombie movies are measured (especially since they weren't really zombies in that movie). Director Zack Snyder does an overall good job with the material, as a first time director, you can't discount him much. When viewing the supplemental material on the DVD, you get the sense that he is excited by the material and really loves the genre. The good intentions were there with this movie, but for many reasons, it just unravels. For starters, I found myself laughing in spots that I shouldn't have laughed at (Am I the only one who busted a gut laughing at the part where Ana's husband is chasing her, gives up and then attacks some random lady just standing there?). The movie tried to inject light-hearted moments and some bits of black humor into parts that should have been played a bit more seriously. I hardly felt any tension in this movie (maybe something to do with hearing a swing version of Distured's ""Down With The Sickness?""). The characters aren't much to write home about, either. In the unrated cut, there is an introduction done by Snyder himself explaining how much extra character work is injected in the new cut. Boy, would I have hated to see this movie in theaters! What character? Characters go through hell and back, and seem to forget about it all in the span of a few days. One character, who lost her husband and daughter falls for the leader of the group after only, what, a week? The only character who manages to grab the emotional resonance of the situation is Mekhi Phifer's (he's great in this movie). Great actors like Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames are just wasted here and not given much to do. The characters do stupid things and half the time, I can't be sympathetic when they bite it (literally). The good parts of this movie, however, are the action. When something happens, it happens. I loved the part where the zombies were all pressed up against the fence, engulfed in flames. It looked like something straight out of Hell. Also, the gore was top-notch. True to the spirit of the original, there is no C.G.I. present (that I can tell -- I watch a lot of movies). Plus, we get cameos from actors who played in the original (Scott Reigner, Ken Foree, and Tom Savini). But overall, I walked away from ""Dawn Of The Dead"" 2004 with a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth -- which wasn't necessarily inspired by the throwaway ending (what was the point again?) There's cheap thrills to be had and for a first time out, Zack Snyder does a bang-up job. That's why it gets three stars and why I recommend at least one viewing. After watching this movie, I read that Eli Roth, director of ""Cabin Fever"" was approached to direct this movie, which makes perfect sense. This movie sets out to do a lot of things ""Cabin Fever"" did, mainly, injecting deadpan humor into deadpan horror. Unfortunately, it just doesn't pan out so well here.",1099180800,2,3941,4.599431818181818
2066412,4,B00027SIUK,"While I love Zombie movies, I am by no means an expert on the genre.  However, I don't like the hokey zombies in Return of the Living Dead, who run around screaming, ""Brains, brains!""  Zombie movies should terrorize us, not make us roll our eyes and laugh at clowns.

I enjoy this remake of Dawn of the Dead, but there's an inconsistency.  These zombies are more like those fast running, rabid ones in 28 Days Later, but the director still tries to hold on to the trance-like state of the slow moving creatures in George Romero's films.

The little girl in the beginning is slow, reaching out her arms, and biting the guy on the neck, lunging like a snapping turtle.  OK, great scene. But then she jumps up like a sumo wrestler and runs back down the hall at the woman in the bedroom.  Contradiction in her demeanor.

The husband becomes a zombie and runs after his wife in the car. The naked woman acts more like she's in a trance.......dead.

There's the bloody guy pressing up against the glass door at the mall looking and acting more like a George Romero zombie, but the one-armed jogger running high speed after the people who are trying to break into the mall seems to have the full cognizant abilities of the living.

I just prefer the slower, trance-like zombies of George Romero because they're supposed to be the living dead. Emphasis on DEAD.  The terror is them getting ahold of you and having to fight them off, underestimating them, or two or more(groups) of them getting after you. Their simple, animated, methodical relentlessness.

When they act like those in this remake they don't seem to be what I consider a zombie anymore, but just wild, crazy living people.

The other thing I don't like in this remake is how people become zombies. A virus is blamed and a person has to be bitten.  In this era of the politically correct CDC and NIH blaming everything on viruses(i.e., HIV/AIDS paradigm) I'm not surprised that this line was taken.

I like it better when anyone who dies, for whatever reason, becomes a zombie.  All the dead just get up and must be put down with a shot to the head.  Now this would cause a faster worldwide phenomenon with no epicenter of origin. People die everyday in hospitals, at home, on the roadway, out in streets, at work, wherever.  Zombies would spring up everywhere.  While people would be advised to stay in their homes, they wouldn't even be safe there.

I bought this and will watch it, but I'm waiting for the day when someone makes a really terrifying zombie movie.",1099180800,,2523,4.5768374164810695
2066413,3,B00027SIUK,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is a remake of George A. Romero's 1978 horror movie classic. Whether the remake is as good as the original depends on how your criteria.

Technology has made incredible advances in the 26 years since the original's release. The new version, fueled by tens of millions of dollars in financial backing, is a special effects bonanza. In the old days, it was difficult to set up a scene in which a truck ran over one victim. Today, it's easy enough to show five or six victims run down in as many seconds - all digitally, of course. . Less is more has become more is more.

The original had a budget of only a few hundred thousand dollars. It was a classic example of the idea that ""one's success is based upon one's ability to improvise."" Viewed as an example of a low budget movie, Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" succeeded brilliantly.

Despite it's technological superiority, this version suffers from the fact that, by definition, it can not be original. The best that can be said of it is that it might be the definitive version of Romero's story, if only he had had the money to make it this way.

Having said all that, today's version is entertaining. The story of a killer virus turning people into cannibalistic zombies remains virtually the same. As in the original, the central characters are a band of survivors who hole up in a mall. Their guns and their machismo may be bigger, but their plight is just as hopeless.

The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" should prove exciting and innovative to those who never saw the first one. Those who did see the 1978 version might be a bit disappointed.",1099180800,2,1608,4.493150684931507

2066426,4,B00027SIUK,"When I saw ""Dawn of the Dead"" at it's premiere in early 2004, my initial reaction was to criticize the movie for failing on so many levels. In fact, it took me more than a week to understand the intention of this movie.

Although it does a great job of offering ""shock-value,"" much of that dissipates quickly. And, perhaps more importantly, shock value is not to be confused with fright. Anytime a creature jumps from behind a corner, the audience is shocked, but very rarely does that shock transcend into legitimate fear.

At any rate, this movie does over several moments of intense fear, coupled with shock, and offered with generous laughs. What really makes this movie a hit, however, is the appearance of screen veteran Ving Rhames, a genius of the screen. His role as an unrelenting cop who attempts to whip the fleeing inhabitants of a mall into shape and make them submissive to him is an amazing one.

As I said before, watch this movie with the intention of thinking about it over the next week, and you will find that it is very rewarding.

For me, an avid Romero fan, this movie seemed like a crime on hollowed grounds...I did not think it would be all that glorious.

I...however...was wrong. While it was not as good as the original Dawn of the dead, I absolutely adored this movie...its my pick for 2004...and the best zombie movie thats been produced in a long time...Resident evil...28 days later...neither of these movies stand up to this classic 1979 remake.

2066428,5,B00027SIUK,"Finally!! A Director (Zach Snyder) covered all his bases and put together a fantastic movie that will be remembered for years to come.

The opening sequence to DAWN OF THE DEAD is so so good. From the subtle hints of empending doom like the nurse mentioning the man who was taken to I.C.U. from a bite, or the special report coming on the television as our two stars unwittingly take a shower and prepare for bed.

When morning comes... you as a viewer feel the dread in the air. We KNOW what the actors DO NOT and it works perfectly. The intense scene that follows, the zombie isn't slow, moaning and dim-witted and the car as ANA (Sarah Polley) drives through her neighborhood, watching the turmoil unfold as the camera zooms higher and higher to show that the world is being consumed by the deadly virus.

The movie works on all levels. Screenplay is sharp. Dialogue is crisp. Acting is top notch. The tension has payoff. There is dark humor and a great finale that carries on through the credits.

2066430,1,B00027SIUK,"The original ""Dawn of the Dead"" still reigns supreme as do films like 28 Days Later - even dare I say it Resident Evil in comparison to this awful half baked MTV borefest.  The film opens promisingly (albeit this only about 5-10 minutes in and that is including the stylishly effective credit sequence with Johnny Cash singing) and then goes completely downhill with characters you could care less about (some of these people are so grating you will want to destroy your television set in total anger), and a shocking absence of any action, suspense or detail in place and atmosphere for thirty or so minutes of the film before it goes into all the blood and carnage which I'm sorry to say isn't really all that as many of these reviewers have said...I have seen much better and on a much smaller budget.  And what is Zack Snyder, the director's obsession with so many shots of falling shotgun rounds...Gets really tedious after the fiftieth time. This is an overproduced film with a terrible script and no sense of focus and believability.  The original film grabbed you in your gut on a purely visceral level as well as stimulating your mind intellectually from a satiric and apocalyptic point of view.  Romero's film had something to say...This remake or repossession as I care to think of it in this case has nothing to say and really doesn't entertain at all.  It's like watching a slow motion car wreck but on that show Real TV with two crash test dummies in the driver's seat while really terrible music and dated 70's music like Christopher Cross is playing in the background.",1099008000,8,1584,4.683453237410072
2066431,4,B00027SIUK,"This movie proves that some remakes can actually be very good. It's smart, scary, has some dark humor and the zombies are lively and scary. The zombies don't just walk around like dull dead-heads like in Resident Evil for example. Hell this move is everything that Resident Evil could've been.

  Sarah Polly (Go!) plays a women who wakes up one morning with her husband and they both get attacked by the little girl nextdoor who became a zombie. Her husband gets bit and becomes one, so she flees her her house not knowing what is going on. After seeing the madness going on in the streets, she panicks and gets into a car accident. Then she meets a badass cop played by the...badass Vin Rhames (Pulp Fiction). They meet Mekhi Phifer (8-Mile, E.R.) and his pregnant g/f along with Jake Weber (The Cell). At the mall they meet some security guards head by C.J. (Mchael Kelly) who have claimed the mall there's and are relucant to let them stay there.

  The cast is really good but surprisingly Michael  Kelly I think has the best part. . He handles the action scenes just as good as Rhames. Plus since his character has some screws loose and actually enjoys splattering zombie brains all over, it makes his character the most interesting and fun. This movie has some the best action since Aliens dare I say. I thought I've seen enough zombie movies of late but this makes me want to see a sequel get made. The movie is also smart and strange. Is clever how Vin Rhames communicates and becomes friends with a guy on top of a store roof by flashing signs back at each other and then use binoculars to see what each other say. Plus Mikhi Phifer's g/f giving birth has to be one of the strangest and unusual scenes you'll ever see. If anything is disapointing about the movie, it's how it just suddenly ends after so much action, thrills and blood splatter. However is some action during the credits but that  makes you want to see what happens next even more.",1099008000,,1957,4.508474576271187
2066432,2,B00027SIUK,"I did not know what to think when they decided to remake Dawn of the Dead. Initially I thought it was a bad idea, and in some ways I still think it was a bad idea. With that being said this film has its good points and it's bad. First let me say the special effects were excellent in most cases. The zombies looked real enough, especially in the beginning of the film. In fact if I was to say that this film was superior in any way over the original this is where I would lay such a claim. The original Dawn zombies were covered in a grey face paint that gave the film an almost cartoonist feel. Though this cartoonist feel is something George Romero really liked, it has been an area of criticism by many. But with this Dawn film it was more believable to think you were looking at the bodies of the recently deceased that had come back to life.

Some of the good points of the directors cut of the DVD includes the addition of additional footage. When I first saw this film in the theaters I questioned how the group first got into the mall, or how the second group got into the mall after being trapped in the truck. Both these questions are answered in these directors cut either in the film itself or through the addition of the deleted scenes section of this DVD.

One final plus I found in the directors cut was that the characters were fleshed out a little more (though not much). In the Andy's last days addition of the DVD you get to know the man trapped in the gun store a bit better. Also you get a feel for a few of the other characters that were not given in the theatrical release, though overall the character development was still lacking significantly in many respects.

Unfortunately there were more things I did not like about this film then I did. The story was lacking depth overall. While the film wastes no time breaking into the action with the seemingly overnight breakout of the plague, we are still left to wonder how this whole thing happened. In the film when are main character wakes up, bam we are in zombie land. The problem the infestation is world wide and the only way an individual can become the living dead is if they are bitten. So how can it spread through the world so quickly? We know through the film if you die by any other means you will stay dead. So you can assume it's not radiation or an airborne virus. This may be of little consequence to many of you, but in order for a film like this to be believable it needs to have a sense of logic (besides the dead coming back to life).

The final problem I had with this film was the motivation to leave the mall. The characters deciding that they wanted to leave a safe a secure location with food and water because they wanted a change in scenery just makes no sense. Here again if the view is to believe the premise of this film there needs to be a sense of logic as to why the characters do what they do. The director did not justify why the characters decide to leave a safe location (the mall), to go to another location (an island) that the characters don't even know exists! At least they could have said they were running out of food or there could have been some scenes that had the zombies break into the mall and kill of a few of the underdeveloped characters. Now that would give the other characters some motivation to leave. But to have the main characters say I don't want to die in the mall so let's leave, and to have the other character say that makes sense let's do it. That does not work, and I feel that's what killed this film.

At least the one final positive thing about this movie was that it has allowed George Romero to get funding for his fourth zombie film. Let's hope that one is better then this attempted remake.",1099008000,,3738,4.266572637517631

When one sees a trailer or advertisement for a movie like this one, what would one think? Most likely that it's a waste and it's only being made for the sick people who enjoy seeing extreme blood and gore. I thought that too, at first. However, when this film was released, it earned high praise from many critics. I had to see how a movie like this could've been enjoyed by such a broad audience. And I think the main reason is that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously. Chaos is ensuing in the movie and characters still find time for humor. Zombies are flooding the mall and everything seems to stay upbeat more or less. It's just a great ambience for the overall picture.

I always thought those older ""Zombie"" movies were a little to campy if you know what I mean.... Actors painted blue walking around with their hands straight out and moaning. With this new Dawn of the Dead the Zombies actually chase down there victims down and act as if at times that are calculating a plan to attain a victim. I've always been a horror movie buff and the Dawn of the Dead was what I'd consider the perfect fright flick. [...]",1098921600,,575,4.333333333333333
2066451,5,B00027SIUK,"This movie is what a zombie movie should be! I haven't seen the old dawn of the dead so i can't compare it to the old one (but i doubt the old one is better than this) There are some acting problems that some people may not like, but i didn't mind most of it. the special effects were excellent, not as good as lord of the rings though. The first part of the movie (about the first 5 or 6 minutes) was pretty boring. but when you get into the basic story line, it gets good. this movie isn't really scary unless you think about it, if it did happen. thats the scary part. the DVD's extras are good, not excellent like the movie but good. I haven't seen the deleted stuff though. but i did see the breaking news and the Lost Tape. they weren't directed very good, and its kinda fake. People say they didn't really like this because ""it wasent as good as the origanal"".....this is a new movie. yes it was based on the origanal, but thats why they made it into a new movie.

2066452,4,B00027SIUK,"For a zombie movie, the latest DAWN OF THE DEAD (unrated directors' cut) is easily one of the better ones. It's not as scary as 28 Days Later but it's definately creepy. The acting is very good if not great. I can only emagine how hard it would be to act with a serious face when one of these crazy looking zombies is coming at you. I was pleased with the actors reactions and behaviors. The only reason I'm even mentioning the acting is because it seems, to me, it's one of the main problems with these types of movies. My guess is because it's very hard to act terrified ""good"" when it's such an absurd concept. Anyway, there are some fantastic and jaw-dropping special effects that put other zombie flicks like House of the Dead and House of a 1000 Corpes to shame, shame, shame. It also does something I felt was very neccessary, in which I praised about in my review of 28 Days Later, they made the zombies FAST...very fast. Think about it...SPEED...is the one thing lacking to make zombies truly efficient predators and when you can't outrun them by speed-walking, like most other zombie flicks, it makes for a very intense and horrifying experience. My hats off to them for making this a much more interesting and truly frightening zombie flick. It blows away all others, except...well...you know...28 Days Later.",1098921600,2,1320,4.645299145299146
2066453,4,B00027SIUK,"George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" was rife with metaphors about our consumer-oriented and materialistic society. Zack Snyder's remake also invokes those themes but also has an overriding, if somewhat simplistic, theme about life itself: live it! Don't hide in your secure little hole while life passes you by. Take the bull by the horns and take risks. The prize is worth it.

We're moved when our frightened little band of survivors decides to take the plunge and run for their lives.

Ving Rhames plays the musclebound, stoic cop. Sarah Polley a nurse who serves as the survivors' moral center and maternal figure. Jake Weber is the group's realist and motivator. Michael Kelly is also excellent as a security guard whose juvenile and nasty ways are turned by an article in a women's magazine. (See the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about!)

The pacing of the story and events that transpire are reminiscent of the first film but all in all, this is a reimagined version of the story.

The dead effects are convincing and I would actually say that this film has less gore in it than the original, though it's not short on dismemberments, exploding heads, rotting flesh and nasty flesh-eating scenes.

All in all, I really liked this movie. It's tense, suspenseful, and the characters are pretty well fleshed out (pun intended!). We want them to survive and we can relate to them. My two complaints are fairly minor, but they are 1) fast zombies: don't like 'em. It seems like they opted for running zombies to compete with the style of zombie in ""28 Days Later."" I prefer the slow, plodding kind. 2) the ending. They should have ended the movie at the credits. The story continues to unfold during the credits and not in a way that I condone. It kind of uproots the whole theme of the movie. I'll just pretend I turned off the DVD as the screen faded to black! :) I recommend you do the same.",1098921600,3,1904,4.637982195845697

This movie reminds me of ""28 days later"" (BTW another must see). Both have populations quickly lowered in number by a disease/bio-plague/whatever. They have strangers uniting against it, and the desire to get away from the mess that's become society. Granted, this movie wasn't quite as dark as 28 days later. You would be hard pressed to laugh much during that, whereas in DotD I laughed a few times. However, it's not goofy, and I have to stress that

I was saddened when one character in particular died in this movie. I'd hoped that he/she was going to make it. That said, this is one of the few movies that I'm actually looking forward to seeing again.

2066468,4,B00027SIUK,"Despite the fact that I like this movie a lot, and am giving it 4 stars, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do nothing but complain during this review.  By and large, this is first-rate, as far as mainstream, unadventurous action-horror goes, which is more than enough to entertain, and typically enough to earn 5 stars from me, were it not for a number of annoying things. But it's still a lot of fun.

First and foremost, any comparison to the original Dawn of the Dead is senseless.  They may have the same title, but other than the fact that it's a zombie movie which uses a mall as the primary set, and a few references to Romero's  films visually and thematically, they have absolutely nothing in common.  I'll admit that I like the original more, but they're so different that this doesn't really matter as long as they're both good in their own way.  Though it does annoy me that they decided to name it Dawn of the Dead.  Frankly it's just silly to do so, and had they given it a different title the references to the Dead films would've been a lot cooler, and come across as hommage instead of lipservice.(Though they are still kinda cool, particularly the double reference to Night and Dawn involving Tom Savini as a sheriff.  On a related note, Anna's husbands behavior as a zombie kinda seemed like a Re-Animator reference, what with the headbutting, and just his movements in general, but I'm probably seeing something that isn't really there)

As I said, this is basically Action-Horror and it does both of these well enough.(Though I think a bit more straight-up horror would've been nice) This film is clearly heavily influenced by the great 28 Days Later, though it still quite a bit more traditionalist than that film.  It is very slick and professional, naturally, nicely shot, although largely in a fairly perfunctory manner, with effective if fairly unremarkable music, and pretty much flawless visual effects.(The only notable FX flaw is the not so hot looking CGI masses of zombies, but they aren't used all that much)  The acting is generally quite good, better than I would have expected in such a film, and probably better than is truly necessary.  The opening scenes standout.  They're quite scary, I think, and Anna's nightmare drive out of her neighborhood does a really great job of creating a sense of mayhem.  As the movie progresses, it becomes less interested in horror and more interested in action. Fortunately, the action scenes are quickly paced and intense, and far more coherent than they tend to be nowadays.  Snyder and company also do a good job of bringing in Romero-esque themes, with a conflict between the first group of survivors and the power-hungry and violent security guards at the mall, who apparently see the collapse of society as a golden oppurtunity to act like jackasses with impunity.  Also, towards the end of the movie there is a great accidental death by chainsaw, which is very Romero-esque in its utterly random and senseless nature.

Now, on to the problems.  First and foremost, the pregnancy subplot is totally weak.  Defintely a bad idea, exceuted slightly better than I would've imagined, but it still shouldn't have been in there.  It's very, very weird, but not in a good way.  Also, the characters in this film are either not developed in the least,(which I don't mind, really) or completely generic and cliched.(which I do mind, although not really all that much)  Worst of all is jerky-sarcastic guy, whom I belive is named Steve.(I'm coming up blank on names right now)  Everything that dude says is meant to make us hate him, and it's quite clear that we're supposed to all cheer when he dies.  First of all, this is just an annoying, manipulative tactic, and second, they don't really pull it off.  He isn't a character at all, just an insensitive quip machine, and I don't give a damn when he gets blown away.  Despite the shallow development, most of the characters you are supposed to like are actually fairly sympathetic, particularly Weber as the utterly infalliable and selfless guy. (I also rather like isolated man atop the gunstore across the street.  It's hard to say why, as he hardly does or says anything, but I do)  Finally, towards the end the plot gets somewhat whacked out, relying largely on unbelievable stupidity, and their final plan for escape is just pretty weird.

Personally, I find the difference between the Director's cut and the Theatrical cut to be  pretty much insignificant.  For the most part, already existing scenes were just made a bit longer, with a bit more dialogue at various points in the film, none of which makes much of a difference in how we view the characters.  As far as gore goes, I didn't notice too much of a difference either, and it is still substantially less gory than the original or Day of the Dead.(Though the effects are far more advanced than in the former, naturally) I presume there are some more headshots, possibly quite a few, but nothing really jumped out, and I'm pretty confident there wasn't any extra gore other than headshots.(Actually,the accidental death by chainsaw seemed a bit gorier to me, but I could just be remembering wrong.)  Sadly, we still don't see any flesh eating, and we don't even see live people get bit much either.  How you could make a zombie movie without anyone cramming any goo-covered gelatin in their mouth or just pretending to do so with pig-gut is beyond me.  Also, the shotgun-head-explosion is weak.  They telegraph it too much, and it's too explosive.(It's the suddeness of it that makes it work in the original, and the fact that you just saw that in a movie from the 70's)  This may be a realistic shot, I wouldn't know, but it defintely isn't very interesting.  Still, it delivers quite a bit of gore, and the rest of it is very well executed.  They make lots of the headshots abnormally chunky, if you get my meaning, which is pretty effective, and the aforementioned chainsaw death is a real standout. Truly disturbing and horrific.

Yeah, this is a good movie.  If you like zombies you ought to like this.(Provided you aren't an elitist jerk who's gonna hate any mainstream zombie film, apparently oblivious to how incredibly popular Romero's zombie films are.)",1098835200,2,6240,4.772811918063315
2066469,1,B00027SIUK,"Why did i laugh so much?, when im watching a so called horror film i don't want to laugh, i want to be shocked.  Comedy and horror don't mix, because i cant be scared if something is making me laugh.  The violence isn't anything special, and mostly is just a poor atempt to make it shocking but it doesnt work, especialy when they are sitting around on the roof playing a game to see if some guy can shoot the zombie that looks like a celebrity, yeah thats scary, they're havin too much fun to try and pull off a scary situation, it seemed like fun to me.  They also never explain why everybody turned into a zombie, at least not in a way that makes sense.  Its also incredibly predictable and you know everything before it happens, its so obvious.  It made me laugh, not necesarily a bad thing but when im watching a ""scary"" movie i don't want humor, the performances weren't anything above soap opera level, the story isn't exactly somethin you could make a good movie with in the first place, so i guess you shouldnt expect anything from this because you will be disapointed, i guess my hopes were to high for movie with zombies that didn't suck, every movie ive seen with zombies does (28 days later, resedent evil 1, house of the dead i cant believe they ruined that game, it was great, the movie was ridiculous, the list goes on...) and this is no exception.  1 out of a 10 for making me laugh, think of it as a comedy and you might not be so disapointed.",1098835200,3,1461,4.294545454545455
2066470,4,B00027SIUK,"It's always a gamble to remake a classic even if the original is a low budget independent horror film. Zack Synder's remake of George Romero's 1978 film ""Dawn of the Dead"" is every bit as vital, scary and gory as the original film. It's also as unique in its own way as the original film. Synder and screenwriter James Russo keep Romero's basic premise intact but go their own way with much of the story. A mysterious virus has caused the dead to be resurrected as mindless, hungry zombies. These guys aren't your typical lumbering, slow motion zombies either. They're fast moving and deadly (much like those in ""28 Days Later""). Once you're bitten by one of the living dead, you will die and become one of them yourself.

Sarah Polley plays a nurse who hooks up with a police officer (Ving Rhames)and others fleeing the carnage. They take refuge in the local mall (much like the original film). Here they encounter a trio of security guards who have taken control of the site. At first the group of four strangers are kept under lock and key but, eventually, the tables turn. Unfortunately, the flesh eating zombies are always just outside the door waiting to get in. Like the original, the film dives right into the tense action sequences that dominate the first half of the film. Towards the middle of the film the pacing slows down just a little bit as the survivors make their home in the mall and invite other survivors in as well. The character development and performances here make this more than your standard horror movie. I read a review here that stated the person preferred the original theatrical version. I beg to differ as I feel that the Director's Cut is much more complete and allows for the characters to distinguish themselves as to who they were prior to the crisis. This makes characters that much more believable.

The DVD transfer looks pretty darn good. The greenish tinge to the film, oversaturation of color and dark image quality was inherent in the original theatrical version. There's some minor haloing effects but, other than that and a few digital artifacts, the representation here is very, very top quality. The colors are true to the original theatrical version and the sharp image quality makes this one to use as a demo for a high end DVD system for most of the film. The 5.1 Surround Sound mix comes across with crystal clarity and the surround speakers are well used to drop you right into the middle of the survivor's experience.

The unrated edtion has some pretty cool special features as well. ""The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed"" is a short DVD film that was made specifically for the DVD release and focuses on a gun shop owner stranded on his roof across from the mall who communicates with the survivors via signs. Likewise, the second film ""Special Report: We Interrupt This Program"" is kind of an extension on the TV footage we briefly glimpse in the movie. It's actually original to the DVD itself and both are unique in that it expands on the original movie's scope and concept. Neither has the best production values nor the best acting but considering that they were made for this DVD release, that's not a surprise. It's like reading two short stories related to a larger novel in that it expands on the experience.

We also get a really good audio commentar from Synder and his producer as well as 12 minutes of deleted scenes that weren't put back into this edition. It's clear why most were cut--they didn't work or didn't add anything to the experience. It's still good to have them here. ""Attack of the Living Dead"" looks at how some of the deaths of people and living dead was created for the film. It might be too much information for some folks. The featurette ""Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads"" says everything it needs to in its title.

All the featurettes are, for the most part, exceptionally good. If you purchased this at Best Buy or one of the other stores, some were including an extra disc with three featurettes. I haven't had a chance to watch this extra disc yet but given that it isn't included here, I'm not going to really go into it.",1098835200,2,4146,4.658469945355192
2066471,5,B00027SIUK,"Yes, there was another film called ""Dawn of the Dead."" Yes, that film was quite good. Perhaps it was even better than this film. But it was not the least bit scary. Sorry, but it's true.

The original film featured actors so wooden they were hard to distinguish from the walking dead, special effects that were laughably primative and a campy Muzak soundtrack straight from the J.C. Penney hit list. In that film, people could safely outmuscle zombies with a weak shove and outrun them at a light jog. There were, for sure, creepy elements to the film. But its endurance and appeal has much more to do with its satirical message than its visceral effect.

This new film is all viscera, both literally and figuratively. These new filmmakers took all that was genuinely creepy about the original picture and focused their efforts on enhancing those elements.

Aren't you convinced you'll be among those lucky few to outlast the Apocalypse? It's because you're special, right? Well, what will you do to justify that calling? Is it enough just to survive?

The group leaving Andy's Gun shop and being inside to suddenly everyone being outside and guns ablazing! It didn't make any sense and it was a sloppy, sped up edit. Well, these errors have all been fixed with the director's cut and these choppy scenes flow better, and actually add for a faster, more suspenseful pace to the movie.

When I watched the special features,clips of the movie with the director talking,the color is picture perfect of the clips. I don't know if that is how the film is supposed to look, dark and grainy.

2066486,4,B00027SIUK,"The theater experience of watching this movie at it's midnight showing is one of the most enjoyable, and exciting moments i've ever had in a movie theater. Too bad Zack Snyder has to be popmpous and give 12 extra minutes to a movie that was already a fan favorite by itself. The extra footage is mostly character developements, like a lead male being a tv slaesman. Not too interesting since his most revealing, and heartfelt confesssions come later in the dinner scene. The extra footage slow down the movie, and make it a bit of a chore to sit and watch through. There's a reason why the theater version was a blockbuster. It was edited perfectly, and the pace was flawless. As Tom Savini said what you don't see adds more of an affect than over the top gore, and story devlopement.

As for the extras  good and fun for geeks like myself who love the tv scenes in ""night"" and ""dawn"". Unfortunately the acting is atrocious as stated in previous reviews. I to would have rather had trailers, tv spots.

2066488,5,B00027SIUK,"To my surprise I really liked ""Dawn of the Dead,"" even in this no holds barred unrated director's cut.  Like many others I considered George A. Romero's original version of ""The Night of the Living Dead"" to be the classic low budget horror film of all time and I also have a strong sense of affection for the original version of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" with its wry commentary on American consumerism.  So I was wary of a remake, especially given that director Zack Snyder was a feature film novice and writer James Gunn wrote both of the Scooby Doo movies.  But by the end of this film I was grooving to ""Down with the Sickness"" during what is one of the most unsettling end credits ever.  This had to be one film where everybody stayed in the theater until the light came on and then thought twice before they went outside to their cars, especially if they went to the late show (like a true horror fan ever goes out before dark to see a movie).

The basic story is the same as the original.  A group of people fleeing from the zombies get into a shopping mall, where they find another group of people, security guards, who are not really happy to see them.  So they have to hole up in the mall while the number of zombies outside trying to get in grows and grows.  Ana (Sarah Polley) a nurse meets up with Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a cop.  They then find Michael (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer), and his pregnant wife, Luda (Inna Korobkina).  They barely get into the mall ahead of a small group of zombies and then butt heads with CJ (Michael Kely), and his and his sidekicks Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry).  Later on a truck shows up driven by tough lady Norma (Jayne Eastwood), Frank (Matt Frewer) and his daughter Nicole (Lindy Booth), sexy Monica (Kim Poirier), smartass Steve (Ty Burrell), and good ol' Tucker (Boyd Banks).

Basically the movie is divided into two parts.  Most of the movie the group is just trying to keep things together inside the mall.  Then in the final act they make a break for it.  The best bits are in that first section and what helps during the great escape attempt is that these people are not too stupid, which is quite an accomplishment for a horror film where stupidity often runs rampant.  In the mall there are two intense scenes, the first involving the decision to kill one of their members who has been bit, and the second involving Luda going into labor (yes, what happens then is even worse than you can imagine).  In between there are some moments of black comedy as they find way to kill time and kill zombies.  Across the street at Andy's Gun Shop poor Andy (Bruce Bohne) is on the roof, all alone, able to communicate with the mall rats by writing messages on boards.  There is some nice pathos with Andy to go with the black comedy of the games he plays with his new friend Kenneth.  Of course, there are also a couple of memorable muzak moments involving grotesque irony.

Because this is a 2004 film the zombies have to be seriously upgraded.  Forget the lumbering ghouls of the original films, because these zombies are not only faster but not as stupid.  There are also a lot more of them and the film has a couple of chilling shots and sequences where we get to see wall to wall zombies (or the entire parking lot of the mall filled with zombies at night).  I approve of the changes because it allows Snyder to up the pacing and the horror.  There is also a corresponding upgrade of what the living at able to throw at the dead that would make ol' Hank Hill pretty happy.  Add to this the effective use of the ""Aliens"" rule, which is that as long as what you are shooting with your big gums are not human, you can blow them to bits and the blood and gore does not really count.  You know what special effects are like today and there are enough zombies getting blown away for everyone to find one or two demises that appeal to their inner warped little child.  Fortunately the three principles, Polley, Rhames and Weber, are all decent people, even in the face of the end of the world as we know it, so you do not feel like you are wallowing in the depths of human degredation (besides the flesh eating zombies).

However, given what works in the film several of the DVD bonus features are pretty lame in comparison.  There is ""The Lost Tape"" that reveals Andy's terrifying last days and basically turns that interesting character into a joke.  Equally painful is the ""Special Bulletin"" segment, where nobody comes closer in terms of performance or effectiveness to what we get in the opening credits as bits and pieces of information about the collapses of society flash by.  In contrast, the beginning of ""Raising the Dead,"" where we see a hundred extras lined up in zombie makeup, is better than those other two bits.  Then we get the director and prosthetic makeup designer David LeRoy Anderson delineating the differences between Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 zombies in terms of makeup that makes it seem like a totally reasonable way of approaching the universe.  There are other features on the special effects (e.g., ""Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads"") and a commentary track with director Zack Snyder and producer Eric Newman where they both seem rather pleased with the result, and while this remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a lot slicker than its competition in the 21st century zombie movie category (to wit, ""28 Days Later""), it does have its moments.",1098748800,3,5449,4.515274949083503

Where 28 DAYS LATER starts out decent, but takes itself too seriously and RESEDENT EVIL ends up a slipshod version of a video game that's actually more cinematic and eerily realized than the film, is exactly where DOTD triumphs.  Given a decent budget, a fine cast, a fun script, and inventive, assured direction by ZACK SNYDER, this is THE modern zombie movie that gets it right.  A thoroughly enjoyable splatterfest of thrills and chills that does the original film proud whilst staking it's claim as it's own great flick.

It was a savage blend of action, gore, and satire.  It remained my favorite horror film for many years.  I didn't think it could be improved, but I was so wrong.  Zack Snyder's version is a frenzy of action and gore galore.  This film moves at a great pace.  The Director's Cut features extra gore, and some talkie scenes that I can see why they were cut.

2066492,4,B00027SIUK,"I might be in the minority here when I say that I have not seen the original, George Romero film. So, I cannot compare the two. I can say that this re-make is one heck of a fun ride from start to finish. It's a real balls to the wall horror film filled to the brim with blood, guts, gore, guns, and explosions. I haven't seen a bloody good time film like this in a long time. The plot is pretty simple and to the point. Some kind of outbreak has the citixens of Everett, Wisconsin turning into cannibalistic zombies wreaking havoc on the town and feeding on human flesh. If you get bit, you are infected. It will only be a matter of time before you are one of them. A small band of survivors from this outbreak get together and take refuge in a shopping mall. The survivors is led by the beautiful Sarah Polley, who plays Anna, a nurse. Ving Rhames plays Kenneth, a tough cop. Jake Weber plays Michael, a TV salesman, and ""ER"" actor Mekhi Pfifer is also included. The band of survivors must fend off the intruding zombies and figure out a way to stay alive.  The action pretty much gets going within the first few minutes. It just starts and never stops. The survivors are in the mall within 10 minutes of the movie's start. I like how the movie is shown very normally in the beginning. Anna going home to a perfect, idyllic suburban neighborhood, and then all this breaks loose. The film has a major advantage by having a tremendous, above average cast. Indie darling Polley, and Rhames. Polley is definitley a welcome addition to the horror heroine fold and she definitley holds her own. She's smart, brave, and tough. One of the best heroines to come along in a while. Rhames is a man and actor of incredible presence and intensity. He's perfect in the role of Kenneth. The others are just as good. Character actor Matt Frewer briefly pops up, looking sickly even before he gets sick!. Also expect cameos by make-up genius Tom Savini and original star Ken Foree as well. On an interesting note, Lindy Booth who plays Nicole, and Kevin Zegers who plays security guard Terry, played an ill fated couple in the horror flick, ""Wrong Turn"". The make-up and gore is zombie-tastic, courtesy of David Anderson(Heather Langenkamp's husband). There is enough death, blood squirting, and heads exploding by bulletts to please all gorehounds. The script is sharp and tight and the characters, thanks to the performers, are all pretty well rounded and formed. There are the typical types of people you would expect to find in such a film in such a situation. The sarcastic jerk, the creep everyone wants to get it, and so on. But what would it be without it and the ensuing conflict that it delivers?. The dialogue is solid and realistic, and it, and the direction, keeps everything moving right along at a frentic, hair-raising pace. I hear about the social commentary used in the first film, but this one seems to not pick up on it much.  There are nice bits of humor here and there, but not enough to make it a laugh type film. The humor is real and comes out of the situations. Like the instrumental muzak version of ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" playing over the monitor when they first get into the mall. There's more like that. I should have seen the original first, to compare better, but I really don't like doing so. No one is going to think much of a re-make of their favorite movie no matter what. All I can say is that this is a rip roaring film. A real bloody good time.",1098748800,3,3467,4.475513428120063
2066493,5,B00027SIUK,"If, like me, you saw the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" in the theaters in March and were blown away by it, you've probably been waiting anxiously for it's release on DVD.

And the wait has been a long one.  In an era, when more and more DVDs are hitting stores only three months after their theatrical release the new Dawn has taken a relatively long time, roughly six months.  I'm here to tell you the wait was worth it.

Not only does the film sustain its impact on the small screen but the bevy of extras here are so good they'd be worth buying as a separate standalone DVD.

As to the film, if you're one of those naysayers who skipped the new ""Dawn"" in theaters because you thought remaking George Romero's brilliant 1979 original was disrespectful, get over it.

First, remaking any movie can be a potentially dicey proposition.  But when you remake a movie hardly anyone saw, you've got free reign to do whatever you want since most people won't know the original source material anyway.

When you remake a well-loved classic like  ""Dawn of the Dead,"" you've got to contend with people's memories of the original and how those memories will shape and form their expectations of the remake.

While Romero's first zombie film, ""Night of the Living Dead,"" still stands up as the scariest of the original ""Dead"" trilogy, it was ""Dawn"" that became a global box office sensation.  That film also drew the blueprint for just about every zombie film that has been made since.

The original film's influence is so pervasive that even a movie like ""28 Days Later,"" which wasn't really a zombie film got marketed as a redefinition of ""zombie horror.""  That film's director Danny Boyle also acknowledged that his movie's supermarket scene was homage to ""Dawn.""

When you consider this, you realize that the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not only competing with the original but also with its legacy.  Therefore, key to enjoying it is viewing it with an open mind.

Having done so, I can say that the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" is brilliant.  Scary, fast-paced, and gripping (the first 30 minutes are the most harrowing of any movie I've seen since ""Saving Private Ryan"").

Much credit has to go to director Zack Snyder and scriptwriter James Gunn.  Perhaps in recognition of the original movie's greatness, the pair have reimagined and reinterpreted the premise of the original for a new generation.  In other words, much like Steven Soderbergh's ""Ocean's 11"", this isn't a remake as much as it is a new story with the same basic premise.  Only the mall setting and the presence of zombies remain the same.

The idea of zombies who move like Olympic sprinters on crack may take some getting used to but it adds to the intensity of the film.

One change that's likely to prompt controversy with purist fans of the original lies with the origin of the zombie plague.  Romero's movies never fully explained what caused the dead to walk but fans of ""Night"" will recall that that film implied that weird radiation brought to Earth by a malfunctioning space probe was responsible.  This suggested that anyone who died, even if it was by natural causes, would become a zombie.

By contrast, the new ""Dawn"" characterizes this as a disease spread by the bite of a zombie.  This is an interesting premise but it raises a question the movie doesn't bother to answer: Namely who is patient zero i.e. the first zombie?

One other change is that this film focuses on a much larger cast of characters as opposed to the first movie's core group of four.  While this allows for more subplots and personality dynamics, the larger cast results in some characters being given the short shrift.

But ultimately it is those standout performances that make ""Dawn of the Dead""  a first rate action-horror film.  Sarah Polley and Jake Webber give star-making performances and the always dependable Ving Rhames and Mekhi Phifer are also noteworthy.

Though the DVD would be worth buying for the film alone it also boasts a plentiful set of extras that lift this DVD to the status of one of the best DVD releases ever.  Especially notable is the video diary of Andy, the gun storeowner.  Though a minor but ultimately pivotal character in the film, the movie never really allowed us to get to know him.

The video diary is ""recovered"" camcorder footage Andy shot to record the onset of the zombie plague, the succeeding days, and his ultimate demise.  This footage is chilling, riveting, and leaves the viewer with an even deeper sense of sympathy for this character.

Also noteworthy is ""We Interrupt This Program,"" a compilation of ""news"" footage detailing the zombie onslaught through the eyes of an anchorman who goes from uber-professional to emotionally shattered as the hours pass.

Buyers take note, if all of the above weren't reason alone to buy this, be advised that some locations are selling the DVD with a special bonus disk with even more undead goodness to take a bite out of. Also, this DVD is available in two versions, the theatrical release and an unrated, extended Directors Cut.  Both versions are great and worth buying.

All in all, this is a spectacular DVD presentation for that rarest of movie animals: a remake that equals and arguably surpasses the original.

This is movie that grabs you by the throat and never lets go.  If you saw it in theaters you'll want to buy it immediately.  If you didn't, buy it anyway.  You won't be disappointed.",1098748800,5,5424,4.717321997874602

2066495,3,B00027SIUK,"First off let me begin by professing my love of the zombie horror genre. These movies scared me as a child and they still freak me out as a grown man. I saw this movie in the theatre and thoroughly enjoyed it. Thusly, when I saw the heading ""Unrated Directors Cut"" I was excited to see what had been added to the film to warrant the usage of such a term. I've been burned before with other movies that have made similiar claims and I probably should have known better in this case, but what can I say...I'm and optimist. Now, if the makers of this DVD claimed that it was an ""Unrated directors cut"" because of a bunch of crappy second rate extras, than I would say they got it right. The problem arises when they make claims implying additions to the body of the film. Here's what it says on the packaging...""The Extended Version Too Scary For Theaters!""...""Packed with more blood, more gore, and more bone-chilling, jaw-dropping thrills, Dawn of the Dead Unrated Director's Cut is the version too terrifying to be shown in theaters!"" I just watched the entire film on DVD and didn't notice even one extended scene or added scene. So as far as I'm concerned this is the same version shown in the theatres. Extras and bonus scenes when not added into the context of the film are just that...extras and bonus scenes. They could have called it ""Dawn of the Dead"" Special Edition or something like that. It goes without saying that theatres don't play bonus scenes and extras, that's why most people buy DVDs. If you liked the movie when you saw it in the theatre or are sure you'd like it than buy it, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary. As for me...I have to learn to start renting movies again!",1098748800,2,1704,4.464743589743589
2066496,4,B00027SIUK,"This is one of the better zombie movies I've seen. As some others have said, it is really not a remake of Romero's classic: this is a different movie with a different purpose, so rating it poorly because it isn't the same is a mistake, I think -- it isn't meant to be the same. It isn't about satire and social commentary, as was Romero's. It is about fear and shock. The fear in this movie is not about creeping zombies coming at you slowly until you can't escape; it is fast-paced, immediate, and chaotic. As I said, a different movie altogether, but very interesting and scary in its own right. And it does it very well -- the opening scenes of the movie are phenomenal, and that alone makes the movie worth watching. In those first ten minutes, you see the world collapsing at terrifying speed, and it feels very real. Amazing.

Beyond that, the characters, although not really fleshed out, are interesting because they are so ordinary (aside from the requisite sarcastic, aloof man), and behave in the way we might really behave if, well, we found ourselves surrounded by zombies. The seemingly ever-present media clips in the movie give ongoing glimpses of the world outside, as it falls more and more into chaos and despair, and I like that touch, too, since it adds to the general feeling of hopelessness and desperation they feel. The ending is a shock, and I have read some complaints about it, but I really liked it. I am not a fan of zombie movies where everyone you like survives, those you don't like die, and the good guys end up somehow happy and safe despite the zombies crowding the world.

If you are looking for a zombie movie along the lines of Romero's, check out Shaun of the Dead. Now *that* is a true classic. Funny and satirical, as was Romero's, although it comments on different aspects of life, and still scary. With the slow-moving zombies, too.",1098748800,4,1875,4.5773809523809526

2066499,4,B00027SIUK,"Yes, there is no denying Hollywood marketing executives have ""contaminated"" this film to cater to their targeted demographic. I refer to the extreme grunge music which bookends the film for the benefit of young males. And yes, state of the art special effects have caught up to zombie films. In this case, as in so many others, they tend to overshadow or sacrifice character development entirely. Like I always say special effects do not a movie make. Even one of these elements can ""murder"" a film's quality but this film hasn't completely ""expired"".There were two factors which salvaged Dawn of the Dead.<br />
<br />
  Naturally being a re-make, the movie loosely followed the story line of the original and even made references to other zombie flicks by presenting character types and situations from Day of the Dead, 28 Days Later and others. This film did what the other zombie films didn't. The film presented the guidelines of the genre and broke the rules. The signs of hope, the overcome struggles, the glimmers of a possible future and escape routes were all closed off leading to a ""dead"" end. (Sorry, I had to do it). I found it to be eerily caustraphobic.<br />
<br />
  The most important thing which saves this film from an agonizing ""death"" ironically is the zombies themselves. These are without question the scariest i've seen in any film. The attention to detail, the make-up and special effects isn't what i'm talking about here. There seem to be alot of thought put into how these zombies would behave. They do move quickly and rabidly like in 28 Days Later but they react to threats, wonder aimlessly at times,and they lurk and stalk in groups as they growl like wolves. <br />
<br />
  Maybe this remake doesn't ""live"" up to the political and social commentary of it's predecessor. So what! we're talking about zombies here. Maybe the character development is a little weak but theses things didn't stay with me after seeing the movie. This film tapped deeply enough into a childhood fear to keep me looking over my shoulder for days. <br />

2066500,4,B00027SIUK,"I think that George Romero's Original ""Dawn of the Dead"" is perhaps the greatest Horror film ever made.  It's certainly the most personal, and it has a social commentary that was a staple of 50's and 60's horror that has fallen by the wayside, a bit.  So when I heard it was being remade, I was upset.  Then I saw the firsr trailer of the film, and I decided to give it a shot.

This ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not a remake of the original.  It borrows elements-average people in a mall, rampaging hoards of the undead, cameos from the original cast, but it's essentially a carnival fun house of a film, fast paced, tightly plotted, and as entertaing as it is creepy.

Starting quickly, the first 10 minutes, as we're introduced to the general situation, a feeling of dread hits you before the first frames hit the screen.  You know what's coming, but the suddenness of it all is still just as shocking.  The first 10 minutes, which play right before the credits, are genuinely terrifying, with some excellent visual choices from the director and a good capture of the confusion one would experience if all of a sudden zombies started eating people in your heighborhood.  As the prelude comes to and end, and the credits smash in with Johnny Cash's apoclyptic ""The Man Comes Around"" playing over shots of chaos as the world goes up in blood and guts, you can feel that this movie is going to have at least one thing in common with it's prdecessor-it's going to be fun.

The rest of the film deals with the survivors in the mall.  There are more of them than in the original, and you really only get sketches of who they are, with the exception of the Sarah Polley Character and Ving Rhames' cop.  But the film does a good job of sorting out who you'd like to see eaten and who you wouldn't.  The film is also not afraid to kill off likeable characters, and there is one scene involving Matt Frewer and his daughter that touches on the intensely emotional situation that the survivors are really denying.  It's a string moment in a film dedicated to basically scaring you.

The zombies are actually pretty good here, though I will always prefer Romero's shuffling corpses to the ""super-fast"" dead in the remake.  While the running zombies seem more terrifying, the shuffling, relentless zombies are actually scarier, as their slow movement would dare to give survivors hope, where the fast ones are pretty much gauranteed to get you.  Still, the makeup effects here are well done, and the zombies, as always, need a head shot to go down.  There are also a series of set pieces, in underground garages and even a sewer, that really rachet up your senses.  The film does pause for a lighthearted moment, perfectly scored with the Richard Cheese cover of ""Down With the Sickness"".  The film's director, Zack Snyder, got his start in music videos, and the he effectively conveys a lot of the dark humor in the film with his musical choices.

Is this film a classic?  Probably not.  But it's slightly better than ""28 Days Later"" because it doesn't quite fall apart at the end and it stays consistent with it's vision of the apocalypse played out with zombies.  I think Romero would be proud, and I think any horror fan will love this film.",1098662400,7,3228,4.564236111111111

Pros-

The film-makers did a great job of bringing realism to the character situations and what it might be like if something like this were to ever occur. That was scariest part to me. Along with some nice Hitchcock aerial shots to give you a bird or god's eye view of what is happening down below to the poor humans. The film was very intense.

Cons- ( but not so bad, obviously)

Even though Universal ( or whom ever )took the cowards way out and released the film with an ""R"" instead of an ""Unrated"" like the original and the films gore was so so it still made up for those downfalls with its over all disturbing factor. Also the choice to make the zombies run and that it was caused by some sort of disease. Zombies are zombies, what makes them scary is not knowing what made them the way they are, and that they steadily and slowly are coming for you....they are DEAD and want to spill your guts and bath in them. I don't need them diseased and running, leave that crap to the UK and their artsy 28 days. I was actually disappointed to see that ""Shaun of the Dead"" (which I'm buying as well) paid more homage to George Romero and had the stomach O guts scene, but DotD did not. :(",1098576000,,1256,4.177685950413223
2066503,4,B00027SIUK,"In 1978, director George Romero served up a fantastic horror film that was an interesting blend of satire and gore. The mindless zombies, careening about a shopping mall, served as a sharp sendup of mindless consumerism. (The same year, director Philip Kaufman gave us another satirical horror film, sending up the psychotherapy/me generation culture in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers;"" there's another film that's dying to be remade.) Flash forward to 2004, and film fans are experiencing a new wave of horror films. Following in the wake of self-aware, self-referential films like ""Scream"" (and its innumerable sequels and imitators), these new films take hip pop culture and blend it with shocks and copious amounts of gore. This remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" both follows that pattern and sets a path of its own.

Less satirical than the original, but less self-aware than other films, ""Dawn of the Dead"" gives the viewer plenty of scares and suspense, with only a threadbare plot to sustain the film. Basically, survivors of a worldwide plague that has turned people into flesh-hungry zombies huddle together in a gigantic mall, trying desperately to survive. That's the essence of the plot; there's nearly no logic or thought in the script, dialogue, or characterization. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames try hard, and give good performances (given the fact that they've got very little to work with in terms of a script). Most of the other characters fall under the heading of ""Just-Filling-Space-Until-I-Can-Be-Killed-In-A-Memorable-Manner."" In that sense, it reminds me of many 80s horror movies: No plot, no logic, just blood and gore. There's a satirical edge, to be sure, but much less so than Romero's version; listen, for example, to the awful Muzak playing at many points of the film. (Ironically, there's quite a bit of product placement going on in the film; perhaps the writers and producers felt that putting too much of an anti-consumer edge into the film would be a little hypocritical). A nice touch, however, is the omnipresent news coverage of the outbreak, reminding us of how much the media has come to dominate our lives. That's not so much satire as it is social commentary, and it's welcome in a film that's so bereft of subtext. Indeed, this film has little to recommend it in terms of plot or character motivation. So why would I give a mindless horror film four out of five stars?

Because ""Dawn of the Dead"" is all about horror and action, and in that regard, it definitely delivers the goods. There's plenty of action to go around: People killing zombies, zombies killing people, lots of shooting and hacking with axes, the mall gets trashed, and things blow up. A LOT. It's got more than the usual requisite amount of action; viewers won't be bored by the film, that's for sure. There's plenty of shocks and scares in the film; memorable scenes include a zombie baby (very unpleasant to watch; the director's cut extends this scene for a few more squeamish moments); one character is accidentally torn apart by a chainsaw on a bus; in fact, the entire bus chase was pretty good; and a cool segment accompanied by an acoustic version of ""Down with the Sickness."" This director's cut adds only a few new action segments; the rest are mostly filler (which deserved to stay on the cutting room floor). But some new scenes add necessary information, such as how they got into the mall in the first place (the theatrical cut was a little vague on this) or flesh out peripheral characters enough that they become something more than just cannon fodder. For those reasons, I recommend the director's cut over the theatrical version. It makes more sense, and the characters are easier to sympathize with.

Devotees of the original film may or may not like this remake. It lacks Romero's social commentary and sharp dialogue, but it has far more action and suspense than the original. How much you like this will depend greatly on what you are looking for. Fans of action may enjoy it more than those seeking an intelligent horror film along the lines of the original.

Not realizing what's going on they run up to her and she grabs the man's head and bites deep into his neck.

This little bit is just a taste of how horrific this movie really gets. But within the horror there still is humor.

And in yet another scene is a lounge version of Disturbed's Down With the Sickness.

The special features to this movie are great. (If you're wondering how I got to see them, it's because I work at a video store and get to see the movies the weekend before they come out.) Right now I'm watching the news reports, which only add to the chills of the movie. There's also Andy's last days which shows Andy talking about things over the weeks before he is turned into a zombie.

I highly recommend that anyone who loves scary movies should add this to their collection, this movie will definitely scare the living hell out of you.",1098489600,2,1307,4.326530612244898

horror movies have SUCKED over the past several years. in a world of crappy flicks like ""scream"" and ""i know what you did last summer"" and ""the grudge"", its nice to see a real balls out gory horror movie, that isn't geared towards 13 year old girls.

i saw the remake of ""texas chainsaw massacre"" and thought it was crap, it wasn't scary or gory and when this came out i figured ""here we go again"" and when i hear ving raimes and makah pfieier, or however you spell them, was in it i was like ""god, this movies gonna be lame"" but when i rented it last night and saw it.......i was surprised on how gory and creepy it was.

There were scenes in this movie that I had to turn my head because they were so graphic! I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the scene with the pregnant woman and newborn child was quite disturbing! I have NEVER seen anything quite so like this movie in my life. After watching this movie it is hard to get it out of your head. Some people remarked about the Zombies moving so fast, but believe me, that is what made this movie so intense!! The picture on the DVD was awesome, and the surround sound would have you jumping out of your seat! If you have a good home theater setup, then this movie really puts it to the test! I haven't even had a chance to check out the extras on the DVD, but I plan on doing so after I get a chance to get over this movie first. If you are into gory, Zombie movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, then you have to check this one out!! I thought I had seen it all, until I watched this one! Be warned!! Enjoy!!!

First off if something like this ever happened in Wisconsin we would have handled it alot better, At least 9 out of 10 homes have one or more shotguns/rifles, ok people this is a hunting state.  Second of all a sporting goods store in a mall would have at least 10 rifles on display so I don't see how these people could have had trouble finding weapons.  And you would be able to see alot more that one gun store from the roof of that mall, plus I'm not sure how many yacht clubs and far off islands we have.  Other than a few of the things that didn't make any sence in the movie and a few of the characters I thought this was a great movie, but they should have done a bit on Saturday Night Live about that one guy and his zombie girlfreind and baby.",1098057600,,873,4.058139534883721
2066515,4,B00027SIUK,"*a couple of minor spoilers below*

The unrated director's cut of Dawn of the Dead will definitely satisfy viewers who liked the theatrical version but possibly found it lacking in a couple of areas. First and foremost, there's more gore in several extended scenes. Some are quite a bit longer, with many more zombie ""deaths,"" and some have only an extra second or two, but these are the key seconds that usually show zombies getting their heads blown off. If you're the type to get this DVD, that's exactly what you want.

Second, a few of the plot points are explained better, which was key for me. In the theatrical version, I was confused as to exactly how Ana, Kenneth, and the rest actually get into the mall in the first place. Also, after they go through the sewers to get to Andy's shop, it wasn't clear how they got back into the sewers again without getting overrun by the zombie hordes. The director's cut fills in these plot holes completely, while throwing in a pair of impressive action sequences -- bonus! And a deleted scene (not part of the DVD movie, but one of the extras) shows the second group of survivors (with Matt Frewer) getting out of the back of their truck, which seems a little glossed over in the movie. That one isn't really a plot hole, but it's good to see the filmmakers didn't overlook it, and director Zack Snyder explains satisfactorily why he cut the scene in both versions. There are some other deleted/alternate scenes as well, all with optional commentary.

The movie commentary is pretty casual, with Snyder chatting with producer Eric Newman, basically doing the standard ""praise everybody"" thing. Not that the movie doesn't deserve praise, and they both express themselves in fun ways. Fortunately, intermixed with the ""this guy was awesome"" comments,  they reveal a lot of interesting factoids about the cast (including various zombie players), plot, and musical choices. However, I wanted them to talk about why they decided to have fast zombies instead of traditional slow ones, but they never do, aside from simply acknowledging that they took some dramatic license with various aspects of zombie lore.

The other extras are okay, though I found the ""Special Bulletin"" newscasts -- supposedly covering the growing zombie plague (eerily starring the recently deceased Richard Biggs) -- to be monumentally lame, especially compared to the topnotch fake news footage that's used in the actual film. Also, I looked high and low, but I couldn't find the theatrical trailer or teaser on the disc. That's certainly not a deal-breaker, but since they're so short, why wouldn't you throw them in? Just an oversight, I guess.

Still, this disc contains a markedly better version of the movie than you saw in theaters, and that's the reason to buy it. And that 5.1-channel sound -- yowza! Apartment-dwellers may want to turn down their subwoofers during the shooting and explosions. Everybody else -- duck!",1097971200,3,2945,4.915492957746479

2066524,5,B00027SIUK,"Well maybe not everything, but it was one of the best horror movies of late, as well as one of the best horror remakes.  Psycho fell a bit flat, not bad, but nothing special.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre was argued over many about how terrifying it was.  This one was a truly scary movie, dealing with several common fears; death, especially when they rise to consume the living, and the fear of disease.  It also deals with some more psychological ideals, as in how would survivors deal with what appears to be the end of the world.

The movie starts out simply enough, teasing you with ideas of what was going to happen.  Ana (Sarah Polley) is working late on her shift as a nurse.  There is mentioned that someone was brought in for a bite on the hand and the ambulances tear off before she leaves.  She and her husband are obviously very in love, and while taking a shower miss an emergency broadcast on the TV.  A little girl who seems injured wakes them from their slumber, but then savagely attacks and kills her husband like a feral animal.  While she is calling an EMT her husband dies, gets up, and starts attacking her in the same manner.  She manages to get to her car and escape out of her neighborhood.  But disaster is all around her, packs of people screaming wildly are running through the burbs, cars are racing through the streets crashing more often than not, etc......  She crashes after someone tries to take her car, and after waking up meets Kenneth(Ving Rhames) and another group of people looking for safety.  They go to the mall and board it up with a group of rednecks they found and other survivors and try to figure what to do next.

The first 10 minutes of this movie are just about perfect.  It was teasing with the horror, bringing up the tension until we finally see what we paid to see.  Then it goes full tilt until the car crash and the opening credits.  They show tidbits of what is going on through news pieces, and without telling you make it seem like society is collapsing, and now people are more concerned with survival than anything.  The zombies aren't slow moving ponderous(a fact that was argued over by horror fans), they are fast moving almost feral animals.  Society seems to rapidly collapse with extreme chaos, then the only thing that you see is the dead and the small group of survivors.  The survivors are what you would logically expect, a mixed up group of people; crazy rednecks, a yuppie, some kids, truckers, salesman, gangbanger, etc.....  They don't interact well, some of them are outright dangerous, and some are a little deranged.  They go from a point of fear to a point of decadence, society is gone so they can do pretty much whatever they want, no work, no bills, etc.....

The bad
The acting was a bit lopsided, and though there were more people than in the original, they didn't go into a lot of them with any sort of depth making them feel a bit too dimensional.  They also didn't explore the world around them as much, making it feel more claustrophobic.

The good
The movie has a fresh feeling to the pacing, starting out as an adrenaline shot then going to a psychological piece, to a survival at all costs ending.  The zombies are used well, never over done, or overused.  The makeup and FX are excellent, especially when you see the progression in one of the featurettes.  The plot was believable, and the character interactions interesting.  The extras were actually worthwhile, they took some effort in this.

All in all this is an excellent horror movie, and one of the better zombie movies of all time.",1096416000,2,3580,4.555555555555555

The action is unstoppable, the characters are good, acting is good, special effects are good, there aren't so much plot holes (altough they're inevitable in such a kind of movies...). Comparison with the previous movie will make no good,they're completely different things.

There is gore,no doubt about that. There are clichec characters, but the director does an amzing job of giving them some deepness with the time has has at his disposal. Also, director Snyder, a music video director, did not use blinding fast edition to disguise the bad movie he was shooting. No. He believed in the script, so he directed it properly.

I really enjoyed this movie. It had glued me in my seat, and I really cared for the characters, even if they were a dozen more than in the original movie.

Breathtaking. The sense of coming doom that slowly goes through your senses is somehting I've seldom felt in movies, the sense that, no matter what these guys do, they will die. The director passed this message slowly, with each passing sense.",1096329600,,1304,4.782222222222222
2066526,2,B00027SIUK,"It is now official. The age of subtlety, patience and intelligence in the horror industry is dead and, unfortunately, it won't be resurrected anytime soon. To view George Romero's 1978 masterwork ""Dawn of the Dead"" before watching the remake puts this case in point.

Romero's film, though seemingly clear-cut on the surface, was really an evocative, satirical sketch on all that had gone awry in America. While representing an assault on consumerism, as the zombies symbolize mindless, impulsive shoppers drawn to the place they most vividly recall in life (the mall), the film was also a moral condemnation of corporations and media outlets. Romero also addressed the significant concern of racism at the time.

In the astounding first seven minutes of the remake, set in apocalyptic pitch to Johnny Cash's number ""The Man Comes Around,"" it appears this film might outdo its predecessor. It doesn't. After hitting hard early, the film gradually tires and wilts in the later moments like Mike Tyson. Whereas the original film had a faultless blend of mordant humor and shock, the remake is wholly deficient. It simply comes up short in wit and quirkiness.

Accompanied by a bawdy electronic musical score by the Italian band Goblin, the original picture had no reservations in revealing cannibalistic acts with a sprig of silly. This was evident in one of my favorite scenes in which a looting biker deposited a quarter and slipped his arm into a sleeve to have his blood pressure tested. After fending off several zombies with a pistol discharge to the skull, he was soon overwhelmed and eaten alive. Moreover, his arm was torn from its socket and remained in the blood-pressure sleeve. Seconds later a beep-beep sounded, and his blood pressure registered as 0.0.

Furthermore, the viewer had the pleasure of becoming somewhat acquainted with the zombies. There was the Afro-sportin' Dr. J look-alike zombie, the perpetual on-the-go nurse zombie and my undead-of-preference, the exceptionally clever Hare Krishna zombie.

This characteristic is sorely lacking in the remake. Instead of becoming personalized, the zombies are depicted as a fleeting mass. This sort of presentation works well if the subjects are birds, but I'm not so sure about former human beings.

Speaking of fleeting, I guess zombies that creepily lurch about at a tortoise-like pace are taboo in the minds of the MTV generation. The demand these days calls for zombies that tirelessly sprint in search of living human flesh at speeds that would make Willie Mays Hayes envious.

Taking into consideration that these zombies are demonically super-charged, how is it physically possible that obese members of the undead can somehow run down an automobile? I mean, for heaven's sake, there's one scene where a badly bitten quarter-ton woman is hauled into the safety of the mall in a wheelbarrow, only to perish and become a feisty, running-on-all-cylinders flesh-craver. I don't get it.

With all else aside, the remake is extremely entertaining. Just be sure to downshift your mind into a passive gear beforehand.",1096243200,6,3084,5.166332665330661

However, judging solely on this movie, I must say this movie was better than I expected! The story is about a group of strangers, who come together after escaping zombies, and find sanctuary inside a shopping mall. The whole movie focuses on their survival from being infected by the zombies, and figuring out how to escape from all this.

The first thing that I liked about the movie was the fact that there were not zombies coming out some hiding place every two minutes and scaring you (that is, it wasn't too gory). The movie takes its own pace in building up the story and builds up the characters well. Furthermore, every scene is not horrifying that makes you jump off your seat, or makes you feel scared throughout the movie. True, some of the scenes are truly terrifying, but my point is that it also provides a lot of comic relief once in a while and actually makes you laugh at times. I have never seen that in a horror movie and found it a great idea. Throughout the movie, you laugh, get scared, become doubtful, feel sorry, get sick, and actually start rooting for the good guys! I did not feel this way (for `28 days later' or) for any other horror movie that I have recently seen. In the end, you feel satisfied as you didn't waste your money and time in watching a worthless movie.

The special effects and the direction of this movie are amazing. Zack Snyder did an awesome job for a debut as a director. The zombies look really gory and terrifying. The acting is nothing great, but not bad either. It is the type of acting you would expect from such a movie. Sarah Polly played well as Ana and so did Ving Rhames. The rest of the cast were pretty much ok, but added well to the film. On the whole, if you into movies like '28 days later', you will find this interesting.",1094860800,2,1944,4.337912087912088

That's why I decided I would use his review to do mine. After I read this, I knew I had to get in there and review too. Thanks Matt. You're a good man, or unintelligent one.

""What ticks me off isn't that this movie was re-made. That's really only a quarter of my anger. What really makes me mad (and I mean raging, running ZOMBIE mad) is that George Romero has been trying to get funding for years to make his fourth ""Dead"" film and this piece of junk is greenlighted. So, instead of seeing a less violent, well thought-out and BRAND NEW zombie picture, we get a hackneyed, burnt-out, steroid-injected remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" for the hip-hop generation???"" -Matt Perri (that idiot from Friends)

News for you Matt. They've been trying to get the remake funded since 1999. Romero's been trying to get his fourth piece of crap funded since 2001. So who's had a harder time? Not only that, but he also says this is for the hip-hop generation. Truthfully, I hate hip-hop. I hate rap. I hate music in general. I don't watch stupid MTV Generation movies. Like ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", or ""Torque"". Why? Because they look stupid.

They were talking all the way through the crappy ""House of the Dead"", and even the good ""Resident Evil"", but not this movie. Why? There were no teens in the theatre. Most teens don't like zombies.

""What plagues the Earth is not really explained at all."" - Matt Perri (that idiot from Friends)

Romero neve gave us an explanation. Why do these people need one?

""Anyway, the Nameless Virus takes over the Earth in about 11 minutes"" - Matt Perri (that idiot from friends)

Let's see. There were people being brought in during the evening. The next day, the world new it was happening, and people were dying by the hour. By the afternoon,  television stations were going off the air, and by night everything was getting overrun. They never said everyone was gone. They just said there was no more news, and no more shelters.

""Those younger viewers who have seen this movie are going to say some fun things like, ""This was just as good as '28 Days Later'"" or ""this was better than '28 Days Later'"" or even something that will make you so happy that you will want to put a bullet in your head, like, ""fast-moving zombies are really scary!!!"""" - Matt Perri ( that idiot from Friends)

You got the just as good part wrong, but the better than was just right. By the way, fast zombies are scarier than slow zombies.

""Zombies are slow. They move slow. They always have moved slow. Numbers were their strong-suit. You moved wrong, did something stupid, you were dinner. You made a mistake and put yourself in a corner, you were dinner. And again, they moved slow. And you were surrounded. You saw death coming and you couldn't do anything about it. THAT was scary. Everything these days must be fast, including horror films. The killer in ""Scream"" was fast. The zombies in ""Resident Evil"" were fast. The infected in ""28 Days Later"" were fast...and that brings me to my point:"" -Matt Perri (that idiot from Friends)

Numbers are still the strong-suit in the remake. That's why they could not just run outside. Too many of them. He says if you're surrounded, then you're dinner.  I say run through them. They're weak, right? You should have no problem. Yet, another guy ( I will not call him an idiot) says that ""Resident Evil"" had fast zombies. They were not.

""This movie sucks. This movie is NOT ""28 Days Later"", nor is it BETTER than that movie, nor is it just as good. It doesn't even deserve to be called ""Dawn of the Dead"". Call us zombie fans ""nerds"" but there's one factor that makes this movie needless, unintelligent, unwatchable sludge: those crazy, monsters who should be less obssessed with consuming human flesh and more concerned with training for next year's Olympic games. Call us zombie fans ""movie snobs"", but the reason why ""28 Days Later"" had those angry, hyped-up, caffeinated...well, I hesitate to even refer to them as ""zombies"", so I will call them infected humans, since that's what they were...the only reason they could move like they did was because, they weren't DEAD, they were living people infected by a virus that stimulated the part of the brain that caused anger and unnatural rage. That makes any comparison from ""Dawn of the Dead"" to ""28 Days"" null and void. If you're dead and you come back to life, you won't be running for the Jamaican relay team, you'll be carrying your almost disembodied leg as you wander to the closest thing that resembles your lunch: a human being. If you have been infected by a virus and you die and come back to life, you won't be towards a living soul like a baserunner coming around third and heading for home plate. You'll be attempting to outrun the snail that's trying to break for the same patch of lawn as you are. You are a zombie. You move SLOW. That's zombie law. You can't run like the Six-Million Dollar Man. You can't jam around a corner like a $35,000 BMW. You CAN'T. You will move a foot every three or four seconds."" - Matt Perri (that idiot from Friends)

Thank you for admitting that this is not 28 Days Later. It never was, nor did it ever claim to be, but yes, it's better, and yes it deserved to be called ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Thank you for also mentioning that the creatures in 28 Crappy Days Later were not dead. There's another reason why this is not a rip-off. Then he says the zombies would not run, which brings me to the conclusion that he knows everything about a zombie. Every little detail. By the way, how does anybody know what a zombie is like? I've never seen one, but clearly someone out there must have seen one to know so much about them. Come on Matt! Where's your proof. Also, zombies don't have laws. I can do a zombie movie the way I want to. How does he know if I were a zombie I would move a foot every three of four seconds? Hell, look at the first zombie in Romero's crappy ""Night of the Living Dead"". He was moving fast. Wasn't he?

""Forgiving all that I have given you above, I should probably mention that Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley head up a cast of cliched characters which include The Black Guy, The Pregnant Girl with the Zombie Baby (yes, the Zombie Baby), The Morally Converted Security Guard, The Nurse, The Mean Guy, The Sweet Doggie, and more. And it all takes place at the mall where the suvivors have made their new home. Of course, zombies are headed to the mall. Why? Good question. In the original, there was still a microscopic part of the zombies that recognized it as a place to mecca. It was a brilliant metaphor that Romero put on us: we're all just a bunch of dumb, brain-dead, culture-and-fad-obssessed zombies. The Mall was just as much a character as the rest of the other characters. The zombies in this film seem more concerned with just death and destruction and eating more to further their cause...nice try at a metaphor...but it doesn't work."" -Matt Perri (that idiot from friends.

Basically everything's a clich these days. Shaun of the Dead was a clich. The mum loving brit. The girlfriend that doesn't want to be with star anymore, and wants a better life. The guy who hates the mum loving brit. The best friend that dies. It's all clich. As you can see. This is another person that likes to brag about how great a metaphor Romero put in this film, even though he would not have known, had he not been told by another source. Romero also portrays ""consumerism"" inaccurately. ""Consumerism"" involves the consumption of goods. The zombies didn't want the goods, they wanted the place.  Also, ""consumerism"" was something that was beginning in those times, which refers to the title, ""Dawn of the Dead"".  It would be silly to do a movie based in modern times, but do something that was happening back in the seventies. Hell, that would be like bringing racism back to the film. Hahahahahaha!!! Mall? A character? The mall is just a building given a funny name. Always has been always will be.

""If anything, Romero's point still stands strong today. Want proof?
We all flocked like zombies to this stinkbomb, didn't we?
--Matt"" - Matt Perri (that idiot from Friends)

Romero does not stand strong. He's old, pathetic, and a crack-head. I agree with Zack Snyder. The only people who did not want this movie to be made and asked him why he was remaking a ""classic"" and calling it stupid before it even came out were all old, pot-smoking crack-heads. Yep. There's the quote I used in my ""Night of the Living Dead review. By the way Matt. You flocked like a bird to the movie. I drove. Also, it proved to the world that it wasn't a stink bomb like Romero's film.",1094428800,,9329,4.516893894487255
2066532,5,B00027SIUK,"Lots of people will try and compare this one to the original, or tell you that they didn't like the ending, and lots of other stuff.

 You can't blame their judgements because Dawn of the Dead IS a classic of modern horror.

But i'll give it to you straight: if you have watched the original to the point where you can actually tell the difference between the European and American cuts blindfolded, but you really want to be messed up by some zombie horror, then wacth this movie. Watch up until the opening credits. If you aren't just a little messed up in the first ten minutes,  then you ain't really ascared of zombies!

Alright, go get your copy!",1093910400,,652,4.445378151260504
2066533,4,B00027SIUK,"I don't know about the hypocrites who say you should never remake a classic and those who say all remakes suck; but I enjoyed this film a lot.  In my opinion, the original movie was actually pathetic.  Very pathetic, but still enjoyable.  This remake I thought was very cool.  It made me (and my friend) jump a few times.  But I still don't consider this to be a fabulous horror film.  This film is very under-rated, where as the original was very over-rated.  The films gore is great and truly deserves its R rating.  But there were a few things about the film I didn't like.  One would be the pregnancy part; the pregnant woman who turns into a zombie's husband is an idiot.  Simply put, at first he was a normal guy but then, I just wanted to kill him, which may have been the point.  Another would be the fact that we only see the National Guard fighting the zombies.  Now my response to this attack of FLESH tearing creatures would be rather simple.  BRING IN THE TANKS!!!  But then again this is a movie, so everything can't be perfect.  And they never explain why the zombies come back from the dead.  I know why, but for those who haven't seen any in the series, they wouldn't have a clue.

 In the original the remaining survivors fly out of the mall in a helicopter and accomplishing that is WAY too easy for them.  In the original the zombie's were just discolored people who didn't have any visible bit marks on them, like they were fresh out of the morgue.  In the original the zombies walked too slowly and you could easily run past them.  In the original there were only four people and a bunch of bikers.  In the original it was 1979 and malls were new.  In the original we see a Harri Krishna zombie which was hilarious.  In the original we only see 1 or 2 very gory scenes, everything else is unimpressive.

 In the remake the people escape the mall via Bus and accomplishing this is very difficult, not easy.  In the remake, almost all zombies have some visible wound on them, which makes the story more accurate.  In this version they run and rather well, not corny lookin' or anything.  In this version there a re a lot of people, it starts out with 5, and then turns 8 and then a truck with roughly 8 more people come.  The gore in this movie is obviously really good and isn't for the weak, but it's nothing like Dead Alive or The Evil Dead.  In the remake there is a new character that owns a gun shop across from the mall and communicates by writing things on signs and is very humorous.

I enjoyed this film a lot more then the original, which I feel is pale in comparison.  This version even includes a chainsaw!  And like the original, it has some comic relief every once in a while.  This movie is HIGHLY UNDER RATED!!!  Even if you didn't like it, it's still better than house of the dead.",1093910400,5,2819,4.312977099236641
2066534,5,B00027SIUK,"""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" is a great movie. Unlike the original.

What I find interesting is the people that say this movie is nothing more than a rip off of that crappy movie ""28 Days Later"". I found that the only thing ""Dawn of the Dead 2004"" and ""28 Days Later"" had in common was fast zombies.

There are a lot of hardcore fans of the original who say that it is not as good as the original. They say it's a good movie, just not as good as the original. I can respect that, but then there are those fans who say the remake was the worst thing they've ever seen and the original was the best thing they've ever seen. I can't respect that.

The opening of the original was nothing more than a group of people shouting and screaming in a news studio. It's completely unorgized (the direction) and stupid. However, the remake was organized and introduced our main female lead. Unlike the original, which was nothing but a loud mess.

The remake takes the zombie a little more seriously. Even though they do play ""Where's Waldo"" with the zombies they don't show them acting stupid, or tripping over things, or getting confused by an esculator. The zombies are more vicious and deadly than those in the original, and those in ""28 Days Later"", which really can't be considered a zombie film.

The remake had a plausible way of the zombies getting in, which was fighting their way in, but the original had a stupid way. A biker gang decides to rob the mall and steal all the money so they can be rich, meanwhile the zombies walk in. That's great writing.

The original fails to keep the audience entered because it is nothing more than mindless, idiotic chatter for two hours, but the remake keeps the audience entertained by throwing in a few jokes every once in a while. The remake also had a great director. He had some amazing shots in the film. The shot at the beginning where the viewers can see cars driving down the street at a hundred miles per hour, and buildings burning, and a helicopter burning. He had another great shot at the end where the bus blew up and the viewers can see all the zombies running towards it while it blew up.

The remake made it more interesting by throwing more characters into the mall. The original kept the same four idiots throughout the movie, and they all just got boring. By the end of the original, I was hoping they would all die, but they didn't. However, in the remake, I was hoping some people would live. Steve, Michael, Andy, and the Redneck.

The original has fans that can't stop talking about the great gore. Compared to the remake, the gore is just pathetic. It looks like pink candle wax. The original tried to be very gory when they ripped some people open, but it's very cheesy and unrealistic. The remake had gore that looked real. The blood was actually red. Even without ripping people open, it still had better gore.

People look at the dog scene when he's walking across the parking lot and say ""that's stupid. Why aren't the zombies eating the dog?"" In the original ""Dawn"" and ""Night"", I saw them backing away from fire. Now I say, ""That's stupid. they wouldn't be afraid of fire."" Romero never told us why they were afraid of fire. They just are.

""Some kind of instinct. Memory. What they used to do. This was an important place in their lives."" I, myself, don't consider malls important places. Romero attempted to tackle consumerism with this, but failed. Then the remake came along and gave us the proper explanation of why the zombies come to the mall. ""Memory? Instinct? Maybe they're coming for us."" Thanks Ving. They were coming for the people. They didn't want the mall. Zombies wanting a building and not people? Now that's just stupid.

So the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead 1978"" is much better than the original. In fact, it's the best movie ever made, and it is low budget, not high like people have been telling me.",1093564800,6,3885,4.4886685552407934
2066538,2,B00027SIUK,"It's been a frenzy of remakes in the last 2-3 years and with almost no exception the results ranged from laughable to disappointing.

  ""Dawn of the Dead"" is not as bad as i expected it to be but it surely isn't good either. What it lacks, as many others pointed out, is character development. Where the original had this gripping way of keeping the viewer involved this one is like a flashy big MTV video with the inevitable non-substance.

  Worse than that, it lacks totally on the originality level:

-it completely rips off the ""28 days later"" flick which by the way (apart of the ending) was great. It rips off its editing technique, the cuts, the pace, basically it looks more like a remake of that film than that of G.Romero's.

  Another problem is that the story is so underdeveloped and so inconsistent that even if you want , in good faith, to ignore the inconsistencies you simply can't. Zombies that are supposed to be mindless suddenly in certain scenes have a plan and sneak up on the protagonists. In another scene we see helicopters flying about and one of the main characters informs us repeatedly that the airforce is still at large. If so, why in the world cant the air force do the very same thing that the ""survivors"" are doing (blast the zombies to kingdom come) is beyond me, and in any case not explained.

  The most striking thing is basically that everybody in the film is mindless. It's obvious that it was made for mass consumption and it has zilch of a chance to ever attain the cult following of the original.

  As one other reviewer said, Romero's film had everything, gore, commentary, a consistent plot, etc..This one was strictly business.",1093305600,8,1677,4.614864864864865

For those who have not seen this movie, get ready and PLEASE make sure there are no kids around as this movie has nothing for kids or the faint of heart. It is absolutely intense from the get go.

2066541,5,B00027SIUK,"I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.

While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.

Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.

I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.

First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.

DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.

The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardises the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.

There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them `in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.

Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the `fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say `crikey!' Yes, the `turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.

I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.

This new Directors Cut DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.

Filmed in Super-35 the DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound.

If you immerse yourself in the film and believe that this is really happening then you will not be disappointed. Did Sara's head really hit the shower wall that hard? Is there really someone who would behave like Steve in this type of crisis? How did the little girl at the beginning become a zombie? What the hell is wrong with Mehki? Is he the most stupidiest guy in the history of movies? These were the questions I had after leaving the theater. The zombies have evolved with the ""28 Days Later"" like ability to run you down and eat you alive now. No more shuffling around like their ankles are tied together. There were some parts of the movie that truly took my breath away: the initial scenes with Sara escaping from the house, the mission to Andy's gun shop plus the return to the mall was one of the wildest rides I've had in a while. It was a lot like the whole scene in Van Helsing with Jackman and the three vamps, and the entire battle he had with them in the town square. These type of scenes really make a film woth seeing since after it's all over, you just hear a lot of people exhaling, and adjusting themselves in their seats, and trying to relax after such an action packed sequence. However, nothing affected me more than the character of Michael. This guy had me on his side from the beginning with his thoughtfulness, level headedness, and all around nice guy attitude. When he told Norma ""well done"", I just shook my head at how human he was. He was the heart and soul of the outfit, and when he chose to go outside to help the people in the truck it showed a level of caring for your fellow man that I have to say touched me deeply. It sounds like bull but I mean it. He was just a good guy. I liked C.J. too, but he was the guy you had to hate until Steve showed up. C.J. didn't behave like I thought he would when things broke down, and when he was in the sewer during the escape back to the mall, I had to admit I admired him for not just leaving Tucker to his doom. The escape from the mall was great too. I just loved this movie. The director did a good job of running your heat out of your chest with suspense, then giving you a few minutes to catch your breath, then running you ragged again. I'm buying this without question.

This new director's cut should make an already classic in the making horror-film into something even better. Zack Snyder did Romero proud with the film he created and made fans of the zombie-film subgenre howl with delight.

 Where Romero used his sequel to his other classic horror film, Night of the Living Dead, as a visual canvas to create an essay on the societal, political and philisophical path humanity was careening towards during the late 70's and early 80's, Snyder just decided to make the best undead-apocalyptic film he could make. This film has some very disturbing images of how a world would look like when faced with an event with ""apocalypse"" written in bold. The way some of the scenes were shot in cinema verite style looks like some of the news footage they show on tv dealing with riots and realtime battle footage on the ground.

 From the first five minutes it kicked me and most of the audience in the gut and doesn't let up. This all happens before the opening credits even come on. I knew Dawn of the Dead was in good hands when Snyder used Johnny Cash's The Man Around The Corner as the opening credits track. The Man in Black's distinctive voice playing over scenes of the world trying to comprehend the sudden rise of the dead to feastt on those still living.

 Even the humor that was sprinkled throughout the film had a morbid, twisted, sick angle to them. Those who have seen the original Dawn of the Dead will see some of the original actors doing cameos that fit well into the film. But it wasn't just gore and humor. There was alot of humanity in this film. I guess when one thinks they may be the only living people left on earth, sometimes living just to survive may not be enough.

 It doesn't mean that this film is lacking in blood and brain-matter. The gorefactor in this film is high, but it wasn't gore for the sake of having gore. This film's basic premise is of the recently dead coming back to life to attack and devour the living around them. I don't think a film with this premise can escape showing a living human being being ripped apart and devoured by a mob of putrefying and hungry zombies. They've actually had to cut back on the gore to get an R-rating for the film. I'm not sure what they cut out, but they skirted the realm of receiving an NC-17. This film ups the standard upon which make-up effects will be set to. They didn't skimp on showing what a bullet and/or a spray of 12-gauge buckshot would do to a human head.

 The acting, for a horror film, was good enough that you will care what happens to the survivors. Sarah Polley and Mekhi Phifer are two who had stand-out performances. Ving Rhames was his solid, dependable self. But the two actors who stuck in my mind were Jake Weber's Michael and Ty Burrell's Steve. Weber's Michael was like an everyman --- a calming and levelheaded presence in a world that is anything but. Burrell's Steve had every line which broke the tension and horror, giving the audience a chance to laugh and catch its breath.

 If there was a flaw in the film it would be in the uneven feel of the script dialogue. A majority of the dialogue is good, but some weak lines are heard here and there throughout the film. And certain horror conventions and cliches are used, but not too much to turn the film into a Scream-like film that winks and shows the audience how clever the script is.

 For those who have seen the original Dawn of the Dead and have been trying to find a reason to hate this remake, I say that if you give this film a chance and watch it on its own terms then it will surprise and entertain. Not better than the original but it succeeds in giving this subgenre of the horror field a lifegiving boost. 28 Days Later was a tease of a horror film compared to this remake.

 I highly recommend this film to horror aficionados and to film lovers. It may not be Kubrick, Fellini, or Kurosawa, but it doesn't set out to be. It just tries to scare and disturb you.",1091404800,13,4102,4.391820580474934

 Well... as a longtime zombie fan, I must say that I felt worried when I heard they were going to ramake one of the best horror films ever made. But after reading about it and watching it, I understood this film was NOT a basic, simple remake... it was a ""reenvisionment"".

 They took the original premisse and worked a new movie into it. ...Simple as that. In this way, I think no ""Dawn of the Dead"" fan should feel angry about ""new guys touching the classic film"".

 This NEW ""DOTD"" is a completely new film with all the budget, effects and ideas the 21st century can afford (today, this film can do many things it was not allowed 25 years ago!). Like me, the real fans will still feel confortable enough with some references the screenwriter threw in just for our amusement (can you spot them all??).

 The premisse is known... It appears that America is turned overnight by a plague os zombies... we see it happens (in one of the best horror film opennings ever made!!!) almost step by step until a group of people barricade themselves inside a shopping mall.

 Having said this, I have to admit I cannot choose between the two films (as many people will try to do) because they are so different in so many ways........ anyway... I do believe the simple existence of this ""remake"" is a great homage to the original film which stays at the cathedral it belongs. Thus, this new version will surelly attract a whole new legion of fans who did not see the original. In fact, it will bring a new (comercial) life to the original - as the Anchor Bay new dvd proves it.

 Now, about the film....

 I like it very much. To me, it is better than RESIDENT EVIL (which I liked very much) and better than 28 DAYS LATER (whose 30 last minutes I hated). Mr. Snyder seems to have a strong eye and a great sense of composition. His directing seems firm and sure. Many people may not know, but hes comes from advertising films and I sure noticed his strong sense of pacing.

 I was also afraid this film would have an ""all-too-beautiful"" advertising look. Well, it doesn't. It looks real and well situated.

 The casting seemed also like a good choice. While there are so much more characters than the original film, the chemistry between them, the plots and their backstories are nicely interlaced. I really liked these characters.

 The major plot news is the fact that this film gives a lot of attention to the sense of confusion the characters go into as they witness the ""dawn of the dead""... and its massive impact on society - in this sense, the first 20 minutes of this film are some of the best horror-film setups I have ever seen. Yes, it has lots of scarry moments and you should enjoy every one of them!!

 Need I say the makeup is over-the-top studio quality?

 Anyway, I think this film is a terrific horror film. It is fun, scarry, fast, loud... all in the right portions. It should be seen without prejudice. Obviously, the film has a few details I did not like (which I don't think I should discuss here... ok, I will... I thought the baby zombie was dull!!!), but I still think this to be a winning project. I hope it film is a huge success and I hope finally Mr. Romero is given the green light to his project.

 The director's cut does not add too much to the film. The changes I noticed are very discreet... a few more short scenes. I recomend it simply bacause in the case of a good film such as this, why not stay with it 10 more minutes?

 More extras?

 I loved the news covering the zombie outbreak. They DO look real enough to make you wonder. The documentaries on makeup and f/x are also fine. In short, this is an exemple of good extras and the right way to make a DVD.

I watched the original the other day, and it seriously needs a facelift in today's time. To be fair, the first Dawn of the Dead is a classic during it's time, and is so innovative.

I really like the openning of the movie. It looks so real when Sarah escaped from her house, and saw her neighbors being chased by zombies, you feel like it can really happen. The reality TV touch is just incredible.

2066559,2,B00027SIUK,"Okay, when you're remaking a movie satirical to consumerism what's the first thing you do? Hire a director whose only experience is commercials. That's like getting Michael Moore to direct 'Red Dawn'. Now, I don't mind a dumb horror movie ever so often but can't Hollywood have a dumb horror movie that doesn't smack a good original in the face and desecrate everything good about the movie in question?
Apparently not. Zack Snyder's 'remaginging' or 'reconceptualizing'a good movie for a quick cash in scares me more than his wretched movie did. Lets break the problems down piecemeal...
PROBLEM 1:
  Too many characters. The original got it right when it spent time on only 4 characters rather than waste screentime on morons I don't care about that are going to die soon anyway. You could actually connect with the original's 4 (Peter, Roger, Flyboy, and Francine. See, I know the names and I've only seen the movie 2 or 3 times.) But when someone dies in the remake I don't even know or care who they were half the time. Remember when those 2 people get chainsawed to death in the bus, I'd probably have to watch it again to find out who the hell they were. For awhile I thought the rich guy was having sex with the nurse but it turns out its some other blond. Also, the characters aren't characters; they're types. The rich jackass is a prime example. Instead of developing him he's just an a-hole and instead of developing others they're just considered the 'good guys.' The cast could've easily been shaved down to 6 or 8, but I guess fanboys want to salivate over more deaths and more carnage despite any real relevance to any story.
PROBLEM 2: Nothing new to the table. Snyder nixed the ""Masque of the Red Death""concept but for what? All his movie is about are people trapped somewhere who want to escape elsewhere. Wow, that's original. Nothing new comes to the premise, not even within the zombie subgenre. Even the pregnant mother was ripped off from Dead Alive and the fast zombies copied from 28 days later.
PROBLEM 3: Logical loopholes. How come in this post-modern time haven't people in zombie movies not seen or heard of a zombie? The logic behind most of the characters is to forward the plot and for no other reason. Why did that girl go through a horde of zombies to rescue a dog? Why did the zombies just happen to be near the mall hanging out (Its explained in the original but not this one)? Why did the security guard kill himself on the bus when he could've easily fought his way out? The characters make the dumbest decisions anyone else would've avoided.

I mean cheesy in an affectionate way because we have to remember this time period where violence in film was not normal and in glorious gory digital details. It was new then and budgets were tight and makeup technology was being pioneered by Savini.
This remake is visually stunning and the excitement of the 'fast zombie' cannot be denied regardless of your loyalty to Romero. I do think more character development seemed a bit short the first (and only) time I saw this film.
Zack Synder stands on the shoulders of Romero and I do think he has made an awesome film that does the genre true justice.

2066563,4,B00027SIUK,"Well, i will admit that this movie is awesome but i still prefer the original to this one because of what the original did to me when i was a kid...SCARED ME TO DEATH!!
Being 28 now, and seeing how the film industry has evolved along with everything else with their special effects, editing and bigger budgets, any remake or movie will look better than what was released 20 years ago.
Of course i said look better but not made better!
Getting back to the movie, i enjoyed it, the acting was decent and the zombies looked good, in some cases too good! As for the story, it changed alot besides for the location (a shopping mall) where all the action took place in.
For everyone that didn't see the 2004 version but saw the original, here are some changes...
1-Original starts off in a newsroom telling the public about the living coming back from the dead...the remake starts off in a hospital where they're treating a patient with a bite, then all hell breaks loose in the first ten minutes. (the best opening for a horror film that i've seen in a long time!)
2-No army type guys fighting off zombies in the remake, just regular people like you and me doing all the dirty work!
3-Lots of blood in this one, wins hands down in that department compared to the original!
4-They must have put steroids in the ground, these 2004 zombies are faster then ever (28 days later fast!), the original movie features the slowest zombies ever put on screen!
5-Was that Tom savini in the remake playing a news reporter on TV? Yes, very small part compared to the original where he played a crazy rough and tough biker.
...let's just stop there, they are so many differences in these two films but that's what the director wanted, keep it true to the original but give it that 2000 feel to it which i had no problem with..except for the fact that it did remind me alot of ""28 days later"" which the director had to have got some inspiration from.
All in all, great zombie film, but if your looking for a real ""old school"" horror film, check out Romero's version. Then you can decide for yourself!

2066565,5,B00027SIUK,"I normally don't write reviews for these things, but it seems that many of the other reviews missed something important... but I will get to that later.
Romero's Dawn was a classic, and I was not at all sure the remake would be worthwhile, but I was happily surprised.  Ramping up the zombies to a Resident Evil type speed was a stretch for me, but it works in the context of this new story.  Like TCM, this was not just a remake but a rewrite, the only way it could have worked.  This movie was done well enough to keep original Dawn fans happy and bring a new legion of zombie lovers into the fold.  Sure, some of the dialogue was cheese, but its a horror movie for god's sake!  What do you expect?  (And its not like other popular genre's are devoid of cheese.)
The characters were well-defined, even if some were merely caricatures of societal elements.  The special effects were top-notch, and the frenzied zombies gave a sense of imminent danger rather than the forboding sense of doom from the original.
For all those who complained about the ending... you obviously left the theater too soon.  In recent years, many movies have delighted in putting extras in the credits... in this movie, if you left when the credits began to roll... well, don't make that foolish mistake again.

2066567,3,B00027SIUK,"This is the 2nd movie review I've ever written, as I usually review music. You've all seen the original Dawn of the Dead (if you haven't stop looking here and buy the 1st one), and I'm pretty sure most of you avid movie fans have seen the fantastic 28 Days Later, another 'zombie' flick.
If you've seen the original Dawn of the Dead, you would remember:
""They're after us. They know we're still in here.""
""They're after the place. They don't know why, they just remember....remember that they want to be in here""
""What are they?""
""They're us that's all. There's no more room in hell""
Then proceeds an explanation of what's going on and how his Voodoo grandfather predicted that one day, when there was no more room in Hell, the dead would walk the Earth. In the movie, there was a massive gaping hole in the plot here. This conversation never took place and no one offered any explanations. Those classic quotes I just repeated were replaced with a dismal ""When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth.""
Also there were many other things that ticked me off about this movie. Since when are there sex scenes in horror movies? The first one was uncalled for but the 2nd one.... I guess it was just portraying people going back to their basic instincts and just doing whatever with what could be the last hours of their lives, so I guess I can understand a reason for that, it helps create an atmosphere (I was thinking more apocalyptic than erotic!). Some of the acting was terrible, some of it was fantastic, the guy who gets bitten and stays behind at the end, the merciless security guard, Mekhi Phifer (im not sure how to spell it) and the black cop were very well done, whereas the smart a$$ who owned the boat (someone would never have an attitude like that in times like those!) and the nurse who I suppose you could call the main character wasn't acted very well at all.
The last thing I have to complain about is that this movie is EXACTLY a carbon copy of 28 Days Later. It is so similar that you could say that that it's the same movie set in a different area with different people. The zombies, again, are fast and relatively intelligent (for zombies), not at all zombie-like other than in appearance, which may I say, they looked fantastic. In 28 Days Later, the 'zombies' were not zombies at all, they were infected humans that craved blood. That's all. And to you people who say that there's no rule against zombies being fast.... Zombies are dead. They are reanimated for various reasons in movies (not that this movie has one (plot-hole)), sometimes by Necromancers, sometimes, they're just direct descendants from Hell, but it don't matter, they are all braindead, they are barely materialistic in the form that it is not their will binding them to the Earth and that particular dimension. My last complaint (again!) is that there was no real ending to the movie, they just ride off, finishing abruptly, leaving you, not suspended but annoyed at what was going to happen next. Don't read any of this if you haven't seen the movie if you don't want it spoiled: After they rode off in the boat, what if the island population was infected? What if they didn't eventually find an island? I'd rather a bad ending than no ending!
All the bad out the way, you may wonder how on Earth I came to give this 3 stars instead of 1, this movie had a fairly apocalyptic image, which is the only thing in horror movies that affects me in the form of, not really fear, but a damning realisation that maybe one day these scenarios may be true, the movie does well to put you in the shoes of the characters. In other words, it had a great atmosphere. Ever since I watched the movie On the Beach ( i think that's what it is), an Australian tele-movie about the world's end due to a nuclear war between Korea (not too sure, somewhere in Asia) and America. This was a damning movie, in the end, the whole population died out and with all the nuclear weapon troubles, Global Warming and droughts (not really a world-ender but nasty anyway!) it's only too obvious that movies like The Day After Tomorrow are going to strike a nerve in some people, especially the movies based on fact.
Another few compliments, I loved the part where Andy was sniping famous zombies such as Jay Leno. I also thought the zombie-baby was a great idea, I think that part put something more in the movie. The bus part was AWESOME as well. I just love the part where they throw the propane cylinder to the zombies and blow up hundreds of the monsters. The gore was fair in this movie as well.
Very flawed but nonetheless enjoyable. A great night out, don't bother buying the DVD, it's not the kind of thing you're going to watch several times. If you want to go to the movies, there are better movies out right now other than this, but by no means stay away from it. If you liked 28 Days Later, you'll love this, if you've seen the original Dawn of the Dead, you may hate this, you may like it, depends on how religiously you hold the first movie.",1089072000,2,5035,4.456121343445287

2066578,5,B00027SIUK,"........is because they've only been dead for a day and their bodies haven't stiffened up completely yet.  In the original Dawn of the Dead, zombies had already taken over by the beginning of the movie.  The remake, however, shows us the apocalypse from the very beginning.  But regardless, zombies that run are far more terrifying and I'm glad the change was made for this movie.
I remember when I first heard of the production of this movie, I, like so many others, had already condemned this to be one of the worst movies of the year.  After all, why do a zombie remake?  All zombie movies are essentially the same; zombies take over, a group of survivors barricade themselves in some sort of shelter, most end up dying, a few survive.  Logic persists that a filmmaker should just do another movie rather than dishonor a classic.  Stephen King wrote an interesting article in Entertainment Weekly regarding the Dawn of the Dead remake.  He wrote that the original was so shocking because it pushed the limits of what can be shown on film.  There was a classic scene, in particular, were a terrified woman runs into the arms of her husband near the beginning of the film.  Expecting to be safe from the army of zombies, she then looks up towards his face only to find his expression cold and lifeless.  He then takes a huge chunk out of her shoulder.  At the time, that was going too far, Stephen King writes.  Nowadays, that's no big deal.  How could the remake push the envelope like the original did?  Most of time, studios won't even try.  They'd rather do a lackluster job and cash in on the name.  I'm happy to say that the Dawn of the Dead remake has all the elements that made the original so magnificient, as well as pushes the envelope far beyond what any of us expected.  That particular scene in the original....now replaced with an eight year old girl, biting into her bewildered father's neck as blood shoots out in streams.  An obvious homage to the classic scene in the original, but improving upon it.  But it only begins there, this entire movie is non-stop zombie destruction.  Some of the most creative uses of gore I've ever seen in a movie.  Zombies running down the street get their heads splattered in real time with no editing away and then back to the zombie.  A survivor accidently getting sawed in half by a clumsy ally with a chainsaw.  A zombie woman giving birth to a zombie baby and much, much more.  In my humble opinion, this surpasses the original in every single aspect imaginable.  Not only should remakes be this good, but ALL horror movies should be done like this.  This, people, is how it's done.",1088208000,5,2639,4.571428571428571
2066579,4,B00027SIUK,"Earlier comments criticize that zombies can't run, and that dead people will stiffen to the point that they're bodies would never allow that type of activity. If I remember correctly, they didn't explain the deaths like the original did. Just like 28 days later, the zombification was explained as a viral infection. (Cue the bad song lyric ""get down with the sickness""). Works for me. But it makes you wonder why they kept the title ""Dawn of the Dead"". Maybe they mean it in a metaphorical sense. Or maybe it's just marketing. By the way, I thought this move was very scary. Even though some of the subplots were dumb and characters were cheesy.",1088121600,,646,4.675438596491228
2066580,2,B00027SIUK,"Okay, let me make one thing clear at the outset: I am NOT against this story's concept. This is fiction, and that's totally cool with me.
However, what happened to development of the story? We have the main character, a nurse played by Sarah Polley, coming home from work one evening where she has a quick chat with her neighbour's daughter who's cycling across the street. Following that, she enters her home and proceeds to make out with her husband before falling asleep. Early next morning, her husband is awakened by the neighbour's kid who then bite's a chunk out the man's neck because overnight she's turned into a zombie.
So far so good, and once again, I have no issue with the concept because this is good old fashioned fiction.
To cut a long story short, Sarah Polley's character and the other main characters meet at a place called the Crossroads Mall and this is where the storyline goes from being dark and foreboding to just plain stupid.
Suddenly the characters, who WERE totally resentful of each other, start their shagfest while very conveniently forgetting that there are about a hundred thousand zombies outside the shopping mall waiting to EAT them. Sarah Polley's character also develops a romantic allure for another male character and that's fair... After all, wouldn't you be just as willing to move on if your partner had met with such a gory demise just 24 hours ago????
Nevertheless, the horror aspect of this film does take the cake. The amount of blood and gore is enough to make a butcher feel homesick - wait for the scene detailing the accident with the chainsaw to see what I mean.
Full credit must also be given to the formulation of this film's trailer. The atmospheric tension it delivers was enough to get me to spin some BS excuse and leave work early today to watch the movie!
However, the terror aspect is just not there and if that's what you're going to watch this film for then you're going to be disappointed.
At the end of the day, if you want to watch a great modern remake of the whole zombie concept, 28 Days Later is the film to see.",1088121600,3,2085,4.592493297587131
2066581,4,B00027SIUK,"I love Zombie movies. I even watch those aweful Italian zombie flicks in an attempt to see all in existance. If there's one thing I hate more than a zombie that knows how fly and land a plaine (City of the Dead), or fire a gun (Day of the Dead) it's a zombie that can run. As you probably know, this film is filled with sprinting zombies. Top that with the fact the original Dawn of the Dead is simply one of the greatest horror works of art to ever be made and you'd think I hate this film more than just about anything. But I loved it. Despite what I happen to hate most about every single new zombie movie being a very prevelent theme I still loved it. This movie did a great job of basically just satisfiying the little zombie hunter inside of me and hopefully it will satisfy yours. My third time seeing it in the theater was with a friend who hates horror movies and for the next three days he was doing nothing but asking about zombie movies, and the whole mythology that accopmanies them. \
Also I should say 28 Days Later, while it was great is not a zombie movie. I'm sick of hearing people say that. If they're not undead they're not zombies (though I can't deny the common themes).
Dawn of the Dead is a great remake of a great movie.",1087948800,,1246,4.174273858921162
2066582,4,B00027SIUK,"Should this movie be compared to the original like with movie adaptions of brilliant books? It shouldn't because it can't really. Romero's Zombies were more like a cartoonish over-the-top recreation of what we humans are: Rather slow, lame, easy getting killed, consuming, consuming, partly animalistic by seeking for food and territorial defense (but no sex), consuming, consuming and, yeah, consuming - to the point where nothing else counts, where humans start devouring themselves, where the urge to consume (eat) is even retrained when there is no stomach left in the body (see DAY OF THE DEAD), and where everyone not acting the same seems alien (and must be eaten as well...). Humans are so addictive to consumption, one way to draw a picture of ""humans"" who are more extrem than that are zombis.
While it is obvious that Romero's goal was not to do a horrifying bloody flick at first, this ""remake"" is exactly that. And it suceeds extremly well in being so. I was put deeply down into the theater chair from the first to the last second. The apocalypse is great, the action is heavy, the terror is consitent and astonglishy surprising (think the chainsaw scene), the ending is the way it should be: hopeless.
Some tiny things I did not really like. For example I'd have liked to see the surivors reach the mall by total different ways, some lonely desperate survivors fighting themselves along a longer path to reach the mall, as in the movie that chaos begins, then we see a group of about 7 people meeting up right beneath the mall - entering it. From then on we witness how they 'live' in this terrible mini-universe-mall, untill, in the end, they are leaving throught HORDES of zombies to meet their final end. And, off course, the zombies are just raging monsters, pretty different from ""normal"" humans. But then I'm comparising again with the main subject of the original movie that would admittedly seem a little washed-out nowadays.
Result: an action-packed, terribly entertaining, bloody, horrifying flick. I guess I'll watch it again some day.",1087948800,,2061,4.908309455587393

Dawn of the Dead (2004) Marks the Return of the Living Dead to the Horror genre. This Re-envisioning of George A. Romero's 1978 Cult Classic is much different than the original. The Concept of Flesh Eating Zombies and survivor's holed up in a shopping mall stays the same, But everything that made the original great is changed to update the film for todays action Driven Audiences.
Dawn 2004, is not the cheesy remake some would make it out to be, However, it moves with the pace of a High budget Action film that audiences are sure to like. The Often Morbid humor and deliberate offensiveness helps progress the film to heights not acheived in horror in quite sometime.

2066589,5,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead is an absolutely awesome movie, it is one of the bloodiest if not the bloodiest movie in a long time and kicks the utter sh*t out of resident evil wich i think is a good comparison especially the if you've seen both in cinemas. Dawn of the dead is action packed and quite humerous at parts and has such a brilliant concept to it. The movie begins right away when Nurse (Sarah polley) is attacked by her infected husband and runs outside and escapes via car only to see that society as she knows it has gone hay wire and a war zone of burning buildings, destroyed homes and the undead multiplying is the only thing in sight. Sarah Polley drives through the highway dodging cars and zombies in the hope to find safety and/or shelter when she crashes her car, from there on, our heroine nurse joins arms with a big mean motor scooter cop (vingh Rhames), a young man and his pregnant wife and a brave man with a good head on his shoulders, they soon take refuge in a giant shopping mall and start locking and bolting all entrances. But after not too long few of the undead make there way inside only to be greeted with bullets to their heads, soon after it is established that shooting them in the head is an instant kill.
From here on in it is pure mayhem and massacre for the rest of the movie. This  film really has excellent acting, very good characters, lots of blood and mountain loads of action, and the opening and ending sequences are very unique and very grisly, and in response to the dip sh*t who said the movie had a bad ending, forget that sh*t, the ending was very good and whether or not there is a sequel the film finished good. the film might sound a little corny (probably just to those who don't understand these sorts of films) but it's nothing but hardcore horror all the way, highly reccomended",1086912000,2,1830,4.350877192982456
2066590,5,B00027SIUK,"The newer ""Dawn of the Dead"" has a simple, yet great opening, in which Sarah Polly (!), the heroine of the film, witnesses the end of the world.  It's a dynamite opening, and as it shows, Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of the George A. Romero classic lives up to its name.  In short, it's a must for any horror fans.
The new ""DOTD"" basically follows the same route.  Sarah Polly's nurse Anna is suddenly attacked by a group of zombies, and is trapped in a shoping mall as a makeshift fort, where she and other survivers have to think of the way of survival.  The ""living"" include; Ving Rhames (as a tough cop), Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer (and his love), and others, plus a dog 'Chips.'  You can see among them the faces like Matt Frewer, and from the original there are cameos of Scott Reinger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree, all of whom appear on TV.
The newer one has made a big change: the zombies run, and run very fast.  While Romero's zombies walked like old-fashioned robot, the updated 'un-dead' run wild, which is really scary.  Though the rule of ""bullet in the head"" is the same as old, the survival gets harder than before, and consequently the film gives greater number of characters, which have to go one after another.
Interesting thing is, this ""DOTD"" knows that good horror films need inevitably a slight amount of humor (dark ones), and it does not fail to give that to us.  The ""KILL ROSIE GAME"" played with another surviver who happens to live in a gunshop across the street makes you laugh, embarrasingly perhaps.  It's a guilty pleasure, sure, but what did you expect from a film titled like this?
We have two big surprises -- one, you never dreamed of seeing Sarah Polly, who had been in mainly indie films like ""My Life without Me,"" in Hollywood's major horror film.  The casting works tremendouly, because as you know, she can really act (like Drew Barrymore, she was a good example of successful ex-child actor).  Two, the real surprise is that this is the feature debut of director Zack Snyder, whose impressive visual sense matches the storytelling skills.  Want to remake ""Superman""?  GIve it to him.
Actions are bloody, full of gore splutterd across the screen, but, well, this is supposed to be so, and as such ""DOTD"" delivers.  The film is appropriately loud and violent, but occasional tongue-in-cheek moments tell us that this is an entertainment.  Not a healthy one, maybe, but certainly gripping and chilling, with a bit of funny.",1086566400,3,2455,4.637413394919169
2066591,4,B00027SIUK,"I was curious to see it. Texas Chainsaw Massacre the remake was a great surprise so why not? with the progress made in SFX nowadays, I was thinking, it'll be bloody! I confirm. Dawn Of the Dead the remake is a cool movie. The original version was my fave Zombie movie so I came with the eye of a critic. There's no big difference with the original, the story is quite the same except the end going further.
If I remember, the original end, was the two last survivors leaving the mall with an helicoptere. Here they leave on a different way but well, it's cool and well done.
The only negative points...
1/ The teenager girl who leaves the mall to drive a truck (Yes, she knows how to drive a truck...cool), and crushes hundred of zombies ( yes, she's not scared...cool) to save a dog (yes, she really loves animals to death...cool)
2/ When they get to the Marina, they know everything about the boat. They know how it looks and find it right away. Otherwise, they know how to navigate it. You'll understand what I mean.
3/ A pity there are not those bad Hell's angels coming over the mall and bring some more massacres..For those who saw the original, they will know what I'm talking about.
About the SFX and visual effects, of course they're bloody great. Of course the dialogue is sometimes a bit cheezy and some of the characters a bit ridiculous but well...
100 times or more better than the ""28 days later"" treating the same subject, Dawn of the dead is sick, bloody and I really enjoyed...I believe a sequel will come to light in the following years...when dead have no room left in Hell certainly.",1086566400,,1604,4.459183673469388

I don't know whether I like this one or 28 days later more, but it's close. I'm tempted to say this one because at least the zombies in this movie are actually undead instead of just being ""infected"". The ""dead"" thing is just a little cooler.

2066600,3,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead is Universal's new remake of George Romero's 1978 classic cult film, about flesh-eating zombies that take over the world. A small group of survivors take refuge in a local mall, where they formulate a plan to decamp to a more secure area.
  Zach Snyder's directorial debut takes a completely different approach to the classic horror flick, in ways for better and for worse. Unlike Romero's original, the makeup work on the zombies is shockingly repulsive, which makes recent zombie movies such as House of the Dead and Resident Evil look silly.
  Featuring a second-rate cast that includes Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley, and Mekhi Phfier, Dawn of the Dead has little to offer in regards to acting. Screenwriter James Gunn, whose most notable work to date is Scooby-Doo, should take some of the blame for the offbeat acting, owing to his inability to develop the characters well. Take Ving Rhames' character for example: a religious cop whose only concern throughout this entire ordeal is whether or not his brother is still alive. That's about as far as his character stretches. In most cases, characters are individualized simply by their first name.
  Gunn's mishaps do not stop there, however. Like all mediocre horror movies, the plot is completely dreadful. Characters with learning curves of four year-old children often find themselves unable to come up with the obvious solution. At one point in the movie, the entire group risks their lives in an obvious suicide mission to save one person. The film drags on, which makes its 96-minute runtime seem a whole lot longer.
  Despite the overall substandard nature of the film, there are several positive attributes that save it from complete disaster. The usage of comedy in unexpected situations generates some laughter from audiences, even though it seems off base at times. In one particular scene, the survivors have narrowly escaped the zombies by packing into an elevator. When hearing the elevator music playing in the background, one character comments, ""Hey... I like this song.""
  Besides comedy, the most appealing aspect of Dawn of the Dead happens to be its gritty, but colorful photography. Matthew Leonetti, who has over 30 years experience in the cinematographic field, also flaunts his skill with a camera throughout the film; the car sequence at the beginning being a great example.
  At the end of the day, however, Dawn of the Dead doesn't present enough positive qualities to make both your time and money worth-while.",1086480000,,2507,5.058252427184466
2066601,5,B00027SIUK,"Zack Snyder's fast paced remake of George Romero's 1978 low budget cult film may not win the hearts and minds of all Romero's legion of fans......however that's their bad luck. On it's own merits, the 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a genuinely scary, roller coaster ride into the genre of the living dead. What it may lack from the original in making comments about consumer greed, dysfunctional society and other social issues, it more than makes up for in being a successful meshing of blood thirsty zombies meets the action movie genre.
The new film steers away from the initial reason highligted in Romero's 1967 ""Night Of The Living Dead"" , that radiation from an aborted Venus probe are reanimating the recently dead. This time around, an unknown virus, transmitted by bites from infected / undead humans is the cause of the deadly plague. Snyder's film starts off innocently enough in an ""everyday"" atmosphere surrounding a suburban hospital and an average suburban neighbourhood, however all hell suddenly breaks loose, and the landscape of Everett, Wisconsin is plunged into anarchy as neighbours attack each other and those still mobile, flee to find supposed sanctuary. The other key change is that in the original Dawn, Romero's zombies, whilst hungry for human flesh, just shuffled around the place as if they were heading home after a heavy evening at their local bar, and were only of threat to the films heroes when in weight of numbers. Snyder's zombies however, bear more resemblance to the ""infected"" in Danny Boyle's recent ( and much over rated ) ""28 Days Later"".....the zombies in ""Dawn 2004"" are fast on their feet, hyper aggresive and screech like ravenous hyenas when they are in pursuit of their human prey.
Creative cinematography by Matthew Leonetti, razor sharp editing by Niven Howie and an excellent soundtrack including Johnny Cash singing ""The Man Comes Around "" over the opening credits all contribute to keep the audience entertained and on the edge of their seats. Sarah Polley & Ving Rhames are the two key leads, one a nurse, the other a police officer, and both meeting up with a rag tag bunch of survivors and taking shelter in an enormous shopping mall. In joke : One of the stores in the centre is named ""Gaylen Ross"".....lead actress from the first Dawn. In addition, fellow cast members from the original Dawn, Ken Foree ( Peter, the SWAT Trooper ) has a cameo as a TV evangelist, where he repeats his famous quote about ""When there's no more room in hell..."", and Scott H. Reiniger ( the other SWAT Trooper ) is an Army general on TV telling the populace not to panic. Plus SFX make up maestro Tom Savini, is a local sheriff out leading a posse shooting and burning corpses.
Being a very keen fan of the Romero series of living dead films, I must admit I viewed the approaching remake with some apprehension, however I was more than pleased after seeing the final result. Especially given the most recent key theatrical releases surrounding the living dead ( Resident Evil & 28 Days Later ) were both rather toothless and lack lustre. So, leave your ""don't mess with the classics"" prejudices at home, and enjoy the latest ""Dawn of the Dead"" for what it is.....an intelligent, fuel injected horror / action film with just the right dose of humour and sarcasm.

2066602,4,B00027SIUK,"""When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth"".
Lo, another remake is upon us! This time Hollywood have set their sights on updating the 1979 George Romero classic, DAWN OF THE DEAD, #2 in his DEAD trilogy, and my fave of the series.
After seeing the remake of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE a few months back & enjoying it more than the original, my horror-hungry little self was literally salivating at the chance of seeing this. So how does this DAWN stack up to the original? Uhhhh. Wellll....
The main problem here probably has to do with the period between the movies. In 1979 the mix of Tom Savini's gore, and George Romero's screenplay which managed to mix gore, action and slapstick comedy effectively into one of the great zombie flicks of all time. In 2004, what do you do? Here, screenwriter James Gunn and director Zack Snyder (who has a cameo as a commando) add a little bit of T&A -not much, but enough to give a nerd chronic asthma-, a boring sex scene which ends in a gory death which horror fans will see coming, thus this scene has no impact; & a predictable ""shock"" scene in which one of the freedom fighters becomes the proud daddy of an ugly little slimeball- and promptly blows the little sucker's head off. There's one way to work the taboo subject of infanticide into your film and get away with it! But how about doing it with some style and originality? Just because much of the cast are ""zombies"", it doesn't necessarily mean the target audience is either!
Anyway, the concept here is basically the same: After a plague of zombies begin ravaging a small town a band of uninfected people (and a dog! Dogs rule!) seek refuge inside an abandoned shopping mall, with the dead outside aiming to get in and infect them. The cast which includes Ving Rhames (at his bad-ass best), Mekhi Phifer and Matt Frewer, is quite good, and the gore scenes are bound to whet the appetites of horror fans, but what humor there is in the movie can't even come close to Romero's film They didn't even bother to re-shoot the scene where the biker gang are wasting the zombies in the mall! You've got to wonder if the people who spend their time & energy on these movies even had a genuine passion and fondness for the original! But the most fun I had was my amusement at the teenage girls sitting in front of me who spent most of the movie screaming and covering their eyes. One thing I love about going to movies like this is sitting near the back and just casually observing how people react. That's half the fun of going to horror or controversial movies. (Which is why I'm dying to see IRREVERSIBLE and KEN PARK. Knowing my luck I'll be in a rest home slurping pureed meatloaf through a straw by the time that happens).
However unlike the Romero flicks where the zombies just shuffle around lethargically, here they can actually RUN, which lends a bit more pace (& ""credibility""- sixty six, ninety nine) to the movie, so we get more scenes of people having their brains sucked out, arms torn out of their sockets, and faces gnawed off. GOOD CLEAN R16 RATED FUN!
It can't hold a candle to its grand-daddy, but DAWN OF THE DEAD is still OK entertainment. In retrospect though, afterwards I kind of felt that I'd just spent NZ $8.50 watching a pack of zombiefied New Zealand First supporters go on the rampage.

Others say that the ending sucked, but then how could you end it, certainly a happy ending would have ruined the film, and i love the home made look! If you see one Zombie film this year view this one, and if you liked resident evil and perhaps thought 28 days later was good you will love this. The effects and make up will knock your socks off!

2066606,1,B00027SIUK,"This film could have been much better. As with any horror film, the big pay-off is the creep-out factor. Just the premise alone here is ample reason for nightmares. The world culture has collapsed and the recently dead are walking around with a taste for human flesh?! That's plenty of nightmare, all by itself. Unfortunately, this time around, newcomer director Zack Snyder chose to give the zombies the ability to run, fight, jump and stalk. What this shows is that the director just doesn't understand. You don't NEED go any farther than promote a feeling of dread and dire hopelessness to make this film work. You don't need (and shouldn't have) running combat scenes as if this were some horrific ""re-imagining"" of ""Die Hard.""
This film is, of course, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name. The overall plot is vaguely similar, with several people hold up in a shopping mall surrounded by thousands of the undead outside, banging on the doors. But there the similarities end. Ana (Sarah Polly) is a nurse who wakes to see her husband being killed, who then promptly gets up and attacks her, too. After the mad dash, she hooks up with Ving Rhames and some others who run into a mostly vacant shopping mall. After it becomes evident that no help is forthcoming, our motley bunch must use their wits (what's left of them) to survive.
I must say that I wanted to like this film. I recently saw a piece of the original ""Dawn"" on TV and even 15 minutes scared the wits right out of me. When I was younger, I'd seen this film many times and it never failed to scare me. What the original had, which this updated version lacks, is the hopelessness. The feeling of overwhelming dread. BECAUSE the older films didn't have special effects to fall back on, they had to have more inter-personal story. I wish this new version would have given us some time to get to know these people, add some back-story.
That is not to say that there weren't some chills. There were some scenes where my nerves were tested. But even in those scenes, they were tense mainly because the director constricted the field-of-view or turned down the lights. These are old, tired cinematic tricks. That, and the characters were doing foolish things like wasting ammo target shooting at zombies, for fun. I must say, I fail to understand why our hapless band are smiling and laughing. There is nothing at all funny about this situation:

*They are surrounded by a sea of zombies who mean them harm.
*NO ONE is coming to save them.
*For all they know, this is a world-wide meltdown.
*All of their family and friends are likely dead, or worse.
*They have a finite food and ammo supply.
*They have absolutely no idea where they can go for safety
*or how they're going to get there, if they did
*they're in a building with hundreds of unguardable doors and windows
*They are ALONE, unprepared, under siege, and will likely die---tomorrow, or maybe in the next 10 minutes...

...and there is something to smile about? I don't think so. I don't see what's so darn funny. What should have been a story to chill the blood instead deteriorated into a cookie-cutter film not much different from your typical ""them against us"" action-oriented fare.
At the end of the original film, it ends on the roof with a helicopter, something like this: ""How much fuel do we have?"" ""I don't know.....Not much."" ""all right then, let's go."" And they fly off into the abyss.

I only wish this remake could have given us at least that much feeling. Instead, it was something more akin to teen slasher film, unworthy of its namesake.",1085616000,4,3578,4.622641509433962
2066607,4,B00027SIUK,"Not too long ago, in one of my reviews, I expressed my longing for the remake of George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" to prove wrong the hoopla that the mass arrival of classic remakes was to no one's benefit. Marcus Nispel delivered a heavily stylized update of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" that really didn't improve on anything except cinematography (by the same DP of the original). The decision to give these films to virtual unknowns was a huge gamble on the behalf of the studios who financed these remakes, and this time, they got it right. Zach Snyder, with an assured hand and a respectful nod of the hat to his predecessor, has crafted a remake worthy of comparison to the original. Though not half as socially relevant or satirical of the times, this ""Dawn of the Dead"" blasts from start to finish with a single-minded energy that makes it the best of the remakes so far.
The opening of the film, rounding out at about ten minutes from production company logo to ""Directed by Zach Snyder"", is one of the most compelling, scary, pulse-pounding introductions I've ever seen. It deserves comparison to Takashi Miike's hellacious ""Dead or Alive."" Complete with Johnny Cash's fantastic musical accompaniment, it strikes a tone that is hard to live up to for the rest of the film, but Snyder does his best, and manages to come out on top.
The plot is simple, and has been done before, but rarely with such zest: An unexplained phenomenon (what explanation could possibly suffice?) sweeping the nation is turning human beings into flesh craving ghouls, quick on their feet, and vastly increasing in numbers. The disease, virus, or whatever it is, is only transferrable through the bites of the infected, no matter if it's a tiny nick or an artery-tearing gash. Sarah Polley very simply observes: ""Bites killed her. Bites brought her back."" Polley is one of the rogue's gallery of survivors that inhabit Crossroads Mall during the invasion, along with Ving Rhames' tough as nails policeman, Jake Weber's sensible divorcee, and Mekhi Phifer's desperate former felon. The acting in the remake is vastly superior to the original, and gives us a wider variety of characters to identify with, which is an important step because of the absence of Romero's looting bikers. These are, for the most part, likable people, and even the ones we would sooner see mauled to death have moments that make us laugh. (""Alright, we draw straws, and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich."")
The best scenes of the film are between the Ving Rhames character and a gun store owner across the parking lot from the mall, named Andy. They converse through the use of binoculars and dry-erase marker boards, and even manage to play a game of chess. In one hilarious sequence that is on a par with the best satirical moments in the original film, the mall survivors pick out celebrity lookalikes in the zombie crowd and flash their names to Andy, across the way, who picks them off with a sniper rifle.
As I said before, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is pure energized filmmaking of a high caliber. It doesn't try and be Romero's original film, and in that way, it stands on its own, with its satire carefully concealed in its music (when the survivors first break into the mall, ""Don't Worry Be Happy"" plays over the speakers). The action sequences toward the end are shot half on film and half on digital video (a la ""28 Days Later""), and in one effects shot, involving a propane tank and a flare, we get one of those rare moments that inspires applause during a film. This, combined with the performances, great makeup effects, an embrace of the gore that Romero pioneered, and that kinetic opening, make this a perfect companion piece to sit next to the original ""Dawn"" on collectors' shelves everywhere.",1085529600,2,3788,4.749620637329286
2066608,5,B00027SIUK,"To start off, the original Dawn Of The Dead could never be replaced or out done by a remake, but the remake is incredible just like the original.  The best thing about it was that it wasn't a duplicate of the original, like the remake of Psycho where it was exactly the same.  This film just takes the base story form the original, like the shopping mall, and then goes in it's own direction.  Now the zombies run, which I still haven't made up my mind about which is better walking or running zombies. This movie had eveything a great horror movie needs, the suspense, some jump scenes, a little nudity, I especially loved the scene where an acoustic version of Down With The Sickness is played.  All together this movie is really great with the effects, the gore, and an all around great story.

So who is to say that we should remake a perfect thing. somethings that are set in stone should not try to be made into daimonds. this movie was stupid. the plot was not good at all. the acting was as low as these actors could go. And just the simple fact that it was a remake of something good ruined the whole idea for me. in the original the zombies were slow, and stupid but they still scared us. In the new one, its tries to scare you with fast pacing action that turns out to be a predictable dud. I recommend to tinsel town that they start looking for new and fresh ideas and leave the timeless classics alone. and I recomend to you that you buy the new perfect Divimax version and leave this new one to rot in its grave",1085097600,2,1001,4.035175879396985

I, do, though, know when I hate a movie and when I love it, and oddly enough I can't say either about Dawn of the Dead. It's one of those strange, middle-of-the-road movies that I liked enough to sit through, but disliked it enough to not really recommend it to anyone. For one, the movie has enough character development for three typical slasher films, and it might surprise you to know that the whole middle stretch of the film favors that over gore. And it's a welcome change that only occasionally tried my patience. But all the sitting in the mall and fending off the zombies eventually comes to an end, and the movie comes to where it unfortunately stumbles: its long, drawn-out, completely overdone conclusion that you just eventually hope gets the hell over. For a movie that was doing so well up until that point, it commits the sin of overkill and just crams as much in as it possibly can...including over the end credits. Please, would someone tell me why in the hell some directors must stretch the conclusion of their film all the way through the end titles? I think it's called 'lack of talent,' and for all of the intelligent, promising things in Dawn of the Dead, it's the overkill and that finale that takes it from a B- to a GRADE: C+",1084665600,,1494,4.516605166051661

I used to consider my self a huge fan of Romero, but maybe I'm not as big a fan as I thought. I really enjoyed this great, horror, action, flick.
  I found the pacing, and rhythm of the film very exciting, and the fact that these ""zombies"" could move and attack like animals made them 10 times more threatning than Romeros. Where Romeros film is fun during the big zombie hunt, this one tends to make your heart pound.
  The acting in this one isn't necessarily better, perhaps just a little more polished, and experienced. I love Ving Rhames, and he is in all his tortured-soul,macho-man glory here, and it works.
  As far as the social commentary goes, Romero's anti-capitalist, anti-consumer message doesn't hold the water in 2004 that it may have in '78. We have been living with , and thriving on this ""mass consumerism"" for twenty-six years. Like all leftist flag wavers of the ;'60s & '70s he has turned out to be...WRONG!! Dont misunderstand I thought Romeros message was brilliantly put forth, weather I agree with it or not, but to put that message in a modern flick is just silly.
  For all of you who aren't familiar with this whole ""dead issue"", be leery of those who say, ""I really wanted to like this.."", or "" Despite being against the making of this film, and loathing the very idea..I still went to the movies with an open mind..."" Bull.

If you are just looking for violence and an update on the zombie make-up, go for this one.  The only real problem that I see is that it should have been titled something different so as not to mislead people.  Other than that, this is a great flick with a lot of eye candy, little thought involvement, and an appropriate ending (if you disagree, you didn't watch through the credits).  Don't let the fact that the makers of the modern Dawn of the Dead used the title of the original make you bitter.

2066626,1,B00027SIUK,"When I first heard that an adaption (woulldn't call it a remake because it doesn't use the same script and too much has been changed from the original storyline), I wasn't at thrilled. I decided thought o go see it with an open mind anyway. I wish I didn't.
George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978) was a social commentary with elements of horror (as were his other 2 films of the Living Dead Trilogy, Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Day of the Dead (1985)), using aspects of society from each given decade.
Where was the social commentary here in Dawn 2K4? Well, as a faithful Romero fan, I didn't see it. There was no attack on any aspect of society in this film. Plus, consumerism has been around far too long in society today to attack, as it was in the original. There were too many characters in the film for character development. It seemed like all the survivors made it into the mall and suddenly they started getting killed, and not by zombies. At least you cared somewhat about the 4 survivors in the original. This one, they ended up as zombie food, if the were fortunate enough. And what was up with those super-strength zombies? They seemed to have more strength than the survivors did. I guess the dead are physically stronger than the living. The zombies also seemed to have more intelligence than the original, especially that one zombie who was scaling that pipe on the ceiling of the mall garage and hopped onto the back of the security guard. That zombie seemed pretty smart to me to figure out how to sneek up on someone. The living also seemed less intelligent. The original, the survivors stayed in the mall till their security was compromised by the bikers. In the this one, didn't make sense why they left. Because, maybe, the zombies might find a way in? Well, I guess with only 1 group of survivors (there were 2 in the original, the 4 in the mall and the bikers outside), there wouldn't need a reason too leave. There wasn't also any good zombie humor either. Sooting zombies that looked like celebrities? Hardy har har. Didn't see much humor in that. And the ending, god it sucked. As in the original, Romero left it to the viewer's imagination what happened after the last 2 survivors left the mall. In this one, you know they became a zombie buffet. Plus the original had a lot more gore in it than this one. The only zombie attack that was faithful, to the original was in the beginning when little girl zombie took a bite out of the husband. Where were the zombies that were ripping the living apart? At least int he original you saw figures being chewed of and intestines being ripped out. Plus, in the original, religion played a bigger role. Why were all the zombies kept in the basement in the original? Because, as the priest explained it, people still had respect in dying. Ptere, 1 of the survivors in the original, also explained in religious terms that in voodooism, which is a religion, ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk th earth."" So that's were that came from. Not explained clearly enough in this film. Well, I could go on even further, but I do haver a mximum number of words I can put into this.
One last though though, who was this film inteneded for? Surely, it wasn't geared to true fans of George A. Romero's Living Dead Trilogy. Maybe it was towrds the MTV generation, that likes anything that's put in front off them anyway. And with the rumors I've heard about a remake of Day of the Dead, they should then let Romero remake his own film the way he originally intended to make it. Or just give him the money to make the last and final Living Dead chapter (Dead Reckoning, Twilight of the Dead, or Dusk of the Dead, or whatever the title will end up being). Hope the day comes soon when we can't call his cult classics a trilogy anymore.
By the way, if you need to right a sociology paper in college on social aspects in a movie, I highly recommend one of George A. Romero's Living Dead films. Mine was titled ""The Holy Trilogy"" and I received an A on it. Wouldn't recommend Dawn 2k4 at all, for any reason.",1083628800,12,4089,4.431606905710491
2066627,2,B00027SIUK,"What ticks me off isn't that this movie was re-made. That's really only a quarter of my anger. What really makes me mad (and I mean raging, running ZOMBIE mad) is that George Romero has been trying to get funding for years to make his fourth ""Dead"" film and this piece of junk is greenlighted. So, instead of seeing a less violent, well thought-out and BRAND NEW zombie picture, we get a hackneyed, burnt-out, steroid-injected remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" for the hip-hop generation???
Makes perfect sense to me. Just be sure to kick the chair of the Eminem-wannabe in front of you who keeps repeating the phrase, ""Aw, yeah! Dat's so TYGHT!"" everytime a zombie attacks the camera-crew...er, I mean band of survivors.
Zach Snyder's pointless remake of George Romero's classic horror film starts out promising, then takes a turn for the worse. What plagues the Earth is not really explained at all. So, it's kinda like a Nameless Virus. Anyway, the Nameless Virus takes over the Earth in about 11 minutes. Why is it so important that we know the reason why the good human race is turning into zombies?
It's simple, really.
You see, REAL zombies are brain-dead. That means, if they are animated, they're gonna move like molasses. Those younger viewers who have seen this movie are going to say some fun things like, ""This was just as good as '28 Days Later'"" or ""this was better than '28 Days Later'"" or even something that will make you so happy that you will want to put a bullet in your head, like, ""fast-moving zombies are really scary!!!""
Zombies are slow. They move slow. They always have moved slow. Numbers were their strong-suit. You moved wrong, did something stupid, you were dinner. You made a mistake and put yourself in a corner, you were dinner. And again, they moved slow. And you were surrounded. You saw death coming and you couldn't do anything about it. THAT was scary. Everything these days must be fast, including horror films. The killer in ""Scream"" was fast. The zombies in ""Resident Evil"" were fast. The infected in ""28 Days Later"" were fast...and that brings me to my point:
This movie sucks. This movie is NOT ""28 Days Later"", nor is it BETTER than that movie, nor is it just as good. It doesn't even deserve to be called ""Dawn of the Dead"". Call us zombie fans ""nerds"" but there's one factor that makes this movie needless, unintelligent, unwatchable sludge: those crazy, monsters who should be less obssessed with consuming human flesh and more concerned with training for next year's Olympic games. Call us zombie fans ""movie snobs"", but the reason why ""28 Days Later"" had those angry, hyped-up, caffeinated...well, I hesitate to even refer to them as ""zombies"", so I will call them infected humans, since that's what they were...the only reason they could move like they did was because, they weren't DEAD, they were living people infected by a virus that stimulated the part of the brain that caused anger and unnatural rage. That makes any comparison from ""Dawn of the Dead"" to ""28 Days"" null and void. If you're dead and you come back to life, you won't be running for the Jamaican relay team, you'll be carrying your almost disembodied leg as you wander to the closest thing that resembles your lunch: a human being. If you have been infected by a virus and you die and come back to life, you won't be towards a living soul like a baserunner coming around third and heading for home plate. You'll be attempting to outrun the snail that's trying to break for the same patch of lawn as you are. You are a zombie. You move SLOW. That's zombie law. You can't run like the Six-Million Dollar Man. You can't jam around a corner like a $35,000 BMW. You CAN'T. You will move a foot every three or four seconds. Hence the phrase, ""you're moving like a zombie, hurry up!""
Forgiving all that I have given you above, I should probably mention that Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley head up a cast of cliched characters which include The Black Guy, The Pregnant Girl with the Zombie Baby (yes, the Zombie Baby), The Morally Converted Security Guard, The Nurse, The Mean Guy, The Sweet Doggie, and more. And it all takes place at the mall where the suvivors have made their new home. Of course, zombies are headed to the mall. Why? Good question. In the original, there was still a microscopic part of the zombies that recognized it as a place to mecca. It was a brilliant metaphor that Romero put on us: we're all just a bunch of dumb, brain-dead, culture-and-fad-obssessed zombies. The Mall was just as much a character as the rest of the other characters. The zombies in this film seem more concerned with just death and destruction and eating more to further their cause...nice try at a metaphor...but it doesn't work.
If anything, Romero's point still stands strong today. Want proof?
We all flocked like zombies to this stinkbomb, didn't we?

2066628,5,B00027SIUK,"Ok not really, just kidding... seriously. I loved this movie and I clearly remember being kind of angry when it was fist announced. Why? Well I'm quickly approaching that point in my life called the mid-twenties and I have fond memories watching the original with my best friend on VHS and having the time of my cinematic life. I, along with my friend, always believed it was the best zombie movie ever and definitely one of the best horror movies. We are self-proclaimed avid horror fans you see. Then the movie came out and weird things started happening. Good reviews started trickling in. Entertainment Weekly gave it an A? Ebert gave it 3 of of 4? Well holy crap. Turns out this is one of the best remakes I have ever seen along with Carpenter's ""The Thing"". What's good about it? For once an R rated movie didn't skimp on the gore. The characters are awesome, played beautifully by Vign Rhames and Sarah Polley who I haven't seen since the very cool ""Go"" as well as some new faces that do a great job. Perhaps the best praise I can give this movie is that comparing it to the original is so very hard for me. I almost have to admit to myself I like the new model better. I mean I'll always come back to it thanks to the near and dear place it's always held in my movie collection but this new one has it beat at nearly every level. You purists may hate me but you can't deny the new one has what many horror movies lack these days, and that is huge balls. It carries them proudly too and the only proof you need of this is that birth\baby scene .... oh yeah and that lounge lizard remake of Disturbed's ""Down with the sickness,"" pure genius I say.",1083369600,2,1653,4.301282051282051
2066639,5,B00027SIUK,"I know a lot of people are going to disagree with this review BUT this is my opinion, I watched the Original ""Dawn"" a few weeks ago on DVD before seeing the 2004 remake in theatres so that I could both know what to expect and I didn't see the original TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) before the 2003 remake and I regreted it very much, I must say that I can see how lots of people are calling the original version ""a true horror classic"", ""an epic in zombie terror"" and so on and so forth, but since I've just seen it, I would say that the 2004 version of Dawn Of The Dead is 100 times better than the original. In the original, the zombies were sluggish, blue, moaned and were not scary at all, the 2004 version, the zombies ran after victims like olympic athletes, decaying, screaming, and I was very much scared seeing it in the theatre with other terrified viewers. The original movie spent most of its time devoted to the characters and only a 1/4 on the zombies and terror, the original version also only had four main human characters while the remake has over 10 actors so you have almost no clue who will ""die"" and survive and the action/violence kept my adrenaline pumping because in the original, the zombies were VERY easy targets. The ending (don't worry, I'm not going to spill any beans here) was a definate improvement, in the original, our heroes just flew away in a helicopter and thats it, The ending was very unexpected and a great improvement. The remake was by far one of the most scary, entertaining and enjoyable movies that I have seen so far for 2004 and I will definately get it on DVD but I will get the unrated version because I hear its loaded with deleated scenes and gore which you didn't see in the theatre.",1083369600,2,1738,4.38390092879257
2066640,4,B00027SIUK,"I thought they did a good job with this remake, it was a much faster paced movie, and there were very few boring parts. I liked the more modernized (28 days later/demons) zombies, that run after cars like the T1000 in T2.
 The special effects were brilliant, however the gore and violence paled in comparison to the original Dawn, which in my opinion was one of ther most graphic horror films produced. The stuff in the '04 vesrion was barely G-rated compared to the original. There was a lack of gut munching, and when someone fell victim to a zombie swarm, they kind of let the scene fade out, leaving you to use your imagination.
 All in all, I was pleased, and am looking forward to purchasing this film on dvd this summer, along with the directors cut of the original, which I have on vhs. I reccomend that version to anyone who has not seen it yet, there aren't more zombie scenes, just more interaction with 4 main characters, and a better explanation of the scene when they all meet at the chopper, and have the run in with the police after Steven is caught stealing gas.",1083369600,,1079,4.444444444444445

DOTD combines everything you want in an action movie with a new and utterly terrifying horror aspect; zombies that can run!

2066647,5,B00027SIUK,"Just when I thought no film on the planet could ever scare the &^%$ out of me, the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" comes along and proves me horribly wrong (no pun intended).  I have seen just about every horror flick that was deemed so-called ""Scary"" in recent years, but this one tops them all.  I may honestly have nightmares, something I've only had over my failed marriages in those same recent years - LOL.  This blood bath is so frightening I held my own hand throughout the film.  It didn't help.  I jumped out of my skin so often I felt like a 50-year-old iguana.

Loosely based on the original film by George Romero back in 1978 (26 years ago), this is a must for every horror fan.  I don't think a film has taken me on this type of ride since ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""The Exorcist"".  Even then, ""Lambs"" could be considered a ""slow"" movie when compared to the ""Dead"".  I had never heard this quote before today's feature.  It explains so well the true nature of zombies:  ""When there's no more room in Hell. The dead will walk the earth.""  And they do...

Many of my colleagues have seen this film.  Two of them told me they walked out of the theatre...1) for the non-stop gore  2) for the scene with the pregnant girl.  Trust me my buds, if you like flesh-crawling terror, this one is for you.  I will be first in line to buy this DVD when it hits the market.  It is so well done (considering the source), I was actually looking over my shoulder during the screening.  This was a lunchtime treat at my local theatre and there were only three people in the audience (it's been out for four weeks).

Furthermore, if you are a Quentin Tarantino fan (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs), then you must know what he said in a recent issue of ""Entertainment Weekly"".  When asked, ""So what recent movies have you enjoyed?"", Tarantino responded, ""I can't believe it, but I really liked the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"".  It was terrific.  I don't really expect to see much better film-making in any set piece this year than that.  I was almost offended when (they announced) a remake - I mean, the idea of remaking a George Romero film without George Romero!.  And there are things about the new ""Dead"" that don't compare favorably at all. In the original, Romero used mostly amateur actors from Pittsburgh and they're giving their all, and you just completely buy into these characters in this world gone wrong.  They become your friends.  It wasn't like a character in a movie just got killed, it was like, Oh, this is horrible.  It had the most intense character study of almost any pure genre movie.  Even the zombies had personalities.""

I thing (the only thing) that I don't like in the old version is that the zombies are just too slo.....ow, which tames down a little bit of their scariness.  In this new version, the zombies are more energetic, at least they are running.  (in a way they look like the zombies in 28 days later)
The new one is a repectful one because:
- after the first 5 minutes, the engine already starts, you don't need a long warm-up period;
- the opening credit is very horrifying, second only to SEVEN, which will make you really uncomfortable;
- although there are some stupid moments (come on, even SCREAM 2, etc has its really stupid moments), in general, the characters are not so nonsense;
- like the old version, it also has some humour in between the tension parts.

2066660,4,B00027SIUK,"I hate to admit it, but I've never seen Romero's original DAWN OF THE DEAD. I don't think it's a movie I would like to own, but it is a film I would like to see but unfortunately there isn't a video store around that has that film on its shelves. I like to have seen original films before I see the remakes, but that's just not the case here.

DAWN OF THE DEAD starts off interesting enough. You know at the beginning of the movie that this is going to be a zombie flick and the first five-ten minutes of the movie contain lots of scenes that appeal to the audience's apprehension and foreknowledge. The movie takes place in southern Wisconsin, near Milwaukee in Waukesha County (yeah! and area I'm familiar with). The heroine of the film, Ana, returns home from her job as a nurse at the hospital. She talks to some neighborhood children, particularly a girl, before getting home. Once there, she greets her husband and the two make love in the shower. All this time there are messages on television and the radio about some strange outbreak.

The next morning Ana and her husband are greeting by the young neighborhood girl--that Ana talked to the night before-standing in the doorway of their bedroom. Except the girl is not a girl anymore and has become a flesh eating monster. Leaping like superman, the creature jumps at Ana's husband and proceeds to chewing on his throat. Ana is able to get rid of the girl, but desperately tries to save her husband. But, he dies. Then he comes back and tries to eat Ana.

DAWN OF THE DEAD is a good zombie movie. Like the zombies in 28 DAYS LATER and other recent zombie movies, the zombies in the film aren't the slow moving creatures we remember from classic zombie creatures. Instead, the entire physical makeup of the dead changes when they become undead, allowing them to run at superfast speeds and possess incredible strength. This is an interesting element and one that makes the movie much more interesting.

The acting in the movie is fairly decent and there is some rather dark humor. The special effects are real and though the zombie outbreak is never explained, the sudden and unexplained appearance of the outbreak doesn't seem to take anything away from the movie. The movie is kind of gory, but not as bloody as it could have been with some shots filmed in a more artistic manner.

There's really only one major fault that I had with the movie: the ending. The ending of the movie totally ruins the rest of the picture. I won't give the ending away (which is revealed in the end credits), but it leaves one feeling terrible. It steals the catharsis away and instead gives the audience nothing in return except for nihilistic tendencies. Nevertheless, even though the final moments of the movie ruin the entire picture, it can't totally ruin the quality of story that came before. So, perhaps there's some hope after all.",1081987200,,2880,4.606237816764133

2066665,3,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead (Zack Snyder , 2004)

The first thing to know about the remake Dawn of the Dead, and you should know this before you go in, is that the only was a fan of the original is going to enjoy the remake is if you consider it as a completely separate film. The basic premise is here (small core of survivors, shopping mall), but the execution is completely different.

The new Dawn fits into the new ""fast zombie"" craze (Resident Evil, House of the Dead, 28 Days Later..., etc). You start off with a nurse (Sarah Polley, from Go) getting off at the end of a very busy day. She goes home, goes to sleep after some gratuitous shower sex with the husband, they wake up the next morning, and their neighbor has turned into a zombie. Uh oh. But not the shambling mound from a Romero movie, a zipping horror that can be across the room and latched onto your throat before you can say ""go rollerblade somewhere else willya?""

The nurse hooks up with a cop (Pulp Fiction/Holiday Heart's lovely Ving Rhames), the two of them hook up with three other survivors, the pragmatic type who still wants to save the world (Jake Weber [Wendigo/The Cell]) and the young lovestruck pregnant couple who just want to live long enough to have the baby (Mekhi Phifer, recently of 8 Mile, and  ER).

You can already see the difference; more survivors (and thus more potential zombie food). But what the movie gives us in expansiveness it sacrifices in content; where the longer, slower original film focused on creating wonderfully complex characters, the new version is concerned with giving you blood and bodies. And lots of both.

Which may be, perhaps, the only interesting comparison between the two. Romero's original has less blood, less gore, and by far a lower body count than does the remake. It got slapped with an X, this gets an R. Perhaps it's time to re-release the originals to get the funding for Twilight of the Dead? (One can only hope.)

If you look at the new Dawn of the Dead as just another fast-zombie flick, you're probably going to enjoy it. As long as, that is, you liked Resident Evil and 28 Days Later... and didn't think House of the Dead was too terribly awful. Get ready for an awful lot of jumps, some groanworthy humor (especially of the sick variety), and a soundtrack that veers from unlistenable to downright insane (Richard Cheese's lounge version of Disturbed's ""The Sickness""). Turn your brain off, you'll have a blast. It's only when you reflect on how much the original pressured you to turn on your brain that you start wondering why they felt the need to make this in the first place. ***",1081728000,3,2616,4.565031982942431

2066667,4,B00027SIUK,"Fast paced re-imagining of the original Dawn of the Dead is both an improvement over the original, and yet not as intelligent either. The original Dawn featured slow moving zombies and some jibes at consumerism. The Dead in this Dawn are surprisingly healthier...able to climb, jump and eat on the run, all while decomposing ungracefully. They're a lot scarier than they were in the 70's.
The Consumerist satire from the earlier film is gone, in part because rampant consumerism has WON in the intervening 20+ years. (Hard to make fun of encrouching materialism when its now an integral part of our culture. Have a Latte, darling...)
As an action film Dawn '04 succeeds, its fast paced, frightening, and bleak. In short, its worth the price of admission, and then some. On a more intelligent level, however, this film really blows it...
Survivors of the first few minutes of the movie make their way to a mall and relative safety. Within the mall it would appear that our heroes have ample supplies of just about everything, and yet they realy don't ever seem to try much of anything. With a whole world outside it doesn't seem to occur to anyone to try the internet, (something must still be on somewhere) rig a recon vehicle, devise some kind of body armor, or use the sewers a little more effectively in getting around. Still worse, our heroes when confronted with having to hang around in a safe mall with lots of neccessary supplies....choose to instead rig a couple of vehicles for a one way trip to...a marina ....to get a boat...so they can go to an island...and hopefully there aren't any zombies there...and hopefully there will be lots of supplies there...and hopefully no one infected will have thought of the same thing...
This whole silly sequence of bad logic results in half the survivors getting turned into various types of zombie chow, which I guess is what the script required, the other half manage to escape only to find out the other gaping flaws in their plans.
(Wouldn't it have been better to stay in the mall and wait it out a bit ? Maybe the zombies would have starved to death after awhile.)
All in all, not a bad film, but it missed being a lot better by giving us a script that required the the survivors to be as brain dead as the undead they faced.",1081555200,2,2281,4.6345679012345675
2066668,3,B00027SIUK,"A word to all Hollywood directors, editors and producers....... STOP USING THAT IRRITATING CHOP MOTION DIGITAL EDITING FOR ACTION SCENES !!!!
The new Dawn of the Dead remake started PERFECTLY with an opening that casts the proper sense of doom and rapidly escalating chaos.
At this point I was thinking... WOW finally a remake that is great and in some ways may even surpass the original.
Then as the film progresses, the inclusion of too many characters weakens the development and the movie begins to have a dragging feel that lessens your real interest or empathy for their plight.
However, the REAL thing that killed my enjoyment for this film was the last 1/3 of the movie where the final action and resolution starts kicking into motion.
The makers of the film chose to film this entire last 30% of the movie in that same irritating grainy, pixelated, choppy, skip frame, digital editing that I first remember seeing used in GLADIATOR'S opening battle scene.
Since GLADIATOR this style of action film editing seems to have become the trend for editors and directors to use.
It is supposed to introduce tension and energy but instead many people like myself find that instead it DETRACTS from the film as you really can't follow the action and it imparts a fake look to scenes.
When you use it non-stop for 30 minutes or so like in DAWN OF THE DEAD's final scenes it becomes downright annoying and removes any feelings of terror or suspense that had been developed in the earlier portion of the film.
Standard speed filming would have greatly improved the overall movie.
Attention Hollywood..... drop the choppy digital action editing trend..... it's not an effective visual tool..... just visually annoying to try and watch !!!",1081468800,2,1733,4.877966101694915
2066669,5,B00027SIUK,"I was one of the skeptics.  I didn't want Dawn of the Dead ""Hollywoodized"".  The original Dawn is my favourite zombie film ever and this remake could only taint the memories I had of the original.  There was no way I told myself that the remake would ever be able to capture the wild, reckless and rebellious 70's feel of the original.  The sublime gore effects of Tom Savini, the bright fake blood, the gunsmoke, the loud sound of motorcycles in a shopping mall.  If anything, the remake of NOTLD taught us that classic zombie films should not be remade right?
Well, the important point to remember here is that screenwriter James Gunn never intended this as a remake but instead as a reimagining.  Gunn after all was quoted in interviews as saying he was a humongous fan of Dawn growing up so he certainly didn't want to trash the spirit of the original either.  Instead of copying Romero, Gunn made a bunch of wild changes that seemed foolhardy to me at first but really work out well.  First off, no more shuffling zombies.  These zombies run, and run fast at that, as fast as T-1000's.  They don't moan, they screech. Loudly.  Working-class Pittsburgh is replaced by working-class Milwaukee.  And then there's the explosions and cool special effects thanks to the higher budget.  Despite all the changes, it doesn't forget its roots, like the ol' gunshot to the head formula and even a newscaster uttering the quote ""When there's no more room in hell...""
In the original Dwan, Romero created a semi-satire that spoofed the increasing materialism of our society.  It played for a lot of laughs and the zombies were not to be taken very seriously.  In the remake however, the tone is extremely bleak.  This new Dawn is filled with nihilism and pessimism, the picture dark, the mood one of despair.  There seems to be no hope whatsoever, and the survivors of the plague take no pleasure  in the freedom or sudden possession of materialistic goods that are now in their possession.  Thankfully and surprisingly, there is no self-referential elements to this movie. As a matter of fact, there is no mention of the specific time or era this is supposed to take place in.  There are no advertising or product plugs, not even in the mall.  No cellphones or rap music.  The only problem with this of course is that all the characters seem to act as though zombie movies were never in existence(they take half the movie to figure out that zombies must be shot in the head) but I prefer this minor annoyance to an entire movie of wink-wink nudge-nudge self-referential doodoo anyday.
The action is unrelenting the whole way through, the actors extremely good, especially Canadian indy queen Sarah Polly.  She looks just as comfortable tending to the injured (she's a nurse) then she does blasting zombies with her shotgun.  Her supporting cast is also strong.  In my opinion, this new dawn is the best zombie movie I've seen in at least ten years, miles ahead of 28 days later and even better IMO than the Spierig Brothers' amazing ""Undead"", an Australian splatterfest that premiered at the Toronto Intenational film festival last year.  My only complaints are that I wasn't satified at the end, I wanted more.  Oh, and the absence of a biker gang.  I really would have loved bikers to break into the mall again this time around but this isn't the 70's anymore so I guess that wasn't meant to happen.
If anything, my viewing of the new Dawn taught me a valuable lesson: do not judge a book by its cover.  This film has exceeded all my expectations and I'm sure will be looked upon as a classic ten years from now.  Apologies are in order for James Gunn, Zack Snyder and everyone else involved with this film who had to listen to blind skeptics such as myself pour their rage all over the internet without having seen the movie first.  Coming from a previous skeptic whose favourite zombie film was the original Dawn I will say this; I was wrong, and if the next logical step is a remake of Day of the Dead, I will now welcome it with open arms, especially if the same crew are involved.",1081296000,,4080,4.625

Romero's original film benefits from a much better script.  The social commentary and character developement were fantastic, making the original Dawn the seminal zombie flick of it's time.  While I'm not a fan of ""shot by shot"" remakes of films, sticking a bit closer to the original would have pulled my rating up from four to five stars.
That is pretty much the only place the remake falters though.  The action is nice and fast paced, the zombie makeup was great and (I'm going to generate some negative votes with this statement) I liked the fast zombies.  By applying the logic that all reanimated dead creatures would be lumbering, shuffling, mindless automatons you close the possibility of fast paced exciting zombie, vampire and mummy flicks as well.  If one can suspend one's disbelief to the point where a little girl can return from the dead and crave human flesh, the fact that same can run down a hallway should not prove too much of a leap of faith.
I liken the new Dawn of the Dead to Steven Sommer's first Mummy flick.  An exciting, fast paced, popcorn reinterpretation of a classic sub-genre.  Besides, good box office for a remake of a Romero film can't get in the way of him getting the go ahead on his next picture.  Romero devotees might benefit from that particular revelation.

I didn't feel for the characters and the zombies were amusing if not outright laughable! The audience laughed out loud 5 times during this film. Having people laughing in a horror film is a major indication of something seriously wrong with the film.
The film is a satirical rendition of the original at best! It outrageously lacks depth, character development, gripping music/sound effect, convincing dialogue and horrifying zombies among other things. Such a letdown!
I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone. It's a waste of time, money and brain cells that have to endure processing such travesty.",1081036800,8,790,5.038167938931298
2066674,4,B00027SIUK,"Remakes of modern classics are inevitable, so this new version of George A. Romero's apocalyptic masterpiece ""Dawn of the Dead"" was about due, more than 25 years after the original was released. What surprised me is how much I enjoyed this remake, in the same way I enjoyed Tom Savini's underrated 1990 remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"", as an updated version that serves more as a tribute rather than a derivative knockoff.
This remake only resembles the original in setting and premise. The zombie pandemic sweeps over civilization overnight, causing widespread chaos from which few have survived. Seven survivors find each other and set up camp in a deserted shopping mall, which is convenient and protected. The survivors are a solid mix: A young sympathetic nurse (Sarah Polley), a grizzled cop (Ving Rhames), a level-headed Joe Everyman (Jake Weber), a young black professional (Mekhi Phifer), his pregnant Russian bride (Inna Korobkina, who has about two lines in the entire movie), and three loud mouthed security guards who cause the required tension. Unlike in the original, the mall itself is merely a setting, a place for survival. There are no satirical stabs at mindless consumerism that the original had, this is strictly a horror movie with a couple choice moments of humor thrown in. Don't expect to see zombies trying on hats or playing in the fountains.
Which brings us to the main attraction - the zombies. ""Dawn of the Dead"" will inevitably draw comparisons to ""28 Days Later"" for the fact that these zombies are a far cry from the slow, lurching zombies of George Romero's movies. These zombies will run up to you and rip you to pieces before you can look twice. They have no interest in the mall itself, just the people within. They only have one purpose - human flesh, and they are ravenous for it! The big kudos goes to the makeup effects people, who did a wonderful job making these zombies as nasty as possible. Aside from that, this new version has it's share of dramatic moments. Like the original, people bitten by the zombies invariably become zombies themselves, so the survivors have to make tough decisions when one of their own is bitten. The one element that is downplayed slightly is the apocalyptic subtext, where they could conceivably be the only people left in the world. The emotion associated with that kind of reality is not really expressed here. Instead, the filmmakers have focused on the character tension, the death scenes, and those wonderful fright gags that make up jump 10 inches off your chair. Be ready for them.
It would be too obvious to say that this remake is not as good as the original, because you simply cannot top a masterpiece, but the remake exceeded all my expectations. The style of filming, the acting (which is for the most part pretty good), and the Romero homages (which any fan will easily spot) make this a fun ride for horror fans, as well as a good introduction for people new to the genre. This will be a welcome addition to my horror collection when it comes out on DVD.",1081036800,,3051,4.76937618147448
2066675,4,B00027SIUK,"I was psyched to hear that they were remaking this film, but kinda skeptikal after seeing the trailer. First of all, I was kind of ticked that these zombies could run. I thought it would make them less scary, but it actually worked for this picture. I was also wondering why they were going to have so many survivors. But, oh well.
This movie actually turned out pretty decent. The beginning was in my opinion the best part. It was truly horrifying to watch as the chaos unfolded. The story is losely based on the original with the same idea of survivors trapped in a shopping mall by hundreds of zombies as an epidemic grips the country *and possibly world?* That's basicly where the simularities end...although some of the original catch-phrases from the 70's film are also used in this.
Overall, it was a very good horror picture. It has a decent amount of gore [although I think the original tops it, even if the effects were not as good.] Some of the characters are likable, while other are loathsome and you want to feed them to teh zombies yourself! The zombies are also decently effective. For horror movie buffs, this is a new moderen classic right up there.(...) Highly recommended.",1081036800,,1192,4.654028436018957
2066676,4,B00027SIUK,"What makes a good horror movie? Is it great special effects, horrific monsters, mood setting music, or a tense plot full of surprises? Yes, these are all key elements, but to me it takes believable, average human characters with a real sense of jeopardy and a few human characters that we want to see eaten alive. In this latest zombie flick the humans in jeopardy do drive this story, but is it enough. For me it was. The movie opens with a bang, not worrying to develop the characters they are immediately placed into a harrowing situation, with little explanation. As the tension builds and the last few survivors hole up in an area mole, the true characters of the victims are put on display. Ving Rhames does an excellent job as the strong silent protector, and Sarah Polley is very believable as the subtle heart of the tale.  These characters really drive this picture. Most of the other characters are thinly drawn stereotypical horror archetypes, but have just enough depth to keep the picture on track.
  As with most zombie flicks there is plenty of action and gore. Also added to that is high level of human ingenuity when the trapped mall rats go A-Team and put together an armored bus in a last attempt to gain some level of control over the rest of their loves. For me, the icing on this guilty pleasure comes after the credit roles and we get a glimpse into the remaining existence of the remaining survivors.",1080950400,,1425,4.602362204724409
2066677,5,B00027SIUK,"Okay, so you want to see a horror movie that has lots of gore, violence, morbidity, the obligitory sex scene and of course, monsters aplenty?  Then this is your film.  Taking it one step further are believable performances by some of Hollywood's ""A"" List actors in a remake of a ""B"" movie.
Mehki Pfeifer and Ving Rhames lead the cast in this remake of the Romero classic ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Carrying the same title, this film not only pays homage to the original film, it goes a step further and stands alone as a comically adapted depiction of the world run foul when zombies begin to walk the earth, looking to devour human flesh as they do so.  Our unfortunate survivors find themselves couped up in a shopping mall which serves as a near ideal fortress to ward off the multitudes of mindless creatures who cascade the parking lot looking for victims.
For anyone looking for an insightful or engaging view of the end times, this movie is not your bag...but it is a fun and terrifying romp through a world of absolute horror.  The director of this film carefully balances in-you-face gore with a comedic timing and wit that will leave the audiences reeling from the high pace-high intensity feel of this film.
The special effects and the casting of hundreds of extras gives this film a much more real feel than the 1978 original, and the gore that is served up is unending, from shotguns blowing heads off to chainsaws hacking and slicing through zombie and living human alike, this film has enough blood and guts to give even the most die hard horror fan an eyeful.
For those who are sensitive to violent depictions of gore, obviously this film isn't for you.  It is definitely NOT a film for children, or, to that end, anyone under the 17 age limit set on it by the R rating it received.  In this instance, the rating is more than appropriate.  However, this is a fun, frightening film that will be ideal for first dates who are looking to cozy up in the theater....it has a thread of character development, but again, this is a roller coaster ride...deigned for thrills, not intelligent thought.

Not only a remake, but almost an entirely new movie loosly based on the 78 flick dotd.  I was giddy with joy at the nods twords the original and morbid humor.  I very much enjoyed the new running zombies, i found it to be very creepy because if you see one of those coming at you, you don't have much of a chance.  I liked the old one because they weren't bad one on one but when there was 50 of them you were screwed and guarenteed a slow death.  I am also very glad that the film stayed with the happy music that they had in the original.  I beg fans of the original (like me) that please just go see this movie with an open mind.

Although some might see this film as the coming of the rapture, it's actually just a horror film with some fairly interesting characters and a terrible ending (not sure you could even call it an ending)!  Hey!  Maybe it IS a review of 'The Passion.'  But I digress 2000 years...
An Emergency Room nurse goes home one evening to her husband where they make mad, passionate love (I mean come on! What would a horror film be without a little nookie?).  When they awake the following morning from their post-coital stupor, the husband finds the neighbor child wheezing strangely in their bedroom doorway.  She quickly takes a bite out of the husband then tries for our nurse heroine.  The husband quickly joins the undead and goes after his wife now, too.  Once our nurse escapes and get's outside, she discovers that the world has gone crazy; houses are on fire, zombies run (and I mean they RUN!) down the streets, cars are toppled over.  Hell has arrived on Earth.
Our nurse escapes to a local shopping mall with a band of other 'normal' humans where they barricade themselves inside.  The interactions of the characters inside are what kept the movie going here, not the occasional foray into the outer world where the zombies have begun to congregate.  Say, why ARE they congregating outside the mall?  This is never truly explained.  Plot hole?  Definitely.
Needless to say, some of our mall human survivors don't make it and some do.  They make a dash for the marina in an attempt to get aboard a ship and sail to a deserted island.  Do they make it?  You'll have to watch it and see.
The ending:  As we left the theater, my teenage daughter turned to me and said, ""That ending sucked!  It was too Titanicy.""  I tend to agree with her observation.

2066682,3,B00027SIUK,"STORY: Ah, zombies. George A. Romero started this genre back in 1968 with 'Night Of The Living Dead'. His little trilogy spawned hundreds of similar like movies and even created a video game phenomenon. Let's look at zombies, the central idea behind them. The living dead is a frightening subject. Think about it, other human's walking and eating others, while dead! The idea of ""zombies"" without a doubt came from an actual human practice, cannibalism. This is why it is so frightening, at least the idea of it. The movie on the other hand while it does provide its jumps and jolts does not provide ""out of your seat"" moments.  I did enjoy some of those tense moments though that build up, but was disappointed when they led nowhere! I was expecting a big jolt with a dash of loud music to accompany it but, nope! The movie is entertaining though, and is worth a look at. The original is a classic because it utilized a satirical undertone to the story, and while this movie tries to capture these contemporary satires of human behavior it fails and all we get are a few cheap laughs that feel forced. Yes, the movie does try to use humor but it's literal, not like the original where the humor was more non-direct. I'll tell you though, for first time director Zack Snyder, this movie was not a bad effort.  It has style all over it.  It's just in the end it turns out cliched, and unfortunately does not close the story, so expect a sequel or pre-quel if this one gets a good turnout at the box office.
ACTING: The cast is very well put together and they balance each other out. The cast is likeable because it's not composed of dumbfounded teens with chiseled facial features and bouncy breasts in tight tees. Ving Rhames is probably the only person average moviegoers will recognize, and he is the strong point in the ensemble, but in the end the cast's connection is weak.  Mekhi Phifer's relationship with his pregnant wife is horrible because the audience sees no emotion between them, and in the end you feel that he was just using her for incubation. Fun cast, no emotional connection, but looking at them individually will show more strengths rather than looking at them as an ensemble, which is really what the script should of focused on.
BOTTOM LINE: I was only pleased because this movie captivated more suspense than action. I'm a big Resident Evil fan, and I know where the game got its creepy claustrophobic environments, creepy music, great characters, and zombie madness from . . . this movie (the original). The film adaptation of Resident Evil was just action madness, this movie is a big improvement that I wish Resident Evil had. I would also like to see `28 Days Later' and compare, because I heard that was more of a sophisticated horror film rather than one aimed at teens, which this one surely is. The original movie was a classic in the same way that `Kill Bill' will become one. A movie that was shockingly gory and fruitless to a point where it's satire. The remake tried to take itself too seriously and try to be too funny at the same time, big mistake. Also, the zombies in this movie were able to run, jump, climb, and do many other physical actions. Zombies are ""brainless"" beings, they moan, not hiss and growl, they limp around, not sprint, and they cannot think. The zombies in this movie are some kind of hybrid, an ugly one. I like the zombies you find in Resident Evil games, you think of them as harmless stupid things, but yet they are frightening. See this one for a good time, not for a good movie.",1080691200,,3545,4.551724137931035

While the new DOTD 2004 does have it's differences from the original, the essence is still the same.  I downloaded the trailer as soon as it was available, and have been drooling in anticipation until I finally suckered my girlfriend into going with me.  Ladies and gentlemen, do not cheat yourselves of an awesome movie going experience.  This movie has that sick humor (you know, the kind that just makes you scream laughing just to break the mood of how scary it is), and suspense to have you screaming until the very end, and I do mean the very end.  This version has obviously been modernized and does have different elements: yes, the zombies are faster.  Is this a bad thing?  For those die-hard zombie heads who seem to accept nothing but the purist of the pure of their undead cinema, this might upset you.  I don't really know why, because I am a zombie movie fan, and even though it breaks from the traditional concept of what a zombie is, it is just (if not more) terrifying in it's own sense.  What slow-zombie fans find scary about the not-so-fast, is not actually fear of the zombies themselves, but the eerie, uncomfortable feel of something once dead, moving and lurching with no soul and only a desire to feed....on you. The numbers of these soulless machines moaning and grunting.  While the 'new' zombies have more of a feel that a vampire, or an animal would have, that eerieness is still there, especially due to the fantastic makeup job done by the crew.  You still have mangled limbs, and open pus-y wounds.  The faces are still frightning from the slices cuts of the skin, to the glazed over pale lifeless eyes, to the bad Austin Powers-ish teeth.  There are gonna be some scenes that will just make you squirm, there's scenes that will make you chuckle, and there is scenes that will make you just scream [...]  Don't deprive yourself of this great experience, you will not be disappointed.  You don't have to be a zombie fan to appreciate this movie.  If you like having the bejeezes scared out of you then this movie is for you.  There hasn't been a movie since the Shining (the original mind you, I wouldn't dare mention the futile attemp of a remake) that has made me stop moving and breathing when I hear a strange noise when I'm all alone at home.

2066686,3,B00027SIUK,"How do you remake a film that has become a cult classic?
Well, apparently you just do.  And you do it up sort of like the original and sort of exactly opposite the original.  What do I mean?
The action largely takes place in a shopping mall, just like the original film.  The characters must learn to live there and make it their home.  So that makes it ""sort of like the original"".  However, it is there that the similarities end.  In the original film, we had the sense of time passing, that the characters had been there a long time.  In this remake, that isn't the case.  You don't know if they've been there one day or one year.  No mention is ever made.  In the original, there was an emotional reaction to the horrors going on outside.  In the remake, there is but a brief moment where Sarah Polley has a slight cry and that's pretty much it - no one talks about it ever again.  It's as if zombies are something of a pain in the neck and the loss of the character's families is never discussed.
Now, how is it exactly the opposite of the original?  In the original the zombies were slow, lumbering creatures obviously suffering from rigamortis.  In the remake, they are lightning quick - even one morbidly obese who, in life, could never have been that quick.
In the original, we had the false new society (the characters set up in the mall) breached by the bikers thus allowing the zombies into their midst.  In the sequel its one of their own going outside who does the trick.  This works.  However, there is a single problem with it.  The remaining plot hinges on a stray dog.  A dog that in the course of apparent hours they have trained to perform an action that would quite obviously take days or months even under the best of conditions.
Now, granted, I'm not the target audience for this film.  I was the target audience of the first film when it was released in 1979 (actually I was underaged back then).  But, curiosity got the best of me so I wanted to see this one.  Oh, it's gory and it's scary - in a ""jump out at you"" sort of way.  This may be a GenYer's Dawn of the Dead, but it isn't mine.  It's definitely got a lot more action and moves a lot faster than the original, but I'll take story to action any day of the week.",1080604800,,2245,4.252955082742317
2066687,4,B00027SIUK,"Okay I saw this film the first day it came out. And let me say I saw it souly because I wanted to see how a remake would measure up to one of my all time favorite films George A. Romero's Dawn of the dead (1978. Well I walked out of the movie with a frown on one side of my face and a smile on the other. The movie was good and I'm happy to report its defintly not really a remake at all as you all most likely know. Yes, it has the same title (to make more money), yes it has a mall, and yes it has zombies! Oh and thats about it but otherwise its completly different. And here is why:
1.) The characters are weak and undeveloped in this
2.) The zombies run (which  is crap, Zombies are not any scarier if they run and truthfully if someone came back to life they would not run while their body is decompoising, THEY'D LOSE A LEG THAT WAY!)
3.) Virtually all intelligentance, subtext, and commentary is missing (No surprise really it was written by the writer of Troma's war...blah)
4.) This is more of a thriller than a zombie film (WHERE IS THE GORE?!) There is no flesheating to be found here except for the first ten minutes and probably like four head shots. The only decent gore was the surprise chainsaw scene which I loved! And the baby scene was quite disgusting...kinda retarded though (why didn't the baby do anything!) But in comparison with the original this thing is tame, like a disney movie. The original had a head shot a second, a graphic intestine pulling, arms ripped-off, limbs being eaten, people being nastily bitten and plenty more gore. SO YES the zombies do look better with a bigger budget but it is kind of ironic that an old movie is actually more violent than a new updated version hmmm?
5.)EVERYTHING ELSE.
I liked this movie souly because it knew it wasn't a remake and didn't try to beat the old one like other remakes do (I'm looking at you awful TCM remake yep :wink:) So yes this movie is good for a dumb little entertaining pop-corn flick.

2066691,3,B00027SIUK,"When George Romero directed THE NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in 1968, he showed a horrific underside to human bestiality that has not been equaled since.  In his sequels, DAWN OF and DAY OF, he shifted philosophical gears to taking a searing poke at excess consumerism.  For some reason, he has felt the need to remake THE NIGHT OF in 1990, and now continues his remake trilogy with DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004).  In DAWN's second go round, he allows Jack Snyder to take over the director's helm, and Snyder takes a screenplay by James Gunn to highlight an anarchic world that is neither as blankly scary as the original NIGHT OF nor as satirical as the first DAWN OF.  In all the previous 'dead' films, the zombies were stiff-legged walking corpses who were quite scary in their collective way.  As individuals, they were weak, plodding, and ravenous for human flesh.  As attacking waves of dead flesh, they were irresistible.  Here, director Snyder alters the basic script by morphing the plodding zombies into lightning-quick track stars who are possessed with incredible strength.  There is a tendency to compare this DAWN with the recent 28 DAYS.  In this latter film, the zombies are filmed in the same surreal and rapid style of camera work that is used in DAWN OF THE DEAD.  Such a style, however, tends to lessen, rather than increase the sense of horror that you think would result from reanimated corpses.  George Romero had the right idea in his original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  There was something infinitely mesmerizing about Romero's stiff-jointed zombies that is lacking in Snyder's more mercurial versions.
There is no rationale, of course, than can credibly account for the reanimation of dead human beings, although Romero tried in 1968 to tie in the return of a space probe that was infected with alien microbes as a possible source of infection.  In this DAWN, there is no explanation given.  You are simply presented with a massive, possibly universal, return of the dead to the world of the living.  The movie opens with a few false starts.  A hospital doctor and nurse attempt to locate a missing patient.  The nurse goes home to find that her daughter has died, has returned to life, and now kills her husband, who quickly returns himself to attack her.  The plot involves the nurse (Sarah Polley) gradually joining a small group of human survivors who take refuge in a shopping mall.  Ving Rhames is a police officer who provides both muscle and leadership as he attempts to keep his band unbitten.  Most of the second half is interesting mostly in how the survivors relate to each other rather than in how they fend off the unceasing tidal waves of attacking zombies.  The film presents a significant subtext in the need for quarreling human beings to co-operate in the face of a common enemy.  There is no way to satisfactorily end such a film, nor does director Snyder attempt to do so.  What he succeeds in is his cinematic roller coaster of a ride that effectively takes the audience through a nightmare that, despite the inherent illogic of the premise, is no less unsettling for that.  Sure to follow is the next remake of the final of the trilogy, DAY OF.",1080345600,2,3183,4.73502722323049

Unfortunatly, the movie wasn't as good as the previews led me to believe...
This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was hoping for a really cool zombie movie with a somewhat realistic end of the world scenario. Instead I was treated to a bad comedy! The actors sucked, the jokes sucked, the storyline sucked and never tied together well...
What annoyed me the most is how this movie wants you to take it seriously, but how can you with such bad writting. For example, people would rather play chess then prepare to kill zombies. Or a girl risk her life saving a dog(which is safe from the zombies anyway), instead of staying with her boyfriend...
The worst part is the end.... there wasn't one! When the credits came up I wanted to leave so bad, but the director punishes you by making you watch the movie ending in between the ending credits. This was the worst ending I have ever seen in my life...
I know many zombie fans will not be happy with my review, but lets try to be non bias... this one was crap! When godzilla fans rubber stamp bad movies, we get more bad godzilla movies... When we constantly rubber stamp bad Halloween Micheal Myers films, we get films like resurection... Zombie fans, please don't be a victim of the rubber stamp.... demand better!

This movie was execellent.  The first ten minutes were the stuff that great horror movies are made of.  I was afraid that after such a great beginning the movie would die down, but it kept me entertained from beginning to end. The acting was great (we all know this is rare in horror films), the script was great, it was just the right amount of blood and gore, what more can you ask for?  Although I am a fan of the original, I found the running zombies to be a hell of a lot more scary than Ramero's.  Overall the movie was excellent.

2066697,5,B00027SIUK,"Over the past few years the Horror genre has taken a huge blow in that there have been nothing but sequels (Freddy vs Jason) or parodies (Scream, Idle hands).  The horror genre seemed doomed to monotinism, until now.
Dawn of the Dead is a remake of sorts of the 1970's classic that George Romero directed.  The story here is that a group of strangers are trapped in a mall while the earth is being over run by zombies.  The will to survive takes a beating as the zombies don't give up on the poor souls.  One by one the people start to get more and more edgy as the thought that if even one of those things got in it could spell the end of them all.
What makes this movie so great is not the gore or insane violence, but the atmosphere and actual focus on character development.  No single individual in this movie is in any way cattle fodder for the flesh eating zombies.  Each of these people have feelings, have lost some one they loved, and are genuinly terrorfied.
Over all this movie, along with Texas Chainsaw Remake and House of 1000 corpses, leave hope that the horror genere is not dead, just witing for the right opportunity to strike.",1080259200,,1146,4.356807511737089
2066699,1,B00027SIUK,"It's difficult to give a review of a film that's just spent a couple of hours spitting in your face and telling you there's no hope, other than to say: message understood. The pregnancy story line was particularly cynical.
The photography was the usual 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigations' garishness that's currently in vogue, and I wish it wasn't.
Character action was jarring. The young security guard and the girl who liked the dog seem to have become an item at one point, but God knows when. Editing is frustrating and counterproductive. There was a particularly odd jump cut when they left the gun shop.
Ultimately, George Romero just had that indefinable auteur ability to give his original an inner life. He makes you interested in his characters and has an earthy, blue collar sensibility. Deciding against a bleak ending, the final lines of Romero's film make the picture.
This remake is strictly business.",1080259200,8,914,4.980392156862745
2066700,4,B00027SIUK,"I can't give the film 5 stars because it's no SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or CITIZEN KANE.  Also, it gets docked because the original idea came from George Romero, and these filmmakers are putting thier own spin on it.  But other than that...this movie delivers chills, thrills and more than a few solid laughs.
I'm a fan of the original, but I haven't seen it in years.  Of course, the special effects in the original weren't so great compared to what we can do today (or frankly, to what Romero did in DAY OF THE DEAD), but I actually remember the original being grosser.  When the zombies caught someone in the original, we got to see disembowlings and lots of chewing on flesh.  YUMMY!!  In the new movie, there isn't time to dwell on it so much. It moves at a brisker pace than the rather long original (it was nearly 2.5 hours if I remember, compared to 100 minutes or so now).
Anyway, surely you know the basic plot by now! Flesh-eating zombies are rising from the grave and making more zombies faster than you can say ""nuclear holocaust.""  They can only be killed by a shot right through the brain (or perhaps being burned completely) but most people are killed before they have a chance to even try killing the zombies.  A few survivors make their way to a shopping mall, and barracade themselves inside.  The zombies are constantly threatening, but as is often the case in such films, the bickering and power-struggles of the survivors are nearly as dangerous.  Who will live?  That's the ultimate question.
The important thing in movies where we take a large cast and kill them off one by one (ALIENS...good,  DEEP BLUE SEA...not so good) is that we learn to care somewhat about the characters. And the movie has VERY little time to sketch the characters, so they have to handle it well.  DAWN OF THE DEAD handles it very well.  Each person is given sharply drawn characteristics, and just enough complexity that we immediately throw our allegiances their way.  Even the ""bad guys"" have their moments.  In the end, we hate to see ANY humans, even the nasty ones, succumb to a zombie.  And most of the characters get at least one good laugh to their name...so we like them for that!
The nominal ""lead actor"" in the film is Sarah Polley, a nurse, who is the only one of the band of survivors that we meet BEFORE the zombies take over. In a brief, maybe 10 minute, opening, we see her at work, coming home to her suburban town and cuddling with her husband. All around her, little clues about the brewing trouble are being dropped, but we also see very easily how she could be missing them...so imagine her surprise to wake up in the morning to find the world she has known is gone forever.
Polley is a good actor who has never gotten big Hollywood recognition because she isn't a traditional beauty.  But, much like in the original DEAD movies, there aren't really any pretty faces in these films.  The aestetic is to give us BELIEVABLE looking people...people we might see on the street.  US!!!
Ving Rhames is the other ""big"" name, along with ER's Mekhi Phifer.  But being a ""name"" in this movie is no guarantee of making it to the end.
Part of the fun is guessing who's next to go.  And just about every death is different than any other, so that we get to ""experience"" each loss.  Thus, the movie is brutal, but it feels a bit human too.
The action scenes are all tense and well-executed.  And the biggest success of all:  no moments where you say to yourself, ""Oh, come on, NO ONE WOULD DO THAT!!!""  There is one case where one of the characters does something VERY foolhardy on her own (involving chasing a dog) but by then, we KNOW that she is a person living on the edge of sanity as it is, so we buy her doing something stupid (which she doesn't pay the ultimate price for anyway).  Otherwise, these are desparate people, often forced to do insane things because they have no choice...not because they made stupid choices.
I really enjoyed myself at this film, and if you're a fan of in-your-face horror, you MUST check it out.  It's nice to know that this kind of movie can still be made so well.  With 28 DAYS LATER and now this great remake...it's been a good couple of years!",1080172800,,4188,4.473684210526316
2066701,5,B00027SIUK,"I am a fan of the original 1979 Dawn of the dead, and when I went to see this remake I was nearly sure that it was going to be a disappointment. Well, was I wrong. This is a GREAT movie, the chaos and breakdown of society is shown in a much fuller way than the original film and the movie never really let you tabe a break. The make up, action, suspense and anxiety factor are right up there, as well as the soundtrack been also very well matched to the movie. It is not a perfect film, but it is way better than I expected, I would even say that I enjoyed it better than the original. One important thign that you should know; Do not get up and walk out as soon as the end credits starts rolling, there is more of the story unfolding in between the pages of credits and will change the end of the movie completely. Overall: EXCELLENT!",1080172800,,835,4.066666666666666
2066702,4,B00027SIUK,"I went into this flick keeping my expectations at a low-boil because (a) I love George Romero's first two flesh-eating zombie classics, and (b) I am always more impressed when somebody can make a great movie with a small pocketful of money than I am with somebody who can make a good movie with a mondo-budget. The original Dawn of the Dead was one of those rare classic low budget horror films, and all the money in Warren Buffet's bank account could never make a cooler ""Dawn of the Dead.""
That said, I must give director Zack Snyder and the cast of the remake credit for making an excellent remake loosely based on the 1978 version. Absent is the classic tenement shootout, gone are the marauding band of bikers, and the new zombies run ---instead of lurch--- toward their kill. And you could never duplicate the chemistry of the foursome that hid in that ""indoor shopping mall"" back in '78.
This version starts off in high gear, and never lets up. It opens up with a couple going through their day in a normal world and, without warning, waking up to a record time epidemic, their neighborhood teeming with carniverous zombies, and neighbors who are equally confused and terrified.
There is a much larger crew of people who become holed up in the shopping mall this time around, lead by the alpha-male in Ving Rhames. I think it was wise of the folks who made this films not to recreate the ""George Romero aura,"" but still retaining the same creep-out and intensity level. Clever zombie solutions and escape plans evolve. There is great fun with the comraderie between the shopping mall inhabitants and a Andy the Gun Store Owner across the street; both sides perched on their respective rooftops, they writes messages to each other on large easels, and pass the time inventing fun games; it's especially funny when, looking at the zombies on the street below, they play a game of ""celebrity zombie.""
Another hep treat for Romero fans are cameos by two of the stars in the original movie: Scott Reiniger, and Ken Foree, who repeats the line he was famous for in 1978! Ken Foree's role may be brief, but he is one of those few hepcats who exudes ""cool"" just by his presence! He is one underrated performer, in my opinion.
This ""Dawn of the Dead"" may not have the George Romero look to it; in my opinion, no zombie flick will match ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the first ""Dawn of the Dead."" But this take on the hungry zombie in modern America is still excellent!",1080172800,2,2467,4.583710407239819
2066703,4,B00027SIUK,"This is it folks.  This is NOT really a remake, but a revisioning of the original George Romero masterpiece (also available on DVD and in my collection!).  This is a modern retelling of a classic adult dark fairytale.  When the bogey man shuffles against the front window for an adult, it's not a troll, it's a zombie.  I've got children of my own now, and like all dads, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm worried about what the world will be like for my two little kids when they grow up.  Let's just hope like hell it's not full of flesh eating zombies.
I'd been marking off my calendar till the March 19th release of this film.  I had a lot of hopes wrapped up in this movie.  It's because there hasn't really been a scary horror film in years.  ""28 Days Later"" touched around the edges, but afterall, that's not really a zombie picture; that's a biological catastrophe out of control picture.  And while I liked the suspense in the film, I was still hungry for a true zombie film.  ""House of the Dead"" was such a disappointment, that I figured this, too, would be nothing more than a Hollywood Z-grade pot full of mish-mash.  The true zombie picture (as only George Romero and the one picture made by Fulci (Zombie 2) have been able to accomplish) taps right into the adult nightmare of a train ride to Armageddon.  You want (just like the film characters) to be able to step off the train, to find out it's all just a nightmare and all the people you love and the things you care about are still okay.  But, this train is hurtling down the tracks, and it's going full speed towards the end.  The end of all mankind.
Romero was able to engage us with realistic characters who we could empathise with and root for.  At the same time, we wanted violent gore to explode on the screen, showing us how lucky we are that none of this could really happen.  Zombie movie fans are a funny group (yours truly included).  We're like curious kids sneaking a peak into the sideshow freak tent.  We want to see something truly horrible, perhaps even awe inspiring; a glimpse of real Hell on earth.  But we want to be able to step back and feel relief after it's all over.  We want the world to get very close to the edge of extinction, even if some of us don't want it to literally go over the edge.
This movie, while hampered by some obvious plot holes (if the heroes have broken into the locked mall, why aren't the zombies following them in through the same broken open doorway?  And who the hell - except my own dear daughter - is going to chase after their dog in a mess of hungry zombies!), comes very close to being a modern classic in the zombie movie arena.  Ving Rhames brings a lot of class and legitimacy to the film.  Sarah Polley is very believable as the frightened, remorseful female lead that we identify with as the every-person victim trying to cope.  Jake Weber was perfect as a level-headed man trying to adhere the group together in the midst of chaos.  In fact, I found myself liking all the characters (C.J., Andy, the woman truck driver) in this movie (with the exception of Steve, and the zombie-lunch-box security guard who is devoured in the sub-basement...but then we were supposed to dislike them, they were examples of the self-centered civilization that was now becoming extinct).
This is a sleek, fast-paced horror film, with plenty of moments of tension and plenty of gore.  And like the original, I find myself days later still thinking about this tasty little gem of grue.  Sometimes, I think about it in the middle of the night.",1080172800,,3568,4.449230769230769
2066704,5,B00027SIUK,"There are very few zombie flicks that can be considered great, and this is one of them.  A faithful fan to Romero trilogy, I was not for one second disappointed with this movie.  Everyone knows the story, people trapped in a mall while the living dead overrun the world outside.  That is where the similarity to the original ""Dawn"" ends.  I was glad to see it wasn't just the exact same movie with better special effects, as the remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"" was.  There was plenty of surprises, and I was literally on the edge of my seat, heart pounding the entire movie.
I'm only seventeen, so I consider Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" the best zombie movie, if not best horror movie, of my lifetime.  I can't necessarily say it was better than the original, but it was still excellent.  A big improvement over the opening round of twenty-first century zombie movies, especially ""28 Days Later"" and ""House of the Dead"".  But I am glad they decided to go with 28 Days' vicious running zombies, rather than the shuffling blue-faced zombies we have all come to love.
Dawn of the Dead never fails to deliver terrifying action and hilarious horror.  This is also one of the best portrayals of character isolation I've seen.  I'm also glad it didn't try to ""explain"" where the zombie plague came from.  When they do it's usually a disappointment, so it's better they leave you hanging.  This is an awesome film, one of the best zombie flicks ever(and I've seen quite a few of them).  Of course there's going to be the usual crowd of skeptics who find something wrong with everything that's not ""Shakespeare in Love"".  And of course people will read this and say ""he's just a kid, what does he know?"".  Well it's because I'm a kid that I'm so familiar with horror movies.  If you like having fun while being scared, just ignore what everyone says and go see Dawn without a second thought.",1080172800,,1892,4.553254437869822
2066705,5,B00027SIUK,"The new DAWN OF THE DEAD (from the writer of the first SCOOBY-DOO movie!) is one rockin' remake! Like the 1990 version of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAWN takes its own approach to the material yet evokes the scares and thrills of the original. Done in the vein of 28 DAYS LATER, with fast zombies, DAWN OF THE DEAD is a true blockbuster in every sense of the word. However, it just doesn't compare to the original DAWN in terms of story and character development, but hey, what did you expect from a remake?
This new version lacks the satire on consumerism and mall culture of the original, which was the strongest point. But it is fun to see a store in a mall named after Gaylen Ross, who played Fran in the original, and the scene where one guy shoots zombies who look like celebrities like Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds, just to name a few, was the funniest scene. ... As for the security guards, CJ, the head security guard, reminds me of Captain Rhodes from DAY OF THE DEAD; in fact, the early scenes when the survivors run into these guards remind me of the original script for DAY, which I took the time to read, thank you very much.
Yet this remake has so much going for it that it's unfair to criticize it against the original. There is so much tension in the atmosphere at the mall and I was scared during several scenes when either the zombies attacked or one of the survivors became a zombie. And there is a great level of excitement that any ""blockbuster"" tries to create that is generated in the last act when the survivors try to escape from the mall. Also, there is fan service for those who are familiar with the original, like me; in addition to the Gaylen Ross store, television broadcasts in the mall feature Tom Savini as a cop in an interview, David Emge (Stephen/Flyboy) as a reporter, and Ken Foree (Peter) as a televangelist who delivers that trademark line from DAWN. Best of all, this new version has some totally rockin' gore scenes, not bad for an R-rated movie!
Therefore, the new DAWN OF THE DEAD, while not the same awesome movie that the original was (get the newest DVD release), is a totally awesome horror movie on its own terms. This remake is more than capable of generating its own thrills, laughs, and excitement. This will be a rollercoaster ride for those new to DAWN (i.e. haven't seen the original yet) and a treat for fans of the original. But by all means, you must see the original DAWN OF THE DEAD a few times in order to understand the aforementioned in-jokes and cameos. Also, check out 28 DAYS LATER, the best horror film to come along in years, to understand where this new version is going. Either way, get ready to chow down on one hell of a horror blockbuster!

I also love the chase scenes and the comedy of the characters. I felt caught up in the movie from the beginning till the end. I didn't want it to end.,1080086400,,277,3.8771929824561404
2066707,4,B00027SIUK,"The first ten minutes of this remake of George A. Romero's Dawn of the dead should have been flaunted on television as it was on the Monday before it's opening on the USA network. What an amazing start, few times am I moved by actions or horrors, (as this is both) but the sheer power and fear generated by this opening sequence is what sets the stage for this film. It is all down hill from there but the film does manage to do what few remakes do, and that is stand on it's own as a decent movie overall.

The original Dawn of the Dead kept the zombies in slow motion but never turned away when they got a victim pinned down and the remake doesn't even come close to the violence or pure horror of the original (nothing does, it's one of the greatest horror films ever made).  It does however remain a suspenseful action/horror film that has you rooting for the good guys...and sometimes the zombies.  It is entertaining despite it's flaws.  Director Zack Snyder has a tremendous amount of mainstream appeal.  All of the film's outstanding strengths are directorial in nature.  The cast was also strong.  Ving Rhames revisits his type castings here but is enjoyable despite being written inconsistently.  Sarah Polley breaks her independant film mold and chooses a strange film to do so.  She is a good screamer (albeit very cliche) character.  She pulls it off well enough to conveniently veil the film's writing flaws.  The film has a decent cast in the forefront but drops off big time from there.  You will see the screenplay's very worst lines delivered the way they would be delivered in a Sleepaway Camp film.

Speaking of the screenplay, it is the only real stand-out problem.  Dawn of the Dead is unique in that the screenplay is really sort of bunched up in bad dialogue and cheap copied ideas from bad movies, but it is forgiven for the most part by it's surprising aforementioned strengths.  We go by the action/horror film book page by page in this film but it manages to come off as different because of the new zombies we have, compliments to the mainstream success of the remarkably refreshing 28 Days Later.  I will admit laughing out loud at least a half dozen times at some one liners and busting a gut at the celebrity shooting scene on the roof of the mall.  You will too but if you plan on taking this remake seriously you may feel guilty about it.

So how does it compare to the original?  Well, Snyder and company played it safe and made a very different film with fast zombies, no consistent or obvious social commentary, a wider and more diluted cast and some very fancy and super cool action shots.  It's colorful, it's packed with explosions, blood and  shooting; it's creepy and the zombies are almost as much fun as they were in Return of the Living Dead.  Unfortunately it sacrifices the depth and sheer terror of the original so it simply cannot be compared.

All in all the film's flaws can be ignored because this film worked for me.",1080086400,16,2969,4.549905838041432
2066708,5,B00027SIUK,"Let me start this review off by saying that I am a fan of the original Dawn of The Dead (1979). No other zombie movie could top this (except maybe Night of The Living Dead, which was the directed by the same director of the original Dawn of The Dead, George A. Romero), espically what it carried with it, which was character development... I cared a lot for the characters in the original Dawn of The Dead, making you feel like you've known them, and hoping they will escape the horror that they had to deal with: ZOMBIES!
BUT, this review isn't about the original Dawn of The Dead... Its about the ""remake"". ""Remake"" is a pretty harsh word to use when describing the 2004 version of Dawn of The Dead, and I gotta tell you all.... This is not a ""remake"". The only thing that the new Dawn of The Dead uses from the original is: 1)The mall idea (get this, the mall in the 2004 version isn't even the same as the original), and of course, 2)ZOMBIES! Everything else has changed. The story now doesnt focus on just 4 people like the original did. There's now, at the least, 8 characters (there may be more) who are all carried out great by well known actors/actresses such as Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction, Con Air), Sarah Polley (Go, Love Come Down), Jake Weber (Pushing Tin, U-571) and Mekhi Phifer (8 Mile, Honey), and then not-so-well-known actors/actresses like (well..... you probabily wouldnt know them). The character development isn't as good as the original, mainly because of the larger number of characters in the movie (the original had 4 characters total, making it a lot easier to get to know all the characters), and possibly because of the writer (even though I would say that he has done a pretty good job), but it holds well and by the middle of the movie, you should start to care about certain characters, or all of them. The director has changed from George A. Romero to Zack Snyder who, I think, has done a fantastic job in bringing back some of the good ol' horror from the Dead series (Night of The Living Dead, Dawn of The Dead, and Day of The Dead)
The original Dawn of The Dead stood out and was well known for its comedy and dark humor, the dialogue was pretty funny and not cheesy at all. Does the new Dawn of The Dead have this spark that the original has? Yes, in a way. It may not have had AS MUCH comedy and dark humor as the original, but it stands up pretty well to it. The funniest dark humor from the new Dawn of The Dead had to be the ""sniping selected zombies"" scene (which I will not give away, for that will ruin it totally cause you GOTTA see this scene), and a couple parts in the dialogue had a couple laughs.
Anyway, in Dawn of The Dead, the survivors of a worldwide plague have taken refuge in a large mall, while on the outside, flesh eating zombies roam the land, infecting others who haven't turned, creating the zombie population to multiply greatly. When the zombies outside draw their attention to the mall occupied by the survivors, chaos starts and the survivors have to find a way to get out without becoming one of the zombies..... or a human sandwich.
For some reason, I feel that the zombies in this version of Dawn of The Dead were a lot faster and more aggressive than the ones in the original. Because of this, it creates more of a ""tense"" feel to it, as the characters are always on the move, running as fast as they can from these running zombies. Also, this movie doesnt use CGI much at all. Like the original, this one uses the classic make-up and costume stuff, which I think is a lot better than the fake CGI crap that fills in the screen in other movies. Now days, its kind of rare and unique to see a movie use the good ol' make-up and costume effects, and it makes the ride even creepier and scarier, giving a slight disturbing feel to it.
The gore is pretty high, though not as much as the original Dawn of The Dead. It basically holds well, though, insuring that gore lovers will have a feast with this... So, is it worth the bucks to see it on the big screen? I would say so! Remake? No. A great movie? YES.
Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality.",1080086400,,4152,4.3587096774193546
2066719,3,B00027SIUK,"This remake to the George Romero 1978 follow up of ""Night of the Living Dead"" is decent a horrorfest, but, seems to stroll down familiar territory old, as well as, new.
  With the night of the living dead fading in the new morning light, a nurse awakens in her home, and experienes the dawn of the dead as she fends off her husband and daughter, after both have changed unexplainablly into blood thirsty, flesh eating, monsters. It seems that overnight a virus has been unleashed in the small Milwaukee town where the nurse lives and basically its every man, woman, and child for themselves, turning the average citizen into a flesh eating killer (once bitten by another zombie,that is). The nurse hooks up with a cop, and a small gaggle of survivors and decide to wait it out in the town mall until, hopefully, help arrives (but, don't hold your breath, though, this is a zombie movie).
  The film is a bit disturbing (there are images of families  killing one another, a school bus full of kids eating each other, suburban chaos, etc.). These zombies aren't accustomed to do the ""Curly Shuffle"" as traditionally in Romero's ""Dead"" films. These zombies haul serious ass! The makeup is disturbing, with graying skin, and icy glazed eyes. The SFX are updated and tight. Especially, when the survivors make a break from there mall prison (makes you feel sorry for Custer when he had his last stand!).
  The film does have some faults. The film isn't groundbreaking or, for me, personally, scary. ""Universal Pictures"" and ""USA Cable Network"" preveiwed the first ten minutes of ""Dawn of the Dead"" the Monday before its release in theatres, on ""USA"". It killed the opening of the film for me (the most suspenseful scene of the movie was in its opening moments and it was ruined for me, because I watched it before hand, and on T.V. no less, dimininshing the shock value). The film is to reminiscent of ""28 Days Later"" (the sprinting zombies are a bit more frightening here, but, don't underestimate the monsters in ""Dawn"", either). It makes me wonder if ""Universal"" didn't green light this film, in hopes of riding on ""Days"" coattails. ""28 Days Later is a British film that was released in the fall of 2002 with a, surprisingly, auspicious American debut in June of 2003. Usually, American studios don't sit well with a foreign blockbuster that does big box-office in the states and spawns a serious cult following (case in point ""Le Femme Nikita""). All in all, ""Dawn of the Dead"" is like a trip to ""McDonalds"". You know what your going to get even before the first reel of the film reflects off the screen. Fast food film at it's finest.",1080086400,,2633,4.698481561822126

First a movie about some guy being tortured to death onscreen for two hours makes over two million at the box office in three weeks, and now Hollywood is producing quality films about...zombies?  I mean, having Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" turn out as good as it did was enough of a freak accident, but the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" is like some kind of divine gift.  I feel like God is saying, ""Thanks for sitting through that pretentious crap called ""The Passion of the Christ"" two weeks ago.  I can't refund your money, but maybe this will make up for it.""  And if God ain't saying it, then some executive at Universal is.
This is a remake of George A. Romero's vomit-inducing classic, so of course you've seen this story before.  A band of people (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Jake Weber ), make their way to the local mall, trapping themselves inside against countless numbers of the living dead.  Not much in the way of story, but I think screenwriter James Gunn was wary of this.  Instead of paying much attention to plot or the zombies (there's not even an explanation of why the dead are walking the earth), Gunn's script focuses mainly on the survivors and their dealing with the dire situation.  Polley's nurse grieves over the loss of her husband while Weber as the salesman is able to keep his head during the carnage.  By keeping these characters fresh and interesting, instead of just throwing them in the film to be zombie fodder, Gunn has given the audience reason to invest their time in these people.  I remember pleading for the lives of several characters.  Only one of those characters made it to the end (I think.  Stay through the credits and you'll see what I mean).

The film never feels like a bland character study though.  There's plenty of zombie killing action, with the number of gun battles outnumbering the scares.  Music video director Zack Snyder knows how to handle explosions, pulling the camera back wide every time something blows up to give the destruction a much bigger feel.  Those with insatiable cinema bloodlust will find that this film's gore level outdoes ""Resident Evil"" and ""House of the Dead"" combined.  Heads explode, intestines are torn out, throats are eaten.  There's a great scene with a chainsaw that fondly reminded me of ""Evil Dead"".  And what is a zombie movie without chainsaws?  The filmmakers even throw in a few horror movie cliches for good measure.
The make-up effects are top-notch but not gratuitous.  There are a few zombies with hamburger faces, but many of them just have feral, yellow eyes and grey skin, like the ones in ""28 Days Later"".  The zombies also run really fast like in ""28"", instead of limping after their victims.  This is the one, tiny problem I had with the film.  Werewolves and vampires are fast.  They're always chasing down their prey before ripping them apart.  One of the scary and unique things about the old school zombies is that they used to be slow and dumb, yet they would always find a way catch the living.  You could never be too cocky around them because they would end up cornering you or ambushing you from behind a closed door.  And they always outnumbered you.  This remake gets the last part right (the escape from the mall is nightmarish), but by presenting this version of the undead to be so much more livelier takes away some of the suspense.
Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the best monster movie gore-fest that's come out for a long time.  If he can work this kind of magic here, I can't help but wonder what he could do with ""Day of the Dead"".  Here's hoping we'll see someday.

2066721,1,B00027SIUK,"Being a huge fan of the original, thus keeping my expectations low of the remake, I did manage to go into the theater with an open mind.  The first ten minutes of the film had me on the edge of my seat, and succeeded in raising my expectations.  Sadly, the film went down hill from there.
This film is yet another example of Hollywood's shabby treatment of what could be a fascinating subject matter for depth of horror.  Forget realistic, mature character/plot development, there was none.  I have no doubt this film will do well with the under-25 crowd.  To be fair, the movie had some decent scenes in the beginning of the film, along with the birth scene (though they could have done so much more with it).  As for the director, his shortcuts were shameful...here are a few, along with other comments.
- no elaboration on ""News Update"" during shower scene (or anywhere else in the movie)
- the main character driving and hitting a tree outside a mall ten minutes into the movie was too convenient and plot limiting
- few effects --special or otherwise.
- the title theme was incongruent and annoying
- the end theme --some obnoxious head-banging crap-- was even worse, and was the final nail in the coffin.  Talk about leaving a movie and hating it.
The last half hour of the movie had more action scenes, but they were of the stop-action, strobe effect type, which only resulted in confusion, and ultimately worse, the inability to see scenes/characters/zombies clearly...talk about a shortcut and insult!
In summary:  the script, the characters, the plot, the mood, the music, the directing, the effects...they were all sadly lacking.  Congrats Hollywood, on producing yet another shallow movie and propagating the masses...seems to be the norm these days.",1080086400,12,1762,4.846666666666667

2066723,4,B00027SIUK,"There have been a decent number of zombie movies in the recent past, but -
Night of the Living Dead (1995) - like the Psycho remake
28 Days Later - Smart and creepy, but gets confusing and lacks much action for a story about people in an entire world of monsters (there are almost none encountered for stretches, where thousands should be nearby)
Resident Evil - Considering the fact that the games were inspired by George A Romero's trilogy, and that the long epic in the game series was altered to make the movie, it was disappointing
House of the Dead - Whatever
Outside of possibly 28 Days Later, this is easily the best of those movies just mentioned, and while Resident Evil contained high production values as well, this movie had much more character, much more intensity (not quite as scary), and doesn't just have like 3 or 4 scenes with zombies in them.
The action is handled not only more flashy like a modern movie, as well as faster to speed the action up - but is most importantly on a massive scale, which adds a much greater sense of reality to if such an event were to take place.  Also, while I'm not one for brutal violence in movies, humans fighting unnatural not-quite humans with extream violence adds a feeling of...sincerity to the movie.  If something comes at you to eat you, you can't just push it away, or ignore them and hope they'll go away.  The original was brutal for its time, although it's rather tame for today.  This was much more like an actual open war, with the phrase ""War is Hell"" taking a very serious meaning, as well as a sort of literal one.
True, however, for a movie that strives to make as much realistic sense out of the fictional setting and circumstances, there are a few parts that shouldn't have happened, simply because I don't know if they really would happen.  Examples include some humans, only hours or days after the outbreak occurs, that treat other humans as either enemies, or hostages, and more than once, there's someone who hears a zombie behind a door, and they open it anyway.  And it never occurs to anyone that maybe just leaving the zombies trapped outside could eventually starve them out (like in 28 Days Later).  Wasn't the whole point of the mall in the first Dawn of the Dead: ""if you've found a safe haven, why would you want or need to escape?""  The characters this time around didn't quite figure that part out.
The ending, like the original was abrupt, and somewhat disappointing.  While I was disappointed with the ending of the first movie, I finally figured out what makes these endings disappointing.  The 2004 earned a good ending, as with its own merits, it was a good movie; the 1978 ending was mostly upsetting because I realized that this movie, which had grown on me since I started watching, was over.  I was fine with this movie ending after only 100 minutes; I was fine with what I was given (outside of the first 30 minutes, with random killings, explosions, and a slow pace with a few bits that don't quite add up).
Overall, on its own two feet, the 2004 ""equivalent"" of Dawn of the Dead stands reasonably well.  Just don't go see it without first knowing the legacy of the original, and don't expect another miracle of a horror like the ""Dawn"" before.",1080000000,24,3247,4.541095890410959
2066724,4,B00027SIUK,"Dawn of the Dead, a remake of the George A. Romero classic is simply plain fun.  Sure it differs from the remake, but still
is able to be entertaining, I think it was probably a remake which was just as good as the original unlike the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake which came out in October of 2003.  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was fine, and featured a few good spooks but Dawn of the Dead is a great deal gorier and a lot more fun.
  Sarah Polley stars as Ana, who soon encounters the zombies, when her husband is bitten by one and attacks her.  The beginning is pretty scary and intense.  Soon she encounters a few more survivors and they hide for cover in a shopping mall.
Other survivors include Ving Rhames, Mekhi Pfeifer and Jake Weber.  Dawn of the Dead is a fine, well-acted, nicely written if pointless remake.  The pace of the movie is great, it doesn't feel too long or too short, it's a 98 minute feature by the way.  Director Zach Snyder makes his debut with ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and it looks like we'll see other good films from him

The movie shook all of us to the core.  To this day scenes from the movie resonate in my mind.
  Which brings us to the remake.  On it's own this is a perfectly acceptable horror movie.  It has a stylish look, great acting and although predictable a script that delivers everything that it should.  What it doesn't have is that gnawing sense of alienation, isolation, anxiety and desperation that Romero created in the original.  Also to get an R rating- I imagine the idea was to indicate the gore without really showing it.  Most of the blood seemed a blur.

2066727,2,B00027SIUK,"I love a good remake-film, sometimes more than the original. John Carpenter's *The Thing*, for example, both improves upon and pays homage to Howard Hawk's classic horror/sci-fi film. Bad remakes, then, inspire opposite feelings.
But what if a remake not a remake? Take Zack Snyder's *Dawn of the Dead*, which I caught at my local cinema six hours ago. Snyder's first film is gory fun, so long as people understand it is a horror potpourri and not a remake of any kind.
26 Years Earlier
Horror-innovator George A. Romero wrote and directed *Dawn of the Dead*: a direct sequel to his 1968 hit *Night of the Living Dead*. In *Night*, a space probe returns from Venus with a mysterious radiation that animates all dead people. It also grants the dead a poisonous bite which kills people within three days. Risen dead are slow, mindless... and relentless, always hungering for human flesh. Only destroying their brains will stop them. *Night* concludes with America physically in control, but morally and intellectually degraded.
*Dawn* dawns ten years later, when human rivalry and incompetence has allowed the living dead to reach critical numbers. Many Americans refuse to destroy the corpses of their loved ones, forcing authorities to invade barricaded neighborhoods packed with zombies. Meanwhile the pleas of scientists to resort to extreme measures are ignored. While vigilantes and soldiers roam the countryside, four people desert to a mall where they build a capitalist Garden of Eden. Eventually they are forced out by more meddling people and zombies. This sets the stage for a 1986 film, when the dead have conquered the earth.
Along the way, Romero fills his film with social commentary. *Dawn* damns consumerism, while challenging both racism and sexism through its strong black and female characters. It portrays an apocalypse allowed because people could not be rational and cooperative.
Ye who think such commentary obtrusive fear not. Thanks to effects master Tom Savini, Romero's *Dawn of the Dead* offers NC-17 level violence for those inclined. Those who like interpersonal drama will be pleased by the character sketches. Romero also offers plenty of juvenile mischief and humor.
False Dawn
Snyder filmed and cut a different story. So different that the title ""Dawn of the Dead"" does not apply. *Night of the Living Dead* never happened. Snyder's *Dawn* begins with the world in order (aside from ominous news broadcasts). Five minutes into the film, zombies just show up and start snacking on people. Bites zombify people by some kind of infection. These zombies screech at their prey as they scuttle and leap like the reapers in *Blade II*. Somehow, they conquer the country in a day. A squad of people takes cover in a mall, and then decides to make a break to a deserted island. Snyder's film, unsurprisingly, is much shorter than Romero's.
And less believable. I failed to see how Snyder's zombies could be so widespread so quickly when they can only reproduce through a blood-borne infection. Snyder skips over this with a disposable comment. Likewise, I failed to see how the police and the military could not slow or stop the threat. For all their speed, Snyder's zombies can be stopped by body shots. Furthermore, Snyder's humans more or less unite against the zombie front. Yet one character simply mentions that a nearby Army base was inexplicably overrun. What part of ""attack helicopters"" do these people not understand?
Snyder's film has no intellectual aspirations of any kind. Nor does ascribe much depth to its ensemble cast. It settles with a commercial ""R"" rating. And it follows the style of contemporary cinema
House of an Alien Blair Exorcist Dead on Elm Street
Taking cues from *1000 Corpses* and MTV, the filmmakers depend heavily on quick cuts and grainy video. Snyder also prefers jiggling close ups for his action scenes. Most of America's conquest is related during the opening credit sequence by a montage of stock news footage mixed with flashes of scary faces. The blood-styled credit sequences reminded me of *Freddy vs Jason*. In another *1000 Corpses* nod, Snyder lays an often whimsical soundtrack.
Many sequences are set up, consciously or unconsciously, like those from other horror films. Look for scene and cinematography nods to *Alien*, *The Exorcist*, *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*, and especially *28 Days Later* and *The Blair Witch Project*.
*Dawn of the Dead* references include a few paraphrases of lines from Romero's film. One of the original cast members makes a cameo. Tom Savini pops up as a hardened Sheriff paraphrasing lines from *NotLD*.
Overall, these sequences were too much crammed into too little running time. Action scenes ended too quickly and lack the satisfaction of Romero's drawn-out tension and desperate sequences.
Blood Where Blood is Due
Snyder is not Romero. He aims for scary zombie faces leaping out of shadows and loud noises. The opening sequence where a husband is attacked, zombified, and then attacks his wife impressed me with the horror of having somebody you love suddenly turn on you. Snyder also manages some decent gore scenes involving shotguns, broken sticks, and chainsaws. Snyder seeds his film with horror references to spot as in an Easter-egg hunt, and frequent gasoline explosions for Michael Bay and John Woo fans.
The lead actors are at least superficially appealing; Ving Rhames offers another solid performance as a hard-boiled man, and Sarah Polley's facial features are exploited to the fullest by the cinematographer. I also liked Jake Weber's unfazed rationality.
Dead End
I didn't ultimately like Zack Snyder's *Dawn of Dead*, however. It is not a remake, and so it should not pass as one. If anything, Director Snyder has Americanized Danny Boyle's *28 Days Later* (2002), stirred in a heap o' horror movie references and style, then tacked on ""Dawn of the Dead"" for its title. A gory, nihilistic romp from first frame to last, Snyder's *Dawn* resurrects the spirit of *House of a 1000 Corpses* and *The Blair Witch Project* more than Romero's classic.",1080000000,8,6071,5.1086519114688125
2066738,4,B00027SIUK,"All us ""movie people"" LOVE to get all nutty about ""remakes"". They're cheap, they're lazy, they're little pieces of self-promotion coasting by on a wave of nostalgia-fueled brand-name recognition.

Michael Bay is producing a remake of Tobe Hooper's immortal Texas Chainsaw Massacre? Blasphemy! How DARE he! And what's this? Universal Pictures is mounting a big-budget adaptation of what's arguably the Gone with the Wind of horror films: George Romero's Dawn of the Dead? It's gotta SUCK!
Right?
Perhaps it's just easier to accept the simple fact that remakes are just like any other 'genre' you might enjoy: some of the movies are going to suck, some will be brilliant, and most will fall somewhere in between. I mean, the works of William Shakespeare have seen thousands of ""remakes"" over the centuries, and we call that High Art. So surely the modern classics of Horror can stand a little modernizations...imitation being oh so flattering, and all that dumb stuff.
As someone who considers both The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Dawn of the Dead brilliant art and not just great horror films, it's safe to assume that I was skeptical (yet optimistic) as this new wave of remakes began to slide down the pike. Marcus Nispel's Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake managed to be a pretty dog-gone entertaining joltfest in its own right, while never once ""disgracing"" its source material, as all the gorehound hand-wringers were sure it would.
Nispel's movie gave me high hopes that a newer and sleeker Dawn of the Dead could prove worthwhile after all. And wouldn't you know it? These new kids are now 2 for 2.
It's when remakes rely too heavily upon the originals that we get uninspired crap like The Haunting or pointless copycatting like Psycho. But David Cronenberg set the standard way back in 1986 when he remade The Fly. Using the campy old classic as a mere jumping-off point, Cronenberg forged some brilliant new ground, resulting in a movie that paid due homage to its ""father"" while standing quite capably on its own two feet.
So the formula seems to be this: take a great old horror movie that you love, snatch the proper moments that the fans will want to see, and then go out and make your OWN movie. And that's just what director Zack Snyder did. The result is a fantastic modern horror flick that clearly holds a lot of respect for Romero's original, but is itself a new beast entirely.
We all know the story by now: End of the world, the streets are packed with cannibalistic zombie corpses, a few lucky survivors end up hiding out inside of a suburban shopping mall. But while Romero's film was half horror and half social commentary, Snyder's version is a horror/action mindless joy.
Whereas the earlier legions of undead were content to shuffle around waiting for some unlucky human to stumble into their paths, the 2004 models are quick and speedy and more than a little persistent. Consequently, some of the movie's best sequences feel more inspired by Aliens than by a traditional zombie flick. But that's certainly not a bad thing.
Here's the meat: Dawn of the Dead is a harsh, brutal and devilishly nasty little horror movie. It sets a dark effective tone of the end of time, which serves to make the gory attacks even more horrific. The flick moves at a lightning pace, the screenplay is tight, and Snyder's directorial style is a little impressive. The whole thing's capped off with a clever ending; how 'happy' the ending is depends on how far you make it into the end credits.
Sure, it's fair to say that Romero's Dawn will never be surpassed, and that's probably true. But that doesn't mean we can't enjoy a spiffy new souped-up version.
The bottom line seems to be that remakes, just like any other movies, deserve to be SEEN before they're dismissed as pointless. Would you rather have a quality remake or something that's 'original' but crappy? There are dozens of zombie movies out there that AREN'T remakes, and this one's easily more entertaining than just about all of 'em.",1080000000,,4001,4.806966618287373

Zack Snyder, for a new and upcoming director did an outstanding job directing this remake and the cast was exceptional in their performances as well. They deserve a lot more than some of these reviews care to give them.
I watched the original Director's Cut DOTD before this remake and while that movie was a decent horror movie for its time, this remake literally wipes the floor off the original in my opinion. The zombies are faster and scarier, the movie is much more fast paced than the original, the characters are much more realistic, the effects are amazing, and while the movie borrows a lot of ideas from the original, it keeps things fresh and different enough so as to avoid being too predictable.
Also, unlike most horror movies that for some reason seem to be plagued with amateur actors and unrealistic performnaces, this movie really stands out among the rest. The shotgun-weilding ...cop (Ving Rhames), the street smart tough guy (Mekhi Pfifer) with his pregnant girlfriend, the smart and capable female lead (Sarah Polley) the quick-thinking and resourceful electronic salesman (Jack Weber), the badguy-turned-good no-nonsense security guard (Michael Kelley), the sharp-shooting sniper/gun shop owner (dunno his name), etc are all great in their individual roles. None of them take away from the feel of the movie (anyone remember the nagging blonde woman from Night of the Living Dead? Ugh)..
For some reason the action in this movie reminded me a lot of sequences from James Cameron's Aliens. They were frantic, fast paced and always focused on the action at hand. Many instances in this movie will make you cringe. Unlike the original's slow-moving zombies, these zombies run, jump and move in packs! And not all the action in the film takes place in the mall. In fact the remake's ending is completely different from the original ending. And once again, IMO, a lot better. DONT LEAVE THE THEATER WHEN THE ENDING CREDITS ROLL! THERE'S MORE!
Enough banter, if you're a fan of zombie movies in general, just stop reading and go watch this movie NOW!

If you want something mindless, this new version of DOD is just what the doctor ordered.  Disappointingly, nothing much has changed sine the 1979 version.  A group of survivors flee to a mall run by the mall security force.  After a few run-ins with the outdoor zombie population, and an infiltration, they leave in modified mall vans, complete with gun and chainsaw ports.
In one particularly memorable scene, a mall security guard tosses a propane tank into a crowd of zombies and shoots it.  The resulting explosion resembles a small atomic bomb, mowing down the zombies like wheat.  Hilarious!
Eventually, the survivors make it to a marina and take off in a boat.  The movie appears to end there, but if you watch through the credits you will see the survivors make it to an island.  It kind of looks like they die there, but I suppose that depends on the success of this film and any potential sequel profit.
When watching DOD 04, its best not to ask any questions:  Why did the zombies come about?  How can they tell the living from the dead?  Why are the zombies able to run like in 28 DAYS?

If ""Resident Evil"" wasn't a credited remake of ""Day Of The Dead"" then certainly this shouldn't be one of ""Dawn"".

I was one of the most skeptical of the idea of a ""Dawn"" remake scripted by ""Scooby Doo"" movie screenwriter James Gunn but the movie actually provides quite a bit of bang for your buck. The zombies in Snyder's ""Dawn"" are less the slow-moving creatures from the Romero world and more like the fast-paced infected terrors in Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"". While some Romero traditionalists might view this as ""cinematic blasphamy"", it does make the walking dead a far greater threat and adds a far greater deal of tension to the film.
Like the original, the new ""Dawn"" involves a group of people trying to survive a zombie plague who take refuge in a shopping center. Instead of only four characters, there are more than a dozen or so, the central being Sarah Polley's good-natured nurse and Ving Rhames' survivalist cop. Also thrown in the mix are a rag-tag trio of mall security guards, a drug dealer and his pregnant girlfriend, and a handful of other survivors. Snyder and Gunn never really explore the type of social commentary that many often associated with Romero's ""Dead"" films. The characters do argue and have their differences but it only becomes a problem in small portions. Where Romero showed society being ripped apart by its own inability to function in a crisis, Snyder chooses to go more for the ""Assault On Precinct 13"" approach. Mankind is being wiped out by the strength of its opposition, not by its lack of unity.
Zack Snyder's direction of ""Dawn"" is both hit and miss. The opening five minutes or so are a real poor start but the moment that Sarah Polley's Anna is thrown into the chaotic Wisconsin streets, we are bombared with amazing images of widespread terror. Similiar images involving amusing sight gags and fast-paced imagery prove rewarding but Snyder seems to also suffer from the ""Michael Bay"" snydrome of throwing in flashy shots for the sake of being flashy. One such case involves one of the film's only major human conflicts in which two characters are pitted against one another in a sort of stand-off. We're treated with all sorts of violent eye candy as blood spills, brain fragments erupt, and we're treated to close-up after close-up of empty shells hitting the floor. What should have been a powerful character moment is reduced to a loud gun battle with about as much emotion as a Super Bowl car ad. A concluding ode to the ""Blair Witch Project"" also smacks of a director more intruiged by cheap visual flare than good story-telling. Snyder is more or less the Michael Bay to Romero's John Woo.
James Gunn's script, while devoid of any of the real character interaction and social commentary that made Romero's ""Dawn"" such a powerful film, does have a good deal of fun with its content. Having the characters bounce golf-balls off their zombie counter-parts' heads and play a ""shooting game"" that involves celebrity look-a-likes adds a lot of humor to the film without down playing its intesity. If there is one thing that I can definetly say is done right with this new ""Dawn"", it's providing tense moments. As mentioned before, the zombies are not slow-moving so escaping from them is far more difficult. The humans aren't given the ability to play around with them like they were in other films. Aside from the quicker zombies, Gunn does his best to stay loyal to the Romero mytholigy though there are some instances where his attempts to create new shocks out of an old premise result in some awful ideas such as a predictable and thorougly cheesy ""zombie baby"" sequence.
""Dawn Of The Dead"" is probably one of the better remakes to come out in awhile. While it isn't on the same level as say, John Carpenter's ""The Thing"", it does do an honorable job of making zombie movies both scary and fun again. It is far more of a stand-alone film than Savini's remake of Romero's ""Night"", which more or less played the same exact story with a different cast. It also outshines the handful of zombie films, such as Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil"", which borrowed so heavily from Romero's ""Dead"" films. Only ""28 Days Later"" can really boast doing the job better. I think it would have worked fine on its own merits without using ""Dawn"" as its title but I'm sure that Richard Rubenstein is happy to get the check in the mail.",1079913600,,4892,4.709451575262544

2066754,4,B00027SIUK,"When a friend first e-mailed me the link to the new Dawn of the Dead movie, I was highly sceptical. Being an avid movie buff, and a horror-film enthusiast, I didn't think the ""re-imagining"" could do justice to the original. While I approached it's release date with a combined feeling of anticipation and dread, I took a deep breath, bought a ticket, and sat down. I was pretty pleased. I really enjoyed the first third or so, showing the city going to hell, where the original started after the you-know-what really hit the fan. I thought the film was cast reasonably well, especially Rhames. There were, however, a few things that bothered me about the story. In the original, there was no real explanation as to why the dead were coming back to life, and that's one of the reasons I love that concept; if you find out that the reason for the walking dead is voodoo, or a virus, it takes away some of the mystery for me, some of the horror.  But it seemed that in the new version, a person could only come back if they'd been ""infected"", lending to the theory of a virus/disease. I also thought that the survivors in the new film got into the mall a little too easily, considering that all the doors they found were locked, and only a few zombies were inside. It seemed that the only way the zombies got inside is when someone shut a door too slowly. I also thought that their decision to leave the mall was a little too hasty; in the original, the survivors found a safe haven and utopian existence in the mall, and the mall in the new version seemed even more secure in some respect, raising the question, why would they want to leave? There weren't any bandits or raiders hinted at in the new version... I also felt that if it were easy enough to drive a truck across a parking lot to where the gunstore owner was trapped, why not just have him jump on top and drive back? Ah, well. All in all, I thought it was a satisfying horror film, even worthy of it's borrowed title. It scared the hell out of my girlfriend, and even made me jump a few times. And I also find it sad and frustrating that many film legacies can't be carried on due to budget constraints or not enough prospective payoff, most prevalent being Romero's Dead Reckoning. But I propose this: I'd love Romero's new movie be made, so why not start a collection? Any fan who wants to donate $500 or more could be cast as a zombie extra in Romero's new film. It's perfect! What die-hard fan wouldn't pay to both see a new Romero zombie flick, but also be immortalized in the process?! And maybe even top donator's could wind up lead zombies and eating human entrails or getting their brains blown out! Several thousand fans could get Romero a budget of a few million, and he's made better with less! All I know is that I'd donate at least a few thousand, and I don't even want a cut at the end. I LOVE the films that much. I'd also pay to see a new installment in the Evil Dead series, and I think I'd make a kick-a$$ deadite. Well, I'll keep dreaming, until my undead head is hollowed out by a high-caliber weapon, or I'm bodily dismembered by a chainsaw. And also, for those that think that Romero's getting completely gypped on this one? The Divimax version of the original Dawn of the Dead was released in timing with the release of the new film, and who knows? Maybe a cut on that and a cut on the new film will bring enough start-up funds for Dead Reckoning. And for those who want to accuse the new Dawn of the Dead of being a remake: focus your boycott on people who REALLLLY shouldn't be remaking films, like Mark Wahlburg; I only have two words to sum up the ""updated"" versions of Planet of the Apes, the Truth About Charlie, and the Italian Job: Jesus Wept.",1079827200,6,3736,4.3447782546494995

I never saw the orignal, but was looking foward to the remake. I enjoyed ""Dawn of the Dead"" but there was something missing. It wasn't like ""28 Days Later..."" That was about a virus that was spreading around the UK like wildfire. This is about dead people coming to Earth after hell runs out of room. They are similiar in the way that the dead people act. The zombies in ""28 Days Later..."" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" both had super running speed, wanting to feed on flesh, etc. I don't see how people believe that ""Dawn of the Dead"" is just a ripoff of ""28 Days Later..."" It is actually close to the other way around. I liked ""Dawn of the Dead"" to the extent that it was entertaining. The acting wasn't that bad, but I didn't get scared at all. It was eerie, but I was never deeply scared. It had to much comic relief that killed the mood of a horror film. This is something that I should have rented on DVD.
The plot is the same as the orignal. Anna is a nurse who is happily married with a young daughter. One mourning, she wakes up to find her daughter at the door. The daughter has blood on her face, and bites her husband. Her husband dies, comes back to life, and tries to kill Anna. (...)
""Dawn of the Dead"" had a couple of eerie images-including the dead people, them running, the bloody daughter, and a scene with Andre and Linda-but none of these scenes scared me. I was scared with ""The Ring,"" and ""One Hour Photo"" but this film was more entertaining then scary. I did like it, but it was missing fear, which is probally why the 197something orignal was so great. I also felt that the movie ended to quickly. It ended, but I felt that there should have been something more.
I don't understand violence in films. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was a very violent film. I thought that it was more violent then ""The Passion of The Christ"" but they don't mention this one. (...) ENJOY!

2066760,5,B00027SIUK,"""Dawn Of The Dead"" is brilliantly creepy! This movie is a little bit better than ""28 Days Later"" because it doesn't seem to stop in the middle of the story. The story is about a nurse named Ana, played by Sarah Polley, whose world is turned around one morning she wakes up and finds zombies everywhere. She finds a group of survivors, headed by, Kenneth, played by Ving Rhames. They go to a deserted shopping mall for shelter. Part of the group of the survivors are Michael, played by Jake Weber, Andre, played by Mekhi Phifer, and Andre's wife, Luda, played by, Inna Korobkina. When they get there, they don't receive a warm welcome by the security guards, CJ, played by, Michael Kelly, Terry, played by, Kevin Zegers, and Bart, played by, Michael Barry. More survivors start to show up. Norma, played by, Jayne Eastwood, Tucker, played by, Boyd Banks, Monica, played by, Kim Poirier, Nicole, played by, Lindy Booth, Glen, played by, R.D. Reid, Frank, played by, Matt Frewer, and Steve, played by, Ty Burrell. There is also another survivor, a gun shop owner on the roof of his gun shop store, Andy, played by, Bruce Bohne. The events that occur are very frightening, indeed. This movie is creepily interesting and powerful moving, at times. This movie is well executed, thanks, in part to its director, a first-time filmmaker, Zack Snyder, whose direction of the movie was brilliant and powerful, without compromise and this is one of the best remakes that I have ever seen, better than ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (2003). The performances by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mekhi Phifer, are excellent. The rest of the cast are great. The screenplay by James Gunn, who wrote the screenplays to ""Scooby-Doo"" (2002) & ""Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed"" (2004), did a excellent job on the screenplay, which is, a great companion to Romero's original screenplay. The music by Tyler Bates is excellent. The cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti is excellent. The make-up on the zombies by David LeRoy Anderson is brilliant and they look really convincing. The film editing by Niven Howie is great. The casting by Robin D. Cook & Joseph Middleton is great. The production design by Andrew Neskoromny and costume design by Denise Cronenberg is excellent.

It pretty much gets straight to the point, as a group of people run straight to the mall and lock themselves in. Before the televisions go off the air, there is a chilling moment. A preacher looks directly in the camera and says ""When there is no more room in hell, the dead shall walk the earth."" Then the characters realize just like the book of Revelations, that it is Armeggedon, the end of the world.

At 6:37 one morning, the couple is awakened when a neighbor girl enters their home, standing in shadowed darkness in their bedroom doorway -- part of her face, around the mouth, peeled away.  The husband freaks, goes to her to examine her wounds -- and is promptly relieved of a huge chunk in his neck when the little girl takes a bite out of him.  Seconds later he too is a flesh-eating zombie, and Sarah Polley manages to get out of the house and to her car, where she learns her whole neighborhood ... and eventually, the world ... is plagued with zombies that bite/eat the living, only to turn them into zombies, as well.  Finally coming across other living humans, the small group of local survivors hole up in the Crossroads Mall while they try to figure out a plan ...
While it doesn't have the most uplifting ending, the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is laced with enough gore, humor, and scares to keep you well entertained.  You will both cower and jump in your seat, there are plenty of those kinds of moments, and the performances (especially by Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, and Jake Weber -- Sarah Polley is okay, but she sort of got on my nerves) are better than you'd expect in a zombie movie, with an excellent cast overall.
The film is shot in the herky-jerky style of ""28 Days Later"" (but is a much better film -- actually SCARY, which ""28"" was not), and the zombies move fast enough to chase speeding cars, which makes for some good visuals.

Because of this, I was not so keen on seeing a ham-handed remake of what I considered to be a great film.  I went into the remake of Dawn of the Dead with my fangs bared.
This movie is fantastic.  It is a more than acceptable re-make of the original Dawn of the Dead.  It pays tribute to the original cast (both Roger and Peter have cameos) and it is shot with a flare that will remind you of Romero's hay-days.  And, it's scary.  Did I mention that?  This film is legitimately frightening.  Walk in with your imagination switched on, and you won't be disappointed.
You won't find the one-trick jump-scares and shameless Pepsi plugs that litter a film like 28 Days Later.  (And I'm not even going to go into how many levels of stupidity and motion-picture ignorance are involved with even comparing the two, much less asserting that 28 Days Later is better.)

Bland directing, generally; some interesting, rather artsy cinematography; nice special effects; and variable, but generally acceptable acting.  One might be inclined to say that this is high praise for a ""zombie"" movie, but, having seen 28 Days Later, the bar has been set far higher.  While 28 Days Later, itself, didn't realize all of the potential of the genre, it showed how inspired storytelling, and directing, could resurrect (gotcha) a tired idea.  This remake also suffers from a generally amateurish screenplay.  There are moments of humor, and some flashes of intelligence, but, overall, the dialogue is unremarkable, and the cliches abound.  There's even a very silly scene with a zombie baby.  I had to laugh out loud.

The main characters were written and performed with such maturity that I can say with sincerity that I did care about them, where as with the minor characters I found that I was asking myself 'So at what point are they going to become zombie chow?' (Interestingly, one of them has a close encounter not with a zombie but with a chainsaw :P .) This lack of adding depth to the minor characters was one of the few weak points in an otherwise effective script (maybe it was because they would eventually become casualties that they weren't fleshed out more.) The only exception regarding the minor characters was the gunshop owner, Andy, whose trapped inside his store and communicates with the mall survivors via dry-erase board. He had no spoken lines (if you don't count the written messages) except in one scene roughly three-quarters of the way through the film, and yet I found that I cared for this character when his situation started to become dire.
  As with the original film, this one had a strong end-of-the-world vibe going for it that should appeal to fans of the original. You just know that after the first twenty minutes of the movie that there's no going back to a normal world (the first ten minutes is when it all hits the fan.) This is the driving force that motivates the characters into learning to cope with this new environment as well as each other. And whenever it seems that a problem has been overcome, a new one arises. It's almost a bit like 'Aliens' in this regard. This is what keeps 'Dawn' exciting. The expectation of 'Something-Bad' is going to happen keeps you on your toes.
  For the gore fans out there, I don't believe you would be disappointed as long as you keep in mind that this movie has an 'R' rating. It's definitely one of the bloodiest new films I've seen in a while although it's not on the scale of, let's say, the scene in 'Day of the Dead' when Rhodes is torn in half. Better yet, it's not gore for gore sake. Now, some would argue that the birthing scene was uncalled for, but it was effective in evoking sympathy for the characters involved. It makes me wonder if when this film is released on DVD, would it have the option to view an unrated version?
  I do have one other grievance other than the way the minor characters were written. I must warn you that this paragraph will contain spoilers, so if you don't want to have the film ruined for you, skip to the next paragraph. My grievance has to do with the reasoning behind the mall survivors leaving the safety of the mall. They had a good thing going for them, but after one big moral setback (the birthing scene), they agree to leave. Why? I didn't feel that their situation was becoming that desparate. As a matter of fact, all they had to do to survive the zombie plague, assuming that they didn't run out of supplies such as food and water, was to wait till the zombies rot to a point that they would no longer pose a threat. As the movie progresses, you actually see this decaying prossess occuring in the zombie makeup. A similar idea can be seen in the movie '28 Days Later'. All that the survivors had to do was wait for the infected to die of hunger (assuming they could survive each other.) I agree that they needed to do something to save Andy, but if they managed to pull of rescuing him instead of having food delivered by the dog, 'Chips', they could just settle back in the mall and wait the plague out. Granted, it would be inevitable that they would have to come out of the mall in order to keep the story going, but I don't feel the reasoning for it was effective enough, whereas in the original 'Dawn', the survivors were forced out by the bikers and zombies. James Gunn could have been a bit more effective in this part of the story, which was my deciding factor on giving this film 4 stars instead of 5.
  Overall, 'Dawn of the Dead' 2004 does not do a disservice to the orignal. Not bad for the guy who penned the 'Scooby Doo' script and a director who did commercials before taking the helm of this film. I had fun with this movie and maybe you will to.",1079740800,2,4649,4.40162980209546
2066782,5,B00027SIUK,"Throughout the 90s I had been fed up with our mall obsessed culture and I had a yearning to see 1978 ""The Dawn of the Dead"". I remembered seeing most of it in the early 80s as a child. I couldn't remember most things about it. Just images: A large black man with a shotgun, zombies ambling through the mall, zombies surrounding a truck, a gun shoved in an infected persons mouth and brains on the wall; a sense of darkness. It left a strong impression.
I bought the VHS in the late 90s as an adult and watched it. The movie was very different than I remembered. You know how you see something as a kid, are impressed by it, and you go back and see it as an adult and are not impressed at all? The movie was slow moving and kinda boring, and the blood looked like house paint. The acting and characters weren't compelling.
I was especially dissapointed with work of the black actor who played one of the SWAT guys, since his image and character was the one that left a strong impression on me the first time I saw 'Dawn'.  (he had a cameo in the new movie too, as a televangelist, and sucked there as well)
So I go and see the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" and was very impressed. It was fast moving, getting right to it. It was like the original ""Night of the Living Dead""; a crisis happens and people are thrown together. No backstories, no explanations of their prior lives. In a movie like this the audience doesn't wanna hear somebody sit down and talk about their relationship with their momma. The only thing that matters now is characters sticking together and surviving. As for character building, that was covered during the action. We know who all the characters are by their actions and things they say allude to what kid of person they are.
As for losing the originals Dawn's 'message' about consumerism, I must ask, what did the original 'Dawn' say about consumerism besides having zombies congregate at the mall and shuffle through the aisles (like mall goers today)? Romero wasn't deep, he just came up with a good gimmick. The new 'Dawn' used the same mall setting but was a much better movie and the actors/main characters were more likeable than the people in the 1978 'Dawn'. As for the additional number of survivors, well that's probably more realisistic. All I have to say is pick your favorites, sit back and watch the show. It's a movie, dude.
Oh yeah, and the jokes were better too. 'Celebrity Hunt' and 'He's a twitcher'
I also wanna say that I am glad there was only one real product placement in the movie (Aquafina and I think Sobe, but you couldn't see the labels on those bottles) and that this fact alone tells you where the filmmakers' heart was at considering they had plenty of chances and excuses for endorsements with this movie being set in a mall and all. Check out the coffee shop! No frickin' Starbucks, but 'Hallowed Grounds' which was clever and took on more meaning than one, since it main meeting place away from the action for the characters in the film.

The filmmakers here had more integrity where product placement was concerned, unlike Spielberg in the upcoming 'Terminal' set in an airport/mall, which uses real stores and products all over the place(including the dreaded 'Starbucks'..",1079740800,5,3231,4.549828178694158

The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" does not have the satire of that the original possessed, but it does contain the same warped and twisted sense of humor.

And the action is defiantly some of the best in any horror movie in a while because the last twenty minutes play out like a roller coaster ride of edge of your seat fun! the characters while not as developed as the originals are rounded out enough to the point where you want to see them make it to safety. And some credit must be given to the fact that this movie has a lot more survivors to deal with than the originals four. Ving Rhames i think was the real stand out. The man just knows how to play a bad a** and it shows in almost every scene he's in. Sarah Polley also gave a standout performance as Ana which is good because she's pretty much the protagonist of the story from the beginning to the end. Ill add also for about the first time ever i actually thought the zombies were a real threat and even kind of scary. while i wasn't scared i was however thrilled by the action scenes with there amazing amount of tension, and there was quite a few jumps and screams from the packed theatre i was in.
 on a side note Ill admit the plot does seem a little similar to 28 days later, but aside from the zombies moving really fast at there victims there really isn't any comparison worth mentioning. Besides the people in 28 days later weren't zombies anyway they were people infected with a virus. In this movie you die before you become infected.
 Also on a very important note, either leave the theatre when the screen fades to black at the end or watch the credits all the way till the final frame. Just trust me on this one the people who leave and the ones that stay are going to get something completely different out of this film.",1079740800,,1886,4.280112044817927
2066796,5,B00027SIUK,"In 1979 one of the greatest zombie movies ever was made, 25 years later it's here again albeit a remake. Unlike the recent spate of remakes, stand up 'Texas Chainsaw Massace', this is completely removed from the original. New script, different characters, different situations. Yes, they're in a mall and yes, there's zombies, but thats where the similarities end. A lot of people will probably groan and brush it aside, whats the point of a remake of a classic? I was sceptical on first hearing of a remake but after sitting through the full 99 minutes i can assure you it was well worth the time and effort. The first ten minutes lull you into one persons idyllic surburban life but this calm lasts for just that, the little girl next door just ain't as innocent as she seemed.  The following 90 minutes are a non-stop ride of violence and crazed carnage. The finale is indeed a rather tense affair and make sure you stay throughout the end credits! I was totally taken aback by what i had witnessed and if George A. Romero does indeed get the financial backing for his fourth 'Dead' movie he's going to have to produce something special to beat this fella!

I went and saw this movie on March 19th (opening day) with my POSSE, and we thought that this was AWESOME!  Since we were running late on getting there, we missed the first 5 mins.  There are alot things i want to say about the movie.....
  First of all- the acting and script were excellent.  The movie actually scared ONE (just one) of my friends a little bit.  In certain areas, it was freaky, but not scary enough to make me turn on my NIGHTLIGHT when i go to bed.  The ZOMBIES in this movie were the best ive ever seen; they were GROTESQUE, disgusting, hideous, and really FAST (at least a majority of them were).

  The plot is this- I missed the first 5 mins. so i'll just began where i started watching.  The population is being wiped out by an infection, which is spread by bites, or scratches from.....i think u know who.  Anyway, some people, who are not infected, or zombiefied, meet up on accident and take refuge in a mall thats closed down for the weekend or somethin.  Anyway, more people come and stay there (including some zombies).",1079740800,,1157,4.341121495327103

I thought the 12:30am showing on premiere night was a cool way to catch the remake of my favorite movie...(The theater was packed for the 12:30am showing but it was premiere night, as well as a Friday so I don't know if that means anything)I would agree with what the critics gave it, B-...The movie trailer looks really cool, and the beginning of the film is by far the best part of it...The sped up, a.k.a. 28 Days Later zombies do make for a more exciting film. I thought that 28 Days Later started off really good too, and then changed into this ridiculous metaphor about humans being the real monsters (The English soldiers wouldn't have cracked like that in just 4 weeks!), the same human=monster metaphor like they made in the Night of the Living Dead remake..

  One problem that I have with the both of the DOTD movies is why don't they wear protective gear like the father did in 28 Days..? One bite and it's over..Maybe some protective apparel might not be a bad idea if you are going outside...Duh..
  The remake is different enough from the original to keep the movie interesting..It's got some scenes from the orignal, and some fun new scenes too. Too many characters in the new film though, and not enough character development..Plus it really tails of into a standard but weak horror film...The orignal is more fun, interesting, and campy..The new one is a bit more exciting in some parts but a shallow remake..The last third of the movie was a big letdown for me after a great beginning. Still enjoyable and worth watching, but you will think to yourself how much better that it could have been done when you leave the theater....I am sorry that it wasn't all that I hope it would be :(  Fair movie, but wasted a great potential..The beginning and end to the film are just polar opposites in good cinema.

2066802,4,B00027SIUK,"First off, let me say how hard it was to walk into the theatre unbiased towards this film. Being a BIG admirer of the original I really, really wanted to hate this film.
Let me say, first, that it has been a thin few years for horror films, much less zombie epics. 'Freddy vs. Jason' was a disappointment, 'Resident Evil' made me wince (from it's crappy story), 'House of a 1,000 Corpes' was just a pornfest of sensless violence. The rest aren't worth mentioning individualy.
Now, on to this film, or as I like to call it DOTD2004:
The first 20 minutes are a bit rushed and confusing, but overall kind of fun. When the nurse's husband chases her while she's driving but changes his (it's?) mind in favor of slower prey, I was having fun.
The mall scenes were good enough, if a bit scattered. Some of the best zombie death scenes occur here; even if they cut away fast you can tell they're greusome. The back-and-forth between Ving Rhames and the gunshop owner across the street is oddly poignant. Mekhi Phifer has a tough role here as an expectant father and reformed gangbanger, but comes through to the very end - and end you don't quite expect.
The last reel deals with the remaining survivors escaping the mall and trying to make thier way to a safe haven, wherever that may be. Although a bit rushed it was clever in many places.
When you're dealing with stressful situations people sometimes make horrible, horrible mistakes and we see them if full color.
The end I won't give away, but don't go if you need a happy ending. Unless you leave before the credits start rolling.
It's not 'Dawn of the Dead'. But it's not '28 Days Later' or any of the most recent films. And that's a good thing.
Tonight, I dream of a zombie summer.",1079654400,2,1733,4.470031545741325
2066803,5,B00027SIUK,"To start, I am a huge fan of the original DOTD and I can not stomache today's lack or originality and quality in movies, television and films. At the same time, I'm not a snobbish film geek or crazed horror purist either.
 I was looking forward to this movie and not only was I NOT disappointed, but I LOVED every moment of it. It was from start to finish INCREDIBLE! I can't remember the last time I saw a well-written movie with even remotely decent acting (House of The Dead, for example,) and with what happened with the total piece of s#@t they dared called The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I was, like all of you, very worried with what would happen here. Apparently, if a movie today isn't written and directed for the SOLE PURPOSE of winning the entire cast and crew a meaningless little trophey at a God-awful awards ceremony, it cannot take a second to allow an actor a subtle momentary pause to reflect on what is happening around them. Some people think that being that passionate about a movie, especially a zombie movie (Snicker! Snicker!) is weird, and yeah, it is a little. But we have seen the results of what happens when creative people are pushed aside for ""Career-Entertainers"" who came into any aspect of this industry because they couldn't keep a job at Burger King and their high school counselor put in their head that ""You can be anything you want to be."" Sorry, but at some point in history, talent WAS a factor. The fact that ""Survivor"" is and ever was a hit TV series, Avril Lavene has a record contract and Hilary Duff has a film career is what makes this new ""Dawn"" a breathe of fresh air. MAYBE..... and that's a big maybe, there is hope left.
And the new ""Dawn"" definately follows in the footsteps of the original in the fact that it recognizes and voices many of today's social commentaries. Gun-weilding mall cops? Brilliant. Whether the messages are obvious or not, this movie is as honest and real a look at what we've become and where we could be headed as anything I've ever seen. I really hope George likes it. What I also like is the subtle differences between the youngest characters, the 20-30ish characters, and the older characters. Their innocence, self-righteousness and wisdom, respectively, and the tension between them, are what drives this movie. And again, it's what gives you a glint of hope that MAYBE the next generation coming up will have more to offer than mine (I'm 27) ever had. However, there was a trailer for something called ""The Mean Girls"" starring one of those Hillary Duff people before the movie began. So that, too, is a big maybe.
 As far as the ""Old Coke"" vs. ""New Coke"" argument? There isn't one. This story stands on it's own and in no way takes away from the original's impact. Alot of fan's shuddered at the thought of James Gunn penning this movie; apparently no one liked Scooby Doo (and you can burn in hell on that count). But I thought he did an excellent job and wrote a damn fine story. As a matter of fact, I would really be surprised if George Romero isn't delighted with this movie in the fact that some of the ideas we've heard him mention for his ORIGINAL vision of the Dead series come to life here. I don't see a competition, and neither should you. The new ""Dawn"", to me, can stand proudley next to the original without stepping on it's toes. The stories, as well, could have easily have taken place in the same time frame. (Well, aside from some of the OBVIOUS differences- the clothes, hair styles and ""What is it?"" ""One of those new indoor malls."") The cameo appearances by Tom Savini, Ken Foree, and Scott Reiniger put a smile on my face and showed the RESPECT the producer's obviously have for the original. OH yeah!!!!, the soundtrack was PERFECT. You'll seen what I mean.
I think what put the biggest smile on my face wasn't a scene in the actual movie, however. At the end of the film you are tricked a little and there is some fun stuff during the credits. By that time most of the audience had crambled for the doors, eerily reminiscent of the scenes we had just witnessed, when they all just stopped dead to see what was happening. I was still in my seat. Well, there were a few pretty cool ""money shots"" shown, and these two 16 year old Barbie-twin twits standing in the aisle go, ""This movie was like, terrible. It was so.... ewww, just...yucky. Who wrote this? (air-headed laughter). They must have been, like, snorting crack or something.""
Those two girls will have never paid a higher compliment.",1079654400,2,4499,4.546239210850802
2066804,3,B00027SIUK,"I was looking forward to ""Dawn of the Dead"" even though when I learned that Hollywood was doing a remake, I thought, ""Here we go again? How will they dumb down this version?""  But when I learned Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames would be starring, there was hope that this might possibly be a good remake.
And they try, but they can only do so much.  Whatever the circumstances, this ""Dawn"" is a pale imitation of the original.  Actually, it doesn't even resemble the 1979 classic that much.
The original film was stark, distant, almost cold, and there was a lingering amount of dread throughout, even the ending.  This new version is more pumped up, glossy and looks more expensive, whereas the original could not fall back on studio spending.  But the original's satire was strong, and this is where the new version fails to measure up.
George A. Romero's pokes at consumerism and shoppers was prominent in the original but this new version barely acknowledges that its characters even exist in the mall where they hide out from the flesh-eating zombies.  In this day and age of  outlet malls, internet shopping and reward and frequent flyer shopping, this updated version could have had a field day poking fun at these targets.  But director Zack Snyder doesn't take advantage of the mall setting, and the biggest letdown is his inability to poke fun at brand names.
The film does have its good points:  Sarah Polley resists the temptation to become a Jessica Biel/Jennifer Love Hewitt screaming babe, and invests her character with warmth and strength, and the audience genuinely cares about her fate.  Ving Rhames is also solid as the quiet yet caring cop.  And the supporting cast members try not to let their characters delve into the typical cliches of horror film stock characters, allowing the film to have a strong emotional component.
But even that presents the main problem with the film;  the imbalance between the human characters and the characters we are really here to see: the zombies.  They barely register in the movie.  Admittedly in the original the zombies were not as prominent as they were in other Living Dead movies, but their presence was at least felt - or worse, dreaded - in the '79 version.  But here the zombies have no personality.  They're not scary or even funny.  Snyder doesn't really know what to do with them.  That's certainly what made Romero so good at directing the first three Living Dead movies; he knew to make the zombies as interesting as the living humans.",1079654400,,2502,4.77906976744186
2066805,2,B00027SIUK,"OK, its not about a knee-jerk negative reaction to remakes in general. Remakes of classics such as The Thing, The Blob, The Fly, and the super-potent TCM remake, all succeeded with flying colors because they brought fresh ideas and technical expertise to classics that we all love. Not so here. This is no more of a Zombie movie than the horrid 28 Days Later. One thing horror should never be is a crashing bore. What is with all those MTV style quick cuts. You never really see anything, which is just as well, I guess. What you do see looks like hell thanks to the insipid computer effects. A total waste of time, except perhaps for the tiny cameos by Savini and Foree. I had to see it; it was posing as a zombie flick. It isn't one.",1079654400,4,735,4.333333333333333
2066806,5,B00027SIUK,"... Being a huge fan of the original classic, I was a little perturbed when I heard they were remaking it, fearing another disaster like 1990's remake of the original Night of the Living Dead, but after seeing it, I was pleasently surprised.
  Not only is the best Zombie movie in recent memory (with the exception of the original and perhaps tied with 28 Days Later), but it is also one of the most suspensful.
  I challenge any skeptic to sit through the first ten minutes of this film and not be convinced that it was a good idea. The suspense, special effects, direction, script, and yes even acting are first class.
  The story is very different from the original, with the only real similarity being the mall. Some of Rommero's more mature socio-economic and political undertones were abandoned for the sake of good old fashioned thrills, but you know what? I don't care! The film was made so well that it's few shortcomings are hardly noticable and easily overlooked.
  Many fans of the original feared that Universal would ""wimp out"" on the zombie effects that made the original so shocking, but fans will be please to find that they didn't. The blood and gore are easily as good (and abundant) as the original, sometimes even better (and more convincing).
  For any parents out there wondering about the content of this film, the violence is VERY strong. The language is also pretty bad. There are some short scenes of sexuality but they are there nevertheless. The atmosphere and suspense are also very heavy. Parents may want to think twice before taking youngsters to this one. I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone under twelve, and even then I'd think hard about it.

As a matter of fact, it makes me a bit resentful of the humor in the original, because this movie is not too funny. Try scary. I'm 27 and this one had me biting my nails. I don't care if the guy that wrote Scooby-Doo wrote this. This movie was fantastic. GO SEE IT!",1079654400,,419,3.883720930232558
2066808,5,B00027SIUK,"Well... as a longtime zombie fan, I must say that I felt worried when I heard they were going to ramake one of the best horror films ever made. But after reading about it, I understood the film was NOT a basic, simple remake... it was a ""reenvisionment"".
They took the original premisse and worked a new movie into it. ...Simple as that. In this way, I think no ""Dawn of the Dead"" fan should feel angry about ""new guys touching the classic film"".
This NEW ""DOTD"" is a completely new film with all the budget, effects and ideas the 21st century can afford (today, this film can do many things it was not allowed 25 years ago!). Like me, the real fans will still feel confortable enough with some references the screenwriter threw in just for our amusement (can you spot them all??).
Having said this, I have to admit I cannot choose between the two films (as many people will try to do) because they are so different in so many ways........ anyway... I do believe the simple existence of this ""remake"" is a great homage to the original film which stays at the cathedral it belongs. Thus, this new version will surelly attract a whole new legion of fans who did not see the original. In fact, it will bring a new (comercial) life to the original - as the Anchor Bay new dvd proves it.
Now, about the film....
I like it very much. To me, it is better than RESIDENT EVIL (which I liked very much) and better than 28 DAYS LATER (whose 30 last minutes I hated). Mr. Snyder seems to have a strong eye and a great sense of composition. His directing seems firm and sure. Many people may not know, but hes comes from advertising films and I sure noticed his strong sense of pacing.
I was also afraid this film would have an ""all-too-beautiful"" advertising look. Well, it doesn't. It looks real and well situated.
The casting seemed also like a good choice. While there are so much more characters than the original film, the chemistry between them, the plots and their backstories are nicely interlaced. I really liked these characters.
The major plot news is the fact that this film gives a lot of attention to the sense of confusion the characters go into as they witness the ""dawn of the dead""... and its massive impact on society - in this sense, the first 20 minutes of this film are some of the best horror-film setups I have ever seen. Yes, it has lots of scarry moments and you should enjoy every one of them!!
Need I say the makeup is over-the-top studio quality?
Anyway, I think this film is a terrific horror film. It is fun, scarry, fast, loud... all in the right portions. It should be seen without prejudice. Obviously, the film has a few details I did not like (which I don't think I should discuss here), but I still think this to be a winning project. I hope it film is a huge success and I hope finally Mr. Romero is given the green light to his project.

2066809,5,B00027SIUK,"The remake of Romero's ""Dawn"" is one of the great horror films of all time.
I hated 28 Days Later.  I'm sure if I saw Resident Evil, I would hate that as well.  I hated The Texas Chainsaw Remake.  So just flush your mind and let yourself be totally awed by great filmmaking, acting, an utterly unpredictable plot, and everything a horror fan could ever ask for.
Where to start... the opening is one of the great openings in FILM HISTORY, not just horror history.  The humor is absolutely hilarious but NEVER detracts from the mood or scares.  The effects are spot-on, and it is so amazing that this first-time director knows when to show gore and when to cut away.  The shots are glorious and artistic.
This might not have the mood of Romero's.  The apocalyptic atmosphere might not be QUITE as thick.  But it never reverts to pies-in-faces to get laughs, to quote a spot-on reviewer.  This is one of the great horror films of all time.  Along with Romero's.  So shut your faces and get off your knees and have your mind blown to bits.",1079654400,2,1035,4.452127659574468
2066810,5,B00027SIUK,"Hello,
I am writing a review for a movie I actually saw. I loved it!! I will not even compare it to the original, really, what's the point. They are completely two different movies(except the zombie and mall part). I love this movie because it does borrow the best parts of alot of my favorite Zombie movies(a dash of 28 Days later,and dash of the original ""Dead"" movies). There isn't the gore that the original had, which I suppose will disappoint some zombie fans. But, I really felt for this people trapped in a mall, and the poor guy on the roof of his gun shop. Mostly when I see horror movies, I can't wait for the characters to get killed(specially in grusome ways). However in this movie, I was really hoping most of them would make it. Anyway, I don't think there was much in this film I didn't like. I would recommend it to anybody.",1079654400,,842,4.369426751592357
2066811,5,B00027SIUK,"Just got back from the first showing of this film and boy am I impressed, as was most of the audience in the theater. This is a full blown action and gore flick that manages to throw in plenty of scares and humor along the way. I liked the 1978 version a lot (I watched it for the first time the night before I saw this film), but I loved the remake even more. If this movie was released under a different title and took away the mall as the fortress theme, this movie could easily stand alone as one of the best horror films in the last ten years. But since the main location is still the mall and zombies are trying to get in, it still has to be taken for the remake that it is. The Special Effects and Make-Up are done in old school fashion (little to no CGI) and are some of the best I have ever seen in this kind of movie. These zombies are fast, ugly, and creepy. Much more so than the few quick glimpses we get of them in 28 Days Later. Now for the part I feared most when entering the theater..the acting department. Let me just say that the acting is top notch for this kind of film. Ving Rhames is the Man and you will come to respect him as the film progresses, not to mention he can wield a nasty shotgun. The Bruce Campbell look alike jerk got the most chuckles out of me and CJ, the security guard tough guy, was good as well. If you want to see a movie with the guys and have a BLOODY good time this is the one, but please don't drag a date that will probably spend most of the time up-chucking popcorn in your lap.",1079654400,2,1530,3.986970684039088

I had seen the original years before and liked it, but i was in no way a horror movie buff.  So i went into this movie with no real bias for or against a remake  Basically the only reason i went to see this, was that i had free passes.  I was suprised how much i enjoyed the movie.  It was fun, had alot of action, there were enough dark comedy ""Get rosie O'donnel, no, thats to easy"", and a suprising ammt of character development.  The movie even had a few of the obligatory ""NO, DON'T DO THAT!"" moments.  One of them that drew a audable gasp from the entire croud.

Dawn of the Dead is a reamake of the 1978 horror classic. The original was all low budget and this one isn't, but it might be good. I really thought the first 10 minutes were really really good.

I was surprised by how different (the pace is fast and ultra intense in the 28 Days Later vein) the movie is from the original yet retaining all the elements that made the original great-a rare thing for any movie these days let alone a remake.  Die hard fans will like it as the director drops all kinds of tasty tidbits from the original (in one scene they show, briefly, a yellow and brown chopper flying off into nowhere-what could that possibly be a reference to????hmmm.) Surprises abound and the special effects are worth the money alone.  It will never replace the original but it will definately stand on its own as a horror classic (the soundtrack was good too).

2066815,2,B00027SIUK,"I think it is obvious to most observers that Hollywood ran out of original ideas five seconds after Edison invented motion pictures but what's happening today seems more like a disease rather then a cynical attempt to cash in on beloved films of the past.
There have always been remakes, I think Fred Ott's Sneeze was remade something like 40 times on its own.  But of late, there have been nothing but remakes and remakes of remakes
I think if this movie were ""in the family,"" so to speak, of the other Dead movies, I wouldn't have an issue with it, but from what I've seen, this one could be called ""Generic Zombie Movie of the Late 1990's XXIII.""
Of the recent zombie films, 28 Days Later put me into a 28 day coma, Resident Evil had some nice moments but it sure wasn't bloody or shocking or discomforting in anyway.  Moulin Rouge! was bloody, shocking, and discomforting but lacked any sort of entertainment value.  And no other zombie movies spring to mind.
At least when the Italians ripped off Dawn of the Dead, they did it in nice, meaty, shark VS. zombie, juicy chunks.  When Hollywood rips off an independent film maker, they suck out all the good bloody juicy parts before they ever make it to the screen.
My advice is to skip this movie all together, unless someone pays you to see it, and go out and rent a fistful of bloody 1960's and 1970's exploitation and pulp movies.  Rent the Toy Box, itself a rip-off of that one Outer Limits episode about the alien house, but god if it doesn't have some entertaining bits, plus lots of nudity.
When's the last time you had some good old unabashed gratuitous nudity in your R rated horror film?  Even when they put nudity in horror movies today it's more like that crappy MTV flash cut stuff or CGI.",1079395200,4,1755,4.46875
2066816,5,B00027SIUK,"For a long time I thought that a remake of DOTD was at best ill-advised.  The original has a ""lightning-in-bottle"" quality that would defy any conventional remake.  However, there are indications that this is a disturbing and different reimagining of ""Dawn"".
If the 8-minute trailer is any indication, this is NOT a a normal remake.  It is very fast, and very violent.  (What do you expect when the undead take over the world in one day?)  The trailer shows the complete breakdown of society that the original only hints at.  A human society replaced by the undead would necessitate a violence and horror that are only touched on in the original ""Dawn"". There is a tragedy at the loss of loved ones that we haven't seen, perhapse because it is really to horrible to consider seriously.  However, the sequel appears to wisely focus on these themes at the expense of the original's dark humor.  This is edgy and I like the riskiness of the attempt.  Perhaps the best aspect is that the new version works hard at being very, very unsettling.
What the unitiated don't realize is that the original ""Dawn"" was not particularly scary, nor was it intended to be.  The movie was an indictment of consumerism.  set in the then-novel setting of a shopping mall, our anti-protagonists are only marginally more appealing than the zombies.  They're self-centered and greedy, and their materialism ultimately leads to their destruction.  Unfortunately, the thematic elements and dated setting are lost on most younger viewers.  Think of show Bunuel's ""Andalusian Dog"" or ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligiari"" to the video game generation.  Most of them will likely be bored.
The original DOTD is of course by far the superior.  Up until 1978, there had simply never been a film as wickedly dark.  Now, let's let the remake stand on its own artistic merits.  If the movie flies, it will be remembered.  If it is opportunistic garbage, it will be forgotten.",1079395200,5,1929,4.861963190184049
2066817,5,B00027SIUK,"O.K fellow Zombiephiles, The 5 star review reflects my HOPES!
Clearly there is alot of debate on this topic- here's my opinion;
On the topic of Romero not getting the Dawn remakes budget to shoot his 4th film in the series: 1. George is very near and dear to all us fans, he has made some stellar fright films, he has also made compromised versions of some of his scripts due to budget limitations. Most importantly, he has made a few serious stinkers in his later years. There is nothing I would like to see more than Romero getting to make his giant zombie vision- Dead Reckoning. 2. Romero is going to make a nice chunk of (well desreved) cash on this remake. We all know he is a talented ""do it yourself"" filmmaker, so the better this film does- the better chance he'll have of making Dead#4. I am close to the film business and unfortunatly no producer will give scads of cash to a filmmaker who's last few films made little impact at the box office. While that logic stinks, it's the way it is! This remake is a chance for horror to be shot back into the front lines of cinema. As for all the fans who are crying about this let me pose a question: The Night of the Living Dead remake sucked very hard. Did it ruin any aspect of the original? NO it didn't. People still adore that film. Actually I am sure the original GAINED some new fans after the remake! Have any of you ever watched Carpenters The Thing ,Chuck Russells The Blob, Cronenbergs The Fly or Kauffmans Body Snatchers? All these are remakes & they rock awfully hard! I think fans need to think of these recent ""remakes"" as ""reimaginings"". These filmmakers are more often trying to pay homage to something they love rather than ""out do"" the originals. On the subject of originality; everything is recycled to a degree. At least Dawn of the Dead doesn't hide it's origins. The bottom line here is that whether the New Dawn sucks or kicks zombie a$s we horror fans win. Every large budget stinker that cleans up at the box office opens a door for a good one to be made. This decade is a time of monsters, we should be proud! Orc's & wizards won 11 Oscars! We had to wince through X-Men & LXG but we get HELLBOY as a reward! The fact that we will see Chainsaw Massacre/Dawn of the Dead/ Hills have Eyes all retold in a 2 year span says one thing: HORROR FILMS ARE BACK...BIGTIME! Expect to see our old friends (Carpenter,Romero,Argento etc.) making new films very soon! And lastly, support films like Cabin Fever, 28 days later& Haute Tension. Regardless of a films flaws (like the 50/50 FreddyvsJason), no press for terror cinema is bad press as long as these films still have guts! I haven't seen this much blood splattered onto movie screens since the 80's! Besides I can't sit through another month of romantic comedies...That my friends is HORRIBLE!

2066818,5,B00027SIUK,"Ok.  I am definetly looking forward to this movie.  1-It is not wholly a remake, because it is not the same characters.  If you notice, there are 8 or more main characters.  I do not remember seeing 8 people in the first Dawn of the Dead, I remember 4.  That means that it is going to be different in a $hitload of ways.  So I'm still going to see it.  Also, the clip that one of you all saw with a zombie jumping, I found certain sources and found that, it is a zombie hanging from the ceiling, not some kind of damn leaper.

I believe in this day an age however, many film producers have trouble with developing ideas for new movies so they build on old ones, whats wrong with that?  The only thing that is wrong with it, is if a producer makes a hunk of junk that puts the original to shame.
 I believe that we should all, as zombie movie fans, should give this movie a chance.  We really have no right to criticise it before its even out anyways, right? All I am saying is as long as it doesn't turn out as terrible as House of the Dead did, then I am fine with it.

This film looks like it will follow the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake path - straight to discount video heck. How much did they have to pay Ving Rhames to be in this?

2066825,1,B00027SIUK,"OK...So...here we are online, and as of this writing this film has not even been released, yet countless geeks and gore fanatics are jumping on yet another re-make bandwagon where, once they fall off, their legs will probably get run over and snapped like a box of toothpicks wedged between Starr Jones thighs on her honeymoon.
The idea of a Dawn of the Dead remake makes seems  to be a sure bet, financially speaking. We have seen resurgeance in this dismal trend as of late. Most noteably with the atrocious remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the resurfacing of the the whole Frddy/Jason franchises. Even though the latter claims to be a new movie, lets all face it; This is nothing we haven't seen before.
Now, one can argue that these films are not to be held in high regards substance wise. Afterall, horror fans want to see the gratuitous gore and cheap funhouse scares. That's all fine. I enjoy both, to a certain extent. However, a remake of a film like Dawn of the Dead is, in my opinion, a sort of a filmmakers blasphemy. Why must we retread such hallowed ground in the hopes of introducing a young new public to the gore laden spectacle that Dawn of the Dead is? The original was not only a classic B-class horro movie with over the top gore. It also served as a commentary to the materialistic society that was evolving at the time, in the mid-seventies. Malls were becoming more and more the norm in the spreadout suburbs that were popping up all over the country and it symbolized the fruits that the babyboom era had reaped. To see it besieged by flesh eating zombies was a commentary on the publics consumerisms of the time.
That will clearly be missed in this version. And lets make it clear, that while Dawn of the Dead is classified as a ""horror"" movie there is actually very little about it that was actually scary, aside from the idea of the living dead eating people. The premise was enough, along with the pulsating, one note soundtrack to give a sense of eerieness to what was basically a satire. In the original there was plenty to laugh at though, most noteably the clumsiness of the zombies. From viewing the trailors of this remake it looks like the director has opted to rip off movies like Return of the Living Dead and, more recently, 28 days later, and givin the zombies a quick and nimble attack. This may add some sense of suspense to the new version, but again...it won't be anything we haven't seen already.
Perhaps I am getting too caught up in the purism aspect of it all. Perhaps this may be a very good remake that will redefine how horror movies should be remade, but then again, if we really have to keep diggin into the old stock in the hopes of rehashing a classic for a new generation, then maybe something has to be said about the creativeness of this genrations movie makers. They have clearly taken the easy way out and replaced their own ideas with what they think will be better versions of something already highly regarded. Lets face it. No one has set out to make a version that is inferior. There is a certain sense of bravado and arrogance, albeit respect in the process of remaking a classic like Dawn of the dead. Perhaps, and hopefully, yet unlikely,the filmaker can include a different sort of social commentary that will reflect the publics eagerness to consume such  a thoughtless product as a Dawn of the Dead remake. I mean, they have already done it once not even six months ago. Perhaps that is the real scary story here. Is everyone ready for a remake of Halloween? Honestly, the stupid common public probably is.

2066826,3,B00027SIUK,"Basically, ""28 days later"" redefined the zombie genre...by linking so many modern themes to Romero's classic foundation (ecoterrorists who free the chimps, the SARS/ebola like nature of the virus, the soldiers reverting to savagery, etc.) the zombie movie was pushed beyond the normal format of ""some unexplained phenomena is making dead people hungry.""

  That being said I saw the original when it came out, I also hate to break it to some but two things:
  1. Zombies are NOT real. Defending Romero's flicks based on the fact that the zombies were more ""realistic"" is not only idiotic, it's inane. Zombies don't exist and until someone can bring one in to the CDC, whether they walk, run, jog, jazzercise or ball-room dance it's all a MOOT point. It's based on the directors concept of what works. ""Return of the Living Dead"" was a black comedy, it was funny and I thought having more ""animate"" zombies was far more terrifying than having the ""shuffling dead"". Please make NO attempt to defend your zombie fantasies, Romero admitted he took the idea from Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"". The ghouls/vampires in those stories were pretty friggin' animate and if you read the book (a rare thing indeed nowadays) it actually has a far more rational explanation for a world taken over by the dead than Romero.
  Your basing your entire concept on whether to see a movie because imaginary beings don't conform to the rules?
  2. I reserve all comment on whether the film turns out to be a turkey until I've seen it. ""Scooby Doo"", just may have been this director/writer's version of Romero's ""Season of the Witch/The Crazies/Some Like Vanilla"". Romero is NOT a god. The only thing he has given to film is an archetype. He is not a fantastic screenwriter/cinematographer/director/typecaster/etc...Let's all admit that he is a ""fair"" director and leave it at that. I have a feeling many are justed p@ssed because someone beat Romero to the punch twice (Resident Evil and Dawn of the Dead) and you know what?

8023347,5,B00027SIUK,"I knew they were remaking DoD, theatrically and no direct to video.  The mega hyping of major budget movies had really just begun and I had either heard nothing about the movie or that it was the real thing: A film not only worthy of a remake and reboot, but genuinely entertaining and scary and worthy of cinematic release.

It couldn't be true, right?  The zombie movie and fan are many things, but not classy, not anyone's magnum opus, unless your last name is Romero, not the salt, much less bread of major studio budgets.  I had been a zombie fan since roughtly ten years old, when despite the completely impossible premise of Night of the Living Dead, the sheer terror of mobs of undead assailants invading my doors and windows with a raging hunger for murder and human flesh, kept me awake until almost four am.  I was too proud to complain in the middle of the night, to parents who had let me watch it in the first place.  But the ideas and questions of racism, sexism, survivalism, dehumanization and the often blind, shuffling cruelties of so-called ""humanity"" have stayed with me.

Years later, using horror as a bit of cathexis, after a bad, or even grueling week.  A late showing of one of the Scream movies with younger friends was often preferrable to downing a bottle wine or several pitchers of beer.  And of course that made the rest of my weekend much more productive.

So when 2004 came along, and once again my duty to screen any and all serious additional efforts to the horror genre, especially in the zombie category, was called; I showed up in one of my poorest and most miserable years as a young adult to the more affordable matinee showing of this film.  An hour and forty minutes later, after a woefully unresolved ending, I walked out of the theater with the sun shining, some pep in my step, the occasional watchout to make sure that lady dripping her coffee wasn't in fact an undead monster misplaced among the other happy shoppers and feeling like a new kid again.  The rest they say, and the legacy of this film, up to and including last night's episode of the Walking Dead, is history.",1521504000,,2121,4.5380577427821525
