4296202,5,B004A8ZX1O,"I love this movie. I saw it in the theaters and I literally fell in love with him all over again. My friend Kristina didn't really like him before, but I dragged her to the movie anyway, and she said the same exact thing. It's like having an exclusive camera no one else sees following Justin Bieber around. Yes, I have to admit, I am one of those screaming crazed teen girls who would faint if I caught a glimpse of him. But seriously, this was a very good movie. I almost (I'm ashamed to admit it) cried at the end because I didn't want it to end. :P I personally think documentaries are very boring, but this was the most action filled, boy filled, best documentary I've ever seen. I'm a book dork, and I've read the Twilight Saga and the Harry Potter series and seen all the movies and read all the novellas but I have to say, this movie tops them all. I loved it so much, I am going to buy it ASAP. If you hate Justin Bieber, all I'm asking is to watch this movie. If you hate it, fine. But you can't understand who he really is, and respect him for his talent (and abnormally high voice) until you've seen this. When I first saw Justin Bieber, I disliked him very much. But the more I listened to his music, and the more I learned him, (and cyber-stalked) I learned what an amazing person he is. I would watch this movie every day if I could. I don't care if I went off topic, but just think about what you're gonna say about him. Sorry if reading this has been a waste of your time. But I hope not. Have a nice day! :)

4296203,5,B004A8ZX1O,"I really enjoyed this movie- the effects were AMAZING and in 3D I felt like I was at a JB concert. However, I think an hour and 45 minutes was a good length. Although I would definitely enjoy 9 hours of Justin footage, the rest of the un-superfans out there would NOT agree. This duration made it enjoyable for those who aren't big fans, and left the huge fans wanting more, hence the Director's Fan Cut. Either way, I was impressed by Never Say Never and would definitely recommend it.",1300492800,47,486,4.411111111111111
4296204,5,B004A8ZX1O,"Even if you are not a Justin Bieber fan this is a good movie to see because it inspires you to never give up your dreams cause one day they will come true if you never give up. Also there is a lot of cool guest-stars like Usher, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg,and more.",1300320000,13,259,4.0
4296205,4,B004A8ZX1O,"My family is looking forward to this release.  This movie is an excellent look into the life and development of a young talented entertainer.  Like Justin Bieber, I hope my sons follow their dreams and become wonderful role models.",1300233600,,231,4.897435897435898
4296206,3,B004A8ZX1O,"It is very painful to watch ONLY 15 MINUTES FROM THE HISTORIC CONCERT AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AND AN INTERRUPTED PERFORMANCE OF ""SOMEBODY TO LOVE"" WITH JUSTIN AND USHER. Director Chu said he had 9 hours of film footage of this gifted teenager, yet this DVD is only 1 hour and 45 minutes long. I have ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" each on a single DVD and each one is over 3 hours long.and a 3 disc special edition with all 9 hours is definitely called for, at an affordable price, like the 3 disc special edition of ""Avatar"" since talent like this only comes around once in a lifetime.

For an hour and a half, this excellent documentary shows Justins parents, friends, and fans with numerous video clips from his childhood, many of which have already appeared on YouTube however. Also are short clips from numerous breathtaking concerts, but with only brief moments from such immortal hits as:""Love Me"", ""Bigger"", Eenie Meenie"", ""Runaway Love"", and "" One Time"".The only complete performances here are: ""One Less Lonely Girl"", ""Never Let You Go"", ""Overboard"", ""Never Say Never"", ""Down to Earth"", ""Favorite Girl"" (special feature) and ""Baby"", and an almost complete ""U Smile"".

 It is extremely painful to watch only a little bit of some of these riveting performances, and  on a DVD this supremely gifted teenager deserves better than he is getting here. Justins manager Scooter Braun has done wonders for him, much more than his father ever did, but maybe its time to also hook up with Jane Carter of Spectra Management since she gave us the magnificent Aaron Carter DVD's (3).This review is intended for those that know the difference between a 9hr. 3 DVD special edition, as opposed to a one hr. 45 min.sample of today's most gifted musical phenomenon.",1300233600,14,1749,4.82

He believes in himself and is supported in his dreams. Regardless of where Bieber is today, his story is an amazing one. The goal is to have a life plan and stick with it because there can be many distractions along the way.

4297431,4,B004A8ZX1O,"Last year, when my daughter (in Kinder at the time) exclaimed, ""I love Justin Beaver!"" I was so disappointed. I thought I had raised her with an indie spirit and decent alt taste. From before birth, we bathed her in the sounds of Weezer, Bare Naked Ladies, and even lullaby renditions of Metallica! So J Beib was a shocker to say the least.
However, when I recently rented this documentary for us to watch for her 7th birthday... I was admittedly blown away. This boy has real talent. And a work ethic that should shame most of us. I was surprised when I genuinely wanted to watch the entire movie. And, honestly, I am glad that we did. I feel much better about the endless crooning in our home: Baby, Baby, Baby, OH. baby, baby, baby, NO! Baby, baby,baby,baby,baby, baby, baby, baaayyyyyybeeee!!!!!",1370044800,,799,4.633802816901408

Justin Bieber is just another Teenie bopper, that in  10 years at the least will disappear into the crowd, never heard from again, his music will never withstand the test of time, I would not even purchase this movie or any of his music, I can figure why everybody raves on Justin Bieber's music and this movie about him, when really Jackie Evancho who is younger than Bieber yet has a hell of a lot more talent in music, I would buy Jackie Evancho's music Over Justin Bieber's music any day. I am not a fan of Justin Bieber I like  musicians who write music that all audiences like, Musicians Like Michael Jackson, and Sir Elton John, who are way better than Justin Bieber, Elton John Video performances outshine Justin Bieber, by a huge margin.",1363910400,10,1017,4.551912568306011

4297678,5,B004A8ZX1O,"Ive always liked Justin since i was 9 years old, and ive never left him since. basically this movie is about how he started from the bottom and how he rised into a successful guy he is now. alot of people hate him because of his music from his My World album(his debut album) but if you pay attention to the lyrics he writes himself in 2012-2013, its amazing how hes grown from One Time to Right Here with Drake.

When this movie came out a friend of mine and I were actually going to go see it as a joke. If we had, I would have become a JB fan much earlier. NSN is not, as you might expect, a 105-minute glorification of Bieber. It's a great concert film combined with a look inside his life, how he got where he is, and the phenomenon that surrounds him. Who knew that Justin Bieber is an amazing drummer, and a talented guitarist and pianist as well? It's these kinds of insights (and there are many) that give you more respect for him and his undeniable talent. I wish I could have gone to see one of his concerts on the My World 2.0 tour after seeing the energy and passion Justin puts into his performances. Great kid, great movie.

It was more like a feature film, but everything was real.  Hats off the the director!  It is a very entertaining look at the real person.  At first I wasn't too familiar with Justin Bieber.

Anyways-I never understood the hype with him because the few songs I heard on the radio were not all that good in my opinion.  While I didn't hear any songs of his while watching this that made me change my mind, I do have some respect for the kid.  This movie portrays that he is just a regular, sometimes goofy kid with some incredible talent.  He does have a good voice-just not impressed with lyrics but enjoyed hearing him sing other artists songs.  It does seem like he has some very grounded people in his life and hopefully they can keep him from being morphed into whatever it is hollywierd turns these kids into these days.  I actually got a little teary when his gramps talks about how he misses having him around all the time but that at some point you have to let go.  Very sweet moment and you can it in his eyes that he's a little sad about that.  I did find it slightly disturbing to see so many women in their 20s and 30s in the crowds during concert footage-a little creepy and the fact that his presence can turn a normal preteen/teenager into a rabid uncontrollable animal but hey whatevs.  Overall-not bad if you got time to kill or are just one of those people who'll watch anything once.",1359936000,,1323,4.281124497991968

It is a very well written and edited documentary/performance showcase of Justin and his music career.  As far as the movie goes, it was interesting the entire way through and the performances were entertaining.

I'm really not sure why anyone would call Justin Bieber talentless.  To me he seems like a kid that was born with a gift of music and performing, and ALSO got a lucky break, but earned it, and has enjoyed success from it.  Justin is not unlike any other artist that has enjoyed the magical mix of talent, hard work, perseverance, and luck to become successful, regardless of musical genre.

I'm definitely not a Bieber lover, I'm a little too old and male and into alternative rock, but I AM a Bieber liker and supporter of his work, and definitely cannot think why I would blindly be a Bieber hater just because he plays different music than I prefer and he has a little kid voice.

4297989,5,B004A8ZX1O,"Justin Bieber is someone I'd heard about, but really knew nothing of his music. So, to broaden my knowledge popular culture, I obtained the movie from the library.

The movie is inspiring and well crafted. It shows the power of social media and an extraordinarily talented youth. Justin's life starts with a mother who takes advantage of opportunities and caring grandparents who cherish him. He comes from Stratford, Ontario - a town where the Shakespeare Theater adds culture to the community. The film takes you right into his life, his emotions and his team.

He's discovered and rapidly ascends, but not without struggles for him and his promoters. His team prays for him - he has chance encounters - his fan base grows at an extraordinary rate.

The film is upbeat and positive. If pop is not your favorite music genre, you might just like this. There's not the ear-splitting din with over-amplified base that some less talented performers produce. You see Justin with drums, guitar, piano and a precious voice, that is treated very carefully by his voice coach and doctor.

Whether you are a grandparent or child, if you are interested in biography, music, child development, team players, dance you can enjoy this video.

Of course, you may be one of the many screaming girls who swoon at the mention of his name. Plenty of them are interviewed and some are given complementary concert tickets, which adds context to the film.",1336694400,,1434,4.88477366255144

After an hour of horrible music and fan girls screaming, my ears then started to bleed, but not in a cool way like at heavy metal concerts. Like a heavy metal concert, however, I started a moshpit and personally took on 50 Bieber fans.  After awhile my ear drums had enough, jumped out of my ears, flipped me off, and swaggered out. At first I thought this was bad, but I realized that now I wouldn't have to listen to his music anymore and I considered myself blessed.

Some songs were catchy and they reminded me of A-Teens, but I liked A-Teens better. His genre is definitely geared towards young girls/women.  The music industry will do whatever it can if they think they can make money and this is apparent while watching the movie. I noticed how Usher, who originally pushed Justin aside, went clamoring for a piece of the action when Justin became popular.

His story really was not that interesting and neither was the movie.  If you are a true true fan you might love the movie; otherwise, it's kind of boring. You'll be watching some old home movies, see some crazy fans, and be watching some of his on stage performances.",1310601600,18,922,4.767295597484277
4298299,5,B004A8ZX1O,"I will admit that I knew basically nothing about Justin Bieber before I saw this movie. I did keep hearing about him in the news and saw him on David Letterman. The perfume he was promoting sounded fascinating so I went looking for it at Walmart. They didn't have it so I ended up ordering the perfume from amazon.

So seeing Justin on David Letterman got me wondering how he became so successful and this movie/biography answers all those questions. I was amazed at how talented he was on the drums as a young child. I told my husband he had to watch this! So we ended up watching together.

I was pretty much blown away by the entire story. It reminded me of all the Beatles biographies I've seen. Yes, the screaming girls get to be a bit much but most of the time you could still hear the lyrics in the songs. I noticed that the songs were pretty innocent for the most part and definitely geared for the teenage heart.

But what surprised me the most is how personable and loving Justin Bieber is at heart. He truly seems to love his fans and goes out of his way to make them happy. This story also explains the power of social media and how you can reach millions of people in an instant. I like that Justin Bieber really started off on youtube and how he used twitter to rally his supporters when he went to radio stations across the nation.

This guy is really a hard working artist who has earned the respect of millions just by being himself. I was also amazed at how good he was on the piano, guitar and drums. It is like his talent knows no limits. Watch this and be amazed!

Final movie review

A year ago, if someone asked you who Justin Bieber was, you'd probably get a response along the lines of, ""Oh, that guy that sounds like a girl?"" Now, Bieber Fever is sweeping the nation. From Stratford, Ontario, Canada, one of the biggest pop stars was born from YouTube. This movie is a documentary showing the hard work and dedication he put into making himself the star he is. This young seventeen year old was not handed his fame on a silver platter, like most of Hollywood; he worked tirelessly to get where he is now. In a matter of a year, Justin Bieber sold out Madison Square Garden in twenty two minutes. Originally, Justin had posted videos on YouTube because some family members couldn't make it to his shows. Eventually people from all over found the videos and started requesting more. Scooter Braun, his producer and publicist, found the videos. He pursued Justin and flew him and his mom out to California to try him out in a studio. Shockingly, after that, Usher decided to pick him up and help Scooter produce Justin. From there, the mania began.  Jon M. Chu was the director of this MTV Best Jaw Dropping Moment Award movie. It released in theaters on February 11, 2011. The budget for Justin Bieber: Never Say Never was an estimated $13, 000, 000 and brought in $29, 514, 054 opening weekend in the US alone.
The documentary highlights his grandparents, Jonathan and Joanna Bieber, his mom Pattie Mallette for all their love and support throughout his uprising career. The entire movie, you're moving around with him as he travels on tour. His schedule was crazy. He did over 80 shows in one year! He visits home, which is his grandparent's house in Stratford, Ontario, Canada and gratefully, gets downtime with his childhood friends. The final destination of the documentary is Madison Square Garden in New York City. While all his crew members work for him, they are a part of his extended ""family"". `Mama' Jan Smith is his vocalist coach and is like a second mom to him. Scrappy, one of his stylists, is like an older brother on tour. By these people keeping him grounded, they have made the biggest impact on him.
The entire point of the movie is showing how he came to be who he is. We get to see his incredible journey to fame and see the road he takes to Madison Square Garden, which, in the entertainment business, is a sure sign you've made it big in music. Social networking is how he was found. Crazed fans made him big. They found him on YouTube, followed him on Twitter, `liked' him on Facebook. Throughout the movie he thanks his fans multiple times, because, without them, he really wouldn't have made it. The thing that's different about his fans then anyone else's is each girl feels a certain type of ownership towards him. A lot of girls knew about him before he was big, and they feel responsible for his success. Lovingly, clips of fans appear throughout the movie, showing how incredibly important they were in helping his career.
""There's gonna be times where people tell you that you can't live your dreams. This is what I tell them: never say never.""-Justin Bieber. Philosophically, Justin told this to his fans at one of his shows. This is the saying he's been living by his entire life because it fits his situation perfectly. People told him he was crazy for trying to make it, people laughed at Scooter Braun for picking him up, which didn't sway either one of them. By paying no regard to the naysayers, and look at what happened. Deservingly, he fulfilled his dream.  Everyone who thought otherwise was proved wrong. All you need is a dream, and the drive to fulfill it and anything can happen.
I thought this movie was really well made. Justin fit in some humor along with all the information, which made it very entertaining. I love how they show how down to earth he is, and how much he truly cares for his fans. Sympathetically, he gives tickets away to random people on the streets at every show who couldn't otherwise afford them. He wants to make people happy and is doing everything he can to do so. By showing this side of him, it really raised his public appeal. I really liked seeing how he got to be where he is and how hard he actually worked to get there. I think if anyone is not a Bieber fan before this movie, would be by the end. His sparkling personality is cleverly shown all throughout. It was really informative without being boring. This was a very well made movie.",1308441600,,4483,4.587281795511222

My son plays alto sax and I've seen the work, talent and determination behind GOOD jazz. He totally blew my mind! Watching Justin, you could see him become the beat, even at two. ""and there passes a firecracker.."" Energetic and what some call showing off? I could not disagree less. THAT is entertainment. Entertainment with spunk and positive energy. We need more of that.
This kid is an inspiration to anyone who thought ""I wonder if I could do that""?

** And To The Justin Haters ** you guys just don't get it. If you'd pay attention, you just might learn something. This talented young man sings to the feminine in everyone's heart.

4298438,3,B004A8ZX1O,"I do admit that Beiber has it going in the looks department & he comes accross cute & endearing. I therefore clearly understand the pre-teen girl craze which he has generated. These 'customers' are like dry sponges and will absorb anything Beiber-like that is thrown at them. They are in 'fantasy land' and at their ages one cannot blame them for their views & the light hearted approach that their lives should be. They will have fond memories of this era. His concerts are disproportionately populated with young girls, albeit not all pre-teens. Now don't get me wrong, I did buy Beiber's album 'My World 2.0' after hearing Baby, but & here is the big but; I cannot understand what kind of struggle they are trying to portray that he has suffered. He got turned down by a few radio stations & he was not signed by the first label he approached?! There are thousands of artists that have had it more difficult than Beiber. This does not strike me as a great 'overcome all the odds' story it is mean't to be. He is good but not yet great. His stage performances are very generic & his moves are predictable and not very creative. His songs are sweet but has not gone to that next level. O.k. so he sold out MSG, but this kid cannot & I repeat cannot be compared to Michael Jackson! Michael had more talent in his little finger than Beiber. Does he have potential, sure! But he has not yet arrived to be classified with the likes of Michael Jackson. I look forward to his growth and rise to greatness!",1305849600,6,1500,4.438405797101449

I am not a fan of Justin Bieber's music, but this movie was very interesting and entertaining.  I didn't get a 2 hr boring concert that you could watch on VH1.  What I got was a very intriguing story of how this dude became so popular.  It shows early footage of how he started drumming, and onto where he is now.  Take it for what you will, this is not something you'll think about after you're done with the movie,  but it's a good movie to pass 2 hours.

4298520,2,B004A8ZX1O,"""Justin Bieber: Never Say Never""  combines a rise-to-fame saga with exciting concert footage of the teen idol.  We see clips of the YouTube performances that received millions of hits and led to his signing by Scooter Braun, who turned Bieber into a hugely popular teen idol and performer.  The film is standard bio-lite, and raises a few questions that are never really answered.  What kind of schooling does he get?  How does he maintain a rigorous concert and personal appearance schedule?  We see his Mom a lot but his father only once, briefly.  What kind of relationship does he have with his Dad?

The one person who seems to offer Bieber some grounding is his vocal coach, Jan Smith, who appears genuinely concerned for Bieber the kid, not just his vocal cords.  There are appearances by Usher, Miley Cyrus, and Jaden Smith, who perform with Bieber, but it's Bieber who takes center stage for most of the film.  A countdown to a concert at Madison Square Garden is employed to build excitement, though it merely serves to interrupt and distract.  A highlight is a sequence of Bieber playing a drum solo that is very impressive.  He's very good with the drumsticks.

There are loads of extras that fans will love.  Several show the strong bond the singer feels for his loyal fans.  One featurette, ""R.I.P. Hair Flip,"" shows Bieber saying goodbye to his signature `do.",1304985600,6,1374,4.787234042553192

Really interesting and well-made.  Concert scenes are exciting and well-filmed; witty backstage antics are appropriately humorous.  Loved the bit where he wasn't allowed to go out with his friends until he cleaned his room.  His handlers seem a bit creepy but also seem to have his best interests at heart.  There is one Spinal Tap-ey moment where he's floating out over the audience in a giant steel heart, but at least it was actual-sized.  <- people my age will get this, haha.

I voted for him at the VMAs because I believe he deserves every second of it! he won that award and It made me feel good that I voted! His music isn't bad although some of it is directed towards girls his age while the rest is just really good pop music!
I wasn't going to see this movie although I wouldnt have minded, until I heard it was just that Good I went one day with a few friends and it really makes you think and is most defenetly an amazing picture! Then I went to see it again with some more friends who didn't believe and now do, that was the Directors cut edition which I must say was even better maybe they will release that but who knows!
This movie shows how he grew up always loving music and instruments but also going to school and having friends just like we did, he did sports, hung out with his friends and all the stuff we did hes no different just one day his videos posted on Youtube were seen by the right people at the right time and his dream came true! in everyway he wanted and that he wouldnt change anything!
Very good event coverage of his concerts and shows and also of the behind the scenes of his off time and life all around!
My favorite part of the movie is when he see's a girl playing the violin infront of the very same restaurant that he used to play guitar at and stoped and told her to never give up always stick with your dreams they will come true one day! just part of the Inspirational theme of this movie!
