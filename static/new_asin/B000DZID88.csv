8103052,5,B000DZID88,"Although some parts are redundant, I feel I received much needed information on this subject.  Many confusing points I had previously were made clear through watching these DVD's.  In all, if you want an in-depth explanation on this topic, especially if it is completely new to you, this box set will enlighten you.",1170720000,2,315,4.9245283018867925
8103053,4,B000DZID88,"This set of videos was interesting to watch. It does tend to be repetitive through the duration of the separate videos. Although this can be expected to some extent, it does lead one to wonder if the cost was worth it since there is very little additional information provided within each of the videos that isn't already provided within a single video. Two of the videos are essentially dedicated to the expertise of Henry Lincoln. One of the videos does use several ""experts"" to provide arguments to support the ideas and theories presented. Beware that the ideas and theories presented can be offensive to anyone who is a hardcore Christian. I thoroughly enjoyed the presentations as I have an open mind and have interest in hearing and learning information that could be viewed as heretical. I don't personally see them as heresy, but again, I am a spiritual person who was raised Christian, but I am not a religious person and don't support mainstream Christendom. The questions provided and the associated subject matter will make one think and potentially reconsider the philosophies that they were brought up believing. The benefit to be gotten from these videos can be the need to do some independent research. That is always healthy, especially if one is willing to go about that research unbiased and open to possibilities that defy their religious upbringing. Much of the information that was provided sparked my interest and desire to learn more.",1168560000,8,1459,4.983606557377049
