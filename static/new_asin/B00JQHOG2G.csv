8653309,3,B00JQHOG2G,"The story a young woman traveling to the Klondike to claim the bar and hotel that her dead father left her, only to find the man who was suppose to be running it had sold it a year earlier and she was left out in the cold.  Just a okay movie with a second class cast.  Tom Neal never became the big star they hoped and Ann Savage the same.  The storyline was thin and the film. while not being bad, would be called a B flick today.",1416700800,2,431,3.875
