8650520,2,B000BIUFBK,Looks like someone just filmed some home videos and dubbed it over with some very obnoxious music (literally).  At some points there is a graphic in the corner covering up a time and date stamp from the camcorder.  Very unprofessional.  The martial arts aren't even that impressive.  I watched it once and then never again.,1305849600,,323,4.818181818181818
