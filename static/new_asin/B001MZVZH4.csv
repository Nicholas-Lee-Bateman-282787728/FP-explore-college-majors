3704474,5,B001MZVZH4,"About the only movie I consider funnier than ""The Brothers O'Toole"" (1973) is ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998). Both have the same combination of huge exaggeration coupled with subtle parody, exploding film conventions of their respective genres with completely out-of-place dialog. My appreciation of this no doubt speaks to a twisted sense of humor and an appreciation of the absurd; of which there is so little in more mainstream comedy features. So if you happen to be ""Duckman"" off-kilter, then ""The Brothers O'Toole"" is a film that you should seek out.

John Astin's success the year before in ""Evil Roy Slade"" (1972), the other western parody on the DVD, inspired a sequel of sorts. Or at least a  similar extreme outlaw character, this time named ""Desperate"" Ambrose J. Littleberry. When not busy terrorizing citizens, poor Desperate is a henpecked husband. An almost unrecognizable Lee Meriwether wonderfully overplays his shrewish wife Poloma. It is definitely her signature performance and I laugh every time I think about what the Miss America pageant people must have thought about this hysterical portrayal.

The humor in both films is nicely twisted but ""The Brothers O'Toole"" is several notches above ""Evil Roy Slade"" on the IQ scale, which may account for it being a bit more obscure. O'Toole is the ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" and ""Slade"" is ""Support Your Local Gunfighter""; as an example of the same type of comparative difference.

For Astin this is a duel role, as he and Steve Carlson play the title characters; a pair of too sophisticated drifter brothers Michael and Timothy O'Toole. Michael is an unambitious cardsharp and Timothy is a small-time rogue and rou. They come to the tiny town of Molybdenum, Colorado (Molly B'Damn to the locals) from separate disasters. Michael has just been ridden out of another town and Timothy is fleeing the shotgun wedding bells and angry father of his latest conquest, Bonnie Lou MacClanahan (Miranda Berry who is flat out irresistible).

The town is a collection of characters played by a collection of character actors like Richard Erdman, Pat Carroll, Allyn Joslyn (the reluctant sheriff), Jessie White (the slimy mayor). Joslyn and White are especially good, as is Hans Conried who plays a financier obviously modeled on Cornelius Vanderbilt.

The main plot device is mistaken identity (insert ""The Comedy of Errors"" here) as Michael O'Toole is mistaken for A. J. Littleberry and thrown in jail. Michael's summation at his trial and a later diatribe about the town are simply comedy classics, as is pretty much everything done and said by Richard Jury who plays the town's greedy undertaker, Harmon P. Lovejoy.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1280016000,2,2717,5.092134831460674
3704475,5,B001MZVZH4,"1971.  I like the collector's tin.  And I like this movie.  Haven't seen the second one yet, but Evil Roy Slade is very clever with a lot of sudden gags that'll have you chuckling for sure.  Quality stuff here from a vintage year.  Betsy is a knock-out and there are a lot of familiar faces including that of Mickey Rooney and the guy who played the Nazi leader in Blues Brothers.  Other guys too whose names I don't remember, but John Astin as the likable Evil Roy Slade steals the show.",1275004800,,488,4.3076923076923075
3704476,5,B001MZVZH4,"I remember this movie from the 70's. I had never forgotten it and I was thrilled when it came out on DVD. I liked this movie so much that I gave ten members of my family a copy for Christmas. I have always liked John Astin as a comedy actor. The writing of this movie was superb. Some folks may find it as simple comedy, however I thought it was brilliant. It's a movie that will just make you laugh!",1269388800,2,400,4.0125
3704477,4,B001MZVZH4,"I am jazzed, gassed and just plain old excited about having found this double DVD tin of John Astin at his wackiest. I remember these movies from along time ago and I howled with laughter. The sight gags are plentiful and the side jokes are so subtle that you might miss them or get them 20 seconds later in the movie.
Of the two, the Brothers O'Toole is my favorite; The movie is definately under rated and under appreciated.",1268611200,,426,4.405063291139241
3704478,4,B001MZVZH4,"A good family movie, just funny in so many ways.  Made when comedy wasn't crude or vulger.  Enjoy the fun, watch it with a child for more fun, they relate to it better.",1266537600,,168,4.0606060606060606
3704479,2,B001MZVZH4,"I'm not going into the story lines, since those have been covered.  I just found these movies to be pretty standard TV movie comedies that did not have any real laughs.  They are humorous, but not that funny.  I did not hate them, but can't really recommend them either.  But at the sales price offered sometimes, you can own 2 movies for less than renting them, so maybe worth buying at that point to judge for yourself.",1252713600,,421,4.428571428571429
3704480,5,B001MZVZH4,"This is a classic western comedy, I feel sure that fans of The Villian will find to be even more original and funny as it was out years prior to the above mentioned. Star studded cast and running gag lines, you cant go wrong!",1245196800,2,225,4.136363636363637
3704481,4,B001MZVZH4,Great deal for the old fans of John Astin.... Not only the 2 movies but a great looking tin embossed box... WHAT A DEAL,1243814400,2,119,4.0
3704482,5,B001MZVZH4,"A classic that is long over due in DVD format.  See if you don't get the ""Stubby index finger"" song stuck in your brain for a while.",1241481600,,132,3.888888888888889
3704483,5,B001MZVZH4,well for starters i paid for 2 day delevery and it to almost 2 weeks for it to be sent out so i guess i'm just screwed on the extra fee i paid for speedy delevery. so i don't think i'll ever order from here again.,1237680000,,213,3.652173913043478

8322638,4,B001MZVZH4,"The transfers are what they are because they're from something that was originally aired over standard television decades ago. I enjoyed watching the movies just as much as I did back then, though. Funny stuff. Just don't expect HDTV clarity. The tin container is a nice touch and very colorful.",1457913600,,295,4.92

8322641,4,B001MZVZH4,At first I thought it would be too cornball.  But it gets better and better.  Actually a very funny movie.  Surprisingly good.,1408492800,,126,4.636363636363637
8322642,5,B001MZVZH4,Great Classic western comedy. [Evil Roy Slade] I have not watched the second movie But Slade alone is worth the money.,1389398400,,118,4.666666666666667
8322643,5,B001MZVZH4,My husband who is crazy hard to buy for loves this movie . We had traded off our motor home and accidently left his copy of it in the old one. Needless to say finding this on Amazon made a great surprise for him. The movie is very funny and good enterainment,1358553600,,258,3.980769230769231
8322644,3,B001MZVZH4,Evil Roy Slade is a fun motion picture. The Brothers O'Toole is a major disappointment. The metal container just makes the DVDs more difficult to access when you want to watch one of the shows. It's a gimmick that has no real value.,1357171200,,232,4.4186046511627906
8322645,5,B001MZVZH4,"Evil Roy Slade was a movie I grew up hearing about from my family, but was no longer on TV by the time I was old enough to see it. Now I own it and it is just as crazy as described by them. John Astin has always excelled at playing crazy characters and Slade may be the most twisted one. Somehow he combines dastardly deeds with an almost pure childlike focus that has to be seen to be believed. A good supporting cast and well written lines make this one of the best western spoofs ever made. The scene where Roy tries to walk without his guns is a classic.

The Brothers O'Toole is a light concoction that is an enjoyable, but forgettable way to spend a couple of hours. It has a decent cast but never goes for the completely insane in the way the other film does. I will say the cussing contest bit was funny though. Lee Meriweather plays against type and manages to upstage Astin a couple of times, so it is worth watching.

The tin is very nice and upon opening it I found both DVD's had their own shrink wrapped cases, so the individual issues are just tossed in the tin. That will be convenient to people who want to keep the tin separate for whatever reason. Video quality is a lot better than I expected for an early '70s TV movie, so no complaints there. Sound quality is clear and these are decent issues of now 40 year old material.

Recommended to people who like their humor off kilter and just a bit insane.",1352764800,,1422,4.220588235294118
8322646,5,B001MZVZH4,"This set is great! I only buy dvd's that I feel confident I will watch more than once, and that definitely applies here. I've seen this a hundred times, and I still lmao every time. The tin is very nice. Just excellent quality.",1287878400,,227,4.3023255813953485
