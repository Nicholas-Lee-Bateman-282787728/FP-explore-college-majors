8490361,5,B000M5DTX8,"I purchased the film Jud Suss on DVD which originated from a fine grain 35mm print in the National Archives, some versions other than this one are not very good in terms of picture and sound quality so the buyer should be careful about which one they purchase. The film directed by Veit Harlan was the subject of 2 postwar  war crimes trials of the director, the film was directly linked to persecution of the Jews during the Third Reich. This version does not have switchable English subtitles as the previous reviewer had stated, perhaps in error. However this version does have very clear fixed subtitles and the quality of the print is magnificent. The film portrays the newly sworn Duke of Wrttemberg (Heinrich George)who becomes indebted to the Jewish financier Joseph Suss Oppenheimer of Frankfurt (Ferdinand Marian). Oppenheimer exploits his wealth and insinuates himself as the Dukes Finance Minister quickly bringing the economy to near chaos. The local Council is inflamed to revolution. Finally Oppenheimer rapes the daughter of the local Council Leader and the populace will have no more.",1168646400,11,1101,5.082872928176796
