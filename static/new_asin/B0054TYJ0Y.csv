This DVDs is worth every penny",1419120000,,60,4.083333333333333
8457103,5,B0054TYJ0Y,"Dale is a master with the round knife.  Watching him use one in itself is very educational.  He also has many little tips & tricks that will help you make a better quality rig.  I still watch this video periodically to refresh my knowledge base.

I'd highly recommend this.",1391558400,,273,4.510204081632653
8457104,2,B0054TYJ0Y,"Purchased the dvd instantly noticed it was not available, litle later after ordering before i recieved I noticed it was available used again.  They keep having used copy's of something very specific?  Something that is normally very expensive?  I was glad to get a copy for under 400$ becouse i believe that is a little redicoulus but also wonder if I just got a pirted copy and someone is makin 150$ or so for something illegal?  Side note, this is a good examp;le on how Dale makes saddles but not ever one has there own trees and know howm there patterns are,  not for someone with a tree and leather expecting how to build a saddle and custom  fit the leather to tree. alot is template cut not actually fitting leather to a tree.",1318550400,,733,4.432835820895522
8457105,5,B0054TYJ0Y,"This DVD set is well mae and well presented.  These DVD's are not
for the beginner looking for instruction on building a saddle.
However, they present an excellent presentation on how a saddle
is made.  Some may be disappointed at the contents vs the price of
the set.",1315440000,4,268,4.5625
8457106,5,B0054TYJ0Y,This is a very interesting DVD.  I was glad to find it at a reduced price.  I will watch this repeatedly.,1313798400,,105,3.9523809523809526
