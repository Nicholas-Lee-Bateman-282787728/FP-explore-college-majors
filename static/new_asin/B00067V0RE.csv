8040091,3,B00067V0RE,"We have long had a set of VHS tapes with 12 episodes of the Beverly Hillbillies with the original music. This DVD set does not have the music and the shows are mostly too contrived, which may have been unavoidable with the type of show. We are spoiled by a collection of the best shows, but if you do not have any of the shows then this DVD will probably be enjoyable. The DVD contains 10 episodes.",1462320000,,398,4.181818181818182
