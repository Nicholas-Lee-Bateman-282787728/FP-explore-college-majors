1006536,4,6305300887,"Otis killed Paul!  Not really but kinda...great viewing for anyone who loves The Temptations.

Since Otis was a producer on the series, us fans are able to see recreations of pivotal moments in the group's history, with some artistic license taken of course.  Generally, I think that Otis is honest about how things went down in the group and the hard decisions that needed to be made, and, Otis isn't always shown in the best of light.  Gotta respect that.  I think they cast David Ruffin well, but he comes off really menacingly during the period just before and after his separation from group.  They took too much license with the drug den scenes involving Ruffin and his tragic end, which could have been omitted or done in a more dignified way.

It's a fun watch seeing the meteoric rise of an iconic group and the tumult that came along with the fame.  The most important thing that this series nailed was the music and it's showcased well.  If you've forgotten about them, this will make you remember what an incredibly talented group of entertainers they were and still are (blessed is Otis).",1504396800,,1101,4.66321243523316

1006634,5,6305300887,"It's amazing that such perfection comes from pain and tragedy.  Everyone knows the story of the Temptations.  Movie was spot on.  All characters portrayals were excellent.  I was blessed to have seen them in concert.  One thing is for sure, they don't make groups like this anymore.  If you haven't seen the movie, please do.
The generation today doesn't know about these sounds. this music, the vocals or this type of talent..  They don't realize most of the sounds they hear today are due to groups like this.  As for us old folks, this is a great stroll down memory lane when the world was coming out of turmoil onto better days and still  somewhat of a sane place.",1490227200,2,668,4.546218487394958

1006953,5,6305300887,One of the best music movies ever. I think its up there with The Jacksons and Ray. Made me discover a love for the temptations. Leon does an amazing job as the egotistical yet soulful David. I love D.b Woodside as The sweet and charming Melvin. The music numbers are incredible and the story itself is well-written. Full of life's ups and downs. The end is very sad. Love this movie.,1464566400,,383,4.408450704225352

1006985,3,6305300887,"This miniseries, I feel, should have been at least twice as long. The irony in this is that the miniseries as it is, is kinda boring. I think what went wrong here is that SO MUCH happened to these guys that when huge, life altering events occur, not a lot of time can be spent to really emotionally involve us. I couldn't believe when certain things were happening and I found myself feeling absolutely nothing, but so little time had been spent with this person or that person to become emotionally invested. Everything feels abbreviated, like the show was a collection of notes, ""we gotta have this happen"" ""we need to have that happen"" without bringing together something that felt whole.

Am not sorry I watched it--I have been listening to the Temptations since before I was in grade school and finding out the stories behind people who you regard as so familiar -- without knowing anything about them -- is really intriguing.",1459900800,,931,4.711656441717792
1006986,1,6305300887,"I would have loved to give this product a 5 star review since I know that The Temptations is an excellent movie, because I have watched it many times in the past. My review is for the disc itself and not the movie. The DVD that I received from Amazon will not play at all in any of my DVD players. Either a ""No Disc"" or ""Read Error"" message appears each time that I have tried to play it. Unfortunately, I did not try to play it when I first received it and now I can not return it because it's been more than 30days since I've had it. My advice is to check out the DVD as soon as you receive it to make sure it plays correctly.

Update**** Amazon issued me a promo code so that I could repurchase the video at a discounted price. 2nd one doesn't work either",1459641600,2,758,3.986842105263158

After seeing this film, I'm mesmerized.  What an awesome tribute to the music and lives of this ""team"" of musicians.  Their music will live forever...and maybe I really didn't want to know some of their backgrounds and conflicts as a Motown legend, but this flick is simply incredible.

No matter what you want to be in life their will always be test and trials, but that's what makes you stronger.  Being a leader also puts you in the position to take all the punches whether good or bad.  But also if you don't tackle your childhood demons they will carry into your adulthood and when you add riches the issues just increase.  This group despite all their issues contributed such awesome music that will live on for generations and generations.

Even their best sellers were great with a look-alike, song-alike David Ruffin. It is sad that health issues dominated the group, but unfortunately, it is part of life. GREAT movie.

1007418,5,6305300887,"This is definitely a great miniseries if you like The Temptations. The series is based on Otis Williams' autobiography, so the story is told from his perspective, and as a result, it probably does portray Williams in a more favorable light than was the case in reality. The series also does take some dramatic license, as is usually the case with biopics of any kind. Nevertheless, this is a very entertaining series, telling a very human story, and the music alone is worth the price of admission. Highly recommended!",1425340800,,518,4.831460674157303

Instead of some off the wall song no one could identify with?? .. and the lineup of songs, gave dates, I was looking for a video musical.. maybe a mini concert.. and  was again .. disappointed that there were no original temptations videos or songs in the that lineup.. it's all reading .. nothing to be desired.. I think they should do the whole DVD over..

1007624,5,6305300887,"I always knew about the Temps because of my brother ( who played their records and tapes back in the 80's when I was a kid) but it wasn't until recently I became a true fan. Now a few things to do before or after seeing this movie: 1. Read the book WITH the added chapters. Otis talks about why Melvin's (""Blue"") passing was done the way it was in the movie. 2. Do additional research. There is plenty of info out there about the ""classic five"" and Dennis. 3. Appreciate the fact that Otis took the time to at least put something out there that we as well as generations after us can enjoy. 4. Stop slamming Otis. What we fail to realize is: Eddie, David and Dennis were grown men who made their own decisions . We all know Motown wasn't quite right with the contracts for their artists. (do the research) BUT they had the choice to do what they needed to do to continue on with the group. They had people whispering in their ear about how good they are WITHOUT the group and their egos ""almost"" destroyed it. Had it not been for Otis. The temps would have stopped after Paul and Eddie's departure. 5. Paul continued to work with the Temps after retiring because of his failing health (the drinking made his condition worse though) 6. Melvin aka ""Blue"" is the epitome of ""Ride of Die"". He made a pact with Otis that he will never leave because it was hard to keep replacing people when the money started to get to their egos (Damon and Leonard). That's a true friend and loyal group member. 7. Paul, David and Eddie passed away on good terms with Otis. Now that's love right there. 8. You will tear up at the end. 9. Enjoy the movie 10. There will never be another group like the Temps. All we have is their music. Send some positive thought to Otis as well. He is the last man standing from the ""Classic 5"" and Im sure his sunset days are filled with memories and sounds from the days he forged this special bond with four men to change the world through music.",1419379200,13,1962,4.262734584450402

1008036,5,6305300887,"Love it! Love it! Love it! Love them! I purchased this movie over a month ago and can't get enough of it! I'm a huge fan of the Temptations, although I was not around in the '60s. (30 y.o.) I'm very grateful to have discovered their music and the entire Motown record label. I love you, Berry Gordy!: )

You have to see this movie if you're a Motown/Temptations fan. And the real Smokey Robinson makes an appearance close to the end of the movie. All of the performances are wonderful. I felt like I traveled back in time being at their concerts. It was an amazing feeling. I love the concert when they sang ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"" and David... (I won't spoil it.) Haha. Love David!

Gotta love Kid's (Christopher Reid from Kid N' Play) appearance as a radio disc jockey in 1958. You know they had to have a rapper to do those lines he did. And he nailed. I believe he did it in one take. He was the perfect person to play the disc jockey. Introducing a Jackie Wilson song he says, ""..he's reet petite, light on his feet, and he wants y'all to be loved. This cat's pillow's never dry 'cause he's got lonely teardrops."" Loved the rhyming he was doing!:)

Great movie. Hands down. There should be more Motown/legends bio-pics. There should definitely be one about Jackie Wilson. I absolutely love him. Buy this DVD. Not one minute is boring. It's three hours but the time flies. It should be four hours! Wonderful movie about how the greatest soul group in history (my favorite on Motown) got together and later split up and reunited again. Regardless of their troubles, they kept it together and performed like there were never any problems. They sang, dressed, and danced impeccably. The actors were great. And the music is wonderful. You will find yourself singing along. David's sense of humor will have you laughing. Yes, he had an ego. But his talents and voice overshadowed that.

I can go on and on about the Temps and this movie. I'm on my way to Mama Rose's for some short ribs and cornbread. Haha. (If you've seen the movie, you get that joke.) :)

 PS: Some ""older"" fans complain about how some scenes were not ""exactly"" how they really happened like the fight scene between Al and Paul at the New Year's party. Some people need to understand this is a movie. Some things need to be changed up a little bit for a more dramatic effect. And we know Melvin didn't pass away in his mother's house. The producers decided on this scene in the movie because Melvin had just died a couple years before this movie was made and they didn't want to portray the way he really died in a TV movie. The producers know what they're doing.",1391817600,3,2633,4.440993788819876

I love the singing and seeing how they rose from obscurity to becoming one of the best singing groups there ever was.  Yet there is a lot of tragedy here as well.  The rise to fame and fortune doesn't come with any guarantees of being forever successful and with no guarantees of no bad luck and no problems.  So it was with the Temptations who suffered many tragedies along with their many successes.

1008221,5,6305300887,It was great to find this movie on DVD.  I previously had it on VHS but when I found the DVD it was so much better.  The picture and sound were so many steps above the VHS version.,1372032000,,180,3.710526315789474
1008222,5,6305300887,"I did not grow up with THE TEMPTATIONS. In fact their music is before my time, but Im very thankful that this series was filmed for me and millions of others.

I learned that every band or musician has something in the life that we can learn from as a musician myself because in the end, they are human like we are.

After my brother suggested multiple times for me to watch this, I finally bought after it was re-released recently in DVD.

Im a musician, but regardless of the style that I play or the vast array of music that I listen too, this is a beautiful story of some of the most common problems in the music business which is the rise and fall of a wonderful group called THE TEMPTATIONS. The ups and downs and problems within the group which is very common and also the price you have to pay for success and not stop believin' in yourself.

My brother was right, this movie is ADDICTING. Despite that variations of the story from the real TRUE story that I read in other reviews, it did its job for posterity for me and is a real inspiration for me as musician to continue and be inspired by the wonderful music that THE TEMPS left for me

AGAIN, this is a very very good series that I highly recommend.

Other titles that I recommend if you are a musician are
WALK THE LINE - The story of Johnny Cash.
CADILLAC RECORDS - The rise and fall of CHESS RECORDS and discovery of Muddy Waters, Little Walter and Chuck Berry.
MR. HOLLANDS OPUS - A Hollywood movie about a musician that became a high school music teacher and inspired millions.
RAY - The story of Ray Charles.

I wish we had more movies about musicians like this to keep inspiring us so when we go through the hard times, we learn that others before us, laughed, cried, suffered and went through thick and thin too.

RATING 20!!

1008273,3,6305300887,Wanted movie for document purposes. Movie too campy and pat with Otis as the hero. Of course it was told from his perspective and because he had the weakest voice one can imagine why he'd kiss up to Gordy.,1363651200,,205,4.282051282051282

1008276,5,6305300887,"I can't tell you how often I watch this movie.  It not only has the greatest R&B music but alot of heart.

I was a big fan of the Temptations since the age of 14.  There music is just ""feel good"" music to dance to or to reminense to.  I never got the chance to see them in person, but they are by far the best Motown had to offer.  I like all music of this era but these guys are really special.  I couldn't believe the tragedies they all went through.  It was incredible that they went through these and still managed to entertain with so much excitement!

The coreography, the Funk Brothers music and the songs take me back to such a great time in my life.  I can't recommend this movie enough.  I even showed my children and my Mother and they love it too.

I do think this group will live on forever.  I know I can't get enough of them!",1362960000,,840,4.024242424242424

Even though I have been a fan of The Temptations forever I love the group even more each time I watch the movie. The music is great and the acting is flawless!

I respect Otis Williams for telling it like it is and for keeping the group going while maintaining high Motown standards. Otis reminds me of Mary Wilson who was the force behind the power of The Supremes.

These guys make me proud to be a black man.

1008419,5,6305300887,"What a great movie.  It was produced by Otis Williams.  He was there in the beginning (saw them all come and go) and survived it all, while he always kept everyone in a good light. The characters looked enough like the originals so there is no question who is who.  Even Smokey and Berry Gordy looked the part.  Gordy and Otis Williams (and Smokey of course) are all so creative and innovative.  I saw this movie a few years ago when I rented it from Netflix.  Now I have bought the movie, (picked up some details I missed) and it is still one of the best movies I've seen, and I do not like most movies much.  I loved the beginning, where high school kids are trying out on stage, and the first group up is the Cadillacs, doing Speedo.  What a great sound and performance. The entire movie is about their lives, ups and downs, successes and the problems.  The emotional ups and downs and ties between them kept me on the edge through the entire movie.  Very well done.

It's a true account of how The Temptations R&B group came to be, and then their trials and tribulations as people joined the group and left the group.

While Temptations music is great, I don't care for it, it's just not my thing . . . so I wasn't interested in this music, but I sat down and watched it to appease my wife.

I am really glad I did. It's a great story, with GREAT acting, and just really well done all around. You truly become attached to the characters, and at certain points it can be a tearjerker.

1008509,5,6305300887,"OK, SO THE MOVIE TWISTED A FEW EVENTS. I don't care--it is still fantastic. All the actors are great--especially Leon. His portrayal of David Ruffin is easily the best portrayal of any singer in a movie that I have ever seen, and I am an audio-movie buff. There were so many fantastic scenes that it's hard to nail down a favorite--but I do have one: The scene where they audition for Motown and sing MOTHER OF MINE. It's acappella and in my opinion better than any recording of the song.  Again--there are some other fantastic scenes. All the musical numbers are great. When I was teaching in 2002, I played this movie for one of my classes, middle school, and they loved it. It is timeless. I grew up in Cleveland in the 60s, right across the lake from Detroit, and all the groups would pass through and play at Leo's Casino. The dancing and the vocals represent a feeling, a real soul feeling. I taught in the inner city of Cleveland, and all the kids would be singing Motown songs. Too bad for me that two of favorite songs were not covered in the movie-- I COULD NEVER LOVE ANOTHER  and I WISH IT WOULD RAIN. Also, not mentioned and not given enough credit, is Smokey singing at Melvin's funeral-- a real tear-jerker. Smokey was just such a big part of the Tempts success, and of many other stars, too.

60s Soul music-- in my mind, the best ever. --Sam Yulish, author of WHERE HAVE ALL THE HIPPIES GONE?",1299283200,,1409,4.411538461538462

One of R&B's most influential, revered bands, the five men enjoyed overnight success and helped define the Motown period. Like many other success stories, though, this one has a dark side -- with self-destructive impulses and personal problems threatening to destroy the band's reign. In addition to capturing the drama of the group's rise and fall, THE TEMPTATIONS features eight of the classic songs which made them legendary, including ""My Girl,"" ""Papa Was A Rollin' Stone,"" and ""Get Ready.""

1008622,4,6305300887,"I am 37 and I first heard of The Temptations through my mother's record collection.  I first saw them in the early 80's when PBS would do documentaries on old music.  At the age of 12 or so, I considered any music before my time old and not something I should be concerned with.  While I knew that the songs were good, I just dismissed them as old-time music.

Now we enter The Temptations Mini-series.  I recall the day that this came on (I am still shocked by how many years have passed on THIS!) and it was one of the few made-for-TV movies I was eager to watch since the early 90's at best.  Before this film, I did not know any of their names except David Ruffin only because BET's Video Soul did a special on him when he died.  I did not realize the line-up changes, although I knew of Dennis Edwards.  I did not know about the drugs, suicide, ego and firings before this film!  I can only assume most people did not either...

Most people praise the acting, but it was ""ok"" to me.  Then again, it was a made-for-TV movie so in that case, I can priase it too.  As good as this was, if it had been a theactrical release, it probably would have been even better!  The good parts is that it was filmed at Motown at showed how the group came to be.  The only thing it seemed to have missed was the 80's Temptations with ""Treat her Like a Lady.""  Maybe they did not want to hire anouther actor?

I think watching Youtube may have gotten me back into this film.  I know just about everyone has this film and they always tried to put it in when I would go over their house.  Lately, I have been fiending (no pun) for this film again!  I ended up getting my own DVD.  I wish it were in wide-screen and on Blu-Ray, but we will have to see what they want to do...

After watching this film again, I realized that this was based on a book by Otis Williams - the most obscure Temtptation!  What I gathered after watching it again was that Otis and Melvin was portrayed as good guys who did not touch drugs and were clean-cut, caring people who just wanted to do the right things in life.  Every other Tempt was portrayed as out of control, egomanic drug addicts who wanted everthing for themselves!  Granted, David Ruffins's ego is something I had never heard of before this film, but I can only imagine how he was in real life!  I am sure that drugs helped to fuel his ego.  When a person writes a book, they have a tendacy to put themselves in the focal point (as he could since it's from his perspective) and make himself and HIS buddy Melvin look like saints while all others who joined were trouble makers who had to be let go.  Yes, it appears as if Otis was quick to pull the trigger on singers.

There is a cleary hate directed toward Otis looking at the reviews and some may very well be justified.  However, upon looking at Youtube and seeing the videos/lineups, they seem to coincide with the story that Otis is told.  The lead singers always changed but Melvin and Otis always remained.  So it is clear that Otis must have been in control so to speak.  I also suspect that since Otis let Ruffin go and Dennis Edwards came in and they still had hist AND Grammies, he may have felt that he did not need him at all and other singers can easily be replaced and success would continue.  Clearly this seems to have happened because leads kept getting replaced!

It always boggled my mind why I would see The Tempts with the little guy with the mustache but when I saw footage from the 60's he was not there and neither was Edwards.  I did not realized that this groupd had so much drama.  This film helped bring some things to light.  What I did not like about ti - and other biographical films is when they show things that did NOT happen!  If Melvin of David did not die that way in the film, why change it?  When people watch a film beased on real people, it would be good to see what actually happened as opposed to us having to look at the real history to find out if it were ture or not.  Sure, films are entertianment, but when they are based on real people, we should get those real events, not fake ones.

I am not sure is all scenes on this DVD are what aired as you don't watch something in TV and expect an edited version on DVD, but it would have bee nice to show that they had a TV show and to talk about ALBUMS that were relased as opposed to singles.  While long, the scope of the film could have been better.  They showed many shows that they did, but I did not get the sense that they played in large arenas or just how large and popular they were.  TV show appearances (not just people watching them on TV), magazines, papers, people on the street going crazy would have helped with the scope of the groups popularity being realized on film.  If they were Motwon's biggest group, I would love to have seen this being shown in the film.  It was mentioned, but I did not see it.  I know budgets are limited, especially for TV, maybe they could have named something bigger than The Copa?  You know, like where sports teams play at.

They focused a little on their reunion, but they did not get into the colabbo with Rick James.  To me, this was key in the 80's.  I remeber when Rick James had ""Superfreak"" and he said ""Temptaions sing!""  I did not know that they were still together!  I also though that it was sampled!  I did not even know that Rick was Melvins' newphew!  It goes to show that the entertainment world is like secret societies.  Only those with insider info can get in.  Those without have to fight to get in.

All in all, it was good.  I still cannot believe Ruffin had such and ego.  It may have been entertaining and frustrating to see it in person.  I would also agree that Otis may have been jealous of all of the lead singers and this could be another reason he keeps firing them.  They get popular - he get's rid of them.  The group has continued to have success despite these changes and people will always feel bad that they could not hear more from the ""original five,"" but Eddie and David's solo careers put them in the same position as the Tempts - looking for SONGS.

I listened to Eddie's solo stuff and he had some hot beats on his stuff!  David's solo stuff sounded good for his singing, but I guess they hope that his voice alone could make hits.  The Tempts did not become big out the gate because they were always dependent upon someone else writing them a hit.  They were more performers than artists.  Artists create and performers perform other's creations!  So clearly these guys did not know what makes a hit or how to write a hit.  They had to keep seeking out hits from others.  I know some will say Gordy had control, but the singer should know if something sounds like a hit or not.

This is a good film.  If there are any deledted footage, put it on the Blu-Ray version and wide-screen it!  I know since it was filmed on film, it should have had some type of letter boxing.  With the length of this DVD, compression artifacts are seen - especially on HDTV's with upconversion on the player.  Re-relase a Blu-Ray extravaganza with ALL know footage of the real performances during the era of the film and any and all deleted scenes.  I would buy it in a - ""heartbeat!""",1251849600,2,7228,4.2472487160674985

The Temptations is the greatest and all time favorite groups of all times.  Inspite of their obstacles and tragedies, they overcame many hurdles and struggles and kept it together for years to come.

The Temptations has been magnificient and a superb talented soulful vocal group of the 60's 70's, 80's, and 90's.

This movie gave us unforgettable soulful sounds and excitement in their performances.  They gave to the music world hits after hits.  They showed  amazing talents and showmanship, in originality, and in versatile  on stage.

The Temptations music will always live in our hearts and mind. They brought us countless songs, to enjoy and to dance by and to treasure  over years to come.

Even though I love The Temptations more than any group of all time and know all of the words to all of their songs by heart I still find myself a bit mystified as to why I am so moved by this movie.

I cry through the entire thing.  I cry for the happy parts (when they start to make it big) and I cry during sad parts (Ruffin getting fired from the group, Paul's suicide, Otis's son's death, Melvin's death).  What can I say; this film just gets to me.

Perhaps it brings back the memory of a summer night in 1991 when I was sitting at my drawing board working on a painting.  The 11:00 news announced that the body of a D.O.A. in a Philadelphia hospital was identified as David Ruffin.  I'll never forget the feeling of sorrow that came over me.  I was living in Philadelphia at that very moment.

The problems with drugs and alcohol was the downfall and death of many singers of that era, but still made a fascinating trip down memory lane with the Temptations. Every one of the original group had a memorable wonderful voice which was highlighted in different songs.  It made it heart-breaking to see the decline of the ""better"" singers, one by one.

I have all of the Temptations' records since they were first released on ""the Gordy Records label""--one of Motown's many labels.  I love the little-known early songs that were not included in the movie like ""Farewell My Love"" and ""Growing"".  I especially like the one that did not ""chart,"" ""I Want A Love I Can See.""  It got a lot of air play in Washington, DC in the early 1960s.  The movie brought back a flood of memories for me which prompted the flow of tears. I was a freshman in college when their first songs came out and rejoiced along with the whole campus after ""The Way You Do the Things You Do"" hit number one in 1964! Great movie, great actors and ""true to life"" characterizations, like the scene where their bus had a flat tire in the south and they were thought to be the ""freedom bus riders"" from the civil rights movement. I highly recommend this movie for everyone who is a fan of the ""Motown Family."" I will treasure it always.  TEMPTATIONS FOREVER!!!",1230163200,,1108,4.4504950495049505

Also good if just interested in some of the early roots and groups of this phenomonon.  It gives a look at a number of the Motown artists we all know about as real people with the same joys and struggles that we all share.

I saw part of this movie\mini series on cable one night and as soon as it went off got on Amazon to see if it was available.  I think just about any music lover will enjoy this.",1226966400,,505,4.175257731958763
1008732,5,6305300887,"I purchased the VHS version several years ago and watched it last night for the first time in a long time.  I remember having seen the movie when it was originally broadcast on NBC back in the late 90s.

For anyone who is a fan of Motown, the Temptations, music from the 50s-60s era - this is a must see!  The movie begins in 1957 and chronicles the history not only of the Temptations but includes a lot of Motown history as well.  The music is out of this world!

Because I'd seen the show when it was originally aired on TV, I realized that some key scenes had been excluded from the VHS; this was very disappointing.  Note that the special was broadcast on two nights at 2 hours each and the VHS is only 2-1/2 hours long, you can figure that quite a bit had been cut.  The pacing seems too quick on the VHS and you get the feeling that you missed something.  Case in point:  There is a scene that had been cut from the VHS that shows Paul Williams in the early years refusing a beer and drinking milk instead.  But in the VHS version, the viewer is unaware of Paul's uncharacteristic descent into alcholism until later when his problem is obvious and one of the band members comments that Paul used to refuse to drink.  When Otis informs the band (then called the Elgins) that they needed to come up with a new name before Mr. Gordy would allow them to audition, the boys banter names back and forth along the sidewalk in front of Hitsville U.S.A.  Their struggle to think of a name was the scene that was cut and I no longer remember which one of the group came up with the Temptations.  Anyway, that's just a small sampling of deleted scenes.  There were many others.

I was pleasantly surprised to read in another viewer's review that the DVD contains the full version.  It is well worth purchasing the film again just to have the full version, so I'm clicking this gem into my cart.

In closing, I think it should be mentioned that the movie was based upon a book by Otis Williams and that the story is told from his perspective.  Although I loved their music, I was totally unaware of what went on behind-the-scenes.  Sometimes fame exacts a terrible price from those who are unable to handle it.",1224979200,3,2205,4.34718826405868

I was disappointed to find that in actuality it was the VHS version that was cut, not the DVD.  Sorry I wasted money on the VHS version.  UNcut, this movie is a mustsee for Temptations fans.

In 1967, after a Temptations concert at the old Latin Casino, my buddies and I accepted an invitation up to their suite.  Although all of the group members we met were friendly and perfect gentlemen, I remember David Ruffin above all.  Mr. Ruffin chatted with us, played records for us, let us take his picture with us, was down to earth, friendly, and very funny.  I saw no evidence of the unstable and troubled David Ruffin who was fired between '67 and '68 who is portrayed in the movie.  He was the perfect gentleman that night with us.

I have the VHS version and was disappointed that much of the good parts of the movie are edited from that version, the one that I saw on T.V., so when I got the DVD version and saw that it said 150 minutes delivered I wasn't too happy, but now know that the 150 minutes it says on the cover is wrong, it's the longer version.
 I deleted my two star rating, and am glad that they allow you to delete your ratings, because I was wrong.
I definitely wanted the full version that was shown on T.V. and now have it, so I'm pretty happy about that.

I knew the price the would go down later, but never imagined the movie would be shortened in its re-release.

In this DVD version, which I own nevertheless, some of my favorite scenes were taken out:  Eddie Kendricks performing during his solo career; Eddie and David performing ""You're My Everything"" -- my all-time favorite Temptations song!; and the New Year's Day scene was shortened.  This scene provided the most insight into David Ruffin's character.  He talked about being abused as a child.

It is still a wonderful movie, no doubt.  It is just to my misfortune that I am unable to watch it without a little disappointment.  I enjoyed every second of the original version so much.",1181606400,2,865,4.751677852348993
1008798,5,6305300887,"I first saw this movie several years ago at my sister's house during the Christmas holidays.  I loved it, and watch it over and over again.  All the children in the family love it to, and we would stop the tape and practice the temptation walk.  They were so tickled at the wigs that looked liked bird nests.  Of course, I had to explain that they were trying to get the hair to looked conked.

The music, singing, and dancing, and the story line was fantastic.  This is by far my favorite movie to watch.  I never tire of it.  It has become a classic holiday and any time movie in my family.

The men where all fine as wine and so easy on my eyeballs.  The man that played Melvin has that black man, sexy walk that makes me want to holler.  The gentleman that played Paul could move those hips something awful.  Poetry in motion I say.  The Eddie Kendrick character who is just a cutety pie. Leon is sexy as he want to be. He was excellent as David Ruffin.  Otis the man with the level head.  It was truely an ensemble cast.

For folks complaining about it being fictionalized, come on y'all, this is a drama for entertainment purposes, not a documentary.

This movie is better than 90% of the commercial movies that are released yearly.  Again there are a few movies I can watch over and over.  This is one of them.

""I Know you want leave me, but I refuse to let you go. If I have to beg and plead for you sympathy, I don't mind cause you me that much to me. Ain't too proud to beg sweet darling.""  This is one of favorite songs and scenes in the movie with Leon.  Oh lawd, I feel like I am about the catch the spirit y'all.",1181001600,2,1627,4.1309904153354635
1008799,5,6305300887,"I say this is the movie that started it all because it is the movie that started my fascination with the Temptations.

Of course I knew who the Temps were. I had heard all of their most popular songs, but I was never a fan...until the movie. I don't even remember how I was first introduced to the movie; only that the reruns were always shown on Vh-1 and Vh-1 Classic.

No matter how many times I watch the film, I'm still surprised by how good it is. The music, the acting, the script; it's all top-notch. I'm also impressed that all of the actors, with the exception of Leon did their own singing. These are talented guys. I especially love Christian Payton as Paul. Unfortunately, I haven't seen him or most of them in anything else since, which makes me angry when I think about the fact rappers are hired predominately to play black characters in film. Which makes me wonder why Brad Pitt will never fear losing his job to Axl Rose, but Leon will always have to fear losing his job to Snoop Dogg: another debate for another day.

A lot of folk have issues with the creative license the writers and producers took with the movie. Because I wasn't aware of the Temptations history (and to a large degree, still don't) until after I saw the film, I really have no problem with it. All movies change things. That's the nature of the celluloid beast. However, there is one omission they make that I feel would have better helped the viewer understand the story: the fact Paul had sickle-cell anemia. Why omit this? This would make it clear it wasn't just his drinking that ended his career. Also, the movie should have used more ambiguity regarding Paul's death considering the real events were so suspicious.

I also don't like the claim that because the movie is based on Otis William's viewpoint, that he somehow exaggerated the shortcomings of the other members and embellished his own virtues.

For the record, Melvin comes out as being the most well-behaved member in the movie, not Otis. And secondly, has anyone stopped to ponder that maybe Otis WAS better behaved and less inclined to indulge in vices than the other members? There is a reason why he's still alive in 2007 while the other members are dead. He must have been doing something right in regards to lifestyle. Third, the movie makes it clear not only is he an adulterer but also two-faced. So how does he come off as an angel? Fourth, the movie is not a play by play on Otis William's book, and he did not have creative control over the movie.

I believe every one in the movie was good.  But LEON has got to have a special mention.  His is one of the best performances I have seen of a real life person on the screen. He is just as good if not better then Laurence Fishburn as Ike Turner or Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison or Ralph Bellamy as FDR  And once again if this movie had been slimmed down a little and made a theatrical release I wonder if Leon would have gotten a nomination from the Academy.

This was originally a 2 part movie but is always shown in it's entirety on VH-1. I also have it on DVD.  Take a look and you will witness a made for TV that will rival any big screen biop with a performance from Leon that is a revelation. I have seen this actor in bad movies but I have never seen him  put on a bad performance. He was in  another good movie the Five Heartbeats in a similer role and he was a show stopper.

To have a movie made about one of the most popular groups in history is amazing.  The actors that portrayed the Temptations did an outstanding job! Especially Charles Malik Whitfield who played as Otis Williams (the founder of the group), Terron Brooks as Eddie Kendricks (who actually did his own singing in the movie), D.B. Woodside as Melvin Franklin and most definitely Leon as David Ruffin. All the actors did such a wonderful job that you would actually thought that they were really the Temptin' Temptations. I have enjoyed The Temptations ever since I was a little girl.  I remember ordering their music when I was nine years old! And if you ever get a chance, buy the book by Otis Williams. You would be glad that you did.  I have watched this movie so many times that I have bought it several times to make sure that I would never lose it. This movie makes you believe that you were there watching them perform. In the book ""Temptations"" written by Otis Williams he mentioned the scene when David Ruffin (played by Leon)wanted the group's name to be changed to David Ruffin & The Temptations. Otis Williams indicated that Leon's (whose appearance actually frightened him)

portrayal of David Ruffin and that scene was like reliving that moment. The scene that makes me happy but also sad is at the end when they sing ""My Girl"". Even up to this day, when I hear ""My Girl"", I feel David Ruffin's spirit. And even when I think about that song, I can actually hear David singing it and to know that David Ruffin,(these very talented men)

Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams and Melvin Franklin died tragically, it is a sadness that I can't explain. David Ruffin died from an overdose of drugs, Eddie Kendricks of cancer, Paul Williams committed suicide by a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head, and Melvin Franklin from a brain hemorrage who was also diabetic and had other health problems.  These men help Otis Williams bring joy and happiness to so many people's lives (and mine)that the songs and the memories is something I will never forget. Otis Williams said that he hasn't seen the movie yet. And trying to look at it from his point of view, I can understand why.  He loved them all as though they were his actual brothers and as far as Otis Williams is concerned, they are his brothers and he loved them deeply and so do I. This movie will make you laugh, cry and cherish it for a very long time and you will watch it over and over. I'm sure that David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams & Melvin Franklin are in heaven smiling at every one who watched this movie and loving and also thanking Otis Williams for letting them share in a special moment in time that changed music history forever and bringing some happiness in the lives of people and also allowing us to see the special talent that God had given them.

Even the crowds of fans are good.  It's hard to capture the excitement of live performance on film, and in this movie, you feel what it must be like to be a performer, the good and the bad.  I plan to sit down and count all the songs that are woven through the movie, for what you get this movie is worth every penny -- I put on the tape and listen to it several days a week.  Sometimes I watch ""Shout"" David Ruffin's first performance with The Temptations in the film three times in a row.  The energy makes me glad to be alive.

It's rare to see such a display of the love of music, it's evident in almost every moment of the film. I can't thank everyone involved enough.  I've ordered the DVD and another tape, just to make sure I never lose it.

This movie may not be perfect, but it makes me feel good, and I have been on the internet researching like crazy because it makes me want to know more.

Yes, it's a story of The Temptations but it's more than just a story...these guys were, and still are, a masterpiece in music. They conquered odds unlike anything you see today and they did it with dignity and pride. Yes, there were times when things went a bit haywire but the group maintained it's level of great music and entertainment. The acting is superb! The songs they perform bring back such good memories.

This is one DVD that will remain in my collection forever. If you're a fan of Motown you'll love this DVD. If you're not a fan, you will be one after watching this.

1008936,5,6305300887,"This is a lengthy, made for television, feature film that runs nearly three hours. The time will zoom by, as this is an engaging, well-acted production about one of Motown's earliest successes, ""The Temptations"".  The story of this group is told primarily through the eyes of Otis Williams, one of its founding fathers and the true linchpin of the group, as well as its last surviving member. The film details the group's struggle for success from its down and out early days to the pinnacle of success and its eventual induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The songs that propelled  ""The Temptations"" to stardom are capably lip-synched by its talented cast. The viewer sees the beginning of the group in the nineteen fifties and its subsequent rise to fame and fortune. After being signed up by Motown, the future of ""The Temptations""  was almost assured, given the resources that Motown's music mogul, Barry Gordy,  allotted to their development. Once they were a success, crossover was inevitable for such a talented group, and ""The Temptations"" became a huge hit in mainstream America.

The film details the personal highs and lows of the individual members of the group. Alcoholism, drug use, egotism, and other personal travails would plague its members and, consequently, the group. At times, the group would appear to be on the verge of a total split, especially when its cocaine craving, lead singer, David Ruffin,  began making ego fueled demands. Still, the temptations endured, because no one member was bigger than the group. They began as a group, and it is the group that would endure. Though individual members would come and go, the group itself always remained  ""The Temptations"".

This is an excellent bio pic with great music. It is a film that is worthy of being in one's personal collection.",1141516800,47,1823,4.931372549019608

You'll feel the excitement of them starting out and how they become their best when David Ruffin joins the group, to sadness at how ego's, alcohol, drugs and health problems tear them apart. The cast was Great, you feel as if you're watching the real Temptations, the songs Great,and after the emotional rollercoaster when there's only Otis left, the ending of them singing MY GIRL when they were at their best was a great way to end the movie.

movies I've ever seen, on the large or small screen!  Very well

written, engrossing, uplifting, sad, funny and just plain great.

All of the actors portraying the Tempts are fantastic, including

the ""original five"" and then Dennis Edwards, Richard Street, etc.

The musical numbers are very well performed and directed with

lots of verve.  Some of the songs are the original recordings,

some are new recordings that sound very very much like the

real group.  I was particularly moved by the actor who played

Melvin Franklin, who seemed like the real ""softie"" of the group.

He appears to have had a huge heart and a real spirit.  Also

amazing was Leon as David Ruffin.  Just a blazing performance.

But all of the guys were wonderful.  If you are remotely inter-

ested in what we used to call Soul Music and its origins, I

highly recommend this colorful, engaging film.  ONE NOTE:  If

you saw this on TV and were concerned that some footage was cut

for the DVD, fear not.  It is complete and in tact.  The box

says ""150 minutes"", but it's actually around 175 minutes, just

THE TEMPTATIONS is worthy of repurchase on DVD to replace the VHS. The DVD is 24 minutes longer (174 total)! Sadly, it contains more profanity and drug related scenes but includes dialog that fills out the story. The woman in the crack house differs from VHS to DVD. Additionally, the DVD songs appear to have intentional distortion (volume decreases and increases intermittently) perhaps to protect over a dozen digital music recordings from audio duplication. The DVD also credits the actor portraying David Ruffin with his first and last name whereas the VHS credits him as ""Leon.""

Remastering of the live songs (on the VHS) is better than the originals I later purchased on CD. (You'll probably go out and buy the anthology too after watching the film.) Is the soundtrack available?

Movie quote: ""Ain't nobody comin' to see you, Otis! You wish you could work it the way I do, but you can't!""",1115856000,5,1146,4.836734693877551
1008992,3,6305300887,"First off, I would like to give my hat off to Eddie Kendricks, Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, Dennis Edwards and the one and only David Ruffin for making the Temptations the greatest male group of all time. Even though I never met you guys and you left either before I was born or was almost too young to really know about y'all, I miss you.

Second, HOW DARE OTIS WILLIAMS make a movie that focused on the ""screw-ups"" by his ""brothers"" and yet he portrayed himself and Melvin as ""the good guys"". I'm sure Melvin was the best person to be around but I hear about Otis being a snake and snitch and I think Melvin wasn't even that much of a passive man either. Over the years since I've watched it, I've gotten more of an appreciation for their music than for the story that was shown. Nothing in the movie added up to anything.

For instance, the lead singer of Otis Williams & the Distants was Richard Street, who ironically sung co-lead for the Temptations from 1971 to 1992. Also, the Primes were actually THREE band members - Eddie, Paul and Kel Williams. Third, there was never a RIVALRY between the Primes and Distants as far as I know though people could tell you that Paul had a problem with Elridge. Also, it was Otis, not Melvin, who got Eddie and Paul to form the group that became the Temptations. What's the matter, Otis? You didn't want to take credit for something you actually did right? Also, when did the Primes and Primettes perform together? NEVER! Plus, there were FOUR Primettes (Diane Ross, Florence ""Flo"" Ballard (or Blondie), Mary Wilson and Betty McGlown) and they dressed in school uniforms or sock hops, not the glamorous dresses that were in the movie. Also, Otis cheated with Josephine on not only Flo but he fooled around with Patti Labelle. He was never a faithful husband or father, as Lamont told him during a basketball game.

The confusion over what caused Eldridge ""Al"" to leave can be solved here - Paul was the one tired of a show and wanted to rest. Al wanted to go back out there and Paul said ""we'll all be wasted"" and Al got mad and threw a beer bottle at Paul (I think it hit his face unlike the version shown in the movie). But he wasn't fired quickly or he didn't quit after that. It was actually at a Motown CHRISTMAS party where Al and Paul got at it again and after being warned by the others, Al suddenly bolted. Who knows if David performed with them afterwards at another party but what is clear is that David Ruffin signed a contract to officially state he was the new member of the Temptations. The boys didn't assign David, he had to have a contract as did Cindy Birdsong when she joined the Supremes. They couldn't just assign singers now that they were under a label.

Little is known of Al and he's only shown one more time at a bar drinking in misery after seeing his old friends become superstars without him. He did have a family and all and when he died, he was survived by his wife and kids. Anyway, onto more of this mixed-up story. What I didn't get is how the movie portrayed the bad sides of David, Eddie and Paul as if they had a streak and Otis didn't. In fact, David's volatile nature after the Tempts became superstars was only one third of how Mr. Ruffin was. My favorite scene in the movie is actually when David is confronted by Otis and Melvin over missing dates in concerts and recording sessions (I don't even think he missed most of them, he might've been late to some, but hey) and when Otis said ""they come to see us"" and David shot back ""they're not coming to see YOU, Otis"", I fell out laughing. And really, you can sense Otis still has a deep sense of jealousy for David and Eddie because they were in fact THE voices of the Tempts as they said. It wasn't not like an ego trip, it's the actual truth. Melvin was the bass, Paul was the heart and soul and Eddie & David were the voices. Dennis was, of course, the grit. But Otis? He was... he was... uh... oh yeah that's right, a lap dog to Berry Gordy.

Anyway, I also didn't like how Eddie was seen as this punk who whined about this and that. From what I got in fan accounts of the man, he was probably the most well-aware and independent member of the group. He had opinions and he could tango with you if you dare him. The way he was perceived vocally was also disrespectful. Eddie Kendricks was a falsetto AND second tenor. He in fact can sing in a deeper tone. He sure paved the way for Phillip Bailey. Eddie was also one of the group's only songwriters during their '60s period. Eddie has been getting disrespected for many years, it's really unfair of how he was treated especially at the end of the movie as he was ""a footnote"" when Mama Rose Franklin asked what had happened to Eddie. The world? I mean, what's up with ""what was it that got Eddie?"" LIKE EDDIE WASN'T EVEN IMPORTANT OR SOMETHING TO HIM!?!

Also, Dennis Edwards and David Ruffin had a profound respect for each other. In fact, David himself let it be known that Dennis was to replace him. I don't even know if David went into a temper after learning of his departure from the group. He probably knew his ego and his dreams were getting in the way and he just saw it as a way to go solo ""but I'll be back"" in a sense. And in certain times, the group did introduce David to sing with them on certain times. Otis was always jealous with David for obvious reasons. I'm sure they fought but Otis probably encouraged it. It's like he was a bully talking about ""nyah, nyah, I got you out of my group"".

Which leads me to the saccharine scene of Otis and his cancer-riddled mommy talking. When his mom told him he was not only a success as a singer but also a success as a ""man"", I almost hurled. This just let me to believe Otis really cared about himself. No way did he handle himself like a man. And I also didn't like how they had Mama Rose saying Otis kept ""the family together"". No matter how much he did to keep the group franchise afloat, the ""family"" was really him, Melvin (or ""Blue""), David, Paul and Eddie. And the ""family"" never recovered after Paul's 1973 death, which to some, remains a mystery. We're still left to say that Paul committed suicide after a drunken stupor. They set the scene up beautifully but after I read something about Paul ACTUALLY GETTING WELL and WANTING TO WORK ON MUSIC, I got ticked off.

Now I'm less convinced that Paul wanted to kill himself even if he was a drunk or not (Eddie, I think, said Paul was really working on recovery). Plus, even when he got kicked out of the group, Paul STILL was giving the band choreography lessons. So something about the Paul Williams story in the movie led me with a bad taste in my mouth especially when it was shown only two Temptations were seen at the funeral when all the members were there to give their final respects to him. And also, Paul had a crippling disease that forced him out of the group, it sure as hell wasn't drinking. Because if it was alcoholic problems, then that's just foul. You could've least gave the dude HELP or sent him into DETOX... OTIS or BERRY or SHELLY or anyone of y'all.

They also never focused on the true friendship of Eddie and David. I think the brothers were kindred soul mates musically and as ""brothers"". In fact, Eddie and David were like big brother (Eddie)-little brother (David). Their friendship lasted until David's untimely death in 1991 and from what I know, the death would cause Eddie to die suddenly the next year. And also, the years are wrong again in the later half:

Eddie and David reunited for a performance in 1985 at Live Aid. In the movie, they reunited...in 1980... at some... bar. Then they decided to form a group called Ruffin-Kendrick. Around 1989, after the band were inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Dennis Edwards teamed up with the two of them to form Ruffin-Kendrick-Edwards. The movie version had them teaming up while the Temptations reunited with Motown, which WAS in 1980. The actual 1989 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction of the Temptations was different from the movie version. In the movie version, Otis is seen hugging Eddie and David. In reality, Eddie, David and Dennis ignored Otis but hugged Melvin. And they actually had speeches I believe.

They made David's death look like a crime scene when he died of an overdose. He was actually carried to the hospital and he addressed himself of who he was before taking one last breath and died. And another miscalculation: MELVIN DIED IN HIS OWN HOME WITH HIS WIFE NEAR HIM! They made it seem like Otis and Mama Rose were there with Melvin at their home when he died while getting baby back ribs. WHAT IS WRONG WITH OTIS, MAN? I swear, man, it was more screwed up than factual. The only reasons to really catch this movie are the following:

1.) The Music
2.) The Performances
3.) The Last Final Great Scene of ""The Classic 5"" performing ""My Girl"" the way it's done

Other than that, if you hate saccharine drama and improper ""facts"", skip this movie, but if you want to know about the musical history of the group and Motown, buy it just on that purpose, please?

It also presents rare old Temptations tunes like ""Mother of Mine"", ""I Want a Love I Can See"" and another song I forgot the name of that Eddie did and of course standards like ""The Way You Do..."", ""My Girl"", ""The Girl's Alright with Me"", ""You're My Everything"", ""Ball of Confusion"", ""Cloud Nine"", ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg"", ""Beauty is Only Skin Deep"", ""Get Ready"" and ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"". And for Eddie fans, snippets of ""Boogie Down"" and ""Keep On Truckin'"".

So if you happen to like anything from the movie, let it be the music and let the Temptations sing on and on as long as we want them to.",1115510400,18,9686,4.391304347826087
1009052,1,6305300887,"The death certificate is somewhat confusing as to whether Earline Ruffin was domiciled in Mississippi or Alabama when she died. However, her complaint indicates that she was a resident of Meridian, Mississippi at the time this case began. See J.A. 87, Ruffin plaintiffs' complaint, p. 4,  11. The district court did not err in determining that Michigan law did not apply to her cause of action, and under Mississippi law, Earline Ruffin's defamation claim was properly dismissed. Assuming Alabama law applies, the result would not change.

D. Intentional infliction of emotional distress

  Under Michigan law, a prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires the following elements: ""(1) extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) intent or recklessness; (3) causation; and (4) severe emotional distress."" Andrews v. Prudential Secs., Inc., 160 F.3d 304, 309 (6th Cir. 1998). Michigan law does not permit recovery when ""mere insults, indignities...or other trivialities"" occur as there ""is no occasion for the law to intervene in every case where some one's feelings are hurt."" Roberts v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 374 N.W.2d 905, 909 (Mich. 1985).

  The district court recognized that plaintiffs' claims under this theory of recovery varied slightly from one another, but that defendants' actions in this case ""were not tortious in any sense, and certainly cannot be reasonably considered outrageous."" J.A. 149, district court's opinion and order of February 3, 2000, p. 19. Assuming that there are inaccuracies in the mini-series as alleged by the plaintiffs, the district court determined that these inaccuracies ""cannot be considered so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency."" Id.

  The Ruffin plaintiffs disagree, stating that the manner in which David Ruffin's death was depicted was so traumatic for them to watch that they later required medical treatment, and the intentional misrepresentation of his death was outrageous and extreme. Furthermore, plaintiffs allege that the portrayal of Earline Ruffin as a prostitute and an unchaste woman is highly offensive to a reasonable person. Hence, they argue that the dismissal of their claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress was erroneous.(5)

  Defendants argue that the mini-series is similar to statements contained in broadcasts and publications which generally do not constitute extreme or outrageous conduct. See Ross v. Burns, 612 F.2d 271, 273-74 (6th Cir. 1980)(finding newspaper's publication of photograph of undercover narcotics officer was not extreme and outrageous); Fry v. Ionia Sentinel-Standard, 300 N.W.2d 687 (Mich. Ct. App. 1980)(finding that an article reporting that the body of plaintiff's husband was removed from a cottage destroyed by fire along with the body of another woman he had been seen with at a local bar was not extreme). They state that the mini-series is similar in nature and therefore not outrageous.(6)

  Defendants also argue that Earline Ruffin failed to allege in her complaint that she suffered emotional distress because of her portrayal as a prostitute and therefore her claim was properly dismissed. Even so, the district court considered Earline Ruffin's claim under this theory and determined that defendants' conduct was neither extreme nor outrageous.

  Plaintiffs' reply brief cites Meyer v. Nottger, 241 N.W.2d 911 (Iowa 1976), a case they claim contains a scenario similar to the manner in which the mini-series misrepresented David Ruffin's death. Meyer held that a mortician's mishandling of a dead body, including misrepresentations to the bereaved family about the details of the body's state of decomposition, was extreme and outrageous.

  We agree with the district court that assuming each of the inaccuracies described in plaintiffs' complaints and submissions is inaccurate in the manner described by plaintiffs, defendants' actions in producing the story written by Otis Williams about the Temptations cannot be considered so extreme in degree as to go beyond all bounds of decency. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on these claims.

VI. CONCLUSION

  Finding the district court did not err in ruling in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' claims of right of publicity, unjust enrichment, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, we AFFIRM. Footnotes

  1 The district court permitted Johnnie Mae Mathews's claims of defamation and false light invasion of privacy to proceed.

  2 Josephine Miles and Rose Franklin each filed separate complaints, while the Ruffins filed a joint complaint.

  3 Earline Ruffin was a minister's wife and school teacher for forty years. She raised David Ruffin but was not his biological mother.

  4 In the district court, the Ruffin plaintiffs argued that the more favorable Michigan law applied because several of Earline Ruffin's prospective heirs were residents of Michigan.

OPINION

_________________

  JOSEPH M. HOOD, District Judge. Plaintiffs appeal the district court's dismissal of their claims in this tort action based on the airing of a mini-series about the Temptations. For the reasons which follow, we AFFIRM.

I. INTRODUCTION

  In November of 1998, National Broadcasting Company (""NBC"") aired a four-hour mini-series depicting the Temptations as recounted in a novel written by Otis Williams, a founding member of the legendary recording group. Plaintiffs in this action include Cheryl Ruffin-Steinback, individually and as representative of the estate of Davis E. Ruffin, lead singer of the group from 1964 to 1968 who was known professionally as David Ruffin; Nedra Ruffin, Kimberly Bogan, and David Ruffin, Jr., the children of Davis Ruffin; Earline Ruffin, the mother of Davis Ruffin; Rose Franklin, the mother of Melvin Franklin, a member of the group; Josephine Miles, the first wife of Otis Williams; and Johnnie Mae Mathews, the first agent of the Temptations.(1)

  Plaintiffs have appealed only their state law tort claims for violation of the right of publicity, unjust enrichment, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Defendants dePasse Entertainment, NBC, David Picker, and Hallmark Entertainment, Inc. Defendants Suzanne dePasse, Otis Williams, Shelly Berger, and Characters Unlimited were never served with the complaint and have been dismissed from this case.

II. ISSUES

  (1) Whether the district court properly dismissed plaintiffs' claims for violation of their rights of publicity or commercial appropriation as a matter of law.

  (2) Whether the district court properly found plaintiffs' claims of unjust enrichment insufficient as a matter of law.

  (3) Whether the district court properly found Earline Ruffin's claim of defamation failed to survive her death as a matter of law.

  (4) Whether the district court properly found the Ruffin plaintiffs' claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress were insufficient as a matter of law.

III. BACKGROUND

  The mini-series at issue in this case relates the story of the Temptations from the group's beginning until the present and is based on a novel written by Otis Williams. It details portions of the lives of its members, their families, and those having business relationships with the Temptations. Only Williams was compensated for the mini-series, and the plaintiffs allege that any use of their likenesses through actor portrayals was without their permission. The airing was so successful that video cassettes of the mini-series were available for purchase or rental.

  Plaintiffs filed three complaints in Michigan state court, and the action was removed by defendants to federal court.(2) The Ruffins' complaint objected to the depiction of David Ruffin's final moments in the mini-series in which his beaten body was thrown from a moving car in front of a hospital where he dies. According to the mini-series, his body remained unclaimed in a morgue for a week after his death. Plaintiffs state that he was taken to the hospital by a limousine and was escorted to the waiting area by his driver who informed the attendants of his identity. The Ruffin children further state that his body was claimed by one of them within a few days after his death. The children also object to the portrayal of David Ruffin in the mini-series as single and childless while all the other members of the Temptations were shown with wives and children. Earline Ruffin alleges she was falsely portrayed as a prostitute because David Ruffin's character indicated that he was given to a pimp by his mother to settle a debt.(3)

  Rose Franklin disputes the manner in which the mini-series depicted the final days of her son, Melvin. She states that rather than being confined to a wheelchair and dying in her home, her son died in his sleep at his home in California.

  Josephine Miles disagrees with the way the mini-series portrayed her ex-husband Otis Williams as a better father and husband than he was. She feels this gives her less credit for the raising of their son. She also objects to the implication that she was involved with another man during her marriage to Williams.

  Defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaints pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) which were followed by several hearings wherein the parties submitted documentary evidence in support of their positions. The district court considered this evidentiary material in ruling on some of plaintiffs claims, resulting in dismissal of their claims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), the summary judgment standard.

IV. STANDARDS OF REVIEW

  This court reviews de novo a district court's dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). See Varljen v. Cleveland Gear Co., Inc., 250 F.3d 426, 429 (6th Cir. 2001). The court must ""consider as true the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint and construe[] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[s]."" Id.

  A grant of summary judgment by the district court is also reviewed de novo, Brody v. City of Mason, 250 F.3d 432, 436-37 (6th Cir. 2001), with all evidence viewed ""in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment[,]"" White's Landing Fisheries, Inc. v. Buchholzer, 29 F.3d 229, 231 (6th Cir. 1994). Summary judgment is appropriate only where there are ""no issues of material fact present and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Id. at 231.

V. DISCUSSION

  Because this is a diversity action removed from Michigan state court, the district court applied Michigan law to all of plaintiffs' claims except for the defamation claim asserted by Earline Ruffin.

A. Right of publicity

  The right of publicity is defined as ""an appropriation of one's name or likeness for the defendant's advantage."" Carson v. Here's Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc., 698 F.2d 831, 834 (6th Cir. 1983). The purpose of this right is ""to protect the commercial interest of celebrities in their identities[,]"", id. at 835, as ""[t]he famous have an exclusive legal right during life to control and profit from the commercial use of their name and personality[,]"" id. (quoting Memphis Dev. Found. v. Factors Etc., Inc., 616 F.2d 956, 957 (6th Cir. 1980)).

  The district court rejected plaintiffs' claims of violation of their rights of publicity on the basis that depicting one's life-story without his or her permission did not constitute a violation of the right of publicity under Michigan law. See J.A. 141, district court's opinion and order of February 3, 2000, p. 11. At the time of this ruling, the Michigan Supreme Court had not addressed this tort, and the lower Michigan courts had only noted that it was among the types of ""invasion of privacy"" rights recognized under Michigan law. In drawing this conclusion, the district court relied in part on the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition which noted in  47 that use of identity ""for the purposes of trade does not ordinarily include the use of a person's identity in news reporting, commentary, entertainment, works of fiction or nonfiction, or in advertising that is incidental to such uses.""

  The district court also focused on Matthews v. Wozencraft, 15 F.3d 432 (5th Cir. 1994), in which an ex-husband alleged misappropriation of his name and likeness by his ex-wife and a movie studio when events of his life as a police officer, some of which were fictionalized, were sold as movie rights. His claim for violation of his right of publicity was denied by the Fifth Circuit which held that the term ""'likeness' does not include general incidents from a person's life, especially when fictionalized. The narrative of an individual's life, standing alone, lacks the value of a name or likeness that the misappropriation tort projects."" Id. at 438. A similar claim brought by a former Black Panther against the producers of a film depicting a fictionalized account of his life story was rejected in Seale v. Gramercy Pictures, 949 F.Supp. 331 (E.D. Pa. 1996).

  Plaintiffs argue that the district court misinterprets their position and has reduced their claims to the narrow notion that the defendants only depicted their life stories without their consent. They allege that their life stories were not told in the mini-series, but instead their identities were used as colorful props to make Otis Williams's life story more entertaining and appealing. Plaintiffs state that this court's holding in Carson v. Here's Johnny Portable Toilets, Inc. provides them with relief, and that the district court erred by dismissing their claims for failure to state a cause of action.

  Defendants assert that the First Amendment defeats plaintiffs' right of publicity claims because the mini-series is a movie concerning a musical group where there is public interest, and is not a commercial advertisement for the sale of goods. Defendants argue that the First Amendment bars claims for right of publicity where the publication is a matter of public interest, and that it has long been settled that ""motion pictures are a form of expression protected by the First Amendment."" Rogers v. Grimaldi, 695 F.Supp. 112, 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).

  Defendants note that both the Restatement (Third) and Carson focus on identity appropriation for commercial purposes, which is distinguished from a public interest publication. See Pallas v. Crowley, Milner & Co., 33 N.W.2d 911, 917 (Mich. 1948)(recognizing ""a fundamental difference between the use of a person's photographic likeness"" for a newsworthy purpose and a commercial use such as an advertisement). Therefore, defendants state that consent or permission from plaintiffs was not required, and plaintiffs have cited no legal authority to support their claims.

  There is relatively no case law cited by plaintiffs to support their claims, and their argument under this tort is very weak. The majority of cases which discuss the right of publicity, including Carson from this circuit, focus on the pecuniary interest in one's identity. We conclude that the use of plaintiffs' fictionalized likenesses in a work protected by the First Amendment and the advertizing incidental to such uses did not give rise to a claim for relief under the plaintiffs' rights of publicity for the reasons stated by the district court.

B. Unjust enrichment

  Based on the averments in the complaints, the district court found plaintiffs' claims of unjust enrichment to be duplicative or derivative of their right of publicity claims and dismissed them, referencing the reasons given for dismissal of the right of publicity claims. Plaintiffs decline to offer a distinction between the claims and instead refer to their arguments supporting their right of publicity claims as to why the district court erred in granting defendants' motions to dismiss.

  A review of the complaints in this case indicates that the allegations under the right of publicity claims and the unjust enrichment claims are duplicative. The Ruffin plaintiffs' complaint even uses the phrase ""enrich themselves unjustifiably"" in discussing their right of publicity claims. J.A. 94, Ruffins' complaint, p. 11,  54. Finding no error in the district court's resolution of the plaintiffs' right of publicity claims, we likewise find no error in the district court's treatment of the plaintiffs' claims of unjust enrichment.

C. Defamation

  Only Plaintiff Earline Ruffin appeals the dismissal of her claim of defamation. This claim is based on the remark by the actor portraying her son that he was given to a pimp because his mother owed the pimp money. Noting that the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws  150 cmt. e (1971) suggests that ""in the case of multistate publication of defamatory material, plaintiff's domicile will ordinarily be the state with the greatest interest in having its law applied[,]"" the district court determined that the law of Mississippi, where Earline Ruffin was domiciled, was applicable to her claim. See J.A. 147, district court's opinion and order of February 3, 2000, p. 17. Mississippi law, as outlined in Catchings v. Hartman, 174 So. 553 (Miss. 1937), does not permit this type of cause of action to survive a plaintiff's death even if the case was filed prior to the death of the plaintiff. Because Earline Ruffin passed away on August 15, 1999, the district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss her claim of defamation.

  The Ruffin plaintiffs argue that Earline Ruffin's death certificate indicates she died in Alabama, and that she was a former resident of Mississippi. See J.A. 427, Earline Ruffin's death certificate. Therefore, it is asserted that Alabama law is applicable to her case.(4)

  Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., Inc. 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941), holds that in diversity cases, the choice of law rules applied by the federal court must conform to those of the state in which it sits. Michigan's choice of law rule, as noted by defendants, provides that there is a presumption that Michigan law applies to a case unless there is a rational reason to displace it. See Sutherland v. Kennington Truck Serv., Ltd., 562 N.W.2d 466, 471 (Mich. 1997). If a foreign state has an interest in having its law applied, a determination is made whether Michigan's interests require that Michigan law be applied. See id. Defendants argue that Michigan has neither contacts nor an interest in having its law applied because the mini-series was a nationwide broadcast. Thus, they assert that the only state with an interest in this claim is that of Mississippi, Earline Ruffin's domicile.

  Moreover, defendants argue that even if Alabama law applied, rather than that of Mississippi, the defamation claim was properly dismissed. Specifically, they point to Ala. Code  6-5-462 which provides that injuries to one's reputation do not survive a deceased plaintiff. See also Fitch v. Voit, 624 So. 2d 542, 543-44 (Ala. 1993).

  The death certificate is somewhat confusing as to whether Earline Ruffin was domiciled in Mississippi or Alabama when she died. However, her complaint indicates that she was a resident of Meridian, Mississippi at the time this case began. See J.A. 87, Ruffin plaintiffs' complaint, p. 4,  11. The district court did not err in determining that Michigan law did not apply to her cause of action, and under Mississippi law, Earline Ruffin's defamation claim was properly dismissed. Assuming Alabama law applies, the result would not change.

D. Intentional infliction of emotional distress

  Under Michigan law, a prima facie case for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires the following elements: ""(1) extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) intent or recklessness; (3) causation; and (4) severe emotional distress."" Andrews v. Prudential Secs., Inc., 160 F.3d 304, 309 (6th Cir. 1998). Michigan law does not permit recovery when ""mere insults, indignities...or other trivialities"" occur as there ""is no occasion for the law to intervene in every case where some one's feelings are hurt."" Roberts v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 374 N.W.2d 905, 909 (Mich. 1985).

  The district court recognized that plaintiffs' claims under this theory of recovery varied slightly from one another, but that defendants' actions in this case ""were not tortious in any sense, and certainly cannot be reasonably considered outrageous."" J.A. 149, district court's opinion and order of February 3, 2000, p. 19. Assuming that there are inaccuracies in the mini-series as alleged by the plaintiffs, the district court determined that these inaccuracies ""cannot be considered so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency."" Id.

  The Ruffin plaintiffs disagree, stating that the manner in which David Ruffin's death was depicted was so traumatic for them to watch that they later required medical treatment, and the intentional misrepresentation of his death was outrageous and extreme. Furthermore, plaintiffs allege that the portrayal of Earline Ruffin as a prostitute and an unchaste woman is highly offensive to a reasonable person. Hence, they argue that the dismissal of their claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress was erroneous.(5)

  Defendants argue that the mini-series is similar to statements contained in broadcasts and publications which generally do not constitute extreme or outrageous conduct. See Ross v. Burns, 612 F.2d 271, 273-74 (6th Cir. 1980)(finding newspaper's publication of photograph of undercover narcotics officer was not extreme and outrageous); Fry v. Ionia Sentinel-Standard, 300 N.W.2d 687 (Mich. Ct. App. 1980)(finding that an article reporting that the body of plaintiff's husband was removed from a cottage destroyed by fire along with the body of another woman he had been seen with at a local bar was not extreme). They state that the mini-series is similar in nature and therefore not outrageous.(6)

  Defendants also argue that Earline Ruffin failed to allege in her complaint that she suffered emotional distress because of her portrayal as a prostitute and therefore her claim was properly dismissed. Even so, the district court considered Earline Ruffin's claim under this theory and determined that defendants' conduct was neither extreme nor outrageous.

  Plaintiffs' reply brief cites Meyer v. Nottger, 241 N.W.2d 911 (Iowa 1976), a case they claim contains a scenario similar to the manner in which the mini-series misrepresented David Ruffin's death. Meyer held that a mortician's mishandling of a dead body, including misrepresentations to the bereaved family about the details of the body's state of decomposition, was extreme and outrageous.

  We agree with the district court that assuming each of the inaccuracies described in plaintiffs' complaints and submissions is inaccurate in the manner described by plaintiffs, defendants' actions in producing the story written by Otis Williams about the Temptations cannot be considered so extreme in degree as to go beyond all bounds of decency. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment on these claims.

VI. CONCLUSION

  Finding the district court did not err in ruling in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' claims of right of publicity, unjust enrichment, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, we AFFIRM. Footnotes

  *The Honorable Joseph M. Hood, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.

  1 The district court permitted Johnnie Mae Mathews's claims of defamation and false light invasion of privacy to proceed.

  2 Josephine Miles and Rose Franklin each filed separate complaints, while the Ruffins filed a joint complaint.

  3 Earline Ruffin was a minister's wife and school teacher for forty years. She raised David Ruffin but was not his biological mother.

  4 In the district court, the Ruffin plaintiffs argued that the more favorable Michigan law applied because several of Earline Ruffin's prospective heirs were residents of Michigan. The district court held that ""[s]uch an interest is too remote to outweigh Mississippi's traditional interest in having its law applied to defamation regarding its residents."" J.A. 147, district court's opinion and order of February 3, 2000, p. 19. This argument is not revived on appeal.

  5 Neither Josephine Miles nor Rose Franklin appealed the grant of summary judgment on their claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress.

  6 The ""newsworthy"" cases cited by defendants are distinguishable from plaintiffs' circumstances because of the falsity alleged in the mini-series.",1113264000,17,20969,5.356968215158925
1009054,5,6305300887,"I am 26 years old, I didn't grow up in the 60's or early 70's when the Temptations were extremely popular.  Honestly, before this movie, I thought the Temptations were a group for generations past, and was only familiar with very few of their songs, I first saw this movie about a year ago on VH1, and I fell in love with it.  I immediatly looked in stores to see if I could find it on DVD, and I eventually found it, and After buying it, I was hooked. I must have watched it everyday for a month. I was so consumed with the story, the music,...This is a truly wonderful movie, I have become a huge fan of the Temptations, I've researched about the group and the members individually, I can't get enough info about these truly talented men. By the time you get towards the end of the movie, you feel like you are in the story yourself, it draws you in and makes you feel like you actually know these characters, and that they are a part of you and you feel the hurt and anguish when, for instance, Otis Williams loses his son, and when the various members of the group pass away, When you see Paul Williams, the once vibrant, idealist who was responsible for incorporating movement and choreography into the group's routine early on, became consumed by alchohol addiction and eventually leads to his suicide.  You feel the emotions of of all the characters.  The actors portraying the Temptations in the movie are exceptional!  The True treasure of this film is Terron Brooks,-""Eddie Kendricks"". See this movie! you won't regret it!",1109030400,2,1532,4.516245487364621
1009055,5,6305300887,"I watched this movie for the second time...just tonight. I really enjoy this movie. It has such great casting...the Temptations characters come alive....and I cried when I watched several of the Temptations pass on....I often wondered over the years what happened to the original men in the group. The music is great, full songs, not just partial ones. I always loved this group...and I felt like I was being transported back to the 60's when I grew up!! Music doesn't get any better than this!! Their music transcends race, and age. They truly did tell their stories and display their true souls when they sang. If you are or were a fan of these great singers and/or the Motown sound, you owe it to yourself to watch this movie!!",1103673600,,730,4.666666666666667
1009056,5,6305300887,"The Temptations is one of the best movies ever made.  The film is on my personal Top Ten List.  Based on the memoirs of founding member Otis Williams, it tells the story of how the Temptations came to be.  The whole undertaking is done with such love, dedication, and devotion, that you cannot help but be swept away in this story of the rise to fame and fortune of a group of dreaming black kids from Detroit.

You get to see what it was really like behind the scenes of Motown, how Berry Gordy ran his breakthrough, genius, music revolution at Hitsville, U.S.A.  You see that some things have changed about the music industry, and some things remain the same.  For example, today record labels will dump someone after one failing album.  Gordy supported the Tempations for two years before they had a hit.  He had faith in them, faith that you just no longer see today in a music industry based on profits and greed.  And something that remains the same is that there are still unscrupulous promoters out there who will take advantage of a young and naiive group.  Also, touring on the road is still a big strain on marriages of the performers.  The  movie has as much heartbreak in it as it does joy.

Everything about The Temptations is sublime.  The singing will make you get up and dance.  Every song is performed in its entirety.  The times are portrayed so well, from the segregated 50's all the way up to the 1990's.  Everything is changed to match each passing decade: the hair, the clothes, the lighting, the music, even the filmography.  Featuring the real Smokey Robinson as himself, this film is not to be missed by anyone who loves the Motown classics.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will get this incredible buzz - and you will never look at the Tempations the same way again.",1101600000,2,1796,4.521739130434782

Terron Brooks (the actor that played Eddie) and Christian Payton (the actor that played Paul) actually did their own singing (the only song that terron didn't really sing was Paradise). That is amazing.

This is a movie that the whole family can watch. You must see this movie",1099699200,,478,4.666666666666667

1009059,5,6305300887,"This is one of the greatest movies of all times!  The characters come alive.  As I watch it, I have to remind myself that the characters on the television are not the real Temptations.  It is spooky, but I get a selfish satisfaction knowing that I can experience the beauty and the sadness of the Temptations whenever I choose.  My ten-year-old is even hooked on it.  We watch it at least once a week and he swears that he sings like Eddie and Paul!  In fact, he does.  Go figure!  It gives me comfort to know that the genius of The Temptations has been integrated into another, younger generation.
What makes this movie so wonderful is that it takes us back to the times when music really meant something and touched us on a deeper level. Each time that I watch it I am transported to a time when the melody of a voice could melt away the pains of a troubled society.  Don't get me wrong, there were problems with segregation and wars, but there was an innocence that I long to return to.  I hope that Paul, David, Eddie, and Melvin are resting in peace.  Their music changed the face of entertainment and now their stories have truly changed my perception of the world.
I say all of this to say that this movie is a must have  for Temptations fans as well as for those who want a break from all of the ugliness in the world.",1086825600,2,1326,4.26

1009123,5,6305300887,"I don't know where to begin. This movie is so unbelievably awesome on so many levels.  I rank it up there with Titanic and Pretty Woman, no, you know what - this movie is better. The cast is superb, not only acting but dancing AND SINGING. Props should be given to the actors who re-recorded basically ALL of the songs in THEIR OWN voices, especially Terron Brooks and Christian Payton - this fact seems to be overlooked often or not known.
Along with the great performances from all of the characters, especially Leon, Christian, Terron, Charles and DB, the film-making was top notch.
Scenes so unforgettable that point out the skill of film-making is of course the wonderful part where the Tempts are in B/W on TV performing 'My Girl' and then they fade into color. This is so genius and gets me every time.
Also the scene where they kick David out of the band and the four of them are facing the window. Then Paul turns the other way, and you can see the camera in slow motion pausing for effect as if to say, 'Paul, you are next'. Pure genius.
And of course my favorite part of all, the nostalgic end, where after all of the original Tempts have now died except Otis, it is haunting how they are seemingly 'resurrected', shown in all of their purple glory. They are performing 'My Girl' as if from heaven along with sad narration from Otis. After their exquisitely choreographed TO-THE-NINES performance, they bow, and Otis saying, ""Temptations (pause -voice breaks) Forever"" makes me tear up every time. That is so awesome. This is what filmmaking should be about.
I know that there are people complaining about the accuracy of the film and I understand their gripes, but all films based on real life usually change stuff up for 'dramatic effect'. In this case, it works extremely well and is probably the factor that makes this movie a TOTAL CLASSIC.",1082419200,2,1856,4.624242424242424
1009124,5,6305300887,"I must admit, I was just a kid when the Tempts hit their stride, but became a fan in later years, and a fanatic after I saw the movie last year(2003). I think I have watched it to the point where I could play a few roles myself, and I have showed the movie to friends as well, and will NOT let anyone borrow it. This is a warm, feel-good movie that brings forth heartfelt joy, as well as the ability to draw tears, as at Melvin's funeral. It also draws multiple watchers of the movie into strong unity and solidarity. One of the positive features of the movie is its ability to show how drugs and alcohol can not only ruin unity but friendships and careers as well. It is a powerful movie to show to addicts, who can see for themselves the depths that are brought on by these two curses to humanity. The music is, of course, fantastic and nostalgic. The acting is superb, and choreography the bomb. It is basically ""safe"" to show anyone, as it is not overwhelmed by cursing and vulgarity, and there is no nudity in the film. I recommend this movie to everybody. It's a true joy.",1082073600,,1078,4.263414634146342
1009125,3,6305300887,"After watching the VH1 movie and the DVD, the VHS leaves out some important aspects of this wonderful documentry.  Not that it's not something everyone should have in their collection, but if important scenes are taken out, like when David Ruffin is telling the other Tempatations about his home life and feeling being apart of the group is the first thing he's ever been apart of in his life while sitting at the kitchen table, or going back to the south for the first time after segregation and seeing the ropes down that separated the blacks from the whites and how it made them all feel being from the south to witness this event, it looses a lot in the translation of the essence of partnership.  The VHS should be in Full length as seen in the VH1 Movie and the DVD.  I find that is the only draw back of it.

I now live in Europe, but when I hear them I almost get goose-bumps, I get in the best mood, a definite natural high. I share a love of this group with people everywhere, starting from my grandmother and going down. The movie supposedly tells their story, with a few alterations that is. It shows how success messed up some of their lives and how for others although, it made them very happy, there were still some more important elements missing in their lives. It's a good, long story with lots of music and drama. I only wish they had gone on making music together for a longer time and with less problems of all sorts. They were so good and blended in so well together. They'll always be a soul legend.",1075161600,,819,4.359477124183006

1009130,5,6305300887,"I wasn't able to watch the movie when it aired on NBC.  But I purchased the DVD a year ago and fell in love with the movie.  Watching actor Leon portrayed David Ruffin's character was wonderful and somewhat spooky.  He played that role to a tee.  Leon sounded like David, had the same mannerism as David that it was so amazing.
I was proud at the performances by all the actors in the movie.  Even though she had a small part, I was proud of Rhonda Ross Kendrick who is Diana Ross' and Berry Gordy's daughter who played Maxine, Paul's wife, I was proud of her performance as well.
Sure there were inconsistencies in the movie.  Yes, the producers of the movies should have let the audience, particularly the younger audiences know what happened to the lives of these wonderful, yet troubled men who made up the Tempting Temptations.
(...)want to know about all that, read Otis' book or do research for yourself.  But other than that, the movie was excellent in my book.  The choreography in this movie was OUTSTANDING.  The music was fantastic and the costumes was fabulous.
I would recommend this movie wholeheartedly.  Yes, in some ways this movie is factual as well as fictional, but it is still worth watching and it will make you go out and read the book and do your own research about this fantastic group who will always be the number one in my book.",1066348800,12,1357,4.524590163934426

If you want to see The Temptations in concert, get the music DVD. This is neither a documentary nor a musical--it dramatizes The Temptations' struggle to succeed, to deal with the pitfalls of fame, and invites us to celebrate their triumphs and strengths with them. It shows the consequences of destructive behavior (good for children) and is suitable for the entire family, yet is not a kids' movie. Excellent acting, directing, photography. Absorbing, tragic, heart-warming, unforgettable. If you didn't love The Temptations before, you will after seeing this.",1059004800,4,722,5.342105263157895

I especially watched for the ""entire"" song to be performed and this movie did that superbly.  Choreography was great, would have liked more.  The actors were superb and  the ""David Ruffin"" character performed with amusement, great skill and charisma.  I hadn't known Ruffin was such a challenge to the rest of the group.

Part of the success of the Temptations is the ""Funk Brothers"" - the historic group of great musicians who performed so much of that fabulous 60s Motown music.  See that wonderfully entertaining movie ""Standing Behind the Shadows of Motown"" and, there is a CD out too.  Motown!!  There will never be another!  Motown is an American culture!......Rizz",1056326400,3,863,5.007042253521127
1009198,4,6305300887,"Let me just say that I love the Temptin' Temptations.  I am 19 years old, but my parents are old enough to remember the good old days...so they were my exposure.  The Tempts I would have loved to see are no longer here (RIP Eddie J. Kendrick, Paul Williams, and David Ruffin).  So I have relied on videos, books, etc.

This movie is a good place to start.  The music is great, for one.  Kudos to Terron Brooks, Christian Payton, for not only their portrayals of Eddie and Paul, but for being able to sing their own parts!! Excellent!!  And what can I say about Leon?  He really put on a show as Ruff!!!  KUDOS!!

My only gripes w/this film were the inaccuracies.  I know for brevity's sake, you can't include all.  But, the way I see it, if you can find the time to make something up, surely you can find the time to include truth.  The scene where Al got put out of the group:  history remembers that scene happening differently.  I feel the movie should not have switched it.  If you research after watching the film, you will see that the situation would have ended the same way in history that they made it happen in the movie.  Al would have still hit Paul w/the bottle and would have been thrown out of the group.  It made Al seem lazy ( I don't know, maybe he was).  But on that particular day, it was Paul.  I also have to wonder why Otis' vices were not as known in the movie as others.  We saw Al drunk once, Paul's alcoholism and ""suicide"", David's drug problem, they didn't do Eddie right at all, but all we saw of Otis' was him getting off of the bus w/the Flo Ballard character.  He and Josephine never flat out had a discussion about it.  His vice was women, so why weren't we privy to that?  You would have thought he was the Pope after watching the movie.

I'm starting to realize that I like it more for the music than anything else. Of course, when I saw it the first time, I felt it was biased, but after some research, watching videos, reading, listening, etc., I am becoming more and more perturbed by it. I know you're not supposed to take everything w/a grain of salt, but come on! Geez!!

A few things that angered me was(1)The scene at Ruff's apt: let's be real. Maybe DR had developed a bit of an ego trip, but let's not make it seem so completely unreasonable to why he would wonder why the group's name wouldn't change. I'm NOT saying I agreed with him, but can you really fault him for wondering or for assuming? A certain diva's group got a name change, Smokey and the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, etc. I just don't feel like something like this would make him the Devil Incarnate or a problem needing to be rectified. Or at least not the way it was portrayed. (2)Maybe it's just me, but when ppl subtlely(sp?) make themselves look like Patron Saints, I tend to think they're not. Otis being the one to talk to Gordy, or telling ppl to vote David out, blah, blah, blah...sorry, but I don't buy it. Otis, the one DESTINED to hold it together.  Please.  Seems to me, he was the only one (w/Melvin in tow) who seemed to want to kiss the rear of Berry. (3)The scene where Ruff comes onstage: now, according to Dennis, Ruff knew he would be the replacement and encouraged him to do it (which also leads me to believe that his dismissal was so overdramatic). Anyway, back to my point, Dennis and David were cool, so I highly doubt that Dennis would have called him an ""M-Fer."" I mean,really, if I caught it, then editing should have caught it. (4)What the HEEZY was up w/the interpretations of the different guys? Who was in charge of telling them how to act? What I mean is, why do they make the fellas seem so wimpy and passive? Mel, throughout the whole movie, seems like either a mama's boy or Otis' right hip. Was he really like that? He just didn't seem to stand on his own. I didn't like that. Same w/Eddie J. Now, many people will tell you that while he was a gentleman and all, he would tell you what he thought. He didn't believe in kissing ***. I'm not saying show Eddie telling all these people where to go, but they didn't have to make him so passive. (5)Now, I know Suzanne DePasse was over this movie, but couldn't she have added a certain realism to the movie and showed what a cutthroat Gordy was? The way they showed BG was too nice and too fake. (6)Now O, were you really there when Ruffin died? I absolutely HATE IT when people interpret what the last days of someone was like. Especially when they probably weren't on the best of terms. It was Dennis and Eddie who were concerned about where Ruffin was and who he was very close to those last years. I could have done w/o him being thrown out of the car. I read somwhere back in '98 that Ruffin's family contested the production of the movie due to the nature of the portrayal. (7)How does the movie manage to fit Paul's death into a seven-minute plus song, David's demise into a series of scenes, Mel's death into a last touching scene w/his mom and best friend...and Eddie's into TWO FREAKIN' SENTENCES??!!! That is so low. Unbelievable even. I just have to ask why? Now some say that b/c Otis probably didn't have much say over the script, but if allegedly, there was forgiveness on both parts at the end of Ed's life, wouldn't it have been good for O to fight for there to be more on Eddie's passing? Two sentences does not cut it. As a matter of fact, if you blink or sneeze, be assured that you WILL miss it.

Mama Rose: ""What was it that got Eddie?""  The worst and most inconcievable line in any movie I've seen in a while.  Awful.  It makes me wonder if fences were really mended btwn EJK and O like he says in his updated chapter.

What it boils down to is my thinking that if they were using O's book, he would have more say, or at least fight for more, in what came across the screen. I would have liked to have seen more good times btwn the guys...more scenes like the New Year's dinner scene. Show us how they bonded outside of the music. The Motown cookout doesn't count. These guys didn't get so close just talking about music and riding on tour buses, etc.

I just feel like more positivity or more truth, could have been injected in the scenes. I mean, are ratings really EVERYTHING?

But it is good for the music and things like that.  It's fun seeing and figuring out who the other actors are supposed to be.  They did, however, accurately make the Martha Reeves character a secretary.

Oh, btw, I really don't recommend the VHS version UNLESS you order it from NBC.  The video cuts out enough scenes to make you mad.  Spring for the DVD.  You'll thank yourself.",1055980800,13,6584,4.316003249390739

This movie was a wonderful story of the ""ups"" and ""downs"" of a popular music group from beginning to end.  I have seen it twice now and have purchased the DVD and will probably watch it again a few more times.  It really made me a true fan of the Temptations and of Motown.  David Ruffin was just so talented and his voice just seemed to be a perfect fit for the harmonies provided by the group.  It made me sad to see him struggle with drugs.  Melvin's arthritis, Paul's suicide and Eddie's Cancer were real heartbreakers.  Otis tried to keep it all together through thick and thin.  A group that had so much talent and energy and they all had to leave us except Otis.  Again, the songs and performances were fabulous.

I am now collecting CDs of their music--The young actors who portray the original tempts were excellent!! They played their parts of the different personalities quite well--I especially liked the actor that played the role of David Ruffin [Leon]--I also read some of the reviews and one of the reviews mentioned that because Otis Williams was telling the story from his point of view, it made him out to be the better man of the group--I saw Otis more in control, but not necessarily the better man--He had flaws as well, and it showed in the movie--For example, the scene where they were coming back from one of the Motor Revues, as Otis was getting off the bus, he was holding hands with one of the other female performers, and his wife caught that brief affection and that was actually the beginning of the end of their marriage--I read the book, and it did cover more than the movie--Even though the movie was good, I only gave it ""4"" stars because they cut about 30 minutes from the TV version, which was REAL DUMB of the producers, or whoever decided to do this--Some of the scenes that were cut, like the picnic scene and the part where otis goes to visit paul at his home , and paul is begging to get back in the group, but we see that the alcohol has taken its toll on his cordination and movements, he couldn't even stand up straight!!

I was in and out of the room, so I missed a great deal of it. One day when it aired on VH1, I finally sat down and watched it, and man was I mad that I had missed out on a phenomenal movie!! After that day, I've been hooked. I watch this movies faithfully once a week, and I have gotten my 9 year old niece hooked too. Whenever she comes to visit, we watch it at LEAST 3 or 4 times. And once you get hooked on the movie, you get hooked on the music as well. Between the two of us, we have at LEAST 15 Temptations cds. And not the new stuff, I'm talking about the original. Anything after the departure of Eddie Kendrcks and Paul Williams we don't listen to. The only thing that I did not like about this movie was how it was only told from one Tempts point of view, but of course that cannot be helped, so I can live with that. Not to sound fanatical, but I have fallen in love with the movie, and the actors portrayal of the Tempting 5. This was truly an allstar cast. I fell in love with Christian's soulful voice,dancing and smooth good looks, Terron's beautiful falsetto and boyish charm,Leon's brashness, badboy attitude, and fabulous voice,and D.B.'s engaging smile, booming bass, and beddroom eyes.

I finally caught it on VH1 this past holiday season, once more this past Febuary and plan on watching it again when it airs again this coming Sunday. While the movie is told from Otis Williams' perpective it has moments that deals with his struggle to keep the group together, the group's frustation with Motown and producer Norman Whitfield, David Ruffin's inflated ego and cocaine addiction, Paul Williams' frustration, alcoholism and depression over taking a back seat to Ruffin and his eventual suicide, Melvin Franklin's battle with arthritis and Eddie Kendricks' frustation with the direction of the group after Ruffin and Paul Williams' depature. The actors who portrayed the five original members were great especially Leon who looked and sounded like David Ruffin. And they can actual sing too. And although some music performance were lip-synched they more than held their own when they did their own singing. A must-see for any Temptations fan and a great introduction to anyone who is not familar with a group who paved the way for groups that followed like The Dramatic, The Stylistics, Harold Melvin and The Blue Notes, etc. I heard that Motown's next TV movie project will be a boipic on Marvin Gaye.

There were some things in the miniseries that made me want to know more about the Temptations, so I got an updated (2002) copy of Otis Williams's book to fill in some of the gaps in the history of the Temptations (keeping in mind, of course, that this was Otis's version of the Temps history...)
I was amazed at the number of discrepancies between the miniseries and Otis's book (Remember, the miniseries is ""based"" on the book.) Some of them are relatively minor and harmless, and a certain number are to be expected in order to increase a production's appeal (and to be able to squeeze the 40 year history of the Temps into a 2 1/2 hour movie!)  But there are a LOT of major discrepancies/inaccuracies.  The bottom line is, don't accept everything you see in the miniseries as the gospel truth about the Temps.  .....
Despite the discrepancies, I highly recommend both the miniseries AND the book... And remember, I'm not claiming Otis's version is accurate.  I'm just comparing the miniseries to the information in his book, which was supposedly the basis of the movie....",1049932800,3,1345,4.677966101694915

It's a gripping, emotional movie that captures the idealism of youth and the trials of fame.  The character development is incredible and the acting is superb to the point where you think you're actually watching the Temptations themselves.  The film-making is crisp: you'll see Paul favoring milk over alcohol on a tour bus with the whole Motown crew; it's a passing scene that lasts a second or two and it represents the innocence of the band members which didn't last long.

The Temptations were one of Motowns hottest and most versatile acts with their carefully planned chorography on stage and their diverse ranmge of shimmering harmonies on record. An interesting aspect of the series early sequences are when they are first introduced to Motown Records and its fun to see portrayals of the great Motown legends such as  Diana Ross, Martha Reeves, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson. Interestingly enough Diana Ross' daughter, Rhonda Ross makes an apperance in the film playing the troubled Paul Williams wife. The sequences where the group are seen performing Papa Was A Rolling Stone and Paul Williams is about to shoot himself are moving and the funeral is sure to get a lump in your throat (where Smokey Robinson himself appears). The film also carefully chronicles David Ruffins fall from grace as he steadily declined into cocaine addiction andalso continually mentally and physically tortued his wife, Tammi Terrell.

Ricky Fante is listed in the credits as ""Marvin Gaye"" but I have not found any scene with him in it.  So, that makes me think there was more filmed but it was cut in the TV and video. I would have liked to see the uncut version. We still love the film and look at it from time to time.",1033776000,,1022,4.1421319796954315

Leon made David Ruffin come to life. Every song just made you sing along. Each actor big or small really put their all into their characters. I could watch this movie over and over until the tape pop or the vcr burn out. I loved the five heart beats but that movie is saying ""I can't get next to you"" when it comes to The Temptations movie. ONE LOVE",1033344000,2,499,4.2631578947368425

Any one else who watched it with me,became a fanatic as well. Like any biography,some things were changed for dramatic purposes(like Paul Williams really dying in August of '73,not in '72),but it was enjoyable & finally gives props to Paul Williams,a fantastic singer whose diminished role in the group was tragic,& of course,David Ruffin,the [sass] & vinegar of the infamously SMOOTH Temps. I condem the Emmys for overlooking Leon & Christian Payton. My biggest grips are the fact that since Otis Williams is the only surviving member of the ""CLASSIC FIVE""its from his perspective and much of it tends to shift into his personal life. I held off buying the video version due to the fact that the running time was much shorter than the TV version when I caved in & bought it ,I noticed many of the best parts were edited out(a portion of the groups first rehersal,at the table when David joins the group,the Motown picnic incident,and last but not least,David & Eddies duet of ""You're My Everything""),in favor of Otis's family scenes. Fortunately, the DVD version is the movie in it's entirety. In all,one star is docked on the video version.

1009292,5,6305300887,"I did not purchase the video; I taped both parts when it aired in 1998.  This was a very powerful portrayal of one of the greatest male R & B groups in music history.  I had no idea what these guys went through during a period of obscurity.  It was one point when we did not here any decent recordings from them.  Then out of the woodwork comes'Treat Her Like A Lady'.  I may have been 17 at the time, but this song had me on my feet the very first time I heard it.  When the DJ said at the end of the song that it was the Temptations, I could not believe it.  My aunt went out and got the 45...WOW
Getting back to the movie, I was in amazement of the choreography.  When they were singing ""The Way You Do The Things You Do"", my mind flashed back to a footage video of theirs when they may have been on the Ed Sullivan Show.  The choereography was so tight that I jumped to my feet and said to my husband ""Rewind it"".  I realized we couldn't because we were watching it on television and I was taping it... But I was amazed.  I was not aware that Paul Williams committed suicide, but I do remember the passings of David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, and Melvin Franklin...I had no idea how close Melvin and Otis were...Maybe that's why he has not replaced him...what a friend and brother...

I was first hesistant, but OH MY GOODNESS, I didn't want the movie to ever end.  Now, I am truly a fan of the Temptations.  I loved watching how determination and strength got them what they really wanted.  It was a movie that could teach anyone to never give-up.  I found it awesome the way the movie had several great actors to play the part.  They all went well together.  I really liked Eddie (wasn't he just sooo cute and sweet), Otis was great for his wisdom and strength, and Paul was too ""cool"".  This is a movie that you have to see even if you don't like motown music or the other oldies.  I never got into that music too much, but this movie just blew me away!

Makes you want to go back to that time and place.  This video brought me back to my childhood, when we watched the Ed Sullivan Show and you saw the Tempatations, The Supremes, The Jackson 5, James Brown, and that's just to mention a few.  I'm so glad to have been brought up on this era of music. The Motown movement! This video is excellent.  I cried and I laughed.  I love the original Temptations, and this is the kind of music that our kids of today are deprived of.  These are the songs that will always be with me. Ofcourse, since this movie is based on the true life stories of these wonderful performers, that just makes it all the more interesting, so this movie was a great idea.  These guys really loved each other and it also shows you the different personality types they possessed.  Each Temptation was fundamental in the creation of this successful group.  In this video you hear alot of the popular songs they sang which to me are classic R&B.  Music for lovers and music that makes a girl feel special and puts the ""L"" in Love.  Makes you feel BRAND NEW, if you know what I mean. You will not regret purchasing this video! This movie you'll watch over and over again.",1028592000,,1350,4.395161290322581

I am only 16 yeras old who listen to nothing but oldies. I tell my mom everyday I wish lived to see The Temptations perform. I would been at every concert that was held in Philadelphia because I live right outside of Philly. I just love Paul Williams. I love his voice and I love the fact that he wouldn't let his health problems get to him. He loved to dance and he loved to performed. I don't think he killed himself because I was reading this article and it stated that he had his beer in his right hand and his gun in his left hand and the bullet came through the right side of his head.

I cannot attest to the truth or untruth of the video, but I can say that in my opinion it was very good!  I was impressed with the actors.  They are not only very talented but also very handsome men.

It gave me me goose bumps.  After I watched the mini series.  I found a whole new appreciation for Paul Williams.  He seemed to be a tortured soul.  It was very sad that he was so depressed that he took his own life.  I really enjoyed the movie.  I bought the tape 3 different times. Altough I haven't watched the movie in quite some time, when I first got it I watched it repeatedly and even got others to watch it.  Evey time that I  watched it felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster.  Although I didn't get all of the information and I am not sure how much of it was real (Melvin's death scene for one)  However, when Smokey Robinson sang Really Gonna miss you, I cried like a baby.  I haven't listened to it in a while.  I have to be in  an certain emotional mood in order to listen to it, because it is so emotionally draining.  If I need to cry but can't quite get it out, all I have to do is play the song and it's all over. I wish there was more information about Melvin, Eddie David's life.  Otis's wife and children were shown and so was Paul's family.  However; I really enjoyed the movie very much.  And I am really sorry that I missed out on the book.  Is there going to be another book?  I really hope so. When I first saw the miniseries, I found it to be a really sad story.

Since then, The Temptations and their music has become a daily occurance in my life.  No matter how many times that you watch this move, you are engrossed by the stories of the five members, through their troubled and through the great times.  Supported by a fine cast of characters, played by some very talented actors (Leon is superb as David Ruffin,) what sets this movie alight is the music.  I do not think that there are too many better songs recorded than 'Get Ready.' With Eddie Kendricks' falsetto and Melvin Franklin's bass voice supported by the other three Temptations, it is one of the most catchy songs that I have ever heard.  Kendricks' falsetto singing voice is only second, in my opinion, to Brian Wilson of the Beach  Boys. This movie is well worth the money and you will find yourself enjoying it over and over again.  I know that my friends who are not into the older style music, have really opened up and now The Temptations are part of their lives as well.

That was one of the movies my family  sat down to watch last Christmas.  The acting was great.  I hadn't known  too much about the individual Temptations - so this movie really told me a  lot.  The music and the performances were so good - I often hear people  (from family members to my hairdresser) talking about the movie and  actually trying to perform some of those dance steps!!
The movie had so  many moments - quite a few full of laughter and even those to make you cry.  I really had no idea that the group had gone through so many break-ups and  all of the different members.  I also enjoyed getting to see a little bit  of young Smokey Robinson (and the real Mr. Robinson at the burial scene),  the Supremes and Berry Gordy.
Basically, the movie was good enough to  make you wanna go out and buy those old Temptations records.  In the  meantime, I think I'll go dig out my video of the Motown 25 Anniversary  special!",968803200,3,1039,4.329842931937173

Like any biography,some things were changed for dramatic purposes(like Paul Williams really dying in August of '73,not in '72)or never mentioned (like Ruffin & Melvin were cousins),but it was enjoyable & finally gives props to Paul Williams,a fantastic singer whose diminished role in the group was tragic,& of course,David Ruffin,the pi** & vineger of the infamously SMOOTH Temps. Damn the Emmys for overlooking Leon & Christian Payton. My biggest grips are the fact that since Otis Williams is the only surviving member of the ""CLASSIC FIVE""its from his perspective and much of it tends to shift into his personal life. I held off buying the video version due to the fact that the running time was much shorter than the TV version when I caved in & bought it ,I noticed many of the best parts were edited out(a portion of the groups first rehersal,at the table when David joins the group,the Motown picnic incident,and last but not least,David & Eddies duet of ""You're My Everything""),in favor of Otis's family scenes.

1009868,5,6305300887,"Oh my!!!  This movie is a great review of the Temptations Legacy!  I have to say, though, the television version (the longer version) captures some great and dramatic footage that the video doesn't.  Take, for instance,  when they were having the party at ""Mama Rose's"" house, and Paul  started singing the song ""For Once In My Life"" while sloshy  drunk.  That scene was so dramatic and tear-jerking because even though I'm  only 23 years old, I saw the Temptations with the Supremes on TCB and Paul  tore that song up!  His voice was so great on that show, y'all!!  When he  sang at the party, it was heart-breaking and tragic.  You felt the stress  and sorrow in his voice!!  Anyway, the movie is fabulous.  The actors  really portray the Temptations well!!!  Leon - the one who played David  Ruffin - was exact and to the point.  And some people don't know this, but  on some of the songs, it was Leon's real voice!  Songs like  ""Shout,"" and ""Beauty's Only Skin Deep.""  Leon can sing,  but I guess he prefers acting.  All of the actors portrayed their  characters well, but I have to give it to Leon and Christian Payton.  Their  portrayals of David Ruffin and Paul Williams were to a T.  My being a  singer myself, I would love to meet Christian Payton and sing a song with  him.  His voice is real good, and sounded so much like Paul's voice.  Hopefully, the TV version will aire again, so we can see the WHOLE movie!  Also, hopefully soon, Suzanne DePasse will come out with a movie on the  Supremes.  So many people are wondering about that.  You know, the woman  sitting by Melvin Franklin on the second Motor Town Review (from the movie)  sipping on a drink while the song ""Heatwave"" was playing would be  a good candidate for the character of Florence Ballard for the Supremes  movie.  She looks so much like her!  Or Faith Evans could play Flo also...  Anyway, back to the Temptations.  Buy the video!  It is worth it.  It will  mak you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you sing and rejoice, it  will make you go out and buy albums from the Temptations!

A true story of the Temps would have  to be told objectively, and within the time-frame of a Lonesome Dove epic!  People love the Temptations, and that (I would summize) is why no one wants  to say anything that might be construed as negative.  Neither do I.  It  didn't have enough intimacy (e.g., ""Cooley High"") that made you  endure to the characters- even without knowing who they were. I must be  true to my critical analysis of a group I have followed from the beginning.  As many have mentioned, the star of the show was, in fact, Leon- who  resembled Ruffin without trying and did a superb act.  The actor who played  Eddie was also good in capturing the sly mannerism of a Kendrick(s). In my  opinion, the actor who played Melvin acted well, but not as Melvin  Franklin. And, I had to keep reminding myself that it was Otis' character.  Same for Paul.  Dennis was okay, but his height towered over the rest.
