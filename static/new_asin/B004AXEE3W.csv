8421149,5,B004AXEE3W,"I'm all-but-completely ignorant of Max Linder, though I enjoy the films of Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, and Charlie Chaplin.  I purchased this for ""The Three Must-Get-Theres"" since I'm a big swashbuckler aficionado and Jeffrey Richards' ""Swordsman of the Screen"" highly recommends it as a perfect parody.  It is!  It's very funny and its authentic-looking costumes and sets (and fine swordplay!) are sent-up with deliberate anachronisms such as motorcycles and telephones.  Linder makes an energetic and engaging d'Artagnan-parody, and the film is brisk and delightful.
""Seven Years Bad Luck"" is equally entertaining.  The gags are very funny (including a clever and hilarious missing-mirror sequence, made years before the iconic Marx Brothers one in ""Duck Soup""), the plot is quite entertaining -- the 48-minutes pass quickly and pleasurably!  My husband and I laughed throughout both movies, and we're no comedy pushovers!
The quality of the prints is good, especially considering they're over 90-years old.  The scores are modern and witty, if occasionally too broad, and far more interesting than the average silent movie score.  The DVD gives no indication of the composer and the menu is bare-bones.
This is a ""must"" for any fan of silent comedy.",1371600000,3,1253,5.38974358974359
