8457518,5,B00555FDMA,"""Rabies,"" branded as Israel's first horror film, is not horror in the traditional sense, wherein a particular antagonist runs amok. It's horror in the vein of Jean-Paul Sartre's ""No Exit,"" in which he posits, ""Hell is other people.""

That's not to say that ""Rabies,"" shot in 19 days on a meager half-million-dollar budget, is only a psychological study -- although it is, at heart, an allegory on society, at least that which exists in Israel. There's plenty of physical violence, and ample scenes of blood and gore in a film that, at the outset, appears to be an homage to cat-and-mouse slasher classics, such as ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Halloween"" (but just the first installment, please).

""Rabies"" opens with a young woman stuck in an elaborate underground trap in the woods. When her significant other goes for help, a chain of events is set in motion like some perverse Rube Goldberg machine. A chain of events that brings a lot of random strangers together in a series of violent explosions of primal rage.

By the time a deviant, unstable police officer enters the tale -- coinciding with three other characters' discovery that the forest is riddled with bear traps and land mines -- it's readily apparent that writers/directors Navot Papushado and Aharon Keshales had tongues planted firmly in cheek when they were making this film.

To be sure, ""Rabies"" is a visceral thrill ride. You don't need a seat belt, but you do need to strap on a healthy sense of humor. Black humor. Pitch black.

The supposed ""psychotic serial killer"" who set the underground trap, according to the film's synopsis? He merely provides the impetus; he's no more guilty than any other character, and actually less than some, by the time the film ends.

If ""Rabies"" is suggesting that some virus has paralyzed Israeli society, then the point is well-taken. But, on the flip side, the wife of an estranged, kindhearted cop suggests something else toward the end of the film, heartened by a communication that is ""open and honest and simple."" She suggests that maybe it's just as easy to dig yourself out of a hole, like the trap in the opening scene, as it is to succumb to the pitfalls that put us there.

Perhaps there is hope, after all, in this dark moral fable.

P.S.: I caught this recently at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival in San Francisco; here's hoping the film gets a DVD release in the U.S.",1312675200,,2395,4.7542168674698795
