Some of the DVD's out there teach advanced tricks and some teach basic things like how to pick out a cage or feed your bird (which most people already know by the time they go looking for a DVD) but this DVD was great because it has everything.  It starts out by teaching you how to tame your bird and it gets used to being touched or pet.  My African Grey parrot hated fingers and did not like to be pet at all, he would bite immediately.  But after using the instructions in this video, I was able to tame by bird in about 3 days.  Now he loves being pet and has not bit me once while petting him. The DVD also shows how to do deal with a screaming bird and advanced things like rolling your bird over, doing card tricks, waving, shaking head yes or no, etc.  There are 3 different segments on the DVD and also a bonus segment about clicker training.  The DVD was several hours long and I felt that I really got my moneys worth.  Don't me mislead by the photo showing a VHS box, it is really a DVD as described.  I wish Amazon would re-title this item, because it is hard to search for and does not come up when you search for bird training or parrot training for some reason.  So if you're lucky enough to find it, you should consider buying it.",1122681600,,1384,4.126865671641791
