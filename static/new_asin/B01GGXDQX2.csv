7760228,4,B01GGXDQX2,"The Sasha Banks & Bayley vs. Charlotte & Dana Brooke tag match was a good tag match. Both faces were getting worked on for a few minutes, then when Banks got that hot tag she was on fire. The finish with Charlotte tapping out sets up the obvious Banks vs. Charlotte match at SummerSlam that we have been expecting since WrestleMania. Thats where Banks should win the Womens Title. As for Bayley, it sounded like she won't be on the main roster full time after this because JBL said it was a one time thing from his sources. Im not sure how they are going to explain it. Im just glad Bayley was a part of it and the crowd reacted to her in a big way. That was awesome to see. Shell probably be on the main roster post SummerSlam. The The New Day (Xavier Woods, Big E & Kofi Kingston) vs. The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Erick Rowan & Braun Strowman) 6 man tag match was a slow match in the first five minutes and then the pace really picked up. My prediction was the Wyatt Family winning because I thought Wyatt should look strong going into his role as a Smackdown guy because hes a top two heel on that brand. Woods was awesome in the match. He isn't always booked strongly, but he did well here. Who cares if he got pinned? The crowd loved him. Wyatt was able to outsmart him for the finish, though. I hope Big Es okay after that bump outside the ring. He may be told to stop doing that spear to the floor bump because it could hurt him or somebody else some day soon. Also, it was noticeable that Strowman barely did anything in the match. I thought they might have him stand out more, but he really didn't do much. The United States Title: Rusev (w/Lana) vs. Zack Ryder was a basic match to put over the US Champion. I didn't see Ryder having much of a shot. He actually hit all of his big moves, but didn't go for the pin after the Rough Ryder. Instead, he went for the elbow drop off the top, Rusev blocked it and finished it two moves later. I like the way that Rusev has been booked in the last few months. He should be a force on the Raw brand going forward. The Sami Zayn vs. Kevin Owens match was an incredible match. What a performance by both Zayn and Owens. The crowd was really into it. It was better than their Payback match was and that was a lot of fun to watch too. There were big spots in the match like the brainbuster on the apron. Zayns fall during the springboard moonsault attempt looked bad, but Im glad Zayn was able to get through the match. I know some people think they do this match too much and maybe thats true, but when its as good as this match was how can you complain? I definitely wont. They are two of the best in-ring performers with incredible chemistry. How many standing ovations do you see during a match? Doesnt happen often. One of the best matches of the year  probably #2 right now. I think Nakamura vs. Zayn in Dallas was still the best WWE match this year, though. The Natalya vs. Becky Lynch match had good story in the match with Natalya working on the knee for the entire match. I figured she would win, but I thought she would cheat more for it. She really didn't cheat other than that kick to the knee when the ref was backing up Lynch. I thought Lynch did a good job of showing babyface heart as she always does. As for the crowd, they weren't into it that much because of how good Zayn/Owens was before it. Im glad they got more than five minutes, though. At least it gives them a shot to tell a story, which they did. This feud will likely continue on the Smackdown brand. The Intercontinental Title: The Miz (w/Maryse) vs. Darren Young (w/Bob Backlund) was a below average match. They just didn't really have much of a flow to it and nothing interesting happened until Backlund was freaking out on the floor. Im not even sure what the finish was because they never announced anything. Miz is on Smackdown and Young is on Raw, so I guess thats the end of this storyline. Weird way to end it. The John Cena, Enzo Amore & Big Cass vs. AJ Styles, Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson 6 man tag match was a really good tag match for the most part. I liked the energy of the match as they did some big spots towards the end of it. It was a bit weird near the end when Cena and Styles were outside the ring for more than a minute, yet the ref was in the ring watching the other guys battle it out even though they shouldnt have even been in there. The announcers tried to cover for the ref saying he was just letting the guys fight, but its a bit sloppy. Cena getting the pin on Styles was done to set up the rematch at SummerSlam. Fine with me. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins vs. Roman Reigns was a very good triple threat match. Considering it was the first time they had a three way match (on the main roster) they told an awesome story. It started out with Rollins getting in a lot of offense, then Reigns got going and dominated with his power. I liked the part where Rollins and Ambrose worked together to drive Reigns through the table. The crowd loved it too. The finish was set up pretty well because it was all about Roman and Seth battling eachother, then Roman hit his finish and Ambrose was right there to hit Roman with his finish to win the match. Smart booking for the champion Ambrose. I picked Rollins to win, but I don't mind Ambrose carrying the title. Reigns taking the pin was the obvious choice. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1472256000,,5430,4.216138328530259

7760230,4,B01GGXDQX2,"It should be noted that WWE once again began their brand extension with superstars drafted exclusively to RAW & SmackDown making some of the matches now inter-promotional encounters.

Sasha Banks & Bailey vs. Charlotte & Dana Brooke - NXT superstar Bailey made her main roster debut as Sasha's mystery partner with Charlotte & Dana attempting to get the advantage before the match taking it to the outside only for Sasha & Bailey to come back with some aerial moves from different positions as both teams traded momentum with one team using whatever tactics possible to constantly keeping her opponent in their half of the ring away from her partner while the other team just kept bringing the fight overcoming each time their momentum was stopped in a fun opening match.

New Day vs. Wyatt Family - It should be noted that the draft caused this to be the final time this version of the Wyatt's (Bray Wyatt, Erik Rowan, Brawn Stroman) would be teaming together.  The Wyatt's were in control grounding one of their opponents using different tactics while playing mind games while The New Day relied on their individual strengths from power to athleticism with both teaming trading momentum from double teaming to distractions building to the ultimate moment between two that's been building for weeks in a good match that had a payoff in the ring & with the crowd reaction for the story they were telling plus it's the best I've even seen Strowman in action.

United States Champion Rusev vs. Zack Ryder - This turned out to be a RAW vs. SmackDown encounter now due to the draft as Rusev was dominate from the beginning keeping it on the mat with a ""ground & pound"" offense along with strong kicks focusing on an area of the body only for Ryder to keep bringing the fight to him & even able to counter his offense with some of his own with both men using the environment on the outside to their advantage in a solid encounter & Ryder's best showcasing in a big match since WrestleMania.

Sami Zayn vs. Kevin Owens - This was set to be their final encounter as this was physical from the start as both men threw each other into the barricades early on as one man was able to get the advantage due to mistiming with stiff chops & kicks keeping his opponent on the mat while his opponent was able to still delivering some impactful offense but had another mistiming leading to him getting injured as they continued to trade momentum with one man heavily focusing on the injured body part of his opponent while his opponent had some impactful offense of his own & both men going through a sequence of counters & reversals plus being able to stop the other's offense dead in it's tracks with a high impact move in an awesome match competitive encounter causing this match to be J.B.L.'s ""Someone call the sheriff cause they just stole the show"" match of the night.

Becky Lynch vs. Natayla - Becky was able to keep taking her down & advantage of her constant distractions by the fans & the referee causing Natayla to keep going to the outside to break the momentum before finally taking advantage of her surrounds to heavily work over a body part using different stretches & submissions but Becky kept taking advantage of any openings to go after the arm delivering strong & explosive offense of her own in a match that told a good story of each working over a body part for their respective submissions but in a bad spot following the previous match.

Intercontinental Champion The Miz vs. Darren Young - Young had his coach Bob Backlund in his corner while Miz had his wife Maryse in his with the outfits they wore to the ring referenced an infamous movie starring another then-Hollywood couple that definitely doesn't fall in the ""PG"" rating as this was also another RAW vs. SmackDown match due to the draft.  Young was able to control Miz taking him repeatedly off his feet for near falls before a distraction & timing allowed Miz to take advantage using various tactics only for Young to continue to stay a step ahead causing Miz to take drastic action that ultimately lead to things getting way out of control as this was easily the weakest match of the night due to it never really leaving first gear & the finish not helping matters.

John Cena, Big Cass, Enzo vs. The Club - This was a situation similar to the Wyatt Family earlier in the night where this was the last match that The Club would wrestle as a team due to A.J. Styles (SmackDown), Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson (RAW) being drafted to different shows while I normally don't comment on this but Enzo's pre-match in-ring promo was worth the applause it got from not just Cena himself but the crowd causing them to have a funny chant towards Styles.  Both teams traded momentum from the start with one team using his own partner as a weapon & using the momentum of one his opponents against his own team while the opposing team was able to single out one & working him over in their half of the ring with each partner taking turns working him over keeping him away from his partner as the action did eventually breakdown with sequences of one big move after another & even competitors accidentally hitting their own partners whenever they went saving them from a pinfall in what was a fun match from start to finish.

Right around here was Chris Jericho's ""Highlight Reel"" with Randy Orton's return for the first time in almost a year with both men taking some jabs at each other while also discussing Orton's upcoming match at SummerSlam against Brock Lesnar with Orton giving the line of the night which was even more comedic with it coming from him of all people with his past violations.  Normally I don't like long talk segments on PPV's & think to save that for the free TV show but it worked here & did it's job.

WWE Champion Dean Ambrose vs. Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins - A couple of notes here in that these three men within the last 10 mins. of the previous PPV all held the WWE Championship, they were the members of The Shield, this was the last time all three men would face off against each other for the WWE Championship with Roman & Seth going to RAW while Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown, and both authority figures from the shows (Stephanie McMahon & Mick Foley for RAW while Shane McMahon & Daniel Bryan represented SmackDown) were at ringside along with the rosters watching in their own separate locker rooms due to the importance of where the title would be after this match.  This match had some highlights such as one person being the odd man out with one opponent going straight after him at the start only for the third opponent to keep feeding him to his other opponent to the point that they kept focusing on him whenever he was in the ring, various times when two men were so concentrated on each other that it allowed the third man to take them both out, the action going all around ringside with various weapons coming into play, sequences of one big move hit after another, and different ""deja vu"" moments from their past together in nothing short of one hell of a main event match.

(Kickoff Show) The Usos vs. Breezango - Tyler Breeze & Fandango attempted to ground the Usos early on only for them to come back with their trademark offense of strong kicks & aerial offense working them over either as a team or an individual only for Breezango to catch them & break up attempted double teaming & take advantage of a counter they had for one of their signature maneuvers in a quick but solid match.

This was a good follow up the previous Money In The Bank PPV as there was only one bad match (Miz/Young) with the action there along with some nice surprises & other superstars giving some of their best performances in recent months so this is definitely worth a viewing.",1469750400,5,7770,4.559139784946237

BATTLEGROUND 2016

1. BREEZANGO VS THE USOS-this was actually a really good way to start out the night. This was a fast paced full of action tag match that the fans were into. They were also very much against the soon to turn but still face Usos here. This was a fun match that really showed me that Breezango could actually be something. Good back and forth that sees the face Usos lose clean.

2. CHARLOTTE & DANA BROOKE VS SASHA BANKS & BAYLEY-the first match of the PPV is also a tag match this time being a womens tag match. In this one Champ Charlotte and Brooke take on Sasha Banks and mystery partner Bayley. When Bayley comes out the crowd goes crazy for her and it is clear that she would be coming to the main roster soon enough. This was a good but somewhat short match with some good back and forth action. I had a feeling that Sasha and Bayley would go over here and they did. Sasha makes the champ tap out.

3. THE NEW DAY VS THE WYATT FAMILY-this was a fun feud going into this match and I love all of these guys involved in the match. This was a great match that the fans were really into, especially with Woods. Anytime he was in their against Bray they went crazy. The story about him being afraid of Bray played out well here and promoted the crowd to go crazy as he built up to overcoming that fear. He eventually does but The Wyatts pull out the win regardless in their last match together.

4.[US TITLE]RUSEV VS ZACK RYDER-this was a much better match than I am sure people thought it would be. It lasted the perfect amount of time and showcased both men well. I really liked the ending with Rusev retaining after Ryder almost pulled it out. His partner Mojo Riley from NXT showed up to make the save after the match.

5. KEVIN OWENS VS SAMI ZAYN-this was the match of the night as these two long time rivals just went at it. The action is fast paced and all over the place. Both men use some excellent offense as they both trade momentum. These two always work very well together and put on another classic and possibly steal the show. Zayn gets the win here in what was advertised as their last meeting.

6. NATALYA VS BECKY LYNCH-I like both of these ladies, well I love Nattie so in all honesty I was rooting for her. This was a good match that would see Natalya really work Becky over setting multiple submissions. Lynch would have moments that would make it competitive but a sharpshooter from the vet would lead to Natalya winning.

7.[I-C TITLE]THE MIZ VS DARREN YOUNG-a better match than people give it credit for. This was a good back and forth match with both managers getting involved. Young looked like he might pull out the victory but with The Miz getting involved with Bob Backland on the outside it lead to the distraction. This caused both men to get counted out and then Yong would not release the cross face chicken wing, good match over all.

8. THE CLUB VS JOHN CENA, ENZO & BIG CASS-probably the most fun match on the card. The pre match stuff with Cena, Enzo and Cass was funny and then the match its self was just great. This was a fast paced match that kept the fans entertained. Each person looked great here having various moments for themselves. Great back and forth action with The Club taking the L in their final bout together which still kinda upsets me. Many near falls with split second saves which always gets the fans going. Cena of course gets the win after an AA off of the ropes.

Here we get the Highlight Reel segment with Y2J interviewing the returning Randy Orton about his upcoming Summerslam match against Brock Lesnar. This was a fun segment with both guys delivering in the humor department.

9.[WWE TITLE]DEAN AMBROSE VS SETH ROLLINS VS ROMAN REIGNS-this was an excellent main event, but with these three could you be surprised by that. The action in this match was fast paced and went all over the place. These guys battled all over the ring and ringside, even hitting a very familiar powerbomb but to someone you not think would ever take it. This was the match that would also determine where the WWE Title would be going as Ambrose was on his way to Smackdown away from his former Shield buddies. Ambrose would retain in a very hard fought and excellent battle.

This was a really good event that would see the brands split after this. If you are a wrestling fan then I highly recommend this event.",1487030400,,4378,4.399258343634116
