1633905,5,B00005NFL5,"Fantastic acting, great story line, a disturbing and thought provoking film about the sexual awaking of a woman, verbally abused by her mother.  A prim and proper piano teacher, Isabelle Huppert spends her off time in porn shops and peep shows.  A brash young student captures her attention, and awakens her deepest and darkest sexual desires.  The unrated version is a must see for any Foreign film fan.",1036108800,,404,4.911764705882353
1633906,5,B00005NFL5,"I've yet to see this DVD release, but the theatrical release was brilliant.  The film does a wonderful job of bringing Elfriede Jelenek's book to the screen.",1033171200,2,157,4.814814814814815
1633907,5,B00005NFL5,"In French, with English subtitles, this film is a risky psychological drama about a well-respected music professor at a prestigious Vienna music school.  She's in her forties, wears no makeup, keeps her hair in a bun and dresses in the plainest of clothes.  As a teacher, she is severe and demanding.  She and her mother live together and their constant arguments include slaps and tears and reconciliation.  Her secret life, however, includes pornography, voyeurism and genital self-mutilation. When an attractive young man starts to pursue her romantically, she shocks him with her perversions. How this all plays out is fascinating and the eventual conclusion is inevitable, but along the way the audience is plunged into this very unsettling world.
Isabelle Huppert's performance as the teacher is absolutely magnificent.  There are a lot of close-ups of her unsmiling freckled face and dark opaque emotionless eyes.  There is a vague reference to her father being in an insane asylum; other than that there is no back-story to help us understand her.  Benoit Magimel, cast as her young suitor, has a difficult role as well.  During the course of the film, we watch him change before our eyes.  All the other characters are also well cast and give outstanding performances.
The director, Michael Haneke, kept the tension and erotic undercurrent strong throughout. There is a lot of classical music and scenes of recitals and piano lessons in a very rigid and upscale world. And then there are those scenes targeted to make the audience squirm in their seats. When all the elements are put together, the results are a film that will long haunt my memories.
The Piano Teacher is not for everyone.  But for those adventurous few who are willing to experience the different and dramatic, don't miss it.",1030924800,61,1802,5.037037037037037
1633908,5,B00005NFL5,"...I considered Chapter 5 to be very important. This is the kind of movie that has to be viewed in its entirety, from beginning to end without interruption. I am not especially fund of dark stories, of sadomasochism. You may want to hold on to something that would make you feel secure and safe while viewing this movie. In a world of dysfunction, the main character, Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika Kohut is among the top. She is a forty year-old piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory (incidentally she thinks that none of her pupils are good enough). She lives with her mother who worries about her daughter but in actuality is unable to face the fact that her daughter is an adult. Their co-dependency would make you sad. They sleep on the same bed and they even have fistfights! This dysfunctional relationship makes Erika among other things a voyeur. Erika meets a young man, whom she uses to act on her secret desires. He is sympathetically played by Benoit Magimel. Somewhere along the movie you wish she would listen to this man, but this is not a love story although a lot of `I love you' statements are uttered. Even the boyfriend thinks she is sick. It was petrifying to watch a scene where Erika performs an act of self-mutilation. The film never shows the details but the effect is tremendous. This movie drives you on the edge of your seat. It was a relief  when it ended, although quite abruptly, so there goes another French movie that will make you think for a long time after the last frame.
If you are already a fan of Isabelle Huppert, you will find this extraordinary and remarkable performance indeed worthy of a Best Actress award (2001 Cannes Film Festival). But if you cringe at the thought of a man hitting a woman but would like to get to know Isabelle Huppert, do not make this be your first movie. Watch something like Entre Nous or wait for Huit Femmes (8 femmes, also a 2001 movie). The Piano teacher is not yet rated in the US but if `Elizabeth' gets an `R', this movie easily deserves it.",1026518400,12,2028,4.540983606557377
1633909,5,B00005NFL5,"o.m.g! this film is absolutely brilliant!__the intensity, the actors, music, directing...
MICHAEL HANEKE's style is a little like a combination of kubrick and gaspar noe.
i honestly don't know if haneke's adaptation is faithful to Elfriede Jelinek's novel ""the piano teacher"".
however, this film is so intense, so captivating..(and even funny)...
plot:
erika kohut is a middle aged piano teacher of the vienna music conservatory who is still living with her possessif mother.
she appears to be normal.
however, she is a sadomasochrist. She watches porn while sniffing used condoms,cuts herself with razor blades and..well..you get the picture.
she's a sadistic loner. she does not want to be loved,but humiliated and tortured.
Walter, is her admirant student.
he is fascinated and he adores her.
what follows next, is their strange relationship.
in short , Humiliation is part of the menu....
i think this film was rated nc17, but i'm not sure..anyway,do not bring any children with you!!
some scenes are really extreme!..apart from that,on a technical level, this film is perfect.
ISABELLE HUPPERT is not acting in this film, she's living her part.
she is incomparable.
defenitly the best actress of 2002
even the brilliant Naomi watts (of mulholland drive), is no match to huppert.
BENOIT MAGIMEL and annie girardot, are also Really, impressive!!
there are no false notes.
the conclusion of the film is sudden and imprevisible.
(like in every haneke films)

1633910,4,B00005NFL5,"Michael Haneke has adapted Elfriede Jelinek's novel to create this disturbing psychological portrait of piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert). Erika's claustrophobic life is filled with strict teachings and moral hypocrisy. She is a voyeur and masochist beneath her rigid exterior. Her life becomes desperate upon meeting a new student Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel). Their relationship becomes tumultuous when it becomes increasingly clear that she is incapable of nothing like a ""normal"" romance.
This tragedy is at many times shocking and is likely to make you squirm in discomfort over the deranged levels of Erika's mentality. While frequently repulsed, I felt an odd sympathy for her at times over the fragility of her being and her difficulty with expressing love. The cinematography of this film is bleak. The atmosphere seems glazed with an impersonality and stark indifference equal to that of Erika's spirit. The air is bizarrely punctuated with the beauty of the many musical recitals throughout the film. Director Haneke has been much criticised for this work (it has been dismissed as pretentious). Though not for the faint of heart or morally concerned, I found it strangely moving and engaging in the way it unsettles.",1018310400,11,1242,5.341836734693878
1633911,5,B00005NFL5,"I saw this film in Paris last October. Director, Michael Haneke has delivered an incredibly powerful film based on a controversial Austrian novel. Isabelle Huppert plays Erika, a brilliant piano professor at a college in Vienna. At work she is respected among her peers and indimidating to her students. At home, she lives with her tyrant mother (Annie Girardot). Erika and her mother have an emotionally abusive co-dependent relationship to the point where they share the same bedroom. Erika's sex life consists of eerie visits to porno shops and sadistic self-mutilation. When one of her students (Benoit Magimel) attempts to seduce her, she agrees but on HER terms.
A family film this is not. There are some very disturbing scenes of emotional and physical abuse. But as difficult as the subject matter is, it does help the viewer to understand the psyche of a woman who has been denied happiness all her life. Isabelle Huppert is fantastic in a very difficult role. Her performance of the tortured Erika is the only time, I've seen a character so disturbed and cruel who I found pity in and wanted to see succeed. Forget the Oscar nominations, this is the best female performance of the year! Annie Girardot and Benoit Magimel are wonderful and very convincing in their roles as well. Lastly, the director, Michael Haneke. I've never seen any of his previous work but few directors have the ability to take complete control of my attention and keep it long after their film is over. Haneke is one of the very few who did. ""La Pianiste"" is a masterpiece, I recommend it to anyone who has an appreciation for European cinema.",1016064000,48,1627,4.835125448028674
1633912,5,B00005NFL5,"This film is a haunting masterpiece that offers up one of the most nuanced psychological portrayals ever committed to film. It is typical Haneke: brutally difficult to watch at points, unrelenting in playing with viewer expectations, and purposefully inconclusive. But if you allow Haneke to force your attention to the film in all of its depravity, you will marvel at its brilliant contemplation of loneliness, artistic sacrifice, perversion, the interplay and eroticism of human power dynamics, and the painful realization that aesthetic representation is often divorced from lived experience. Lots of films have taken up the bizarre and sometimes perverse undercurrents that exist just beneath the surface of high society, but none have done so with this level of raw, uncompromising detail. Huppert's performance is immensely powerful and manages to somehow be torturing and beautiful at the same time.
This is not a film for everyone. It is guaranteed to ruin a casual movie night, but it is the type of film that, when watched with an open mind, will change your life.",1470960000,5,1074,5.213872832369942

Unknown to him, the passions that stir within her are far more destructive and disturbing than he could have suspected.

I realize that my synopsis makes this excellent film sound like a thriller a la Fatal Attraction.  Instead it is an absorbing, hypnotic character study that generates more suspense than most conventional thrillers as we ponder the mysterious inner scars that motivate this damaged woman.  Huppert is by turns incredibly sympathetic and genuinely repulsive in one of the most powerful performances I have seen in recent years.",1447545600,,758,5.291666666666667

Great cinema is about effective story-telling.  It is not a question of feeding the viewer feel-good candy-floss, however much Hollywood may consider it otherwise.

It has a very strong, difficult, script, about an artist on the edge of madness.
It has good direction.
It has good camera work.

1633925,5,B00005NFL5,"LA PIANISTE (THE PIANO TEACHER) goes places most film makers dare not tread - the dark aspects of frustrated sexuality where desire and affection cannot meet. In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings. This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy. Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict.

The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilaration that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and distorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a disturbing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed. Grady Harp, July 11",1311811200,,1988,5.2125

1633927,2,B00005NFL5,"Superbly acted by Huppert, but couldn't get past the painful granularity of a character that leaves the viewer no choice but to despise her. Her passive-aggressive sadism towards others is born out of the hatred she has for herself. Among the physical abuse she commits against herself in various ways, she also commits the worst kind of betrayal - a teacher who hates her own pupils to the point of committing acts of violence against them - no one is safe around her - she hates all equally. She pours broken glass into a student's coat pocket out of some senseless deranged jealousy, thus completely destroying that student's hope for a career as a pianist. As equally as she doles out the psychological and physical abuse (there is a revolting scene of some sort of bizarre sexual attack she commits against her own mother, whom she sleeps with in the same bed), she also demands to be abused. She asks her student-boyfriend to beat her (and he obliges, seemingly with some regret) but that can't compare with how much she hates herself.

Instead of caring about this character, I found myself disgusted by her (mostly because of her own weakness and unwillingness to change). This woman puts on an air of strength, stoicism, and intelligence, but it is really just a cover for her weakness as a person devoid of any conscious. She is too weak to break the sick relationship she has with her dominating mother, so her life is a gradual escalation of a psychosis that she allows to destroy her. She is a dangerous, sociopathic individual with no hope, so the entire film becomes a disturbing examination of that.",1303603200,5,1615,4.726950354609929
1633928,5,B00005NFL5,"She lives with her mother. It is an oppressive relationship. They sleep in the same bedroom. The mother is very suspicious of her behaviour; rummaging for evidence of things sexually illicit.

She is a piano teacher; a strict one and slightly bored. However, she plays beautifully. That is what inspires an already fine young player to seek her tuition, to elevate his skills further. He plays after her superb recital. She feigns indifference. The film proceeds with his pursuit of her tuition skills. What transpires between them becomes electrifying.

In one scene, she walks into a sex shop and is `eyed' with suspicion by men doing the same thing, as she waits for a viewing kiosk. She enjoys hard-core porn'. A man who does this is just that but a woman? Judgements abound! Why?

The film oscillates between these extremes; exquisite culture and hard-core interests. It is fascinating on both counts.",1300492800,,906,4.986754966887418
1633929,2,B00005NFL5,The acting was good for what it was.  The opinion I have after watching it was the movie was someone's spoof of what BDSM was.  The ending just left me with my mouth hanging open and shaking my head in wonderment.,1298937600,,213,4.170731707317073
1633930,1,B00005NFL5,"Shortly before seeing this film, I watched a DVD of Bertolucci's "" The Dreamers"", both for the first time. It was informative to compare the two products of film-makers who are regarded as serious practitioners of the Art, and whose work often incorporates explicitly sexual material that risks demeaning their serious intent and exposes them to the charge of gratuitous audience titillation. In the case of Bertolucci's movie, the sex was graphic and not in the best of taste, but one could argue that it had a place in the lives of its young protagonists who were representative of much of their generation: narcissistically focused upon their own self-gratification and freedom of expression at a time when freedom of expression as a whole was under restraint by the State. Not until their indulgence brought their cocooned existence crashing down did they see fit to join those at the barricades fighting for universal freedom.

With ""The Piano Teacher"", it is an altogether different matter. We are exposed to two hours of sordid behaviour, self-destructive as well as destructive of others, by a totally deranged individual (Erika) with no redeeming feature beyond a certain musical talent, and no causal factor other than a domineering mother and a father who is mentioned only briefly, but who apparently went mad and killed himself. Even if we accept these as partially exonerating, it still leaves the whole experience as no more than a case-history of lunacy with no universal relevance and no political, moral, religious, ethical or philosophical purpose. The interview with Isabelle Huppert, who plays Erika, included with this DVD reveals the lack of anything meaningful that all concerned in its production have to communicate to its audience. She describes the objective of the director and the motivation of the central character that she plays as an attempt to explore the search for "" true love without the taint of seduction"". What garbage! On this premise, genital mutilation, maternal incest, fornication on the floor of a public toilet, and submission to requested flagellation and physical brutality, all become justified as acts of ""true love"". It is clear that Huppert has no valid idea of why she is doing the awful things she is required by the director to perform; viewed in this light, her much-lauded performance becomes no more than a meaningless charade
involving a limited repertoire of scowling gestures and hysterical outbreaks
that soon become boring and irritating to watch.

It does not help that the other characters are equally unattractive, at least in their behaviour. As the object of  Erika's perversions, Benoit Magimel initially presents as a sensitive and charismatic young man, but his descent into frenetic violence instead of simply walking away from an impossibly unsavoury relationship ruptures that bond of empathy with the viewer. The technical skills of Michael Haneke  are evident in the composition of many of the frames and sequences that give this film an artistic texture, coupled with the gorgeous music of Schubert, Bach and others that introduce brief interludes of sanitizing poetry. His serious talent, demonstrated in ""Cache"" and ""The White Ribbon"" persuaded me to discount the 16 1-star reviewers and heed the recommendations of the 54 who awarded the movie 5 stars, especially as many of the latter came from intelligent and critically eloquent film buffs. I was fully conditioned by his above-mentioned movies to become immersed in the lives of thoroughly unlikeable individuals, since these seem to represent the only segment of humanity in which he is interested. I expected the compensation of a challenging and thought-provoking experience in return. All I got was senseless depravity without meaning or justification.",1297900800,12,3792,5.252475247524752
1633931,4,B00005NFL5,"Where else could you set the story of a sexually-repressed masochistic woman except in Vienna, where ""hysteria"" was sufficiently common to provide a living wage for a cadre of 'alienists' which included one Sigmund Freud? And wouldn't Siggy have been delighted with this film! It's his whole corpus of psychoanalytic observation captured visually. Viewer beware! If you are inclined to regard Freudian psychology with skepticism, you'll detest this film. But it's not a balmy evening's entertainment by any measure. Erika --the 'piano teacher' acted with agonizing credibility by Isabelle Huppert -- is a loathsome harpy [ 'harpy' is an ancient Greek synonym for the B word ] and not the sort of victim of mental illness for whom you'll feel sympathy or pity. In fact, the only character in this film that drew any sympathy from me was the young woman piano student whom Erika victimized.

That student's mother is a pushy whiner, a perfect specimen of the new category of ""Tiger Mom."" Conservatory moms, let me tell you, are more than a match for soccer moms or hockey moms in tigerishness. But Erika's mom, acted by Annie Girardot, is the veritable Medusa or Mozart's Queen of the Night. I know nothing at all about the biography of director Michael Haneke except that his mother was an Austrian actress, but I can't help imagining that he has ""issues"" with parenting. This is the second film of his that I've seen in one week. I chose his 2009 film 'The White Ribbon' at my local video rental shop, chiefly because of the photo on the box. That film impressed me enough that I went back to rent 'The Piano Teacher,' a film released in 2001. In the newer film, it's Fatherhood that takes the rap for sociopathy, while in this older film, Motherhood catches some of the blame for psychosis. See what I mean? I can't wait to see what hatefulness Haneke attributes to the influence of uncles!

Music is the lubricant for perverse attractions in this film. The handsome, sensitive, accomplished young man -- Walter, acted by Benoit Magimel -- mistakes Erika's ardor for music for sensual passion; there could be no other explanation for his fixation on her, since she hardly exudes physicality. I wasn't entirely convinced by Walter's initial attraction to Erika. I had to 'willingly suspend disbelief' until the double helix of moral degeneration between the two started spiraling downwards. Music is used brilliantly in this film, edited so that the strains of Schubert persist across the temporal boundaries of scenes. Brilliant editing of both sound and picture is possibly the strongest asset of The Piano Teacher.

As I said above, this isn't a film you'll properly enjoy. It's brutally savage and too distorted to be tragic. In fact, if you empathize with this film, you might consider consulting a competent Freudian analyst; I can recommend one if you live in Stockholm. The merits of the film are chiefly 'artistic' and cinematographic: powerful dialogue and direction, excellent camera work and editing, stellar performances by Huppert, Girardot, and Magimel.",1296345600,5,3068,5.0

1633933,4,B00005NFL5,"I was taken aback by Isabelle Huppert's performance in this film. She plays a pianist instructor named Erika Kohut. Her self mutilation scenes made me cringe. Her mannerisms were so rigid and sharp.  I came to wonder how she was able to play music with such finesse. Benot Magimel as Walter Klemmer was excellent. He was just the total opposite of Erika. I'm not quite sure if it is realistic to have that kind of young man be attracted to such a repressive woman. From the start I could not help but feel that the relationship would fail, as it did. Most will be fooled by the cover of the DVD box. The film is not sensual at all. It is incredibly awkward due to Erika's inability to express love and affection. This realization of Erika's unhealthy psychological problems does not doom upon her until Erika goes into a fit of rage. Erika hits her elderly mother as well as attempts to make out with her. Erika is so confused in how to express her feelings. She had been anti-social for a long time. I wasn't surprised about her revealed fetishes. I always thought strict instructors had hidden eccentric oddities about themselves. Poor Walter couldn't hack it. Erika is impious anyway. I cannot believe what Erika did to her poor student. The way in which the opening credits were displayed is creative.  Some scenes were rather long, but the music in the background makes for good diversion. ""La Pianiste"" is certainly emotive. My only regret is that I have not read the book before watching the movie.",1287792000,,1505,4.632958801498128
1633934,5,B00005NFL5,"What some people might find unusual about the story of The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste) is how common it really is.  The vast numbers of sexually ""complicated"" people exist within our society and their individual tales are rarely discussed in popular culture.  Michael Haneke steps foward boldly to correct this problem.  Isabelle Huppert's Erika is an exceptionally talented artist and her needs are specific and frightening to those who do not understand the context of her nearly 50 years of life.  How can anyone understand anyone sexually?  It takes years to understand another individual, and the tragedy of The Piano Teacher is that the character Walter gives up on Erika before development can occur.  Frightened people do this in the ""dating"" world everyday.  I personally thank Michael Haneke and Elfriede Jelinek for this inspiring story every time I come home from another failed attempt at romance.  It keeps me going.",1284422400,3,930,5.153333333333333
1633935,5,B00005NFL5,"DivaHerHighness wonders why everybody is speaking French in a film that takes place in Vienna. I'll take a stab at it. It's true that director Michael Haneke is Austrian, but my guess is the best actors in European cinema today are French. Isabelle Huppert is one of the best and she proves it by portraying the complex role of the piano teacher. Watch her commentary that is included with this film, which is in English. She explains that the theme of the movie is that the piano teacher is afraid of being hurt. She wants love but not seduction and thus wants to control the relationship with her student. I would bet that she speaks good German, but wouldn't you rather hear her speak French?

This is my fourth Haneke film: three are in French and one is in German. Regardless of the language, they are all complex, intelligent films. I note some of the comments made by reviewers here: ""twisted cinema"", ""a very unsettling world"", ""provocative perversions"", ""beyond weirdness"", ""holy crap"" and much more. Sure, there is some nudity and unusual sexual behavior here. I would recommend that you not show it to your young children, but let's be adult here.

Did anyone notice the beautiful music in this film, most notably Schubert's next to last piano sonata in A major D.959 and Schubert's piano trio in E flat D.929, which is also a recurring theme in Stanley Kubrick's great film Barry Lyndon.",1277424000,,1399,4.729508196721311
1633936,5,B00005NFL5,"I happened to watch this film again last night, and I must say that Haneke is a director you have to allow to infiltrate you're way of thinking in order to really understand his work.  He has a very distinct viewpoint and is certainly a visionary, and so his films carry with them hidden layers of emotional confliction that I think are pertinent to appreciating them.  `La Pianiste' is a dark and disturbing film that could be (wrongfully) disregarded as perverse filth, but there is so much more involved here.

Throwing this film to the side due to its graphic nature is denying it the admiration it deserves.

The film centers around a middle aged woman named Erika Kohut, a piano teacher who lives at home with her mother and secretly hides her own perverse fantasies; sneaking off to buy smut and witness adult films.  Erika is cold and seemingly bitter, a woman who is envious of her young students and strangely dependant on her mother.  Her world is turned upside down when she encounters a young man named Walter Klemmer, an arrogant student with talent who cares little for music itself and more for the attention his hands can get him.  Erika is repulsed yet fascinated to the point where she dares let him inside her head.  Once he has been allowed to see her for who she really is, he challenges her, defying her wishes and showing her that her own desires are not necessarily her own.

Michael Haneke is known for his dissection of violence and society.  He is constantly tackling that very subject with fresh ideas that capitalize on his gritty sense of realism and sharp eye for detail.  Taking the lines one crosses, meshing together the emotions of love and hate, Haneke creates a startling character study that leaves the audience much like Erika, and later Walter...

Repulsed yet fascinated.

The character of Erika Kohut is a mesmerizing one, because she is so easily condemned for her actions and desires but this is a grave misunderstanding of a woman oppressed by her natural surroundings.  She is a woman who has suffered the loss of a father (to insanity) and continually suffers the confinement that comes from paternal control (her mother still treats her as if she were a child).  She is lost within her own passions, surrounded by young students who lack the knowledge she has yet she is grossly aware that they will amount to more than she ever will.  She is insulted by their mediocre talents.  Erika is also alone, lonely within her own view of love.  Being controlled and looked down on, she craves someone to dominate her.  She puts up the air that she is cruel and controlling and domineering, but she is begging, pleading with the world to knock her down.  She has such lack of control within her own life that she needs to control her idea of intimacy.  Finding escape in the voyeuristic engagements suited for a prepubescent boy, Erika taints her own understanding of love by feeding herself the filth propagated by the media.  She becomes her own worst enemy, and thus falls victim to her own carnal misunderstandings.

When Walter gives in and `gives her what she wants', it literally destroys her.

The film is, on its own, a masterpiece and a force to be reckoned with, but without the dedicated and fearless performance given by Isabelle Huppert the film would not have had nearly the effect needed to sustain it.  When you think of performances that `go there', that really throw caution to the wind and allow themselves to embody a single character, this is one that should instantly come to mind.  Huppert does shy away from the character flaws within Kohut.  She attacks them head on, unlocking this characters inner most secrets and exposing her full frontal for the world to see.  With a performance that includes self mutilation, public urination, proposed incest, total humiliation and twisted perversions of the unmentionable kind, Huppert never flinches in her delivery.  What is even better is that she accompanies each scene with the needed emotional connection to make it wholly believable.  Watching the coldness melt off her face as she faces rejection from the one she has bared her soul too, it is unbelievably sympathetic.  For a woman who has been so rigid and so evil (enough to viciously attack a student) we feel an honest sense of connection to her in that state of turmoil.

Huppert is accompanied by some great supporting players, not the least of which is Benoit Magimel, who stuns as her lover Walter.  Witnessing his initial admiration for Erika dissipate into a hysterical observation and then completely manic obsession is brutal and nerve-racking.  Annie Girardot is wickedly amusing as Erika's mother, a woman who is at the center of her daughters own collapse.

In the end, `La Pianiste' is NOT a film for everyone, but it is a film that will provoke you and stir you enough to validate its existence.  Michael Haneke is not a shy director, and he does not create fluff films.  His films are meant to be analyzed, studied and discussed.  If you are looking for a film that will challenge you, then this is a film you should witness.",1276646400,,5111,4.752834467120182

1633938,4,B00005NFL5,"Haneke captains another efficacious look into the human psyche with this compelling drama. His vessel of choice this time around is Isabelle Huppert and his voyage takes us far out into unchartered waters where most other captains fear to sail. Haneke leaves port and allows the passengers to gain understanding and appreciation for his vessel. She is small yet highly respected amongst her peers. Despite being built under assumingly harsh conditions her exterior is tough and she is built for the icy waters she frequents. Once our captain has sufficiently displayed the outer of his vessel and gained our respect, he then takes us below deck for a rare exhibit of the ship's viscera. What we see is distressing and unpleasant, however Hanke's ship has sailed and we are now headed for turbulent waters.

Huppert gives a brilliant performance as the piano teacher. She beautifully executes both the character's controlled exterior as well as her hauntingly troublesome interior. Haneke's direction is focused and he delivers an unyielding character study that's potent and believable. This voyage is not for the weak of heart. Many will find the subject matter disturbing, and rightfully so, but it would be difficult to deny this masterfully created film the merit it deserves. I almost rated this film five stars instead of four, but I have difficultly giving the highest marks to a film I never plan to see a second time.",1244764800,,1426,5.0423728813559325
1633939,2,B00005NFL5,"A cold, emotionally-repressed piano teacher under the thumb of a domineering mother finds release in a variety of inappropriate, unhealthy ways, including peeping into the car window of a young couple being intimate at a drive-in movie and smelling dirty tissues from the trash can of a porn shop video booth.  Apologies for being so graphic, but potential viewers should be alerted about what they're getting here.  Eventually, the teacher's actions escalate from the inappropriate and mildly criminal activities described to psychotic episodes including the maiming of one of her students.

To be fair, the movie is well acted, somewhat interesting, and never becomes boring (the worst sin of a creative work, in my opinion), but in the end the unpleasantness, grossness and endless depressing scenes outweigh the artistic value of the piece, making the film an ordeal to finish.  Obviously, other reviewers here on Amazon feel differently, but this is my take.  And, if you check out my other reviews, you'll see that I don't need a film to be light and feel-good to enjoy it.

There's a twenty-minute interview with actress Isabelle Huppert on the DVD, where she says that the crux of the film is the main character's desire to be loved in an old-fashioned way (""like something out of a nineteenth century novel"") in a world where men only want to seduce her.  ""Really?"" I said to myself, ""but how does that explain her desire to be tied up and beaten, as well as the premeditated criminal maiming of her student?""

1633941,1,B00005NFL5,"It's hard to say what this film is about. The plot has been repeated by others. In summary, the piano teacher follows her sexual fantasies down a path that leads to her destruction. It is as others have said a disturbing film, but for me this is not a compliment. There is little in the film worth taking away. The teacher herself is not especially interesting. She is abusive, mean-spirited, aggressive and destructive as a teacher. She maims one of her charges because the young girl dares to smile at the teacher's new sex toy, a young stud who has convinced himself, unconvincingly, that he loves his tyrant teacher. She is not just perverse; she is criminally insane. Her mother, who is every bit as sick and twisted, is a sexual voyeur and tormentor who exploits her daughter's bizarre sexual predilections which include porn shop cruising, drive-in movie peeping, and self-mutilation. Once she gets her hands on her new charge, she presents him in writing with a list of perverse demands. The handsome boy realizes that he is dealing with a sicko and runs for the hills. She stabs herself. I got little out of watching this mess. Who's to know what it all means or what the author intended. I came up with the idea that this ""World"" is meant to be ""Vienna,"" Europe's literal or symbolic music capital, a city of beautiful music and the birthplace of Hitler and the author, even though Paris has been used as the film's setting by the director. These two ""sides"" of Europe seem to coexist, according to the author, but we are given no hint as to what one is meant to do with this knowledge.",1221868800,8,1596,4.603508771929825

Most of you have probably read the synopsis already, so I'll just go on with my review. This film is either one of two things. Either it's a sorry excuse to torture the audience, or it is a richly textured character study of a woman who has some deeply rooted problems. I believe it's a bit of both - and I am no prude. I am always up for a challenging film, but there were times during The Piano Teacher where I just wanted to look away. I came close to cutting it off. However, I have set a strict rule for myself, in that the first time I watch a film, I watch it in it's entirety. I finished it, and I am glad that I did. There would have been no point in stopping it prematurely. The performances were excellent all around. Isabelle Huppert is totally and utterly convincing in what had to have been a difficult, exhausting role. Haneke's direction was amazing as well. The end was very powerful, and haunted me for a week.

1633946,4,B00005NFL5,"After I saw ""La Pianiste"" several years ago, I said to myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book ""The Piano Teacher"" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as ""Le Pianiste"". Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, ""soaked in the morbid humanity"", is another bright star of the movie.

I only have one problem with Haneke's vision.  There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character comparing to the novel.  In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.

The daughter is so damaged she cannot break away from her mother and at the same time is sexually repressed and turns to porno to relieve her repression.  But it really doesn't release her.  At times I felt like strangling that mother but that mother is so sick I felt ashamed at how I felt.

This film will stick with you, whether you like it or not and I'm not sure.  I watched it through until the end (which means I didn't hate it or I would have walked away).  Isabelle Huppert is magnificent (as she always is) and no one plays a repressed woman on the verge of eruption (see La Ceremonie).

1633949,5,B00005NFL5,"Nobel or no, it surprised me Jelinek's novel got made into a movie.  There is of course a filmable plot to the book, but its blunt narrative is so stylized, almost childish in its urgent impetus, and hounded all throughout with a foreboding sense of reader-voyeurism, that it seemed to me totally unfilmable or at least very difficult to reproduce on film.

And then I thought - of course, Haneke.  The master of cool intellectual voyeurism, done in a visually often flat but (for the viewer) psychologically harrowing way.  Plus, Huppert, the master of sangfroid surrender.  It could not be any more perfect.  Who else but these two to translate onto film the strange, disinterested yet intense tone of the book?!  Yet, curiously, the result is surprisingly a lot less like either Jelinek or Haneke.

For one thing, I've never seen his camera as romantic as it is here.  It's almost lyric, and although unblinking in its gaze on Erika, it also clearly pities her.  It shows her depravity, but it *sees* her as ill.  I found myself wondering why Haneke did this.  He could not have failed to see the book has far less pity than a slight contempt in its clinical scrutiny.  Nor could it quite have been the usual 'movie' reason of having to make its main character sympathetic enough to stay with -- at least not for the director of movies like 'The Seventh Continent.'

These aren't complaints.  I have no complaints against this movie.  But it should be said that even if Haneke isn't interested in a transparent novel-to-film transfer, it's not as obvious in its being a 'Haneke' film (again, not a complaint).

Huppert is excellent as a middle class piano teacher who on the outside is a rigid woman in control of her life as much as she is in control of her students, she demands perfection and accepts no excuses.  In her private life however, she is torn apart by contradictions.  Hupperts commentary in additional material sums it up perfectly, she is almost like a child.  Smothered by a mother who controls every aspect of her private life she resorts to what many would consider a 'perverse' private life.

She becomes the unwilling victim of the attractions of one of her students, a young man who has it all, well off family, friends and the social standing that means what he wants, he gets.

I don't teach in a conservatory, but do know that artists at that level can become very eccentric, and when they feel threatened, they can be vicious. Still, this film took that to the extreme and then some. Erika's relationship with her mother didn't make it any easier to achieve mental health, and her sexual fantansies and perversions drove her deeper into the abyss. By all outward appearances, she was a repressed, uptight bully with most of her students who went home to a quiet life with her equally repressed, bullying mother, but she often sneaked out at night to act out her fantasies. It's when an attractive student takes a romantic interest in her that she decides she can use him to act out her ultimate fantasies of being beaten and abused to an extreme. She controls him cruelly until he agrees to follow through. Some of this is hard to watch, but the film is never judemental, and Erika's humanity is always there.

You probably already know that it's about a sexually, uh...different...piano teacher portrayed by Isabelle Huppert with astonishing and heart-breaking power, and really, that's all you need at this point. Don't read the plot synopsis above, as it gives away absolutely everything--really, I think Amazon needs to take it down immediately.

Although this film might not be for everyone (particularly the squeamish or the faint of heart), it's an astonishingly powerful work of art. A lot of ""art"" movies are boring, perhaps because they are inaccessible; I can't think of anyone who could sit through this one bored. You can think about this movie on the surface or you can keep plumbing its thematic depths, to very worthwhile results. Aside from the obvious themes in the film, such as madness and sexual repression, the break between high art and popular culture, and sexual/romantic politics, I consider this an important feminist and even neomarxist film (insofar as the film is a criticism of capitalist society)--don't believe me? Google Adorno's essay ""The Culture Industry"" and see how closely his ideas are paralleled in the film. But this isn't just me being pretentious, Haneke has Erika drop Adorno's name in casual conversation in the second scene of the film; and of course, Elfriede Jelinek, Noble Prize in Literature winner in 2004 (a scandalous win that shook up the stuffy old academy) is a feminist writer, so we know to look for these themes. Other themes include: voyeurism (especially yours, the viewer...Haneke is definitely trying to punish you for your prurient search for titillation disguised as high art--we're all guilty of it!), parent-child relationships and stage parents, and on an intriguing level, the nature of love, and how it's perverted by capitalist society.

Sound like too much for one film? It's not! This one will profoundly shock you, leave you thinking about it for days. I've been thinking about it for months now, and only slowly did many of the ideas in the film become clear.

1633962,5,B00005NFL5,"If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality.  Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself.  Her outward expression projects her desire.  That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.

Along comes talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity.  He wants to become her student so as to be close to her.  She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in.  He falls in love with her.  Again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.

The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control?  The sadist or the masochist?  Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist?  It is hard to tell.  Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.

But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak.  She is a sex extreme freak.  She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability.  Actually that isn't even true.  She says she doesn't care what others think.  She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love.  Love, she calls it.  For her sex and love are one and the same.

At one point Walter tells her that love isn't everything.  How ironic such a superfluity is to her.  How gratuitous the comment.

The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within).  He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another.  This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone.  Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery.  We don't need to see any more.

The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them.  I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul.  Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense.  What matters to her is the performance and the challenge.  No part is too demanding.  No character too depraved.  It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does.  She is always fascinating and nearly flawless.  She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.

I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentellire) from 1977 when she was 22 years old.  There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser.  Her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician.  Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.

Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets.  (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.)  In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty.  Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La Crmonie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.

1633963,2,B00005NFL5,"I adored this movie in that it dispelled the simulacra of gracious living with classical music.  I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.

I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her.  I had difficulty making that leap.  I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.

I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film.  It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was.",1130716800,2,749,4.858267716535433
1633964,5,B00005NFL5,"The thema of the movie is that how far the man who is in love with a woman can be involved in her world, and also is that how far actors can be involved in their role.

I admire two leading actors, Isabell Huppert and Benoit Magimel, for thier courage to act these characters. They each got the best actoress and actor in Cannes 2002, they deserve it and should be given.

Erika, a main character and Huppert acted, had been a lack of sexial relationship with men then in a way she lost control of her desire outside school and home. However the movie reprensents it so directly then I can not get involved with. That is something I need to understand but I don't want to see.

Benoir Magimel, I became a fan of his by the movie, he is beautiful and attractive in the movie and that charm is even strange in his character. It is so strange a young attractive man fell in love with a woman like Erika and it takes so long time to realize and leave her.

The story tells us that it is fantasy love makes people strong and beautiful. Many of French movies represent this idea any way.

I don't recommend you to watch this movie, however if you want to challenge how far you can be involved as an audience with  realistic, do it, maybe that worth it.",1128643200,,1246,4.214285714285714
1633965,1,B00005NFL5,"Some of the negative reviews of this movie might be for the wrong reason.  Others don't quite articulate the reasoning well enough to be convincing.  Maybe I can help?

I like philosophy, deep movies, and the French language - so I was looking forward to a fantastic film with compelling new material.  Especially after reading how well it did at Cannes.  Roger Ebert even gave it a big ol' bunch of stars.

Unfortunately, the only interesting themes (which were hinted at only tangentially) in this movie were said by psychoanalysts 80 years ago and Jean-Paul Sartre 50 years ago.  Except the difference was that when those thinkers put their ideas out there, they did so in a compelling way that made sense of our innermost feelings and the world around us.  This movie fails miserably in this respect, filling up holes in content with the most over the top violence and sex I've ever seen.  I ended up watching the unrated version, which probably made the entire experience significantly worse than it would have otherwise been.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I get the feeling that people are rating this movie highly just because of the positive critical reception it got (Cannes, etc.).  The emperor's new clothes phenomenon, you know.  The acting is good - I can't imagine how challenging it must have been to play these roles.  But that's about all I can say for this movie.

1633969,5,B00005NFL5,"Elfriede Jelinek was occupied e.g. with Condoleezza Rice. The present American Foreign Minister in her Denver-childhood was pushed by her parents exactly the same way into the role of a classical Pianist, as Elfriede Jelinek in Vienna had to experience this sort of oppression at her own body. In her novel ""The Piano Player"" the winner of the Nobel-prize (Literature) brings up for discussion in a satirical, sarcastic, cynical, yes shameless way, which sort of soul-destructive dominance mothers in their four domestic walls can unfold, if they are out-pushed from the public job-career-life (still generally the superiority is the male preference). The mother of Elfiede Jelinek after 1945 led negotiations on reparation payments at Austria with Russia - until male persons (leaving the prisoner-of-war-camps, returned, recovered) pushed away female persons from political functions and other jobs. Jelinek converts those experiences in her novel, filled up with certain autobiographic patterns, and there are parallels to the American Condoleezza Rice (by the way ""Condi"" learned Russian to be able to participate effectively at disarmament negotiations between the USA and the Soviet Union ). A stylish seeker of word-using Elfriede Jelinek chose the form of the ice-cold satire, maybe the best way, to reach the necessary distance against things, which have hurt a person very deeply. Franz Kafka by the way wrote probably less based in depression and despair than acting out of a control room of a tremendously biting Jewish humor: The ability to understand this sort of language-use was lost nearly completely after the extinction of the Jewish culture under the Nazi rule in the German-speaking countries . Jelinek therefore assumes, she is understood really correctly neither by the enthusiastic praising price lenders nor by rageful-hateful raving province journalists. Perhaps by Condoleezza Rice, if she had enough time to analyse such novels - and movie-scripts. Madeleine Albright, the Prague fled Rice- and Colin Powell-predecessor in the minister-office of foreign affairs, she is friendly with Condoleezza Rice; the two women noticed the structural comparability of their trauma: Albright, threatened with death by the Nazis and later on bored by the communists, Rice, colored, threatened by the race hatred in the Ku-klux-klan-environment of the 1960-years in the US Southern States. Elfriede Jelinek felt threatened by her prevail-addicted mother. The education-atmosphere at home had been formed by the typical middle-class-aim, to climb up the social ledder, in order to ""make things better"". Mother Jelinek (and the Rice-parents) focused the education-energy on the only child (a procession not divided, because there are existing no brothers and sisters). Condoleezza Rice became not a pianist (the at-first-wish of her parents and herself) but a Foreign Minister with energy-loaded rage on woman-despising Islamic states, unmarried and equally irreconcilably bitingly as the Austrian writer. Jelinek already for a long time didn't practice on her costly Steinway piano, but she became a language-composing Nobel-prize-winner - vulnerable, fighting against a disputable group of austrian politicians, but retired, fearfully withdrawn living, nevertheless relatively consolidated by a husband and by her special sort of biting humor. Condoleezza Rice, sometimes nicknamed as the US-American ""war princess"" or ""Terminatrix"", maybe the world shoud hope, that a little bit more of austrian humor and ability to see things ironically will find a way into Condi's strategy. Based on such comparisons and knowledge backgrounds about curriculi vitae, opposing the education-atmospheres of these women, you maybe understand the ""Piano Player"" in a more sophisticated way ...",1122163200,2,3789,5.672535211267606

1633971,4,B00005NFL5,"A piano teacher superbly performed by Isabelle Huppert (one of my top favorite actress in the world), exhibits the ancient myth of Eros and Psiquis, and emerges with powerful force and dark poetry in this frustrated human being who, hidden on her art helmet, seems to watch how her best lifetime passed without any expectative. The cotidianity establishes in her life an unbearable repetition of a long catalogue of common places. Indeed, the obvious conclusion you perceive after she punishes that promising and talented pupil through the most miserable envy feeling and impotence. In her soul depths she knows her pupil will overpass her in a future not so distant.
But suddenly the passion appears and with it the Pandora Box will open with her cumulative sum of expected affection, sexual repressions and the wished love that came behind the masque of the oblivion.
She will play hard this role of victim and victimary. In her role of teacher the last profile is well known but she knows the time is brief and somehow as the famous Proust novel she intends to search desperately the missed time.
To be honest the camera is not to the same level than the performers. Huppert is overwhelming but the camera eye doesn't maintain the same level of required fierceness and mistakenly you can feel it. If you intend to change visual agression with the deepest insights of that troubled soul avid of love and consideration, we have big problem.
Think in Nagisa Oshima with the Empire Senses and you will realize that important device. The way you use your filmic language is even much more important perhaps tahn the same script if you want to accent certain issues to achieve your purpose.

1633972,5,B00005NFL5,"Many of the reviews have provided very good plot summaries, descriptions of major scenes, etc., but none have really given a good description of how this film makes you, as the viewer, feel.  This is a pity, because here we have a powerful film that leaves you unsettled and puzzled.  The main characters are far enough askew that you cannot identify with them, but real enough that you empathize.  Moreover, while it is easy to say that the sado-masochistic themes are what makes this film troubling, there are really many layers where we are stymied in our hope for resolution and explanation.

Clues are strewn throughout the story, bits of history that we latch on to in our quest to understand why this piano teacher is so cruel, why she withstands the abuses of her mother, why she mutilates herself.  The easy answers are unsatisfactory.  She abuses her mother as much as she is abused.  Her father went crazy, but was there something unspeakable in his past?  She is a perfectionist, but seems jealous of others.  Inevitably we attempt to use these clues to ""solve"" the puzzle, but our piano teacher always seems one step ahead in eluding us.  Further, this leave-a-clue/elude-resolution pattern continues through the final scene of the film, thus we cannot attempt to understand or explain it until after we have seen it in its entirety.  Watch this film with someone and you will spend hours discussing it in an attempt to understand it.  Usually, when my wife and I watch a film, we discuss how it fits in with other films, its potential importance and influence(s).  With this film our discussion never made it outside the film - we were trying to understand the characters.

This film changes the way you look at other people.  When we are introduced to the main characters,Erika Kohut and her student Walter Klemmer, we see characteristics that remind of of others we know.  Yet as we learn more about them, we are disturbed.  We don't like what we find when we cross from the public to the personal - and by extension we begin to wonder about those around us, even how we appear to others.  That we never resolve the characters, that we never figure out how to categorize and place them, exacerbates this disruption of our view of humanity.  The real and the surreal are so tightly woven in the characters that we lose confidence in our ability to discern.  We become a bit like Walter Klemmer who is clearly flailing in his attempt to regroup after his teacher reveals a bit of her ""real"" self.

While the film is disturbing, the shock comes from the characters, particularly Erika.  Her actions defy our sensibility, and while there are serious sexual overtones - if not plain sexual actions - in the film, everything is so much imbued with a sense of pain and emotional sickness that we are shocked rather than titillated.  Visually the film is beautiful, if a bit dark.  Sense of space, mood, and feeling change with ease.  This is a film that looks natural, rich, and vibrant.  The disjuncture between the public scenes and the private interior of the characters (again, primarily Erika, though Walter throws us a few curves) is part of what makes this film work so well.

1633974,5,B00005NFL5,"This movie is unusual from the beginning. I was so transfixed when I first saw it in the theater that I went back three more times. This is unlike you will see from an American studio. The French, it seems, display more bravado when dealing with controversial topics. The story centers around Erika (played magnificently by Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher still being treated like a 12-year-old by her mother(Annie Girardot). Erika seems to derive all of her satisfaction in life by means of a piano. When a younger man shows interest in her, she at first, rebuffs him. You get the impression that Erika has never been involved in a relationship with a man before. The problem is, the man,Walter,(also magnificently played by Benoit Magimel), doesn't know what he's getting himself into. The object of his desire performs masochistic experiments on herself, even to the point of drawing blood. (This scene is omitted in the R Rated version.) After Erika has her student attacked she and Walter proceed to have perhaps, the most unusual sex scene you are ever to see on film. The story unravels with her revelation that she wants him to beat her. The catch, ironically enough,is that she doesn't want to be beaten, she wants to be loved. Everything comes to a head at the when Walter beats and rapes her. The apparent moral of this is: don't say anything you don't absolutely mean. And perhaps, be careful what you wish for. Walter, himself, also says something he ultimately doesn't mean. I found the ending unexpected when I first saw it, and I don't want to give it away. You will have to see it for yourself. Isabelle Huppert's performance in this picture is haunting. You sense her character's cold exterior, while simultaneously, sensing her inner vulnerability. The classical music of Franz Schubert is expertly placed in this movie. And it's effect is obvious when you see it. Both co-stars spent a year perfecting the music. There is nothing false about their performances. There are a number of scenes in this movie that can turn your stomach. If you are looking for lighthearted fare you might want to look elsewhere. But if you are intrigued by something complex and daring, a movie that holds no punches, a movie that will have you talking about it after it is over, or if you appreciate first-rate acting, then I highly recommend this movie. It ranks at the very top of my list of favorites, and has made me into a lifelong devotee of Isabelle Huppert.

Huppert brilliantly realizes the portrayal of an emotionally twisted woman:  maniacally focused on her art, from a bizarre household she cannot escape, and unable to form loving relationships.  SHe is at times sad, cruel, and sexually experimental.  However, as a reflection of her loneliness and pain, there is nothing whatsoever titillating about her sexuality.

1633979,4,B00005NFL5,"""The Piano Teacher"" is the story of Erika Kohut (a once in a lifetime role, perfectly played by French actress, Isabelle Huppert) is a renowned piano professor at the Vienna Conservatory, a top-notch prestigious music school in Vienna.

 Erika, in her early forties and still painfully single, lives and even sleeps in the same bed with her vicious, overprotective and sadistic controlling mother (played aptly by Annie Girardot, however the part was initially offered to the fabulous Jeanne Moreau).

 Erika is a complex human being to say the least. Besides the fact that she is playing host to a many colored different lifestyle by acting as the ""man of the house"", Erika is utterly and deeply sexually repressed. When things in Erika's tiny, cloistered life get too horribly awful for her own self-expression and outpouring of feelings, she resorts to sexual self-mutilation, voyeurism, porn shops, and her own underworld of unspeakable acts on other human beings besides herself.

 Then... Erika meets Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a engineering student-cum-talented pianist who signs on to Erika's ""Master Class"" that she teaches at conservatory. Walter is struck by the singularly quiet but strong, Erika and he lets his feelings be known. However, Erika ""expresses"" herself in very ""different"" ways such as sexual sado-masochism and writes to Walter all the things that she longs for him to ""do"" to her, all the while, Erika treats Walter like less than a human as she does, most all the people and her own students in her sick, sad and twisted life.

 The irony of this story is that Erika can only truly express herself and her scant good, beautiful and natural feelings ""a priori""- in and through her music, but in really no other way. Her sick and twisted thoughts of man overpowering woman, rape, a sexual relationship with her own mother, self-mutilation, and general sadistic behavior overtake her and in the end... Well, watch and find out for yourself.

 Really, over and above it all, Erika's jealousy of other human beings who can and DO express their longings, fears, joys, and disappointments get to her in the end. When Erika is finally able to express her feelings and what it is she THINKS that she wants and desires in her sad half-human, base sort of way, she is rejected and thus the end to the tale is quite a sad one...

 This is probably the most sexually charged movie that I have viewed without any of the cast being the least bit naked. There is no quivering frontal flesh in this fabulous film, only frightful, frigid, fruitless feelings that will cut you to the bone...

1633980,5,B00005NFL5,"The Piano Teacher is a beautifully acted, wonderfully cinematic, and deeply disturbing masterpiece. It is quite unlike any other motion picture experience I have ever had.
Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress and she absolutely shines in her role as a psychotic piano teacher who can't get what she wants, so goes out to ruin the life of others. The movie reveals this slowly and beautifully. I was impressed that there was no attempt at pop psychology or mediocre explanations that you would expect in a Hollywood melodrama with similar subject matter. The film is done in a simple, elegant, and gut-wrentching style, sure to fascinate and disturb, even if the film is hated in the end. Also worth mentioning is that Hubert's troubled but sympathetic character lives with her mother, in what has to be one of the most chilling mother/child relationships since PSYCHO.
This is an exceptional film, thought-provoking, powerful, and strangely moving. It is not for those who can't face the dark side of human nature. It's far from being a life affirming ""feel good"" movie; it's a movie that is difficult to watch and raises plenty of questions. If the difficult subject matter of 'Irreversible' interested you, then this is your kind of movie. I enjoyed it immensely, as uncomfortable as I was watching it, and consider it a worthwhile, rewarding experience.
The film has a haunting and disturbing finale, and is not always easy to digest, and therefore, it is not for all tastes. For fans of French or art-house cinema, this is definitely your cup of tea.

The overall effects are quite convincing. It's defintely shocking and at least commercially this film is a success.
The choice of Schubert's music at least serves two points. First, Schubert's music is one of the saddest in the history of music, it's the music of the loniest pilgrim. Second, contrary to Beethoven's music, which is so clear and straight forward, the change of moods in Schubert's music is so sudden and so abundant and that it is often difficult to follow, so are the turns and twists in this story.
A general survey of the life of the pianists would making this story more convincing. An American critized Kissin for knowing nothing but playing on the piano from day to night all his life; Glenn gould shut himself up in front of the piano since or before his pre-teens; Allica de Larrocha's mother begged her daughter to ""live her life"" (Allica's word), instead of sacrifying it to the piano; MargaretArgerich's ""fiance"" (Margaret's own word) was the piano... The life of a musician destined to become a concert pianist could be very lonely ( and boring )to the point of abnormality unless you really love it, or unless you can balance it with sufficient chamber music or the like. Yet, competition is so keen that 99 concert pianists out of a hundred would advise against a cereer of a concert pianist unless he is exceptionally talented.
Obviously the heroine here, despite her sacrifice, didn't make it as a concert pianist. Her mother, so possessive and dominating, openly urged her to earn more money in order to buy a flat. Furthermore, the family has a history of mental problem; and her mother sharing the bed with her even when she was forty something... Needless to say, this case is by no means a norm yet it is not at all unconvincing.
What is controversial though is the deliberate distortion of the sound of all music, be it's piano or vocal music, so that there is NO MUSIC LEFT AT ALL. Perhaps this serves the main theme of the story better, delivering a greater impact upon the audience. And yet on the other hand, one also wonders if that is really necessary, whether a mix of bitteress & sweetness would be more impressing.",1087171200,4,2333,4.706601466992665

A general survey of the life of the pianists would making this story more convincing. An American critized Kissin for knowing nothing but playing on the piano from day to night all his life; Glenn Gould shut himself up in front of the piano since and before his pre-teens; Allica de Larrocha's mother begged her daughter to ""live her life"" (Allica's word), instead of sacrifying it to the piano; MargaretvArgerich's ""fiance"" (Margaret's own word) was the piano. The life of a musician destined to become a concert pianist could be very lonely ( and boring )to the point of abnormality unless you really enjoy it, or unless you can balance it with sufficient chamber music or the like. Yet, competition is so keen that 99 concert pianists out of a hundred would advise against a cereer of a concert pianist unless one is exceptionally talented.

Obviously the heroine here as ""a piano teacher"", despite her sacrifice, didn't quite make it as a concert pianist. Her mother, so possessive and dominating, furiously urged her to earn more money to buy a flat etc. Furthermore, the family has a history of mental problem; and her mother sharing the bed with her even when she was forty something. Needless to say, this case is by no means a norm yet it is not at all unconvincing. And having been to the concert hall where this film was shot, it appears to me strikingly sad and true.

What is controversial though is the deliberate distortion of the sound of all music, be it's piano or vocal music, so that there is NO MUSIC LEFT AT ALL, ONLY NOISES. Perhaps this serves the main theme of the story better, delivering a greater impact upon the audience. And yet on the other hand, one also wonders if that is really necessary, whether a mix of bitteress & sweetness would be more impressing.",1086998400,,2485,4.692660550458716
1633983,3,B00005NFL5,"I like dark movies. This movie. Is a dark movie. I may have given the review just 3 stars but it is only for the many, many questions I had at the end of the film. The one thing I have trouble understanding is the true reason of why the piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert) is the way she is. You can say out of nowhere, oh she was molested or raped when she was young or something but the movie never ever shows any flashbacks or reveal any true thoughts or opinions of her nature from her own point of view. The good job done by this movie is making the viewer a 'voyeur' into this woman's situation as she struggles with a man and her own mother. Another good reason why I liked the film is because of the ending. I just remember feeling so cold and depressed from the ending becuase it was something that I did not expect to happen at all. Personally this movie gave me a jilt and if your into ever watching foreign films than I recommend The Piano Teacher.",1076803200,2,957,4.150537634408602
1633984,2,B00005NFL5,"Being a fan of Isabelle Huppert's work, I expected something more from this film. The only good thing about this film, as a matter of fact, was Huppert's performance of a woman coming undone. She lives her relatively closed (and closely monitored by her live-in mother) life as a piano teacher, and everything seems stern, put together (except for this bizarre relationship with her mother, who controls everything). And then Huppert's much-younger student begins to pursue her. By the time Huppert succumbs, she is unraveling. At the same time, the movie unravels with her.",1075161600,4,574,5.117021276595745
1633985,5,B00005NFL5,"Forget about reading into any meaning that you think this film may offer. The director is known as just a person who likes to mess with your brains. Anyone who has seen his previous works will snap this one up in an instant. Those who enjoy this movie will likely try his other fine beverages for the head.
Basically the protagonist, a sexually insane music teacher, is as mad as bag of hammers yet manages to stay somewhat somber in her profession because she fits in with the rest of the snobs, but deep inside she is totally and completely bananas with a surreal sized suppressed sexual appetite to boot. So she walks the music halls with his lemon sucking expression among all the other lemon suckers who are sucking their lemons for very different reasons to hers and for this reason nobody really knows who or what she is like.
When a music student falls head over heels in love with her they set out on a voyage of absolute debauchery in every nock and cranny that they can do it in. However his love of her is totally blind to her madness. He perceives her sadomasochism as an extension of her frustration when in fact that it just another major part of her psychosis. As they delve around with each other (sometimes very violently) the viewer begins to understand that this is really just a very sick woman who needs treatment fast and yet the world she works in and her lover can not identify it. In fact many viewers will fail to grasp that the main character is crazy until the very last scene which drives the message home like a knife to the heart.
This is great art-house cinema and as an insane movie ranks up there with the best of them. Some of the [] scenes are very close to X-rated material and certainly many viewers will be put off by that and the heavy amounts of violence that are sometimes on display. In short, this is a great movie about insanity, love and professionalism rolled into one. The characters in this movie are unique and the film is certainly deserving of the acclaim it received.

1633986,1,B00005NFL5,"This film is simply boring, as are perversions, fixations and all that stuff that in general interests solely psychoanalists,and that just because they get paid to listen to such idiotic craziness. Huppert is OK in this horrid movie, nevertheless I would not save her from the blast. All you will get is annoyed from watching this, it allows no day-after thoughts, it does not linger on within you, as nothing in the movie actually is transcending in any conceivable way.
This film is about a pianist who happens to have hell for a home. Continuing the metaphor, the musician's mother is a she-devil kind of thing. To be fair to, well, the devil devil, who's most likely a guy, the pianist's mother is no more than a crippled old lady who has raised her child in an incestuous fashion, thus promoting the multiple sexual nightmarish deeds this woman, as an adult, would engage in. Along with that, the lack of love she ""suffers from"" proves to be the same rejection and hatred she actually demands in others and, accordingly, delivers to everyone surrounding her.
This film is like a classical videoclip. While we enjoy some Schumann tunes we see the piano teacher wrapping herself in acts of extreme cruelty, sex that is far from enjoyable to any average individual, over the edge irrational unbuyable conversation with her mother, the pursual of something more love-like in a younger person (that is, mostly being despised and having a kick out of it). To decidedly ruin the movie is the ending, which stands as one of the worst I have ever undergone.
This film has no story line, it does not reach out to the viewer, in it there is no landmark aesthetics of any sort, no revolt against anything, no adherence to anything. It is nonesense poured  into allegedly disturbing images, but why would any creator do that? Just for the sake of filming sickening stuff. That is easy to do. Tape a dog dying or a mother crying the loss of her child and you are there. But what for? And, is it cinema?

anyway, upon learning what ms. huppert had to say (in the extras) i was puzzled by her obliquely appropriating this work in the name of feminism--the director's opinion on this is sorely absent.
i consider this movie makes an artistic point about what takes place at the near-intersection of woman's pathology with mundane masculinity. the main characters, polarized with such charges, fiercely exhaust each other in a unique orbit (i.e. attraction & repulsion.) they do so much onto each other yet there are the unintended consequences that they live and die by and not their prior projections.
it is also worth noticing how MUSIC catalyzes everything up to the point where the orbiting gets dangerous; then it stops. music is all they share, everything else is just a succession of opposite positions the characters take along identical dimenssions.

1633989,2,B00005NFL5,"Hardly. Erika (Isabelle Huppert) is one of the highest regarded and sought after classical piano instructors around. She's held in very high esteem at the conservatory where she teaches. She holds private lessons and does recitals. She's prim, proper and brutally strict with her students. She also cruises porno shops, watches the porn videos (graphically displayed and the only skin in this film) and peeps in lovers' parked cars at the drive-in where she gets so turned on she urinates. She also cuts her vagina with a razor when frustrated. She lives with her aged harridan mother (Annie Girardot) who pushes her daughter to achieve so hard that it results in mama bashing. Then along comes stud-puppy/jock/wanna-be piano whiz Walter (Benoit Magimel) who starts hitting on Erika right and left until she caves in (in a bathroom) and reveals her inability to have normal sex which frustrates the heck out of Walter. But he professes to love her and agrees to whatever she wants. Sort of. She writes a letter telling him what she wants. The utter degradation she desires in that letter made me wonder, dear Lord---how many ""dark sides"" does this woman have? She wants to be tied up, slapped around, beaten, sexually humiliated, gagged---the list goes on and on. Walter is repulsed. No dice, Erika. She follows him and begs for his forgiveness and then promptly throws up when he complies to her demands for impromptu oral sex. He throws her out in disgust. Then he comes begging back in the middle of the night, claiming she's bewitched his brain with her ""sickness"". He locks Mama in the bedroom, brutally beats and kicks Erika and rapes her. He says in effect, ""Isn't this what you wanted?"" What a cad. He even gets away with it. But the ending is what really threw me. I felt like I was the one needing a good slap. The performances in this film are excellent. Especially Huppert. But I can't believe she let the director get away with that ending. It just left me empty and mad that I watched it. The character of Walter is disgusting. Erika is no less pathetic---she's extremely sick and even puts broken glass in a promising but scared student's coat pocket so she'll slice up her hand and can't play. And gets away with it!  I don't know who I could recommend this film to. It's played so dreadfully serious---even the scene where Erika tries to have sex with her mother.

The movie is a testament to Huppert's versatility.  The movie goes far beyond any American movie in its character's relvelations of her lonely and suppressed nature.  I cannot imagine any other actress putting herself through the scenes that Huppert, a consumate actress, played with incredible skill.

1633991,5,B00005NFL5,"The Piano Teacher shows us a few days in the life of a disturbed woman who is both victim and victimizer.  Isabelle Huppert briliantly plays the part of Erika Kohut, a middle-aged piano teacher at a music college in Vienna.  Annie Giradot is no less effective as her domineering and watchful mother.  The two women abuse one another physically and verbally.  This relationship is long standing and comes to a crisis as the film progresses.
Erika is unable to break the bonds that attach her to her mother.  Instead, like a child who has never grown up, she wants to please her mother, but is driven to act out her own fantasies secretly.  Her mother appears to be unaware of the deep seated repression that is consuming her daughter.  What she does see is an angry, hateful person who lies to her and deceives her frequently.
Erika's sexual frustration takes the form of physical and pschological self-hate.  She visits porn shops to degrade herself and she mutilates her body to distract her from the intense psychological pain she suffers constantly.
At school her anger takes the form of verbal abuse to her students who are unable to achieve the artistic integrity she demands.  What appears to be an inflated sense of her own importance as an artist masks her frustration at being second-rate.  She is not good enough to be recognized as an artist in her own right.  Her hatred of herself and her inadequacy as an artist prompt her to strike out at students and colleagues alike.
Into her seething cauldron of despair comes a young engineering student, Walter Klemmer, wonderfully played by Benoit Maginel, who wants to study Schubert with her.  At first she refuses him, but pressure by the school to accept him forces her to work with him.  The sexual tension between teacher and pupil is immediately apparent and moves forward to a collision some reviewers have likened to a bad car accident.
In the end we see Erika and her student reduced to the lowest common demoninator as human beings.  At first Erika is successful at dominating her young student, but the tables are turned as she becomes dependent on him.  Both teacher and student are playing a zero sum game to lose.  The final climax and its denoument leave Erika a wounded, broken woman.
The director, Michael Haneke, elicits finely tuned performances by all the players, particularly Huppert, who is magnificent in the title role.  Haneke has made this film for adults only.  It is dark and disturbing from beginning to end with moments of pain and violence that are as real as anything one is likely to see on the screen.
Huppert as the piano teacher has no redeeming qualities we are able to see in the short space of time covered by the film.  Viewers looking for a pleasant and agreeable entertainment are urged to search elsewhere.  Haneke shows us a dark side of life and he is unflinching in its portrayal.",1058832000,119,2883,4.728

I can't say I 'enjoyed' watching this film, but I would give it the highest recommendation on every level because of the masterly performances of all involved.

You will have seen words like, dark, brooding, disturbing thrown around like confetti, when in truth the movie simply does not deliver. What leaves an sour taste in the mouth is not the disturbed main character, nor the semi graphic sexual scenes, but mainly a very very compelling film that ends abruptly, if not predictably leaving the viewer feeling cheated. Is it well made? yes - well acted? sure - but like so many of these ""critically acclaimed"" dramas it's missing one vital thing.

I don't agree at all with the reviewers who found the movie pretentious or boring.  It is absolutely riveting and dark, but you have to wonder what you are viewing, what is being said about women (even if the novel the film is based on was written by a woman), and why such a subject has to be told in such a graphic way.  It seems that if something absolutely repulsive is created in an artistic way people are eager to praise it or risk being labeled anti-intellectual.  I saw the rated R version and had to turn away and even fast forward the scene involving the violent confrontation.  Anyone who can view what looks like rape to me and call out ""brilliant!"" or ""artistic masterpiece!"" is too twisted for my taste.  This is not a film for a seeker of beauty or anyone with a sensitive heart.  Even if you love drama and tragedy, as I do, this work is in a category all its own.

You are probably either going to *love* it, or you are going to LOATHE it. There is really no middle ground.
So which will it be, for you?
If you like your films easy and with Arnold Schwarzenegger in, you will almost undoubtedly loathe it. If you come from some rural backwater and believe in that whole ""christian"" thing, the same applies. If you have heard that this film is ""dirty"" and has ""sex in it"" you will probably feel deeply ripped off.
If on the other hand, you know that Hollywood has only produced four or five films worth a damn in the last ten years, and have turned your attentions to the films of the rest of the world, you will be in for a serious treat. ""The Piano Teacher"" is a real film, about real people, and real human relationships and as such it is neither simplistic or particularly easy to watch.
If you like films that make you think and draw a deep emotional response, you will like this film. If you like the idea of a lloooonnng argument or acrimonious discussion after a film, ""The Piano Teacher"" is definitely one to watch. It *really* stirs the pot.
A brilliant film, but one that some people find very difficult to deal with. Check out some of the commentaries on this film on the web, just search for ""Piano Teacher meaning"" on Google.

Heineke's film, is definitely one of the biggest rises in French film industry. And I agree with the other reviewers, that the film's unknownness is directly related to its unconventional tension, which literally made me scratch my seat in the theater.
The film focuses on Isabelle Huppert's sexual and social psychosis, and her isolation from the rest of the society. During the course of the movie, Huppert goes through a couple of sexual explosions, which are not at a pleasing nor satisfying level at all, but rather resulting in discontent and hatred among her and her partner, who is the student she gives piano lessons to. This after-scene suffices for you to feel odd. Her sexual inmaturity, gives rise to her weird behavior during daily life. Her seclusion of her own mother, that precedes her real harrassment of her, is a good example of this idea.
This film involves severe tension, sexual and social violence. Beware of this fact before you purchase the film. It's a brilliant film, but for some people. Some may not like the content. Great production by Heineke, great acting by Isabelle Hupport!",1052092800,10,1287,4.8545454545454545

1633998,5,B00005NFL5,"When I first heard about Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher"", about a sexually repressed instructor at the Vienna Conservatory, I thought it was exactly the kind of movie I didn't want to see.  In a world awash in pop music, South Park and Britney videos, how could a film about the stultifyingly uptight classical music world have *any* relevance for a post-modern, post-everything film buff (even if he is American?)  Didn't Bergman tread this ground 40 years ago?  Didn't Bunuel make savage fun of the hypocrisy of bourgeois sexual  respectability in ""Belle de Jour"" (1966)?  Wasn't Haneke a little behind the times?
Walking - or I should say staggering - out of the theater 2.5 hours later, I was humbled by the scope of Haneke's and Huppert's achievement.  Rarely have I seen a film both so clear-eyed about sexual psychosis and yet so compassionate as well.  Isabelle Huppert, who probably wasn't nominated for an Oscar only because the film can be so off-putting to some, gives what can only be described as an intense performance.  Her clenched face and the darting movements of her eyes reveal more about her character - her inner rage, her self-hatred - than most actors can achieve with sheets and sheets of dialouge.  That's the essence of the film, everything is very formally *controlled* - so that when violence, self-inflicted or otherwise, breaks out, it is startling because it emerges from such as civilized veneer.
If the point of the film were to demonstrate the High Culture spiritually deforms those who engage in it (and I don't think it does), the film would have minimal interest.  High culture has been on the defensive so long, it doesn't need to be blamed for driving Isabelle Huppert nuts as well.  Rather the film gains its strength from watching a seriously damaged human being - damaged in ways only suggested at - construct a protective cocoon around herself that fails to protect her from troublesome feelings and desires.  The film is somewhat similar to Neil Jordan's great film, ""The Butcher Boy"" whose protagonist uses an opposite strategy - relentless good cheer -to mask the absolute misery he's sinking into.  In these two films, as well as other recent films like Noe's ""I Stand Alone"", Nyutten's ""L'Humanite"", Haneke's other recent film ""Code: Unknown"" and Tim Roth's ""The War Room"", European filmmakers are portraying contemporary Europe as a society rife with cultural and psychological malaise - along with a great uncertainty as to ability of others to ameliorate the misery that man hands to his fellow man.
""The Piano Teacher"" is important - essential even - not because Isabelle Huppert is asked to do things on camera few major actresses would willingly agree to.  The film gets right to the dark heart of our contemporary malaise - our declining faith in the ability of culture - or anything - to ease us out of our despair and mitigate the cruelty we often see around us.  The film is extremely distributing, enraging but not empty - it was the most provocative piece of cinema to be release in the US last year.",1050278400,148,3067,4.859884836852207
1634009,1,B00005NFL5,"Despite the praise heaped on this movie, it is awful. The acting that is so ballyhooed involves lots of tense, pursed lip movements, shot in long stills with a piano playing in the background. The piano playing is really irrelevant to the plot (though of course the movie pretends otherwise). There is a lot of sick violence towards the viewer, in the form of unnecessary and crass depications of supposedly shocking and or titillating sick violence. It's a poorly conceived story bolstered by unconvincing and cheaply theatrical psychology.
This is the sort of movie that shows rather than reveals. In one of the most pretentious scenes, the main character assaults her mother, with whom she shares a bed, in an almost sexual way, and this is supposed to symbolize some emotional cataclysm that is otherwise undeveloped in the movie. The central love story is thrown at the viewer, and the sources of the central character's depraved violence against self and others are suggested only in an incoherent way.
This movie exemplifies what happens when a weak director tackles a complicated subject. This is not a character study, as some claim, as the main character is nothing more interesting than a fastidious and vicious psychopath. The male lead is a handsome but unexpressive face, who does an alright job of playing an obnoxious violent man hiding beneath a veneer of culture (this role might have had some interest, had it been developed).

Lo, they have turned this movie into a decent sized hit as a result. THE PIANO TEACHER is actually the best SPCS publicized movie I've seen to date. Brilliantly directed by Michael Heneke, who scripted from Elfiede Jelinek's novel. Huppert plays Professor Erika Kohut; a cold, brutal, seemingly prudent piano teacher at a prestious music academy. But behind her icy facade lies an obsession with pornography and sadomasochistic sex. When a gifted young piano student (Benoit Magimel) comes under Erika's tutelage, he doesn't play to her impossibly high standards and as a result bears the brunt of her wrath but he soon finds himself falling in love with the professor who just seems to enjoy playing mind games with him. Though unknown to him Erika is gradually losing control under the influence of her domineering mother.
THE PIANO TEACHER is exceptionally well photographed with a complex structure and a brilliant perfomance from Huppert (In fact you easily forget she IS just an actress playing a part).There are some rather grim scenes including plenty of S&M, a funny drive-in theatre peeing scene and Erika putting broken glass in a girls coat pocket. I'm not sure if this will get a DVD release in NZ, but it deserves to. THE PIANO TEACHER is a masterwork that commands a wide audience, and it was probably only because of its content that it was overlooked by the Academy.

1634011,5,B00005NFL5,"This film is so stunning and indescribable! I have never known such joy and excitement watching a new release!
Isabelle Huppert is playing one of her best roles here. She is undeniably the best actress in the world.
You just need to look at her face in this film to comprehend that. Yes, she never plays the role: she is the character, she lives the character, she feels the character.
She is deeply moving in this role. A cold, reserved, distant woman, yet so vulnerable, so tormented!
The contrast between her face and her emotions is amazing, fascinating.
Loneliness, despair, madness, anger, fear, pain, uncertainty, sadness...
Her cruelty and indifference are amazing when she makes her students suffer, and her vulnerability and puerility are even more striking when it's her turn to suffer.
The best scene takes place in her bedroom, when she locks herself up with her beloved, handsome student, ignoring her poor mother who is spying outside.
She forces him to read a long letter, a letter that she has written and given him earlier, after the piano lesson.
The absurd thing is that she insists on hearing the letter read to her, in which she describes what she expects him to do to her, in full details.
What a more horrible thing to request from a young man you love!
First, he seems embarrassed, surprised, amused. He reads it mockingly as she watches his face inquisitively, intensely, like a child hearing a story for the first time.
He cannot believe what he's reading, the innocent young student.
No, he refuses to believe her sickening requests. She wants him to humiliate her, to degrade her, to be cruel, to torture, to hurt, strike, rape.
He cannot believe it. No, no, his beautiful and respectful teacher would not want such a thing. Besides, he loves her too much to hurt her. He shakes his head, bewildered. To prove that she is not joking, she pulls out her 'torture' tools from under her bed. She shows them to him, proudly and naively, and assures him she is serious.
As he reads further, he is shocked, angry, disappointed, disgusted, and walks out of her apartment rapidly.
Although there is no violence nor sex in this scene, the impact is heartbreaking, and leaves you breathless.
The absurdity, the tension, the intimacy, the gaze, the provocation, allow you to imagine what might happen to her if he obeys her order, something even more frightening, more sadistic, more violent, more erotic, more painful, than the reality itself.
It's based on the controversial novel by Elfriede Jelinek, an Austrian writer. The book is even more powerful than the film. If you love the film, you absolutely have to read the book. It's like seeing the film again, and still, the impact is tremendous. There's more in-depth analysis of the characters with a striking style from the author.
The philosophical and psychological observations, the wild images are so detailed, so vivid, so absurd, so sarcastic that they make you cry and laugh at the same time.
It is a passionate book and a frightening one. All the strongest emotions are in here, with beautiful classical piano for music lovers.
Classical music lovers might not agree on the beauty of this book. Classical music is supposed to elevate our mortal souls, isn't it? But here it degrades the musician's soul. How can we tolerate such a thing?
Yes, it degrades here, but it's how reality is. Classical music creates the strongest human emotions, and why not torment, suffering, degradation, the passion and pleasure of hurting and being hurt?",1049068800,4,3517,4.853577371048253
1634012,5,B00005NFL5,"""The Piano Teacher"" is one of the most affecting films I've seen in a long time.  It is spare and cruel, and really has no resolution which often drives moviegoers crazy; I thought it was masterful.  I saw it over a week ago and I'm still thinking about it, which speaks to how powerful it is.  I won't go into plot details - you should see it yourself!  But I found none of its explicitness gratuitous in the least.  I thought it was a very honest portrait of the pain and anger of an individual.  I wouldn't really say it was about sadomasochism, because I think it's much deeper than that.  It's exposing, in a painfully raw way, the torment of a particular person.  I imagine this film will resound with two kinds of people - cinephiles focused on the artistry of the film and those who identify, on a personal level, with pain.  For those, Isabelle Huppert expresses more truth in the movement of an eyebrow than in just about anything else I've seen.  If you know what you're getting into, ""The Piano Teacher"" can be an amazing experience.",1047945600,4,1045,4.4526315789473685

1634014,4,B00005NFL5,"The boundaries of love and despair have possibly never been granted so desperate a stage as the slowly weakening lines on the ever-beautiful face of Isabelle Huppert in THE PIANO TEACHER.
Erika (Huppert) is a middle-aged piano teacher who spends her existence vascillating between torturous control over the lives of child geniuses and the smothering watchfulness of an aging, dispassionate mother.  However, when a young piano-playing engineer (Benoit Magimel) enters her life with his young mind on his lusty attraction, Erika's life begins to unravel.  Trying to maintain control, she continues to seek ways to express her innermost feelings without surrendering to the power of emotion -- having been trapped in an emotionless existence for so long.  Eventually, she cracks under the stress of her two worlds colliding, with equal parts psychological danger and the allure of eroticism.
Two haunting performances (Huppert and Magimel) make this story as captivating as it is disturbing.  In the end, both characters are forever changed, unable to return to the solace of the world they knew before and unwilling to sacrifice their outer shells for inner peace.
Not for the squeamish, THE PIANO TEACHER is highly recommended.",1046304000,4,1228,5.347150259067358
1634015,2,B00005NFL5,"Ok, first, I like foreign movies, and I especially like French foreign films. They just have a different way of doing things, cinematography etc...  But this film was really really bad.
There really is no character development, you are just to take these vapid characters with extreme problems at face value. The main charcter is a piano teacher with deviant sexual eccentricities, and thats putting it lightly.  Follow her through this film while she tries to make everyone and everything that she touches as sad and lonely as she is. She's a mean woman and it's just not entertaining to watch her spy on young lovers at the drive in, and then urinate next to their car while shes in sexual climax, nor is it interesting to watch her sabotage the young career of one of her students by putting crushed glass in her coat pocket. The only up side to this film is the romantic tendencies of her persuer who, for reasons unknown, is attracted to this woman at any cost.
She's a nasty woman with serious problems.
This film does not resolve a conflict, it abruptly ends.
I would not recommend this film to anyone.",1044835200,14,1109,4.624365482233503

I realized that a horror movie does not always need killers or vampires. This movie really scared me with its distastefulness. Nevertheless, it made  me keep watching till the end, probably because of the superb performance of the actors/actresses. But in the end, I had to say, ""Ew! Yuck!"". And I was fortunate that I watched R-rated version.
The only good thing is that this movie showed some of my favorite  pieces such as Schubert's Piano Trio in Eb Op 100 and Brahms's Sextet in Bb.
There are movies which you wish you had not watched, because it's sick and disturbing. The movies like Mulholland Drive make you watch one more time even though they are clueless in the first view. This movie is also clueless but I just can't watch it again. I regret that I rented this movie.",1042329600,8,1014,4.596685082872928

In this movie we find our single 30'ish piano teacher extraordinaire living with her mother in modern day Paris with her domineering mother ..... Since both of them sleep together, in an apartment that we find does have more than one bedroom, the viewer is on more than one accasion treated to observe a violent and disturbing relationship between mother and daughter from the get go ...
To say that our heroine sufferes from sexual repression pushing her to madness we see perversion come to the light of day when she is openly courted by one of her younger students who could have practically any girl his own age for the sheer asking ..... The students admission of love for his teacher forces her to face up to her repressed sexual urges and fetishes, which, in turn are initially rebuffed as madness .....
Although we hope that this young woman would be able to overcome her obsessions there is always a feeling within the viewers mind that this tragedy will not end well.....

At a private recital she meets a young vigorous man, Walter Klemmer, who plays the piano in a most seductive manner for her.  She attempts to keep distance from the young piano player in various ways.  However, he applies to the Vienna conservatory in order to be her student.  This makes it tremendously difficult for her, since she seems to be terrified of being hurt by Walter's seductive manners.  However, their fate is sealed as it is presented in an eccentric and neurotic manner.  The Piano Teacher portraits characters with meticulous detail, which elevates the film experience to a superior event.",1041984000,6,791,5.0
1634030,5,B00005NFL5,"This is a breakthrough movie--but not one that you should undertake watching lightly. The word ""harrowing"" best describes this descent into hell.
If you've never been in a battering relationship, you could never understand why someone would stay around and get beaten up day after day, this film will show you. The battering is mutual and invariably followed by bizarre moments of closeness, apology and even tenderness. In emotionally impoverished and dysfunctional families, this is as good as you get, so you go for it.
In this sensitive portrayal, the protagonist professor of piano technique, Erika, breaks though her deeply repressed sexuality and attempts to experience love for the first time with one of her students. Attempting to work out her internal conflicts, the love should be expressed alternately in sadism (she's gratuitously mean to all her students) or in masochism (what she demands of her lover is pain and humiliation). Since the object of her desire, Walter, is not only attracive and talented, but also seems to care deeply for her, the agony of this movie is much deeper.
As to the film itself, at times it moves slowly. But you need the break to recover from the intensity of the major scenes. The performances of piano and vocal music are paradoxically delightful to hear, and this movie should win an Oscar for ""best sound"" (every creak of a floor board counts).
This is a remarkable movie that should be taken seriously and will reward a mature approach.",1041984000,5,1485,4.967871485943775

All the acting in this movie is magnificent. Many of the american reviewers don't seem to understand the bigger picture, as if sexual violence is of a worse kind then plain killing with a gun and shooting people in the streets.

And the ending is a rather strained copout. Nevertheless, very interesting movie with some excellent acting.

1634033,3,B00005NFL5,"Isabelle Huppert is an amazing actress. Her rendering of persona in this film is quite remarkable. It only goes downhill after that. Though I would cautiously recommend this film to Huppert fans and Francophiles de Cinema.
The film deals in a prismatic way (not straightforward) with issues of self-abuse, incest, self-loathing, sexual deviance, rage, seduction and oddly enough, love.
Many questions are left unanswered, hence you must be the psychiatrist and discover the mysterious pathology behind all these behaviours (and you should know that they are not at all clear). If you like the type of film where you have to delve deep into the psychological trauma and gestalt of a character, then this film will leave you thinking and discussing and wondering for hours. Perhaps you will arrive at a diagnosis and many of the questions unanswered will find formulation.
Perhaps at that point the wonderful sets and beautiful acting will not have been for naught, that beneath the pain and excruciating scenes of deviance and humiliation will reveal something deeper about the human condition and our common existence. If you arrive at such a conclusion would you please write me and enlighten me as to this film's deeper meanings.
Also, it should be noted that this film is extremely explicit.

While the film is graphic at points, this helped me to understand the aforementioned behaviors.  I need to have a better understanding of children who cut themselves, girls that starve themselves, and teens who commit suicide.

1634035,1,B00005NFL5,"I have never written a review before, but I fear I could be held criminally liable if I did not warn anyone about to waste his money or her time on this movie, just as I would be if I knew that there was a bridge out up ahead and failed to warn oncoming traffic. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it makes one wonder whether or not it was made deliberately to goof on viewers and critics.
The plot, if it may be called that, is so creaky that a gallon of Three-in-One couldn't help it. Based on a psychological insight so ham-fisted that even a student in Psyc 101 would giggle, it takes about thirty seconds to determine the basic course of the movie. The main character spends her days brutalizing her students verbally and emotionally while secretly longing--are you ready for the surprise twist--to be physically brutalized in her turn by a lover, within earshot of her harpy of a mother no less. Enter the handsome young man, athlete, engineer, pianist, who is by turns repelled and attracted by the sado-masochistic fantasy, although why is anybody's guess, as one certainly doesn't get much of a clue from his dialogue or his actions. He also utters what has to be one of the funniest lines in the history of cinema during the rape scene, although rape may or may not be the correct word in this context. (And, admittedly, I do not speak French, so had to rely on the subtitles, but I don't think the translators would have gotten that particular line wrong and not any of the others.)
There is one group who will, no doubt, enjoy this film, Francophobes. They will find all of their worst stereotypes of and prejudices about the French resoundly re-affirmed: the snobbery, the pretentiousness, the sexual deviance, etc. About the only one missing is that we never see any of the main characters driving a car.
Someone, I can't remember who, once reviewed a book by saying that it was a book not to be put down lightly, but to be thrown with great force. I think that aptly sums up this film as well.",1038700800,7,2025,4.490514905149052
1634036,5,B00005NFL5,"Isabelle Huppert is in one great movie after another. A couple of years ago she played the mysterious and apparently selfless wife of a famus composer in Claude Chabrol's Merci Pour Le Chocolat. This time she plays a piano teacher in yet another role filled with subtlety and mystery. The role is in many ways reminiscent of the earlier one as Huppert reveals clues to her characters troubled psyche with odd and disturbing actions which offer a sharp contrast to her calm and collected exterior. She does much of her acting with the same expression which makes her one of the most interesting performers to watch for what she conceals with each performance is what fascinates and keeps us attentive. The performance Huppert gives as the piano teacher is a disturbing one for beneath her reserved exterior and her very high reputation seethe the passions of an unhappy woman. Whether her mother has caused her daughter to grow into the person she has become or not is perhaps a matter for debate. It appears the mother is over protective but then as the story progresses one sees the mother has good reason to be over protective. Huppert's piano teacher loves her mother it seems but also wants to torture her mother. For her students the piano teacher wastes no time with feelings it seems but again the performance is subtle and layered and offers clues that perhaps she does care for them in her way. It is possible to interpret some of her actions in more than one way. Ultimately we find it is only she herself she wants to humiliate/torture as we see her act out in various circumstances-- most notably in her actions toward a young student who has an infatuation with her-- her own self-degradation. Frame to frame the story is exquisitely shot and told. The music is used to incredible effect. In one particularly fabulous scene the director allows the high plane of music of a previous scene to follow Huppert into the next scene where she enters another plane,one that is not high.",1037577600,4,1991,4.724137931034483
1634037,5,B00005NFL5,"THE PIANO TEACHER goes places most film makers dare not tread - the dark aspects of frustrated sexuality where desire and affection cannot meet.  In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings.  This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy.  Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten.  Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict.  The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilharation that mirror the life inside a music academy.  We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and dsitorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students.  Yes, this is a distrubing film, but it is not a grotesque film.  Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches.  An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice.  An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed.",1037232000,19,1964,5.226114649681529
1634038,3,B00005NFL5,"Yikes. Where do I begin? Usually, I love watching foreign films, because they tend to rely more on telling a good story rather than special effects and big names. But I'm sorry to have to say that I was very disappointed with this one. ""The Piano Teacher"" revolves around a sexually repressed piano teacher who never smiles, and who is very icy with everyone, including a young man who, for some odd reason, claims to love her. She still lives with her nosy, sometimes intolerable mother in a small apartment, and sometimes you get the impression they hate each other. This woman also likes to go to porn shops to watch porn videos, and she likes to watch young couples getting hot-and-heavy at drive-in movies. A lot of this film's content is racy... Even though some scenes are, well, deserving of being un-rated, they are not done pornographically. After all, this is an artsy French film. It wasn't so much the racy content that bothered me, but more of how it was executed. By the end of the film, I was frustrated. The piano teacher treats this young man horribly, and freaks him out when she gives him a list of violent things she wants him to do to her doing sex. He, of course, isn't amused by this, but I spent the entire film wondering why he even loved her in the first place.
I kind of wanted to give this film one star, because I found a lot of it to be very disturbing. However, I can't because the movie is not a bad movie. The acting is superb, and the story, though not my cup of tea, is still a powerful, tragic story of a woman with some real problems. And of course, the music is great. So while it is not for everyone, it is an okay foreign film, so long as you're not looking for a feel-good one.",1036627200,11,1719,4.325077399380805
