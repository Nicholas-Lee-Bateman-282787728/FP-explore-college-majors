4262614,4,B004529NHK,"Yes, it is ""Teenage Paparazzo,"" not ""Paparazzi."" The singular noun has to be used because the documentary is about one Austin Visschedyk, a real-life 13-year-old boy chasing the Hollywood celebrity. Directed by Adrian Grenier, star of the TV series ""Entourage,"" who encountered and was instantly intrigued by the sight of a boy holding a huge camera, the film records the life of Austin Visschedyk living in West Hollywood, and examines the relationship between celebrities and paparazzi.

To understand what drives Austin Visschedyk (or the paparazzi and some media) to go to such lengths in order to get a photo of a celebrity, Adrian Grenier decides to follow the boy and how he ""works"" (often at midnight) waiting for the celebrities, surrounded by adults. Grenier even joins his activities disguised as a paparazzo himself. These are pretty fascinating moments.

Grenier also interviews Austen's parents to know what they really think about what their son is doing. The film wisely avoids falling into the pitfall of being overly judgmental, though Grenier, it is clear, is concerned about the boy's future, as seen in the latter half of the film. Is he encouraging him by documenting his life?

The film has interviews with Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, Whoopi Goldberg, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Eva Longoria, plus the ""Entourage"" stars Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon and Jerry Ferrara. Adrian Grenier also interviewed some of the paparazzi, who have naturally many things to say. He also flies to New York to visit OK! Magazine to let us know how the photos are sent to them (it has to be very fast).

To some ""Teenage Paparazzo"" may not offer new insights into what it is being a paparazzo or a celebrity. Those who are interested in the today's media and its problems will not be much surprised to hear what most interviewees are saying. ""Teenage Paparazzo"" is an entertaining film, but considering the complexity of the subject matter, the director's approach here - follow a teenage paparazzo - might not be the best one after all.",1297814400,,2043,5.0
4262615,5,B004529NHK,"Adrian Grenier, the lead actor in HBO's long-running Entourage series, discovers his life, inevitably, imitating his art. On his journey through celebrity-land Grenier has, inevitably again, become annoyed by and curious about the world of celebrity photographers - the ones with whom you don't have an appointment.

Everything in this wild and woolly world is normal - for a handsome rising star, that is - until one of his `sprayings' (When a paparazzo sets their camera to automatically take several shots in a very short period of time, the verb `to spray' is utilized to describe the phenomenon. `I sprayed her,' or, `I got sprayed'. With the flash on, the sprayee's eyesight is temporarily diminished. The metaphor to utilizing a machine gun is noted.) As Grenier's sight recovered, he noticed that the shooter was a young boy. ""How old are you?"" Grenier asked. ""Thirteen,"" the boy answered.

Thus, a great documentary was born. Grenier decided to befriend the boy, Austin Visschedyk, to learn about the world of the paparazzi, and, especially, about how and why it is that a 13-year old prodigy has joined their small celebrity-chasing cult.

While providing a glimpse, as fascinating as it is disturbing, into paparazzi world, ""Teenage Paparazzo"" profiles Visschedyk's work and character as well as the budding friendship between the teenage `pap' and the risings star. The young boy becomes the star's teacher. Because of Grenier's tenacity in this project, his consistent presence with nomadic groups of paparazzi, he, inevitably yet again, decides to walk a mile in the other side's shoes. Visschedyk helps him buy a `starter camera', and the two go `papping'.

But all this is simply the context for a much-more fascinating story - or stories. We see both Visschedyk and Grenier transformed by their friendship - they influence each other's view of the world, if not alter their respective destinies.

Grenier sprays his film with interviews of Visschedyk's parents, celebrities, journalists, magazine editors, paparazzi, psychologists, and academics. The viewer is left to ponder issues of celebrity, the story of Austin and Adrian, and, especially, what will become of the young shooter.",1294272000,4,2201,5.2592592592592595
4262616,4,B004529NHK,"This was a very interesting documentary. It pointed out the ridiculousness of American's fascination with celebrities. It was also interesting to see the development of the main character since he had such an interesting career choice at such a young age. The movie lets the viewer decide how they feel about the paparazzi at the end of the movie. Overall, I would recommend this movie!",1334534400,2,386,4.953846153846154
4262617,5,B004529NHK,"Teenage Paparazzo was gripping and very informative, turning the tables on the Paparazzi to show another perspective. Likewise, showing how destructive fame can be if you're not careful. Kudos to all who worked so hard on this film. Perfect, absolutely perfect! Will definitely be watching again and offering recommendations to friends for viewing as well. Congrats!",1313798400,2,366,5.553571428571429
4262618,5,B004529NHK,"I was expecting more of a movie narrative.  ""Teenage Paparazzo"" is more of a reality TV style documentary about Adrian Grenier and this Teenage Paparazzo (Austin).

The documentary examines this individual relationship as a micro-causem of fame and celebrities status.  The film covers all points of view, from street interviews to great interviews with academics. Grenier's view as very interesting, having made his fame playing a fictional movie-superstar.

I loved this, but I am a huge Entourage fan and interested in anything about ""the business"" of the business and all aspects of it.  I would say for a small niche audience, this is a great film and am unsure how it would be received by the masses.  If you are interested in the concept of Entourage, the actors and are interested in fame, celebrity and and our obsession with them, definitely watch this.",1312416000,2,863,5.0
4262619,5,B004529NHK,"The main criticism I would have about this documentary is its implied justification for what I consider an extreme case of parental dereliction of duty. This young man is 13 when his mom enables him to go out and be a ""teenage paparazzo,"" for crying out loud! What if he were kidnapped? assaulted? accidentally injured? He stays out until 3 am????? Good heavens!

Nonetheless, this movie provides superb insights into the psychology of media consumption. I'd already read Thomas de Zengotita's book, ""Mediated,"" and found it quite good. The fact that the book was the inspiration for this film and that the film did a very good job of illustrating de Zengotita's arguments was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.

I also did not expect the Hollywood lead, Adrian Grenier (of ""Entourage"" fame), to be so articulate and conversant with the subject matter, which was also a pleasant surprise. Emotionally, the best part of the film is its last 5 minutes, which I will not give away here. But suffice to say, had life not turned out as it had, I wonder if the film would ever have been commercially released.",1308787200,2,1105,4.810526315789474
4262620,4,B004529NHK,"A thoughtful and interesting analysis of fame and why people are fascinated by celebrity culture. Also, a warts and all examination of a young teenager who becomes a paparrazo and how it affects him.",1305504000,,199,4.882352941176471
4262621,1,B004529NHK,"Here is the only logic that matters when it comes to the twisted take on reality involved in celebrity culture. If you give obeisance to its logic, you forfeit any chance of really enjoying anything in a human way. It is the death of real art, insight, and depth. But, a certain TMZ logic appeals as well, feeding the human need to know something, even if trivial. I saw some of this documentary on TV, later heard the so-called Dr. Drew's disquisition on it with the auteur Grenier. The best thing I can say about the former is that he hit a high-note of confabulation by construing celebrity worship as a form of modern ""Aztec Temple"" religiosity. (I am not making this up!) And what can you say about Grenier but that he is cute. Hollywood is convinced that if they look hard enough they will find something socially telling or profound about the pseudo-culture they create. The only honesty is that it is the vacuum of entertainment. Meaning nothing, giving nothing, achieving nothing. They are searching for a transvaluation of values, and there is none, only money, and sops to money.",1302393600,,1090,4.682291666666667
4262622,5,B004529NHK,"I loved the film! It was both entertaining and informative, which can be a hard balance. Adrian Grenier did a great job exploring different aspects of celebrity-media relations. I liked that it was clear Grenier didn't set out with an agenda to make any side look a certain way. I think he wanted to learn while recording the process so as to also teach others. (Mission accomplished!) He even addressed ethical issues that arose during the making of the documentary.

Besides Austin, the 14-year-old paparazzo, being a perfect subject for the film, the interviews and examples included were perfect. There was never a dull moment.

With Teenage Paparazzo, Grenier showed he has talent behind the camera, not just in front of it. Can't wait to see what he comes out with next!",1302048000,2,776,4.871212121212121

4262624,5,B004529NHK,"I thought that Adrian did a simply fantastic job with this movie. Far from a vanity project, he delves deep into a world of questionable values, media and celebrity with aplomb. He manages to present all sides of this story in a manner that is both shocking and humorous. This is a very interesting and amusing doc.",1300320000,,315,4.543859649122807
4262625,5,B004529NHK,I really love Adrian Grenier's perspective on all things paparazzi.  Really cool to see what it's like for someone like Adrian- or Paris Hilton- who is always in the spotlight. This movie is completely unique and thought provoking.  I saw it months ago and am still haunted and inspired by it. Adrian Grenier is proving himself to be a impressive director.,1300233600,6,356,4.819672131147541

8416464,4,B004529NHK,"Like the title of my review, this clever documentary presents a unique and ironic perspective of one of the more unusual cultural celebrities of Hollywood. Grenier, an actor who plays an actor in a show about the vicissitudes of fame and in turn becomes famous for playing someone famous, directs a documentary about a young Los Angeles boy who has become a paparazzo as a hobby / business and in turn becomes famous and the subject of other paparazzi.

Sidebar commentaries about the ""business of fame"" and the selling and reselling of celebrities as a means of milking every possible penny from celebrities by companies like TimeWarner and NewsCorp is eye-opening and should be required viewing in every High School in Amerika.",1388620800,,729,4.975409836065574

8416466,5,B004529NHK,"I watched this documentary without expecting much of a cultural critique, but I was pleasantly surprised at how deeply it went into the issues of celebrity culture in American and the world.  By looking at the case of a teenage paparazzo (13 when the documentary began), the film, narrated by Adrien Grenier, explores the corrosive effects of celebrity culture.

We begin by liking Austin Visschedyk, the 13-year-old pap, as he calls himself, but over the course of the movie we see him becoming worse and worse.  Similarly, we also become more aware of the negative effects of the society's obsession with celebrities as a means of escape, as a way to imitiate the powerful, and as a way for media outlets to make money.

I suppose I wasn't expecting anything deep because Grenier is a celeb himself, but one of the somewhat ironic lessons of the film is that celebrities are people too as well as commodities.  Of course this is obvious but it's something well worth being reminded of.

And the scene where Paris Hilton reacts to the myth of Narcissus: believe me, you have to see it.  I'm not saying anything more for fear of succumbing to celebrity culture myself.",1344643200,2,1168,4.752475247524752
