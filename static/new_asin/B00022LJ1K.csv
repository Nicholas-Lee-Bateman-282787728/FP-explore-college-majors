That said, the disk offers only 43 minutes of talk and singing, the latter devoted mainly to arrangements of spirituals. For lovers of Marian Anderson, much better coverage of her career and singing of spirituals, lieder and opera can be found on line.",1497225600,,468,5.012820512820513

Her voice is unmatched - she will always be a one of kind artist.  This DVD is highly recommended.  Her music is for all generations and all walks of life.",1364428800,2,277,4.591836734693878
8020747,4,B00022LJ1K,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching and listening to Marion Anderson, I have always admired her for her graciousness and incredible singing.  I have been fortunate to have met her in Vancouver when I was a student in high school.  I will never forget that time with her..she made you feel so important.  I will look for more DVD's by her.",1274313600,6,332,4.593220338983051
