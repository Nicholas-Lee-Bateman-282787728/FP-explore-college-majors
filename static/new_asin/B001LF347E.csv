3682866,5,B001LF347E,"My sister and I have a hard time tearing ourselves away from Merlin whenever we are able to watch it.  The show is amazing!  It's a special thing for the two of us to do together, and let me tell you, waiting for her to watch another episode with me is torturous!  I look into Colin Morgan's eyes and all I can think is, MERLIN, I LOVE YOU.  Arthur and Gaius are amazing, too, though.  :]  I recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes a good fantasy storyline mixed with a bit of mystery and action!",1238544000,2,502,4.123711340206185
3682867,5,B001LF347E,That is the only way to put this show into words. We fell in love with it from the moment we saw it. It's extremely well written and very different from anything I've seen on TV before. Rob Lane does an amazing job with the music for the series as well.,1237593600,5,253,3.980392156862745
3682868,5,B001LF347E,"I absolutely enjoyed this show. The first episode hit on that the relationship between Merlin, the young magician, and Arthur, the prince of Camelot is essential and very important. As they meet, they both sort of hate each other, but destiny brings them together, like two sides of one coin for a reason. The first episode also made it clear that Magic is forbidden in this land, so it is intriguing to see how everything would turn out. If you give this show a chance, you will be surprised by twists and turns of the events. Unexpected story, like suspense, that's what come to my mind. Everything in the story is important as things will come together and make more sense.

The things I like the best are:

1. Great setting. The castle in this TV show is real and it's astonishing! It is one of the best castles in France. Some scenes also take place in Wales and the woods are so magical. I donno how they do it, but the whole setting, the nature, the castles are very mystical, fantastic and beautiful!

2. New actors. I hate big name actors. When I watch someone act, I don't want to think about the actor, I want to focus on the character, and that's what you get in this TV Show. The acting is brilliant. It is never overacted, so to keep you focused on the story. Because episodes tell the story in a fast paced manner, as there is so much to tell, the actors keep things smooth, clear and real. There are no awkward situations and the production is made to make you feel like you're there. I found myself worrying when the actors worried, even though I knew things would turn out fine. So the emotions are definitely pass on to the viewers from the skilled actors.

3. Characters and the friendship plot. The friendship is as complicating as it is deep and also very good. We learn about the relations of Merlin and Arthur that there is love, there are difficulties, mysteries, secrets, but we also learn about friendships among the rest of the many characters in this story. They are all interconnected and deepen as the story progresses. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't tell you who is friend and who is a foe. One thing I will mention is that every character has demons as they also have angels in them. Things may turn out for or against their relationships towards each other, you just never know how. That's what kept me watching this show. No one is too perfect or too evil. Everyone has flaws here, and they all react to them differently.  So the show is very focused on the development of characters while keeping the whole thing fast paced and action packed. I am amazed at their abilities to do that. There must be real good writers at this show. Each character has a whole lot to reveal through their past, present and even the future. I was surprised over and over by what I could learn about certain characters with each episode.

4. The magic. The magic in this story is essential, but we also know that it is forbidden in Camelot. At first I didn't like the idea as I was too afraid that we won't see much magic happen. I was wrong. There is plenty of magic in this show. It all comes from unexpected chain of events. Also, magic is not all great. There are many who want to use it for evil, so perhaps there is a reason it is forbidden in Camelot.....

5. Special effects. Some say the dragon in this show looks bad. I agree that it could have looked more realistic, but it is not horrible at all. In fact, it looks realistic to me. I mean, it doesn't look like an animal on geographic channel, but it does look like a mystical creature we've never really seen in life. It looks like it is done on the computer, but not to the extent that it is too obvious. You can still enjoy the dragon if you are not holding a magnifying glass in your hand trying to study its scales. The rest of the creatures and magical special effects in my opinion are great. They are just about the same as in Harry Potter movies.

6. Message on morality. Over and over I catch myself noticing good moral lessons in this show. For young people to watch this show, is not only to enjoy the story and catchy special effects, but also to learn lessons between choosing what is right in one's life. Characters are constantly tested and at crossroads. Each decision we make matters a lot for our own future and the people we love. Morals on friendships, respect, patience, good will, forgiveness. I still remember the episode called ""to kill the king"". It was the most amazing lesson on forgiveness I've ever seen done on TV.

Right now the show ended with the 13th episode, the last one of the first season and I can tell you, it is at its climax. The show has climbed up high in just 13 episodes. We now have more answers. We know the characters to heart, but we are also puzzled with new information given about them, as nothing is too certain and there are hidden skeletons on the closets. So that only makes things even more exciting. We also went through the pain, struggles, losses as well as joy, great friendships and miracles with these characters.

As far as some complaints you may face about this show... I've heard people expressing lots of hateful messages, like the show looks cheap, actors are horrible, etc, etc... I don't know if those people are blind, or if they even saw any of ""Merlin"", or are they just negative trolls who know nothing but spread negativity online. Some say that the show is not as true to the original legend. But If you don't like this interpretation of the legend, there are millions of other interpretations out there, and NO ONE really knows which one is the right one. I googles the legends of king Arthur and Merlin for weeks now and have found that no one really knows what happened. No one knows who was who's son, wife, friend, foe... No one knows who killed who and so forth... There are tales and songs from everywhere saying different things. Apart from that, people also complain about the acting, and the special effects. As I am a theater actor myself, I gotta say the actors are amazing. I have yet to see anyone in this show underact or overact. And the dragon effects don't bother me a bit, as I am too focused on paying attention to what's going on. BBC cannot put more money into this as they already have. As much as they put into this show, they did an amazing job. They keep the writing entertaining, deep and mysterious, and they keep the directing smooth, fast paces and beautiful. I have only one complaint, I want to see more!!!!!

So in the end of my review, I just hope that I was able to convince some of you to watch this show, and excite you somewhat as deep as I am excited about it. I hope I helped you lose some of you concerns and questions answered. Enjoy this TV serious with a simplistic heart and it will take you on a great journey! Cheers!",1230163200,290,6833,4.389415481832543
3682869,5,B001LF347E,"This new BBC series Merlin is one of the Best Shows I have ever watched !  I have seen every episode and I live in the US. Have downloaded and watched all the shows. The actors are great and so is Anthony Head as King Uther. Anthony Head as all recall played Giles on Buffy The Vampire Slayer..

It is filled with much magic and fun and great in my opinion for all ages but not too young for it my scare the little ones... All the on location filming from a real castle in France and other sites in the U.K. are amazing . This is a must see series to watch. I have read that it is supposed to be broadcast here in the US soon maybe and will be released on DVD but not known if it will be in Region 1 for US.. If you can find it on the internet and download all the episodes and watch as you are drawn into the story wanting to watch again and again to find out what Meriln's destiny is.....and best of all when you download them ..No Commercials !!

3682875,3,B001LF347E,This is an enjoyable show for the young.  It doesn't pay much attention to the actual story of King Arthur and the Knights of the round table.  My main problem is with the casting of Guinevere who should not be a woman of mixed race.  I really don't think that is appropriate for time of the story. Nice special effects and enjoyable as a fantasy for entertainment purposes only.,1484265600,,379,4.463768115942029

3682878,3,B001LF347E,"Eeh....  The series has some great people picked to play each role.  That being said, my goodness they play fast and loose with the characters and story behind the Arthur/Merlin legends.  If you know anything about the legends and especially if you are a fan - don't watch!  It will drive you crazy.  However, my kids love it and when I can suspend my frustration with the inaccuracies, there is a lot of humor and again, some great characters.  We've only gotten through the first season so far - my sister said she hated how it ended - guess I'll have to watch farther to comment on the end.",1481673600,,593,4.394495412844036

I am currently on season 4 and there has not been even 1 bad episode.  The dynamic between Prince Aurthur and Merlin is awesome, they are so funny together. I have grown to love King Uther too, he reminds me of the clueless king in the old cartoon Robin Hood movie who sucks his thumb.

It is family friendly so any age can watch it, but it is not corny at all.  It has lots of action and the stories are entertaining and fun.  I would give this show 10 stars if I could!  If you like LOTR, Narnia, Harry Potter, etc you will love this show I promise!

3682960,2,B001LF347E,"I really wanted to like it, but can't get over the difficulties I have with the morality of it. Uther the king is anti magic and mercilessly kills anyone born with the ability. Merlin is secretly magic. Somehow Uther is still a ""good guy."" Change ""sorcerer"" out for any other minority (Jew? Catholic? Gay?) and see how this show stands up. Would Uther's love for his son and his conviction of the righteousness of his zealotry be enough to cancel out his evil? I doubt it. Would Merlin still be a good guy for not standing up to him in an organized way? I doubt that, too. How about an underground railroad at least?

It's funny, because the show's authors hint at all these things, which would have made for some interesting moral dilemmas, and then they drop them. Over and over.

Also, the women's roles are abominable. Everyone is young and pretty and except for one character, scheming and evil. Oh- there's a good mom or two in a couple episodes, as plot movers. Oi.

Too bad, because the chemistry between the two leads (Arthur and Merlin) can't be beat and was enough by itself to keep me watching for most of the season. (Though the will-he-won't-he come out of the magician closet with Arthur got tedious and, according to SPOILERS! pretty much never ends throughout all the seasons)",1404691200,,1293,4.613043478260869

3682967,3,B001LF347E,"Started out with great hope. Maybe it is good for people unacquainted with the basics of the Arthurian legends. However I have been a fan of Arthur and his Camelot ever since I was a boy more than 60 years ago. This is a completely different take on the story. The names are the same but the characters have changed. Arthur is now a schoolyard bully. Arthur has not grown up at Sir Ector's home and he is the acknowledged son and heir of Uther. There are Asian knights, black Guineveres and blacksmiths. Everything is political correctness. Morgana Le Fey is now the King's ward! Lancelot is a commoner not the son of King Ban of Benwick. Mary Stewart, Bernard Cornwell, Gillian Bradshaw and other scholars of Celtic mythology must be dumbfounded at the liberties taken here. By themselves to those who are not serious fans of the era when Britain fought against the Saxon and Viking invasions the series is pleasant and entertaining. To the rest of us who heard and read the stories in our youth this is really a travesty.",1401580800,,1023,4.595628415300546

young Merlin arriving at Camelot (and almost immediately coming into ill-favor with young Arthur, the
future king).  There was a possibility this could have been an interesting ""what if"" depiction of early
stages of the Arthurian legend.  Alas, I was turned off by the patent absurdity of magic as depicted
in the series.  After the first 30-40 minutes, my wife and I both gave up.  An older child or a young
teen might enjoy watching this.",1398816000,,544,4.673684210526316
3682971,1,B001LF347E,"I must admit something very embarrassing.  Although this is the worst television series I have ever seen, I watched all five seasons!

I did.  I really did.  Why?  Because my kids wanted to see it, and I watched with them.  I couldn't believe it would get any worse, and yet each episode did, as did each season after the previous one.

My six-year old loved it and my twelve-year old liked it, so it definitely found itself an audience.

Be warned.  I will be giving spoilers.  But these spoilers will not make any difference because there are no surprises in this series.

First, don't expect the traditional story of Kind Arthur and Merlin in which Merlin is already an old man when he meets the young man will become King Arthur.  In this series, Merlin and Arthur are of an age with each other.

It begins with a teenage, Merlin, arriving at Camelot and running into a bullying knight who is -- surprise, surprise -- Prince Arthur.  Soon we meet Arthur's father King Uther who has a thing about wizards and witches and any practitioner of magic:  he hates them, hunts them, and kills them.  The backstory explaining this loathing is ridiculous but nonetheless makes more sense than anything else in the series.

Okay, I was willing to give it a chance.  The premise was interesting and I wanted to see where they would go with it.

There are only a few major plot lines over this long series:

First and foremost,  Merlin must never reveal that he has magic because if he does, he will be reported to Uther and will suffer a hideous death.

Second, Merlin must survive because he is the midwife (in a manner of speaking) to the growth of Arthur as Arhur reaches manhood and the throne of Camelot.  It is Merlin's Fate to do this as it is Arthur's fate to become king.

Third, Merlin becomes Arthur's servant and stays in that role for the entire series, not to reveal his prowess to Arthur until the next to last episode's of the series despite their relationship sometimes seeming to actually be a friendship.

Fourth, Arthur is stupid.  No, Arthur can tie his own shoes even though Merlin does it for him, but he isn't really capable of making an intelligent decision.  For example, despite Merlin saving his life approximately once per episode, for almost 20 episodes per season, Arthur never seems to correlate the mysterious events and Merlin's mysterious disappearances.

Fifth, Merlin is cold, callous, and almost equally stupid.  The premise is that Merlin is warm, caring, and very smart, but since the writer's of this nonsense didn't seem to possess any of these qualities themselves, they didn't pass them on to their characters.

In order to protect himself, for the sake of Arthur of course, Merlin watches hundreds, thousands or magic-cursed people being slaughtered by first Uther and then even Arthur.  Perhaps he has some excuse (not really, but what the heck, pretend he did); but there is no excuse under Arthur.

The premise seems to be that the ends justifies the means.  Supposedly Arthur was going to bring peace, prosperity and a return of magic to the land of Camelot; and therefore no price was too high; but as Arthur doesn't end up bringing these things to Camelot, then all those heaps of dead bodies were a waste beyond imagining.

And that's just the beginning.  Guided by a magical dragon and the court physician Gaius, Merlin is led to incredibly bad decisions.  For example, young Morgana who is a ward of Uther and discovering her own magical abilities needs someone to talk to in her time of loneliness and fear.  She needs to know she is not alone.  If Merlin would only take the risk of revealing himself to her, her entire future would probably have been different, particular as her character has been developed to that point.  But, no, Merlin doesn't reveal himself and eventually Morgana is led astray by someone who does reach out to her, someone who has cause to hate Uther and Camelot.  Merlin's decisions follow from the advice of Gaius and the dragon.  When he listens to them, he is wrong; when he follows his conscience, he is right; but his conscience slips season by season into a dark soulessness hidden by a clueless smile.

And then there's Mordred who is a young boy with magical powers who feels there is no one in Camelot who he can trust and no one there who understands what it is like to have magic.  And Merlin has the chance to reveal himself ... and wait a moment! wasn't that the plot of the last paragraph?  Oops, guess the series has some wicked lack of imagination.

Here is what is truly awful.  None of this would have happened if it weren't for Merlin showing up and trying to prevent.  It's like Back to the Future gone terribly wrong (or without a single writer with an IQ over 40) in which the preventer is the cause.  Wait a moment, there's a series called Terminator ... but, no, in that series, the writers knew what they were doing (at least as much as possible when playing games with time travel), but in this series the writers were playing games with fate and were totally, completely, horribly, depressingly, sadly, miserably incompetent to do so.

And that's all of my this junk is worth.  It helped me bond with my kids and if it helps you bond with yours, why, heaven bless you.  If you watch it for any other reason, well ...",1397952000,4,5317,4.609158679446219

The show is very well done and is very entertaining.  Everything is first rate. They have put their own ""spin"" on the Arthurian tale, but I like THIS version of the Arthurian tale better. DON'T compare to the known Arthurian legend - take this show for itself!!!

I noticed one reviewer gave this show a really bad review - obviously, they didn't get it, or just didn't like the subject matter.
This DVD HAS English subtitles for the hearing impaired and some nice extras. I'm only sorry there are only 13 shows. It's a bit pricey (for only 13 shows) so I will keep an eye on the other seasons to go on sale. I am looking forward to the other seasons.",1392768000,,825,4.14375

However, in the first episode Merlin finds himself rather unwillingly named a personal servant to Prince Arthur.  And the story, as foretold in legend, goes from there.

I was a little reluctant to start watching this show (thinking it would be too amateur and childish) but have since become a fan!  The series started off a little rocky and I remember rolling my eyes at some of the more sillier aspects of the story and characters (Uther Pendragon's rather foolish and irritating ways for example), however as the series as progressed the stories have become better, the characters and acting more settled.  I love the fact that very minimal computer CG effects have been utilized, Camelot for instance actually does exist!  You can visit the castle in France!  I remember being quite surprised when I discovered that fact.  Those elements give this series an authenticity that is lacking in other fantasy shows.  The actors who play the leads are quite entertaining and brilliantly cast.  Arthur and Merlin (Bradly James and Colin Morgan) are a perfect blend and play off each other rather well; Bradley being your quintessential medieval prince both in looks and demeanor (even down to his voice), and Colin the bumbling, goofy looking side kick who never quite gets the credit he deserves.  The two leads are supported by a host of other well respected actors who bring their A game to the series.  ""Merlin"" is filmed well enough for a TV series and the sets, props and costumes are minimalistic yet well designed.

3683052,5,B001LF347E,"I cannot tell you how much I adore this series! When you watch it at first, it is a little cheesy I'll admit, but then you're caught up in the story! From the beginning they are able to draw you in and make you care about these characters from the start. Filled with relative newcomers, only major recognizable face would be John Hurt and you don't see his face! He supplies only his voice, but with John Hurt narrating this tale, it starts off great and just keeps getting better. Just go ahead and buy this. You'll love it.",1371945600,,525,4.313131313131313

3683054,3,B001LF347E,"Ok, so I wasn't crazy about the first season of this show.  It seemed like the same thing happened every episode.  The visual affects were terrible.  But it was still somewhat entertaining.

BUT KEEP WATCHING.  If you can get through season one.  Merlin will be your favorite show!  Season two is about 100x better than season one!",1371081600,,331,4.701754385964913

The legend of King Arthur is no doubt based upon a real historical person, and this show takes the available literature & lore on the subject and takes the ball and runs with it.  The story lines are fantastically imaginative, the acting is superb and the settings are a visual feast for the senses. I cannot speak highly enough about this wonderful, wonderful series.  Bravo to the creators and to the actors!!! This show - just like the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable - no doubt will stand the test of time.",1370908800,,688,4.488
3683056,5,B001LF347E,"WONDERFUL ACTORS. As much as I love Colin, Bradley did have  larger role and he deserved an award
Loved it",1369267200,,106,4.3
3683057,1,B001LF347E,"My wife has a lower tolerance for fiddling with classic stories than I do, so when we started to watch the first episode, I found myself trying to defend it, feeling she'd not given it a fair break. By the end of the second episode (and by now I was watching alone), I realized she was just more perceptive than I.

From excising critical plot elements like Uther's death and Arthur's sojourn at Ector's home, to anachronisms like neatly-printed signs on the wall, this was cringe-worthy from the git-go.

Let's revisit Merlin's arrival, for example.  He walks up to a couple of guards and asks for the Court Physician. One grunts and points through the door they're (nominally) guarding, although they make no effort to find out who he is or why he wants to go through the door, so I'm not sure what they're doing can be called ""guarding"" (the grunt is presumably to avoid having to pay union scale for a speaking part). Upon entering the indicated passage, Merlin sees a very modern-looking sign that says ""Court Physician."" Why put a sign (as though people in Arthurian times were mostly literate!) *inside* the hallway that leads to the Physician's quarters?  After all, if you're already in the hallway, you're heading there anyway.

The first time Merlin hears the voice of the dragon (penned beneath the castle; apparently the series' writers were not aware that ""Pendragon"" comes from the Welsh meaning ""great dragon"" ie ""great leader,"" not ""he who penned the dragon."" 30 seconds on Google will bring you to this fact, but they apparently couldn't be bothered), he somehow figures out where the voice is coming from and decides to follow it.  He uses obvious magic to move the guards' dice into the shadows; each time the guard reaches for the dice, they skitter a little further away, prompting both guards to follow them. Oddly, despite this obviously magickal movement, it occurs to neither of them to scream bloody murder, or notice they're being led away from their posts. *sigh*

Merlin swipes a torch, sneaks down to the cavern, has a chat with the dragon, then... We never see how he sneaks back out past the guards, nor how he gets down to see the dragon again (several times). Sooner or later the guards are going to figure out something is hinky with their dice if it keeps happening, but after that first time Merlin seems to be able to waltz down to have frustrated chats with the dragon at will.

Despite a prohibition on magic that carries a death sentence, Merlin uses his magic to save Gaius' life and keep himself from a beating, both times in what looks like pretty blatant ways. He later uses it to hide a book of spells in what seems an unnecessarily risky way--pulling a blanket over the book, rather than pushing the book under something. The searcher is much more likely to see a whole blanket moving than to see the book slither out of sight, especially since the book is on the far side of the bed from the searcher, but Merlin chooses to move the blanket. If you're going to take that kind of chance, why not just whip the book up to the ceiling? This level of incompetence in hiding his powers makes me wonder how Merlin survived more than about twenty minutes, let alone manage to grow to young-adulthood.

The court physician can mix antidotes for snakebite if he just has access to the original venom, people of obviously African descent are unremarkable, everyone and everything is amazingly clean, the windows are full of glass (seriously?), and the architecture looks like something from the Renaissance. I don't mind that kind of mixture at a Ren Faire (as a friend of mine put it Ren Faires are for people who ""think the Renaissance is everything pre-Beatles""), but I can't stomach it in an allegedly period piece.

Plot holes, anachronisms, and wild departures from anything resembling classic Arthuriam mythos just made this unpalatable. Countless writers have taken a swing at interpreting the Arthurian Cycle, some (Marion Zimmer Bradley, Jack Whyte, Mary Stewart) quite good, and where they strayed from the myth they either did so in ways that didn't abuse the myth, or they strayed far enough that it was clear they were trying something pretty different.  This version is smack dab in the middle of the Uncanny Valley.

I made it through two episodes. I almost stopped watching when a tournament contender showed up called ""Knight Valiant,"" but decided to watch the rest of the episode--I have no one to blame for that but myself.

If the writers had created a fantasy series out of whole cloth, rather than trying to co-opt the Arthurian legend, a lot of my criticisms would be defused. Design a fantasy world, even call it ""Albion,"" and run with the plotlines and relationships they used, and this would have been something I could have dealt with--maybe even enjoyed--but as it is, I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather than spending my hard-earned gold on it.",1368403200,3,4924,4.745029239766082

If you are a fan of anything to do with the Arthurian Legend, you will enjoy this show. It does not strictly adhere to the legend, but rather puts its own take on events, characters and places within the context of the legend. What has entertained me the most with this series is the excellent acting from the ensemble cast of relatively unknown actors, in particular Colin Morgan as Merlin himself. The writing can be suspect at times, but the acting more than makes up for those lapses. The settings and special effects do well to keep the fantasy in tact. I have enjoyed this show form beginning to end, and am sorry that it has come to an end. I know I will wear out my DVDs watching whenever I need a Merlin fix!!",1362182400,,828,4.314102564102564

But, nothing compares to the relationship of Arthur and Merlin. Seriously one of the best OTP's out there. They annoy the hell out of each other, are constantly chastizing and goofing about the other. But, that's what brothers do. When the time comes, they would do absolutely anything for each other.

This version of the youth of Merlin is very much in the medieval tradition, while appealing to the modern viewer. FIrst of all, it satisfies, like much popular medieval literature, the people's curiosity about the youth of its heroes. In this way is is typical of the medieval spinoff.  It also uses all the old forms of romance and fabliau, but the boys, Arthur and Merlin, are lovely.

Yes, the CGI can be pretty cheesy at times, but I think that's par for the course when it comes to BBC shows like this. On the plus side, they don't happen all that often. Some people might be put off by the 'historical inaccuracies,' but come on. You can't get more historically inaccurate than magic and dragons being 100% real. It's a fantasy show, not a documentary. Besides, a medieval plague filled 'England' doesn't sound like a very fun time.

However, these supposedly new DVDs looked anything but. Bent and faded corners on both the outer sleeve as well as the DVD case itself. The discs had some minor scratches too. Considering I bought this from Amazon and not a third-party seller, I was quite surprised. The DVDs also have some problems during play. The play all feature sometimes freezes while switching from one episode to the next. One time it even caused my computer to completely crash.

Love the use of the castle at Pierrefond in France, and the use of the Andalusian horses.  The involvement of the horses grows over the series as well as the actors learn to ride; by season 2 they are doing most of their own riding.

May be a little violent for sensitive children, but never any blood or guts. Even if someone is obviously run through by a sword, it emerges bloodless.

3683106,5,B001LF347E,"Having given this first season to myself as a Christmas treat, I sat down to watch the first episode yesterday. Nine episodes later I was still watching. I think the acting is superb. If you are on the edge of your seat worrying about characters getting killed that you know grow up to be adults then the actors have done their job. Usually in magical productions, the characters are much more two-dimensional. Here, you have real people, even with the magic. They make mistakes, sometimes what seems to be a good idea turns out to be a bad idea. I love the dragon (I like dragons) and John Hurt has done an excellent job (as always) with the voice. I love the scenery. 'Cheesy' is when they do everything on a sound stage - that's 'cheesy'. This production has plenty of scenes that expand out into the 'real world'. I like that I know the story so I know how these characters will turn out - turning this into a prequel of how it all came to be.

3683107,4,B001LF347E,"I'm a bit of a history buff, and it is part of the entertainment watching ""Merlin"" for me to note all the assorted ways its producers managed to screw up history. I mean, not that we know a whole lot about 6th century Britain, but we know enough to understand that Arthurian Camelot (if and when it ever existed) looked nowhere closer to its depiction in the series. Which is probably best described as one part late middle ages, one part renaissance fair. It probably tells us more about 21st century UK than about 6th century. (Seriously, casting an Indian actress as Guinevere? Not that there's anything wrong with it.)

Other than that, it's a mildly entertaining PG-rated show, nothing too gruesome or complicated. Pillars of the Earth it is not. I guess it was targeted primarily at the adolescent & teen audience. Adults can watch too if you're tired and you just want to relax.",1356393600,,885,4.673076923076923

3683124,5,B001LF347E,"""Merlin: The Complete First Season"" is a mystical and uplifting show around the spiritual tests of each character in Merlin.  All the actors contributed in each way towards the outcome of the overall resident well-being in Camelot. Colin Morgan cleverly plays the character of a Merlin who must help King Arthur Pendragon(powerfully played by Bradley James) without revealing the use of magic. John Hurt plays a compelling role of ""The Great Dragon"", a being who Merlin secretly consults with for help in magically prevailing over various tests. Richard Wilson plays Gaius, a firm and wise mentor to Merlin. Anthony Head plays the convincing role of Uther Pendragon, a headstrong father to King Arthur who is extremely brutal to those caught practicing magic. However, Head's portrayal of Uther also means well in protecting his son Arthur Pendragon and maintaining a good kingdom for his citizens. Angel Coulby and Katie MCGrath persuasively play the characters of Guinevere and Lady Morgana Pendragon.  I also really enjoyed that the show portrays two female characters that are loyal friends to each other. Additionally, Katie McGrath's Lady Morgana plays an assertive and clairvoyant woman who courageously stands by Angel Coulby's Guinevere character in both happy and adverse times. The first season Merlin dvds contain among the following great bonuses:
Behind The Magic (Parts One and Two): All of the characters are covered in their full glory and are shown as down to earth people who just want to contribute towards a meaningful show.
Video Diaries divided up by Colin Morgan and Colin, Bradley, plus the Cast: I enjoyed seeing them share what they go through in perfecting various scenes for the series.  It was also great watching all of them having a fun time at a theme park roller coaster.
Photo Gallery: There are superb photos of both the key villians and the benevolent characters during the first season.
Wallpapers: You have to insert this dvd into your computer, but there are an eclectic assortment of images that one can view for desktop background ideas.
 There are 13 episodes divided among 4 dvds, with the fifth dvd  featuring the bonuses and wallpaper. Of course I enjoyed each episode. However, my two overall favorite episodes from the first season are ""Moment of Truth"" and ""The Labyrinth of Gedref"".  ""Merlin: The Complete First Season"" is best for those who enjoy mystical tv shows with spiritual themes.",1345334400,2,2438,5.113065326633166

3683126,5,B001LF347E,"Merlin seems like an attempt to build off the success of Harry Potter - a TV show about teenage wizards and princes. The series is loosely based on the legend of King Arthur and Merlin in Camelot. I say loosely because it is essentially about the adventures of young Arthur and Merlin. Each episode, the two get into trouble, very much like the early Harry Potter books. However, this show has a lot more spirit than the over-produced Harry Potter movies.

What I really appreciate about the show is its maturity, despite its focus on younger characters. The humor is (generally) not slapstick humor, but rather in emphasizing the absurdity of the situations Arthur and Merlin find themselves in. The show gets dark at times and doesn't shy away from death, but also keeps it in good taste - unlike HBO's Game of Thrones, which seems to delight in bloodshed.

Merlin also develops its characters, something very hard to do on a TV show. Most TV shows tend to focus on the ""threat of the week"" and rush over character development. It's not uncommon for the characters to remain the same throughout. However, Merlin's characters do have their respective journeys. Arthur in particular goes from callous knight to mature ruler with a sense of responsibility. The show also treats the other characters subtly with few heroes and villains. I especially appreciate how Uther Pendragon is never portrayed as simply a villain, but rather a king with heavy emotional and political burdens to bear.

Moreover, Merlin stays true to the atmosphere of the Middle-Ages, with a few obvious deviations. I'm not a historian, but do read a lot of history and there isn't too much I've noticed wrong with the historical details of the era. Although given that it's based on the fictional kingdom of Camelot some liberties are expected. Given that this is a TV show, I'm actually quite impressed with the attention to detail in the sets and clothing.

Overall, if you like Harry Potter, check this show out.",1343433600,4,1987,4.8352941176470585

The story starts out with Merlin coming to Camelot for his Mother sent him to stay with the court Physisian Giaus an old man who knows much of magic, which the king has forbidden. Upon meeting Arthur, Merlin talks back to the rude Prince who Merlin decides is a brat and the two end up dueling. As the story progesses Merlin learns he is destined to help Arthur become a King that will bring back magic and has to secretly use magic to save Arthur countless of times, allthewhile Arthur unaware.

3683137,3,B001LF347E,"British television series can be hit or miss with American audiences but some of them become immensely popular and a decision was made to test out programming on the general public on a non-cable network to see if the latest family fare from England would stick. Merlin takes all the legends of the knights of the round table and turns them on their head but for the most part is solid entertainment and certainly better than some of the alternatives. It's also less campy than its precursor, Robin Hood.

Magic has been outlawed in the kingdom of Camelot due to ""grave offenses"" by wizards and warlocks and so anyone with extraordinary gifts must remain hidden for fear of persecution and death. Young sorcerer Merlin (Colin Morgan) has come to Camelot at the insistence of his mother, who believes he will have a better life outside their impoverished village, but has difficulty not revealing his telekinetic abilities when faced with the bullies of the city, among them the arrogant Prince Arthur (Bradley James). Immediately getting off on the wrong foot with the heir to the throne does him no favors when the king's physician (and a former user of magic) Gaius (Richard Wilson) agrees to mentor him in the hope of further training his abilities. But his unique talent might be revealed when a resentful sorceress visits Camelot intending to have revenge for her mother's death.

While learning much from the old dragon that imprisoned beneath the castle until the ""old ways"" are reinstated, Merlin hones his skills, attempts to be a good valet to the noble Arthur, and is of interest to the two women in his life -- the hard-working servant girl Guinevere (Angel Coulby) and her mistress, the secretive and beautiful Morgana (McGrath). Woven throughout the first season are encounters with other characters that will become important in Arthur lore -- including a visit from a young peasant who wishes to become a knight (Lancelot), and a child with abnormal magical abilities (Mordred). I was not too impressed with the first couple of episodes. I didn't like their casting decisions all that much and thought Arthur was depicted as too much of a jerk, but after awhile he calmed down and made leaps toward becoming the noble majesty we know so well from various films and legends.

The cast are all very good but I do question their judgment in certain areas. The actress playing Gwen is likable enough but she doesn't seem to live up to the reputation Guinevere has of being the most beautiful woman in the kingdom... not to mention the fact that she is a servant. I'm not sure I like how much the legends have been changed to modernize and rejuvenate the material but on the flip side, Morgana is a stroke of brilliance. She is much under-used in the first half of the season but really comes into her own as the series continues and by the end is one of the most interesting characters. The costuming is not accurate but is so gorgeous and unique in kind of a ""punk medieval"" style that I don't mind. Certain of Morgana's gowns in particular are exquisite. My only real complaint is that the CGI leaves much to be desired and shows a limited budget, but since it is infrequent that fault can be overlooked.

It might not be everyone's cup of tea and is aimed at a younger age group, but the writing is decent enough and the cast good enough that it is easy to sit back and enjoy it as something you will not have to fast-forward your way through. If you can stomach some changes to the legend in favor of a new approach, I think you will enjoy Merlin.",1332892800,9,3563,4.650793650793651

3683149,5,B001LF347E,"General Review
If you are a fan of med-evil ways and castles, this is as surreal experience as you're going to ever get without major animation and film making. Merlin brings a new fresh look on what would've went on when Arthur was growing up and ascending to the throne of Camelot. The general feel of the series is quirky and sometimes it does get boring at certain episodes when they focus too much on certain ""bland"" characters/actors but it is great nonetheless.  I RECOMMEND THIS WHOLEHEARTEDLY!

Those who have loved Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, etc etc... This will make you smile! However, it does use tactful animation and doesn't over-use it. And even though it's educational, it doesn't feel that way at all once you're watching it. It's the best PG-rated series to use as reference if a school or teacher or anyone wants their children to latch onto. :) You'll love it!

Characters In my own opinion
The characters on Merlin have such life-like capabilities that haven't always been played out very well on TV series. I, for one, don't really care for ""NAME BRAND"" actors but I love that they placed Anthony Head in this series (even though he plays the hard headed King of Camelot). He's been the best male actor for TV series that I've liked ever since he was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. :)

For Merlin; I have to admit that I didn't quite like his appearance since his hair is cut in an odd way where his ears look like they're too big for his head. And at times, I wish Merlin had a stronger confident moral in what he truly believes in. Throughout the whole series he battles against being told off for heresy and his status as a servant boy. His magical abilities are basically the only reason I got interested in his character.

For Uther; Completely plays out the ""Old stick in the mud"" neatly and crisply... well, too crisply for my liking.

For Arthur; They chose an excellent actor to play as the Prince of Camelot. He beautifully puts forth all the arrogance, over-conceited and handsome allure of royalty quite nicely.  However, it does get over-bearing as the series progresses that his attitude becomes too typical and keeps suppressing his compassion.

For Gwen; I have to say, it came quite a shock to who played Gwen. Even the actor who played her father was a bit lack luster but I loved that they played on a ""woman's strength"" to aspire and overcome adversity to stand up to men. I just wish she'd upper cut Morgana when she had the chance.

For Morgana; Her character in this series is weak, over-used and sometimes not really needed. The other villains bring more to the table than Morgana's ever does in this series. But I guess there has to be a constant thorn in the side to progress the story of Merlin throughout the whole seasons of this show...

For Gaius; I love him! And I'm glad they don't ever kill him off. His personality aids and encourages Merlin's developement. Without him, I doubt there'd be much Magical conundrums from Merlin himself when he tries to save, heal, or correct some magical mis-doings. But I wish he had more magical involvement even if he's gotten old.

For the Knights of the round table; I have to say... most of them didn't feel right and some of them did.

REVIEW UPDATE AS OF 5/3/2012
I have successfully watched all the Merlin episodes until they stopped at the ""Sword in the Stone."" As I mentioned before... Arthur's character of ignorance and arrogance is too over-bearing. Merlin still constantly keeps his secret within a closed circle and it's annoying that he can't confine in Arthur at all. Plus, the episodes where they increase Arthur's half-arsed feelings for Merlin when he's in danger is just...ugh. I have felt like Arthur and Merlin should just end up together as a couple... Gwen keeps running away PERSISTENTLY! At first I did enjoy Gwen's ""I am woman, HEAR ME ROAR!"" but when it involved Arthur, she was just stupid. I know love can be stupid but that had nothing to do with love. I think they gave her commitment issues on purpose because it was TOO drawn out, leading up to her getting married to Arthur. Gaius survives the WHOLE entire series, which I love. Killing off Lancelot was... confusing. I mean, I know the rift between the underworld and the real world needed to be closed but that was just a waste to get rid of a person who COMPLETELY accepted Merlin for who he was.

I still recommend this series and still love it all the same, though. I just got disappointed along the way...",1327536000,3,4501,4.604244694132334

If you are looking for accurate portrayals of ancient myth, this isn't for you, but if you are looking for fun stories, fun dialogue, engaging characters, and clean content, I highly recommend this series.  Yes, it gets a bit silly at times, but underneath the contemporary feel of the script lies a message about tolerance, true courage, and loyalty.  We are hooked, and I am just sad that I have to look elsewhere for seasons past the first one because Amazon doesn't carry them...and they are not easy to find because it is a BBC series.",1326240000,2,582,4.631067961165049

My love for Arthurian legend, fantasy, humor, suspense, and much more is met (if not blown away) by this series.  BBC has definitely hit the mark with this show. They take a new spin on the age-old legend, yet stay true to the main ideas and concepts (aside from the fact that Merlin is NOT an old man).  The actors portray their characters exceedingly well. Colin Morgan is amazing as Merlin, and Bradley James fits perfectly into the role of Arthur. I would recommend this show to anyone. It is appropriate for all ages (I have gotten my whole family hooked on it, and my youngest sister is only 9).

3683157,5,B001LF347E,"I saw this show online before it started airing on BBC America. I've seen all 4 seasons and can't wait for the next. After the first episode, I was instantly hooked. The show is about The wizard Merlin at a young age (late teens, early 20's). Set in a time when magic is outlawed in Camelot, Merlin's magical abilities have to be kept secret from everyone. The story follows Merlin as well as other main characters (Prince Arthur, who is not yet king for example, as well as Lancelot and others). The show is appropriate for all ages (though some small children may get scared of some of the creatures (it's no scarier than Harry Potter). Each episode has a plot which usually includes Knights, Dragons, Witches, and of course Magic, and contributes to the main story line. The show is family friendly, includes episodes which are about different things and includes drama, friendship, romance, and a few that are hilarious. My Fiancee and I love this show. For those who have seen movies based on King Arthur or read literature, know that the show has it's own different version of re- telling the story, yet it's very enjoyable. A few visual/special effects are not the best in the world like the big office box movies(since it's doubtful they get a huge budget for those things), but the effects are pretty good for a tv show, realistic enough, gets better with each season and doesn't at all take away from the creativity, plots and story. I will be getting seasons 2,3 and 4 as well. The only negative is that I wish there were more episodes for each season (Each episode is about 45 min long and each season has 13 episodes), not enough in my opinion, especially since they're all so good.

3683159,5,B001LF347E,"Once again Merlin takes our notions of what the sword of Excalibur is meant for and turns it into something more powerful than just a weapon for Arthur.

As with all things with the show, Merlin himself, along with the powerful magic of the Great Dragon, once again is instrumental in creating Excalibur, one of the best known symbols of Arthurian legend. Although its creation stems from the past mistakes of King Uther Pendragon. The use of a wraith, summoned by the sorceress Nimue to avenge the death of Uther's wife Igraine, as the reason for creating Excalibur is a very novel approach for creating a weapon that is made specifically for Arthur to destroy that which is already dead.

This episode more than the others shows Uther as more than just a cold-hearted king with a pathological fear of magic, but a warrior king and a self-sacrificing father. Uther is a complex man here.

This is another episode that provides the origin of one more symbol for those familiar with some of the Arthurian legends -- but in its own ""Merlin-esque"" way.",1323820800,,1049,4.721311475409836
3683160,4,B001LF347E,"Merlin once again gives an interesting spin to pre-Arthurian Legend with Lancelot and Guinevere.

Although we know Gwen (Guinevere) as a servant, a departure from the legends, we now have Lancelot being introduced as not just a commoner, but one whose heart belongs to Guinevere as only one can when ""love at first sight"" happens. Merlin is the catalyst. Lancelot saves Merlin's life, and as thanks he wants to make Lancelot's dream to be a knight of Camelot a reality. But Merlin also sets in motion the start of Guinevere's and Lancelot's romance when he enlists Gwen's help in outfitting Lancelot to pretend he is of noble birth to gain that knighthood.

This is one of those episodes that is so sweet with the tentative looks and actions of the two sweethearts, and the nobility and humility of Lancelot. Angel Coulby and Santiago Cabrera seem perfectly matched as the two lovers. The musical themes used to highlight the romance between them and the bravery of Lancelot seem to underscore those moments quite brilliantly.

A very enjoyable take on the Legend of Guinevere and Lancelot.",1323820800,,1090,4.913043478260869

I waited a long time to write a review because my complaint is NOT about the show itself and I didn't want to give a low score in a review that should be about the show not the merchant. The show would get 5*! But the merchant failed to make things right so I wanted to warn any future buyers. I purchased Merlin Seasons 1 & 2 on Amazon marketplace for my 9-yr old's birthday, from a merchant called 'powersellmachine' with high rating, advertising his product to be new, factory sealed and genuine copy. Sadly, upon receipt I noticed that both DVD sets looked and played as if they were bootleg copies. DVD cover/box as well as the DVD labels seemed like bad photocopies. While the set was advertised to be original, it is in fact of worse quality than most of the old VHS tapes. It has to be some aftermarket, bootleg copy. I contacted merchant several times but no response. Paid over $50.00 for the two sets, quite a chunk of change and am left with useless DVDs and an upset 9-yr old.

The actors are excellent (barring the woman who plays Morgana who is one of those unfortunate actors who think you look really sincere if you move your eyebrows a lot), and the stories are fun and reference the arthurian legends just enough to give me geeky thrills whenever I recognize a character name or a particular quest, but not so much that I already know exactly what's going to happen. (Btw Buffy fans will recognize the actor who played their beloved Giles in the character of Uther Pendragon)  The show is totally anachronistic and the humor can be juvenile at times, but it's light-hearted and fun, so what more can you ask for from a modern fantasy?  The bro-mance between Arthur and Merlin is hilarious, and the show only improves as it gets older, so check out this season and then keep moving forward (the newest season is starting soon, so you better catch up).",1315267200,,990,4.777777777777778

This is kind of ""Merlin and co. are all teenagers together"" and the show's creators don't seem to be concerned with being overly ""high brow.""

This is clearly a First Season.  Meaning, the actors become more comfortable with their characters, scripts, and sets.  Some of the episodes are a bit rough and rocky (some are downright silly) but overall its good.

I find this show to be entertaining, if a bit fluffy (tho it does have its moments of depth), and the main cast (especially Collin Morgan and Bradley James)fun to watch.",1314835200,,806,4.755395683453237

I find the character of Merlin himself a little difficult to believe but that's a minor issue (my wishing maybe a different actor played the part).  The show seems pointed at young adults in their 20s but has serious themes and although mostly PG, does veer into PG13 territory at times.  I really like the character of King Uther, who really does make tough decisions that seem wrong but when placed in context of his duty to the kingdom, seem totally appropriate (here I disagree with others who would love nothing more than to see this character get killed off).  The music is excellent.  True the special effects aren't so good at times, showing a limited budget for digital animation.  But if less money there means a lower budget and possibly a longer life for this series (although I believe it is planned for a total of 5 seasons) then I'm all for that.

The acting, directing, and writing are precious and overly sentimental and the retconning of the arthurian legend seems so unnecessary as to make one wonder why they didn't just create a whole brand new story with new characters and call it something else entirely. I'm disappointed that they made Arthur, Gwynn, Merlin, and Morgana all the same age. It's like watching Young Hercules with all that entailed. If you're a true fantasy fan, don't waste your time with this, especially if you like the more classical stories of Camelot and King Arthur.",1309824000,5,681,4.829059829059829

The depth of the characters increases, the humour becomes more sophisticated, and the intensity of what's happening goes up. The plot becomes more involved as well. It's really great fun, and the characters are brilliant. The scripting is incredibly well done. Colin Morgan plays the young Merlin, a manservant to Prince Arthur (Bradley James) in a Camelot ruled by King Uther (Anthony Stewart Head of Buffy) where magic is forbidden on pain of death. Thus, Merlin must save the prince from magical enemies, all while pretending to be the bumbling servant. The banter between Arthur and Merlin is amazingly good fun, and their burgeoning friendship is really sweet.
The first season itself doesn't have the gel that I would like, but as the season goes on, all of the characters do begin to come together like a well-oiled machine, and everything falls into its niche. Not to say that the season is bad, it's far from that--it's very entertaining, but keep in mind it only gets better from the first season!
And I hope that's a glowing-enough review to send you off to watch it!

Keep in mind, Arthurian legend purists, that this is really not accurate in many ways. The writers and actors have admitted that they're not keeping strictly to legend. And you obviously see that.

I don't know the actors so they are new to me but they are more awesome than i can imagine.  I love how these actors are played out in this tv series, not too much of acting nor little but it makes me put myself into the story line.  It shows the bond between to friends and their strength and weakness and like all friends (in males) there is so much pride there but in all there is love shown and how merlin and arther become the best of friends later in life.  This is a story line of how arther and merlin came to be and how there friendship can over come anything.  without the other its in complete.

The music was well done and often epic enough to make people in the next room wander in asking if I was watching the lord of the rings trilogy! The acting was overall excellent, the storylines well done and the landscapes and environments were beautiful. The special effects were a bit spotty, but this is television and there are budgets and time considerations so I wasn't expecting brilliance there. Very good for tv of course. I'd have to say that the show is probably meant for young adults, but its enjoyable if you are not expecting very intricate plots. I enjoyed season one enough to buy the second season, and that was even better.

I have only one issue with season one, and you should stop here if you wish to avoid even a hint of spoilers.

My only complaint with season one was how very little changed during the course of the show. There were no major relationship changes, no major revelations, no major deaths (perhaps one minor side death). Things 'reset' to a comfortable norm by the end of episodes, which can be rather dull after a time because you start to anticipate that new enemies don't really mean anything, as everything will just go back to the way it was and everyone will live happily ever after at the end of it all. I'm happy to say, this is NOT an issue in season two. If you liked season one, you will like the show even more as it progresses. I gave season one 4 stars mostly because of this, but would gladly give 5 for the next season.",1303689600,,1549,4.431578947368421

The graphics aren't as great as they could be, but they are good, and get better as the episodes/seasons go on, so I've noticed.

Overall the show is flat-out spectacular!",1296172800,,533,4.857142857142857

3683194,2,B001LF347E,"... because the characters have nearly nothing to do with Arthurian legend.  Yes, Arthur is Uther's son, Merlin is a wizard, Morgaine is an enchantress, and maybe I forgot some other superficial similarities that this bears to the actual legend; apart from these, there is basically no similarity.  I wish that they had just given the show and the characters different names so that people who are familiar with the legend (i.e., have read Morte d'Arthur, The Once and Future King, some of Marion Zimmer Bradley's wishful thinking/historical revisionism, and others) wouldn't find this so confusing and difficult to watch.  As it is, I can hardly bear to watch it; it's as though someone wrote a book in which Palpatine was the emperor, Vader was his second-in-command, Luke was Vader's son, and Leia was Luke's sister, but it took place in the Doctor Who universe and the plot was something out of a Gareth Roberts book.",1294358400,9,921,4.891025641025641
3683195,4,B001LF347E,"We've only watched one episode off the DVD so far, but it's a great show to watch with the kids.  I have a 14 year old and an 11 year old - both boys - and they really enjoyed watching it with us.  Quality was good.",1294185600,,215,3.652173913043478
3683196,4,B001LF347E,"It's funny how you change your mind about things. I remember seeing the previews for this BBC import when it began airing on NBC and later SciFi Channel, but honestly thought it looked... well, kind of bad. Then, this summer I got hooked on another Medieval Fantasy show, Legend of the Seeker, and noticed many LOTS fans also seemed to be fans of Merlin. ""Well,"" I thought to myself, ""if this show's so popular among LOTS fans, it can't be all bad."" So I decided to check it out, and man, am I glad I did!
The first few episodes are... well, they're not very good, but they were enough to keep me watching, and by the middle of the season the show had drastically improved. The last seven episodes (there are 13 total) definitely make up for the shaky first half.
As others have pointed out, the special effects are not the best, to put it kindly (come on, this is a BBC show, what did you expect?), but really, the SFX are actually not that important. This show is all about the characters, and the choices that those characters make. The ""magic"" is really an afterthought. And the characters are all well-written and well-played, my favorite being the jerk with a heart o' gold Prince Arthur, who goes through some of the best written character development I've ever seen, from spoiled brat at the beginning of the show to a kind-hearted, though still rather thoughtless, young man. You can really see what he'll be like as the Once and Future King.
Though Arthur's my favorite, I'd have to say that Colin Morgan puts in the best performance as the title character. Richard Wilson is fine as Gaius, nothing revelatory about his performance, just good. Anthony Head does a great job of making Uther the character you love to hate, and is obviously having a ball. Angel Coulby as Guinevere really grows as an actress over the show, as does Gwen as a character. Indeed, now that the first three seasons have aired, I would say that Colin and Angel are the show's strongest actors. Katie McGrath rounds out the main cast as the infamous sorceress Morgana, and though Katie is a fine actress and I love her character, I would have to say that she is the weakest actor of the main cast. She does improve over the course of the show, however.
All in all, unlikely as I thought it would be, Merlin has not only become my favorite adaptation of Arthurian legend, of all the books and movies and TV productions based on it, it is currently one of the best shows on TV. And the best thing is, it improves with every season. Season two was miles better than season one, so much so that I would almost encourage potential viewers to start with season two if I didn't find the idea of watching a show out of order so abhorrent. And season three is the best yet by far!
I was overjoyed to hear that it was renewed for a fourth season, and I can only hope that it continues the pattern of each season being better than the last. Also, here's hoping we do get that fifth and final season!",1293580800,,2973,4.436928702010969

It's on it's third season as of 29 Dec 10, and you can only find the first on here in the states.  If they would market this in the US, Im sure it would be a big hit.

3683213,5,B001LF347E,"This is one of the best tv shows around. It takes place when Merlin and Arthur Pendragon were young men in Camelot.

Plot.. Merlin has magical powers and arrives at the city of Camelot, after his mother arranges for him to become an apprentice of Gaius. He discovers that the king, Uther Pendragon, has outlawed magic and has imprisoned the last dragon deep under the city. The dragon informs him that he Merlin has an important destiny to protect Uther's son, Arthur, who will bring forth a great Kingdom. When he meets Arthur for the first time he discovers that he is arrogant and a bully, but after he saves Arthur's life, he is reworded with a job in the Royal Household as Arthur's manservant, and they become close friends. Arthur is unaware of Merlin's magical ability, as Merlin has to keep it a secret or face execution at the hands of Uther. Morgana is Uther's ward with the power of prophetic foresight, which frightens her and which she keeps secret. Gwen is her maid servant and close friend. The first series focused on the development of Merlin and his friendship with Arthur. The second series focuses more on development of the other cast members. Some of the central themes of the series are the budding romance between Arthur and Gwen and Morgana's struggle to control her powers. Other characters from Arthurian legend have appeared. Lancelot longed to become a knight, but unable to do so because of his birth as a commoner. Mordred has appeared as a Druid boy who formed a bond with Morgana ( In some legends he is Morgause's son) and it has been predicted by the dragon that Mordred will be the cause of death of Arthur (In legend this occurred at the Battle of Camlann) Mordred and the Great Dragon refer to Merlin by his Druidic name, Emrys (the Welsh form of Ambrosius); Abrosius Aurelianus was a historical figure whom Geoffrey of Monmouth partially merged with Merlin, Excalibur is an ordinary sword that becomes enchanted by the Great Dragon.

Cast are, (Merlin, ""Collin Morgan"") (Arthur, ""Bradley James"") (King Uther, ""Anthony Head"") (Morgana, ""Katie McGrath"") ( Gwen, ""Angel Coulby"") (Gaius,""Richard Wilson"") ( The Great Dragon, ""Voiced by John Hurt"") This series aired in 2008 in the UK and 2009 in the US season 3 is being filmed in England and in France.",1284681600,12,2289,4.763224181360202

First off, trousers? What is the costume department's aversion to hose? And, of course, a mishmash of centuries in the general garb of everyone, like a re-enactors festival. All right, it is about the Arthur legends and where does that really put it in terms of costumes, but pick a century already. Signs on the walls for people to read as well as letters written. Dear, dear. I suppose I don't mind so much the language used, a little updated for contemporary audiences, but with everything else, it's just too much. Why does it have to be so dumbed down?

3683216,5,B001LF347E,"After more than a 20 year hiatus, the BBC brings one of their shows to a major American network. Merlin is that show, and how very much worth the wait it was.

Based on Arthurian legends, Merlin is the story of a young man destined to become a great Sorcerer. Merlin, both blessed and cursed with incredible gifts of magic, is sent by his mother to the legendary Camelot to seek comfort and like-minded people. Once he arrives, he finds out that all magic has been banned from the kingdom by the cold-hearted King Uther Pendragon and anyone found practising will be immediately sentenced to death. He is taken in by Gaius, the Court physician, who quickly becomes his mentor. After saving the life of Uther's son, Arthur, Merlin is hired as the Prince's manservent. He quickly becomes echanted by the King's ward, the beautiful Lady Morgana (who has ""gifts"" of her own), and befriends her servent Guinevere. As the series progresses, Merlin becomes increasingly more powerful and it becomes difficult for him to hide his gifts from those around him. Only Gaius and the wise Great Dragon (behind held captive in the castle's dungeon, to whom Merlin often goes for wisdom and guidance) know his true self.

This is a beautifully shot, brilliantly scripted, wonderfully acted show. The actors are phenominal in their understated style and are all so very talented, and deliver their material flawlessly with immense grace, so much that you forget they are acting. The production value is superb (that is one awesome, fearful dragon). The story every week has heart, humor and shows the evolution of the characters in a poignant way. In every great legendary story is tragedy and heartbreak, and Merlin is no exception. Each character goes through a personal tragedy in some way, giving the show a serious Shakespearean quality.

Now, onto the DVD set itself. The transfers are high quality, meaning you get sharp & clear video and crisp audio. The packaging is standard (the cardboard ""booklet"" is a tri-fold and the show discs slightly overlap one another). The real gem about this set, however, are the special features! There are hours of fantastic featurettes featuring the entire cast in candid moments, in all stages of production. I honestly can't remember the last time I enjoyed features as much as these. I laughed out loud more times than I can count!

To summarize, if you haven't seen ""Merlin"" yet, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this DVD set. Take several hours and immerse yourself in a land of myth and a time of magic.",1284076800,4,2543,4.839080459770115

The only thing that would have made this DVD set better is an Episode book with pictures of the cast members with their names. Trust me you will want to know who they are.

Each show adds to the character depth and you can see how the experiences are changing Arthur and Merlin. They do not portray choices as simple black and white and mistakes are made with consequences. We find it interesting that both start out young as we are used to seeing Merlin (in other stories)as a much older. Our family watches this show together and first caught it on Scifi channel. I was quite happy to see Anthony Head (who we also loved as Giles) in a key role, albeit an imperfect king Uther. I personally like the fact that the female characters are also strong and not just damsels in distress.

I love the actors, the stories, the comedy, the special effects, superb job all around.  In particular, Colin Morgan as Merlin is fantastic and Anthony Head is someone you love to hate as Uther.  The Dragon made me laugh more than once - I just loved his attitude and I even understood his act of revenge at the end of Season 2.  I also REALLY like the way the Arthur/Gwen story has developed - Season 1, he didn't pay her any mind and you can tell there was a concerted effort to make Gwen as plain Jane as possible while Morgana was a stunning beauty.  Season 2, you notice that Gwen looks more attractive but Arthur doesn't notice the beauty, he notices the courage (when she saves his life) and her intelligence, spunk and wisdom when he stays in her home. The point is that the story of Arthur & Gwen always revolves around a love at first sight kind of meeting but I think the way the writers have chosen to tell the story, is more meaningful and a great twist on a timeless love story. A powerful and handsome man like Arthur can have any beauty in the land on his arm but as we see him grow from an arrogant boy into a more humble and considerate prince, his perspective about true beauty changes as well and I love it. They've managed to take Arthur from someone you'd despise in the first few episodes to someone you admire because he is kind and gentle, he has a good heart and is trying to learn how to be a benevolent ruler.

I was a little heartbroken when the BBC cancelled Robin Hood, which was great (five stars in my opinion) but am glad they have another period show on again.  Maybe at some point the USA will catch on and start making some tv shows that revolve around friendship, history/legend, and moral chivalry instead of sex and skinny, cranky girls...just saying.  Anyhow, it is about Merlin, a young magician and Prince Arthur, heir to Camelot.  You also get to meet Gwen, a ""serving girl"" of sorts, and Morgana, ward of King Uther, and Gaius, physician to the throne.  There is also a dragon that becomes Merlin's advisor sort of.  The relationships between characters in this show is what makes it endearing.  Gaius is looking after Merlin for his mother because magic and socery has been outlawed.  Merlin can't seem to not use it, but keeps it quiet.  However it seems Morgana also has the ""sight"" unbeknown to Merlin.  And the adventure begins!  For example: they save a young druid boy, fight a wraith, and find out what is magically poisoning the water supply of Camelot.  This show is light hearted and family oriented!

3683253,5,B001LF347E,"This needs to be prefaced with a warning.  If you cannot bear to see the Arthurian myth put in a blender on frappe, you will absolutely hate this.  Merlin and Arthur are the same age, Uther is still alive, Gwen is a black peasant girl, Morgana is Uther's ward and of no relation to Arthur at all, Mordred is a random Druid boy, and Lancelot is hispanic.  The costumes are anachronistic and the architecture is freaking Gothic.

That said, as a show all by itself, I am absolutely in love with Merlin.  Every single actor clearly loves his or her own character.  The inter-character chemistry is amazing and real.  There is humour enough for everyone.  The fighting scenes are imperfect and mysteriously lacking in any blood ever, but still good fun to watch.

So if you can put aside the original mythology and suspend disbelief, this is a fantastic series that I would recommend to anyone, and is appropriate for just about every age group.",1274140800,3,941,4.654545454545454

If you like stories about Merlin and Arthur you will probably enjoy this. My only complaint is no episode guide on the dvd. Hopefully they will correct that when the second season is finished.
 I enjoy the fight scenes and the ways they find for Merlin to help Arthur while still keeping his magical ability a secret.",1273795200,,629,4.330508474576271
3683255,5,B001LF347E,"I must say I really enjoyed these shows, which was a surprise, since I was skeptical at first. I was quite familiar with the Arthurian legend with both Arthur and Merlin portrayed as men at their prime time, meaning old Merlin and a grown up Arthur. So, the DVD cover centered on one skinny boy did not exactly look promising. Besides, all the lead actors/actresses were not familiar to me. But boy, was I surprised!

Once I started the first episode, the introductory line delivered by the Dragon, ""In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy. His name... Merlin"", with its musical background and flash scenes for the opening, picked my interest fast!

I learnt the basic characters were the same as what I knew from other Arthurian legend. It has Merlin, Arthur, Morgana, Uther Pendragon, Guinevere, Lancelot, Mordred and the Excalibur. But, Merlin in this BBC version have many differences like, a talking dragon who acted as Merlin's advisor, Merlin being the same age range as Arthur, Morgana as Uther's ward and in some ways, acted like Arthur's sister, and Guinevere who was a handmaiden to Morgana, instead of a born royalty, definitely an interesting different take from the usual version.

The main 4 casts were not familiar to me, maybe because they were not playing many shows, yet. That's one reason I think why I doubted them in the first place. But I found they were good actors with each episode to come. I think Colin Morgan was a perfect choice to play Merlin in this version. He could act smart, foolish, confused, annoying, upset and funny, anytime it required. Bradley James was athletically built and adequately agile to play a playful prince, who liked nothing more than to hunt and fight. He has a heavy timbre voice too, to suit the great future king. Angel Colby was able to portray a Guinevere, who wasn't born a royalty, yet she acted as honorable, kind and sometimes majestic, to suit a queenly character one day.  Katie McGarth played Morgana well, a girl with troubling dreams which turned out to be the sign of her growing magical power later.

We got to see how each character grew into maturity with each event they faced, especially Arthur and Merlin. The young prince Arthur in pilot episode was an all-too-common pompous spoiled boy; he then grew into a more thoughtful man, and became a loyal friend. I could imagine how great a king he would be later with more life experience he walked.

Merlin, on the other hand, started as a boy who was confused with his magical power, and had an immature self-pride for the power. Yet, with each episode to go, his childish pride gradually dissolved. He became more confident, and understood his great destiny entwined to Arthur. Of course, the two of them were still acting boyishly from time to time. Arthur still annoyed Merlin with his occasionally being a prat, and Merlin to Arthur, by his smart-ass comments all the time. And that was something I enjoyed much, because it made the show funny despite the dark danger they had to fight all the times.

The monster/danger in each episode might be felt as repetitive after some episodes. But it was okay, because the point of the show wasn't the monster. It was more about how all those adventures in overcoming the monster/danger building up Arthur and Merlin's relationship, from a mere servant and prince relationship, to solid friendship built on unwavering trust.",1273536000,2,3463,4.752079866888519
3683256,4,B001LF347E,"Merlin is a modernized version of the Arthurian legend. By modernized I mean they changed the characters dramatically from the old legend so that we, the people of the 21st century, can relate to and sympathize with. This show is definitely not for Arthurian purists, but it's an addictive fun watch for those of us who like to suck up to fantasy tales with handsome gallant princes and magical beasts.

Merlin the protagonist became the dorky dweeb with a kind and responsible heart instead of the all-wise, all-knowing old gray wizard we knew about. He's the your-average-geek with elvish ears, high cheekbones and mystical blue eyes. Prince Arthur is the typical kind of school bully, who also looks very much like a high school jock (although obviously much older), with record-setting sexist blond hair of any Arthur in any on-screen I've ever seen (and believe me I've seen quite a lot). Morgana is the fashionista with attitude, or, in modern terms, the perfect feminist; she's beautiful, she's a fighter, and she's not afraid to speak her mind and constantly go against daddy tyranny (what girl wouldn't look up to her?) and finally Guinevere is the down-to-earth schoolgirl who also can stand up for herself. Lancelot is the down-to-earth sweet guy that'd be your kind of perfect date.

So basically, the addiction comes from the fact that we see these kinds of people every day. It's almost the Merlin version of Shrek, slightly less cheesy. But the good news is that these actors all know what they're doing. The cast is composed of mostly brand-newcomers but they are indeed very talented, especially Colin Morgan (who plays Merlin), and Bradley James (who plays Arthur), both of them thankfully have most of the screen-time. As the show moves on we discover that Merlin isn't as geeky as he looks, and Arthur can very much be princely when it matters. Those two steals the show, and their chemistry--some call it gay some call it bromance--however you interpret it, is torching.

The older cast is not bad either. Dear Giles from Buffy turns into his dark side. But you can't quite state whether he is good or evil. Mostly what you can say is he's ""wavering"" like any sort of politician with massive power. Gaius became the mentor of the show, not only mentoring Merlin but Uther also. Well, you always need a good mentor to get the show going, I guess.

The show is with many plot holes, something they need to work on for future seasons. but season two is definitely better in terms of character development--their strongest quality with this show

So with all that's said, I'm going to start the ""rant""--the one thing that I think the show can do without:
The cast choice of Gwen
The problem:
I'm sorry to say this but Angel Coulby is really a miscast. Casting her as the future queen of England is wrong on so many levels that it's distracting to say the least. Many have complained that the actress is, let's face it, simply not attractive to match for the magazine model Arthur. Some people have tried to defend her by accusing perfectionist--that it's good that they casted people without perfect looks. Puh-leaze, why then make Arthur a hottie? Other people say she is pretty you're just used to European beauty. Even if that's true (believe me it's not, she wouldn't have been any prettier if she were white), it's still such a pain to have to hypnotize myself into denial of her (un)beauty.
  But I do have to say that this is not the main problem I have with her. My problem is the fact that the maker of the show is trying to do the overkill Cinderella story (which in my opinion is not only a naive way of looking at relatinships, but believe me it never works) WITH race. They casted a whitest white guy you could find, with blond hair blue eyes, and attempt to match her with a black girl. The whole message is literally screaming out: ""hey look! WE ARE NOT RACIST! and oh, if you even dare say anything bad about the cast choice, you are just a racist!"" This REALLY isn't necessary, every time I look at Gwen the first thought that popped into my head is not her unattractiveness, but ""HEY THERE WEREN'T ANY BLACK PEOPLE IN MEDIEVAL GREAT BRITAIN!!!"" Making Guinevere a black girl is as ridiculous as making her Asian, or Native American, or Indian. What's worse is that, if the writers follow the original Arthur tale with Arthur and Guinevere and Lancelot, which they do seem to, Guinevere will eventually betray Arthur after their marriage. Then the whole racism issue simply backfires.
  I have mentioned above regarding disdain of the Cinderella story that the writers chose with Arthur and Gwen and that it's a naive look of relationship (as many re-tellings of the Cinderella story have pointed out). Why? because realistically speaking, relationships last longer when the two people have more things in common than the commonly misguided and false stereotype: ""the opposite attracts."" Because youth/beauty, passion, and romance will eventually die out, and what's left is partnership. If the husband and the wife can help each other out in career and in family life, the relationship tends to last longer. Which is why people from different social classes rarely will get along, especially not back then when the gap is so huge--Princess Diana ring any bell? And surprise the blackness of Gwen landed her a maid. In fact, I predicted that this is what the writers are going to use for an explanation of the break-up between Gwen and Arthur, and we are all suppose to sympathize with them-that when they are married the reason why Gwen ran away with Lancelot is because Arthur had to always put country first and she would feel out of place. Which can only make it even more cliched and unbearable. In fact, this is the reason why the romance between Arthur and Gwen is such a forward leap and unconvincing to say the least, as many have already pointed out. Do they really have ANY common language or chemistry? I think not.

Yes yes I know it's just a show and not historic documentary, it's still not an excuse, and I still have my freedom of expression, so deal with it.

Overall it's an enjoyable show, and if what I pointed out above is not something that bothers you, all the better.",1273449600,15,6226,4.707988980716253
3683257,4,B001LF347E,"Much in the vein of the currently-popular franchise ""re-boot"" idea, Merlin: The Complete First Season continues this idea by re-inventing the traditional Arthurian legends for a newer, younger audience. In this BBC production, the typical, white-haired ""old man"" version of Merlin is traded in for a young boy learning about his magic and his destiny.

Merlin (Colin Morgan) is a naturally gifted warlock who is sent to live with Gaius (Richard Wilson), the physician in the court of Uther Pendragon (Anthony Head), king of Camelot. However, Uther has become a tyrant and prosecutes anyone and anything associate with magic. Uther's only small joy rests in his son, the famous Arthur (Bradley James) who, in this show, is depicted as an arrogant and reckless, yet well-meaning youth that always manages to get into trouble (and Merlin has to save him) . After saving Arthur's life, Merlin becomes his personal manservant, and thus begins Merlin's journey to realize his destiny as a powerful warlock and protector and friend to Arthur. Merlin and Arthur are joined in their journey by Morgana (Katie McGrath), the king's ward, and her maidservant Guinevere ""Gwen"" (Angel Coulby).

The plotlines for about the first half of the series seem to blur together. Each episode feels like a repeat of the last, following the same formula: a stranger shows up claiming to be someone they are not, Merlin uncovers the true and wants to use magic to fix it, when Merlin confronts others about the truth no one believes him, Merlin eventually saves the day with magic secretly, and Arthur typically gets the credit. The characters also felt very flat in these episodes, with little development and little relationship growth. The only thing that got me through these episodes were the high production values (the BBC doesn't skimp) and the fun, adventure aspect of the show.

Thankfully, the second half of the season really picks up. Plotlines grow more complex, characters grow deeper and the show takes a darker turn that drew me in. It becomes apparent that the first half of the season was meant to be exposition, and the writers finally got to a point where they could grow legs under their show. In particular, Morgana takes unexpected turns that pulls viewers in and makes them question everything they've learned about the world of Merlin.

The oddest thing about the American distribution of Merlin is the fact that it aired on NBC on Sunday nights. Sure, it was picked up during the summer, likely to be a filler show during the off months, but I thought it an odd choice and an odd time slot, but figured that NBC was hoping that Merlin could pull some of the Doctor Who fans and possible enjoy cult status -plus it's family-friendly. Unfortunately, NBC didn't pick up season two, but SyFy did, and is currently airing it. A third season is currently in the works from the BBC.

Bonus features in this five-disc set include episode commentary, two in-depth making of featurettes, video diaries from some of the cast while filming the series, photo galleries and wallpapers. While I found that this was a worthwhile collection of extras, I was hoping for something a little more -like deleted scenes from certain episodes, or an exploration of the original Aruthurian legends and how they are different/similar to the series.

Merlin is offered in complete surround-sound stereo, which really comes in handy during the action sequences. Surprisingly though, only English subtitles and English language audio track is available, which will probably disappoint fans with alternative language preferences.

While the show does have some shortfalls, it's a fun adventure that'll keep audiences of all ages entertained. The second half of the season proves that Merlin is filled with potential to grow into a powerful show filled with magic, depth and amazingly complex character.",1273017600,3,3874,5.04375
3683258,5,B001LF347E,"There is just something about this show that never fails to put a smile on my face. The interactions of the characters/actors are so wonderful and they have such obvious chemistry, you can't help but adore them. Often, in a story of this genre (especially with TV shows), I would be concerned about the risk of cheese factor, melodramatic dialogue, etc. but Merlin falls victim to none of the standard problems. The writing is clever and mature, the direction and visuals lovely, the costume and set design fantastic and the performances are just superb.

To be honest, I watched the pilot of this series expecting not to care for it. So when I ended up getting completely hooked within the first 15 minutes (from Merlin and Arthur's first meeting), it was a truly welcomed surprise. Yes, some drastic changes were made from the original legends...Merlin is actually a couple of years younger than the prince rather than old man with a long beard, and becomes his incredibly cheeky personal servant. Arthur starts out as an arrogant jackass who likes to give poor Merlin a hard time while still becoming close to him, which makes their relationship both entertaining and endearing. The future queen Gwen is thus far a servant girl to the Lady Morgana, and the romance between her and Arthur is slowly and believably developed...and so on and so forth. However, it doesn't matter that they've taken creative liberties with the story - the fact is, they've done it extremely well. It's very tastefully constructed and while a unique approach to the ancient story, manages to hold true to it in its own way.

The one and only thing lacking in this show is the special effects when it comes to any monsters or magical creatures, which are fairly low budget and old school. However, I'm able to easily get past that aspect since everything else is so very well done and they don't overdo the monsters, so it's not too often that it's brought to your attention. Everything else feels like a high budget epic.

As for the DVD release itself...it's a must-have if you want to be as entertained by the cast members as by the characters they play. The many commentaries, behind-the-scenes features and especially the cast diaries are not to be missed...they will make you envious that you weren't there to join in the fun. The bottom line? This box set is absolutely worth your money, so go for it.",1272326400,3,2388,4.749397590361446

3683260,4,B001LF347E,"I'd say that this series is a replacement for the other Medieval-era BBC production ""Robin Hood"" that was cancelled after its 3rd season.  That said, it's not bad, (minus the less than stellar CG effects.)  I caught a couple episodes of Season 1 on the SyFy Channel during a pre-Season 2 marathon, and despite the low budget CG effects, the production values of the rest of the show like the costume and set department is not bad.  Acting is also pretty good too, but not quite as good as say the Robin Hood series, but acceptable, from what I've seen.

But I will say this though...why is it is that all these shows like this, always go the teen-age angst route?  Can we not have adult-driven genre shows like this?  A darker adult Camelot action-adventure/drama would be interesting.  And spending a bit more on the CG effects.  At least on par with the series ""Legend of the Seeker"".

So, assuming the US release will be the same, this DVD not only contains 13 exceptionally good episodes but lots and lots of interesting extra features that will bring you up close and personal with the utterly CHARMING stars of this great show.

I say great, because season 1 of Merlin (comparing it to the other recent family-friendly BBC shows that I've seen) is orders of magnitude better than Robin Hood, and solidly better than season 1 of Doctor Who. The stories, while not especially complex, are very entertaining and colorful, and the fresh, young actors are all really fantastic finds. I would say that Bradley James as Arthur slightly edges out the rest to be the best of the lot, and Colin Morgan is so fascinating you can't take your eyes off him. The writing is fast and witty with lots of humor and some surprising depth. And the castle is real!

So, season 1 of Merlin is most definitely worth buying, keeping, and watching more than once.

Oh, but wait until you see what's coming next! Also via Amazon UK I also have Merlin season 2. And if season 1 is great, season 2 is utterly fantastic!! I won't say too much or give anything away, but I will say this: they chose the right actors. Because season 2 pushes every character to extremes far beyond season 1 and all of them rise to it magnificently. Absolutely one of the best shows I've ever seen. And good news!

3683266,5,B001LF347E,This is by far one of the best TV series I have seen in a very long time. It quickly draws you into the relationship between Merlin and Arthur. You begin to see how one person can influence another for good over the long haul (and Arthur needs it)! The relationship between Merlin and Gaius is also delightful to watch. These three actors are phenomenal and certainly carry the show. The sets are amazingly authentic...you feel like you are right there in the middle of it all. For a TV show it is certainly beyond what I have come to expect and is great family entertainment (except for young children due to some scary themes/scenes).,1265760000,,636,4.539130434782609
3683267,4,B001LF347E,"It's like I've said before for another review: this show is in the vein of the family-friendly fantasy shows which are meant to entertain and not educate.  If you like fantasy and liked Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Xena Warrior Princess, and the BBC Robin Hood series, chances are you'll like Merlin.

If you read reviews saying this show isn't historically accurate or doesn't comply with Arthurian legend, take those with a grain of salt.  This show isn't meant to be a scholarly work or documentary of Arthurian legend - it's a fun interpretation of Camelot meant to entertain and it's very well done and thoroughly entertaining IMO.  I'm not saying it's perfect.  The first few episodes tend to rely on the ""villain of the week"" plots that Smallville used to do (makes sense since creator Johnny Capps admitted that Smallville was this show's initial inspiration).  However, the first season finds its footing fairly quickly and eventually moves away from the Smallville formula and into laying the groundwork for telling its own story arcs.  The episodes and storylines become richer as the show hints at the classic Camelot stories that will eventually come to be - Mordred, Lancelot, Excalibur, and of course Morgan le Fay but she's called Morgana here.  There are a few weaknesses (the often-cheesy CGI monsters) but there's a great deal of humor and wonderful acting from a cast mostly made up of unknowns (save for UK acting veterans Anthony Head and Richard Wilson).  The sets, music, costumes and overall production are well done and none of it is ever boring (though some episodes are better than others).

But best of all is the wonderfully hilarious but often sweet relationship between the characters of Arthur (Bradley James) and Merlin (Colin Morgan).  Both characters are really fun to watch in a older bullying brother/geeky kid brother kind of vibe.  Bradley James and Colin Morgan have absolutely great chemistry together and really make the characters extremely likable and you just can't help but root for them (well, root for Merlin anyway...Arthur takes a bit longer as you'll see once you watch the pilot).  I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't watched yet, but watch for an absolutely classic scene in one of the episodes where Arthur tries to, er, get Merlin to eat something he doesn't want to eat and hilarity ensues.

Speaking of comedy, I'm reviewing this before getting the dvds (obviously since they're not out till April) so I don't know if the US version dvds will have the episode commentary extras that the UK dvds had.  I really hope so but we may be disappointed on that front, which would stink being that the four main young cast commented on ""The Moment of Truth"" and it is so, so funny!  Bradley James was particularly hilarious:

Colin:  I had to sit so close to that fire, my lips got burnt.
Bradley:  That's why we had to draw on Colin's eyebrows later.  (HAHAHAHA!)

Bottom line: really a very fun show and worth watching.",1264464000,6,2996,4.858267716535433

Each episode grabbed your interest from the very beginning and kept it throughout. The commercials were unbearable for me so I'll really enjoy seeing this again when it is released on DVD. I enjoyed the absence of modern day programs with their swear words and sexual inuendos. This program was a pure pleasure to watch. I feel it was pure fantasy and pure fun. I would advise parents to watch with their kids to explain Merlin's magic. Thanks BBC for this program, thanks NBC for airing it!",1252886400,,738,4.394160583941606
3683273,4,B001LF347E,"I am in the U.S. so I watched this whole season online...At first, I must admit, what lured me are the three young, good looking characters (Morgana, Arthur, Merlin).  The story was O.K.  It was more like a Smallville for Arthurian legend, and I hate those type of shows.  Then as I watched it, it began to stick with me.  And the characters and the character relationships began to morph into something more real.

Some things that bothered me though is the fact that all these powerful magical people were killed by mere mortals when they could do wondrous things with magic.  Like in one of the episodes a sorceress was in a crowd while her son was executed.  She came out and cursed Uther and then disappeared in a tornado.  If she could do that, why let puny mortals behead her son to begin with?!  That was always a little frustrating.  Also, what is frustrating, is Arthur.  Well the actor who plays Arthur.  He is hunky but seems REALLY prissy and proud.  He portrays what Arthur is supposed to be like in this series very well (a spoiled brat), but perhaps he does it a little TOO well...Same with Merlin.  But in the opposite fashion.  Merlin is supposed to be this powerful ancient wizard, yet in this series he is shy, quiet and runs around like a maid.  I don't know if I like these twists.

The special effects are fine.  They definitely aren't big budget Hollywood effects, but they are like normal television special effects.

I guess my major complaint is that there needs to be a bit more depth to the character and story.  It needs to begin taking form.  Uther needs to die, like really soon. Merlin and Arthur need to begin getting closer.  Morgana needs to begin getting more powerful and cruel.",1252368000,5,1716,4.521172638436482
3683274,4,B001LF347E,"I confess that when I first heard of this BBC import I had no intention of watching it. For starters, it deviated too far from the standard Arthurian legends. And when I heard about CG dragons and pseudo-medieval costuming I decided it would be a total dud.

I couldn't have been more wrong. The series is absolutely delightful, in spite of minor flaws like occasionally sketchy plots and dialogue. It was clearly aimed at young viewers--perhaps the early to mid-teen set--but surprise, surprise! It has garnered a devoted adult following, to which I now belong. A lot of this is due to the charm of the (mostly youthful) cast, a bunch of attractive newcomers who overcome the periodic silliness of the storylines with their genuine acting chops and ability to swashbuckle with just the right amount of aplomb combined with humor. A degree of gravitas is provided by Richard Wilson as the court physician Gaius and Anthony Head as a narrow-minded, stern (nay, hard-assed!) King Uther Pendragon, and John Hurt, who voices the clairvoyant old dragon chained beneath Uther's castle at Camelot. But the lead actors--Colin Morgan as young Merlin and Bradley James as Prince Arthur--undoubtedly steal the show.

In this non-conventional take on Camelot, Prince Arthur is something of an arrogant bully with a heart of gold, who becomes genuinely fond of and dependant upon Merlin, the gawky, bumbling, admittedly adorable youth he takes as a manservant. What he doesn't yet know is that Merlin is a gifted sorcerer, who must conceal his abilities because King Uther has outlawed (on pain of death) the practice of any form of magic. In spite of the royal ban, it is Merlin's destiny--as Gaius and the imprisoned dragon repeatedly assure him--to look after Arthur, protect him from harm, and make certain that he survives the sniping of his enemies to become king of Camelot someday. The job isn't always a picnic; Arthur can be a pain in the royal butt at times, and his prowess as a warrior places him in constant danger. Merlin (whose blue eyes turn CG gold when he performs magic) is periodically aided by other inhabitants of Camelot, most specifically Morgana (Katie McGrath), Uther's beautiful ward, and Guinevere, known as Gwen (Angel Coulby), who is Morgana's maid. All in all the cast appears to to having a grand old time with this morphed rendition of the King Arthur story, and they clearly have an excellent chemistry with one another. As the New York Times quipped, this is Camelot in the Age of Obama: commoners and nobles address each other by their first names and Guinevere is a servant, not a princess, and is played by a lovely actress of mixed ethnic background. Best of all, Merlin and Arthur are perfect foils for one another in looks and in character. The slim, angular Mr. Morgan, with his lanky grace, black hair, elvish ears and changeable blue eyes gives us a Merlin who is by turns comical, serious, and intense, shy yet self-assertive in the face of Arthur's bullying. Mr. James, a classically handsome blond with mobile features, pouty rock-and-roll lips, and an athletic physique, plays Arthur as a spoiled princeling with a sense of entitlement, who nevertheless clearly cares about his subjects and hides a kindness and compassion beneath an arrogant exterior.

As the mother of a teenager who adores the show, it has been a (guilty) pleasure for me to watch this series unfold. I look forward to a second season. When a U.S.-compatible DVD set is issued, I hope it includes the cast's video diaries from the British DVD release. These ""diaries,"" which contain some hilarious escapades (both on and off set) featuring the young actors, as well as moments of highly amusing banter between Mr. James and Mr. Morgan, and Mr. James and Ms. Coulby, are definitely worth a watch.",1252368000,30,3801,4.899068322981367
3683275,2,B001LF347E,"Well - where to begin?  I suppose that after you watch the first few episodes it begins to occur to you that all the main characters are slightly stupid.  In fighting a flying monster they try to use swords and spears instead of crossbows for example.  They never seem to learn from one episode to the next and always make the same basic mistakes regarding misjudging appearances and each other.  There is no real growth or progression in the relationships or maturity of the younger characters and the older ones are so inflexible and foolish that it strains all credulity.  Great liberties are taken with the original Arthurian myth so one finds Guinevere a serving maid, for example!  Their attitudes are completely modern and speech likewise makes it hard to place them from anywhere else than 21st century London.  Basic plot of an episode will be a stranger shows up who will pretend to be something they aren't in order to get at the royal family.  The king is oblivious, despite having this happen repeatedly, to the idea that somebody might use a disguise or lie to deceive him.  Merlin tries to warn him, not believed, ends up having to use magic to save the day.

It may not be THE-ABSOLUTE-BEST-THING-EVER-ON-TV-EVER!!, but this UK import is pretty darn good.  Solid 4 stars.  I started watching the first couple on Hulu, and now I'm sort of hooked.  I'm usually a wait-to-see-it-on-Hulu person, but I've been flipping on my TV Sunday nights to help get the Nielsen ratings up.  I hope this show isn't cancelled, at least they finished out season 1 in the UK!  Looking forward to season 2 (i hope!!) and to seeing what these promising actors will do after this!

So, 4 stars for giving me hope in scripted, serialized TV.  Thank you, BBC.

3683278,3,B001LF347E,"All in all I enjoyed this first season quite a lot.
Professionally scripted, filmed and acted, it heavily relies on the charm of the Arthurian myth and on the free use of magic so fashionable these years providing the viewer with hours of easy entertainment. A little TOO easy at times.
Said viewer could be even a child of about 10 if a parent were there to do some explaining.

That the main purpose of this series be entertainment is perfectly legitimate, but I am convinced that things could and should have been done better even within this limited scope.

First and foremost there are heavy qualitative differences in the 13 episodes: scripted and directed by different people they are remarkably different in achievements. Take for instance the episode before the last: throughout there is great attention paid to lighting, to framing and composition. The result is that this episode is vastly superior from every point of view. And it shows, it really does. Why was this attention not paid to all of them?
Another irritating problem is the actors' diction: in the first episode it is very theatrical, cristal clear, perfect. Elsewhere, but not everywhere, the same actors slur whole sentences forcing me to use subtitles. Why? Have the creators not established guidelines?
They should have. The series is full of inconsistencies (and sketchy plots/characterization/ethics). For example at the start Merlin is said to be capable of making spells with no mouthed incantation. Elsewhere he has to speak just to open a closed door. Sorry, but these mistakes irritate me a lot.

To talk about some inconsistencies forces me to introduce others that may be less relevant if one accepts that this series was originally meant for entertainment only. I can see that it might as well be only me who wishes for more attention to be paid to details.
The Arthurian myth is extraordinarily confused but if I am not wrong the life of Arthur is supposed to be set in the first centuries A.D. when the Roman army was retiring from Britain and the Latin-Celtic world was collapsing into small states, often at war with each other and facing the first waves of the Anglo-Saxon invasion.
I might be wrong but this series seems to be set much later, when Anglo-Saxons were already established and mixed with the rest: Arthur's father is called Uther, for instance, and there are runes -which are Germanic only- everywhere. I am under the impression that most incantations are pronounced in Old English instead of some kind of Celtic. Camelot itself is an enormous, full fledged castle, something I would expect in the X century or even later and several details in the scenes appear to be wrong.
Another point is the choice of black actors. Those playing Gwen and her father especially, but there were quite a lot of extras too.
Do NOT misunderstand me: they are fine professionals, I loved them, but I somehow doubt that in V century Britain there were so many people of colour, not to mention among the knights.
A further point is that the dialogues/gestures and even ethics sound too modern for the time. Was this really necessary for entertainment's sake? Was it not possible to fetch an historian and have him revise the production while preserving the fun?

There are several other points I could make but I shall leave it to you to decide for yourself; allow me to stress that a little more accuracy would have been welcomed.
Some less sketchy dialogues would have been too: all actors do a decent job and could surely afford better lines and deeper ethics/attitudes.

An interesting issue other reviewers have pointed out are the homosexual undertones in the series, especially -and understandably- in the relationship between Arthur and Merlin. Nothing for prudes to worry about though, there is nothing explicit as there is nothing sexual of any sort in any line of the script for any character in the whole first season. It is just a feeling.",1245715200,,3940,4.857142857142857

Historically unbelievable.  it's a bit too modern to be the barbaric truth of our history as human beings. but if you weren't trying to make it match up accurately to the time period, then no harm done!  if so, though, you butchered it.

 Even with just the first few episodes, i can give you a list of what WOULDN'T happen  back then:  'bout the only accurate thing was the king's decision to kill an innocent man because he was believed to have  ""magic."" beyond that,

  -  i doubt a prince would have very good fighting skills; that's the job of his body guards.
-  the breast-plate on the prince's  armor DOESN'T protect the heart; might as well not have it & just have the chain mail as it's too high up to cover the heart fully, and is even less on Aurther's left side  of his chest than there is on the right,  I think their outfitters forgot which side the heart was on.  had it been flip-flopped the ""right"" way, it would still rise too highly and not protect the heart all the way, much less the lungs.
-  i highly doubt the daughter (or whoever she was) would have lived after she insulted the king and stood up to him.  back then, people were just slaughtered for that and if a woman EVER  spoke her mind, she was brutally murdered. but being the princess, she would have probably been given a sentence of imprisonment and severe, prolonged torture instead of death.  as opposed to the scenario of  ""pulling a few strings"" that may have made you question if  a spell was done to free Merlin, (Despite the impression his savior did not study magic.)  it makes a bit more sense than in the case with the princess, who had no magic to influence the king with.",1515456000,,1822,4.445454545454545
