It is a great moral tale. A tale which  seems to tell us that good things come to those who are kind and giving  even in poverty, and also that promises and deals must be kept. Definitely  well filmed, and can't get enough of those cute little demons. A must have  for anyone who love fantasy. A STORY SHORT is also a great tragic story for  our hero the STORYTELLER full of magic and humor, dealing with gambling,  lying, modesty, and kindness. I too have been waiting a very long time for  this series to come on video. Please put more episodes on video.",938131200,3,734,4.27536231884058

7913081,5,B00000JQAC,"I echo everything that has been said prior to this comment on this inparticular videocassette which features two great episodes from this timeless show.  I greatly remember the first episode (The Prince and Death...or something like that).

I first saw the show on TV (around the age of 7 or 8), and I got severely scared of the devils in the sack with the Prince captures.  I dunno...maybe just me, but the horrific realism of the entire show got to me in such a way that, at that age, I knew that Henson was doing something original and miraculous with the stories he told.

I kind of remember the second episode on this tape, but I just had to throw that comment out there about the first episode.

You can pick up the DVD at a number of online sources (including amazon.com, of course).",1143763200,,790,4.458333333333333
7913082,5,B00000JQAC,"In the course of what must now be almost 20 years since I saw Jim Henson's adaptions of fairy tales for the first time, they have lost none of their appeal to me - something, I should perhaps add, that also rings true for most of other Henson's work, ranging from 'Sesame Street', 'The Muppets Show' to 'The Dark Crystal'. Among the twelve episodes of 'The Storyteller' (nine fairy tales, three Greek myths), 'The Soldier and Death' has a special place in my heart, not least thanks to the ranks of rather cute devils that have 'muppet' written all over them. While it is a pity that to this very day there is, indeed, no RC1 dvd edition available, it may be of interest to afficionados that in the Netherlands 4 dvd featuring all 12 episodes were released. While the release by 'Bridge Entertainment' suffers from notable defects in sound & picture quality (the dvds seem to have been mastered from VHS material), to my knowledge it offers what is currently the only chance to view one of the best childrens' series that ever were in their entirety. While I do hope to see the day on which the episodes of 'The Storyteller' get the dvd treatment they deserve, I'll keep on watching my old tapes as I have done for years ... and recommending 'The Soldier and Death' and all other available episodes of 'The Storyteller' to old and new Jim Henson fans alike.",1053302400,4,1357,4.542857142857143
7913083,5,B00000JQAC,"Superb! I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Jim Henson's muppet creations, as well as good children's fairy tales (I must admit I enjoy these myself, and I am now 38 years old...!).
I only wish the missing episodes were available. The very best thing, would be the whole collection in a DVD Box Set...!!!",1014076800,9,313,4.607142857142857
7913084,5,B00000JQAC,"Even though the show was only around for just about one season, Jim Henson's ""The Storyteller"" was one of my favorite shows growing up. I was fascinated by the tales told on the show and a few of the stories left a deep impression upon me; I've always said that Jim Henson was one of only a few directors who could film a fairy tale right.
My favorite of all the shows was ""The Soldier and Death"". This episode was based upon an old Russian folk tale. The story deals with a kind, young soldier walking back home on his way from war. Due to a few kind deeds the soldier performs, he is given a magical sack; a ruby whistle; and a magic deck of cards. He uses all of those gifts to the utmost. The tale has several morals, but unfortunately ends rather sadly for the hero.
""A Short Story"" was another episode I remember fondly. It is a story about the Storyteller's own life and adventures. It is reminiscent of ""1001 Tales of Scherazade"" in some aspects. However, the story takes place in Europe, not Arabia and there is a major twist.
Jim Henson was one of the most gifted filmmakers of our time. Perhaps exceeding the accomplishments of ""The Muppet Show"", ""The Storyteller"" was a groundbreaking series full of excitement, fun, morals, and lots of good stories. They just don't make television like that anymore.",1013385600,6,1313,4.497907949790795
7913085,5,B00000JQAC,"These two series done by Hensen for HBO are both masterpieces! The reviewer is incorrect in the number of episodes though. The first storyteller series is 9 episodes and the Greek Myth is 4. So we have 5 episodes still missing and I would love to see this whole series on DVD! Just so beautifully done I wish we could have had more episodes.
Just like Shelly Duval's Faire Tale Theater these shows have humore, whit and don't make the story just for children!",1010620800,,459,4.476190476190476
7913086,5,B00000JQAC,"Ya'll, the Soldier and death is one of THE most phenominal pieces Jim Henson EVER created.  This story has been with me since I was 8 years old (okay, that was really only a decade ago, but whatever)and I am still totally awed by it.  GET THIS VIDEO.  I haven't even gotten it in my mail yet, and I CANNOT wait to watch A story Short, which I have never seen.  HOW EXCITING!!",1002672000,,375,4.095890410958904
7913087,5,B00000JQAC,"Jim Henson's Storyteller is a brilliant series. John Hurt is fabulous, as always, and his dog is a delight. I haven't seen any of the greek myths, yet, but if Derek Jacobi is in at least one them, then I am sure that they must be wonderful. I must say, that I'm a little disappointed to see that John Hurt was replaced by a different actor (I can't really imagine anyone else in his role), but not having seen the Greek incarnations, I really can not judge them, and they are probably very good in their own right. They certainly appear to have recruited top-notch actors. The Storyteller episodes with John Hurt are absolutely wonderful. These are fairy tales the way they were meant to be told. They are witty and sagacious, and thoroughly entertaining. They are not whitewashed, and the endings aren't always happy. The Soldier and Death is probably my favorite (the card game with the devils is classic!).  I remember watching this series when I was in highschool, in Canada. The Storyteller was broadcast at the tail end of the Jim Henson Hour (and was, by far, the best part of the show). Unfortunately, I have never had the opportunity to view the series in its entirety. I've seen Sapsorrow and The Soldier & Death, and another one called the Three Ravens (which is equally wonderful!). I am overjoyed to discover that some of the episodes have been transferred to video! Unfortunately, it seems that there are about 4 or 5 others that are STILL unavailable! Does anyone out there know why the others have not yet been released, and/or if there are any plans to release them at a future date? Judging by the copyrights and viewer comments, it looks as though a couple of years have passed, without any move, on the part of the studio, to do so.  At any rate, these tapes are well worth purchasing. In my view, they are Henson's best work (and I love the muppets, just so you know).",993686400,14,1889,4.552941176470588
7913088,5,B00000JQAC,"I remember seeing The Storyteller when I was younger and thinking it was just about the greatest show around. Now many years later, I think I was  pretty close to hitting the mark.
I still remember most of the details of  the story of The Soldier and Death. Something about the way the story was  crafted and the imagery that was used just stuck out in my memory. I tried  to discuss the show with some of my peers, but no one ever seemed to have  heard of it. I looked around for it everywhere, but no one had it. If  you've never seen this show, or if you have and have the same fond memories  of it as I do, then I highly recommend purchasing these tapes. Thanks  Amazon, I can stop searching now!",965174400,,700,4.133333333333334
7913089,5,B00000JQAC,"After 12 years of hearing about how wonderful The Storyteller was, and not being able to find it for rent, I decided to take a chance and buy it. My family just watched it and is clamouring for me to buy the next one  immediately! Definitely lived up to the hype and my expectations.",946080000,3,283,4.2407407407407405
