""D'Agostino"" ""A Very Strange Engrossing Film"" by film critic  Amos Lassen... ""I had just finished watching Jorge Ameer's newest film and honestly I did not know what to think about it except that it had totally pulled me in. So I played in a second time and found myself completely absorbed by it. It is quite basically a tale of horror which later becomes something else altogether so I suppose I have to say it is macabre to a point but it is so much more than that. Allen Dawson inherited an apartment in Santorini, Greece. He learned that his grandmother willed it to him but he had to go to Greece to take care of the property transfer. He discovers a human clone in the apartment and decides that it or D'Agostino (who he nicknames Diablo) is to become his new best friend even though the only human quality that the clone possesses is his appearance.

We learn that the clone had been on a transatlantic voyage from Italy to America when there was a crash and he had been left for dead. He had been commissioned by men with wealth and was to be used for organ transplants but he had been abandoned. In the meantime, Dawson learns of his inheritance and leaves his home which he had been sharing with his girlfriend and goes to Santorini where he finds the abandoned clone. Through Diablo, Dawson comes to learn more about himself as he decides to make the clone his best friend. Dawson also realizes that his relationship with his fiance is a sham and that it is going nowhere and he is bored with and upset that he gets nothing out of it. He realizes that he is trapped in a sedentary existence and that his prospects for future happiness do not look good so when he receives news of the inheritance he knows that he has a chance to get away from his him-drum life and travels to Greece alone. He understands that his life has been little more than an obstruction but he is also not quite ready to deal with what he finds. He quickly sees that with his new property his outlook on life changes and then changes once again when he meets D'Agostino.

At first Dawson s befuddled by the clone and has no idea of how to deal with him but as the two interact we see that his state of mind becomes quite strange and he becomes both ruthless and cruel but as he gets to know the clone, we watch him become victim to his own moral perversion which later creates a reaction that causes him to fall victim to his actions. How and what that is will be something for you to discover when you see the film and regardless of what I say, there is no way to prepare the viewer for what he sees.

The cinematography was beautiful and Greece of course leads itself to creating beauty on the screen. Yet when the film is dark, it is very dark. Hats off to the actors who play Dawson and the clone and to Ameer himself in his performance as the man who has been watching the property. I cannot say that this is a film I enjoyed but I can say that it is well done. Enjoy just does not seem the right word to describe it. If you get the chance to see this film, do not hesitate.""

I've never heard of a film to be dedicated to a pet, yet Ameer dedicates his film to his cat.. interestingly named after him. I've heard of people leaving their wealth to their pet, but not a film.  I guess money runs out but film are like diamonds, they last forever.  Anyhow,  you can see this gut wrenching documentary tribute on the imdb page of the film.  Make sure you have lots of kleenex cause you'll need em.... all in all, a great film to have within your collection.  After you've watch the tribute, you'll definitely want to see the film.  The visuals of Santorini in ""D'Agostino""  were so stunningly beautiful, I'm booking my trip to Greece for next summer!!!",1361232000,5,3754,4.307801418439716

Dark in content and the way it was filmed worked together fairly well. Politically correct would not be a term I would use on some of the remarks and actions.

First, it is an unrealistic premise with poorly casted actors. A beautifully handsome leading man with an absolute troll for a wife and a story line that never even remotely addresses it narrative purpose.

I am appalled that a human being would treat antoher living creature, clone or whatever, in such a demeaning way. Now, at least, I see why white men enslaved blacks, they thought it was their privledge. Sad, but true.

It is very uncomfortable watching him physically and emotionally abusing another person throughout the film. The directing and editing of this film seem very amateurish, much of it playing like a bad travelogue.  The script is usually adequate and the two male leads are satisfactory. The actress who plays the wife is horribly miscast, both in her age and appearance. I believe the director plays an on-going minor character and he is very wooden and stilted.

I watched a total of 52 minutes of the 117 (oh and there was bonus material too, oh joy) before I could stomach no more.  The acting was abysmal, the dialogue was ridiculous, the story line had no reason to it and made no sense what so ever.  The sound was patchy at best and even the scenery shots, of which there were many, were flat and colorless.  Which is a pretty incredible feat since Greece is simply stunning.  In a word, TERRIBLE!  I attempted to give this no stars however Amazon insisted I check at least one of them to submit this review. I'm wondering if Jorge Ameer has some peculiar fascinations with inhuman treatment and some money to burn.

If ANYONE ponders renting this catastrophe pass it by, or better yet burn every copy.",1369267200,2,847,4.532894736842105

5615884,4,B00BG474P8,"This film is weird but interesting. It is: a fantasy horror story, a cautionary tale about technology, an allegory of modern life, and a love story of sorts. Whatever it is, it held my attention, and the backgrounds in Greece are lovely.  The actors do a more than credible job, particularly Michael Angels who spends most of the movie nude and non-speaking except for ape-like sounds.",1367971200,3,385,4.833333333333333
5615885,1,B00BG474P8,"Wow!  Jorge Ameer has done it again!  Made another movie that mistakes a non-sequitor for a film ending twist.  A director can leave connecting-the-dots to a discerning audience -- if you provide the dots.  To show a lovely aquarium for 90 minutes then drop a lead brick in it isn't a twist. A movie twist should do two things: be a surprise and in retrospect seem inevitable.

This film deserved more imagination, it's an off-the-wall beginning with cohesiveness and potential.  The anti-hero is a narcissistic and sadistic gentleman named Allan whom we assume will be somehow redeemed.  (Our fault if we presume too much, maybe he'll be taught a lesson or find true love and reform or simply get away with his cruelty as so many do in life, doesn't matter as long as something happens that makes sense.) The movie for quite a way seems to be going somewhere.

Allan has OCD, shown by his compulsive folding of clothes and obsessive rearranging of table-settings, which Ameer uses to convey a controlling nature -- an psychologically dubious notion at best.  We see him indifferent to the feelings of his frumpy partner of two years and his desire to escape her to collect a inheritance in Greece from his grandmother.  This passive-aggression is far more in keeping with his OCD and we begin suspect the movie is plumbing depths.  In Santorini he finds a ""clone"" -- a young man created from donor DNA to supply organs -- hiding in his closet, which ignites his desire to what -- empower the young man, give him the birthright of a human being?  No, he decides to make him a dog -- feeding him from a bowl and paper training him -- not a nice reaction but fodder for discussion and many cinematic possibilities.  Where it goes from there, anyone who wants to see the film for themselves can decide.  Ameer has made a number of movies, so I assume somebody is buying them.  even I sprung for a couple.

This one has better production values, so the disappointment was greater which was why I gave it so low a rating.  You can't get there (the ending) from here (the beginning) so the meaningless ending means ""I ran out of money"" or ""I ran out of time"" or ""I got bored and tacked this on.""  The acting is marginally better than previous films (except for Ameer who is wooden and his part unnecessary.)  The isle of Santorini is gorgeous -- note credit for the stock film company.  Maybe using someone else's script, skipping a movie and spending double on a completely considered one, and hiring a director would fulfill Ameer's ambitions.  Produce away.  (Oh, the actors are beautiful, D'Agostino, the clone, is naked most of the time; and the actress who plays the fiancee deserves better roles.)",1367712000,4,2698,4.659619450317125
5615886,3,B00BG474P8,"Young corporate executive Allan Dawson feels bored with his life in London, especially with his live-in fiance'.  When his grandmother leaves him property in beautiful Santori, Greece, he sees that as the perfect excuse to get away from both, stretching out the little time it actually takes to settle those legal matters.  As he settles into the beautiful beach-front home, he discovers he has a houseguest of sorts ... a dirty, non-communicative young man who turns out to be an experimental clone raised to provide spare organs for rich people, but who escaped when the ship carrying him crashed off the island.  His name, D'Agostino, is on a metal plate on his collar.

Allan initially treats D'Agostino as a unique pet, cleans him up and tries to teach him basic ""No"" and ""Stay"" commands, while feeding him from a dog bowl.  But the attractive young clone, totally dependent on him, makes him realize what is missing in his own life, and he begins to form an emotional ... and eventually a sexual ... attachment that threatens to complicate his life from that point forward.

Billed on some sites as a ""gay film,"" this really isn't, although it has content about repressed sexual desire, as well as a few points about gender identity.  What it also has is filmmaker Jorge Ameer, who is known for his ""over the top"" films that seem to thrive on making the viewer uncomfortable, much in the way as people slow down to watch a bad accident on the freeway.  The acting is adequate, though not great, and I had issues with both bad sound in some scenes and jerky photography that became a distraction.  The ending was more than unsettling, though expected of this filmmaker.  On the plus side is a pleasant musical score, and film of some of the most beautiful scenery you'll find anywhere.  Some nudity and simulated sex, likely a strong R rating would have applied.  While fans of the filmmaker would disagree, I can't give this more than three stars out of five.",1367366400,6,1965,4.713450292397661
5615887,5,B00BG474P8,"Writer/director Jorge Ameer continues to make fascinating little films that dare to go where few others even contemplate. Asked to review the Unedited Proof of a film is both exciting and frustrating: exciting because the viewer gets to see all the ideas in their various forms before being edited into a final product, frustrating because the film comes in bit and pieces that dilutes the impact of the story. But there is enough here to see that once finished this strange, somewhat macabre story should have appeal with audiences.

Allan Dawson (Keith Roenke) is in a seemingly flatline relationship with live-in girlfriend Sylvia (Torie Tyson, better known for her singing than her acting skills): something is missing (other than the apparent age mismatch between the young Roenke and the more mature Tyson), a fact that becomes apparent when Allan is notified that his grandmother has bequeathed him land on the Greek Island of Santorini. Allan departs to investigate the surprise, thinking he will immediately sell the property to better his financial status. But once he arrives in Santorini he is mesmerized by the beauty of the island and is introduced to the inherited home by an agent Niko (Jorge Ameer). As Allan settles in he hears strange sounds and discovers they come form a locked closet containing a human clone - filthy and whimpering. The naked male is named D'Agostino (Michael Angels): apparently heading on a transatlantic voyage at sea from an Italian lab to America, D'Agostino is a human clone left for dead at the shores of Santorini. This lost cargo, commissioned by wealthy individuals for organ tranplants, is abandoned as the freight cannot be recovered.

Allan cleans the clone, feeds him, keeps him on a leash like a pet animal, an slowly becomes attached to D'Agostino. When D'Agostino goes missing Allan is frantic and searches for his lost treasure along the shores of the island - the place where the lost D'Agostino sits in reverie. Through a series of dream sequences we watch as Sylvia becomes less important and D'Agostino becomes the extension of Allan he has always longed to discover. There is a surprise ending the will take the audience off guard and Jorge Ameer handles this neo-science fiction ending very well.

As is usually the case with Ameer's films, the visuals are of utmost importance. Here cinematographer Zach Voytas captures the flora and fauna and the generally breathtaking beauty of Santorini to great effect. The musical score, the reason for this release of a memento of the film, is a mixed bag, too often covering the dialogue of the film, but the ingredients are there and hold great promise. It is bizarre, challenging, and inline with Jorge Ameer's fresh take on cinema. Grady Harp, February 13",1361318400,13,2764,5.004347826086956
