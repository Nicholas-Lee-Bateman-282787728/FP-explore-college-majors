8381941,4,B002VD5S92,"Something different and original.  It reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode, but it was made several years before the debut of the Twilight Zone TV program.  For anyone who's ever visited Hong Kong the 1950's views of the city filmed in the movie should prove interesting. Frequent airline travelers may have similar thoughts about 1950's airline flights.",1468627200,,356,5.120689655172414

8381943,4,B002VD5S92,"Interesting film.

 My main motivation to buy it (for viewing on my iPhone) is because it was directed by Leslie Norman, who, a year after its release, directed a science fiction film I have a certain fondness for called X, THE UNKNOWN. Also, one critic I read gave THE NIGHT MY NUMBER CAME UP four out of four stars.

 You don't have to believe that dreams can be mystical prophecy in order to enjoy this movie. For me, it was fascinating to see how people on a routine military plane flight react whenever something occurs which makes them think that the dream a military officer had about the plane crashing might be coming true.

 But the primary thing of interest to me in the story is the implicit issue of predestination versus free will. If the dream comes true, that would seem to say that everything in human life is predetermined, and if that is true, than there is no such thing as free will; if there is free will, then--barring accidents--Man can control his destiny.  The characters in this film seem to be engaged in a battle between these two ideas--you can see it in their faces.

 The movie also has good special effects (for 1955, of course; actually, to me that means they're still good).

NOTE:  Most of the movie is a flashback, but the screenwriter and the director don't let you know clearly enough when the story flashes back.  I was a little confused at that point the first time I watched the film.  So just know that when the story seems to be going back to the day before, it is.",1409011200,,1509,4.443636363636363
8381944,4,B002VD5S92,"Stellar cast! Storyline maybe just a bit stretched (and perhaps a tad hokey) for the length of film, but no problem. Very entertaining, and wonderful performances by some of Britain's finest film thespians. Some real thriller-tension at times too!",1408752000,,247,5.358974358974359
8381945,4,B002VD5S92,A group of good and extremely well photographed British actors board a C-47 and have the beginning of a Twilight Zone experience en route. Do dreams come true? Another formative British fantasy film from the fearsom 50's that is required viewing. Support these English jewels and have fun at the same time.,1318464000,9,306,4.903846153846154
