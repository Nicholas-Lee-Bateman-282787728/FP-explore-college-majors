484161,5,6302561019,"this joe camp film (of the benji films) looks at the experimental use of camels by the cavalry in the american southwest after the civil war.  slapstick comedy that can be enjoyed by all members of the family, be they 2 or 92.  and yes, it's based on real events; the camels were turned loose, and hadji ali is buried (in arizona, if i'm not mistaken) under a tombstone adorned with a camel.  if clean humor is your cuppa tea, get this one before it disappears again!",1112054400,2,467,4.344827586206897

The army gives them camels as an experiment, which at first is hated by those in the unit. However, in the end the experiment is canceled, but the soldiers have grown too fond of their camels. Starring James Hampton, Slim Pickens, Denver Pyle, Jack Elam and Frank Inn. Great family movie, entertaining, and clean.",1104624000,2,463,4.658536585365853
484163,4,6302561019,"This is a fairly funny movie about a cavalry unit in the US Army that is issued Camels instead of horses to patrol the American Southwestern deserts. Supposedly based on actual events. Funny in a sort of ""F Troop"" fashion.",1102723200,3,222,4.575
484164,5,6302561019,"I recommend this slightly historical and very hilarious movie for schools when they want to reward students with a video.  Few children have ever seen this movie which tells the story of the calvary's attempt to use camels in the desert southwest.  Lots of slapstick humor with a simple plot.  The only violence are humorous fist fights and silly exaggerated stories.  The sweet romance culminates in a kiss.  Okay, so there is cigar smoking and there is a salon, but it is all a part of a good old western.",1062979200,12,507,4.588888888888889

484166,5,6302561019,"Joe Camp (once of Benji fame) has put together the BEST historical farce ever!  When this film was first released, I took EVERY member of my family to see it.  I ended up seeing it AT LEAST 5 times!!  I look forward to getting my kids & grandkids (should I have any) hooked on this film.
Set in the days when Jefferson Davis was U. S. Secretary of War (Yes, THAT Jefferson Davis!), HAWMPS tells the hilarious tale of what might have become known as the United States Camel Corps.  With great Western action scenes, a farcical barroom brawl, and the greatest historical puns and insider jokes on record for American pseudohistory, this film is not only a must-see, but a MUST-OWN for any fan of both history and comedy, not to mention historical comedy!
The ending is just TOO much- I won't spoil it for you, but in the movie theater, it totally BLEW ME AWAY!  What a Pun!!!!
Fans of Benji will want this video for the ""Benji's Life Story"" aspect -I hope they get hooked on HAWMPS too.  (It has a few cameo appearances by Benji, after all. . .)",997488000,2,1043,4.3782383419689115

The men of this fort were waiting for prized arabia horses, strong, fast, beautiful. But they got camels. The rest is History!  This movie has stayed through the years as one of my families favorites. It's great western fun for adults as well as kids.

484257,4,6302561019,We remembered watching this movie many years ago and we were excited to see it available on DVD. We have it on VHS. It is a fun movie very loosely based on a real experiment done by the U.S. Army around the Civil War. It is funny and heartwarming. It is an excellent family movie as it has no curse words or flesh scenes. The only thing that might be an issue is that alcoholic beverages are drunk by the adults. Other than that there is nothing but fun to be had from watching the video. The conversion from tape to video leaves something to be desired however. It has a fuzzy picture. However for the price we paid we are very happy to own it on DVD.,1454976000,,652,4.1015625

Valentine was brought on the stage for this (she is the ""star"" camel of the picture.)
  I purchased a copy on VHS when it was available. The final joke of the movie depends on your seeing the TV cigarette ads that existed prior to their removal in early 1970's A fun picture of its time (1976) I don't know how good the transfer to DVD is, or even if the final joke was cut from the transfer",1443398400,,613,4.0578512396694215

Found it about fifteen years later on a VHS copy and introduced it to my husband and sons who enjoyed it just as much as I had.
  We were tickled when I found it here on Amazon and planned our family movie night. The story remains delightfully just as enjoyable, however the quality of this DVD was very disappointing. It has the appearance of being transferred from a previous copy: there are strange shadows that appear randomly at the top or bottom of the screen, the picture is often blurry, and the night scenes are too dark to see what is going on. If our first impression of this movie came solely from this DVD, I do not think it would have ever made out ""favorites"" list.

484413,5,6302561019,I loved it when I Was 13 and I love it still NOW at 54.  Slapstick style Western comedy fits two genres of movie----Western and Comedy.

484414,4,6302561019,"Based on the true story of the Great Camel Experiment launched by the U.S. military just prior to the Civil War, Hawmps is a fun look at Army soldiers confronted by the ""ships of the desert."" During this brief experiment camels turned out to be ideal for the environment found in the Great South-West Desert, the area which would someday include parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. What went wrong? Well, first of all the Secretary War who requested the experiment was Jefferson Davis and he would eventually go on to a bigger gig... President of the Confederacy. And Congress, which financed the project, was being torn apart by sectarian and political divisions.

If not for that, camels might have become as familiar to outlaws like Jesse James and Billy the Kid as colt six-shooters.

A light-hearted comedy, Hawmps is a good film. The scriptwriters took some liberties with the original story (the character of Hi-Jolly would have spoken with a Greek accent, NOT an upper-class British one), but I know I enjoyed the rewrite!",1388016000,2,1048,4.882022471910112

About the only real points were location, camels, and the Arab tender whose name was corrupted to Hi Jolly.  All reports were that the camels were much more efficient as supply haulers than horses or donkeys, but the divisiveness caused by the oncoming Civil War doomed the project.",1383868800,,461,4.822784810126582

484477,3,6302561019,"This film wasn't as funny on the small screen as I remembered it in the theater back in the 70s. Perhaps if it had been in letterbox format, it might have helped.  The DVD picture quality wasn't great, either.

The story itself was pretty good; it's the heavily fictionalized story of the US Army's experiment with camels in the 1850s.  I read in several places that the movie was set after the Civil War, but that is incorrect. While I can't vouch for the accuracy of the uniforms for the period, there are plenty of period references that do indicate it was set in the 1850s, particularly references to Jefferson Davis as Secretary of War.

The humor is often slapstick and sometimes some of the punchlines fall flat or are dated. There's a cameo appearance by Benjie that today's audiences won't appreciate. The last line of the film has one of the characters complain that he has to ""walk a mile for these camels.""  If you don't recall the Camel cigarette ads from the 70s and before, it makes for a pretty lame ending!

I was thinking of using the film in a history class to go with a reading about the real camel experiment. It may work, it may not.

Overall, it's a pretty good family film with no cursing, no sex, and no sexual innuendo. There is some humor related to alcohol use; one soldier is always drunk (he sobers up and gets straight by the end of the film) and one of the camels will drink any open bottle she can get her lips on.

Hawmps? was made by the same folks who made the Benjie films.",1254614400,2,1510,4.367857142857143

Shame, because it was a good story for the kids and adults alike.  The video is awful, I mean hardly in focus, no subtitles, just a waste of your money.  The VHS tape I have was actually better quality video.",1502582400,,331,4.466666666666667

This is a highly compressed video which looks like the source was a VHS tape recorded at low speed.  Tint and brightness were not as expected.  It's still better than not having the DVD, but I would like to have known this up front.  The case and packaging were good.",1495497600,2,399,4.337837837837838

7827841,5,6302561019,This is a light comedy.  Sometimes it is fun to just watch something like this and it is especially interesting to know that it is based on a real event in the US military.  Who knew we had a camel corps!,1493856000,,204,3.951219512195122
