8387475,5,B0032G2TYY,"This...of course...is great. My favorites. I wasn't there in the beginning. Buy I grew up with the reruns. The only draw back...in my opinion... Is. If it was filmed, taped...whatever...in glorious black and white....it should stay that way. When the old shows/movies are colorized...they look like a bad painting. Lea e thins as they are. Restore them...yes. But only to bring out the original conception. I only hope they never colorize Kansas in ""Oz"". It will ruin the whole imagining of things.",1408924800,,498,5.085365853658536
8387476,5,B0032G2TYY,"This is one of the most affordable DVD buys I have found in a long time.  This set contains 4 Gems in One:  I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched, Gidget & The Partridge Family.  Four wonderful comedies all together in one set.  I had not seen some of these episodes in years & Gidget was especially fun to see. Sally Field & Don Porter shine in Gidget.  I highly recommend this set:  picture quality, sound, etc. all great!  Don't miss out on this one!",1365897600,5,445,4.289156626506024
