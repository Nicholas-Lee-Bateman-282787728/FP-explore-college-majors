1982803,3,B00019G4AU,"I'm only giving this collection 3 stars in honor of the late Ed Sullivan. It was a staple of Sunday evening televison in our house when I was a kid in the 1960s. I remember watching it in black and white and then the change around 1966 to color! The greatest talent in the WORLD wanted to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show and for a video company to release nothing but brief segments is truly an insult to Mr. Sullivan, to the guests and to the fans that have longed for COMPLETE shows for a long time. This collection is just a rehashed compilation of what has been out there on VHS and DVD for many years. Until a video company decides to release a collection of complete shows, I won't buy another choppy collection. Suggestion: how about a Best of Ed Sullivan by year? Give us 10 COMPLETE Ed Sullivan shows from 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1970! Keep it simple and original, we don't need fancy celebrities of today giving us introductions to the show. Surely there are more than enough shows to give us 100 complete shows from 10 years.",1283040000,,1068,4.371859296482412

Even though most of the performances are only clips, they usually start in the middle and go to the end of the set, it didn't mess up the experience of watching the very talented guests that appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show.""

There's a mixed bag of performances and SOFA Home Entertainment, the producers of the DVD set, did a good job of cleaning up the footage. Each DVD is entertaining and although I wasn't born yet, I can see why millions watched Sullivan's show. There really is something for everyone!

=====  UNFORGETTABLE PERFORMANCES DVD =====
Carol Burnett (who also appeared on ""the Ed Sullivan Show"") hosts this special and features some top stars. Most of the performances are just clips but some are complete. It shows episodes from when the Sullivan show began in the 50s and also includes interviews with some of the more infamous/famous guests that graced the show. Highlights include:

* Elvis Presley's first and third performance on TV.

* Barbra Streisand's first appearance in 1963 performing ""When The Sun Comes Out."" Only the last half of the performance is presented.

* Sammy Davis, Jr. & Ella Fitzgerald. Full performance of Davis and Fitzgerald ""S'Wonderful"" duet. Very cool as the two start scatting and improvising throughout the song.

* Rolling Stones. Half performance of ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction.""

* Fidel Castro. Sullivan goes to Cuba and interviews Castro.

* The Beatles. Complete performance of ""Ticket To Ride"" and they meet and greet Ed.

* Janis Joplin. Half performance of ""Raise Your Hand.""

* The Young Rascals. Beginning and edited performance of ""Good Lovin'.""

* The Doors. Controversy with the censors and how they wanted ""The Doors"" and ""The Rolling Stones"" to change certain lyrics. Stones changed, but Doors did not. Ray Manzarek of the Doors talks about it.

* Jackson 5. Complete performance of ""I Want You Back.""

===== THE GREATEST ENTERTAINERS DVD =====
Hosted by Burt Reynolds this special picks up where the first one left off. More rock acts and stand-up comedians in this set. Some of the guests that appeared on the show discuss what it was like. Again, performances aren't complete. Highlights include:

* Frankie Lymon
* 5th Dimension
* Petula Clark
* Tom Jones
* Johnny Mathis
* Cool Novelty Acts and Acrobats
* The Beatles

SPECIAL FEATURE: ""SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS""--05:39-minutes
Ed goes around the world looking for stories. In Cuba, to talk to Castro. Spoleto, Italy, to talk to Giancarlo Manatti. Tokyo, Japan, shows a kids' baseball team. And finally Ed goes to Ireland to kiss the Blarney Stone.

===== BEST OF THE BROADWAY MUSICALS DVD =====
Narrated by John Raitt (Oklahoma!), all of the performances--with the exception of Ethel Merman's ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" which is not complete--are the full performances done by the original actors from their respective Broadway shows.

Sullivan also talks to Broadway composers Rodgers & Hammerstein and Lerner & Lowe.

I didn't care for the Celeste Holm performance of ""I Can't Say No"" from Oklahoma!

SPECIAL FEATURE: BROADWAY MUSICAL TRIVIA
Text, written on a 3x5 card graphic, that shows plot synopsis, cast, songs, producers, run dates and how many performances including revivals, and if the musical was adapted into a motion picture.

===== ED'S AMAZING ANIMAL ACTS DVD =====
No special features and no narration or host. The clips are in color and black & white, and even though some are really old and blurry, it doesn't interfere with viewing pleasure. Highlights include:

* Clyde Beatty, lion tamer, loses control and Ed must go to the audience while you can hear the lions growling in the background. This has a voice over and was taken from the ""Greatest Entertainers"" DVD.

* Elephants doing handstands on balance beams.

* Gymnastic Chimps who also smoke and ride motorcycles.

* Dogs who walk down ladders on their front paws.

* Monkeys riding on the back of Grey Hounds.

* Tightrope-walking Sea Lions.

* Bears that dance and ride motorcycles.

* Birds that can add and subtract.

Fun set and though I only listed some of the highlights above, there are many more to be found on this four DVD set.",1260057600,18,5232,5.828083989501312

8008837,1,B00019G4AU,"They really do mean 'best of', and not 'complete'.  Most of the songs recorded with Mr. Ed get cut off half way through so that some narrator can talk about how good it was- instead of just letting the song play through to infer the quality first hand.  I would not recommend you waste your money on half-performances, unless you like hearing narrators talk about how good the rest of the show was rather than letting you see for yourself.",1404864000,,439,4.475

The box is dented and torn.  I paid $ 99.00 for this in hopes of giving it to my mother in law as a Christmas gift.  I'll not be able to do so, as it would be embarassing to present this to someone.",1323129600,2,359,3.7972972972972974
8008840,2,B00019G4AU,I purchased this box set thinking it was going to contain all the late sixties music. It contained a lot of stuff which I didn't care about and only contained about 15% of what I liked. If you want to get a good Sullivan video look for the Ed Sullivan's Rock n Roll Classics series.,1289260800,,282,4.1454545454545455
8008841,5,B00019G4AU,"There are some amazing ""firsts"" in this collection, including a very young Michael Jackson and the Jackson Five. There is also sthe only taped performance (according to the DVD information) of Richard Burton and Julie Andrews singing ""Camelot."" Sammy Davis, Jr. is spectacular with Ella Fitzgerald. Clips are mixed with interviews from some of Sullivan's regulars, including Joan Rivers and Ella Fitzgerald. Some of the interviews reveal insider info and that was intriguing to hear. George Carlin's ""hippy dippy"" weatherman is also fun to watch. Janis Joplin also gets her place in the spotlight of Sullivan clips.

The downside? Many of the famous names who appeared on Sullivan's show had only brief clips in the DVD collection, not complete performances. It was like seeing a ""teaser"" of some wonderful moments with a huge letdown as the segments were cut off. Even so, some historic information about Sullivan's personality as well as the show itself is revealed, perfect for trivia buffs.

Some of the shows do seem a bit dated, though. I found it particularly difficult to watch some of the animal acts, although the Lipizzaner Stallions were both impressive and gorgeous to watch. It was clear that there were animals who weren't treated properly and a very frightening moment with Clyde Beatty, losing control of his lions, forcing Sullivan to go into the audience while the cameras pan away from the stage. Luckily, Beatty gets control of his beasts but is angry with Sullivan because he'd argued that the ring was too small and he didn't feel comfortable being so close to the lions.

Because of the censors' standards of the time, both The Rolling Stones and Jim Morrison were requested to change some of their famous lyrics to suit family audiences. The Rolling Stones agreed but Jim Morrison did not. Both performances aired with Mick Jagger looking clearly angry. Morrison was told he'd never perform on the show again but The Rolling Stones came back.

My first introduction (as well as much of the country's intro) to The Beatles came from Sullivan's show. Reportedly, he hadn't even HEARD them before they appeared! He just knew they'd gotten a huge turnout when they appeared at the airport and that was enough for Sullivan. Of course, the audience went berserk, with screams filling the room, while American viewers were also riveted by the group.

Sullivan was a huge fan of Broadway so expect to see plenty of great moments from famous shows, all included on one of the DVDs in this four DVD set. As noted, Richard Burton and Julie Andrews are incredible. Gwen Vernon shows off her dance moves from ""Sweet Charity"" and Anthony Newley reveals a fine singing voice (although I felt his makeup was a bit distracting)

For those not familiar with the Sullivan show, Topo Gigio, a little mouse character, was a regular, charming adults and children alike. I remember seeing him and being enthralled. There is also a feature with one of the best ventriloquists I've ever seen. Sure to bring back memories, this set has its pros but left me disheartened from the moments I'd have liked to see in their entirety.",1287273600,2,3126,4.922201138519924
