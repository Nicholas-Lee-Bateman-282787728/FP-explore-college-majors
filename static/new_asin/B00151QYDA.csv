8257091,5,B00151QYDA,A funeral reunites a group of friends that grew up together.  I really enjoyed this movie because it describes how life really goes for most of us.  We never like hearing the truth until it's too late and we never like growing up either until it's too late.  I recommend this movie to people who like a good Drama.  If you're looking to buy this just because it has a good cast of actors then you might want to think again.,1399507200,,423,4.185185185185185
8257092,3,B00151QYDA,I think its pretty boring movie. Because to me it doesn't really deal with drugs all that much. And Kaley Cuoco's part is probably the only place where you see some drug. If you're like me I wanted to see how drugs affect people and what the outcome would be. But it doesn't have all that. Its not sexy neither.,1278720000,,311,4.2
8257093,5,B00151QYDA,"I originally first randomly fell upon this movie while watching HBO. I started watching it maybe 30 or so minutes after it had started, but really enjoyed it. I rarely purchase DVD's, but I enjoyed this film so much I wanted to have it on DVD. I got to watch the film in it's entirety and really love this film. The film is still pretty fresh in my mind since I watched it a few days ago, so I'll try to give it an accurate review.

The films 'feel' is like Dazed & Confused. It feels sort of like a coming of age movie, although it's hard to say if any of the characters have developed in some way by the end.

The film takes place over three days (Friday, Saturday, Sunday).

I felt like I was really able to relate to the characters in the film. Mitch and Dixon seem to be really struggling with the actual death of their friend Bender, where as Stan is dealing with things going on in his life.

I felt as if the movie made sense, maybe it leaves you with something to be desired, but it certainly stirs up familiar feelings within the viewer. There isn't really anything special or unique about the characters, not that that is a bad thing. It's a bit of a sad movie, and I believe this is the direction the director wanted to take it.

It's not really about anything, it's just a glimpse into these characters normal, and perhaps even stagnant lives.

It's hard to describe what this movie is trying to achieve, in that it's quite possibly trying to achieve nothing, and perhaps portraying how life is actually like. I think it's a great story though, it's very simple, but superb.

Eddie Kaye Thomas' character Stan seems to be a big focus of the movie, and the emphasis on his relationships (or lack there-of) with girls is one many can relate to, albeit sad.

Anyone who would consider themselves to even slightly be a person of 'depth' will understand and enjoy this movie, I strongly suggest getting it.",1252454400,4,1914,4.387005649717514
