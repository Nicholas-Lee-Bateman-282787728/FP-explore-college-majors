Her friend Penny works with her and they both notice how gorgeous he is when Jo tells Penny that John offered her $100 to have sex with him. Penny urges Jo to go ahead and do it just for the thrill and she does so. Arriving at a hotel with John Jo starts to panic, but he insists and they sleep together, but the way he sneaks around bothers her and worse when she discovers a rifle under the bed she again panics and leaves. When an Archbishop is assassinated outside of the hotel Jo freaks and calls the police telling them about John, but Penny tells her to put the phone down before revealing who she is because she had committed a crime when she slept with John so both friends decide to leave New York. John finds out that Jo had contacted the police, but after trying to search for her he realizes that she has vanished leaving a loose end, which he regrets. 3 years later Jo resides in Oregon now married to a police officer named Frank, whilst Penny works as a hairdresser. In the building where Jo works she stands in the crowded elevator and she discovers that in front of her stands John. This was a terrific movie Gregory Harrison was brilliant portraying an assassin yet looking so normal that no one can guess what he does for a living. Scott Valentine was in this movie as a cop and a friend of Jo's husband Frank and he was great too. A movie worth watching.",998784000,5,1443,4.250909090909091
