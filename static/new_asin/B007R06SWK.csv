8521126,5,B007R06SWK,"I REALLY hope the distributors/filmmakers read these reviews because I have to say- you can't know how happy it makes me to see less known/lower budget horror films like this being released for the world to see and enjoy! I was shown this film for the first time and really loved it. I've been waiting for a DVD and here it is; and it's a damn good one!

The product succeeds on every level; Region 0 (All regions, PC compatable), protective slip cover, green holographic title on cover, great quality audio video etc, creative interactive menu, English subtitle option (subs are really great), and surprisingly great extras!! Cast/Director interviews and commentary making of and more. If you love Asian horror cinema (ghosts specifically), you should get this. A film that rivals Shutter as far as Thai horror deserves this release!

If you see this film available<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coming-Soon-DVD-2008-Thailand-Official-Slipcover-Edition/dp/B002FRC7ZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coming Soon DVD (2008, Thailand)(Official Slipcover Edition)</a>, I highly recommend watching.

The movie is cleverly told from three perspectives. The primary story is focused upon a couple who works at a movie theater that is preparing for the much hyped attraction. Things quickly being to spiral out of control as a few of the staff make bootleg copies of the film.

The second aspect deals with the actual attraction itself. The movie, which I swear is a retelling of a previously made film whose name escapes me (I think it might be along the line of the ""Seamstress""). I will not go into detail because it would completely ruin the third perspective.

Lastly, not only do you have the theater staff and the movie to contend with, but there is the production time of the movie in question.

These three perspectives are interwoven that they slip seamlessly from one aspect to another without ever jarring you away from the story telling. Of course, if you're a fan of Asian horror, you know the routine it will follow. Yet, the execution has had new life breathed into it. By the end, if you paid enough attention to the narrative, you'll have some choice words for the fictional theater and the fictional movie production team.

Speaking of narrative. Watching foreign movies can be frustrating at times due to terrible Closed Captioning. That is not the case with Coming Soon.

I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for something above average. If you are a fan of Asian horror, it still follows the pretty standard structure. What it does do, and do quite well, is breathe new life into the tried and true method. For those not familiar with Asian horror outside of American remakes, I suggest watching this with the original foreign film Shutter.",1299024000,2,1978,5.2834394904458595
8521128,5,B007R06SWK,"This isn't a horror classic, but its a really really solid genre film basically about the workers at a movie theater being haunted by the spirit being displayed on the cinema screens. Seems cheesy and a little lame, but it works very well and I won't go into more detail or I'll give too much away. This DVD is excellent. Great packaging with a nice slipcase. I don't collect DVDs anymore really, but it looks real nice with my other fancy packed DVDs on my shelf. Everything else without premium packing I've relegated to case logic binders and have tossed the cases.",1296777600,,568,4.578431372549019
