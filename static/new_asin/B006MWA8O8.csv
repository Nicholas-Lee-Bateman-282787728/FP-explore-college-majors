5006295,2,B006MWA8O8,"I appreciate the effort that went into making this film. The acting was not as good as other Christian films. It just didn't measure up to my expectations. The story line was not very strong either, though it did have some good moments.",1333929600,5,236,4.511627906976744
5006296,1,B006MWA8O8,"I really can't think of a way this movie could have been worse.

I have to be honest, though, and admit that I only watched half of it. For all I know, it suddenly got awesome the moment after I lost patience and turned it off, but I'm doubtful.

As the the title and the synopsis you've already read indicate, the storyline is essentially the apostle relating his memories of Jesus to a Roman jailor before his execution, except this goofy movie gets a bunch of it wrong... For instance, it has Jesus asking them ""Who do people say that I am?"", like, two minutes after Peter meets him instead of a short time before Jesus' final week, which, of course, radically alters the significance and meaning of the event-- the significance and meaning agreed upon by all three synoptic gospels. Also, for some goofy reason, it depicts Jesus washing their feet AFTER they eat the Last Supper, which just doesn't make any sense. (And their ""Jesus"" looks like he's pushing 50 or 60... not sure how they thought they could pull that off, when Jesus was in his early-to-mid thirties when he died.)

And it's not just their butchery of the factuality of the story that I found off-putting. It seems like all the wrong parts are dramatized... like when Jesus washed their feet, they built it up like the audience was supposed to just gush with sentimental awe when Peter stuck his foot in the tub. It was just lame, lame, lame. It was just lazy and poorly written and poorly executed. I say ""lazy"" because it appears that the movie-makers were just counting on people already being emotionally keyed-in before they started watching, so they didn't bother with all the usual stuff storytellers do to get an audience invested in a story, like character-development, scene-setting/world-building, etc. Because it's aimed at a Christian audience and we're supposed to already love the story of the foot-washing, for instance, we're supposed to be just thrilled when a bunch of actors put on costumes and spout churchy lines while another actor scrubs their feet... In fact, this entire movie (Ok, the half I could stomach) is just a long string of half-considered, superficial church cliches with no depth or gravity or purpose, so it comes across as a crude, even annoying gospel tract set to film. You're better off just reading the Bible for yourself and letting it play out in your own ""theater of the mind"" than watching this silly attempt.",1333497600,29,2426,4.75771971496437
5006297,2,B006MWA8O8,"Weak at points, poor portrayals of characters, inaccurate and can be annoyng if you have read the Bible. Why is it so difficult for contemporary directors to follow the story line?",1333411200,16,180,4.838709677419355
5006298,5,B006MWA8O8,"The setting of this movie is while Peter is imprisoned as an older man, during the time after Christ's death & resurrection when Christians were being persecuted (67 A.D.), awaiting his imminent death.  One of the jailers, curious about this ""famous"" Christian, risks his neck to ask Peter questions about his experiences with Jesus -- particularly the events surrounding His crucifixion.  Peter recounts portions of his time with Jesus, and the viewer gets to see Scripture in motion -- it is very powerful to see and hear Jesus words in context! It is impactful, also, to realize how human Jesus' disciples were... yet still so loved by Jesus.

Would not recommend for young children, as the depiction of Satan could be a bit frightening.",1333238400,46,740,4.951612903225806

5006301,4,B006MWA8O8,"A few weeks ago, a friend sent me a link on FaceBook for the trailer of Apostle Peter and the Last Supper (PureFlix). I just finished watching the movie.

The Synopsis (from the Official Movie Site):
Set in Rome A.D. 67. Two jailers at the ancient Marmertine Prison take custody of a famous criminal. He is Simon Peter of Galilee-apostle, disciple, and personal friend of Jesus, also called The Christ. Condemned to death, the elderly Peter (Robert Loggia) recounts his life as a simple fisherman who became one of the boldest figures in all of Christianity. As Peter prepares to depart this earthly life, he will make an unforgettable impression on his jailers through the saving power of the Gospel.

Friends, let me tell you right now--this is a beautiful movie which presents the gospel in an open and moving presentation.
Throughout the film we follow a Roman soldier named Martinian (portrayed very effectively by Laurence Fuller). He and his friend, Processus, are charged with guarding Peter in the days leading up to his execution.

Martinian's wife has expressed interest in learning more about Jesus (although it's dangerous to do so) and he takes advantage of having Peter under his charge by asking a series of questions. As Peter recounts his life with Jesus, Martinian comes to understand the meaning of sin, the sacrifice Jesus made for us all, and what it means to trust Him.
The story is very strong. I liked the characters of Martinian and his wife. I found it interesting to consider particular elements (like waiting for Jesus in the garden as he prayed) through Peter's eyes (portrayed by Ryan Alosio), his desire to serve yet failing in crucial moments.

The movie is well acted.  The pacing does lag in a couple of places but not enough to hamper overall enjoyment. I must give props for the locations--stunning! I could quibble about a few minor prop pieces. More attention to little details could have created a more authentic feel to the movie (particularly during the Last Supper scene), but overall it has little impact on what's important--the gospel.

All of the scenes with Jesus are taken straight from scripture with little embellishment. Bruce Marchiano (who played Jesus in The Visual Bible's Gospel of Matthew) once again brings Jesus to the screen with a strength, warmth and humanity that can be missing in other presentations.

Apostle Peter and the Last Supper is a great addition to anyone's movie collection. It's a wonderful way to introduce people to the message of the gospel. I recommend it.",1330819200,127,2538,4.91588785046729

Peter is portrayed by Robert Loggia who is a very well known and great actor. (you can read about him here http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005162/).
It shows Peter in jail telling his story of Jesus to a young Roman guard; and a very detailed telling of the Last Supper. It is a well thought out story that delivers a very powerful message about faith.
I've watched this over and over and I'm moved every time. This movie has the power to convert someone who is unsure of their salvation.
I can't recommend this movie enough!
I've read some reviews saying that they didn't like it due to the acting, but I honestly think the actors are very convincing for the most part...especially Robert Loggia's portrayal of Peter.
I'd also recommend The Book of Daniel. It's made by the same company, Pure Flix Ent.

5006485,2,B006MWA8O8,"I did not find this movie either exciting, moving, or compelling. This was chiefly because the actor playing the part of Peter emoted his memories of Jesus in an almost monotonic tone throughout. Since the subject itself was so awesome and electrifying, I expected Peter to show a more feelingful or emotional level of recollection of his Master than the ho-hum manner in which he spoke his lines.

I was not convinced of the conversion that occurs near the end--it happens so abruptly and quickly that I couldn't help feeling that it was forced to give the story a positive ending, without providing a gradual build-up to the point of conversion that would make it inescapably logical.

I felt that the actor who played the part of Jesus did not have the spiritual understanding needed to make me believe that he truly believed in what he was saying. To me he sounded like a very worldly person trying to act very spiritual. In other words, his performance was unconvincing to me. For example,I think the actor in the TV miniseries JESUS OF NAZARRETH  did a far superior job and did convince me.",1428796800,2,1096,4.697916666666667

5006540,5,B006MWA8O8,"An amazing movie! I love the direction of this movie, Simon Peter is in prison awaiting to be put to his death for being a Christian. Peter is left alone praying and thinking about his life during the time he spent with Jesus. He is at peace with the idea of dying and going to heaven. Peter is visited by a roman guard that is curious about his walk with Jesus but defies the idea of being converted into a Christian. After Peter tells his amazing story the guard is even more curious about Jesus plight here on earth. After 3 days of Peter explaining to the guard as much as he can about his Lord, something amazing happens.

The movie is based on Peter's account of his days walking the earth with Jesus and the last supper. It is not in any way violent, it is perfect for the entire family. The crucifixion is not the main subject and is not displayed but mentioned during Peter's story of his life with Jesus.

Very good acting! The concept of the movie was refreshing!",1410912000,,974,4.316939890710382

You see his heart for others right up to the point of execution. And you feel the confusion in the guards mind. You can hear him asking himself ""How or why would God care for and love me?

Read Acts 2:38 and you will see that repentance and baptism was the way to the father from the beginning of the New Testament.  They try to introduce the false doctrine of praying Jesus into your heart during the Apostle's lifetime.  This practice did not start until the 1800's and these people will go to such lengths to distort the truth, as they do in all of Marchiano's films.

My only critique is the production ""set"" of the Roman Prison Cell.  It's is clearly a set and is far too pretty for what it would really have been.  But on a bigger screen it doesn't distract from the message.  The final words of Peter, for me, really make this movie worth it.",1381104000,4,434,4.430379746835443

I understand that it is supposed to be viewed through the eyes of Peter but this film exalts him higher than Scripture does. This is only to get people who do not know their Bible to believe Peter became the first pope. A teaching that is far from truth!  These modern movies are gathering people to believe a lie and to build support for ""the man of sin"" (Antichrist). 2 Thessalonians 2:1-11.",1380240000,3,531,4.418367346938775

5006653,4,B006MWA8O8,The Apostle Peter & The Last Supper is a really good movie.  Peter is imprisoned and tells one of his jailers the story of his life after meeting JESUS.  This movie covers Peter's life with his MESSIAH as well as the spiritual struggle of his jailers.  I especially like when CHRIST at the Last Supper says one of the Apostles would betray HIM this movie gives the best and probably most realistic depiction of that I have ever seen.  I also like the depiction of the taunting of Peter by the demon in prison which depicts the mental attacks satan uses very realistically.  I would recommend this movie for all ages and it would be great shown in churches.,1368489600,,656,4.4789915966386555

5006672,3,B006MWA8O8,"Was Peter really that old and unkempt looking? Scratchy voiced to boot. I was a little disappointed with his portrayer.
Content was good but dragged several places.",1360972800,3,164,5.111111111111111
5006673,5,B006MWA8O8,Great DVD I would recomend this movie. It tells the story of Peter while he is in prison and brings a Roman soldier to Christ. Peter shares his experience with a Roman soldier when he walked with Christ before he was Crucified.,1360972800,,227,4.428571428571429
5006674,5,B006MWA8O8,This movie is a great reminder of the Apostle Peter's experience while he was awaiting execution.  He still asks God to use him even in his last days.  The message is one to live by. The Blue Ray picture was outstanding.,1360713600,,220,4.341463414634147
5006675,5,B006MWA8O8,"outstanding production!  buy it, you will enjoy it. one of the best spiritual movie I ever watch and well acted",1359936000,,111,4.55
5006676,3,B006MWA8O8,This is not something I would watch over and over to learn more about Peter. It is unlike the movie PAUL which gives you at lot to think about and helps you understand more about who Paul was and how he might have lives.,1359504000,,220,4.0227272727272725
5006677,2,B006MWA8O8,"Frankly, my expectation going in was not very high. As a Christian, I have been repeatedly disappointed by films which muddle the Gospel message and story. This film was no exception. I was left with the impression that the script-writer sliced the Gospels up with scissors, threw the pieces in the air, then put them into the script wherever they fell. Jesus meeting Simon, giving him the name 'Peter', then asking who men say He is - and Peter, who has known Him only moments, declares Him to be the Christ! The Lord Jesus giving the disciples the Great Commission in the Garden of Gethsemane before the crucifixion! In an understandable desire not to put words in Christ's mouth which He did not actually say, the writer takes words and phrases Christ said and sticks them wherever he wants, with no relation to the true context or even, on several occasions, the meaning!

A previous reviewer said he thought this was a good Catholic movie, and he touched the other weak point of the film:
Did Simon Peter really cross himself after praying,as this actor seems to do? Would he have allowed people to bow before him, as the Peter of this film does? Are we really expected to believe the Peter of Scripture 'blessed' people, using - was that Holy Water??

And then the end, where a Campus-Crusade-style, repeat-after-me prayer equates 'conversion' with 'decision' and the repeating of a formulaic ritual-like prayer.

An ambitious project that could have been - should have been - much, much better.",1359244800,50,1501,4.810077519379845
5006678,5,B006MWA8O8,You can't go wrong with a subject like this!  God so loved the world that He gave His only Son!  Will view this in the near future!  Thank you for having this movie!,1358035200,,165,3.9393939393939394
5006679,3,B006MWA8O8,THE MOVIE IS ENTERTAINING AT TIMES AND STAYED CLOSE TO THE BIBLE'S ACCOUNT.  ONLY PART I DID NOT LIKE WAS THE 'DEVIL' OR 'DEMON' THAT KEEPS APPEARING TO TEMPT PETER --- DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT.,1357948800,3,200,4.405405405405405
5006690,5,B006MWA8O8,"I loved this movie.  As my heading says, I can watch this movie over and over again and probably not get bored with it.  I am a Christian and I don't watch Hollywood movies or much television.  I would recommend this movie to Christians or those who want a little bit of history on Jesus and the apostles.",1357516800,,305,4.224137931034483
5006691,4,B006MWA8O8,This is a great video and I liked it a lot!  It is a very good depiction of the last supper of our Lord Jesus Christ!!,1356912000,,118,3.5384615384615383
5006692,5,B006MWA8O8,Any student of the rise of Christianity will love this movie. It clearly shows the sacrifices the pointeers of early Christianity made and faithfully reflects what is recorded in the Holy Bible.,1354060800,,194,5.09375
5006693,5,B006MWA8O8,"I watch many movies online at Netflix. But only a few are worth my while to write a review so I can recommend it to many others. And Apostle Peter & The Last Supper
is one of those few.

** Spoiler Alert **

This movie focuses on the last days of the Apostle Peter in while prison. It uses conversations with his jailer and his flashbacks to tell the stories of Jesus with emphasis on the Last Supper.

This is an excellent way to see the many parts of the Bible presented using period costumes and suitable sets.

This is a great way to share Bible stories with children or others for the first time. Plus the lives like interactions bring a fresh perspective for those familiar with the Scriptures.

Many Bible verses are used in conversations in ways that are natural.

There is emphasis on the hope of heaven after death. The gospel message and conversions are a natural part of the story.

I would recommend this movie for:
Youth groups
Small groups
Sunday school classes
Married couple date night
Family nights
Community outreach event
College ministries
Home school learners
Baby sitters
Seekers
All who love Jesus and the Bible",1353974400,,1135,4.616915422885572

5006695,5,B006MWA8O8,"Although I am not an Fan Of Bruce Marchiano Nor the fact an person behind An Zombie movie had something to do with it,I think it's an Good Catholic Movie even though I am sure it is meant for Most Christian Audiences,one of the principals(Screenwriter) behind it is an Devout Catholic.(Despite the comment with some doubts.) It is not one of the best films,but It portrays St. Peter(Who Jesus bestowed his Keys of The Kingdom here on Earth.(Catholic Church)For his New Convent,THE CHURCH or The Catholic Church) In a great way as it was and The Story of Jesus and the Last Supper and it makes an good attempt,also tells the story of St. Justinian And St. Processus and their conversion on hearing Saint Peter's Words and what Christ went through for us. An Surprisingly Refreshing film.",1349481600,3,786,4.744525547445256

5006698,1,B006MWA8O8,I bought this video with the idea of sharing this movie with other's in our church. The couple I wanted to see this movie could not get it to run.  I had rented this movie and loved it enough to buy it. I did not check it out before giving it out. The movie was great for me. Since discovering Bruce Marchiano and the many things he has written and filmed has touched me and causes me to think more about the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.,1346889600,4,451,4.011111111111111
5006699,4,B006MWA8O8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this rendition of the purpose of Christ on earth.  The ""telling"" through the envisioned eyes of Peter was an excellent approach.",1344729600,,149,5.208333333333333
5006710,5,B006MWA8O8,"This film left me reeling in a good way.

I didn't expect much.  I received it as a preview copy to watch before it released.
At first I saw the simple 3 man skit portraying in a jail that looked made out of paper mache, and a cityscape that was not the best CG...

But then the story begins to unfold; the scripting and acting made you forget these above points.

Yet what captured me was the scripting of the Last Supper.  In it is a scene that captured the beauty, the questions, and the depth of what Jesus was saying to his disciples.
This scene has left me pondering... It brought a humanity to the Apostles; it brought to light the doubt that each and every one was dealing with.

This scene still lives in me at this moment.
Bruce Marchiano again plays Jesus in his real, and personal way that captures you as well.

This is a 5 star movie!
this is good for all over the age of 12.  There is a couple scenes with a tempter that could be a bit scary for younger kids so please review it before showing this to them.",1344729600,2,1022,4.126262626262626

5006715,5,B006MWA8O8,"Most movies are about The Christ or Paul or Joseph or Moses.  This movie is not only about Jesus, The Christ, but it recounts the personalities of the apostles themselves.  It makes the watcher understand that they have the same strengths and weaknesses as the apostles.  Doubting Thomas.  Peter and his temper.  Matthew.  James and John, the sons of Zebedee.  It is equally about each apostle as much as about the Christ.
The rendition of the Last Supper and what each apostle must have thought when Christ announced that one of them would betray them is extremely moving.
It made all of these people very real and human to me.",1336176000,31,628,4.654545454545454

5006717,5,B006MWA8O8,This is a must see movie.  There are not many videos about Apostle Paul but this is wonderful.
