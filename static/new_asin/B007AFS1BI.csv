5071677,5,B007AFS1BI,Excellent video for anyone interested in planes and space.  Great for kids and what a great alternative to the other stuff on TV.  My son loves the smithsonian dvds.,1364601600,,165,4.655172413793103
8513277,4,B007AFS1BI,"This package includes four Smithsonian documentaries.  Two of these, both running about 90 minutes, are outstanding.  One of these deals with the Concorde.  A joint venture between France and England, and designed to carry passengers at supersonic speeds, this airplane was a technical and engineering marvel, but a commercial failure.  The second deals with the space shuttle.  It recognizes the scientific triumphs, which included building the international space station and launching the Hubble telescope, while also noting two disasters, the losses of Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003.  The other two are essentially filler.  One is a tedious recapitulation of the Smithsonians air and space artifacts.  The other is a somewhat incoherent account of Americas first ten years in space, which brings together footage from diverse sources but does not integrate them into a useful narrative.  These could have been omitted.",1517184000,,932,5.507042253521127

8513281,5,B007AFS1BI,"This video is excellent. When I first told my husband about it, who was an engineer/scientist working in astronomy at CALTECH/JPL for his entire career, he thought it would be a waste of money but I figured there wasn't much to lose. Well, he was impressed. I'm so thrilled I went ahead and bought it.",1464480000,,301,4.490909090909091

8513285,5,B007AFS1BI,I really love this cd. It is a great look at the space program. Would recommend to others. Great addition to a collection of NASA items. Great viewing.,1392422400,,151,4.428571428571429
8513286,4,B007AFS1BI,"Disc one contains the first three programs.  America's Hangar was released earlier on it's own disc.  It talks about all three Smithsonian facilities on the Washington mall, Silver Hill and at the airport, with select planes discussed.  Concorde: Flying Supersonic talks about the history of the SST, and concentrates to some degree on the July 2000 crash that was the beginning of the end, followed by the 9/11 drop in air travel.  History in HD: America In Space features an older NASA film from 1967 called America In Space: The First Decade with present day commentary inserts.  I think it would have been better to have used an optional separate audio commentary with captions for the hardware being viewed.  The extant film print used also has a scratched lead in and some frame losses at repaired breaks.

Disc two contains Space Shuttle: Final Countdown which covers the entire program from conception to the last flight.",1374278400,4,929,4.95483870967742
