8240272,1,B00114KYC8,"I really regret buying this video and wish it were returnable.  I work in an addictions treatment center and thought this might be a video that clients would enjoy.  Nope.  I was embarrassed that I showed it without screening it first.  There was not a lot of laughing in the room and I think they experienced some of the self-deprecating jokes as somewhat hurtful.  E.g., ""What's 60 feet long and has only three teeth?  . . . . The front row of an NA convention.""  Stony silence in the room.",1405728000,,492,4.4
8240273,5,B00114KYC8,"In my opinion, as a professional Co-occurring therapist working as a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor, this is the best investment you could make for your clients. I worked in Private Practice and in a VA hospital. This series moved many of my clients to see addiction in a different way. There was/is no doubt that the time spent on this series was well worth it and had many positive results. I know a family member responded well to it, as I got them one for Christmas last year, and they related that they saw this at a treatment center that they attended.

Do your clients a service and get this series.

 I only wish they had a higher rating then 5, a 10 would be more appropriate!. I suspect Mark Lundholm has been a part of many folks recovery and helped in saving many lives!
I am fortunate that I have seen the series and used it in the field of addiction. I welcomed the opportunity to rate, comment and  share my experience.

8240274,5,B00114KYC8,"Our program had money to spend, so I bought this on a whim.  My groups LOVED it!  He is honest, funny, poignant, and emotional in a beautiful way.

Very little profanity or inappropriate content, and all used for real emphasis, not just gratuitously.

He is great for all of the substances of abuse- the entire room was nodding and laughing throughout.

Expensive, but very worth the money.",1363305600,4,390,4.7611940298507465

8240276,5,B00114KYC8,"My patients are ""riveted"" to the screen when Mark is on. I recommend this program to anyone in the substance abuse treatment business.",1206230400,8,134,4.869565217391305
8240277,5,B00114KYC8,"Mark is highly entertaining, and also gets his point across about the devastation of addiction. I work in the field, and my clients instantly recognize themselves in Mark...the humor and the pathos. He is really funny when portraying the addict; and he tears up when reflecting on the pain. And he also gives people hope...which is probably the best part of his show. He's a gift to recovery....",1204070400,9,395,4.823529411764706
