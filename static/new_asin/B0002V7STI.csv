8032291,3,B0002V7STI,"This is not a great movie. It's an interesting one. A really interesting one. Turns out that back in the 60s, Pakistan was kinda cool and not a terrorist supporting, two-faced hell hole that it is now. Doesn't mean that there's not some weird stuff to be had though with the religious police.

The movie starts with an awesomely silly darn scientists ruin everything title card. Most likely, it was censor required. It basically says scientists are bad and should've read that Koran more cause now we got those Christian style vampires due to a Jekyll and Hyde formula. All joking aside, it really does come off that way. It just sounds funny when said or read. The movie doesn't getting any less loony from there. Once the vampire shows up, a Euro style castle does too, a bunch of dance numbers, and finally a chase set to the Barber of Seville like a Bugs Bunny cartoon show up in rapid succession.

Like I said, it's not a great film but it's interesting to watch them co-opt various bits of Western culture to promote a proper viewing of their state religion. It's just as interesting to see them enjoying miniskirts and 60s style night club music. I'm glad it's been recovered cause it's important to see what's been lost as the great fundamentalist crusade rages on over there.",1453334400,2,1284,4.62719298245614

8032294,5,B0002V7STI,"Apart from the rare film with English subtitles, there is a running commentary, plus interviews with the director and actors about how the film was made and the censorship problems it faced. The only unsatisfactory item is the documentary on South Asian Horror Cinema. It begins with the Ramsay Brothers and the cheesy products they churned out from the 1970s onwards. Our film predates the Ramsays and Bhakris, and goes back to a far more respectable tradition of mainstream horror/suspense films, beginning with MAHAL in the 1940s.

8032296,2,B0002V7STI,"After reading the encouraging reviews here on Amazon, I excitedly purchased this film hoping to find a truly unique genre classic. What a shock to discover that this 1967 Pakistani Dracula is a pirated version of Hammer Film's 1958 masterpiece, Horror of Dracula! Unlike other notable film ""remakes"" of the past such as, Sergio Leone's, Fistful of Dollars, (a literal westernization of Akira Kurosawa's sardonic samurai film, Yojimbo), The Living Corpse is sadly inept and amateurish in its execution.
Firstly, it is a black and white film set in current times that lacks the atmospheric impact of either Mario Bava's period monochrome classic, Black Sunday or Hammer's gloriously sumptuous colour work. (Horror of Dracula was nominated for a Best Color Photography Academy Award!)
Taking into consideration cultural acting differences, the performances are still strangely unconvincing and weird. Watch the brother as the Van Helsing character knife/stakes his sister!
Dance sequences in a Dracula film?!? Only Roman Polanski's, Dance of the Vampires really pulled that one off! With the exception of the first (yes-- first!) dance sequence in Corpse, the other three routines are jarringly edited into the story with almost no connection to the plot whatsoever! One routine is actually about how wonderful life is on the beach! And one dance is missing from the film according to the DVD features! To call the seductive solo female dancers ""rubenesque"" is a kind understatement! Ah well, to each his own!
All the major sequences and plot turns from Horror of Dracula are reconstructed in this movie right down to the camera set ups. Watch the first appearance of Dracula on the top of the stairs, Dracula in his coffin, close up of female vampire biting man's neck, etc. Film majors would be in for a treat if they double billed Horror of Dracula and Living Corpse; they would learn much about what makes good film making and what doesn't! It is indeed, an amazing feat to copy so much of a great movie and make it boring!
Now, the music... as incredible as it seems, director Sarfaraz has actually stolen all of the major musical cues from Hammer's Dracula as composed by James Bernard! His composer has tried to disquise this fact by superimposing creepy string arrpeggios and scare chords over Bernard's score! Watch the ending as Dracula wiggles helplessly on the floor... you can even hear Peter Cushing's pair of candleabra crashing together to form his makeshift crucifix from Horror of Dracula on the soundtrack! Of course this sound has no function in the Pakistani film at all! I'm not going to even mention the Latin dance jazz cuts used in scenes where the tension is supposed to build!
In fairness, the director states in an interview that Pakistani filmmakers typically take scenes from favorite foreign films and reconstruct them in theirs. If this film had had international release in 67, the filmmakers would've been sued by Hammer Films. (As Leone was by Kurosawa Productions!)
Ironically, the DVD is put together quite professionally presenting special features well and with an astonishingly good print which makes the filmmaking look even worse!
All in all, Mondo Macabro's Living Corpse is a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" wherein if the powers that be exclaim a lost classic in a fancy package, the naked truth is quite the opposite!
Enjoy! You deserve it.",1105833600,10,3387,5.05
8032297,5,B0002V7STI,"Well I was surprised to see a vampire film from Pakistan in such a good quality. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Dracula movies.
  It's not like a typical Pakistani film, it has action right from the start and it's very enjoyable.",1073088000,,241,4.454545454545454
8032298,5,B0002V7STI,"This film will go down in history as the first film EVER to be gived the dreaded ""X"" FOR ADULTS ONLY certificate in the country of its origin.  The film was due to be banned outright until the producers literally pleaded with the local censors to see reason..the censors relented but insisted that they would never allow a film of this nature to be released ever again!
The DVD is an essential commodity for all genre (horror) fans....its brilliantly shot and very atmospheric and stylishly made, and even includes a couple of short musical numbers to give it that eastern touch.  essentially the film is a remake of the classic Hammer production HORROR OF DRACULA with enough of an eastern touch to give it its own character and individuality.  the DVD comes loaded with a cartload of goodies.....from the great Mondo Macabro channel 4 programme on Weird S. Asian movies to a commentary track, interviews, a making of, poster galleries, lost song included, the censors report........loads and loads to make this an essential buy.
An essential BUY for any true horror movie fan!",1063152000,7,1078,4.879781420765028
