I really love this video. I bought it 4 years ago after getting the final Spotlight DVD collection (whose exclusion of two shorts, one of which is included on this program, disappointed me). MGM didn't always use the best prints for T&J cartoons when they issued tapes in the 1980's-90's, but at least they had the advantage of leaving most of their shorts untouched (I'm criticizing YOU, Warner Bros.) When WHV released ALMOST all of the Hanna-Barbera T&J shorts in 2007 after three years of annual 2-disc sets, they skipped over 2 cartoons (""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat"", the latter of which is included in its entirety on this video). They claim ""political correctness"" to be the reason, but it's more like ""corporate greed"" if you ask me- just search online for their MOSTLY complete sets from China and UK which are missing other shorts for unknown reasons and you'll know what I mean!

Speaking of which, WHV recently announced the second volume of their T&J ""Golden Collection"" series which, AGAIN, is missing those two shorts removed from the final Spotlight Set in 2007. Forget it, WHV. I've already made my own complete set from the Spotlight Collections, the Chuck Jones and Gene Deitch shorts from the UK, this tape and ""T&J 50th Vol. 3"".

Highly recommended for all ""Tom and Jerry"" completists.",1251504000,2,1373,4.9094827586206895
