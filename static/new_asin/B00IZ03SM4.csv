8646720,5,B00IZ03SM4,"Fascinating story of a brilliant artist who painted what the Masters ""may have painted"".  He is incredibly gifted and deserves to be respected in his own right. Yes, he went about game in a dishonest way but no one got hurt and when discovered, art collectors decided to keep his gorgeous brilliant paintings anyway!!",1401580800,4,317,4.87037037037037
