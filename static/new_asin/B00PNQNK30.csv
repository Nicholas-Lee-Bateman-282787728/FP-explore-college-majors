8688898,3,B00PNQNK30,"Kultur misleadingly labels this 2-DVD release as ""a major new series"" when, in fact, it's been around since 1997, the year it was produced in England.  Each 25-minute segment tackles themes from six Shakepeare plays, namely: Macbeth, Julius Caesar, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello and King Lear.  Using extensive video clips produced by the RSC, taken from both filmed productions (for example the Macbeth with Jason Connery) and also segments filmed specifically for this series, the program also features extensive interview clips with Professor Stanley Wells, Dr. Robert Smallwood, and Dr. Russell Jackson.  Taken from video tape sources, the picture is soft and occasionally flickers, and it's in a square 1.33:1 format.  The themes tackled include such topics as: ""The relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth,"" ""The Conflicts Within Brutus,"" ""Oedipal Jealousy in Hamlet,"" ""The Nurse as a Comedic Role in Romeo & Juliet"" and so on.  Needless to say, 25 minutes isn't enough time to do any of the plays justice, and the dry, stage-bound performances and academic subject matter seem to aim this series at a University audience.  It's well-produced for its time, but shows its age, and won't be of much interest to casual Shakespeareans.",1423008000,17,1247,5.2727272727272725
