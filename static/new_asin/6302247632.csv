7823594,3,6302247632,"This is a pretty bad movie.  Filmed and (I think) financed in South Africa.

There's only one reason to see this: Holly Palance.  She's not even the female lead, if I remember right, but she's smokin' hot in this movie.  She's Jack Palance's daughter and used to host ""Ripley's Believe It or Not"" with him.  She was also the nanny who hung herself in front of the birthday party in the original classic, THE OMEN (1976) and she was one of the wives in THE BEST OF TIMES.

Anyway, if you ever wanted to see, to put it more nicely, a more sensual side of her, check this movie out.  The overall movie is pretty bad but if you had a thing for Holly, you won't care.",1148083200,2,662,4.165354330708661
