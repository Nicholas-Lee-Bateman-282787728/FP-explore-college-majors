I am in Melissa Joan Hart Hell! This Act of God is presented in a scrunched-up full screen format. MJH sticks to her less-than-one-minute onscreen time, as stated in her contract clause.",1364256000,,335,4.894736842105263
8242769,5,B0011VIOA0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but it was a delightful little film! Coming from an Italian family, this movie really hit home. The humor is spot on, where Italian families are concerned that is, and the other character is Irish, so putting these two into the mix makes for some hilarious situations. I really loved this movie, and would recommend it to anyone who needs a nice movie that will make you laugh and smile!",1344816000,,433,4.493670886075949

8242771,5,B0011VIOA0,This is a really good movie for some laughs and to make you think about life. I enjoyed it very much - maybe because I'm Catholic and there are not many Catholic movies out there that aren't over the edge.,1240876800,2,205,4.15
8242772,5,B0011VIOA0,"I don't know if the movie, Jesus, Mary and Joey, would make a 'Best Ten Catholic Movies' list, but it certainly is a movie that would be enjoyed and appreciated by Catholics.  I'd never heard of it until I saw it and bought it at a video store a couple days ago.  My wife and I watched it this evening, and we were simply captivated by it.  The movie is classified as a romance and a comedy, a romantic comedy, but it is much, much more than that because it all revolves around the character's relationship with Jesus.

One Sunday, Joey went to Mass as usual.  But that Sunday he spotted a beautiful, almost angelic-looking blond for the first time.  It turned out that she, Mary, had gone to Catholic school with Joey years before, but had moved and they forgot about each other.  They strike up a friendship, but it soon becomes apparent that Mary has a very close relationship with Jesus.  She had gotten sick in the intervening time, and her family had come to accept her pending death.  But, during a time the family was gathered around her, all hope lost, she received a Divine healing.  Having, myself, received such a healing, her description of what actually happened to her was almost identical to what happened to me.

Mary's palpable faith challenges Joey's faith and causes him to seek a closer relationship with Jesus.  Although a lifelong Catholic, what he experiences could be described as a 'born again' experience.  Like a  lot of new converts, his joy is something he can't keep contained within him.  His friends sort of make fun of his new 'religiosity,' and even his family can't understand him.  Their ongoing, traditional Catholic faith suits them just fine.  Joey's mother talks to her parish priest, and he gives a very wise (and Biblically correct) answer to her.

Mary's father, likewise, can't understand her effervescent joy in her faith.  Alarmed at the growing romance between Mary and Joey, uncomfortable with having two 'Evangelical Catholics' to contend with, he finds a job for Joey a couple hundred miles away in New York City.  With his best friends all trying to get Joey off his 'Jesus' kick, he finally breaks up with Mary and goes to the city.  However, the focus only on making money on Wall Street just isn't satisfying to Joey.  So, one lunch hour he goes into a financial district Catholic church to pray.  I won't tell you exactly what happens, but I am sure that to all good Catholics -  and even Protestants - it will prove satisfying.

This movie, while giving the message that each Christian has his or her own purpose in life, and that each Christian's experience of their relationship with Jesus may be a little different, never drops into the 'preaching' mode.  Unlike a lot of recent heavily promoted Protestant movies, it does not try to throw everything into one movie.  It is a very realistic portrayal of the Christian experience, but done in a lighthearted manner.  It is always very respectful of the Catholic, Christian faith.  I don't know why this movie isn't in every Catholic or Christian book store DVD section.  It should be there.",1232928000,6,3099,4.70631970260223
