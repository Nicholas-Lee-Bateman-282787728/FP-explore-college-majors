6403976,5,B00K7BCWLW,"Ichabod is the star for me as I think the original source material by Washington Irving, written in 1820, is very interesting. I read the short story as a lad of 9 or 10 and loved it then as well as today. Disney got Bing Crosby to be the narrator and he turned out to be absolutely perfect for the job!. The animation and sound work in perfect harmony here.

Picture was perfect and sound was probably better than when it was first released in 1949.

Mr Toad has also been a favorite of my since I was very young. I first read this in the Westfield, IN Library when I was even younger that of Ichabod - I was probably 7 or 8. I used to go to the library sometimes after school and just read for fun - usually picking books at random.

But anyway the 'Wind in the Willows' was one I found most interesting. When I rode the ride in Disney World I was a little disappointed as I felt it didn't do the book justice. However the Disney animated version with Basil Rathbone is superb!. Once again the picture and sound was about as good as it can get on this Blu-ray!

Mickey and the Beanstalk was pretty good as well but not as good as the other 2 above. Picture and sound was great.

I didn't care as much for 'Bongo' story wise - it just wasn't as good as the other 3.

I did think the short, ' The Reluctant Dragon' was cute!

Run time all together was almost 2 hours and 30 minutes.

Overall  - I would rate this a 8.25 to 8.75 out of 10 (but Ichabod is a 10 out of 10!)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED OVERALL!!",1410134400,3,1500,4.054237288135593
6403977,5,B00K7BCWLW,"This DVD and Blu-ray set features two films that Disney released in the 1940s. The first is 1949's The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad and the other is 1947's Fun and Fancy Free. Each film is essentially two short films combined.

The first segment of The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is The Wind in the Willows. Mr. Toad (Eric Blore) is the excessively wealthy and excessively reckless owner of Toad Hall. His disruptive behavior in the community eventually gets him in trouble with the law. The second segment is The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Ichabod is the selfish schoolteacher who arrives in Sleepy Hollow, New York who clashes with Brom Bones, a sort of town bully.

Fun and Fancy Free features Bongo, a segment where the titular bear escapes from his life as a circus performer to live in the forest, and Mickey and the Beanstalk, a retelling of the classic story that features Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy.

As a bonus feature, this set also includes the 1941 film The Reluctant Dragon which features a couple of animated shorts and also a (staged) tour of the Walt Disney Studios.

I found this set to be an excellent presentation of two classic Disney films. The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is fun and very enjoyable. Fun and Fancy Free is a little weaker. I thought the Bongo segment was too slowly paced and sometimes boring. However, this set presents both films well and I would recommend this to lovers of Disney animation.",1410048000,2,1461,4.673151750972763
6403978,5,B00K7BCWLW,"This Blu-Ray brings together two of my favorite films from my childhood, made at a time when the Disney studio was having trouble financing full-length animation features. Te Ichabod and Mr Toad films were frequently shown on the various incarnations of Disney's television shows in the 1950s and 1960s, while Fun and Fancy Free animation and live action was popular at the box office. I enjoyed both when I was a youngster; I still enjoy them. Your children will too.",1410048000,,468,4.8625
6403979,5,B00K7BCWLW,"These are two great Disney short movies that are fun, but have have relatively not known by all in the past, so I was glad to see them re-released for a whole new generation! In watching these I have to say that for me the story of Ichabod was my favorite as a child and is still my favorite today. I love the story, the music and the animation. This is one that I think will be a Halloween classic for years to come now that I have it in my Disney movie library! The other movies/shorts on this were also fun. My kids are always fans of Mickey so they loved seeing him in something new and they had never experienced the Wind in the Willows before either so now, not only do we have a good movie, but in telling them about the book, they now want to read the book too! As always Disney has done it right and I love that they put all these together in one collection!

6403980,4,B00K7BCWLW,"I wanted to point out that this release (Adventures of Ichabod & Mr Toad / Fun & Fancy Free 2-Movie Collection) also features The Reluctant Dragon. This is not just the cartoon short, but the 74 minute live action film with animation. Though I could imagine families with small children being bored with this feature, it's a fantastic addition for collectors and children who are curious as to how the older Disney films were created. This bonus film is like a time capsule for people with an interest in animation, and while animation has changed over the years, this film gives the viewer a look at Disney studio operations and the various departments that were required for making an animated film. It's all in fun and by no means a serious documentary, but if you ever wondered what it was like behind the scenes at the Walt Disney Studio when Walt Disney was alive, this is a fun way to do it.",1408492800,3,898,4.549382716049383

6403987,4,B00K7BCWLW,"Very sharp, crisp version of these classic cartoons. FYI, the bonus feature on the Fun and Fancy Free menu is actually another classic Disney film, The Reluctant Dragon. If you watch this, plan on another Hour and 15 minutes of movie time. It's really good though
I've recently begun purchasing older disney movies and cartoons to get myself pumped-up for our trips to Disney World.
Fun and Fancy Free is also the last movie that Walt Disney was the voice of Mickey. And Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is of course, a great movie for the kids for Halloween.

6404003,4,B00K7BCWLW,"If you're familiar with the three films (yes, three) on this Blu-ray disk, you might want to skip to the end, which discusses image quality.

After WWII, the Disney studio was in financial shambles. In an attempt to make money quickly, Disney released a number of ""compilation"" films, none of which was particularly successful with critics or crowds. ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr Toad"" combines ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" with ""The Wind in the Willows"". The latter is a surprisingly faithful rendition of the book's central story -- Toad's friends trying to get him to behave responsibly (which works well in an animated film) -- but the quieter, more-reflective parts of the book are missing. (Walt even said that the book didn't lend itself to animation.). I find it unengaging (others like it), though Eric Blore's performance as Toad is a pleasure.

""Ichabod Crane"" is a hoot, though, one of Disney's very best short films. Everything about it is suited to animation, especially Crane's homely features and gangly body, and the final confrontation with the Headless Horseman -- arguably one of the great sequences in the history of animation. With Bing Crosby carrying the singing and story-telling duties, there's zero dialog, with lets the animators focus on what they do best.

""Fun and Fancy Free"" is a similarly mixed bag. ""Bongo"" is a circus bear, in a story written by Sinclair Lewis (!!!), who longs for the wild life. It's cute the first time you see it -- and that's it. ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" might not be a high point of Disney animation, but it holds up to repeat viewings.

If this disk held only these two films, it would be of questionable value. What saves it is the third, ""The Reluctant Dragon"". Robert Benchley * is pestered by his wife (played by an actress) to show ""The Reluctant Dragon"" (supposedly written by his nephew (it was actually written by Kenneth Grahame 32 years earlier)) to Walt Disney as a possible film. On arriving at the studio, he's given a tour, and we get some (not much) insight into how animated films are made. (The RCA Sonovox demonstration is particularly interesting.) When Benchley walks into the room where paints are mixed, the film switches to handsome Technicolor.

This, too, is a compilation film, with the storyboards from ""Baby Weems"", a not-very-interesting tale about a genius infant (I suspect the story had already been abandoned, and this was a good way to recycle it); the Goofy short ""How to Ride a Horse""; and the title work. The latter two are excellent, and worth repeated views. And then there's Benchley, who's always a delight.

I have no hesitation recommending this set (which includes DVD versions). Just don't be surprised if you don't like every last thing in it.

These films have been given transfers from the original three-strip Technicolor negatives many other Disney features have received. Though this is a general improvement (""Ichabod"" no longer looks dark and grungy), the fact remains that no attempt has been made to get the hue and saturation right. Technicolor was a less-than-perfect process, and the artists often used the ""wrong"" colors to get the right effects in the projection print. If this isn't corrected, the result can be a garish clash of over-saturated hues.

""Ichabod"" is particularly bad in this respect, as such errors don't work well with a story about the supernatural. This is also true of ""Mr Toad"", a bucolic story where bright colors are out of place. The same problem exists in ""Beanstalk"" and ""Bongo"", but isn't too annoying, as the subjects can tolerate it.

""The Reluctant Dragon"" has some beautiful Technicolor photography inside the Disney studios. Though the lighting is necessarily flat to accommodate Technicolor's limited tonal scale, the hues vary from near-pastel to highly saturated, and are consistently pleasing.

* Benchley was at the time a famous writer and comic. His best-known relative is his grandson, who wrote a popular book about a big, dangerous fish.",1416096000,2,4006,4.974588938714499

I am a Halloween lover and have watched many a scary movie but the part where Ichabod is traveling home through the woods on his horse STILL makes me nervous. Disney does an excellent job setting the mood with the variety of sounds and lack of loud music (if any music at all) right before the Horseman shows up, you almost feel like you're there, too.

Great combination here of two Disney classics with two decent supporting stories, Mr Toad being the more entertaining of those two supporting efforts. Great Blu Ray presentation. Recommend highly.

6404012,5,B00K7BCWLW,"While billed as a 2 Movie Collection on the cover this blu-ray release it actually features five Disney films although they are mid-length features instead of full length features.  Disney would take two of these mid-length features, which would run usually 30  35 minutes each and combine two of them into a theatrical release.  This collection features The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad along with Fun and Fancy Free.  Fun and Fancy Free includes Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk and the Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad includes The Wind and the Willows and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  These four featurettes were all based upon well-known childrens and folk tales.

Bongo was written by the great American novelist, Sinclair Lewis.  Bongo is a bear who performs in a travelling circus but he longs to break free from captivity and live free in the world.  Bongo meets a girl bear and falls in love but has to fight another bear named Lumpjaw to win her affections.  Bongo is narrated by Dinah Shore.

Mickey and the Beanstalk is the Disney adaptation of the well-known fairy tale.  Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are poor and starving and decide to sell their cow.  But Mickey instead trades the cow in for some magic beans.  A furious Donald throws down the beans which sprouts vines that carry their little hut far into the clouds where the meet Willie the Giant who has stolen their villages magical harp.  This would be the last Disney animated feature where Walt Disney provided the voice of Mickey Mouse.  This may very well be the best of Disneys mid-range animated films.  Beautiful animation combines with a magical story filled with heart and humor.

The Wind and the Willows was written by Kenneth Grahame and is an adaptation of the childrens classic.  This is a well done take on the story about the comically irresponsible Mr. Toad whose frivolous and careless ways with money gets him thrown in prison when hes accused of stealing a car.  Toad was cheated however by a gang of weasels and Toads friends help him escape from prison so he can restore his reputation.  The Wind and the Willows was only released on DVD for the first time in 2009 and finally makes its way to blu-ray.  This is a beautifully animated tale from the height of Disney quality featuring narration by Basil Rathbone.

Finally we come to my favorite in the set, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  I believe I have seen every film or animated version of the Washington Irving early American ghost story but had not seen this one in years.  The story is narrated by actor/singer Bing Crosby who relates the tale of schoolmaster Ichabod Crane who arrives in Sleepy Hollow in 1790 and immediately becomes smitten with Katrina Van Tassel, the beautiful daughter child of Baltus van Tassel, who is the richest man in the village.  However Ichabod has a rival for Katrinas love with local village tough guy and prankster, Bram Bones.

As Ichabod travels home late one evening after a party at the Van Tassels he is attacked by the sword wielding Headless Horseman.  The next morning Ichabods hat is found but there is no trace of the schoolmaster.  Was the horseman just Bram Bones in disguise or an actual ghost?

Crosby lends his voice to several songs in the film but the highlight is the harrowing chase through the woods as the Horseman pursues Ichabod Crane.  Still a highlight which should be required viewing every Halloween season.

Now there are no bonus extras but there is a bonus film.  Oddly enough the bonus is the full-length version of The Reluctant Dragon, also based upon a story written by Kenneth Grahame.  Its a rather interesting production which combines live action and separate animated segments.  Its also a film like the Wizard of Oz which starts out in black and white and switches to Technicolor after the first twenty minutes.  The tale of kights of yore features a dragon who is more interested in reading poetry than battling knights.  The wraparound live action story features humorist and actor Robert Benchley trying to sell the tale of the Reluctant Dragon to Disney and touring the studios.  Released in 1941 at the height of an animators strike, the film suffered due to protests during the time and never truly received the notoriety it deserved.  Not a classic by any means but an enjoyable and very different Disney film.",1411776000,6,4349,4.764705882352941

I think a easy way to sum this up is to say it did not age well at all.  This one would be better left in the vaults for ever as examples of animation with very poor stories.
