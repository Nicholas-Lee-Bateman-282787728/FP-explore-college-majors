8735186,5,B015ZXCS06,"Archaeologist Neil Oliver shares hosting duties with anthropologist Alice Roberts and alternating the narrative is enjoyable. Both are very knowledgeable in their respective fields and provide the latest information on the elusive Celts and the religious order that existed within their society, the druids. This two-disc set compliments Oliver's ""A History of Ancient Britain"" and is a welcome addition to our collection.",1520121600,,422,5.82258064516129
