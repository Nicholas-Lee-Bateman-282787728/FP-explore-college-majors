3595543,5,B001G3SVZ6,"Our family, especially my son, just can't seem to get enough of Mythbusters. Fortunately for us, Netflix carries almost the whole series. But who knows how long that will last. So I have finally decided that we would get the entire series, all 10 years of it, one by one as Christmas gifts for my son. But I already know that the rest of us are going to be watching these as well.

We've already watched all 22 episodes of season one and are already looking forward to season two as soon as we can get it. I highly recommend this type of tv episode series to anyone who loves the fun of science and of course, big explosions! Jamie's just got to have his big boom. If you enjoy solving problems with science and having fun at the same time, go for it. This is your meat.",1357689600,7,770,4.202702702702703
3595544,3,B001G3SVZ6,i bought the first season of mythbusters from the discovery store and found that that was a mistake! i ordered it the first part of september and they didn't ship it until the sixteenth of november! the episodes are good for a couple of laughs however i think the later seasons have higher quality content,1354579200,,305,4.5636363636363635

8303729,2,B001G3SVZ6,"I loved watching Myth Busters with my family when it aired on the Discovery Channel.  So when the kids suggested us getting them for Christmas I was all for it.  I was concerned that this didn't show that 'cc' or subtitles were available, but took the chance knowing that even if they weren't and I couldn't watch them, the rest of my family could still enjoy them.  They are not 'cc' or subtitled for the hearing impaired so it may not be fair to dock stars from the review.  Well, I'm docking starts from the review.  The reason being that I watched these on air and they were 'cc' then.  The information is there, but the manufacturer decided not to include it even though it would not have added to their production time or expense.  At least they did not falsely claim that 'cc' or subtitles were included (unlike another season).  For that I let them keep one of the stars.",1514764800,3,879,4.416149068322981
