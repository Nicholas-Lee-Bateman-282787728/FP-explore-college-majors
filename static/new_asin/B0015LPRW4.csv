8466893,3,B0015LPRW4,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the title and description is missing a vital point. This DVD is for fingerpickers only. Shouldn't they indicate that in the product description? They certainly do in the first sentence of the booklet. ""Hello, my name is Jim Kelly and welcome to acoustic finger style guitar."" Wow, that's not the name of this DVD Jim, it's called Accelerate Your Acoustic Guitar Playing."" Certainly any fingerstyle approach can be modified to a flatpicking but man that's some work now and defeats some of the right hand focus of this book's intent. I wouldn't have bought this had i known it was for fingerpicking only. That said, the book has great content for the intermediate to advanced fingerstylists:
