7886203,4,6305240159,"This vhs is worth it if you can find it for like 5 bucks. It's worth it for the Frank Shamrock fight in my opinion, I've always been a huge Frank Shamrock fan, and to see his battle with Jeremy Horn is great! This has some other good fights on it like Don Frye vs Mark Coleman, Mark Coleman vs Maurice Smith, Randy Couture vs Vitor Belfort etc etc but you can get a UFC 11-21 dvd box set off of ebay too so I really only bought this for the Frank Shamorck fight because that fight isn't on the UFC 17 dvd in the box set.",1216166400,,520,3.869158878504673
7886204,4,6305240159,"Great Fight Card for this event Williams and the HAMMERS bout is as we all know by now is something to see.

To leave off Shamrock V Horn & Liddell V Hernandez even though chucks bout was an alternate, still would have been nice to see both there debuts {horn & chucks} over say, two newton bouts or Tanks one dimensional bout.

At least that's what my copy from trimark has left off

come to think of it Andre Roberts Ain't On It As Well.

Because the first time i seen him fight was when he dogged it against Big Daddy In UFC19 Young Guns.

Other Than Key Battles left off Pretty good entry in the volumes of UFC. If anyone else has these key fights left off and know why please let me know.

7886205,5,6305240159,"John Peretti was brought into the UFC for one reason and one reason only; to provide the fans with competetive bouts. UFC XVII. was his second as the  matchmaker, to me his best.
The night started with a 4-man middleweight  tournament. It consisted of 4 very qualified fighters, who were eager to  show they were worthy of a future fight against Frank Shamrock. Names like  Dan Henderson, Alan Goes, Bob Gilstrap, and Carlos Newton were as good as  they came. Each fight, (except for one) was close and could have gone to  any of the participants. The best middleweight tournament.
The rest of  the card consisted of 3 heavyweight showdowns. Each fight was an  interesting matchup. The first fight between Mike Van Arsdale and Joe Pardo  was explosive. Van Arsdale's wrestling skills were pitted against Pardo's  Jiu-Jitsu. Fight number 2 had Brazilian fighting legend Hugo Duarte pitted  against ""Tank"" Abbott. Duarte's reputation was on the line, and  Tank was expected to be another fallen foe. It was an intriguing fight  because of Duarte's questionable background(beating Harold Howard, whoa!),  and Tank's not-so good record. The bout lasted only about a minute or so,  and we found who was the real joke. The final fight was originally supposed  to pit Heavyweight champion Randy Couture against former champ Mark  Coleman. Randy Couture for some reason could not defend his title, so a  replacement, Pete Williams was inserted as the challenger. This looked like  the biggest Superfight mismatch ever, and it was up until they begen the  fight. William's was a Lion's Den fighter, but with no real experience. His  chances of even surviving were slim. The result was the best KO in UFC  history, a great fight that will wear out your slow-motion on your VCR.",966470400,3,1767,4.959044368600683
7886206,5,6305240159,"Tank shows Hugo Duarte what a 'bully' he is in 60 seconds.  That'll  probably be the last time that someone whose biggest credential is 'beat  Harold Howard' shoots his mouth off about Tank.  Incredibly close  middleweight tournament.  Three out of four are some of the top fighters in  the world; Dan Henderson, Allen Goes, and Carlos Newton.  Newton is  incredible to watch.  He should have won the tournament, but Henderson  deserved it for coming back out after his war with Goes.  Story of the  night though was Pete Williams versus Mark Coleman.  Watch in slow motion  after Coleman gets knocked out.  Then watch it again.  Enjoy!",965606400,2,636,4.849056603773585
7886207,5,6305240159,"Carlos Newton, the smallest and lightest competitor, was fabulous, and should have won.  The Tank Abbott destruction of Hugh Duarte was a wonderful 60 seconds.",952646400,,159,5.36
