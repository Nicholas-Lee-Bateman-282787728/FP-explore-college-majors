1901131,5,B0000A1HS6,"Most people probably never herd of this film, I had a pretty good idea why after watching the trailer. It made it out to be a splatter type werewolf film of the supernatural variety. Those of you who have seen it know that is far from the case. Nothing kills a movie faster than misrepresenting it to the audience. I'm guessing some ignorant studio suit didn't know how to sell this as it is and made a tragic mistake; as a result. While it does have some parallels with the legend of the werewolf, it's not remotely supernatural at all. Nor does it have anything to do with the phases of the moon or lunar eclipses as the title may suggest. Someone told me that it was originally called ""Wolf Girl,"" but I can't confirm that. It probably should have been though. With all that being said, what is this film really about? This delightfully strange film seems to be asking this question. Is inner and outer beauty mutually exclusive concepts? There's a little freak in us all, it's just more obvious in some than others. What ultimately defines us is how we treat the freak in us. Do we accept it, or do we do something truly ugly to hide it? That's what I got out of it, and I hope you do too, but if you're one who shuns the freak in us all; I doubt that you will. While watching this movie I got the impression that this may be a thickly veiled allegory of someone's actual life. I even got a hint of sour grapes in the way that the antagonists were portrayed. Who can say for sure, but I do know that this film is a hidden treasure. One of my all time favorite horror films.",1108166400,4,1577,4.2425249169435215
1901132,4,B0000A1HS6,"In all the horror movies you've watched, haven't you always wanted to see one of the studly jocks stand in front of a mirror and examine his male organ, and see just how small he really is?  This scene is one marvelous and original idea that adds so much to the psyche of both the young man and the wolfgirl who witnesses his secret.  Shawn Ashmore (from ""X-Men"" and the current miniseries EARTHSEA) plays Beau, the aforementioned jock whose secrets (he's also scared silly in an earlier scene) become his downfall.

BLOOD MOON is quite unusual in that it's not a ""werewolf"" movie; it's a story of those loveable ""freaks"" who have become sort of a dinosaur in today's more PC conscious society.  However, director Thom Fitzgerald has found a talented bunch of physically challenged people and given them human characteristics and some of them are delightful in their strange musical numbers.  Tim Curry does a fine job as the ringmaster Harley Dune, whose initial manipulation of these people gives way to a man who views them all his children.  Victoria Sanchez (Pact with the Devil) plays Tara, the wolfgirl who just wants to be normal; Dov Tieffenback plays Ryan, the introverted nerd whose mother (Lesley Ann Warren in a tiresome role) has come up with a genetic injection which is a depilatory that removes hair.  Grace Jones, that amazonian music star from the eighties, does a nice turn as Chris/Christina, a combination male female role which she is perfectly suited for.

The movie's message is clearly ""Be pleased with who you really are.""  This is attenuated by the movie's tragic and somewhat disappointing ending.  However, what you have viewed before is not your standard horror fare and for that, the producers and people involved should be congratulated.",1102809600,,1770,4.909395973154362
1901133,5,B0000A1HS6,"A horror movie about a travelling circus of sideshow performers - called 'freaks' by some - moving about from town to town, and cast with a number of actors and actresses with real physical differences, ""Blood Moon"" could have  easily come off extremely tasteless.  Thankfully, that isn't the case.  The circus, including a 'Wolf Girl' falsely depicted as a wild beast in her performances, find no shortage of people willing to be entertained by their performances but who are often (not all the spectators, but many) still very taunting of them. The selfcontained circus subsociety is a superior society to the behavior of the scummy louts encountered in one particular town they pass through,although it's here where the gentle Wolf Girl meets and becomes friends with an introverted teenage boy tormented by the local thugs.  It's also here that she finds an experimental cure for her wolflike appearance, and with the help of her new friend, begins experimenting with the new drug.  Also, very tellingly, although a number of the townspeople are not cruel, it's among the children that Tara and the other performers find the most open acceptance, not shy about their curiousity about the new arrivals but not in a frightened, mocking or downlooking way, and they're not uncomfortable around the circus people, whereas the adults usually are.  I find this true to the nature of little children, that they're interested in the different but haven't yet learned that they're 'supposed' to be at ill ease with others's differences.

  The acting in ""Blood Moon"" is absolutely tremendous.  The most famous player is Tim Curry (""It""; Dr. Frankenfurter from ""The Rock Horror Picture Show""; ""Earth 2"") and he turns in the performance of his career as the ringmaster of the circus, who at first glance appears to be an exploitive manipulator subjecting his performers for financial gain but is quickly revealed as a benevolent father-like figure to the troupe (other than his love interest, of course) who's spent his life offering a place to outcasts from society, within the circus where they can find camraderie and even be appreciated for their differences instead of pitied or ridiculed (occasional cretins within the spectators excluded).  The Wolf Girl herself he's even saved from possible death after she was born in a remote village somewhere in the world where superstition reigns strong (perhaps unrealistically strong, one of the movie's few gaps in realism) and she was regarded as some kind of demon. Every other performer is top-notch too - Victoria Sanchez is superb as Tara the Wolf Girl, Grace Jones plays the transgendered Cristophe/Christine, Darlene Cates gives a tender and manificent turn as Athena the 'Fat Lady' (a mother figure to Tara), and the actor who plays Tara's newfound friend/emerging love interest (I'm terribly sorry, but I can't recall the name of either the actor or the character) is great, and the four performers who play the band of bullies are also awardworthy.  In fact, everybody is tremendous but I felt the need to single certain main performers out.

  As the 'cure' begins to work for Tara, though, a certain beastiality begins to rise within her, and the already tense movie becomes one of the scariest films in memory, with fierce-hitting frights and truly unnerving suspense. ""Blood Moon"" is an unorthodox horror movie, and has managed to tread some difficult ground with style and class, and has a definate message - it's unsettlingly real how the most mean-spirited and nasty characters fit in with society and are accepted because they have the right look and are seen as cool, while others are shunned because they appear different from the norm, regardless of their character.

  On a final note, I'd like to praise the film's subtle yet beautiful romantic elements that find time to softly shine amid all the more disturbing and scary elements.  Tara and her love interest's initial friendship turning to unspoken attraction to each other is handled wonderfully; two hurt, lonely souls coming together in a very touching way that compares extremely well with any onscreen love story.  And I agree with what another reviewer said: even in her hairy wolflike state, Tara is very lovely.  A lovely character on the inside too, which makes her heartbreak at the way she's often treated all the more heartbreaking, and makes it all the more potent when the very uncharacteristic savagery begins to emerge inside her as a result of her cure attempt.",1101081600,2,4498,5.043184885290149
1901134,3,B0000A1HS6,I didn't like this movie because when I bought it I read the summary thinking that there was going to be something like a lot of killing bloody scenes which I do enjoy this movie did not have that it just and ok movie,1095724800,,217,3.9545454545454546
1901135,5,B0000A1HS6,"I am a sideshow entertainer myself and I personally love this film! The direction was perfect and the plot very interesting. A very fun movie to watch. Ignore the person who said the cover is misleading. The cover is a metaphor for the entire film! It's not misleading at all. And on a personal note, I find the Wolf Girl ""Tara"" very pretty with all of her hair. Maybe I've just been ""with it"" too long. I don't know. But she is beautiful! You'll enjoy this film immensley! See you all down the road.",1094688000,,500,4.329787234042553
1901136,4,B0000A1HS6,"I bought this movie ""blind"", just because it had the great Tim Curry in it.  I was expecting another werewolf film in the style of American Werewolf In London/Paris, Wolfen, Howling etc., but what I got was a nice, little surprise! Tim Curry, is of course, excellent as always but there are some really nice performances by the whole cast. The freak show participants and their marvelous acts/dances/songs/tricks are mesmerizing to watch. Even Tim Curry sings a song along with the he/she character played by Grace Jones. The mother from ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" plays the ""fat lady"" and there is, of course, the geek, the sword-swallower, the fire eater, the impaler, midgets, contortionists and LOTS MORE!
The story, however, centers around the ""wolf girl"", Tara. Tara has trichno-something or other which causes hair to grow all over her body. She starts taking an experimental drug to become ""normal"" and that's when the bloodshed starts.
There are some really great scenes in this movie plus a couple of REALLY DOOZY SURPRISES!!!
If you liked the film, Freaks, like the TV show Ripley's Believe It Or Not, or just love and adore Tim Curry, you will enjoy this odd and strange movie!  Happy Watching!",1081382400,16,1209,4.9507389162561575
1901137,2,B0000A1HS6,"The only saving grace for this film was Tim Curry playing the perfect ringmaster of a sideshow.  One of the sideshow freaks is the wolf girl, who's really just a young woman covered with hair...she puts in fake fangs and claws and growls a lot for her act.  Four ne'er-do-well heckel her and the rest of the sideshow during it's stay.  Meanwhile, a young outcast pities the wolf-girl and gives her a serum his scientist mother made that may make her normal.  As she continues to use the ""medicine,"" though, we find that it has a reverse effect: the more human she appears, the more animal she becomes.
That sounds interesting, but it could've been done better...maybe without using full frontal (doctored?) male nudity?  Plus, I like my werewolf movies to have werewolves.  The cover is VERY misleading, there is no large beast in this film.  The only beasts are the heckling teenagers.",1064534400,4,886,4.751633986928105
1901138,4,B0000A1HS6,"I expected a mindless, fun, trashy little flick and was pleasantly surprised. Although it was disjointed and implausible in places, it posed a lot of pithy questions: What defines a freak? Someone with hair all over their body? No legs? A hermaphrodite? A violent bully? A self-pitying loner? A pretty but socially inept blonde girl with no true friends? A cold-hearted scientist who experiments on animals to further her career in cosmetic science? A charismatic huckster who feels most comfortable surrounded by the physically deformed? And why would a sweet, gentle young girl willingly turn into a monster just to become beautiful? Why wouldn't she? A lot of people do.

The only normal character in this film was the wolf (the real one), who mostly stood there looking bewildered at the antics of these crazy humans.

This film has a surreal, old-world quality with an undertone of eugenics. In one short but chilling scene, a scientist delivers a speech to a room full of white-coated, zombie-ish colleagues, telling them that people don't want to just seem normal; they want to be normal, and that science can help them. For instance, he tells them, ""brown eyes can be detected - and corrected - in the womb."" Third Reich, anyone?

The ending is deeply unsatisfying and disturbing, but I can't imagine it turning out any other way.",1327795200,,1338,4.937777777777778
1901139,4,B0000A1HS6,"This movie was great! Boy meats girl, boy & girl fall in love, girl gets hooked on boy's mother's experimental hair removal drug, drug works but turns girl into an animal, boy has to hunt down the monster he created, it's a tail as old as time! This film has everything: love, hate, nudity, blood, freaky fun, & a French kiss that'll knock your socks off!

As for the DVD itself, it was in good condition; worn, but not enough to mess up the movie.

I give the movie 4 stars & the DVD 3, overall 3 3/4 stars, you won't be dissapointed.",1326499200,,535,4.184466019417476

1901141,2,B0000A1HS6,"User reviews led me to rent this movie thinking it would be a decent enough horror flick but that just wasn't the case. This made for Canadian TV piece has its heart in the right place but is a pretty awful mess when all is said and done.

The story revolves around a ""Wolf Girl"" in a traveling side show that seems to be reaching the end of her rope as far as being an oddity is concerned. She wants to be normal. It just so happens a young outsider in a town in which the show makes camp has a mom who is working on treatment for losing unwanted hair. So they do the mad scientist thing and inject her with the serum even though it is untested and could have any number of horrible side effects. Yes, the stuff works and yes she has some pretty awful side effects, the main one being that she actually may be a werewolf and the serum might be bringing that to the surface.

She exacts revenge, during a nocturnal tirade, on one of the locals who, with a few of his friends, taunted her during her performance.

This, I suppose, is basically a good idea for a script, but it meanders terribly. There is nowhere near enough horror and her evolving relationship with her savior isn't explored well enough. They also spend too much time with the local degenerates who make all the trouble in the movie and show how they too are dysfunctional and have feelings of inadequacy. These people are buttholes and I don't want to sympathize with them. And why, after disrupting Wolf Girl's show one night by throwing excrement at her, is nothing done to them and they're allowed back into the show the following night? There are quite a few puzzling things like this happening throughout the film.

Tim Curry does a decent enough job but his performance just doesn't overcome the tepid script.

There are some OK moments here and there but the movie just doesn't seem settled on what it's trying to do so I say give this one a pass. If you're looking for horror there is a lot more out there to choose from.",1262822400,,1997,4.35752688172043
1901142,4,B0000A1HS6,"A savvy blend of psychological horror, satire, and black humor, this surprising film is a fascinating examination of humanness and normalcy, particularly in regard to beauty, gender, and sexuality.  The obligatory modern teen-flick shtick of pseudo-jock versus nerd is handled with an irony appropriate to the story, and the mad science versus ecology plot, though overstraining of credulity, is excusable in the midst of such a delightful hybrid of burlesque and horror.  The film is a feast for fans of Tim Curry, Grace Jones, and fat lady Darlene Cates, each of whom appears to relish his/her role.  And truly lovely Victoria Sanchez is so well suited to her wolf-girl portrayal that she could pass for the sister of real-life sideshower Jo-Jo the Dog-Faced Boy.",1237680000,,765,5.153225806451613

1901145,4,B0000A1HS6,"Don't be fooled by the silly cover art or the lame title.. this is a really good movie! After watching the movie I realized that the alternative title ""Wolf Girl"" which this film is (also known as) ..is a much more suitable title. The movie is more about her than any of the other side show entertainers. Everything revolves around her. There are many sights to see in the movie from Grace Jones as a half man half woman, Darlene Cates as a 600 pound + + size woman, midgets, deformed people plus, others that are harder to explain. Tim Curry plays a father figure to the young girl born wolf-like. He is sorta the same with the others in the freakshow but, more so with her. I think the movie kinda teaches a few valuable lessons that I will just let you experience for yourself. Each viewer will take away different things from the message the film holds but, I think I will stop judging people based on whats on the outside. ""3 1/2 stars""",1159401600,6,941,4.3522727272727275

7995507,3,B0000A1HS6,"The original title for this movie is Wolf Girl.  It is not, as the alternate title and cover art suggest, a movie about a werewolf.  It is also not a horror movie.  The genre it could best be identified with is science fiction (tampering with medical science, abusing a drug with disastrous results).  And even with that, it doesn't nearly explore that aspect to the fullest.  It's also, oddly enough, a musical.  Tim Curry does a number, Grace Jones performs two songs, there's a couple of song and dance routines, all interspaced between acts of bullying and angst.  Most bizarre.  The gist of the story relates to the need to fit in, to be normal (what is normal?).  According to the premise provided, everyone is a freak in some regard.  In this instance, two characters will do anything to achieve normalcy or the appearance thereof.  Wolf Girl risks her life on a supposed cure while Beau (Shawn Ashmore), thinks nothing of resorting to murder to keep Wolf Girl from blabbing his secret abnormality.  The whole thing is handled in a curiously detached manner.  It's an odd way to present such an important issue.  In the end, it doesn't adequately convey the necessary desperation we all feel to fit in.
The moral, careful what you wish for.

7995508,5,B0000A1HS6,"WOLF GIRL, or BLOOD MOON, as it is known internationally, is one of the finest achievements in Gothic Horror to arrive in decades. This tragic tale centers Tara, an afflicted young woman whose hypertrichosis has gained her renown as the terrifying ""Wolf Girl"" in Harley Dune's Travelling Freak Show. After being tormented by a group of unruly teens at one of their stops, Tara is approached by a timid admirer, who claims he can help restore her looks using an experimental drug. Tara begins the treatments, but as she takes on a more human appearance, her instincts become more wild and animalistic as she regresses into the mindset of a wolf.

WOLF GIRL is the most sincere and loving portrayal of human oddities since Tod Browning's FREAKS, exuding a sense of warmth and family between the players in Harley's sideshow. It places a firm emphasis on character and theme that only lightly touches on horror. Victoria Sanchez pours everything she has in to her performance as Tara, giving us a painfully sad and empathetic character with whom to relate. She wants nothing more than to be liked and to be loved, and is willing to risk her humanity if it means being accepted. Acceptance and appearance play a vital role in the development of the villains, as well. Through Beau and Krystal, we slowly begin to see the hidden imperfections that drive the teens to project their anxieties outwardly by attacking Tara. Interestingly enough, the characters with the most notable differences physically also show the most self-confidence and strength, as seen through Athena the Fat Lady and Ryan, Tara's scrawny but bold defender. Grace Jones performs a compelling music number that speaks towards inner beauty as the androgynous Christoph/Christine. Tim Curry is perfectly suited to play the role of the sideshow barker, Harley Dune, in another wonderful performance.

All that aside, WOLF GIRL is a clever reversal of traditional werewolf lore that offers a refreshing new take on the genre. Lori Lansens provides a carefully crafted and character-driven script that is masterfully brought to life under the direction of Thom Fitzgerald. The film is magnificently shot under a dark Gothic aesthetic, from the beautiful costuming to the timeless carnival backdrop and fantastic score by Christophe Beck. This is essential viewing for any Gothic Horror or werewolf fans.
