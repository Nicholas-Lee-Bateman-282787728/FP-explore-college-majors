8321902,5,B001MV5KRE,"This is by far my favorite yoga video, out of the ten or so I own and the dozens I've check out of my local library network. Excellent for all levels, calming but not too tree-hugger-esque (sorry, I'm personally not a fan of overly new age yoga. Just my preference.) It also features narratives from the participants, which I love. I appreciate that they featured participants that were somewhat diverse, too! Shows that everyone should at least try yoga!",1443830400,,455,4.772151898734177
8321903,5,B001MV5KRE,"I was diagnosed with MS and a friend told me about Hillary's DVD.  I purchased it immediately and Love it!!  I really appreciate the way she explains how to listen to your body.  I'm very active and have been wanting to add yoga to my routine, and  I'm so grateful
to have found Hillary!",1395014400,,287,4.2592592592592595
8321904,5,B001MV5KRE,"I love this dvd.  I'm not a yoga person but I try to do yoga once a week.  I don't always make it.  But ANYONE can do yoga with Hilary and get something out of the practice.  I'm in my 60s, not flexible, and enjoy the practices because they don't go on forever.  I can handle about 1/2 hr of yoga and Hilary fits the bill nicely.  Wish she'd make another dvd that's a step up from this Foundations dvd as something to continue with.",1326499200,5,432,4.023529411764706
8321905,5,B001MV5KRE,"I've been practicing yoga for over 10 years now, and Hillary's DVD is so refreshing. Not only is it professional and instructional in all the right places, I also really appreciated her heart-to-heart teaching style. I felt so inspired doing her program, that not only my body felt wonderful through the movement, but my emotional state felt good at being moved too. I felt safe doing her program, and completely trusted her instruction. I also loved some of the bonus materials - chair yoga being one - because I can do that at work right when I need to. This is a great program for beginners, or for folks like me who wish to really deepen into the practice.",1279843200,5,660,4.554621848739496
8321906,5,B001MV5KRE,Excellent yoga DVD for anyone new to Yoga in general or anyone new to Anusara Yoga as Hillary takes the time to break down the foundational principles of Anusara Yoga.  Hillary Rubin's teachings combine great inspiration with empowering alignment principles that help her students find stability and freedom both on and off the mat.  I've been practicing and teaching Anusara yoga for many years and frequently recommend this DVD to my own students.,1279843200,5,449,5.136986301369863
8321907,5,B001MV5KRE,"The DVD is incredibly well done and properly planned for user interaction. I have followed the rise and success of Hillary Rubin and would absolutely recommend her uplifting, motivational and spiritual mindset as it applies to yoga and life in general. If there is a Hillary Rubin product, DVD, book or other, BUT IT. You will not be disappointed.",1279843200,4,347,4.898305084745763
