7842388,5,6303234372,This short little movie is very nicely done. Aided by some comedic tones from Orson Welles. Just spooky enough to give you goose bumps. Really needs to be put out on DVD/Blu Ray.,1499472000,,178,4.424242424242424

7842391,5,6303234372,"This is an urban legend in the ""Vanishing Hitchhiker"" vein.  Pretty creepy, and atmospheric.  I like it.  And oh btw...  it has Orson Welles in it!  if that isn't reason enough to love it alone...  I'm going to convert it to DVD.",1374451200,,229,4.333333333333333
7842392,5,6303234372,"This is and old movie but is still scary. Usually the old black and white horror movies are dumb and stupid. but this one has an understandable plot and summary and is not ""cheesy"" like some of the other old horror movies. This movie had me on the edge of my seat!!",1204848000,2,265,4.115384615384615
7842393,5,6303234372,"The plot is spooky and yet very pleasant.  I fell in love with this movie since I first saw it.  It's getting rare and hard to find.  The bogdonavich introduction is excellent.  The harp music is beautiful and establishes the mood for the movie.  The movie was made circa 1949.  It has an incidental element of proper manners between people that is quite noticeable in contrast to this modern age of self-centered personalities.  The overall mood created by the movie is priceless.  The quote from the song of Soloman is charming and the movie is charming.  It also is sad because of the main character's discovery about the young girl's fate as dying without experiencing courtship and dying soon after her mother's death.  Like a bottle of fine wine, the movie is complex and yet simple.",1115942400,5,789,4.735294117647059
7842394,5,6303234372,"Ghost Story is old-fashioned, using familiar methods to induce a shiver, but is tremendously enriched by the playful appearance and narration of Orson Welles. His cameo as himself, driving off the set of Othello one  night and picking up a stranger with a mysterious story to tell, turns out  to be one the most perfect framing devices I've ever seen. Aside from that,  the film itself is very nicely done, it actually has a haunting quality,  due in no small part by the effective performances of Shelah Richards and  Helena Hughes, and the very assured and moody screen compositions of  director Hilton Edwards.",928713600,9,613,4.902912621359223
