8614418,5,B00FCAK3CS,"There was only one Elmore James, but a million slide guitar players who wanted to play like him ! He had fire in his playing and a grit and sting in his voice no other bluesman has come close to.  This DVD opens the door to his world of slide guitar, and it's a wild ride. A great introduction to his style and technique.",1400803200,,321,4.015625
