8249543,5,B0013A138O,"This double featured DVD is definitely a gold mine of credible, flawless, authentic acting by two great actors, Trevor Howard (Brief Encounter, The Third Man,  and Ryans Daughter), and Richard Burton (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, and one of Elizabeth Taylors husbands).

The Conflic/Catholics

First, let me tell you about this magnificent Brian Moores filmed story of The Conflict (a.k.a. Catholics).  If you like Trevor Howards acting ability, this role as an Irish Catholic Father Abbot is a character he plays well.  The monks monastery is situated in a somewhat isolated area by the sea where they celebrate the Mass in the traditional Latin language.  However, the Vatican wished to modernize the liturgy used in the Mass from Latin to the common laguage that the devotees use in their daily life.  The purpose is to bring the Catholic liturgy and its meaning closer to the understanding of the devotees.  Martin Sheen plays the Popes representative relaying this modernization mandate.  Resistence to change evolved among the traditionalist monks. Though personally and internally conflicted by harboring doubts with his own Catholic faith,  Father Abbott (Trevor Howard) was able to calm the monks to obedience to the Papal mandate.  Faith is a gift as well as a burden that is often shaken and renewed as oftentimes if one is lucky enough.  Howards  depiction of a beleaguered man of faith and obligation he portrayed is authentic. The wisdom and  strong leadership is totally credible.

Absolution

This is definitely Burtons film.  Burton plays a rigid yet nave, anguished priest teaching Latin in a Catholic Boys School. One day, a liberated drifter infiltrated the conservative system of the school by inhabiting the foresty area of the school environment.  He meets one of the students and succeeds in imbuing  twisted, paganistic ideas on the impressible youngster (Dominic Guard) who turned the school into chaos by playing a game of wit and psychological manipulations against Burton, the priest.  This senseless emotional fencing tormented the otherwise superficially chilly priest. The game turned out of control and resulted in violence and murder.

Absolution tests the reality of the confessional absolution and the sacred oath of its confidentiality. The film ends with an insanity driven Burton, the priest, in front of the chapel altar with his outstretched arms in the air in helpless despair.

This double featured DVD have impeccable acting. Highly recommended for matured viewing.  For the price of less than $5 dollars, your brain is titillated with entertainment and food for thought.",1379894400,,2621,5.247596153846154
