2470282,5,B000CQM4YM,So sad that Universal was too cheap to purchase original music rights to these episodes. Sam Beckett is leaping around to different points in time.

This series was really getting going by season four with every episode here (and in the subsequent season 5) a joy to watch!  The writing and directing matched the outstanding acting, especially that of Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell.  This truly unique series certainly should have gone on for a dozen season, but alas it was not to be.  Enjoy these seasons though.  They are outstanding television!",1398729600,,553,5.021978021978022

There was no rut in any of the seasons.  The fourth season is the amazing and continuing saga of Sam and his holographic friend and mentor Al.  If you like science fiction, drama, humor spiced with an amazing touch of humanity.....""Quantum Leap"" is just what you need.  Another wonderful bargain.",1385164800,,453,4.756410256410256

Otherwise I'm glad I got them.  I thought that it may be the player but it did the same on other one also.  Also there is movies on both sides of DVDs  so watch for that.  I just went on amazon and other  people must have problems. Trying on blue ray now  -  so if you don't have blue ray watch out!  I will report back if that doesn' t work.

This season continues the story of our intrepid Leaper, Sam, and he goes through some very good episodes. And, yes, there are a few dogs here. But even then, the writing is still consistently good. Sometimes ideas for plots just don't pan out the way you thought when you were brainstorming the ideas.

But they went for it with gusto and believed in the things they were doing in making this show.

Not Quantum Leap.  This series stands up to the test and shines on!  Scott Bakula is great as Dr. Sam Beckett and his sidekick al (played by Dean Stockwell) keeps the humor going.  You won't be sorry watching this series.  A definite buy!",1238889600,,413,4.230769230769231

It has fast become one of my favorites too. We have enjoyed many nights watching these episodes.",1235433600,,249,4.434782608695652
2470334,5,B000CQM4YM,"I would have to say that Quantum Leap is one of my favorite televisions shows of all time.  The key behind the success of this show was the chemistry between Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell.  The manner in which these two actors interact is really the heart of Quantum Leap.

The premise of this show is basically Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) leaps (euphuism for time travel) into a person's body in order to ""make right that once went wrong"".  When Sam leaps into a person his only guide is Al (Dean Stockwell).  Al is from the same time Sam is from and steps into a chamber that allows only Sam to see Al as a hologram.  Al provides insight on what Sam is suppose to do in order to ""leap"".  The hope is that Sam will leap home (back to his own time).  Mind you there is a bit more to this show, but this is the series in a nutshell.

 The thing that made this show so wonderful is that each week the theme of the show would be different, due to the fact that Sam would be ""leaping"" into different scenarios.  One week the show would be a comedy, a drama, an adventure, a romance, a thriller and so forth. Quantum Leap sadly only ran for five seasons before it was cancelled.

I have to say that out of the ninety-six episodes made there really isn't one that I don't like.  I choose to review season four because this season was very dark and edge. This might not seem like much of a big deal today, but in 1991/1992 the playing field on public television was a little different.  There were twenty-two episodes in season four of Quantum Leap the following are some of the darker and edger episodes:

- Hurricane: Sam leaps into a sheriff who must stop a woman from being killed by a hurricane, or perhaps an ex-lover?

- Justice: Sam leaps into a man who just joined the Ku Klux Klan and must prevent a black civil rights leader from being lynched by the Klan.  This is a great episode that touches many social issues.

- Permanent Wave: Sam leaps into a hairdresser who is living with a single mother and her son.  When the child witnesses a murder, Sam must keep the killer from slaughtering the boy.

- Raped: Sam leaps into a girl named Katie, who has just been raped. Sam has to make sure the person who raped Katie is brought to justice.  However, the only suspect is the town hero.  This episode really pushed the envelope.

- Dreams:  Sam leaps into a cop investigating a multiple homicide.  However the haunting childhood memories this cop has experienced are now affecting Sam.

- Running For Honor: Sam leaps into a cadet at a Naval Academy who might be homosexual.  Sam must stop his former roommate (who is gay) from being killed via a hate crime.  This episode also really pushed social issues.

- Temptation Eyes: Sam leaps into a television reporter in San Francisco.  Sam ends up working with a psychic on solving a murder.  The twist is that this psychic knows that Sam is a time traveler.

- Moments to Live: Sam leaps into a soap opera star that is kidnapped by his number one fan, which happens to suffer from borderline personality disorder.

- The Curse of Ptah-Hotep: Sam leaps into an archeologist who finds a Pharaohs' tomb and curse.

- Leap for Lisa: Sam leaps into Al when he was still serving in the military. Al is put on trial for murder of his commander's wife.  Sam makes some dubious choices that result in changing Al's future and not for the better!

As for the DVD set itself there are three dual sided discs, not my personal favorite.  I would prefer six discs to the three dual sided.  As for special features......there really aren't any.  I must be honest, special features would have been great but I am just so happy that these shows are available on DVD.  From my understanding Universal has changed some of the music played in certain episodes for copyright reasons.  It had been so long since the original shows aired and when this DVD was released that I don't even remember where the music was changed. Let the record state I am not thrilled that some of the music has been changed, but I am not going boycott the show or this DVD set.

Quantum Leap was a great show that really was different.  I think that was both its curse and blessing.  These episodes, for the most part, have aged nicely and since the show is about time traveling there is an ageless aspect.  Many modern television shows could learn a lesson from Quantum Leap",1232496000,3,4387,4.408468244084682

2470336,5,B000CQM4YM,"My brother told me about the episode ""Running For Honor"" when it aired in Australia in the early nineties - but I had to wait for the DVD (in 2007) to see it myself. I'm impressed with how entertaining this episode is, while also dealing with a wide range of the issues around homophobia (including internalised homophobia).

I particularly appreciate that Sam is totally at ease in his temporary new skin as naval sports jock Tommy - readily accepting Ziggy's strong prediction (86%) that Tommy is gay.

Previous seasons of Quantum Leap have informed us that Sam Beckett is honest, compassionate and refreshingly free of prejudice. And so in this program Sam quickly pulls Al back into line for making ill-informed value judgements about Tommy's natural mannerisms.

This show has relevance to gays to the military - but it's really a universal statement that homophobia is everyone's problem.

I've always had a crush on Scott Bakula (and a boyhood crush on Dean Stockwell). I now have even more respect for these two fine actors.

The Season 2, 3, and 4 DVD sets replaced several of the original songs from the series with different music including some generic and likely unknown or unrecognized background music.

There were at least 28 songs that were omitted from the Season 2 DVD as per a quantumleap fan club web site that I read. Under the Audio/Video Information section on that same web page, you can also see an example of this audio replacement and what a difference the soundtrack can really make. Even I was surprised! It is like doing a full 180! It is a total disapointment.

You can google the words Quantum Leap Music Replacement and find all kinds of information on this.

I'll have to investigate the British sets.",1144022400,10,346,4.733333333333333
2470350,3,B000CQM4YM,"First and foremost, I must say that I've been a die-hard fan of ""Quantum Leap"" ever since its original airing during the third season.  With that being said, I was disappointed with the music changes as one can imagine.  Admittedly, there are some music omissions that can actually be overlooked, but in particular, there is one omission that cannot.  This comes in the episode ""Temptation Eyes"" with Foreigner's ""I Want To Know What Love Is."" While the cheap music that replaced it has a romantic tone, it still nearly destroys the impact of the scene.  Most episodes have music omissions, while others do not simply because they never used music in the first place.

However, the omission of music is not the only flaw there is with the DVD set.  There are audio transfer problems as well, and these occur with the episodes ""Hurricane"" and ""Justice.""  The audio sounds like the equivalent of playing a record at a slightly slower speed, thereby making the entire audio sound deeper and off-pitch.  This same problem has occurred on the Season 2 set with the episode ""Jimmy,"" and on the Season 3 set with the episode ""Last Dance Before An Execution.""  Another reviewer pointed out that the saga cell (opening sequence) for ""The Leap Back"" was incorrect for the episode, but that is how the episode originally aired and is not a mistake by Universal. The reason for that was to preserve the secrets of the season premiere.

Next, bonus features.  As has already been stated, there are two: ""The Great '80s TV Flashback"" and an epsiode from Season 5, ""Liberation.""  (If you can call that a bonus feature.) No problems with each of these, though; it's just the fact that Universal turned down bonus feature offers from Deborah Pratt for no good reason.

Any positive aspects about the set, you may ask?  Well, the picture quality is decent, but not perfect.  There are the occasional dirt specs once in a while, and some shots appear grainy from time to time.  But to give Universal the benefit of the doubt, it was probably the best they could do with the original film.  Overall, I'd rate it an 8/10. Universal has also removed their logo sequences from the beginning of each episode (which is a good thing as that was always annoying with previous sets).  Episodes are available with a ""Play All"" feature, and come with four chapters each.  The cover art is nice as well, though I'm wondering why they didn't include Dean Stockwell on it this time (he was just as important to the series as Scott Bakula).  And as always, the episodes are original, enjoyable, and well-written, with strong performances by Scott Bakula as Dr. Samuel Beckett and Dean Stockwell as Admiral Albert Calavicci.  Stand-out episodes include: ""The Leap Back,"" ""The Wrong Stuff,"" ""Running For Honor,"" and ""A Leap For Lisa.""

The problem with Universal Studios goes beyond simply removing music.  And I'm aware that it's not just Universal that's placed in the position of having to remove music, as other studios have been forced to do it as well.  The problem with Universal is their lack of care for their shows and lack of explanation to fans.  If they simply communicated more with fans or at least attempted to replace the original music with music that actually fits the scenes (at least find some cover songs for crying out loud!), it would show that at least they're trying their best to make up for it.  And when bonus features are practically being handed to them, they should have just accepted them.  Instead, we continuously get cheap, double-sided, bare bones discs, with audio problems.  Universal needs to take some pointers from Fox or Disney, who put out far superior quality DVD sets. Overall, if you're a die-hard fan, I have to recommend waiting it out and purchasing the Region 2 versions, as well as a region-free DVD player.  To anyone else who watches these episodes for the first time, they'll most likely never know the difference, but it would be a shame to never experience the episodes as they were originally intended to be.

It's a real shame that such a fantastic original series does not get the respect it deserves on DVD.",1143849600,16,4132,4.762640449438202
2470351,4,B000CQM4YM,"The best of times--Another leap forward for the series as we got a number of memorable episodes that played with the format of the show. Among the highlights of this season--In ""The Leap Back"" Sam and Al switch places when lightning hits just as Sam is about to make his leap.  ""Raped"" is a memorable episode where Sam is thrown into the body of a woman who has been raped. No one wants to believe ""her"" because the person accused is the son of a prominent member of the community. In ""Temptation Eyes"" a serial murderer is at work and Sam becomes a TV reporter that must prevent the psychic helping the police from becoming the next victim. Sadly ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" is missing (if I'm correctly remembering it being int he episode).""It's a Wonderful Leap"" has Sam as a New York cab driver trying to earn his medallion. He runs over a lady who claims to be an angel there to help Sam achieve his mission which makes it tough for Al because the two don't get along. ""A Leap for Lisa"" is a terrific episode in which Sam leaps into Al as a navy pilot facing rape and murder charges. Sam changes history by asking a key witness not to testify on his behalf and it becomes clear that Al may be put on trial.

The transfer looks pretty good. The images are occasionally soft and there's dirt and debris in some of the transfers (some more than others)but on the whole acceptable. Audio is solid throughout the set. Image quality varies depending upon the amount of optical effects as well and those scenes tend to be on the softer side with more debris and dirt noticeable.

It was the worst of times--There are songs that have been replaced in this set (it is at least noted on the box) but not in all the episodes. For those where the music issue looms large I'd wait for the Region 2 discs in the UK. It's sad that such a unique and terrific show should be the victim of greed (whether it is on Universal's end, the music publisher's end or both)or a lack of interest in securing the rights to important songs. Personally, I would think that the publishers would want additional exposure for their music (it can continue to lead to additional sales and with the music industry in a slump I would have thought they would see that as an important extra).

We get two extras. One is a preview of the season five episode ""Liberation"" where Sam leaps into the body of a mother who must prevent her daughter from being killed at a protest. The second is a featurette that was produced for Universal's 80's TV shows. It's pretty generic but does have some interesting comments from both newspaper and TV writers. None of the extras co-producer/writer Deborah Pratt had offered Universal are included. I'm not sure what Universal's issue is with this but it would be nice if Universal actually showed that they cared what the fans felt (although that's been pretty clear with every set after the first season). This generic focuses on ""Quantum Leap"" for about 5 or 6 minutes of its nearly 20 minute running time. I would gladly forgo expensive extras if Universal would secure the rights to music to key episodes (and let the original producers decide what is key to the scenes in the episodes).

Packaging is like the 3rd season with the individual slimline holders for each episode and the show is, once again, presented on dual sided DVD18 discs. Five stars for the show minus a star for the poor extras and the changes in music.",1143590400,46,3432,4.4848
2470352,4,B000CQM4YM,"Just thought I would weigh in on the music controversy.  I don't have a particularly strong positive or negative feeling about it, but wanted to add some logic to the equation.  I can't help it; I'm an engineer.

I, too, felt that the stories seemed a little flat and did not know why until I started reading about the missing music in these reviews.  One of the complaints stood out because of the glaring mathematical error.

One of the reviewers said he heard that the music companies wanted $10,000 a song.  The reviewer stated that if they sold as few as 10,000 DVDs, they'd only have to charge an extra dollar each - a price nearly every fan would be willing to pay.  The error is that that assumes there is only ONE SONG per season worth buying.  These aren't single episode DVDs, but DVD sets - a complete season.  What if (as is more likely) it is a song (or two) per episode?  That changes the final cost significantly.

Even so, it would come down to how many copies of the season sets they could sell.  If the price went up by $5, it would make a bigger difference in how many people would be willing to buy them.  On the other hand, if they are selling a quarter million sets for each season, then the reviewer's extra dollar per DVD is back in play and that little amount should not have been an issue.

My other take on this situation is that we are griping to the wrong people.  I think we ought to complain to the music companies for being so greedy and stupid.  It's counter-productive anyway.  They should let the music go for a song.  (Sorry, I couldn't help that one.)  When people hear this great music, they are tempted to buy more CDs.  The music companies are missing a huge advertising opportunity.  D'oh!!!

I'm buying the DVD sets anyway.  The stories are still great!",1143504000,27,1796,4.39209726443769

Unfortuntly all the people buying the series are being defrauded by Universal and indirectly by Amazon.com.

The title on the series boxes, and in the legal description at Amazon.com has the word """"the complete"" in the title and elsewhere in the description of the show.

That is Fraud by both Universal & Amazon.com in the marketing & selling of this product.

Even thought the episodes are all there, the songs are not.

they are edited out. AND PEOPLE STILL KEEP BUYING THEM LIKE IDIOTS.

I don't know what most people thimk, but products that are considered ""knockoffs, copies, or seconds,"" are usually cheaper and inferior because they are not the original product.

Selling them and advertising them as the original product is illegal on this planet.

10 to 20 minutes of this product is missing(the original music as filmed by the director and producer).

It is replaced, that is editing the original product.

I could go on, but by now most people should get my drift.

PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT.

Go to amazon.com/uk and buy the region 2 dvds that are being released by a different distributor in England. They are complete, with all the original music, and amazon.com/us does sell cheap region 2 dvd players.

I held off on buying the first DVD set after reading the reviews on it, but...alas...curiousity got the better of me and I had to see (hear) the changes for myself.

2470359,2,B000CQM4YM,"Even by QL season 4, some people still considered television a form of art than mindless commodity to dumb down the masses with.  Hence TV shows would utilize pop music (aka those pop shows from the 80s that included rock music during 3 minute empty driving-around scenes) and it was novel and rather cool at the time, I must admit...

QL did the same thing as needed, also because QL took place in America's past and the music was relevant to the story - not because it was a novel gimmick.

I've yet to buy ANY of the QL releases because, quite frankly, such filleting of these episodes out of ""marketable necessity"" makes them, quite frankly, ""not economically viable"" for me AS A CUSTOMER.

The day this series comes out proper is the day I will buy them.  Not a day before.

Indeed.  I know that the base price for a song can be rather high.  Other TV shows that do have the original music have the creators, in commentary, saying how much they've spent (if nothing more to aggrevate the suits, LOL).  The average cost seems $10,000 for one song.  How many people buy these DVD sets?  If ONLY 10,000 people bought them, then you'd only have to raise the price of each set by a one whopping dollar!  OMG!  What a fortune!  Is that too much extra money to ask a consumer to pay?  A consumer in an obviously niche market that obvious appreciates unfettered episodes because the show itself doesn't catter to the mindless masses?  (Obviously, it seems...  doesn't speak much about ""customer care"", but then DVD companies have no qualms squeezing 10 episodes of a series into a space meant for 7 + a few short extras, or 8 with NO extras...)

And it's a terrible shame because QL seasons 3 and 4 have got the best-ever episodes.

But as for the best episodes in season 4, The Leap Back, It's a Wonderful Leap, The Curse of Ptah-Hotep, and A Leap for Lisa. In addition, A Leap for Lisa is also one of the best episodes, period",1136937600,9,600,4.208695652173913
2470364,2,B000CQM4YM,".... they took out the heart and soul of the show when they dubbed over the music that was in the episodes when they aired.  MIA just isn't the same without ""Georgia on My Mind"" and I can't imagine that any of the 4th season episodes will be any better with their music removed as well.  Canned music just doesn't work and I will not be buying the DVDs.  Thank goodness I taped the shows when they aired.  I will be transferring those to DVD and I'll at least be able to watch the shows the way the creative team meant for them to be watched and not this dreck that Universal is releasing now.

I higly recommend the show but cannot recommend the DVDs.",1136678400,11,652,4.184
2470365,4,B000CQM4YM,"I would have given it 5 stars because I love this show and am excited Universal finally decided to release it, but I am disappointed that they are not including more special features or blooper reels, as great as the chemistry was between Scott and Dean, the bloopers had to be hilarious, such a shame that we are missing so much behind the scenes on this show! I am also disappointed that Universal doesn't seem to be interested in any reunion/wrap up movies.  I will still buy all the seasons, because I loved the show, and miss it.

2470366,5,B000CQM4YM,"Quantum Leap is a great series but I am very disappointed how the American companies lack respect for us interinational fans of the series. Usually having to wait another year or so after the US to get our hands on the boxset.

Come on American companies give us the interinational fans the DVDs first for a change. :(",1135900800,4,318,4.482758620689655
2470367,5,B000CQM4YM,I've been waiting a long time for Sam to return to DVD. Here we continue on the journey of Sam and Al more fantastic adventures in time. A remark was made as to season 3's copy of Die hard music well if that being the case its great that they waited. Now I think I have to make a comment about the other seasons as compared to Season 4. Does anyone notice how they pieced together the previous seasons to where at the end of some of the episodes they do not correspond to the next episode on the disc? I mean what the heck is that? Now I'm not complaining about this either but in Season 2 the face cover as they see some of the episodes that are supposed to be in that disc set are actually upcomming seasons such as Season 4 where Al and Sam trade places in leaps at the end of Season 3's Shock Theatre. Okay now that I have given my two cents on that. I want to fully reccomend to you fans out there to get this season its what a lot of us have been waiting for. Here's to they get Season 5 out soon as possible.,1135728000,7,1015,3.9320388349514563
2470368,5,B000CQM4YM,"This scifi series as a whole is one of my favorite ones as a kid. This specific set will continue on the adventures of Dr Beckett as he journeys to discover if there is any purpose to his leaping. The first episode of the series will be exciting as Sam switches places with Al in the 40's and discovers that Al is now doing the leaping and the leaping is not bound by a certain mathematical factor. The leaping is simply a process of leaping within the frame of one's lifetime as Al is older than Sam the leap can be before Sam was born and into Al's own  lifetime. This raises the question of what is the true nature of leaping anyway and will Sam choose to leave his friend stuck leaping or will he want to change places with his best friend again.

Its a story of morals, a story about leaping through time into one's place to change something that once went wrong into wright, and an inspirational series as well. Sam meets each time he leaps a different person that is famous. Once he met Stallone/Rocky and told him about boxing with meat in the meat freezer, he meets Elvis(or rather is Elvis) and the list goes on.

Watch the shows on a Saturday night, kick back, relax and enjoy leaping.",1135468800,4,1196,4.306666666666667
2470369,4,B000CQM4YM,"As you may know, there were QUITE a few complaints from diehard fans about the music replacements made on Season 2, which prompted new labelling of Season 3 about possible changes made to the original soundtrack. The reason that was given by Universal, I believe, for the music changes was so that they could release Season 2 as quickly as possible. Whether that is true or not, if it was indeed the case then we should be grateful for the length of time they took to release this 4th season dvd set. Maybe, just MAYBE, we'll get a truly ""complete"" season. I would hate for the fantastic songs from ""Temptation Eyes"", for example, to have been replaced with some random and meaningless instrumental pieces.

*** A lot of people have mentioned the music contained in the US version of these DVDs. They are right when they say the music in the UK version is unedited. I never noticed this until I bought the UK version of Season 2. The last episode - M.I.A. comes complete with the uncut ""Georgia On My Mind"". My point is, that if you can wait for the UK DVDs to be released, then do so - They are much more authentic and well worth the wait for die-hard fans.",1134518400,74,1003,4.2356020942408374
