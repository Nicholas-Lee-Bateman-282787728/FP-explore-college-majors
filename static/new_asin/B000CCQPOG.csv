8588269,5,B000CCQPOG,"Milton weaves a beautiful tapestry of folklore, music, dance, and color in this excellent DVD.  He puts on a great show, highlighted by creative staging (Aleijadinho meets Chico Rei with Milton at the apex), acrobats, and the uplifting drums of Minas.  Milton gives tribute to past partners (Marcio Borges, Lo  Borges, and Fernando Brant) and also incorporates the compositions of other famous Brazilian composers (Joao Bosco/Aldir Blanc, Tavinho Moura), opening and closing with the recorded voice of Elis Regina, which sent shivers up my spine.

Milton expertly plays the guitar and accordion as well as employs his haunting voice to great effect  - those echo-like sounds he makes with his voice are unsurpassed.  His band is also top-notch and includes one of my favorite keyboard players, Kiko Continentino.

I highly recommend this DVD.  Viva Milton!",1491264000,,856,5.288888888888889
