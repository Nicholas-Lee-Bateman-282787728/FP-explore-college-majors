3099471,1,B0012XIGWS,"I bought this video thinking it was a Spanish language edition of the great PBS kids cartoons. It is NOT! It is the scholastic series - there are 7 stories (only 1 is curious george). The one about Curious George isn't animated; it shows pictures from the book. My son was expecting the cute animated George and this video doesn't keep his attention. Scholatic does great videos - but this one isn't. Hope this review helps so you can not make the same mistake I did!!

Este video no es lo mismo que el Jorge Curious de PBS. Este video contiene 7 cuentos, pero solo uno es de Jorge. El cuento de Jorge no es animado - muestren unos fotos del libro solamente. Fue una desilusion y a mi hijo no le gusta. Espero que esto le ayude a no comprar este producto sin saber lo que deberas vas a recibir.",1217980800,29,794,4.258278145695364

8248100,1,B0012XIGWS,"I agree with the previous comment. Horrible video.  Creepy narrator voice, reading poorly pixelated storybook images. Waste of money. Title deceiving.... Should be 'Curious George.....and OTHER stories.***",1424131200,,205,6.592592592592593
8248101,1,B0012XIGWS,muy malo .son imgenes y una persona relatando el cuento no es lo que yo quera .,1420416000,,79,3.7058823529411766
8248102,5,B0012XIGWS,I was worried the Spanish language version of these stories might not be as good as the originals but thankfully I was wrong!  The voices are very fitting to the characters and the translations are good.  I originally ordered this because my two year old loves Curious George but I am not a fan of the PBS series.  My son ended up liking all the other stories on the DVD better than the George story which was a nice surprise and introduced us to some new authors.,1393459200,,464,4.310344827586207
8248103,4,B0012XIGWS,"The spanish translation did not match what the English wording was in some cases. Otherwise, it is a good book for practicing and learning spanish..",1373155200,,148,4.96
8248104,5,B0012XIGWS,OMG!! I loved this video so much. It was well narrated. It was a gift for a little boy in Cuba and he is going to love it!!,1363996800,,123,3.4285714285714284
8248105,5,B0012XIGWS,"This is not animated, but it is like having someone read to your kids, which is probably even better.  My kids are bilingual and they LOVE these stories.",1324252800,5,153,4.464285714285714
8248106,4,B0012XIGWS,"This three DVD read-along set contains 18 cute illustrated, award-winning stories which are narrated in Spanish and English.

Children will have fun listening to the stories being narrated to them and, depending on their age, also be able to flip between the Spanish and English read-along subtitles.

The stories are geared towards kids five to nine years old, but older children will enjoy learning Spanish too.

We quite enjoyed the collection. My favorite story would have to be Curious George Rides a Bike.",1316304000,2,511,5.132530120481928
8248107,2,B0012XIGWS,This dvd isn't true dvd. It's illustrations with a voice talking in background. So kind of wierd. If I had known I wouldn't have bought it. But my son still likes to watch it from time to time. He's 3 1/2.,1289865600,2,205,4.024390243902439
