2349178,4,B000A1IMI6,"An homage to the American Civil War short stories of Ambrose Bierce who was a big deal back in the day though today I doubt most people know of him. Three short stories of his are brought to life: ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek"", ""One Kind of Officer"" and ""The Story of Conscience"". The filming was clearly done on a budget and the filmmakers paid so much homage to the stories that as a film it moves slow on and off at times. That's a no no in films. As a fan of Bierce I'm willing to overlook that problem. An equally good version of ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek"" was done by the ""Twilight Zone"". Campbell Scott stars as Ambrose Bierce in the early introduction of this piece as he spars with famous novelist Gertrude Atherton (telling her that novels are just padded short stories) while a young Randolph Hearst listens on and later employs Bierce after hearing the three tales soon to be delivered.

Bierce, a haunted veteran of the American Civil War, was said to have visited some of his old battlefields in old age and then crossed the border into Mexico and was never seen again. The DVD leaves out that Bierce was also doing research on the recent Mexican Revolution and associating with rebels so that may have had something to do with his disappearance as well. I would recommend this film to American Civil War buffs and/or fans of Bierce but not so much to other viewers as it has a slow pacing that modern moviegoers will find unsettling.

2349181,5,B000A1IMI6,"I don't believe that any war in which we have ever been involved was as needless and tragic is the War Between the States.  This trilogy involves two short stories written by Ambrose Bierce, a Union officer who seems to have lived a tortured, troubled life as a result of his combat experiences.  The third short story relates to incidents that probably happened all the way from Manassas to Memphis during the War.  I will not provide spoilers on these three shorts, but anyone who enjoys the study of history, and the twisted, illogical, immoral conduct in which people engage during war, will find this trilogy interesting, to say the least.",1212969600,8,644,4.783783783783784
2349182,4,B000A1IMI6,"bierce's works are amazing and merit further attention by hollywood.  the scenes played like episodes of the twilight zone - appropriately.  contrary to the opinions of the other viewers, i was never pulled into or found believable the characters sipping tea / bourbon / iced tea as bierce succumbed to reading three of his stories.  in the first, i found myself antsy, waiting for something to happen, anticipation building, until, once action began, i, quite viscerally, didn't want it to be happening.  here, i was drawn in.  likewise in his second and third stories, i was fully pulled in.  i found that this was somewhat disappointing, overall.  i would purchase it used or view library collections.",1207094400,,704,5.017241379310345
2349183,4,B000A1IMI6,"You might wonder where writer/directors such as Ray Bradbury or M.Night Shyamalan got their interesting stories and noted end twists. You can basically stop at the 19th century short story genius Ambrose Bierce. Bierce was a world renowned contributor to The San Francisco Examiner owned by mogul William Randolph Hearst, and his 1891 meeting with famous-to-be novelist Gertrude Atherton is the basis for the retelling of three of Bierce's famous ""Civil War Stories"" that were stinging observations on the actions of mankind under war conditions. Bierce's writings bothered and infuriated most because his observations deglamorized and deglorified war and showed the soldier and the civilian as they in truth Bierce recorded them under such conditions.

Campbell Scott portrays Bierce as he is challenged and cajoled by Atherton and Hearst into a ""woman's parlour reading"" of three of his short stories ""One Kind of Officer"",""Story of a Conscience"" and ""The Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" which has been made famous several times over on two continents. The retelling of these stories,shown as short films, give a great sense of the cynical and ironic that shows in Bierce's writings. This DVD is almost a curiosity if anything. It is not terribly overwhelming in it's production value as much as it is in the 78 minute content of the three stories. It is easy to see how Bierce's stories became foundational for so many to come. Informationally, this is a must for writers and literary people who note the differences between the genre of the short vs. the novel as well as the need for an author to have control over the content of their works.",1198713600,2,1647,5.032967032967033
2349184,4,B000A1IMI6,"It seems appropriate and not at all accidental that Civil War Stories should be released at a time when the realities of our current war have come home to so many of us.  Ambrose Bierce's vision of futility and emptiness within a universe deprived of divine order is unequivocally realized in this short, but finely crafted film.  There is a subtle, yet deliberate, telling of three, separate stories that focuses on dialogue and expression as a means to convey the thoughts and inner conflicts of the various characters, without resorting to extravagant dramatic effects.  The first of these, filmed entirely in fog, evolves like a dream bathed in blue-gray light.  The second, most economical of the three, puts the actors to the test as their faces communicate stunning realizations within the sparse dialogue.  The third, probably best known of the stories, is filled with action that has been prudently edited to keep a frantic pace while preserving the intensity of the final denouement.

The director has set Bierce, W. R. Hearst, and Gertrude Atherton in conversation in a hotel drawing room as a device for unifying the three stories and has written mordant lines for Bierce, which Campbell Scott delivers with soulful strength.",1180656000,3,1237,5.068965517241379
2349185,4,B000A1IMI6,"This movie starts out like a high school play. I was put off by what seem obvious wigs on the actors, especially on Campbell Scott, who plays Bierce. And I was put off by everyone's stilted, stagy delivery.

But before long, the amateurishness lifted, like a curtain rising - and I found myself being absorbed in the recreations of Bierce's opinionated pessimisms, and in the dramatizations of several of his short stories. So stick with it.

The story dramatizations take their time. These vignettes aren't for people who demand action and special effects. The first story for example will make you wander in a dense fog on a long-gone Civil War battlefield for long minutes at a time, without anything really happening. But it was this very deliberateness that won me over, that put me in these characters' shoes as they try to decide where their priorities lie - in the abstractions of patriotism and honor - or in their personal relationships with people who have meant something to them. This is so often a slow, foggy, inward process of decision that the pace of the film serves the material well.

Bierce's most famous short story, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" is well-done here. I don't think it's done quite as well as it was done decades ago as a Twilight Zone episode. But it is still mesmerizing, heart-wrenching.

I had known Ambrose Bierce mostly for his ""Devil's Dictionary,"" his collection of epigrammatic, cynical definitions - and for his mysterious disappearance in Mexico almost 100 years ago. I hadn't realized he had written regular columns for William Randolph Hearst's papers, or that he had written so many moving short stories. So this movie was an eye-opener for me. It sent me back to check Bierce's collections of stories off the library shelves. Like me, you might end up being grateful to this movie for allowing you to discover, or to re-discover, an American original, an American genius.",1173398400,35,1929,4.871951219512195
2349186,2,B000A1IMI6,"This one is to draw a different audience not a civil war report or product.

If it was one of Stephen king film without the civil war background I would have rated differently.",1167955200,,176,4.333333333333333
2349187,4,B000A1IMI6,"When I rented the DVD I did not know what to expect.  The subject matter interested me, and on viewing the movie I was delighted.  I had seen one of the three, Occurrance at Owl Creek Bridge, in adapted form on the Twilight Zone or some other series.  The other two stories are in hindsight true to the original short stories, which I have since read.

The stories within a story treatment was novel but allows the viewer to get to know the author a bit and his motivation.  The ending where Bierce agrees to continue his employment with Hearst on his terms, is ironic due to his firm anti-war stance and Hearst's future role in plunging the US into the folly of the Spanish American War.  I wonder if a crisis of conscience over his role in formenting that fiasco, did not lead Beirce to revolutionary Mexico and his subsequent disappearance.",1165881600,4,843,4.5131578947368425
2349188,5,B000A1IMI6,"First of all, if you're a Bierce fan, you won't tolerate a lame Hollywood version of the man. You won't be disappointed; Campbell Scott does a great job: He's obtuse and cynical--everything we expect from Bierce.

The three stories are beautifully filmed and acted. In the first segment, ""One Kind of Officer,"" the battle scenes go on too long, but the story's payoff makes up for it. The second segment, ""Story of a Conscience,"" is perfectly realized--the best of the three, in my opinon. The third, ""Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge"" is, of course, the most famous story. It's well done, and it includes story details that were missing from the award-winning 1962 Enrico film. Nevertheless, it doesn't have the emotional impact that the Enrico film had. Enrico nailed the climactic moment so well, I don't think anyone could ever do it better.

I hope this film, even though it obviously had limited distribution, will inspire uninformed viewers to get into Bierce. He was such an outrageous character (no less than eight biographies have been written) that his life often overshadows his work--but that's part of the fun.

These filmed versions of Bierce's stories really stay true to his intention: to show what an utterly foolish and misguided creature is man, with war being the greatest evidence of his folly.

Plus, it's great to see Bierce hanging out with his employer / nemesis, William Randolph Hearst. Great stuff!",1164499200,29,1424,4.970588235294118

2349195,5,B000A1IMI6,"Having been a big fan of Ambrose Bierce stories since the fabulous French version of ""Owl Creek Bridge"" I can't tell you how pleasantly surprised I was to attend the preview of Ambrose Bierce: Civil War Stories.  It not only contains a great new rendition of ""Owl Creek"" but two of my other favorite stories captured on film.  Campbell Scott completely and totally embodies everything I have ever studied about Bierce.  Vivian Schilling and Nathan Darrow do an excellent job as Atherton and Hearst defining the period and style of post Civil War America.  All in all this was a great evening combining three fabulous stories wrapped together by a dialogue between Bierce, Atherton and Hearst.  This is a must see for anyone, anywhere interested in a troubled time in the United States because it clarifies Bierce's position on the War and his job with Hearst.  With great acting, superb battle scenes and outstanding cinematography a great buy for Civil War historians, schools, libraries and all fans of great filmmaking.",1158278400,13,1022,4.982352941176471
2349196,5,B000A1IMI6,"I became a fan of the writings of Ambrose Bierce when I first saw a version of his ""Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge"" used as an episode of the original ""TWILIGHT ZONE.""  Needless to say, I was waiting with great anticipation for the completion of this first-ever collection of Bierce's three most famous tales of the Civil War... all featuring his insights and surprise endings.  Campbell Scott is brilliant as the ""bitter Bierce"" whose understandings of the politics of war seem to greatly surpass the intellectual capabilities of his contemporary goverment leaders.  Vivian Schilling delivers a predictably strong turn as the saucy novelist Gertrude Atherton, and she makes a fine counterpoint to the banter between Bierce and his publisher, William Randolf Hearst (played by newcomer Nathan Darrow) during the set-up for three knock-em-dead Bierce tales.  ""Story of A Conscience"", ""One Kind Of Officer"" and an all-new remake of ""An Occurence At Owl Creek Bridge"" make this collection of CIVIL WAR STORIES a must see for general audiences, and a must buy for collectors, schools, libraries and fans of great drama, great acting and superb battle action.",1157414400,5,1153,5.182795698924731

8072045,5,B000A1IMI6,"There have been some excellent films made over the years dealing with the American Civil War. ""Glory"", ""Gettysburg"", ""Gods and Generals"" are some of the more recent films that come to my mind. There is one little movie that also comes to mind that I would rate as an excellent one based on the short stories of American writer Ambrose Bierce titled ""Ambrose Bierce: Civil War Stories"". Not a big production film like the ones I had previously mentioned but still entertaining and captivating of the viewers attention.

For those not familiar with him Ambrose Bierce (1842 - 1914) was a writer most noted for his short stories. Most noted for horror stories and stories of the civil war he became one of the most well known and noted writiers of the 19th century. He was a first lieutenant during the Civil War in the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment. Some of the battles he fought at were Shiloh and Kennesaw Mountain. It was what he witnessed during his time fighting in the war that would inspire him to write the kind of stories he would become famous for.

Three of Bierce's more well known stories of the Civil War are on this DVD. They are ""One Kind Of Officer"", ""Story Of A Conscience"" and probably his most well known story of the war ""An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge."" The first story tells of an Officer who is given an order from his superior to fire on any advancing troops. The Officer will follow that order to the ""T"". It is very foggy which leads an aura of creepiness as they wait for any movement to come out of that fog. That movement finally comes and as ordered they open fire. Turns out they are firing on their own troops. What happens next I will not reveal to avoid spoiler alerts. ""Story Of A Conscience"" tells the story of a Union Officer who captures a Confederate spy only to recall how that man had once saved his life. What happens? Again no spoiler alerts here.

The last story  ""An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge"" is the most well known story from Bierce as already mentioned. Do know while it is the same story this is not the famous version that was made back in 1962 and won an Academy Award for best short film and would later appear during the final season of ""Twilight Zone"". This version is a little more complete then the 1962 version in that it explains what events had happened that lead to the main character standing up on the Owl Creek bridge with a noose around his neck. Also while there was no dialog in the original version there is in this version which again helps to explain what had happened up to that point. This is the high point of the three stories and what makes watching movie worthwhile although I will admit I kind of like the 1962 version a little better. Do check out the special features to this movie. There is a pretty good documentary on the making of the film but there is also an expanded version of the ""Owl Creek"" segment seen here that gives even a little more detail to the story.

In between the stories and during the opening and closing of the film there is a sub-story where Ambrose Bierce, played by Campbell Scott, meets with William Randolf Hearst, played by Nathan Darrow, and an up and coming writer Gertrude Atherton played by Vivian Schilling. Hearst wants Bierce to come back to his newspaper to write while Atherton is looking for advice in her career. To see these three at the start of the movie might make you think this film will not be good. The set looks fake as well as the make up and costumes but look past that because the acting on everyone's part is what makes this so good to watch. The scenes with these three does slow the pace a little for the movie but they do help to set up the stories that will be told. This was not a high budget film and it shows but you know there have been countless movies made over the decades that had enormous budgets and they were awful. Big budgets don't mean a thing if you don't have a good story to go with it. ""Ambrose Bierce: Civil War Stories"" had a small budget but has a good story to go with it. Three in fact. It doesn't matter if you are not a history or Civil War buff. This is a good movie to watch.",1431561600,3,4146,4.351421188630491
