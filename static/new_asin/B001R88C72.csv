3773938,4,B001R88C72,"Nothing like having a $200 million exposure (this made 6 films ago from Twilight for Stewart) and an Oscar nomination (M. Leo) to highlight an unknown film. To be clear, Melissa has two minutes of non-dialogue screen time in a flashback montage and Kirsten has intermittent segments in the first 35 minutes of this 80 minute film. Bruce Dern and others have equivalent lines in this film throughout so I would consider this an ensemble piece, especially once the ending plays out.

Several stories parlay into this segment of NorEast lifestyles entailing two families' rural existence complicated by past and present loves tying said families together. The performances are nuanced and let loose an idea of what small-town romances can be like over two related generations. In plot summary, do not expect much in opening and closing; the opening discussion is about cereal and the closing discusses what to make for dinner. The middle tried to fit in three love stories with the remaining 60 minutes. The writing is inconsistent throughout, bolstered several times by moments of people needing to react differently than they should have.

The DVD quality is adequate, the supplements list a commentary, exclusive behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes and a 5.1 sound. To be honest - the supplements are completely forgettable and the film's 5.1 only gets used a handful of times. The cast interviews total three minutes of how phenomenal Kristen Stewart is (not kidding), the ""exclusives"" are an additional three minutes of film making and the deleted scenes were irrelevant.

The fan base of this film is fanatical, so expect lots of slams unless one reviews this film as the best thing since Don't Come Knocking on the minimalist front. But to be real, this is the story about a neurological/muscular disorder challenged teen losing her virginity, nothing more or less. Solid performances and decent music lend this a few stars above normal, that and a plethora of new Twilight fans giving this a much higher rating then other films similar in nature. A 4-star prop on Stewart alone providing an out-of-the-ordinary showing (filmed almost three years ago).",1237766400,23,2154,5.113636363636363

Best part was when he finally admits his weaknesses to his love interest and rekindles a relationship with his sons.  Nice, quirky film.",1509840000,,373,5.166666666666667

3773945,4,B001R88C72,"This is an emotional story about human love in a rural American setting. As such it will probably bring tears to your eyes. I know it did to mine. The script by Jayce Bartok and the direction by Mary Stuart Masterson are carefully composed to create a celebration of love that defies convention.

BEWARE SPOILERS

Georgia (Kristen Stewart) is a 15-year-old girl suffering from Friedreich's ataxia. When her to-be lover, cafeteria worker Beagle (Aaron Stanford), asks if she is going to get better, Georgia says, No, this is pretty much as good as it's gonna get until my heart gives out. She has invited him into her bedroom to help her with her homework. At one point she says, You can kiss me if you want to. Stewart plays the part with limbs all askew and dangling almost helplessly. Yet her face is so, so pretty and healthy looking that the contrast is striking. The next day they go to a motel. She is determined to experience love before she dies. The idea is so touching.

Also sure to pull your heart strings is the older and mostly secret love affair between Easy Kimbrough (Bruce Dern) and Marg Kaminski (Elizabeth Ashley). Bittersweet is Guy Kimbroughs (Jayce Bartok) realization that his girlfriend Stephanie (Miriam Shor) has married and started a family in his absence.

All of this could easily go from pathos to bathos to the maudlin except for the careful direction by Masterson and the fine acting all around.

What I have been trying to figure out is why the movie is entitled The Cake Eaters. What came to mind was Marie Antoinettes infamous, Let them eat cake, but I couldn't see the connection.

3773947,4,B001R88C72,"This was probably one of Kristen's Stewart's better roles, exceeding the crappy Twilight movie trilogy I struggled through watching several years ago. I did not have to struggle through this movie. Her portrayal of the neurologically disabled girl, Georgia, was realistic and convincing. It was almost too  painful to watch the female lead twitch, shamble and lurch her way throughout the story. Although we know from the beginning, that the prognosis is poor, the main character's drive to be like everyone else  overshadows this negativity. Overshadowing,even the awkward relationship she has with the needy wounded boyfriend, Beagle. Is it any wonder that this guy has a dog's name? The other two relationships with the older family members (Beagle's brother and their widowed father) were stilted and lackluster serving nothing to enhance the story.",1497657600,3,853,5.406015037593985

3773949,3,B001R88C72,"I like Stewart so that's why I watched this film.  Was a bit disappointed in some of the script.  Plot was simple, but slow.  Took too long to figure out why the older brother came back to town.  His part was okay, but didn't make much sense overall.  He came back to find the woman he proposed to 3 years ago had a child and was married by looking thru her house windows like a stalker; even tho he had already spoken to her and kissed her at his house.  I liked the Grandmother who at least showed she had life experiences under her belt.  The mother part was scattered.  If my daughter stayed out all night with cafeteria worker the police would have been called.

3773982,5,B001R88C72,"I am NOT a Kristen Stewart fan at all but this film was perfectly lovely. The acting was wonderful and genuine. It was one of a few films she didn't just play herself in different costumes. She did a good job trying to mimic a palsy. The script was the real winner.  The obvious end to have her drift off to heaven after fulfilling her bucket list must have been tempting, but the writers tried to be real. I love that they had her mainstreamed into the high school. The wheelchair issue was a subtle reference to what really happens in our schools, administration usually tries to insist on making the slow or awkward child dependent on a wheelchair thus disabling the child more, simply because they think she might bump into someone in the hall. I liked that that issue, so real and on point. The mother was a piece of work cashing in on her child's suffering. Really?

3774029,4,B001R88C72,"A little quirky, but a cute little story. Probably the only role Kristen Stewart played really well. It wasn't cringe-worthy at all, and was actually a good performance by her. The rest of the reviews will tell you what the plot is about, but with no expectations prior to watching this, I actually did enjoy it. On the surface, it is mostly a light-hearted drama/romance, with undertones of a deeper plot, which the movie only touches on here and there. Under the surface, it asks a question that people with similar conditions probably ask themselves: Will I find love before it's too late?. It was a good plot, with a good mix of characters, and a believable premise and setting. It ended with a few un-answered questions, but for the main characters, it is pretty clear what happens at the end. If you are familiar with the movie ""The Other Sister"", it plays out very similar to it, but not as extreme, and in the vein of a more Independent movie. Overall, it was good movie, and an unexpected surprise. Also.....still a better love story than Twilight.",1464048000,,1057,4.657754010695188

Same thing for when she was performing vampire and performing Red Ridinghood and every single thing she has ever done with the exception of American Ultra--probably the best thing she has ever done, which isn't saying much. Why does this beautiful young lady think she is an actress? I guess for the same reasons that Stephanie Meyer thinks she's a writer. KS picks the wrong projects, the wrong men...meh what a mess...and people tell her she's a serious actress. Take the money and run, little girl. This will not last for you.

3774110,1,B001R88C72,"I cannot recommend this movie.

I don't understand the title of this movie.  No one in the entire movie ever ate any cake.  We never even saw any cake.

The title does not make sense, and the Amazon description is false.

Kristen Stewart looked beautiful with long hair (of course, a wig), and when her character of Georgia cut her hair super-short, it looked terrible.

This movie was boring and slow.  The movie was all over the place.  There was the main plot, about Georgia.  There were a few very small sub-plots.  This didn't even feel like even a TV movie, it felt like a play-on-film.  The ending was abrupt, leaving the feeling of, ""That's all?  That's the end?""

S P O I L E R S

The Amazon description is not correct - - this is absolutely not a story of first love, or falling in love, or a ""celebration"" of love.  It is a story of an ill and disabled 15 year old who wants to lose her virginity because she is afraid that she will die before she gets the chance.  She throws herself at the first ""boy"" - - a 20-something loser named Beagle - - who looks at her.  She asks him to come to her house within a few minutes of meeting him, and he actually asks why.  She asks him up to her bedroom to ""study"" and within a few minutes, she grabs him and kisses him, and they make out on her bed until her mother yells from downstairs that it is getting late.  She makes a plan with him for a ""date"" the next day.  He picks her up for their ""date"" on his motorcycle, and when he asks her where they are going, she tells him to take her to a motel.  They check into the motel, and she immediately starts undressing and tells him to take a shower. She comments on how he obviously never works out, and it is clear that she is disappointed with his looks and is not attracted to him.  He asks her if, instead of sex, they can just watch TV and talk, and she says no and says that she will just leave the motel if he won't have sex with her.  So, he walks out, leaving her alone in the motel, and then he shortly returns, and they just have sex.  They fall asleep.  They wake up in the morning, and they get on his motorcycle, and he takes her to school.  There is no goodbye kiss.  Would anyone call this love?????

There is a sub-plot about Georgia's grandmother and Beagle's father (whose wife recently died), who have been having a secret affair for many years, and he asks her to marry him (without any ring), and she never answers.

There is a sub-plot about Beagle's brother, who is a failing musician, who has been gone and out-of-touch from everyone for three years, and shows up out of nowhere to find out that his mother has died and he didn't even know.  He goes to see his girlfriend whom he has had no contact with for those three years, whom he had proposed to just before he left town and then left her without even saying goodbye, and she is shown with a little girl whom we can assume is his child which he never knew about.

There are sub-plots about the butcher business where a cow is slaughtered, and Georgia's mother's art business.

My reviews usually don't summarize a movie, but there is nothing else to say because nothing else happens and there is nothing else to talk about.  The actors did a very good job with what they had to work with.  I did not see any comedy here there was some drama, but nothing to tear up over... and a lot of unhappy characters without hope who seemed to be just surviving rather than living their lives.",1454198400,2,3462,4.211246200607903

3774234,5,B001R88C72,"First and foremost, the casting works and I mean really works. Bruce Dern as the grandfather pulls off the part with the gentle approach of the consummate professional. Somehow he holds together the family despite his flaws. Kristen Stewart manages to pull off a convincing Georgia so fragile yet refusing to stay within boundaries her family would set. Aaron Stanford plays the love interest looking to be both shy and uncertain yet again in the plot refuses to play a sunshine role as he was the primary caretaker of his dying mother.

Mary Stuart Masterson  really needs to do more movies as she handles a bittersweet plot with aplomb. Set in upstate NY the background of just getting by resonates without anyone referring to it. Scenes linger exactly long enough to set the mood and no more. The plot remains as it should be, character driven.

The writing stands out giving the actors all that they need to work with. No one over acts and here both Stewart and Dern really excel. Nor does the plot sugarcoat anything. Georgia knows she is going to die and is determined to explore love while she can. She encourages and confronts Beagle until she achieves her goals of having an intimate and ongoing relationship with him. It is a recurring theme in the movie. Easy will not be the loyal spouse, Guy is forced to admit he has hit rock bottom and failed everyone around him. Georgia's mother has to face the fact that Georgia will not be controlled.

There is no such thing as a perfect movie, still Masterson comes very close.",1439856000,,1531,4.659259259259259

3774270,3,B001R88C72,"I didn't really know much about this film before watching it. I figured Id give it a shot because it was recommended to me and because I love Kristen Stewart. I find that sometimes its good to go into a movie blind because you don't have expectations. Youre not waiting for things to happen, you can allow yourself to just get lost in the flow of the movie and in the performances and thats what happened to me here.
Cake Eaters isn't a great film, it might not even be a very good one. Its slow, there isn't a lot of substance to the story and it doesnt have any real kind of style to speak of. However, the beauty of this film lies in the performance of Kristen Stewart. The transformation she makes for this film is simply astonishing. You can go ahead and add Cake Eaters to her already long list of mesmerizing performances in her stellar career. The film loses momentum whenever shes not on screen. I didn't really click or care about any of the other characters or their arc. Bruce Dern gives a good performance, but there isn't much to his character (you can really say that about all the characters) and Jesse L. Martins talents are underutilized here. Most of these characters lack true personality, so it made it difficult to care about what was happening to them.
Good, not great. Good performances, dull characters. There are things to like storyline wise; it just doesnt give you enough. If you're already a Kristen Stewart fan, then you should enjoy this movie (or probably have already seen it). If not, then Im not sure theres much here for you.",1437436800,,1562,4.503521126760563

I never saw the Twilight films, but I did get the idea that fans of the movie were not enamored with her performance. All I can say is that I was so taken by her performance in ""Still Alice"" that I searched out another movie of hers. Her speech, her body movement, her expressions and gestures were all elements of a first rate performance. There are several relationships explored and this was where the script lost focus. Because almost every character was eccentric and colorful, it grew tiresome.

I was watching Snow White and it occurred to me that she has rarely ever worked with an excellent script and I was wondering whether she is so sought out as an actress because she really seems to be able to carry an entire movie without having to say much. I looked up her filmography and noticed that her first real ""breakout"" acting gig was in a movie called Speak, where she didn't. After making this connection, I forced myself to reassess her strength as an actress. Truth be told, I was very impressed with her portrayal of Georgia.  I nearly forgot she was actually Kristen Stewart (and that is actually a really hard thing to do when you chose to watch a movie nearly to specifically critique her as an actress). I heard from aplenty that Kristen Stewart is the most over-rated actresses ever. After watching this movie, I think that she truly might be one of the most under-rated actresses working today. I think she's a director's actress, a distinction she never gets to actually carry because she is Kristen Stewart.",1408924800,,1169,4.674757281553398

One caught my eye because of the unusual title.  I had no idea who Kristen Stewart was then, but the cover photo was alluring.  When I saw that it had been directed and produced by Mary Stuart-Masterson, a favorite of mine, I knew there had to be something special about this film.  Regretfully, I left the store without renting it.  5 years later, I'm perusing the 'free movie' section in Comcast's X-finity channel, and there it is!  By now, I had heard more than enough about Kristen Stewart, the brooding, bratty-looking kid who has taken the world by storm as ""Bella"" and seems to be on every cover of every damn magazine.  Stewart was only 17 when she made this film, and her performance as ""Georgia"", a young girl afflicted with a terrible and fatal neuro-muscular disease, is brilliant.  If you're under 35 and used to being bombarded by the typical action-packed, F/X-laden, non-stop madness that is most movies today, DON'T bother buying or watching this film.",1341187200,2,1172,4.71078431372549

The basic story is fine; the characters are a decently varied assortment of potentially interesting folk; the actors are good enough (although Stewart is the only one who really shines, and even the two old pros, Dern and Ashley, are embarrassing only because of the awful screenplay); and the direction, photography, etc, are competent; but the dialog is awful. Really, really bad.

I suppose it is trying to be deep and meaningful, but it is just painfully stilted and artificial: from beginning to end, not one word any character speaks sounds like a real human being talking. The extremely awkward title is a good example of what the dialog is like. The Cake Eaters had good potential but was torpedoed by very bad writing.",1302998400,,971,4.808383233532934

3774376,4,B001R88C72,"The Cake Eaters definitely feels like a low budget type drama, but it does an okay job telling a story involving three separate love conflicts among a smalltown family. It's basically like an enhanced episode of the hit TV show Parenthood.

The main love story revolves around a 16-year old teenage girl with a terribly fatal muscular disease (this is the most popular of the three), another one involves a middle-aged woman who's an advice-giving hairdresser (hardly receives much attention) and the final one involves a much older couple.

Basically, since the storyline mainly focuses on the young girl with the muscle disease, the plot develops around her as she tries desperately to function as a typical normal teenager.

The entire storyline takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and perhaps the most unusual thing about the movie is how extremely unsettling and quiet the volume is. In the background you practically don't hear *anything* at all.

The acting is decent enough, though I've seen a heck of a lot better in many other films. The biggest problem is the fact the storyline is ridiculously rudimentary, and so it's very easy to grasp the events taking place to the point of being almost mindless. Besides that, it's alright.",1299283200,2,1258,4.919811320754717

3774378,3,B001R88C72,"Georgia (Kristen Stewart) is a 16 year old girl afflicted with Friedreich's Ataxia, a debilitating disease that often attacks first in the motor movements, gait, and speech.  Those hoping this would severely limit Stewart's speaking role might be pleased to learn that her lines are appropriately diminished.  I think of her as a female version of Keanu Reeves, someone who should be seen much more than heard.  Nonetheless, she's disabled but still mentally aware, and she has recently become interested in boys and the idea of sex.

For those who have skimmed reviews and read things about a disabled teen having sex with a beagle, have no fears.  This is not that kind of movie.  It's really Beagle (Aaron Stanford), the nickname for a young man named Dwight Kimbrough who works at Georgia's high school cafeteria and has just suffered the loss of his mother.  The two begin an odd romance, seeking to fulfill her intercourse desire and fill his emotional void.  Along the way she gets an atrociously ugly haircut for which her stylist should have been lynched, septuagenarian relatives potentially allow themselves to be accomplices to statutory rape, a prodigal son returns in a subplot more pointless than a white crayon, and the special ed. Juliet gets whisked away on her white knight's horse.  Except by ""whisked away"" I mean ""strapped to the driver by a bungee chord,"" and by horse I mean ""beat up moped.""  Everything eventually, and awkwardly, comes full circle for Beagle's family as well.  Beagle's father proclaims love to the woman with whom he's been infidelitous while his terminally ill wife dwindled away.  The pointless brother finds resolution at his mother's grave.  Beagle celebrates his awkward and probably illegal entry into manhood, dropping Georgia off at school to see her walk away like a cowgirl (because of the affliction, not Beagle's undoubtedly pedestrian efforts).  Which brings me to a point: If the sexes in this movie were reversed, the reviews and position would not be the same.  There would be countless people claiming that a rape had taken place, and that this movie glorifies perversion.

There's definite humanity here, but there are too many unbelievable scenes and misplaced emotion for the entirety to ring true.  I admit that the subject matter is difficult, and the disabled shouldn't be treated like second class citizens.  I also note, however, that she couldn't possibly care for an accident, and her pregnancy would certainly add an unnecessary burden to society.  Aside from perhaps Georgia herself, each and every character has a serious flaw that made them unlikeable to me.  Some detestable.  Maybe that's the point.  Maybe the humanity is that Georgia hasn't been tainted like the others, and her wishes are not that misguided or different than the rest of us.  Maybe, in some ways she's better (but probably not at acting).

The movie showed no agony or suffer of her disease, just indicated or hinted her troubled daily life, and that was not the theme.  So what's up?  The main event of the story seemed to be the girl's first date and sex.  For that purpose, she went to beauty parlor and cut her hair very short, that she wanted to try sometime.  From the point of view of robust, people of heavily handicapped, old, weak, or malignant disease had no interest in or not the theme to tell about their sexual fantasies.  The movie told me that's not fair.  Everybody had the right to seek own desire.  Some people said the movie was unfinished, dangling or pointless, but I didn't think so.  That's it, that was the message.  Only I didn't think the cover art of the DVD was good.  Poster art was better, though.",1274054400,,1122,4.393203883495145

This film is perfectly cast and exquisitely written as it explores the territory of generational love, as well as a Camille-like subplot of Kristen's terminal condition(not the story focus),and still delivers roundhouse performances from all the ensemble cast, particularly Bruce Dern and Elizabeth Ashley, two old studio veterans, that allows them to make up for their lengthy absences from the big screen. I have not seen a film cover such wide ground of emotions in so concise a manner so completely. Every character in this small, independent offering towers in courage before your eyes with fine shadings of flawed humanity and dignity.

portrayal of a high school girl afficted with a neurological disorder called "" Frederich's Attaxia"", which is somewhat similar to Muscular
Dystrophy, but with it's own peculiar quirks. Just as ""proof"" of her performance, after I had already seen the film, I invited a couple over to watch it with me later, and told them that Ms. Stewart was an actress who really
""had"" this disease, and how well she did in the movie. ( They'd never seen her in anything else, of course). They said they were amazed at how  well she did, given her disability. After it was over, I told them it was
all ""acting"", and that she was perfectly normal. Just listen to the Kudo's
her co-actors gave her, in the ""Special Features"" portion of the DVD.

The Cake Eaters is a story about 16 year old Georgia(Kristen Stewart) who lives with Friedreich's Ataxia, a disease that she knows will kill her, if her overprotective mother doesn't drive her crazy first.

While spending time with her grandmother(Elizabeth Ashley) who is her one escape from her mother, she meets Beagle(Aaron Stanford) an older boy who works in her schools' cafeteria, and has plenty of problems of his own.

Beagle is still dealing with the recent loss of his mother, when his estranged brother Guy(Jayce Bartok) comes back into town dragging his crushed dreams of being a musician along with him. And not to mention, their father seems to be handling everything just a little too positively for Beagle to manage.

Of course Georgia and Beagle turn to each other, and with the other just might be able to get through their chaotic lives. That is until Georgia pushes the fact that she wants to lose her virginity to Beagle, and now!

The Cake Eaters is my updated version of A Walk to Remember. Girl has terminal disease, boy is still dealing with loss and ability to love... but this one is just a little less cookie-cutter and a little more sundance.(and a lot less romantic!)

Cake Eaters, however, was fantastic. Kristen Stewart plays a young girl, 16 i think, with a muscular disorder and she is curious about the opposite sex. She meets a young man who has just lost his mother and they instantly have an attraction.

There are a couple other side stories going on that are entertaining. All the stories share the same amount of screen time but my main interest was towards Kristen Stewart and Aaron Stanfords relationship. Bruce Dern did a fantastic job as well.

Everyone's acting makes the film seem so real. I'm looking forward to showing the film to some of my friends, when the DVD is released.",1238198400,6,270,4.530612244897959

Kristen Stewart is why I saw this film. But a movie is not just to look a beautiful face. Instead, it will be a combination of all stuff together.
Besides Stewart's personality, other performance actors were not just one. The actors need to do something to gain the attention of the watchers.",1524614400,,361,4.640625

8337532,3,B001R88C72,"As a teen who suffers from many chronic illness' that keep me in a wheelchair, as soon as I read that this movie was about chronic illness, I instantly clicked on it. There were a few things that I found were pretty inaccurate or just like that I didn't agree with. Georgia clearly needed a wheelchair and I find that most kids/teens with chronic illness gladly welcome things into their life that will make things easier for them. I remember being stubborn about my wheelchair when my pain first got bad and it got to the point where now I can't walk more than a mile at a time max. I love Kristen Stewart so much and I miss her staring in movies so this really fueled my love for her today! I think that she did very well at portraying the issues that some of us have to face, like dying young and wanting to do things before that happens. I also think that this movie illustrates the love from an able bodied person to a disabled person to show that this does in fact happen. I most of the time feel like no one is ever going to fall in love with me and be with me purely because I am medically (&emotionally) high maintenance. It was really beautiful and exciting to see that kind of mixed bodied relationship in a movie like I never have before. Now I did say all these nice things, however I feel like the plot didn't really go anywhere and that it wasn't exciting enough to every watch it again. Would I recommend to everyone? no. Would I recommend to my disabled friends? Yes!!",1523404800,,1485,4.2695035460992905
8337533,5,B001R88C72,"Georgia (Kristen Stewart) wants to experience sex right now.  This gorgeous, inquisitive, straight-talking gal has a degenerative neurological disease, and she feels time won't wait for the getting-to know-someone formalities. Beagle (Aaron Stanford), gentle, sensitive, unphased by her physical awkwardness, and likewise uninitiated, is drawn to her. The outcome will be revealed.  Both actors shine in their roles.  Theres lots of old history and new dynamics between Georgia and Beagles families, and some very skillful performances by Bruce Dern and Elizabeth Ashley.  Jayce Bartok is successful as Beatles brother Guy, and exceptional as screenwriter and author of several songs. The score (Duncan Sheik) is so good, with lyrics telling noteworthy stories of their own. The opening track Lay Me Down (5 writers- do look them up) is amazing!  All filmmaking disciplines are in sync and outstanding, including directing ( Mary Stuart Masterson), filming (Peter Masterson), and editing (Landauer and Sharp).  Its an especially good one sensitive, tender, smart, and surprisingly optimistic and bold. Recommend.",1521590400,,1112,5.75
