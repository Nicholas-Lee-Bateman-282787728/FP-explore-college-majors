8089593,1,B000BNX4M2,Don't be fooled by the two five-star reviews on here (as I was).  They both are obviously connected to the movie in some way. The other one-star review pretty much says it all.  I just wanted to chime in and save another unsuspecting victim from having to sit through this excruciatingly bad movie.,1353542400,,298,4.60377358490566
8089594,1,B000BNX4M2,"Bad story/plot, dialogue -- very bad, acting...not even bad enough to qualify as so bad it's good.  You are likely to laugh at some moments of unintentional humor, but nothing you'll want to ever waste time watching again.  Perhaps if they would have fleshed out an actual story and plot and cut all the senseless dialogue that has the characters bantering worthless words and did something about the acting (different actors and/or more rehearsal time), this could have been something.  It was like filming an early draft of a bad script.",1309824000,,539,4.9010989010989015
8089595,5,B000BNX4M2,"Acting is top notch as this film captures a gritty moody street atmosphere. Daston Kalili does a tour de force job as lead, and writer and director. Would recommend for anyone looking for cutting edge new filmaking.",1139184000,3,215,4.837837837837838
8089596,5,B000BNX4M2,Daston Kalili sparks with moments of genius in his first feature film.  I can not wait to see his second.,1136332800,5,105,4.25
