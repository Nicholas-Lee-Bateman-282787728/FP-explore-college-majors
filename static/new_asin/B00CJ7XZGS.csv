5724063,3,B00CJ7XZGS,"As one reviewer wrote, the story is almost nothing but bread, however, make a note, when you translate the japanese subtitle: ""shiawase no pan"", it literally means ""Happy Bread"".  Purchase accordingly.",1376438400,3,201,5.483870967741935
5724064,1,B00CJ7XZGS,"This series looks very promising. It is based on a popular game in Japan and the plot seems like it'll only get better and better.

But here is the inherent problem with Shining Hearts. It is...12 episodes of bread. Thats right, bread. You spend the entire time watching them bake bread and sell bread and do all things involving BREAD!!! When you start episode 1 you think,""I'm sure they'll progress the story along soon. It can't all be about baking bread."" Then you hit episode 12 and you say,""WHAT IDIOT APPROVED THIS SHOW GETTING MADE!!! THERE IS NO PLOT!!!""

The characters are not bad. Some are clearly rehashed from about a dozen other shows. But any potential this series has is constantly squandered. Moments of story progression are brief and next episode they are back baking more bread. There is also a lot unsaid and hinted at but they never progress the story enough to really reveal there is more to it than just bread. It is like watching 12 episodes of filler.

I've seen a few bad animes but this one really raises the question of why they even did an entire season of it. I also question the sanity of the American publisher bringing this title here. If you want to bring a Sega game based anime to the states, bring Valkyria Chronicles. Don't bring tripe like this. Shining Hearts is a waste of time and money. Avoid it. Maybe if you are a fan of the games you'll find something here but I honestly lost all desire to ever want to play the games after watching this. When I saw Valkyria Chronicles anime, it did the opposite. It made me go out and buy a copy of it, then later a PS3 to play it and I do not feel I wasted that money.

Avoid Shining Hearts...AVOID!!!",1374019200,32,1686,4.429032258064516
5724065,2,B00CJ7XZGS,"I saw this when it was online. It was only 12 episodes. But in all that time it has now real plot, it introduces characters but don't do anything with them. I was waiting for something,but all I really got was them talking about bread. I say if u want to see I say wait until u can see it free because I know for myself I would not pay for it.",1372636800,12,343,3.7777777777777777

8582411,4,B00CJ7XZGS,"This is an ideal family story. If your looking for fast action, fan service girls etc. Shining Hearts won't be your thing. However, the story is interesting and the animation quality is first rate. A few of the supporting characters are well developed, but too many come across bland (especially the male lead who is absolutely wooden). The voice cast is above average. Not for everyone, but I've seen a few anime stories that are a lot worse. Heads up...be sure and buy the English-Dub version...the English subtitled version is really disappointing!",1470528000,,551,5.0
8582412,5,B00CJ7XZGS,Truly enjoyed this series created from a wonderful game.,1460332800,,56,5.333333333333333
8582413,5,B00CJ7XZGS,"Beautiful series. It's doesn't have much of a plot or action but real life. Yes real life despite all the fantasy because real life doesn't have a real plot for most people but making a living does play a central part. Shining Hearts is rather about enjoying a normal and average life, getting along with all those who surround you. This is a style that the Western media hardly uses to the point that most people weren't able to value it.

You may well object that real life doesn't have beautiful girls happily engaged in humble jobs. That's right, my 5 stars are to make up the previous undeserved low rankings. The price is also high, currently at $35.

 If you want a real deal on real life watch ""Only Yesterday"" ( Omohide poro poro)  Hint: it doesn't have fan service at all, despite a bath scene. One fool got surprised that it lacked all sexuality. That was because it was a family scene.",1458259200,2,897,4.451219512195122
8582414,2,B00CJ7XZGS,"Shining Hearts looks promising on the first episode, The art work and audio are good, but then it comes unraveled from there. Calling the show a light drama is a stretch. There is very little character depth and development. Characters are introduced and are almost never seen again for the most part. It suffers from the same problem that many series that are only twelve episodes do. But unlike series like Fractale and Outbreak Company that grow on you despite the shortcomings, this show was a labor to watch since there really isn't a plot or story at all.  Putting it in the same drama category as Spice and Wolf is almost unfair since there is no plot, story, romance  the list goes on. But if you like watching bread being made this series is for you.",1454112000,3,759,4.532846715328467
8582415,4,B00CJ7XZGS,"Not too violent, not too romantic.  A nice balance of both.  I particularly liked that I could watch this with my kids without a problem.",1388966400,,137,4.44
8582416,4,B00CJ7XZGS,"I truly don't understand the low reviews for this item.
This series is great if you have time to kill and aren't looking for any action.",1379462400,3,136,4.269230769230769
8582417,5,B00CJ7XZGS,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
8582418,3,B00CJ7XZGS,"It's funny how the anime industry tells us to support it then turn around and not license, and give an English dub to, anime titles that atleast try to be different. Props go to Section 23 for atleast making such an effort.

Shining Bread is one of these ""healing"" anime that show people from all walks of life reacting normally to everyday situations. And whatever major problems they end up having to deal with, they try to do something about it. If you're expecting any humiliating femdom RomCom from this show, then of course you're gonna find it boring because it's NOT ""humiliating femdom RomCom.""

More major thanks goes to the voice-acting staff over at Section 23 for their efforts. Even though it still feels sloppy and a bit unprofessional, but hey.",1377043200,2,760,4.75
