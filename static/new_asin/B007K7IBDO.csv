8518771,3,B007K7IBDO,"I wanted to give this 4 stars, but I can't This is a very good anime. Its story draws you in and is very compelling. The atmosphere is light but not juvenile, and the ultimate themes are mature.  The relationship between Shinkuro and the little girl, Murasaki is heart-warming.  One clarification, Shinkuro is not a professional mediator instead he is actually a freelance street enforcer except he is generally working for the good guys (sort of).
The critical flaw in this anime is the protagonist Shinkuro. To be blunt, he is a loser. He is not a loser due to circumstance or to lack of ability who overcomes his circumstances. He is a loser by choice who has very little resolve and is terribly nave. He has high level martial arts skills, but most of the time he does not utilize those skills because of his lack of resolve.  While watching the series this became literally maddening until I was almost yelling at my TV.  As I said the issues involved here are mature and of a serious nature and his failure to step up has serious consequences.  His naivete also causes serious problems which are then exacerbated by his unwillingness to fully utilize his skills to resolve the situations he has created.
The storyline of this series was so interesting and I was so invested in Murasakis fate that I watched this series through in one sitting.  However, Shinkuros lack of resolve made this series more of a chore rather than the labor of love it should have been.
Finally, the ending was not good. Much like Shinkuros character the ending of this anime was very, very nave.  Frankly given the extremely mature issues at stake It was NOT okay.  I will avoid spoilers, but with the future of a lovable little girl at stake you need to give us more than hope.
Overall,  I recommend that you watch this anime. However, I cant recommend that you pay $35 just to see it. It is available on Hulu.com so I recommend that you watch it there and if you really love it enough to own it then come back here and buy it.",1412467200,,2011,4.502747252747253

8518773,5,B007K7IBDO,"Wow, this series was amazing. I actually sat down and watched the whole season in one sitting, that's the first time I've ever done that and I've been watching anime since 1998. This show really gets you wrapped up in the characters, it's very well written and the voice actors did an amazing job. If you like drama mixed with some great fighting scenes this is the anime for you.",1375574400,,380,4.442857142857143

8518775,5,B007K7IBDO,Everything was going so well until the end....  i did not like the ending it seemed like he would continue to watch over her but she went back to her old life but with strong conviction showing she wanted change done immediately so she had more freedom to do as she liked!  I think he gave her big time confidence to speak her mind!  Pam,1364515200,2,337,4.153846153846154
8518776,4,B007K7IBDO,"Hi there,

I've not yet seen this DVD release, so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD's.  But I have seen the show itself and I loved it.  As a fan of the movie 'Leon: The Professional', this show hit many of the right notes for me, as its about a man taking care of a young girl.  I can't quite give it five stars as it has a few unforgivably frustrating moments in it, but they aren't enough to ruin the show for me.  However, some will disagree with that.

Anyway, I hope this does well for Section 23 as I very much appreciate them bringing this over.  I never thought it would get licensed.  Check it out!",1338854400,16,616,4.033057851239669
