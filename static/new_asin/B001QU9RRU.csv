It's a great show, gets the kids up on their feet and a few laughs out of the parents.",1239494400,15,251,3.7884615384615383

3770624,5,B001QU9RRU,I will for sure be excited to get it in the mail. Jack Black is a WONDERFUL actor and has  been in several movies with children like School Of Rock he teaches them the history of music and different ways of expressing them selves thorough music. My 13 yr old was so inspired by Jack that he now plays the guitar acoustic and electric and drums and keyboard and has a Band with his friends they practice every weekend and they are very good!!So PLEASE give Jack Black a break he is a good man.

She will though as we know her wiley ways. The Yo Gabba Gabba series is a simple fun way for kids to learn. The songs stick with them forever. Ruby will sing ""Don't bite your friends"" as she is contemplating what to do with the cats tail. Lol",1407196800,,381,4.162162162162162

Along with that it skipped. I finally called & asked for my 7.50 back because I felt I was not sent a new movie or bootleg movie. She then said I had to go through this whole mail back process I said not worth my 7.50 Lady Thanks! Seller needs more2014 feedback,1390867200,,440,4.301204819277109
3770650,5,B001QU9RRU,"My two little ones (ages 3 and almost 1) love this DVD. Very captivating and animated. Not animation like a cartoon, but this is their favorite!!!!!",1389052800,,148,4.730769230769231
3770651,5,B001QU9RRU,"With three kids under five years old, it can become difficult to find programming that they will enjoy and also avoids driving you insanity.  They go through phases, and we have been through some particularly grating phases such as Barney and Max and Ruby.  The younger two aren't quite ready for the tolerable and even enjoyable Spongebob.  Thankfully on a whim, we put on Yo Gabba Gabba after seeing one of my favorite bands were a guest on the show.  We were incredibly impressed with the show as it manages to not be annoying!  The kids love it, there are a lot of great guest stars and bands, and the music is genuinely catchy!

On to this particular set.  Most YGG dvds contain four episodes for about an hour and a half of programming.  Three of these episodes are standard fare, nothing great.  The first episode ""New Friends"" however might be the best episode that I have seen.  Featuring Jack Black as a guest star, who fits in perfectly with the vibe of the show and adds a nice dynamic.  His guest spot is unusual, most are limited to showing a simple dance or playing one song, but Jack is featured throughout the whole episode as he finds himself lost in Gabba land.

In summary, I love this show and in particular this episode.  This set doesn't have quite as much bang for your buck as the three pack, but is a worthwhile purchase no less for fans of the show, or parents who are looking for something that will not make you crazy.",1386547200,,1447,4.4356060606060606
3770652,4,B001QU9RRU,"except for the quality of the DVD which skips the topics and the show is great.

3770662,3,B001QU9RRU,"My son loves Yo Gabba Gabba so I bought this to add to the collection. Usually you would not find me saying anything but good about this show but there are 2 things I think should be pointed out for potential buyers. One is the episode New Friends stars Jack Black. Don't get me wrong, I love Jack Black. He is funny and I like him in this episode, but it is a deviation from the normal Yo Gabba Gabba show structure to pretty much have the whole episode showing steadily one guest star. This episode is all about Jack Black. If you are not a fan of his, you probably won't like this episode. The other thing I feel should be known is there is a segment where a child says ""My name is Juliet. I like to dance."" and she proceeds to dance her dancey dance I guess it is. If I had seen this before purchase I would not have bought this dvd because this little girl is in ill fitting clothes and she gyrates her hips and licks her lips. I am not a prude or a person who reads or sees innuendo where it is not and I am all for kids having fun, dancing, ect, but this particular girl (acting/presented in this manner) in my opinion should NOT be in any kid's movie or show. I was shocked and I had to rewind and watch it again to see if I was just over-reacting. NOPE! I even showed it to a friend who was like what the heck would that be allowed in a kid's show for? I feel sorry for this girl, really and ashamed for her and her parents. If that seems like something that would bother you or you would find inappropriate for your children to watch then you probably don't want to buy this dvd either. I almost hesitated to explain exactly what I thought was questionable because of some creep reading this and buying it just to see that but I know I wish I had known about it. I wish I could just erase that little bit off this dvd. Can the publishers remove this from the dvd? I know you can't from ones already sold but from future ones this should be edited out. I know they have bikinis for little girls and all kinds of stuff and it seems like there are other parents out there who try to keep this kind of thing from their kids (especially the age of kids who watch this show) so I hope this helps you to make a good decision for your family. At least preview the dvd before you let your kids watch it on their own.",1361664000,,2317,4.050108932461874
3770663,5,B001QU9RRU,My 2 year old son loves this episode with Jack Black.  He watches it over and over again and was a great purchase.,1360281600,,114,3.9565217391304346

3770667,5,B001QU9RRU,The DVD came very quickly and it plays like a dream. The only unfortunate side effect is that my daughter and son want to watch Yo Gabba Gabba...every..single...day. -.- Yay. lol,1330387200,,178,4.774193548387097
3770668,5,B001QU9RRU,I bought this for my 10 month old daughter to keep her occupied while I feed her and she's now almost 2 and still loves watching it. DVD has 4 episodes.,1324080000,,152,3.935483870967742
3770669,5,B001QU9RRU,I like how they group the episodes together based on theme.  Also love it because the very first episode my son ever watched was new friends with Jack Black and WE were hooked since then!!!  Great gift and educational distraction when you need time to clean up after your little one!!!,1321574400,,285,4.568627450980392
3770670,4,B001QU9RRU,"My grandson, 14 months, is a huge fan of Yo Gabba Gabba.  However, he screams and is seriously scared of the spot in New Friends where Jack Black crashes a motorcycle into a tree.  Just a warning.",1314230400,,196,4.27027027027027
3770671,5,B001QU9RRU,"This is a DVD that could easily become the most watched DVD in my house and I am totally fine with that. We love Yo Gabba Gabba in a super huge big way. My kids love the music and the dancing and the singing and the cartoons and the craziness. I love the people they get on the show-- and the ridiculous things they have them do. It's hilarious and awesome because you get the impression they're having a blast doing it too. It's completely silly but it manages to get across some great little tidbits of life lessons too. We watched this one (again) yesterday and my kids were singing ""Don't stop, never give up"" all night long. I liked they were repeating that gem of a message to themselves. It doesn't look, or sound, like anything else on television but in the very best of ways. Wholesome. Fun. Colorful. It's just awesome all around. I hope they keep the magic going in a really big way. Yooooooooooooooo Gabba Gabba!",1307664000,,924,4.409356725146199
3770672,5,B001QU9RRU,"My 20 month old son is obcessed with Yo Gabba and the Jack Black episode from this DVD is by far his favortie episode!  He loves the songs like the friends one, good by song, and the lost song.  I personally love singing the song ""You can't always get what you want"" when my kids are not taking no for an answer.  My son also loves the Disco Roll that Jack Black teaches during dancey dance time.  He does this dance randomly all the time!

I have come to the conclusion for most kid shows that I only need to own one dvd of the series and my kids are satisfied!  However, for Yo Gabba I NEED to buy all the DVDs because as well as my kids loving them I really like a lot of the songs too and need to buy the DVDs! Now if only the episode ""Sleep"" was on a DVD!

Buy this for any Yo Gabba fan and you will not be dissapointed! Also if you have a kid who LOVES music/dance this is the show for them!! This show was the 1st music that got my son moving to music at 9 months.",1307404800,2,971,3.849246231155779
3770673,3,B001QU9RRU,"Yo Gabba Gabba is a Nick Jr television show.  Through the host (DJ Lance), special guests (including The Roots and Jack Black along with a few others), and some weird looking full size puppets (lol) Yo Gabba Gabba teaches children (target audience 3-6 yrs maybe) to express themselves and cooperate with their friends via free style music and dance.  It is very repetitive, bright, happy, and busy and does catch my 13 month old's attention.  Sometimes my child will wave at the screen when various characters ask the audience to respond to something.  The music is mostly what I would consider ""Techno-Pop.""

Yo Gabba Gabba also has a very 70s Retro feel to it.  The costumes and puppets remind me of a program I used to watch as a kid, though I cannot quite put my finger on which one.  When I first saw it I couldn't stand it, but now both my daughter and I enjoy it and often sing or dance to the music on the show!  While a bit weird (to me), the show is fun, unique and has good messages throughout.",1307318400,3,1005,4.394594594594595

This is the funniest of all of them & my entire family-myself, my husband, 14yr old, 10yr old, & 7mth old all have watched the DVD's numerous times. We love music & Yo Gabba definitely delivers there! The songs are fun & catchy, not annoying like some tot show music can be. The songs deliver messages to your tots like ""don't bite your friends!"" & ""You can't always get what you want"". I would reccomend this to anyone looking for an educational, musical tot show that they can enjoy with there children!",1304553600,,609,4.304347826086956

3770680,5,B001QU9RRU,Let me start this by saying I'm not the biggest fan of Jack Black most of the time but I absolutely love him in this episode! This is the best episode of Yo Gabba Gabba by far! I can't help but watch it every time it comes on. My daughter 20 months loves saying hi to Jack and loves singing and dancing. This show has made strides with my daughter's communication skills. She has learned a lot of new words. It took only a couple of months to know all the names of each character. This is the only show she watches and asks for it by name all the time. I thought this show was annoying at first but has grown to love it! I also recommend buying the soundtrack too!,1292198400,,664,4.037878787878788

DJ Lance also gives Jack a matching orange costume, glasses and hat, talk about HILARIOUS!  This episode makes our whole family laugh and smile.  Most of all my toddler was hypnotized by Jack Black.

Trust me, you will learn to love them & even find yourself singing the tunes.  There are guest appearances on most shows, but Jack Black rocks! He's like a big kid himself, I get a kick out of seeing him dance around w/ DJ Lance even though Ive seen it a million times.  Even though this DVD seems like it was made for stoners, its completely harmless fun for your little person.

It's dorky and everyone makes fun of them  but they do teach good life lessons. It's not that bad. We ended up buying this one and several other ones and my 2 year old continually asks for them on a daily basis.",1257292800,,396,4.076923076923077

This was a great purchase! So glad the Jack Black episode was on this DVD- It's my daughter's favorite!
Will purchase more Yo Gabba Gabba dvds in the future!",1254700800,,311,4.271186440677966
3770694,5,B001QU9RRU,"LOVE, Yo Gabba Gabba! When I first saw this show I thought some stoner made this show. I thought this was the most craziest thing I ever seen in my life. But, my 15 month old daughter turn me around. She LOVES, LOVES, LOVES this show. When it comes on it she looks at us and smiles and then starts to go crazy when she sees DJ Lance walk on the screen. Her favorite song is ""Hold Still"". Because of this show, my 15 month old has learned certain things. She walks up to me and puts her index finger on my mouth ans say ""shh"". She says ""Gabba Gabba"", and she says ""Thank You"" everytime we give her something and sometimes when she gives you something. One person stated that you will find yourself singing these songs and it's true, I'm at work humming the songs all the time. This is really a good show for all.",1248825600,5,811,4.139240506329114

The DVD loops at the end so you don't have to push play again and again. We (Me) throw it in the player and leave it running all day. Buy the DVD your kid(s) will like it. The songs are catchy, and you might find yourself singing along or worse, singing them out loud while at the mall. Most people know the songs also(sad huh?)  The series teaches kids to share, say please, say thank you,  etc..... Bottom line is, your kid(s) will enjoy it.",1247961600,,621,4.12396694214876

It' the ONLY thing that calms her down when she is upset and also makes her laugh and dances to.  It's such a great show for toddlers and a miracle for parents:) Her fav is the one with Jac Black in it:)  He sooooo funny love him. She also loves Mini bike which is his bike he rides.  Who ever thought he would be on a childrens show but it works perfect for that guy since he is a kid himself LOL!!!,1244764800,,595,3.774193548387097

3770702,5,B001QU9RRU,"This is a weird DVD to review.
I had never heard of ""Yo Gabba Gabba"" until one day, my wife calls me into the room because she saw this commercial with Jack Black on a kids' show.  Since both of us are Jack Black fans, and we have an 18 month old daughter who seemed interested in the commercial, I figured I would check it out on Amazon.

After reading the good reviews and cheap price of $11.99, I figured, ""Why not?""
Well, after watching this DVD, I came up with the following conclusions:

1) This is a bright, colorful, music-filled head-on assault on all visual and auditory senses...which is a VERY good thing for young kids.

2) The odd cast of characters teach a number of very valuable lessons for children (ie: don't bite your friends, teamwork, like fish, etc.), in a fun, if sometimes strangely catching musical way.

3) Speaking of the music, songs range from pretty darn good, to catchy, to somewhat catchy, to grating on your last nerve.  An impressive spectrum to say the least.

4) There are a wealth of very good celebrity guest appearances which will surprise most adults, as many of them are popular with grown-ups.

5) Here's the important one...this show is almost guaranteed to be created by people who are stoned...constantly.

Now, if you like, strike that last comment (#5) if it offends you, as I don't mean to offend anyone here...but if you watch the DVD, you will completely understand what I mean.
For instance, just watch the video where the Japanese rock band sings the very manic song where they continually count from 1 to 6.
A very odd and almost psychedelic experience to say the least (the whole show is actually psychedelic)...and really the one that least seems to be geared towards young kids.

Other than that, this DVD is a super value at $12, as you get quite a bit of playing time, and tons of entertainment.

Also, and this really is the most important thing...my daughter absolutely LOVES this show.  When I put it on, she looks at me with a huge smile on her face, and claps her hands.  Then, once it's on, she stays glued to the TV until the very end.
That, my friends, is utterly PRICELESS.
Add to that the fact that even adults can have fun watching it with their kids, and you have a no-brainer of a buy.

5/5 stars for sure.",1241740800,78,2278,4.497572815533981
