7956949,5,B00005YHFO,"There's bunch of attempts by would be photographers to ""educate"" you about the subjects of photography. Here's the opposite! The great practicing photo artist shows his skills and deciphers techniques down to hand position and timing. As once upon a time, wedding pro, I'm saying that there's no other video ( or DVD) available that teaches so well.
It teaches how to position everyone, how to frame, how to avoid common mistakes etc.
Great video, very educational, very inspirational, highly recommended!",1246406400,,505,5.246913580246914
