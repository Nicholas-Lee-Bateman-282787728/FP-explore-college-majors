5942724,5,B00ESZZOM2,"I preordered and have been waiting for this show to get on dvd since Sony stopped after volume one.
Mary Hartman was way ahead of its time and so well written.
I was too young to watch it when it first aired but I do remember watching several episodes on TV Land 10 yrs ago and I loved it and so glad ShoutFactory is putting out these classic shows!",1377648000,35,349,4.072463768115942

5942726,5,B00ESZZOM2,"""For the times they are a changen."" This summer I decided to go to my past. Mary Hartman Mary Hartman we were introduced to in the summer of 75 if my memory is correct.  I was just cast into the real world from twelve years of forma public education. Oh, Norman Lear! Your were/are so ahead of your time. Network TV in 75/76 did not know how to approach this show. Mr. Lear was at the top of his game. I think ABC acquired the rights? Not  because it was in a  daytime cereal motif, that is where the executives placed it. They were to skittish to place it in prime time!  My father would come home over the noon hour for lunch from work to watch it. And I newly working, in my father's business would come home for lunch and watch it with mother and him. I have ordered this set both used and new in the last two weeks. Giving some as gifts and one to my public library. For it is timeless. And for what the country is going through today it is very pertinent to our times. I think today you could not even witness a show as great as this on network television. Thank You Norman Lear, and Bob Dylan.",1503705600,,1100,4.078703703703703
5942727,5,B00ESZZOM2,"I've had the first collection of 25 episodes since 2010 but l lost interest after the first plot complication was over, but
after looking at them again, I looked at all of them and seem to be getting more out of it, wanted to see more
and decided I might get something out of the soap opera format of the unusual type. I like the opening and closing with the pictures on table
just like some of my family use to have (muting the load voice) and when dusk makes the lamp come on; good occupational therapy.
(Although, I also saw some later episodes when broadcast on TV that seem to lack good writing and the new episodes I'm seeing now have that problem, like Charlie not looking out for Loretta in the hospital
The price of about $100.00 would be more than fair for this number of disc.
It comes in one big compartment box with 6 cases (2x the depth of first season cases) 6 disc each, nine episodes each (+1 on first) numbered 1-325, in different color cases and Mary with a real smile.  It has a 7th thinner bonus disc which includes ten ""Fernwood Tonight"" episodes.
The picture fills the screen on wide screen in correct aspect ratio. The audio is equal to the first collection and might be a little low rarely.

Unfortunately, I can only give the story two stars; After over 100 episodes, it is like it should be called ""The Stupids"". The basic premise was very promising, a charming farce of a soap opera but they threw sense and continuity out the window. Also, when Mary and Tom fight they are so loud that they could chase away all the bugs and varmints in the neighborhood; later they do it solo in any situation.

There is good news, raising it to 3 stars; at episode 131, beginning of the second season, they add 3 new writers, Tom Eyen, Margaret Goldman and Lynn Phillips. The episodes had been written mostly by Marcus, Adelman and Brown and the change is noticeable. I had thought it needed it and apparently so did Norman Leer and associates.  Even Charlie Haggers had to say ""There's got to be a place where goodness stops and stupidness starts, Loretta "" and I say, and vice versa.",1497830400,,2099,4.416020671834626

Great stuff!

Just be prepared these are 100% unedited - you have to put up with the opening credits, closing credits, and even ""next time on"" and since these are all of 23 minutes long per episode it gets a little tiresome.",1476576000,2,263,4.346938775510204

5942734,5,B00ESZZOM2,"MH2, in case you don't know, was a late night ""soap opera"" that aired for 2 seasons in the mid-70s that had an enormous impact on the popular culture, as well as ensuing culture at the time.  The humor could be dry, cutting edge, quirky -- and typical to the Normal Lear tradition, nothing was off limits... mass murder, dead nuns, incompetent doctors, cowardly ministers, accidental deaths (in bathtubs... chick soup), existential anxiety, calmatives, you name it.  Louise Lasser plays a housewife who pretty much believes everything she sees on TV and reads in magazines, and as a result, little by little is losing her insanity.  A psychodramatic comedy from the era of  Betty Friedan's FEMININE MYSTIQUE set against the backdrop of plot's that took popular soap operas of the era to the edge, I'm sure most people who've come over here considering get it would agree that it was one of the funniest and best TV shows of all time.  Small town America at its most insane!

Light on extras, for example, commentaries, cast biographies, outtakes and stuff like that, this collection is nonetheless incredible -- especially for those of us who not only loved the series but were disappointed a number of years ago by the release of ""Volume 1"" followed by... nothing.

The most amazing thing about the series is that its almost 40 years old, but feels so modern.  Yeah, Mary Hartman was the 1970s, but when you watch it, the topics spoofed, parodied and tackled still give the series its edge and quirkiness.  --As the series was so influential, younger viewers who came up on all the shows influenced by its realism/surrealism/black humor will probably get into it as well.  The Simpsons, South Park, Ally McBeal, Desperate Housewives, not to mention SOAP in its time... this show had an indelible footprint on vanguard TV.  You'll laugh, you'll think, you'll stay glued to the set -- and also enjoy spotting celebrities who'd later go on to greater heights.  Although $100 may seem a bit price, I'd definitely call it a sound investment.",1472688000,,2037,4.855491329479769
5942735,5,B00ESZZOM2,"i simply could not stop watching it!!!!!! this show came out when i was a kid and i loved it back then too but watching it over as an adult it was even better---- Louise Lasser is a genius as are the writers and the actors--- but you have to ""get it""--- its not that silly slap stick humor--and thank god there is no laugh track or that really would have ruined it---this is a bizarre, dark  almost woody allen kind of humor...i can't explain it..
it really brings you back to the 70s....not like those silly shows that claim to bring you back .....this really IS the 70s...I don't know you have to see it for yourself....The scene when loretta goes on the dinah shore show ( is that spelled right?) is one of my favorite scenes ...i think a lot of it was ad-libbed .............And there are a multitude of cameo appearances of good ol actors and comedians on this soap opera...I can go on and on.

5942744,5,B00ESZZOM2,"I had the opportunity to see disc 37 and disc 38 after owning  Volume 1 with discs 1-3 having the first 25 episodes for many years. The summary of how slowly Mary Hartman as a series came to a stunning confrontation with the consumer mentality that is the main TV promotion makes a nice transition to some Fernwood 2 Night episodes that I had not seen on TV. The characters were familiar to me from a time when President Nixon had been one of the main interests in my life. One guest on Fernwood 2 Night explained that the original Nixon had been replaced by a Soviet agent sweating profusely because of the false skin covering his face. People who knew Nixon well said he sweat profusely when he was lying. Even the mayor of Fernwood was a guest on the show. This stuff became so familiar to me, I could hardly watch TV without it. All of the characters were stunned that anyone would shoot five people, two goats, and eight chickens because someone couldn't stand it when people tell jokes or chickens argue.",1454544000,2,1010,4.45945945945946

Norman Lear Developed many of the best and most controversial show and MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN and ALL IN THE FAMILY were not only his most contraversial but they were his best. Mary Kay Place, Louise Lasser, and Debralee Scott are the very best reasons for having this complete set. Too be part of this show then and now was a thrill for me since I was able to meet Mary Kay Place (Loretta Haggars, The Big Chill.) MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN had a brief run on LIFETIME during the '90's. Buy the complete set and watch it. You'll have a love/hate relationship with MARY HARTMAN.

5942748,5,B00ESZZOM2,"The thing about Mary Hartman is her goodness and her vulnerability, the sense that here is someone who doesn't have a mean bone in her body and yet she cannot find love. Mary Hartman believed in two things: that love would find her in this world and that the stuff she puts on her kitchen floor would not leave a yellow waxy buildup and in the end she had to face the bitter truth: that the former would not and the latter did. Too bad for the world but not for naive, hopeful Mary who lived to a ripe old age, died and went to Heaven where Love itself, always and forever, finds those who yearn for it.",1452211200,2,603,4.11864406779661
5942749,5,B00ESZZOM2,"Louise Lasser is beyond AMAZING... I do wish I could find the 'fornicators' rant of the child Rev. Jimmy Joe Jeeter- but I may, yet- also, maybe one thing I won't find- a Motownish song Loretta sang in the show- maybe that couldn't be included- it wasn't a Motown song, but was a hooky 60s sounding song I am hoping to still find but kind of gave up hope. but it sounded like a sure hit, after the actress- Mary Kay Place released a hit album.

Lasser is the heart, soul and brains of this awesome dvd release.  HER work holds up better than others on the show who DID win an Emmy and she is worthy of Lifetime Achievement honors for the breadth of- nuance- hilarity heartbreak- brilliance-  Emmy winners of the time such as Bea Arthur, MTM Mean Stapleton, Valerie Harper- who is referred to and I 'think' won the Emmy the year Lasser was nominated- all are excellent.  NOBODY came close to Louise Lasser's virtuosity - subjective, of course, opinions of talent can be...Yet, no doubt about it, Lasser was a GENIUS- it's good to see her in her prime and the box is a GREAT must have for home dvd libraries.  Gushy enough?  Lasser will touch you, astonish you, make you laugh more than you expect, break your heart, MAYBE irritate you now and again-  and you will notice qualities of such rarity- her talent, her ability is beautiful to watch.  She's the reason to buy this.  Debralee Scott has some surprisingly good scenes in which she excels- usually with Lasser- the cast was good- it's great for a snowy winter when you just HAVE to wait and stay inside- Nice book with it- and I'll find ""Fornicators'' from the child yet- he wasn't in so many episodes.  Forgotten to most, likely, will be how HANDSOME Dabney Coleman was in a handful of very early episodes- he, weeks later, then had the 'character face' overtaking, so the' handsome'  actor transitioning (to character) didn't last super long- always such an interesting actor but you may be surprised at how great he looks in the first appearances, I had no idea.
Lasser will look beautiful to you many times and - shalloff- off point- SUCH pretty legs she had/ but the best of the best actors:Louise Lasser.",1449792000,5,2165,4.539845758354756
5942750,4,B00ESZZOM2,"I just received my DVDs today. I'm happy to finally have the series! I was disappointed that four of the DVD cases had some minor damage. It's not worth the hassle of returning, but it's irritating! Five stars for Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman and subtracting one star for DVD cases :(",1447891200,,282,4.549019607843137
5942751,4,B00ESZZOM2,"When this first aired, it was shown late at night in my local tv market. I was 20 and this was considered hip, weird, and wonderfully demented. How has it held up? In some ways, very well; in other ways, not so well. First of all, the performances are great. The main characters do a fantastic job of acting. Louise Lasser is such a perfectly weird, neurotic, insecure Mary Hartman that it makes me wonder how much of this was acting and how much of it was how Louise Lasser this really was. She makes the show. Her delivery is so on target - she hits a bulls-eye each time she speaks. Mary Kay Place, Graham Jarvis, Greg Mullavey, etc. are all extraordinarily good.
When MH2 is working, it's funny, fascinating, and addictive (and I'm not a soap opera fan). When it's not working, it's tiresome, boring, forced, and even depressing (we are watching MH have a long mental breakdown, after all - and it seems too realistic/unsettling at times. At times, the show doesn't seem to know where it wants to go and what it should be. Should it be a serious soap opera? A parody? Social criticism? At other times, it hits a sustained groove of clever and note-perfect satire - as if the ""Simpsons"" met ""Days of our Lives.""
352 episodes is an awful lot of MH2. I'll watch them all; I knew this was going to be a huge investment - and I didn't expect every episode to be essential viewing. Having missed 3/4 of the show when it first was aired, I wanted to fill in that void. Is it worth it? Yes, but it's uneven. I don't regret my purchase but I was tempted to fast forward through some episodes. Overall, I give it an 82 out of 100.
This boxed collection is for die-hard fans and those who were intrigued enough by the first released set of episodes that they wanted to get their hands on the complete series. Shout Factory has done a good job of transferring - just keep in mind that these were filmed on videotape not HD film.

UPDATE 3/31/16: I stopped watching this after episode 180. Why? It was too much of a downer. I think the writers thought that focusing on serious problems was a sign of sophistication. It can also be a sign of a sadistic streak if you like tormenting and humiliating your characters. Stopped being amusing. And ended up feeling like spending time with an acquaintance whose life is always on the skids and in chaos.",1447632000,15,2337,4.409722222222222

5942765,5,B00ESZZOM2,"I am enjoying reliving the series. Louise Lasser is wonderful as Mary. I watched the bonus disc where the show is discussed by Ms. Lasser, Norman Lear and Mary Kay Place. MKP was right, the casting would not have worked without Louise Lasser. The two most memorable storylines were about the problems with the Hartman marriage and the waxy yellow build-up and the Easter storyline about Loretta Haggar's faux pau on the Dinah Shore show. Loretta says she forgives us Jews for what happened to Jesus. In the 70's it was shocking. Using my Blu-Ray player, it is upconverted. I think on my old TV from the 70's with a standard DVD Player it would look different since this set is square. Ms. Lasser is supported by the late Dodi Goodman, DebraLee Scott, Victor Killian and Phillip Bruns. DebraLee Scott went on to star again as the Sister of the character, Angie, played by Donna Pescow from Saturday Night Fever and Airplane's, Robert Hayes of Airplane fame. Ms. Scott then became a staple on Match Game. Greg Mullavey did a nice job with the role of Tom Hartman. Character actors Dabney Coleman and Marian Mercer star as Merle and Wanda Jetter, the politicos of the series. Another daring storyline for the times wasa KKK type group that featured another of my favorite actors, Sid Haig.  the show also tackled wife abuse featuring then unknown, Martin Mull as Garth Gimble. After the series ended Martin Mull and Fred Willard went on to star as Barth Gimble and Jerry on Fernwood Tonight. Finally, another actor we saw a lot over the years was Graham Jarvis as Charlie Haggarrs. People like Martin Mull and Mary Kay Place went on to become important stars and Ms. Place also became a Movie Director. Ms. Place forever will be associated with the Goldie Hawn film, Private Benjamin. Louise Lasser for years was associated with Woody Allen. In the bonus disc Ms. Lasser explained why it took so much convincing to make her Mary Hartman. You will find a lot to laugh about even if you weren't around at the time the show first aired.",1427500800,11,2030,4.670391061452514

""Mary Hartman Mary Hartman"" is a soap opera, and it makes fun of soap operas, and it is also a comedy. Of course, it is dated, and it has to be, because that is what makes it so good. I love all of the characters and the storylines.

I loved this show back when it was on and my memories of it are fond.  Louise Lasser has always been great (imagine my delight the first time I saw ""Mystery Men"" and her role as the Blue Raja's mom after so many years!).  And Mary Kay Place was always so delightful.

But I think my favorite characters may have been those on the show-within-a-show ""Fernwood Tonight,"" with Martin Mull as Garth Gimble and his evil twin brother Barth, Fred Willard as his moronic sidekick Jerry Hubbard, and the always morose Frank DeVol as Happy Kine (and his orchestra), and his theme restaurant, ""Bun 'n Run"" (later ""Taco 'n Run"").  They always had me rolling in the aisles.  Nobody's put ""America Tonight"" on DVD yet, have they?

5942788,5,B00ESZZOM2,"Finally, after all these years.  I was sixteen when MHMH premiered, and I watched it faithfully every night.  It was (and still is) unlike anything else on TV.  It's paced like a real soap opera, so it's slow going, especially for today's younger viewers.  There are tidbits along the way of wonderfully absurd storylines and very clever writing.  Some of the storylines build to huge, hilarious payoffs that are best left as surprises.  Louise Lasser's performances are often brilliant, and so are Mary Kay Place's.

Video quality is that of a '70s videotaped production.  Given that, I think it looks about as good as possible.  I'm enjoying wading slowly through the episodes, waiting to savor the big surprises that I know are coming.",1418169600,5,738,4.934959349593496

5942792,5,B00ESZZOM2,"I remember my mother watching this every day when I was a kid. I was too young to know that it was somewhat of a parody of the typical soap opera. I do remember thinking there was something slightly off about it, though. Now, as an adult, I can appreciate it in all its excesses and subtleties. It's like a window into some alternate universe where the most outlandish situations are played in utter seriousness.

I feel like this was groundbreaking TV, and I'm in constant awe while watching it. As strange as it can sometimes get, you begin to realize you are actually starting to care about these characters. There's a heart at the core of this weird little show, and it can rip yours out at times.

The show deftly alternates between the mundane and the bizarre, and it can turn deeply dark at a moment's notice. It's a window into a time when you didn't have to have blindingly white teeth and perfect looks to be on TV. These characters look, talk, and act like real people, therefore they are so much more relatable, no matter how weird things get.

I'm amazed that the complete series is available on DVD, and so appreciative.",1416787200,3,1134,4.495145631067961
5942793,5,B00ESZZOM2,"What we're looking at here is 36 discs of 23 minute episodes, 9 on each disc, the first has 10, that's about 110 hours, not counting the extras. Once you start, there's just no stopping, and if you can take the pace of 1 a day, it would take just over a month to get through the whole series.

The 4 principle actors are Louise Lasser (Mary Hartman), who was once married to Woody Allen for 3 years, so you can see how she gets her wild quirkiness, Greg Mullavey (Tom), who was married to actress Meredith MacRae for 19 years and has 1 daughter, his father, Greg Mulleavy, played Major League Baseball for the White Sox and Red Sox, so that's why he's usually dressed in his baseball outfit, Graham Jarvis (Charlie Haggers) who was born in Toronto, Canada,  whose own father, John Kinder Labatt, founded the Canadian Labatt Brewing Company and Mary Kay Place (Loretta Haggers). who never married and has no children, which seems strange because of her character, she seemed to be everyman's ideal wife.

There are some brief interviews on disc 37 done in 2008 with Norman Lear, Louise Lasser, who sort of resembles an aging Ally McBeal, another quirky character, and Mary Kay Place, with a short bobbed haircut, who strangely resembles Dody Goodman, who played Mary's mother.

When you have to go through 110 + hours of viewing, then you can use a shortcut, namely the FFW button on the remote control  to skip through some of the more mundane and ridiculous moments. However, some of my favorite moments during the series were the bedroom scenes with Mary and Tom, almost all  the scenes with Loretta and Charlie, especially Loretta's appearance on the Dinah Shore show, her miracle recovery to walk again, her role as Lulu during her amnesia attack, Charlie's conversation on the phone with his 'long lost son', Loretta singing 'Baby Boy' and 'When Lulu Gets back to Town', Charlie's straight to the point attitude, Tom and Mary dealing with their daughter Heather, Mary's sister Kathy getting involved with every man she meets,-  there are many hilarious, dramatic, surprising moments throughout this series.

But if you want to save some time, you can skip through some of the more tiresome moments, such as the bantering by the mop haired Geraldo Rivera TV reporter, George (Mary's father), when he loses his mind and thinks he's an indian, some of the moronic characters in the insane asylum and also in the prison, the hysterical rantings and ravings by Mary at times and much more frequently by Martha (Mary's mother) and other characters like Garth's house-beaten wife. But Louise Lasser in the interview explains that there was no time for rehearsal for the emotional scenes because of the hectic production schedule, so that's probably why some of the scenes are totally off the wall, but that's also likely why the show is so popular.

MHMH was a real emotional ride, the best moments were from parts 2 - 5, and then in part 6, somehow the writing became too ridiculous, like the subplot of Loretta and Charlie adopting a feral irritating wolf kid, the son of the abominable snowman - too unreal, and the violent antics of the GGG Klan , a parody of the KKK, and Mary's mother moving in with Kathy's boyfriend Mac, and the obnoxious Sargeant Foley returning to chase down Mary again, the final 10 episodes of the series became more depressing than entertaining, and the final 2 minutes of the series couldn't have ended on a worse note. There were a lot of great moments. mostly in the first 2/3 of the series, then the writers changed, going for shock value, and the final 1/3 of the series was not as good as the first part.

So overall, this is definitely addictive great entertainment, controversial issues, cliffhangers, gripping and hilarious moments, a perfect package, well worth the time and investment.",1416528000,7,3824,4.771558245083208

Watching it from the beginning is a revelation. It's hilarious and willing to tackle subjects that weren't much treated on TV at the time. The low-budget, single-take style suits the show well. Lasser really puts herself out there with her ditzy, disoriented style. The lack of a laugh track and only diegetic music are big pluses.

Then again, maybe it was something other than the yellow, waxy build-up that concerned Mary Hartman such as her flashing father at the school playground, her ditzy country singer neighbor Loretta who continues to miss-carry played by Mary Kay Place, always romping with her twice her age husband sex hound-dog Charlie, her even ditzier and distraught mother Doddy Goodman, her hot and handsome all-American husband Tom and their sexually dysfunctional relationship or their neighbors, a family of five and their two goats and eight chickens who are murdered before they ever had a chance to see Loretta (named after country queen Loretta Lynn) sing country at the Capri Lounge in Fernwood, Ohio which has derailed her and Charlie from their destination of Nashville!!!

5942811,5,B00ESZZOM2,"Shout Factory is to be commended for releasing this in its complete form. I wasn't expecting a wrap up at the end, thinking back it just seemed to suddenly disappear. MHMH should have continued and may well have to this day if Louise Lasser hadn't called it quits. This ""soap"" stands as Norman Lear's ultimate achievement, even more than ""All In The Family"" which I was never a big fan. I was in the mid teen range when this first aired and recalled it fondly but was not prepared for the level of interest it sparked in its entirety. Ahead of its time and a product of it simultaneously, MHMH contains many standout performances; even the bad guys are three dimensional and most all the characters evolve several times over (Dabney Coleman's Merle Jeeter is a good example). Graham Jarvis, Mary Kay Place, Greg Mullavey (possibly his best work) - the list goes on but this has to be a legacy to Dody Goodman who left us in 2008 and we're not likely to see a warm and wacky actress like this again. She takes Gracie Allen to the tenth power and steals most of the scenes she appears in. All this and the beautiful Salome Jens, a cameo from Harry Dean Stanton, and the incredible Sid ""Spider Baby"" Haig(!) in a major role as ""Texas"" in later episodes.

""Where's the peanut butter?""

One Final Observation: There is something very frustrating about the central story in MHMH. I wonder if anyone else found Dennis Foley (Bruce Peter Solomon) as creepy (even more than Merle Jeeter at times) as I did. In retrospect, thinking about the time this was made, Foley is about one step away from Ted Bundy... he even wears yucky turtlenecks. His come-ons to Mary at times have the makings of a date rape. Lasser's very good in these scenes and her vulnerability makes me want to slap him myself. His constant badgering of Mary looks less like love and more like conquest; her character seems to be somewhat brainwashed almost like programmed cult follower. In comparison Coleman's Jeeter is comically slimy where as the Foley character has all the makings of a stalking serial rapist when you watch this in its complete form. He might've been written that way had the show aired today.",1403568000,8,2175,4.6175710594315245

It's so silly, yet it's fun and reflects with perhaps some exaggeration how ridiculous and amusing some human actions and attitudes can be. Full of satire. Mary Hartman is naive and Louise Lasser makes her unique. Mary Kay Place is delightful and her character is even more naive. Mary's mother is a satire on mothers of adult daughters. Debralee Scott plays Mary's lovable but naive little sister who lives a few days at a time and moves on with a smile.

5942813,5,B00ESZZOM2,"""Mary Hartman Mary Hartman"" is a rare treat from the 70's: it swims in the culture of its time but is elevated to timeless status due to the intelligence of its writing and brilliance of its players. I cannot imagine why this is not revered more by savvy TV consumers other than currently limited viewing options: at the time of this writing this series is not on any streaming service (except a few episodes on YouTube) or in syndication seemingly anywhere.

Do yourself a favor and watch an episode or two on YouTube (sub-optimal as that may be, as the DVD presentation is pristine) and then take the plunge if you connect with this type of understated humor.

Another reviewer commented that the show doesn't hit its stride until about 40 episodes in. This is an accurate assessment -- the initial episodes are entertaining but then the show moves into brilliance.

Episode 75 where Loretta goes on the Dinah Shore show and destroys her country western singing career before it even begins is non-stop hilarious, and you see what a comic genius Mary Kay Place really is.  Fantastic.  Well worth it, and I'm glad I kept watching the price and got it for $99 when it was on back order.  What a great investment considering how much comedy you get, and to revisit something remembered from so long ago.

Also fun are the people who show up, like James Cromwell as an inept reverend; Robert Downey, Jr's mother, Elsie, as Muriel Haggers, Charlie's first wife; Bette Midler's husband (since 1984) as a Werner Erhard/EST-like leader literally making a house call to Mary, etc.  Great fun, even the vintage product placement you can compare to their equivalents today.

I'm addicted to watching show after show, and with no commercials. I can not imagine originally watching this when broadcasted with commercials. Without is so much more addictive. So many plot themes and quirky characters popping in and out as this series continued. Doris Roberts from ""everybody loves Raymond"" is great as the outrageous flamboyant white wigged faith healer in her episodes. Just one crazy thing after another. Never boring. Louise Lasser is one in a million of comics. She owns the show with her comedy wit. This has everything, VD, Gay neighbors, shady pastors, a station wagon full of nuns, hospitals that can't keep their patients straight, loony nurses, boyfriends that date everybody in sight, union corruption and violence, eight year old faith healers, very politically incorrect, a cheating drunken husband, and thats just a few within the first 100 episodes of the total 325 episodes. You will not be disappointed and the price is more than worth checking for loose change in the sofa to afford this complete hilarious series. The drama could be current in todays 2014 era, but a wonder this actually all aired back in 1970's. Many of the issues dealt with back then are still making headlines today. Many have actually gotten much worse. The only thing you might  end up spending more money on over purchasing this boxed DVD set is buying all the popcorn you'll need to get through this gem of a production. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT !!!

You can see an ad for the MARY HARTMAN/BARNABAS COLLINS COMBO as one of the visuals up on my RIDING SHOTGUN column at Comicsbulletin.com.

Shout! Factory has done another in their long series of rarities, releasing the complete 325 episodes of this cult classic in one DVD set, a release that surprised even the shows most ardent fans. Thus, every episode of Mary is available in one package, showcasing her journey, and the sideline tributaries of her immediate family and friends, to journey's end.

The color prints are exceptionally bright and sharp. The episodes are uncut (except as noted in one of the other reviews here)and can be viewed in chronological order. (Johnny Cash must have had some agent.  The Rebel could not use its own themesong.  Even when Johnny was a guest star on Wagon Train, they cut the song he sings during the show.) Going back to Mary, In addition, Shout! has included two bonus discs with the 38 DVD box set, containing behind-the-scenes interviews with Louise Lasser, Norman Lear and Mary Kay Place, who plays Mary's next door neighbor and best friend, country singer wannabe and convinced-she-will-be superstar, Loretta Haggers.

Much more Mary and the others up on Comicsbulletin.com.
And watch out for that waxy yellow build-up!

The picture quality is superb. One thing that shocked me about the series was how much music Shout Factory had to clear to get this series on DVD.  Characters on the show (especially Dody Goodman) were always singing a few lines from a classic song to themselves at the start of scenes.  Loretta and her alter ego Lulu also covered a lot of songs and then there was music being played on records and the jukebox.  Shout Factory has managed to clear the rights to about 99.99% of these songs.  They have also corrected the problems from the first season that started with episode 22 that were screwed up in reruns on Lifetime, TV land and the last DVD release.  I thought season one seemed perfect. but did notice a few cuts on season 2.  Episode 174 is missing a few minutes because they couldn't clear the rights to two Johnny Cash songs for a scene (thanks to Jared for this info) and episode 204 is missing a few minutes.

5942851,5,B00ESZZOM2,"The original desperate housewife from Middle America--Fernwood Ohio's totally impressionable, tragic suburban heroine is back as Shout Factory resurrects Norman Lear's sublime '70s soap opera satire in MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN: THE COMPLETE SERIES.

After Sony gave us a teaser in Spring 2007 with a Vol. 1 release consisting of the first 25 episodes, fans have been begging for more, but never did I expect we'd get a release of this magnitude. A whopping 325 episodes on 38 discs that has only been surpassed thus far by MPI's DARK SHADOWS release of 2012.

I was eight years old in 1976 when Mary premiered and most of the storylines were way over my head but there was something about Louise Lasser's lugubrious line readings and childlike naivete that I found mesmerizing and my wonderfully liberal Mom thankfully allowed me to stay up and watch over Christmas vacation and March Break. The rest of the cast are equally fantastic in their roles but of course, Louise Lasser as Mary is the lynchpin of the whole show. The series quickly became such a widespread pop culture phenomenon Louise made the cover of PEOPLE, TV GUIDE, MS., NEWSWEEK and ROLLING STONE. There were even MARY HARTMAN for PRESIDENT buttons to be found that election year!

New viewers weaned on trashy reality TV probably won't ""get it""--there's extreme, lingering close-ups and the actors read their lines slowly at times (or even flub them and the production schedule was so rushed and grueling the goofs were left in), but that all adds to the realism. These shows boast some of the most brilliant, true-to-life yet often ridiculous dialogue you've ever heard--but it's never boring (Watch for Mary's reaction at the conclusion of the pilot episode when a policeman calls to inform her that her grandfather has been arrested for indecent exposure: In total distress she stammers ""I can't talk now....I'm on the phone""--sheer genius!).

MHMH straddles the two extremes between pure soap opera and satire with the many mundane occurances peppered with over-the-top events such as one character drowning in a bowl of Mary's chicken soup, or another being electrocuted when a portable TV set falls into the bathtub.

Best of all, the actors/characters are like people you would know in real life. There's no botoxed, assembly-line plastic Hollywood types on display. From balding, hairy-backed Graham Jarvis to the fabulous Debralee Scott with her severe overbite, these are actors you wouldn't see on prime time these days so it's refreshing to go back and see what TV used to be like.

If you loved this show back in the '70s or are curious about it and love offbeat entertainment, this is the set for you. With Amazon's current price and the episode content, it works out to only 54 cents per episode which is a STEAL for a gem like this.

Thank you once again SHOUT FACTORY for another rescue mission. I love you guys!!!",1377907200,63,2901,4.920245398773006
5942852,5,B00ESZZOM2,"THIS IS THE BEST DVD RELEASE EVER!!!!!  I have been collecting crappy quality episodes of this show from anywhere I could find them.  Sony only released the first 25 on DVD and I've been watching bits and pieces beyond that.  THIS SHOW CHANGED MY LIFE!!!  All of life's answers can be found in this series.  When I find myself in times of trouble, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman comes to me.  Fernwood lives forever!  So mote it be!  When it originally aired, I was a little kid in Chelsea, Massachusettes.  It was broadcast at 1:00 in the afternoon (so that kids couldn't watch it).  I would walk out of school every day and run home to turn on the tv.  The principal would call and say, ""Mrs. Dall, Bryin has walked out of school again.""  She would reply, ""I know, he's home watching Mary Hartman.  I can't stop him.  If I don't let him watch it, he's go to a store and changes the channel of a display set to see it.""  The school ended up giving me study periods at the end of the day so that I could learn my lessons directly from Fernwood.  True story.

This show is the first (and to date only) television program that portrayed gay men without an affect.  It made me feel normal.

I have been collecting memorabilia from MH2 since it originally aired.  I have a HUGE COLLECTION of Mary Hartman items including original props from the tv show and Norman Lear's original script (hardbound and signed by him).  When I moved to NYC, I took acting classes for a year from Louise Lasser.  She was great.  I think she now believes I am a stalker, but it was all about the show, not her personally.  I met and chatted with Greg Mullavey who told me that his daughter now owns his HS Jacket from the show.  I WANT IT SO BAD!!!  He took my number and hopefully one day I will hear from him.  I would love to open my house and share my collection with anybody that was involved with this show.

NOTHING HAS EVER HAD SUCH A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MY LIFE and now I am going to be able to see all of the episodes that I haven't seen since the 70's.

I had finally given up on Sony releasing additional episodes.  I have a newfound respect for Shout Factory for being so generous in giving the public all the episodes from a series that was groundbreaking back in its day.  Never before had the subjects of mass murder, flashing, m*sturbation and waxy yellow buildup been addressed on a soap opera before. Every 70's teenager wanted to see it but the show ran after eleven o'clock at night in most markets.  There was no internet back then for daily updates on the storyline.  You either had to rely on your friends, sign up to a soap opera newsletter or just plain wait for the summer to stay up late and watch.

The show was shot on videotape which can deteriorate if not properly cared for in storage.  So I am hoping that the remainder of the episodes that haven't been released yet hold up well after almost forty years.  But I am not going to complain should that happen because this complete series release is a real blessing.  I'll take what we can get!

This winds up pushing her over the edge. This show is incredibly realistic and is a spot-on social commentary on the one-sided nature of relationships.

An incredibly addictive and attention-absorbing series that is simultaneously off-kilter, hilarious, heart-wrenching, depressing and terrifying. My ONLY complaint about the DVD set itself would be the massive plot spoilers both on the back of the box and in the booklet editorials. Norman Lear himself goes on to spoil virtually every surprise this series has to offer in a matter of two paragraphs. He and the makers of this box set obviously assumed that everyone who buys this has seen the entire show already and expect no surprises, of which there are many. So I would absolutely advise avoiding reading the booklet until you have finished the series - the same goes for the interview featurettes on the bonus disc.
