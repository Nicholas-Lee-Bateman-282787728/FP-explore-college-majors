3611798,3,B001GJOL5O,This DVD is full of lazy moves that lazy people can do when they want to pretend to workout. You will not get abs of steel using these routines. You won't even burn any calories. I would not recommend this to anybody who is serious about wanting to get in shape- or stay in shape for that matter. I found this DVD a huge waste of time.,1284940800,,335,4.014925373134329
3611799,5,B001GJOL5O,"I like that there are so many workouts to choose from. I've done 3 different ones so far, but its only been a week so I can't see any results yet. I like that she goes right into the workout. The workouts target the whole stomach which I love. I will continue to do it and hopefully see some changes.",1281916800,,300,4.016666666666667
3611800,5,B001GJOL5O,"I consider myself to be an intermediate-level exerciser. Because I have the ""Sponge Bob Square Pants"" gene of a thick tummy and back fat, I needed an extra something to add to my routine to hit my problem spots. I absolutely LOVE this video!!! It's best features are: 1) it offers several routines in short segments; 2) each segment has its own cool down; 3) the routines are not standard crunches and offer full range of motion for the antagonistic abdominal and back muscles. The short segments enable me to vary my ab routines; the cool downs enable me to exercise longer than if it the intensity were maintained; and the range of motion ensures that my problem areas are targeted. Also, difficult exercises (such as planks or bicycles) can be easily substituted with lower-level versions. Although I haven't been doing the DVD very often for very long, my ever-so-critical aunt said that she has noticed that my stomach is ""coming in"" just under my bustline. Moreover there are additional bonus routines for both abs and other body areas. This DVD is definitely a lot of bang for the buck!",1251763200,10,1093,4.757894736842105
3611801,2,B001GJOL5O,I got this DVD hoping it would help me lose some inches around my mid section. This DVD does me absolutely no good. It may be good for beginners but not for me. I've done all the exercises several times and have seen no results and feel absolutely no burn. This was a complete waste of my money. If you're looking to get your body into great shape you should try P90X. This stuff will kick your butt and get you into great shape.,1251763200,,429,4.119047619047619
3611802,3,B001GJOL5O,"I read so many great reviews about this video that I was pretty excited about it whipping my abs into shape. It's still a good video but I was disappointed to discover how low key it is. I'm not an avid exerciser (haven't hit the gym in... 5 months?) but I basically end up spending the whole video making up my own variations to make it more intense. On the positive side, its segmented style makes it great if you only have 5 or 10 minutes to spend on your abs but if you want to do more or even the whole thing, the segments get annoying. They stop and do stretching and cool down for a few minutes in each segment and then it takes 30 seconds to switch to the next segment and you start all over again.",1240617600,18,706,4.05
3611803,2,B001GJOL5O,"I have been doing an Ab Blast DVD from Jeanette Jenkins for about a year now and decided I needed to change it up a little.  I bought this DVD as a recommendation from a relative who said the Abs of Steel series was fantastic.  I have attempted this on several occasions knowing that it takes time to warm up to something different.  I cannot warm up to this.  The first few segments in (not the pilates and yoga portions) the line up were moving fast and almost putting a dance routine together without giving you time to learn the form.  Just when you start catching on it's time to go on to the next move where you start over trying to learn a form.  I am happy to work my body hard, but I need solid clear instructions.  I also want to clarify that I have been working out 5 to 7 days a week for 4 years.  I'm familiar with a lot of moves and usually catch on quite fast.  For now, I'm sticking with Jeanette!",1237766400,16,913,4.084269662921348
3611804,5,B001GJOL5O,"i wish i had taken a picture before i starting doing this dvd, my abs are showing definition that has not been there for a long time. The routines are short, not overly difficult, i never was exhausted or hurting, i always liked the way i felt after doing the workout. Leisa Hart looked incredible and I can see why, her new Buns of Steel video was GREAT and this ABS of Steel dvd was AWESOME, i LOVED IT.",1234137600,11,405,4.139240506329114
3611805,5,B001GJOL5O,"I was thrilled to see that my favorite workout video was updated to DVD with all updated clothing, etc.",1432598400,,103,4.473684210526316
3611806,1,B001GJOL5O,"I had high hopes for this video because I love Buns of Steel. This program goes way to fast for uncoordinated people like me. I tried to keep up as well as I could, but it was nearly impossible. I do not feel I got a good workout, despite trying to keep up with the quickly changing routine.",1431820800,5,291,4.0344827586206895
3611807,4,B001GJOL5O,It was not the Abs of Steel I was looking for but it will do.,1427846400,,61,3.1333333333333333

3611810,1,B001GJOL5O,Too fast paced for beginners with no way to slow it down to learn the steps.  I was very disappointed since I had one of her older videos and found it quite good.,1395878400,4,162,3.909090909090909
3611811,4,B001GJOL5O,"I purchased this because I try to mix up my ab dvds i.e. pilates, standing, Turbo Jam, etc. So decided to add this one.
Will keep it around, as I like it, achieved a good ab workout.",1394928000,,182,3.945945945945946
3611812,5,B001GJOL5O,I have enjoyed using ABS of Steel.  The workout is fun and easy to do.  Good results already.  I would reccommend it to others.,1389312000,,127,4.208333333333333
3611813,5,B001GJOL5O,Great Video! This was a good work out video for times when you either had a lot of time or only a little bit. They broke it into sections so you could get a good workout in a half hour.,1384128000,2,185,3.65
3611814,5,B001GJOL5O,"It's great. I love the workout. It may not be for everybody, but it is a great concentrated workout for abs.",1378252800,,108,4.190476190476191
3611815,4,B001GJOL5O,I just play this DVD and it is really good if you just want to start building your abs slowly,1369267200,,93,3.7
3611816,4,B001GJOL5O,"I like this video.  I feel like it could have been a little more challenging, but overall I like the movements and exercises.",1355184000,,125,4.434782608695652
3611817,4,B001GJOL5O,"This video is a workout video full of smaller workouts, so you can mix and match the workout. It has yoga, pilates, and so on.",1335312000,,126,4.08
3611818,2,B001GJOL5O,"Like others commenting here, I expected something better from the ""__________ of Steel"" series, and I was looking forward to newer moves and approaches--not to mention an escape from the thongs they used to wear!  This workout is different, with interesting routines and nice variety, but the standing and seated sections were too complex to be effective. I've been working out on my own for years (and did some drill team and color guard stuff in high school and college), so I have a decent level of coordination. I'll get the choreography after a few more turns with it, but it won't be thanks to Leisa's cueing--it's almost non-existent. Good cueing is timely, clear, and specific (left hand or right, describing good form, etc.). Instead, she gives almost no advance notice and goes into new variations lickety-split from the get-go, and though she's talking all the time, she doesn't really explain much. It would be just as effective to do the workout with the ""mute"" button on.

More important, I think, is the fact that I hardly felt a thing in my abs--even though I did the entire DVD all the way through! I'm going back to my old videos.

Shame on me for making an impulse buy on a non-returnable item.",1328054400,,1213,4.712264150943396
3611819,1,B001GJOL5O,Did not like the dvd at all! I did not feel like I got a workout. It was a waste of my time.,1324339200,2,92,3.0434782608695654
3611820,3,B001GJOL5O,"I bought this thinking it was the original abs of steel with tamilee webb, but it wasnt. The dvd is ok but not as good as the webb one. They shouldnt have marketed this dvd with the same name.",1303171200,3,192,3.948717948717949
3611821,2,B001GJOL5O,"I've read other reviews and heard many say this is only good for beginners; however after just now popping in the DVD I found that it's far too complicated for this beginner.  Well, I'm not really a beginner, I've used In Home Walking, Tae Bo, and lots of Richard Simmons videos, but this one is just too involved.  You start off with what seem to be very easy movements and then all of a sudden the instructor is doing five-six part movements, talking a mile a minute, and moving even faster.  I skipped to the next section of the dvd and it was no better.

I may try it again in the future when I'm more in agile, but for now I feel that I wasted my money.",1294790400,,658,4.1171875
3611822,1,B001GJOL5O,I didn't like the dvd. It was hard to follow and I didn't feel alot of resistence in my muscles.,1293494400,5,96,3.85
3611823,3,B001GJOL5O,I love Leisa Hart.  I used the original Abs of Steel video/VHS and loved it!  This DVD is for people who already have rock hard abs or you are close to having it. Or people who want to maintain their abs. I liked the original DVD for beginners.  I thought this would be a continuation but I was wrong. The moves are harder.  Not for the beginner.,1285027200,,346,4.119402985074627

8305661,2,B001GJOL5O,"I was disappointed with this video.  The moves, which were very dance oriented to begin with and not something I was interested in, were not clearly defined.  I don't expect step by step instructions, but a little notice of what the next move is would be nice--especially for those of us with no dance background.  The lack of instructions put me behind from the very beginning.  I thought it would get better the next section--the chair section--but again, the lack of instructions made this workout not beneficial.",1467676800,2,516,4.896551724137931
8305662,5,B001GJOL5O,Love this series of workouts. Quick and easy and you feel like you did something right away.,1456358400,,92,4.470588235294118
