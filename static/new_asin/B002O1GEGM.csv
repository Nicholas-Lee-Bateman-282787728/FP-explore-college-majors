8375862,2,B002O1GEGM,"This movie is despicable, punk rock? Where? Some of the skate scenes were kind of cool at best. There seemed to be a Romeo and Juliette kind of theme going on here but this movie is low budget at best.
I would not reccomend this to anyone. Now I'm stuck with this sorry DVD I'll just donate. Waste of money!!!! No punk rock at all!",1286928000,,331,4.107692307692307
8375863,5,B002O1GEGM,"Paul Boyd hit the mark with this ""Sleeper"" of a movie. No holds barred, he hit the ground running on subject and style.  The punk culter in Los Angeles and all that that implies is illustrated in two genrational steps, if you will, father to son with both generations taking hits from the mistakes of both, thus, ""Vicious Circle."" The cinematography is second to none as are the special effects.  Both veteran and up coming actors round out this very special movie making Vicious Circle a film worth having in your collection of ""must have"" movies.",1264032000,,548,4.697916666666667
