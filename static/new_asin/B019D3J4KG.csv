Although it is a parody of The Magnificent Seven you do not need to see The Magnificent Seven in order to understand what's going on. The entire cast does a great job, but Sean Pertwee is especially charming.",1499385600,,318,4.229508196721311

8744833,4,B019D3J4KG,"There's a lot to like about this - it's reminiscent of 'Fever Pitch', 'Full Monty', 'Brassed Off'... you know the type.  The music is superb.  Just enough little nods to the classic Western to be funny without ever jarring or being inappropriate.  The performances are uniformly good, even the over the top characters (like Robert Vaughn's) are just plausible enough.  Several are stereotypes - the thugs, the Indian mother - but characters don't get to be stereotypes without an element of truth, and this manages to make them work.
The negative for me was the difficulty in finding many sympathetic characters amongst the mains for the first half of the movie.  For comedy to really work I think you have to feel for someone, and frankly most of the lead roles are pretty hard to like for quite a while.  You do figure that they'll somehow redeem themselves eventually (and of course most of them do) but it almost comes too late to care about a few of them.
That at least is a testament to the performers, if not the scriptwriter.
It's fun, and ultimately feel-good.  If you've ever played amateur football you'll probably get an extra kick (pardon the pun) from having played against, or even in, a team not unlike this one.",1479513600,,1228,4.683720930232558
