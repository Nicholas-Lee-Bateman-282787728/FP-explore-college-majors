4006369,5,B002WBYDR6,"As time goes on, more and more info about the Nazis is coming out.  Anyone who was/is involved in crimes against humanity should be held accountable.  I wasn't aware that there were some really evil Nazi women.  After seeing this, how can anyone deny the Halocaust?",1326499200,5,265,4.717391304347826
4006370,5,B002WBYDR6,This is a very good book if you are interested in History. People need to remember what has happened in order to prevent bad things happening again.,1319932800,,148,4.518518518518518
4006371,3,B002WBYDR6,"This DVD is an intersting doc, but is way too short, and covers very little of Weisenthal's,  or other nazi hunters  adult life's work, nor the Odessa file, or really much of anything regarding the 50-60 odd year hunt for  Nazi war criminals. It did mention Sophie Scholl, I'm glad to say.  Buy that DVD(Sophie Scholl).  Not all German were in love with the Meth- Maniac. I admittedly didn't note the length before buying, but it just leaves way too much of the story untold.
Nevertheless, it does tell, in brief, a take on the  situation I didn't previously own.",1317513600,23,563,4.58
4006372,5,B002WBYDR6,"While this footage is tough to watch for even a hardened veteran of gruesome images, it is essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand why it is so important to take a hard line against the forces in the world which seek to pull their fellow man apart with emotionless abandon, simply to see how she/he will react to the dismemberment.  While scholars fetishize the term ""banality of evil"", what's on display here is the full gamut of evil from banal to stark raving horror-cakes and folks, it ain't pretty.

Possibly the most difficult footage for me to watch was a silent film clip of an S.S. doctor handling a child of around five or six years old, in a way that mimicked a father tossing his child around playfully.  In fact at first it seems as if this child is laughing, but after a few moments you realize that the child is actually screaming in terror.  This footage goes on and keeps getting worse.  It was literally blood chilling for me and was terribly effective at communicating how morally bereft the people who committed these crimes were.

This DVD is not a solid wall of gore and horror.  It is interspersed with trial footage and some interesting ephemera like several angles of Goring's post-capture press conference, including one in color.  It curdles fascination to see him (and others) so pompous and at ease with themselves, freshly in Allied custody.  When inter-cut with the reactions of the war criminals to John Ford's concentration camp footage, you get a bit of a window into these spoiled visages of monsters who think themselves heroes.  As they avert their eyes in the group witness box, pretending to be shocked but somehow just not really being able to pull it off... you can tell that they actually approve of the horrors on screen.  You realize, if they weren't in that prison they would be doing everything they could to keep that horror going as long as possible.  That's why this documentary is important.  That's why it's important to never forget.

It's hard to say why people with no guilt or emotions inside them also sometimes have world beating drive and determination, but it happens.  The weird thing is, once that snowball starts rolling downhill into hell, it can be extremely difficult to stop.  Momentum is a b*tch, especially when it is gobbling up everything in its path.  There can exist things SO huge that when you're standing right beside them, you can miss that they are even there.  In this way the human mind can avoid things or try to blend them into the background because they are too difficult to deal with in the moment.  That's what this footage is like.  You will want to push it out of your brain after you see it and tell yourself ""Not here.  Not in MY house.""  But that's what people always think b/c it's a self defense mechanism.  Sort of like finding a lump while you are in the shower and convincing yourself it's nothing.  Maybe.  But every once in a while it can turn malignant so you better check it out and/or cut it out before it starts rolling down that hill.

It wouldn't be good to immerse yourself in something as foul and soul crushing as this footage on a regular basis, but knowing HOW far down a human being can go, morally, spiritually and mentally can be a great reset button for your sense of urgency against intolerance, prejudice and hatred.  Dissension and debate are essential to free society, so room should be made for all opinions.  One epic reason for this is that you NEED to know who is piping up with ideas about eradicating entire groups of people based on irrationally drilled-down specifics of things like race, religion, creed, color, sex or any other kind of diversity that unifies the race of (wo)man.  When anybody begins to express the opinion that diversity occupies a function of division or subtraction for humans, rather than a function of addition or multiplication, then you know they're full of crap and you need to raise your voice a little louder.

The DVD itself is a standard Mill Creek Entertainment release, with the disc packaged inside a black paper sleeve and then enclosed in a thick, clamshell case.  All the footage itself, while eye-averting in nature, is almost all super clear and very well presented.  Not sure how much restoration went into this but it is great quality, picture wise.

If you are at ALL easily disturbed by graphic images, then you might want to give this one a pass, but really I would encourage you to at least try to watch as much as possible.  Hearing about things like this and SEEING them are two totally different things.  Seeing it bypasses all emotional filtering or pre-judging. It is just there in all its stark reality, staring you in the face and you can't do anything about it because most of the people on screen are already dead and gone.  All you can do is look forward and move through every day with a light to push back the darkness and the humility and confidence to believe it will make a difference.  It also doesn't hurt to remind yourself exactly what is in that darkness you're pushing back.  It steels the soul against the iniquities that await it.  Many don't have the guts.  They prefer to take the easy way out... they ignore and exclude rather than implore and include.  We all have that choice to make and the truth is we never stop making it.  Watching this footage, that fact has never been more clear to me.",1309219200,152,5402,4.619496855345912
4006373,5,B002WBYDR6,"This is the best nazi hunter documentary I have ever seen, hands down! The footage is incredible (and often poignant and sad of course), and of high quality. There is actual footage of the many nazi hunting trials, as well as with Simon Wiesenthal and Serge and Beate Klarsfeld, who are the most famous nazi hunters to have existed. The producers/directors did a great job documenting how many of these WWII criminals went into hiding, and how they were ferreted out. Absolutey RIVETING, to say the least! This is a 'must own' if you are a 'WWII buff', and/or wanting to add to your knowledge or collection of 'nazi hunters'.",1305849600,89,625,4.6909090909090905

Narrator is generally likable and believable to the point that I hadn't thought about it until writing this review (if you're doing something right, nobody notices you're doing anything at all).

My only knock is the time. I have a collection of DVDs rehashing the same content over and over padding the episode/run time count. This however happens to be very interesting content that you wish they could've milked at least another disc out of. 2 hours broken in 2 episodes is a little on the light side compared to the 18 mill creek collections.

All in all 4 stars is my highest rating for one of these documentaries. So it's pretty damn good.",1418860800,,785,4.640287769784172

At the death camps, when they ran out of poisonous gas, they threw the children in the ovens alive.  Terrible events that were documented.  It goes into the Nurembourg Trial and how they were caught (kidnapped by MASAD) from other countries after the war and brought  to justice.  Worth while.

4006396,5,B002WBYDR6,"Once again, I find myself furiously angry, afraid & stressed-out, almost to a breaking point, whenever I purchase and view, yet another DVD based on the Nazi's, Hitler and Germany...I have subscribed to Daniel Goldhagen's premise that the German people are inherently troubled and possess the right chemistry for this to happen again. I have read enough, seen enough and have formulated enough information, to allow myself to peer down that most troubled road, one more time, and to actually see the German people, allowing and taking part in the most horrifying moments in all of history. An entire nation subscribed to Hitler and his Henchmen, those sadistic, those cruel, those brutal Nazi soldiers, who wiped out entire families, villages, towns, cities, in most of the nations of Eastern Europe. When a child, no more than 4 years of age, made too much noise for the Nazi's, when they were rounding up especially Jews and their children, any given Nazi soldier would grab the child by their feet and smash its head, as it crashed into the side of a truck or car, while the Mother & Father stood by, at gunpoint and made to witness this crime. It was at that same time, the Nazi soldiers would group together to laugh at the atrocity that was just created. I most lately, have found it very difficult to be involved in my religion, which is Catholicism, since I have read, over and over and over, how the Pope at that time in point, actually financed and made possible for the Nazi doctors and other high up officers, to escape to Argentina to Venezuela, to just about any other country with the exception of their own, which was Germany. They were even entering the United States, with the help and financial aid of the Pope and many other Catholic dignitaries. I find it all too sickening & troubling. The Nazi Hunters is a powerful DVD, with stories and accounts of those that thrust the world into a cauldron of fire, of death & destruction and almost the total annihilation of Jews, in Eastern Europe. If he was not stopped, where would Hitler be today, had he lived, as many have during this last stage of the Greatest Generation. There are speculations & prophecies on what kind of world we would be living in today, had he not been stopped, when the Allies stopped him, dead in his tracks. And although I love the DVD from a historical point of view, it does contain some disturbing footage on the consummate Nazi, Doctor Joseph Mengele and his experiments on young children. I will never watch that section again but did force myself the very first time to get an understanding of what I needed to feel and understand.",1386633600,3,2631,4.660215053763441

4006398,4,B002WBYDR6,"Well done in documentary style, with the usual horrifying Nazi images. Including the ones we all have seen and severe others I had not.

4006404,3,B002WBYDR6,"""Nazi Hunters"" is a documentary which covers the search for Nazis who escaped punishment after World War 2.

Much of this film focuses on a very small number of Nazi ""hunters"" and their personal stories. Some time is spent on Nazis and their crimes, and some on the Nuremberg Trials.

Good:
- The subject itself: Light is shed on this important chapter of history.
- Individual Nazi hunters and their personal stories are covered, lending context to their work.
- Historic footage is gathered here, of the victims of Nazi crimes, the Nazi hunters and the Nazis they sought after the war. I have watched any number of films on the War and Nazi crimes, and some of this footage was new to me.
- Less well-known Nazis are included, in contrast to films which limit themselves to the top ten or so Nazis.

Bad:
- Presentation of the material was not detached, which is critical for the writing of history. When documentaries cease to use neutral language, they become propaganda. Yes, it is possible to demonize even Nazis. It seemed as if each Nazi was described in darker terms than the last: They simply cannot all be ""the worst"", ""the most evil"", etc.
- Too much attention was spent on the efforts of 3 Nazi hunters. It would have been interesting to see an expanded analysis.
- This film does not stick to its subject. Focus wanders in an unhelpful way, and bland aphorisms about the War are repeated in lieu of substantive material.
- Translations to English are spotty (this film was co-produced in France), sometimes to the point of being comical. No stars off for this, but it is a bit sloppy.

I honestly would prefer to give this movie 2 stars given its unprofessional presentation, but I give the third star for the large amount of historically important footage.",1375920000,,1771,4.6485623003194885
4006405,5,B002WBYDR6,This is a good documentary about people who are still looking for Nazis even at this late date.  I learned about different people who are also involved in this endeavor and not just Simon Weisenthal who dedicated his life to this cause.,1374451200,,236,4.619047619047619

Lots of original footage that makes this film a must see for anyone interested in this topic.  Create some questions that go along with this film and your students will be glued to the screen.,1360972800,,531,4.5

4006416,5,B002WBYDR6,"As I rate this documentary five stars it denotes ""I love it"" but I mean to say HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for one can only abhor what is shown in terms of the acts of the NAZI's.

This movie is not for young kids but for teenagers yes but properly prepared. For adults it is a MUST SEE and REMEMBERED and taught in admonishment. There is only a portion and not the whole of this documentary that is HIGHLY disturbing in scenes for it plainly records the monstrousity of fallen mankind before God. In truth MUCH MORE can be shown and told that was not shown but this documentary is about NAZI HUNTERS not the monstrousity in whole of the Holocaust. They document and partially show the MONSTROUS INHUMANE acts of the Third Reich to understand WHY these men needed to be hunted down for justice. Thanks be to God there were some moved to do so in relentless pursuit. Once again though people forget, revisionists arise and the cycle (it seems) starts again.

To shy back from seeing this film is to do yourself and your teens an injustice. There is great fear even within our own nation (USA) of what is arising in terms of totalitarianism though it has yet to reach a monstrous bloom. Those who lived under totalitarian regimes and moved to this nation know the banter and propaganda of the demagogue and are in great wonder WHY the people are so apathetic and willing to throw away the nation for what they ran away from.

The inquisitions of many different types and groups of dictatorships that has risen in our world's history is NOT AT ALL limited to the acts of the National SOCIALISTS of Germany but in the same century other monsters arose and some still reign today. There were many others further back in time. Can they all equate the NAZI's? No, but some exceeded them.

May God be merciful and grant us deliverance from these devil's children, yes even in our own nation by His grace.

I must say that which is shown is brutal, perhaps as some have stated ""seen before"" but one cannot stick his/her head in a hole to hide from this temporal evil age's reality lest we repeat it in utter foolishness before God.

Yes, the horror of the Nazi seemingly playing with a young female child, you note that she is naked as he lifts her up and down and for a mere moment you think she is laughing and until it is clear she is TERRIFIED as he handles her like a rag doll and you know that death awaits her in his murdererous hands or another like him. It will strike you to the core with utter horror, anger and it is an utter warning of letting such depravity gain such a foothold once again under the placebo tongue of propaganda lies or once having a foothold then by shere brute force. A promised utopia by the hands of mere fallen men to a dumb down audience becomes an excepted delusion that leads to brutality and devilish monstrous tyranny.",1358726400,4,2841,4.432950191570881

German kids forced to carry corpses out of concentration camps for proper burial immediately after the surrender of Germany; that's brutal.  A Nazi bureaucrat strung up by the locals in some corner of Europe, only the hangmen can't get the rope right and it takes three attempts to hang the guy.  That's brutal.  If you have any interest in the immediate postwar of Germany and how so many Nazis got away and you don't want the Odessa story but the real one, look no further.  This documentary is what you've been searching for.  This film is top notch.",1339113600,3,778,4.553956834532374
4006427,5,B002WBYDR6,"I found it so hard to watch, but I had to, I wanted to know why these Nazis could do this to mankind in the name of mankind. Tell me, is there a answer to this. I don't know if there is one at all. God bless those the millions who die by these unhuman Nazis in the camps like Auschwiz, Ravensbruck, Buchenwald, Sobibor and other concentration camps of death. God had took them all to heaven with love even if they found it hard to still believe in God at their moment of death. Please! never let it happen again. I hope we all learn from films like this. More than a film, very hard to learn that in history could be like this and that man could do this to is own kind, hard to watch this film at times. 5 stars. I do own this film. Never forget Holcaust of Nazi death camps. To some who read this, may want know why, if there is a God, why would this happen at all. I don't have answer at all to that question. Only time know the answer as time it is forever, not man or mankind.",1338681600,7,980,3.92964824120603
4006428,4,B002WBYDR6,This film is very informative and shows some details about NAZI atrocities that you will not see on TV.  It is the most disturbing film that I have ever seen and I do not recommend for the fainthearted.  I am glad I have watched it however.  We need to know how bad things really got in WWII so mankind will never slip into the same darkness again. There is no glory in war.,1337040000,10,374,4.095890410958904
4006429,5,B002WBYDR6,"like my title says, i just got done watching this documentary and its the best ive seen and im my 30 years watching this kinda stuff ive seen many,when i first started watching and the disclaimer came out i told myself ""yeah yeah they always say that"" well in this one they mean it!! very very graphic,i kept telling my friend that there was no way this thing was 7 or 8 bucks,its that good, so needless to say if you see it buy it, mine came with another dvd about hitler's rise to power that i haven't seen yet, i found mine at wal-mere but here is the same price, enjoy!!  ps, don't watch this if you had anything to eat in the last hour or so.",1336694400,4,647,4.0546875
4006430,5,B002WBYDR6,"This is a very well put together documentary that just gives you a front seat to the horrors of the holocaust. Be aware that in the beginning of this documentary they will show you the full force of what Nazi Ideology did to the peoples across Europe and the horror of the aftermath ( what we call the holocaust)

This is very very GRAPHIC! Be warned as I have hundreds of titles and very few have been put together to show you the holocaust in such away on film. This makes this title very unique and also a sad reminder of what Nazi germany brought upon the world.

This film will show you the full extent of what was done in the name of the third reich in the beginning and from there it will dull down a bit as they do show actual very real and resilient people that make it their lives to bring to justice these monsters whom still are hunted to this day. If you are interested in very interesting and educational films of the war then I will suggest this title as it is prized in my collection, for the price you cannot go wrong. This has much more footage than Night and Fog, also many more films in the genre but this is not for the feint of heart and it certainly is not for children to see

I'm currently watching it again and was compelled to write a review on it, even after all I have seen of the war on film I needed to take a break from the imagery myself. My family was from poland and I always try to remember for them, thankful that I am here. This should never be forgotten",1336608000,5,1492,4.102739726027397
4006431,5,B002WBYDR6,"I picked up this documentary for a fair price and was very glad to see i had not purchased a bunch of government archive films stuck together (for example, the nuremberg trials) with the narrator with voice that went extinct in the 1950's. It is well put together and follows through on its title as it details both the Klarsfelds (serge and beate) and simon wiesenthal's work in the decades since ww2. The film footage of the old men running down the street trying to get away from Beate Klarsfeld is out of the twilight zone - it is unreal. I do want to mention that this DVD is the most graphic i have ever seen and in my DVD collection that includes both ww1 and ww2, there is that nothing approaches footage of one collaborator's execution: tied to a chair, but with his back to the rifle squad, the top third of his head is taken of, but he remains upright. a priest walks by and looks into his head as blood pours as if out of a pitcher. all the while, soldiers are walking past. Also, the nude Holocaust victims scenes were every bit as graphic. I do not think, with a topic as serious as genocide, one can ever look upon graphic scenes as gratuitous. this is what happened.
If you can handle seeing it as it really happened - all of it - no fuzzed out mid sections of corpses and all executions shown in entirety, buy it. it's worth the history of the two greatest nazi hunters the world ever knew: simon wiesenthal and the klarsfelds.",1336348800,27,1444,4.332103321033211
4006432,1,B002WBYDR6,"Before I purchase any Dvd ..I make it a point to always check the regional setting.  But this one doesn't seem right as advertised. It won't work with my player. I need an all regions Dvd. Also, be truthful with your print ad.",1335052800,7,226,4.255813953488372
4006433,5,B002WBYDR6,"This dvd actually shocked me, and no movie has done that for a very long time. I have been studying the Holocaust and WWII since high school, over 20 years ago, and I thought I had seen it all. There is new material in here that I had never seen before. Probably the worst one was the SS doctor manhandling a young girl; I almost turned my head because I really thought he was going to break her neck on camera. He came just short of that, and the child's terror and agony are plain to see. We also see graphic images of executions, and not just grainy images of human-like shapes falling into a ditch. There are clear, bloody shots of half a man's head blown away and blood dripping out. We see the actual hanging of Amon Goeth from Schindler's List, (it took three tries to hang him) and there are other nauseating, graphic images that I will let the viewer discover on their own.

This is one dvd where you should take the ""mature audiences only"" warning very seriously. Kids and young teens have no business watching this. The violence and gore in this movie surpasses any Hollywood movie because it is all real. It leaves no room whatsoever for Holocaust deniers; not that facts make much difference to them anyway. This dvd makes it painfully clear why people devote their entire lives after the war to tracking down the surviving Nazis. Disregarding threats, arrests, assaults, and bombings, their stories are told here. This dvd is very much worth the $5 or so.",1330214400,13,1469,4.522556390977444
4006434,3,B002WBYDR6,"As mentioned by another reviewer, it is hard to imagine how low a human being can go, until you recall Susan Smith drowning her own children.  You don't need to be a Nazi to become so heinous.

Great footage and faily good narration.  I must admit is was a little slow and boring at times, but this DVD is a good reminder of what sinners we humans are and if not for the grace of our Lord Jesus, we would have no chance at all.",1329264000,8,427,4.0

8382940,1,B002WBYDR6,"While some of the footage is unique, there are too many cons against this, and I'll get the big two out of the way:

-Narration:  I can't tell if this is a computer voice doing the narrating, or if it's someone for who Americanized English is not their primary language.  It's very very very very ve-ry dry, and many words are mispronounced.

-The Wiesenthal Worship:  Wiesenthal's involvement with capturing Eichmann has been revealed to be minimal at best, and this has been open knowledge for a very long time. But here this is,at one point saying that a single stamp helped clue Wiesenthal in to Eichmann's location in Argentina.  Now, that's not the only example, but it's such a glaring one it has to stand out.

Unfortunately there have been many documentaries called ""Nazi Hunters"", but two series are far superior.

One can be found here:  [...]
and the other here:  [...]

I would recommend those two series, along with reading the books by Guy Walters and Neal Bascomb any day of the week.",1460851200,,1000,4.689655172413793
