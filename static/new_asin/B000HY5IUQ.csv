She's still crying as I write this and after watching the first ten minutes to see what the deal is, I turned it off (racial epithets, drugs, probation and prison all in that short time).  Note to self and others, just because it comes with Benji don't assume it is OK for children.",1324425600,2,415,4.215189873417722
8142482,1,B000HY5IUQ,"A horrible addition to the ""DVD Benji Dog Tales Collection"".. don't watch this expecting it to be a boy/girl and her dog story.. its not... here's my review on the collection..
I can't believe anyone would be so cruel as to put one of these features in a collection about dogs. ""A collection of Dog tales indeed"". In the Castle Rock DVD, they kill the dog with a gun shot after it chases the heroine down and bites her companion.. Do dog lovers want to see the dog turn on the humans and then get shot? This DVD is simply a marketing ploy created by immoral people who only care about milking the public for a few more thousands to line their bank account. A law suit against GATAM media for false advertising would be welcome by me. The DVD menu is completely unclear as well. What do you expect from people who are soulless! Dogs and humans alike will hate this one.",1293321600,3,868,4.331288343558282
