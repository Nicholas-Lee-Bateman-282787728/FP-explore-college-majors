8505490,4,B006WA0DWW,"Perhaps the principal legacy of Romantic Ballet is dancing en pointe.  Yet it received only glancing mentions.  The effect was on a par with the settings and sensuality.  The choreography for the reconstructed dances was presented more as an aid to learning it, that as something which would make stars of the dancers.  They were safe and tame when they should not have been.  I wanted to know how Fanny Elssler danced, more than the steps she danced.  This is inseparable from the discussion.",1402704000,,493,4.809523809523809
8505491,5,B006WA0DWW,"This is such a clear presentation of the Romantic period and how the dance fits in to opera, ballet, and culture in general. The demonstrations are beautifully danced and they are works often referred to that come to life here. As a DVD the viewer can watch parts and also see it as a whole.",1358467200,,291,4.3090909090909095
