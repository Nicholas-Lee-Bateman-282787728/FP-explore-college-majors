2907615,5,B000TPTCPK,"This dvd has 3 incredibly fun and easy to pick up workouts. I was laughing and panting as I followed along to the fantastic soundtrack. The moves were sexy and quickly learned, then strung together in a dance just like some of the ones I've seen in Bollywood movies. An excellent buy for anyone looking for an enjoyable workout!",1190332800,6,328,4.576271186440678

Estoy encantada, recomiendo este video a todas las chicas que esten interesadas en  poner variedad a su rutina de ejercicio y a las que nunca van al gimnasio, lo mismo: esta es la mas divertida forma de ponerse en forma desde casa.",1189987200,5,301,4.679245283018868
2907617,5,B000TPTCPK,"What a great concept! I bought this a little while ago on a trip to Europe as a gift for my wife and she loves it. She collects all sorts of fitness videos and this is one of her favorites. It's cool to see it available here.

Bollyrobics combines the elegance of Bollywood movies with the energy of a workout. It looks and sounds great, but most importantly, it's FUN!",1189987200,5,369,4.271428571428571
2907618,5,B000TPTCPK,"This is the most fun you can have while exercising.  My wife and I tried to learn the moves and were laughing so much that we didn't even realize how much we were sweating.  The songs are great, the dance moves easy, and the teacher is very clear.  I wish there were more songs though, a sequel would be great!",1189641600,6,310,4.133333333333334

My daughters -8,12 and 15 - all LOVE LOVE LOVE the music and the choreography is not just good exercise, it's been incorporated into some of their performances! It's fun, exotic and - if you're already into hindi films - you'll get a kick out of all the catchy songs they use.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bollyrobics-Dance-Workout/dp/B000TPTCPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bollyrobics Dance Workout</a>",1189468800,4,575,6.024390243902439

2907622,5,B000TPTCPK,"If you like dance workouts this is a definite go! I love bollywood movies so I was thrilled to discover this DVD. At the end of the first routine I forgot that I was working out. You most likely won't get the whole routine in the first go but you do get a good workout. And when you do get it down pat you can move on to the next one (or not, it's up to you!). I've also tried Hemalaaya's bollywood workout and I have to say I like Bollyrobics better. It's easier for me to follow along with and more of a workout too. This is definitely one of my favorite workout DVDs!",1273449600,2,570,3.965217391304348
2907623,2,B000TPTCPK,This was the slowest dance workout I have seen yet.  There must be about 15 minutes of just toe tapping.  Also a scarf dance.  Moves are repeated over and over... you get it.  The only good thing is the finale song!,1265673600,,215,4.170731707317073
2907624,4,B000TPTCPK,"I just now got to try the dvd and it's so much fun! I love the fact it has my favorite song (Chaiyya Chaiyya) and the other two are fabulous. I'm just sticking to Chaiyya Chaiyya and I can't make it to the performance just yet but Julia is pretty good at simplifying things and making it fairly easy to understand. However, I do have some complaints that overall are pretty minor. The hand movements aren't necessarily difficult but I would have liked the camera to have done a close up for a few minutes of her hand movements so that I can understand them better. Also, there are times when I would have liked the camera to have shown more close-ups of the leg movements too because there were times when it was hard to see what the legs were doing since it was from the front. It was pretty much left up to me to do guess work ^_^ Still, this is a lot of fun and I'm going to enjoy learning all the dances. I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to get a taste of Bollywood dancing as well as get a great workout. You'll be sweating but you'll absolutely love it!",1255996800,4,1078,4.1875
2907625,1,B000TPTCPK,"Bollywood music always gives me a jolt of energy, so I thought a workout that uses it would create a perfect exercise routine for me. But ""Bollyrobics"" completely soured me on the idea.

At all times on this DVD, there are three things going on for you to follow and none of them are synchronized. The dancer does not move in time with the music, and the narrator randomly shouts out ""1,2,3,4!"" in a tempo that matches neither the dancer's timing nor the music's. Consequently, you never feel ""in the groove"" because you're always off with atleast two things.

There is absolutely no effort made to describe any movement--absolutely no attention to form. The narrator doesn't describe it (the dancer is mute throughout the DVD), and the static camera work doesn't show different angles. In fact, with the exception of the dance portions of the DVD, there is only one person on the screen and the camera never moves. It is impossible to see details like hand motions or what position the feet are in. This video DOES NOT TEACH anything. No useful information is verbalized. You are expected to simply watch and copy. I expect more from a workout DVD.

The production values are as low as it gets. It looks like the dancer stuck a video camera in front of a green screen in her basement and called it good. During the dance section three figures are shown, but they are the same woman reproduced three times. The camera seems to sit slightly below her, which foreshortens everything. With that, the lack of helpful angles, her dark clothing and a poor visual quality that looks like a bad VHS copy, it's just very difficult see the details.

After the ""warm up"" and ""step by step,"" there is a dance section that uses all the previous moves. The problem is none of them were given names in the ""step by step"" segment, so when the narrator yells out ""Temple!"" you don't have a clue what to do until you SEE the dancer do it. And again, since you were not taught the transitions from move to move, you are left tripping over yourself to catch up.

I'm so disappointed in this DVD. It's so frustating to have purchased a product that fails on all levels. I hope you save your money.",1255564800,16,2176,4.540816326530612
2907626,5,B000TPTCPK,"This video is fantastic. A decent workout, and you feel like you're actually getting some dance skills to boot. I recently watched the music video (movie clip) for Chaiyya Chaiyya, one of the songs used in Bollyrobics, and the Bollyrobics choreography is just a modified version of the actual choreography. So it's the real deal!",1247702400,2,329,5.0
2907627,5,B000TPTCPK,This is a fun workout DVD. It isn't terribly difficult to follow. This particular item appealed to me because I'm a fan of Bollywood.,1246579200,3,133,4.583333333333333
2907628,5,B000TPTCPK,"This is a great video for beginners.  The workout is not a really heavy one, but she does an excellent job with the step by step teaching and the music is fun.  It does require a veil for some excercises, which is not a typical item that one has, but it is a fun way to learn a little Indian dancing moves.",1243814400,3,306,3.9193548387096775
2907629,1,B000TPTCPK,I was very excited to get this DVD workout because the other reviewers gave good reviews. But I was disappointed. The 3 dances are very short. Too short for a workout. I think some movements should have been incorporated in a warm-up or cool-down and not in the aerobics part. I am a dance instructor who loves to add some Bollywood dance movements to the routine I teach. I did learn a couple of new good moves from this DVD. But that's all.,1242604800,5,442,4.337349397590361
2907630,5,B000TPTCPK,"Now here is the workout for you! This video is a fun filled, exciting workout! The music soothes your soul while the pounds disappear! The level of difficulty I would say is medium. It is a very adaptable (to your needs)workout, even if your not in great shape. Just follow along, and before you know it, you will be dancing like Bollywood! It is a feel good workout for all ages! And, like I said, it's FUN!",1241395200,3,408,4.311688311688312
2907631,5,B000TPTCPK,"This video does not have the glitz and glam of some workout videos. The production is very simple, no fancy sets, no glorious costume changes. But what it lacks in scenery is more than makes up for in substance.

Each of the three dances has it's own warm up and workout section. The thing I like about this video compared to may of the other bollywood workout videos is that they are not turning bollywood moves into a workout. They are teaching you a dance number and that is your workout. To me that is much more enjoyable than a dance/setp aerobics mix that many bollywood workouts use.

The music is great, and I love the veil routine. It's helping to shrink my flabby arms! It's not going to make your heart race or tire you out like some videos will do but it's a nice light workout to get you moving and do on days when you think ""Can I find any excuse not to work out today?""",1236902400,12,884,4.224852071005917

2907634,5,B000TPTCPK,"After watching ""So You Think You Can Dance"", I really wanted to learn Bollywood dancing, but there is only one class here, and it's too far. I bought this video after reading the reviews, hoping that it would satisfy my deire. THIS VIDEO IS GREAT! I wouldn't use it as a workout, but I do it in conjunction with another workout such as the treadmill. Basically I wanted to learn how to do Bollywood dancing, and that is what I am learning. It's fun, energetic, sexy, and well worth the money! I LOVE IT! btw--GET A SCARF! You'll need it.",1223078400,5,537,4.38
2907635,4,B000TPTCPK,"I think this is a fun workout, but I will not use this to ""get fit"".  The actual dances are too short to do anything but get your heart rate up for a brief time.  The moves are fun which makes this is a great addition to my routine when I don't have time to do a more involved workout.  The voice over lady that does the counting in the step-by-step is off beat and difficult to follow, but if you get through the step-by-step bit of torture, the dances are fun, flirty, and fast paced.  Good times overall.",1221609600,3,507,4.090909090909091

2907637,5,B000TPTCPK,"The production value is somewhat lacking, but you use it for the workout, right?  This is definitely a fun way to get in a workout.  The dancing and music are so much better than typical aerobic workouts.  The dances are challenging at first, but I found the instructions plenty helpful.  It is exciting as you continue using the dvd and slowly get better at the dances!
I don't have a lot of experience with other 'bollyrobic' type videos, but I like this one more than the Honey Kalaria videos, it feels more like choreography with the workout which makes it more entertaining.

And the music is just great :)",1215388800,3,611,4.568807339449541
2907638,3,B000TPTCPK,"This is a great dance/fitness DVD for an advanced student or an ambitious beginner.  By the end of the 1st song (Maahi Ve), you WILL be sweaty, but smiling, because you will have learned a fun, energizing choreography.  I had a lot of fun, and that was only the 1st song.  You can choose which language to learn the dances in, and even choose no narrator for ""performance"" mode.

I wish the production value was a little better, but you get used to the static camera angles, and green screen background.  I also wish the DVD came packaged with the recommended silk ""veil.""  The choreography for ""Maahi Ve"" would have made more sense if I'd had the veil to go with it.  If you look inside the DVD cover, they give you a website to purchase their recommended size veil... after the fact.

So, put a bindi on your forehead, channel your favorite Bollywood actress, and dance your way into fitness!

2907640,5,B000TPTCPK,"I bought this DVD together with another one by Heemalaya's and BY FAR THIS IS THE BEST! It has a great and easy routine, in several Languages (which I love since I can practice Hindi, and can see it with my friends either in English or Spanish. Although more languages are available). Julia Casper is a very good dancer and not just an aerobics freak (which was my impression of Heemalaya's DVD). Therefore the movements are very graceful.

It has 3 routines of great Bollywood songs and they all start with a warm-up, then she leads you little by little to all the beautiful steps... and she makes you sweat!!! (I barely sweat... until I did these routines). Then it is dancing time to Sharuk's music and finally the cool-down exercises. I LOVE THIS DVD.  I hope they will produce more routines later on. ... and by the way, this DVD really has Bollywood music unlike the other one which pretends to... but has more a Westernized version of Bollywood.",1210204800,18,952,4.594117647058823
2907641,5,B000TPTCPK,I dance to those three songs everyday and it is a great work out. I also found that it offers music-only feature so that I can dance for my guests. I like the three songs chosen in this dvd and am waiting for more this type from Julia Casper.,1209427200,6,242,3.9591836734693877
2907642,5,B000TPTCPK,Absolutely love this DVD!  It's so much fun to do and you really feel like you've accomplished something when you finish.  Great as a group workout or to do on your own.  The warm up & step guide really prepare you for the main dance and the more you do it the better you get.  It's easy enough to understand and is extremely fun...always great to be getting an amazing workout without feeling like you're actually working out.,1206144000,3,427,4.435897435897436
2907643,5,B000TPTCPK,"This is my favorite Bollywood-type video. It gives you three routines to learn to specific songs. The movements are well broken down and fun to follow. From the title, you might expect that it will be like an American aerobics class with some Bollywood dance moves slipped in, but it's not. It's what I imagine a real Bollywood dance class would be like. Exactly what I wanted and I wish there were more from this producer/instructor.",1205020800,9,434,4.723684210526316
2907644,3,B000TPTCPK,"This dvd was kind of boring for me. Its this one lady dressed in black with a computerized background. I could have made it myself. The moves are easy.

2907645,5,B000TPTCPK,"I really like this exercise video.  It's different from the typical western styles of aerobics.  The dance moves although fun, really give you a great cardio workout.  The hand and arm routines took a while to master and, to  my surpirse, made me a lot more graceful.  This is a great video!!",1204243200,3,292,4.538461538461538
2907646,4,B000TPTCPK,"This DVD comes in several languages: English, Hindu, Spanish, French, Japanese & music only (same beat for all menu choices).
It has 3 different dances, Maahi Ve, Chaiyya Chaiyya. Each section is 30-35 min each w/a warm-up, step by step, the 3 min dance performance itself & a cool down. The warm-ups & cool downs are all the same for all 3 dances.

From their website:
Songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""Bombay Dreams"" and the Bollywood film ""Kal Ho Naa Ho"" (Indian Love Story -- Tomorrow May Never Come) featuring Shahrukh Khan provide the music to 3 dances, each with an increasing level of difficulty and unique style which varies from playful and sensual to dynamic and powerful.

The woman on the dvd, Julia Casper, is the one dancing. At the dance portion, it's just her 3x with computer graphics.
Warm-up - uses basic dancing you will use to get you into it before the step by step portion.
Step by step - shows you the moves, she does break it down, such as only showing the veil first, then the veil & feet & then finally adding the hands. She even does it at a slower pace for faster moves before going normal speed. Each move is done at least 4x if not many more times. She gives great body movement cues, not just counts in 8s.
Cool down - is nice, added head rolls like the warm up, but also adds some standing fwd bends, lunges to really stretch.
I enjoyed Julia's presence, the breakdown was easy to follow & I felt more aware of my body to move better. I don't like this style of dancing as much as Latin or belly dancing or even hip hop, but there were a few moves I thought were great. Julia's style actually encouraged me to get into it more then I would have.
I took off 1 star because of lack of music during the step by step which made it drag on & boring (music only option will come in handy if replay it at later date). Though practice repetition is great & needed for any dance instruction, with the slower down & breakdown, there did not need to be so much, especially on moves that would not get the heart rate up. If these were aerobic moves, that would be great as exercise, but most were easy & required little physical effort.
After completing the step by step once, I will only replay the dance portions only for aerobic workout. I would love for Julia & production to put out more dances of different styles with my suggestions in the future.

Their site is bollyrobics com & all 3 dances are on youtube in all the languages.",1195948800,58,2459,4.341304347826087
2907647,5,B000TPTCPK,"This dvd is all about the fun, it will get your heart rate up without you even noticing. What I particularly like about this workout is that it is a choreography that actaully follows the music, other dance workouts I've tried just have the music as a filler, but not this one and that makes it a lot of fun.

It has three dances with warm up and cool down section which is the same for the three dances, it also has a step by step section for each dance, that is really helpful in case you have a hard time following the steps.

I think this is a dance workout for regular people, instructors or professionals may find it too simple but no less fun. If you're fond of dancing workouts you won't regret your purchase.",1195516800,4,717,4.226277372262774

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with no or little dance experience because the pace is somewhat fast and she doesn't ""break it down"" but if you have experience you should get this dvd.

The 3 dances each start with a warm-up and end with a cool-down, are broken down into easy to follow segments, and are set to music that is actually dance-inspiring. The production quality is a little silly (or maybe just BASIC)--sort of Euro-90s but, that said, very fun.

During the workout, it is just a single unsmiling dancer with a green-screen background and the music is the same for all 3 workouts--enjoyable at first but gets old fast (the music for the actual routines is different and great).  The warm-ups and cool downs are also the same for all 3 workouts.  Some of the moves are a little confusing at first but she repeats them many times.  I liked how she built up the moves to the whole routine--starting with the feet, adding arms, quickening the tempo for each step before moving on to the next combination.

8210292,2,B000TPTCPK,"I like to dance, but I'm not very good at it.  I'm a bit of a klutz.  I'm familiar enough with Bollywood style dance that I thought that this would be a good addition to my dance DVDs, and another fun dance/workout.  I wasn't thrilled with this DVD.

When it comes to Bollywood style dance, I'm a beginner.  I have a couple of Bollywood dance DVDs, and I figured that trying a Bollyrobics DVD would be excellent.  This dance workout is by no means for beginners.  Some familiarity with Bollywood style dance is definitely needed.  I tried to get through one of the three dances on this DVD.  I couldn't get through the step-by-step.  I have enough coordination that if someone walks me through a dance, I can do it, I can learn.  I learned and was able to do a fairly fast waltz for my wedding, so it's not like I have two left feet.  But this...this I just couldn't do.  I felt that the transitions were too quick.  Maybe I'm still very much a beginner, but I need the steps to a dance taught to me more than 2 or 3 times at half speed before going into full speed.

I also really didn't like the woman who is doing the dances on the DVD.  She didn't seem to be very enthused about the dances.  She's an excellent dancer, but she doesn't seem happy about it, at least during the step by step portions.  I sat down and watched the actual dances, and she half smiles a couple of times during them.  The fact that she doesn't speak the whole time is disconcerting.  She came across as very robotic, and against the digital backdrop, rather cartoony.  Like it wasn't a real person on the DVD.  The voice over was alright.  Not very informative and helpful, but pleasant sounding.

There are no extras on this DVD.  Most of the dance workout DVDs I own have at least a bonus performance by the dancer.  Absolutely nothing.  The only ""perks"" beyond what look like good dances is a choice of voice over languages.  So if you're brushing up on your German, Hindi, or whatever while you learn to dance, you're in luck with this one.

I did like the music on the DVD.  It did make me want to get up and learn to Bollywood dance.  The music, I think, is the one saving grace on this one for me.  At least I enjoyed something on this DVD.",1332288000,,2227,4.266187050359712

I got bored pretty quickly and the background graphics were distracting to say the least. It was kind of cheesy and ridiculous. Also, it is a British-English person narrating for the English version. It was at times hard to follow the narrator as she did not always follow with the movements.  Sometimes she was ahead or behind of the movements.  I quit doing it after about fifteen minutes.  It would be good for people looking for a less strenuous workout routine.  I liked the music, just not what I imagined.",1304812800,,625,4.553571428571429
