1776631,5,B00006II6I,My kids love to sing along with this DVD. It's amazing to watch. It really helps them quiet down when they are fussy. I completely recommend it!,1035504000,4,144,4.37037037037037
1776632,5,B00006II6I,"My children LOVE this video. They cannot watch it enough. They want to see it first thing in the morning, which gives me time to get everyone ready. It's very cute to watch them sing and dance along.",1035504000,3,199,4.2631578947368425
1776633,5,B00006II6I,"I purchased this DVD for my best friend who is adopting twins because I know she will have her hands full and will need entertainment for 2 busy babies.  I viewed the DVD to see how I liked it and to my suprise my 5 year old daughter was riveted and mesmerized by the show.  She absolutely loved the singing babies, the music, costumes and colorful backgrounds.  When I tried to speak she said ""be quiet"" and wanted no interuptions or distractions while viewing, my nine year old son was even smiling and singing along.  For these reasons I give the DVD 5 stars because it entertains such a large age span while teaching kids the classic songs that we all grew up with.",1035504000,2,669,4.370967741935484
1776634,5,B00006II6I,"THIS VIDEO IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY FAMILY...THE AGE OF THE CHILD (KID OR ADULT) DOES NOT MATTER...EVERYONE WILL ENJOY IT!  My kids, ages 3 and 5, have grown up watching the first Singing Babies video, ""Nursery Rhyme Time.""  I am sooooo glad that the company has now made a second video/DVD/CD, ""Toddler Tunes.""  Even though my kids are older, they still LOVE watching the babies sing, the colorful backgrounds and the great music.  Also, the special effects are even better on this video.  The song selections on ""Toddler Tunes"" are perfect for kids this age.  My kids prance around to ""Yankee Doodle,"" follow the game in ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes,"" and sing along to all the songs (they're favorite is ""Bingo"").  Now, they want a real dog named ""Bingo"" -- what a mother will do for her kids.",1035417600,2,798,4.6571428571428575
1776635,5,B00006II6I,"As a new dad, I can't tell you how hard it is to understand what your baby wants when he cries.  Last night, it was my turn to stay with our 5 mo. old son, while my wife went out with her girlfriends.  I thought I could handle it, but panicked when my son began wailing incessantly.  I tried changing him, rocking him, even singing to him. Nothing was working, so I put on SINGING BABIES TODDLER TUNES, a tape my wife bought.  The second, and I mean the second, this thing began playing, my son quieted down and just stared at the screen with his jaw slightly open.  He looked over at me and back at the screen, as if actually amazed.  I couldn't believe it.  He watched a while, then a smile creeped over his face.  He went on to bounce and giggle to what is now this Dad's new best friend.",1035417600,2,791,4.090909090909091
1776636,1,B00006II6I,"My husband and I were looking forward to the release of this video with great anticipation...our son liked the first tape, so we ordered this one the day it was released.....The very first ""Yankee Doodle"", featured an overt nationalist theme, but, not too extreme, HOWEVER, the ""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" contained a strong military theme featuring a baby dressed as a sergeant barking out orders....We all know how impressionable young kids are, and how OFTEN they will watch a beloved tape.....If this is a reaction to September 11, it is highly inappropriate, war and terrorism should be kept in the world of adults....",1035158400,2,629,5.0576923076923075
1776637,3,B00006II6I,"Ok, so this is a creepy and very poor quality dvd, but my toddler loves it anyway. She gets in our van and says ""babies...."" over and over. The one thing that really bugs me (besides the awful singing) is that for many of the songs they actually get the song lyrics entirely wrong. I'm not sure if this is intentional, or just laziness on the part of the people who created it. You'd think, however, they would check the song lyrics before recording the songs. I'm not sure I want my kid singing the song lyrics wrong when they reach school age. For example, for Oh Little Playmate, they say ""bring your dollies, please"" instead of ""bring your dollies-- three"" and ""slide down my rainbow"" instead of ""slide down my rain barrel."" This is consistent throughout-- Clementine has all the lyrics changed, as do many other songs. As people said, the animations and/or backgrounds are really low quality. With all this said, if you can tolerate some really horrible singing, and aren't freaked out by the baby mouths being adults (kinda like the Fidelity Investments commercials with the baby talking and investing) your kid will either hate it and be terrified, or LOVE IT. If you're thinking about buying-- buy used so you don't feel bad if your kid hates it.",1454284800,,1254,4.653153153153153
1776638,1,B00006II6I,"This was so scary to watch! ""babies"" are singing with grandma voices and their mouths are so crooked and fake that it looked like all those babies had some serious birth defects I don't want to be mean but obviously the video is so badly done that you feel bad for those babies that I am sure are super cute in real life. Great idea but awfully done and scary to watch. I seriously regret this purchase and will never recommend it to any parents!",1449705600,,446,4.258823529411765

1776641,5,B00006II6I,My son will give this video 5  stars. I will give it  . I think its the ugliest video. But my toddler really enjoys it. He asks to watch it daily.,1434240000,,146,3.6774193548387095
1776642,1,B00006II6I,"Kids just stared at the weird babies  with huge mouth teeth superimposed  over the  faces. Kind of ""creepy"" and ""weird  ""  and that was their opinion! Music isn't great either. Sorry I paid so much for it.",1433721600,,205,4.4324324324324325
1776643,4,B00006II6I,"Yep, have to agree with some other viewers.  A little weird but grandson was amused for a little while. lol  Could have chosen better songs.",1433548800,,140,4.56
1776644,3,B00006II6I,Just ok got it for nursery at church. my 13 year old laughed because the mouth of the babies don't match,1422144000,,104,4.0
1776645,1,B00006II6I,"Pretty scary show...lot of people seem to like this, but the fake mouths on the babies was super creepy to me.  My 3 and 4 year olds didn't seem to notice, but nooooooo thank you!",1417824000,,179,4.114285714285714
1776646,1,B00006II6I,Awful awful! The babies are creapy. My grandson hated it.,1414972800,,57,4.8
1776647,1,B00006II6I,Name is misleading. This is not at all what I expected. The children look unreal and kinda scary because it is computer generated motions. Normal children will not sit still and move only their mouth. Maybe better effect if real toddlers were used with real toddler responses to music. My 2 year old instantly realized something was wrong he did not at all enjoy this. Would prefer to not give any stars at all.,1412985600,,411,4.5675675675675675
1776648,4,B00006II6I,"I liked it very much, it was a gift and they baby really doesn't seem to like it or not.  Im sure when he gets older he will love it.",1411430400,,133,3.433333333333333

1776652,1,B00006II6I,it's very bad. voice and picture not clear .It is not worth even a $1. I don't recommend this to any one .,1395878400,,106,3.652173913043478
1776653,1,B00006II6I,"I have no idea how this item received a number of favorable reviews.  I have been looking for a DVD that features traditional children's songs with lyrics.  Seems like this would be an easy find, but not so much!

This DVD features infants and toddlers with their mouths replaced by much older children.  It reminds me of Chucky, the horror movie.  Their voices are horrible.  The graphics, costumes, etc. are totally amateur.  I guess you get what you pay for, right?",1393200000,,468,4.703703703703703
1776654,5,B00006II6I,"I bought this for my toddler to keep him happy in the car and he loves it!  My other two, older children, however, say its creepy but are at the same time absolutely mesmerized by it as well.  I haven't actually had to watch it as I'm alway driving, but if it makes the two year old happy, I'm happy!!  I am also thrilled that I got two DVD's of two separate SInging Babies tunes, one more than expected.",1391126400,2,404,4.0886075949367084
1776655,5,B00006II6I,My 5 month old grandson loves watching the babies and my daughter can't stop laughing at the babies so I guess they are both enjoying the video !!!,1389571200,,147,4.285714285714286
1776656,2,B00006II6I,"When my children were babies and toddlers, they loved the singing babies tapes.  I was VERY disappointed in these.  The babies are now altered to make their mouths 'sing', like the talking/dancing babies on TV commercials.  Whose idea was THAT??!!",1389225600,,247,5.125
1776657,5,B00006II6I,"It keeps my baby intrigued. She tries to sing along at 12 months. She's  always saying ""baby"" to the screen.",1384300800,2,108,4.4
1776658,5,B00006II6I,This is the ONLY DVD my granddaughter truly LOVES! It has saved my sanity on MANY occasions! She is 1 1/2 and had adored it for many months now.,1375315200,2,144,4.0
1776659,5,B00006II6I,"Would give five starts but could use some updating. My great grand daughter just loves it though. She doesn't notice the songs are not current and since they are really for her..then that's fine.

Since she is always on the go she will hear a song and stop what she is doing and start dancing.",1372377600,,293,4.327272727272727
1776660,1,B00006II6I,Just a very strange concept and I have a home daycare and thought the kids would like it but oh no!!,1358812800,,100,3.8095238095238093
1776661,1,B00006II6I,This has grown up mouths superimposed over babies singing.  The singing is poor and the visuals are awful cheaply made and creepy to watch.,1355356800,2,139,4.791666666666667
1776662,3,B00006II6I,The picture quality and the production value was subpar. They copied and pasted adults' mouths over the babies' mouths to simulate the babies singing. It's kind of creepy.,1354492800,,171,5.142857142857143
1776663,1,B00006II6I,"This DVD is the worst DVD ever made!  The babies have large adult mouths superimposed on their faces, and added to that, they're totally out of proportion.  It messes up the expression, which is sure to confuse little spectators, and gives the appearance of oddly deformed creatures who never smile while they're singing.  It looks like something out of Tim Burton's work.  Whatever you do, DO NOT waste your money on this horrible DVD.",1333843200,2,436,4.851351351351352
1776664,5,B00006II6I,"My grandson, his grammie, and his paux paux love this dvd.  His parents thought the mouths on the babies were creepy, but they now agree that their son does like.  It's really helped all of us learn the songs and it's fun to sing them together.",1317945600,,244,4.282608695652174
1776665,5,B00006II6I,"Was looking for something to entertain my 21 month old son. This was it. He especially liked Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes. I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it, but am very pleased.",1314576000,,194,4.416666666666667
1776666,1,B00006II6I,"I bought this product regardless of reading the reviews that the graphics are horrible with superimposed adolescent mouths on babies. But I went with the idea that my baby is more listening to the music and watching other babies than actually paying attention to the mouths of the babies. That may still be the case, but this video scared my child. She won't watch it without breaking into tears every single time! I'm not sure if it is the graphics, but they sure scared me! Don't waste your money on this - get Sesame Street, Baby Einstein, or any other music DVD...just not this one!",1308441600,2,586,4.59047619047619
1776667,4,B00006II6I,"Yes, I laughed until I almost cried the first time I watched this DVD.  It is wierd the way the mouths are superimposed over the babies actual mouth, but it is ridiculously funny!  And my 17 month old granddaughter loves this DVD over all others.  She is fascinated by the characters, and watches the whole thing from start to finish.  The songs are all old-fashioned and innocent classics. Don't worry about the creepiness and the cheesy props - your baby or toddler won't notice, and will most likely love the DVD.",1297728000,,516,4.637362637362638
1776668,5,B00006II6I,My 2 year old learned to sing watching these videos. She just loves when she can sing with other babies! I highly recommend these if you and your child love to sing!!,1292716800,,166,4.21875
1776669,1,B00006II6I,"Who in their right mind will play video tricks with a baby's mouth...?  This cheap DVD does it.  Adults mouth movement is super imposed on baby's mouth to create an impression of baby singing rhymes.

The result is a rather disgusting video that looks devilish.  I can't believe so many people would have enjoyed this and given 5 star rating.",1282867200,,342,4.65
1776670,5,B00006II6I,"Ok so here's the deal... If you are above the age of 5, you might find these dvds to be a little under par and the source of many an eyebrow raised. BUT, if you're 5 or under, you wil LOVE them! When my son first started watching these, my mom and I sat there critiqueing everything. ""Poor graphics"", ""that kid's mouth doesn't go w/ that baby's face"", etc. But then we noticed how entranced he was. That was months ago and he's STILL entranced while approaching age 2. Nothing else holds his attention the way these do! In fact, they were our saving grace on a long trip! Get them--for the price, what do you have to lose?!",1279324800,,623,4.243697478991597
1776671,5,B00006II6I,"I know the adult lips imposed on the babies may freak out adults but, we have 11 grandkids and they love these to pieces!  I am soooo glad I made the small investment.  Our one year old will sit right down and never move thru the entire thing and the three and four year olds sing right along.
I'm not one to put kids in front of the TV but, sometimes a gal has to make dinner or something and slipping one in to keep the baby out of trouble is marvelous!  These seem to be the little one's favorite!",1278547200,,500,3.98
1776672,1,B00006II6I,"Pretty confused as to why people gave this good reviews. Seriously, don't waste your money on this. It is uninteresting and of really poor production value. Instead of children singing, it is adults with really bad voices pretending to be children with their mouths superimposed on the babies. To top it off, their versions of the popular songs are pretty poor..It did not engage my child whatsoever and was more than annoying to me.",1278460800,,433,4.864864864864865
1776673,5,B00006II6I,"The guy that I dealt with sent the wrong singing babies, honest mistake, and he said we could keep both.  Really nice guy.",1277424000,,122,4.304347826086956
1776674,5,B00006II6I,"Yes, I must admit that the first few times I watched Singing Babies and Singing Toddlers it really creeped me out.  But this DVD isn't geared towards adults, it is geared towards toddlers and babies!  My 14 month son LOVES this series.  He will hit the TV and yell ""ba-ba"" for his babies.  I would definitely recommend this.",1266796800,,324,4.5344827586206895
1776675,5,B00006II6I,"My father in law bought singing babies and our son won't watch anything else.  Yes, it's strange to watch at first and the graphis aren't what we are used to these days, but it is great stuff for the kids.  Babies love to watch other babies, they love the bright colors, they love the stuffed animals and love the music.  Our son picks this over Elmo, Baby Einstein and everything else we have.  For the price, it is worth a try and let your little one decide if he/she likes it or not.  Heck, my husband and I usually find ourselves singing the songs throughout the day!  I think this is a great product at a great price.  I wish there were more!",1266105600,,647,4.211382113821138
1776676,5,B00006II6I,"Yes, as some negative reviews mention, this is a really weird DVD. My husband and I hated it for a long time. But as we saw how glued to the movie our 3 kids were to it, we began to really like it. It reminds me of that old cartoon with mouths for the characters. Anyhow, it's funny and the kids love it so that's enough for 5 stars for me!",1258329600,,340,3.8028169014084505
1776677,2,B00006II6I,"I don't know what I thought this video would be, but it's pretty cheesy. The babies move very little except for the superimposed lips on their faces. Even though the songs and costumes change, the video became boring very quickly for my two year old granddaughter, and she left the room.",1254268800,,287,4.647058823529412
1776678,1,B00006II6I,The worst one i can say.the babies lips are graphics with some others and looks very ugly and bad......dont waste the money to buy this......Not even worth for a doller too.....,1247961600,,177,4.741935483870968
1776679,1,B00006II6I,"I bought this DVD based on the large number of good reviews and was incredibly disappointed.  This is the WORST children's DVD that I've ever seen.  It's a montage of children sitting in various scenes.  The voices are from adults trying to sing like children; but, they don't sound like children at all.  They sound horrible.  Equally bad, perhaps even worse, are the graphics.  They superimposed adult mouths, big adult teeth and all, on the children's faces.  My 22 month old didn't like it either.  He looked at the strange children's faces with adult teeth and unnatural movements with a perplexed look on his face.  This is a very WEIRD and CREEPY DVD!  Don't buy it!",1232928000,6,673,4.724137931034483
1776680,1,B00006II6I,We bought this CD since there are a lot of good reviews.  They are misleading.  This is the worst children CD/DVD we have ever heard/seen.  Adults try to sing as children.  They didn't sound like children at all and they sound horrible. The graphics are really bad. They superimposed adult mouths on baby face.  THEY ARE CREEPY!,1230249600,9,328,4.684210526315789
1776681,1,B00006II6I,"This set is way too weird.  I knew what I was getting into by reading other reviews here on Amazon, but I thought it might be funny for us as parents.  It really isn't.  We've only been able to get through it once and it left us confused and ashamed for wasting money.  While it was on, my 15 month old looked puzzled, then simply walked out of the room after two songs.  If it had been a hit, she would have danced her little rear end off!  Its just bad, folks. The fake mouths on the babies have full sets of teeth, the voices are bad adult falsettos, and the graphics are terrible.  Plus, there's a weird patriotic / military vibe that is ultra creepy.  I'll even go so far as to say the babies could be cuter, too!!  But on a positive note, I could see this being a cult classic college students of for the after hours club scene.  People on drugs would dig it.",1226966400,4,865,4.095238095238095
1776682,4,B00006II6I,"When we popped in the DVD, it was a little shocking to see babies (maybe 6-9 mo. old) singing songs with their mouths moving like adults!  My daughter loves it, and requests Humpty Dumpty and Frera Jaques (?) over and over again.  If you can get over seeing these babies talk with adult mouths, it's a good dvd with a large variety of songs.",1208563200,,341,4.3125
1776683,5,B00006II6I,"Our 1 y/o loves to dance and sing along with this video! I'm always impressed when I can find something that sticks to the original lyrics. I won't lie, it's a bit creepy, but also grows on you. A forewarning- if you have a large plasma or other big screen TV it does look pretty grainy- all in all though good value for the money and will have you singing right along with your children!",1203724800,,388,4.1866666666666665
1776684,5,B00006II6I,"When it comes to baby videos, I have had my fill.  However, ""Singing Babies Toddler Tunes"" has really good music that is so well produced that I can listen to it over and over and maintain my sanity.  My daughter never tires of watching the babies singing the nursery rhymes.  We both love the song selection.  It's like MTV for babies.  The bonus features on this disc include karaoke, where I can sing with just the music for my daughter.  She enjoys this.  It also has a feature for children learning to recognize words on the screen.  This is a bit advanced for my daughter, but maybe in a couple of years she will benefit from this.  Overall, I am very happy with this purchase.",1150761600,11,683,4.4
1776685,5,B00006II6I,"This DVD has cute babies in costumes, fun music, and my eight month old's heart.  He loves this one.  As Randy Jackson would say on American Idol, ""We Got A Hot One Here!""  Paula would love it, since it gets babies dancing, and Simon would praise the fact that it is original.  With all the other baby videos seeming like ""me too"" products, Singing Babies delivers just that...babies that sing with really convincing special effects.  My son loves this DVD and crawls for it to pluck it off the shelf.  So again I say, ""We Got A Hot One Here!""",1150761600,12,543,4.38
1776686,5,B00006II6I,"My five-month-old, two-year-old, and three-year-old all love Singing Babies Toddler Tunes.  They can watch it together and sing along.  My youngest smiles and bounces around to it as my older children sing and dance to it.  What a great find!  The CD is with us on every car ride, and the tantrums are quickly mitigated with a quick dose of Singing Babies.  It really works.  I give this DVD my highest recommendation.  Get it!  You will thank me later.",1150761600,17,453,4.6455696202531644
1776687,5,B00006II6I,"This DVD has captured the mind and spirit of my 8 mo. old boy, Duncan.  He lights up like a Christmas tree every time I turn on the DVD.  It makes his day.  The tunes are all familiar and bring back memories of when I was a kid.  The DVD has babies singing onscreen with special effects that are quite real.  My baby thinks the babies are singing to him.  He is so fascinated, joyful and active every time the DVD plays.  I highly recommend this DVD over many of the other music DVDs for children.",1150675200,14,497,4.114583333333333

""Singing Babies Toddler Tunes"" incredibly keeps him focused and reactive in a way that we rarely see with him.  We now have another copy of this DVD at the school that he attends.  This DVD has made a signifcant impact on our lives and is just a wonderful product.  A+++",1150675200,20,442,4.602564102564102
1776689,5,B00006II6I,"My daughter, 15 months, LOOOOOVES this DVD.  She can watch it for several viewings in one sitting.  We don't have any other DVD that gets this kind of undivided attention.  The songs are quite good and the renditions of ""Humpty Dumpty"" and ""Clementine"" are particular favorites.  Very clever visuals.

I thought that the initial infatuation with the DVD would pass, but we are on week six and still no sign of disinterest from my little video critic.  That's why I give ""Singing Babies"" a big thumbs up!",1150675200,12,503,4.724137931034483

Nice music and very cute costumes.  If my baby is any indication, this DVD is a must have!",1139184000,18,265,3.8333333333333335
1776691,5,B00006II6I,This DVD entertains my fourteen month old like no other.  He watches it every day in the morning and afternoon.  He cannot get enough and will not allow me to rotate in new DVDs.  It is really something.  My husband and I really just enjoy seeing him come alive while watching.  Excellent songs and great renditions.,1137628800,13,316,4.571428571428571
1776692,5,B00006II6I,"Got this as a gift, and was surprised how really good it is.  My little girl, eight months, loves the show and looks forward to it every day.

1776693,5,B00006II6I,"Not to sound sexist, but I rarely trust my husband's taste in DVDs for little Cade, our two year old, after he brought home Star Wars.  No offense to Star Wars, but my son is nowhere near ready for that.  However, my husband did bring home Singing Babies Toddler Tunes, and what a great purchase this turns out to be.  Cade looooooves it!  The babies onscreen occupy his very being and delight him for as long as I leave the DVD running.  The Auto Repeat function is wonderful.  The DVD comes with the CD soundtrack that I play now while running errands with Cade.  Now, my husband is back on track with what two year olds should be watching.  Pheewww!",1137628800,27,652,4.375

The best of the best are really ""Singing Babies"" (both Nursery Rhyme Time and Toddler Tunes) and Baby Mozart.  Every other video fails to hold all the babies interest all the way through.  The Singing Babies definitely connects with its intended audience in a way that really I have never seen before.  I recommend this product wholeheartedly.",1137628800,10,518,4.7

She has never shown any interest in other videos that I have shown her.  My husband and I think that it is the baby faces and the singing that keeps her focused.  We show this DVD to her all the time now.  I've even recommended the DVD to her day care center because of the impressive effect it has had on my daughter.",1135296000,6,438,3.8876404494382024

She sings along and, quite simply, cannot get enough.  We have the other ""Singing Babies"" DVD now and hope that there are more to come.  The babies singing is something original in a time when it seems nothing is.  The costumes on the babies are precious and the musical arrangements are wonderful!

Nothing captures his heart and his mind like the adorable babies singing all the great nursery rhymes.  What's even better is that my child tries to sing with the other babies on the DVD.  This is very impressive and something that I am going to recommend to my neighbor who works as a pediatric development specialist.  No other DVDs have gotten my baby to vocalize more than ""Singing Babies.""  Hey, if you're casting for the next ""Singing Babies,""  I got a singing baby right here!",1128902400,4,563,4.752577319587629

I actually recommend the songs on ""SINGING BABIES NURSERY RHYME TIME"" over this one, but if you are like me, you'll want both.  This DVD has some hard to find songs like ""My Little Playmate"" and ""Over The River and Tbrough The Woods.""  Also, there is a great, heartwarming rendition of ""Clementine"" with cute images.",1127088000,4,435,4.76

She has not really focused on other developmental videos like Baby Einstein yet, but when the Singing Babies are on, it's hypnotic.  I suspect that some of the claims on the packaging may be true.  Melissa does watch the babies mouths.  At times, she claps and screams excitedly.  I see the way her eyes light up when the DVD comes on and feel good about how happy it makes her.  This DVD is her favorite and a fantastic addition to our baby DVDs.",1127088000,5,532,4.27

Little Drew can watch the babies singing until I finally turn off the DVD.  He is more animated while watching than with other videos, and believe me I have them ALL!!!  Since I have a home office, I need to carve out several hours a day to get things done and still entertain Drew.  This DVD definitely comes through for me on a daily basis.  We even have the other ""Singing Babies"" just for variety.  If you need a DVD that will truly connect with your baby, it's ""Singing Babies"" hands down.",1127088000,5,611,4.307017543859649

So, the other day he started babbling at the babies on television like he's having a conversation with them.  My husband thinks he's trying to sing.  It is really something to see.

Yesterday, I tried introducing him to some DVDs that I received as a gift from my parents.  One of them, ""Singing Babies Toddler Tunes"" changed my life.  My boy went from wailing his head off to sitting quietly and attentively in front of the television.  We're talking breakthrough here.  Mommy actually was able to take a shower and pay several bills before this state of utter bliss came to an end.  He sat through it for two viewings before it was time to head out of the house to run some errands.

Okay, maybe Mom needs to cut back, but she just loves the video so much that it's hard to deny her.  She clearly identifies with the adorable babies onscreen and attempts to sing with the program.  I cannot believe the amount of use that we are getting from this one DVD.  Literally, it's more than all our others put together.  Our morning ritual begins with breakfast and my daughter crawling over to the DVD collection to pick out what she wants to watch.  It's invariably SINGING BABIES.  I don't think I can say anything more to recommend this DVD.  She looooooves it.",1107388800,3,708,4.6

They are very fun and different from any other dvd I have purchased.  She giggles, dances and waves when either one of the dvd's are playing.  She loves watching other children, so this is a big hit.  My husband and I also find it entertaining, especially the outakes.

Just because you CAN do something with special effects, doensn't mean you SHOULD.  Super-imposing adult's mouths on babies dressed up like adults in costumes, singing (bad music too) is just plain strange, un-natural and bad.
There is no developmental value in this tape.  There is no entertaining value in it either.  Please save your self the time, money and frustration and don't bother with this one.
I am sorry we bought the tape.  I am also astounded at all the ""great"" reviews it got.  I suspect they are bogus.",1065052800,,628,4.621621621621622

These types of dvds are hard to come by and my kids adore them so I gave it a shot. I don't understand how this DVD got 4 stars and such good reviews. This has to be the most disturbing dvd I have ever seen. The babies have their mouths ""made over"" with bigger kids mouths.  It is the strangest thing I have ever seen and it is not cute and the at all.  The vocals are painful, and those are done by adults/young adults trying to sound like much younger children...tone deaf younger children... so the whole thing is confusing and odd.  Forget the graphics, kids do not know any better, but ouch. I couldn't even sing along with my kids when we 1st put it on. I just sat and watched this with my mouth open Iike a dope....I was that dumbfounded. My kids even looked at me confused. They are 2, 3, and 4....and the 4 year old asked me if ""this was ok?"" (Referring to the scary babies)  And my 2 year old left the room crying. Save your $. There are better dvds out there and less expensive. I bought another dvd on amazon called Toddler Tunes, a teacup and saucer cartoon on the cover. Still super cheesy, but waaaayyyyy better then this one.
