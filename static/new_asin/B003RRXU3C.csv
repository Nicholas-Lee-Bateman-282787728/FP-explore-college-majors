4185746,5,B003RRXU3C,Haven't purchased this yet because it is not out in the USA format. I had hoped that now Season Three was on BBC America they would release Season Two. This show is just awesome and I have done my best to turn others on to it. I may have to purchase another copy of Season One because I don't think I'll ever get it back from my father.,1334102400,3,336,3.9558823529411766
4185747,5,B003RRXU3C,"Thank goodness England's Whitechapel district is infamous for its many heinous crimes. Else how could a show initially tailored around Jack the Ripper go on, let alone thrive? There's gratifying news of a Series 3 being worked on and scheduled for a 2012 airing, so sighs of relief, sighs of relief. Meantime, WHITECHAPEL Series 2 revives one of the most notorious eras in East End lore: the reign of the murderous Kray twins, them nattily-attired crime lords what often resorted to torture and murder. And here you thought Britain in the 1960s was only known for the Beatles.

The brilliant cast of actors reprises them roles. Series 2 opens with the East End's homicide unit attending a policeman banquet and still soaking in the humiliation of having allowed the Jack the Ripper copy cat to scarper. Except that it's worth it to hear Detective Sergeant Ray Miles (Phil Davis), ornery as ever and up for a commendation, deliver a scathing acceptance speech. We also learn that his ostracized DI, Joseph Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones), is still on a career fast track. Chandler is covertly promised the next big case.

A gristly corpse surfaces, and it doesn't take a forensics expert to note them marks of a savage mutilation. More killings and further evidence point toward a horrifying conclusion, and uninvited local historian Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton)'s opinion is merely icing on the cake: Someone is replicating the notorious Kray murders. And for our three core characters, pursuit of this investigation would lead down very dark roads. While Jack the Ripper's atrocities originated from the more distant Victorian period, the Krays and their fearmongering Federation of Crime are near enough to now that they're practically breathing down everyone's neck. There are secrets and personal associations unearthed. It's a bit jarring to see the no-nonsense DS Miles rendered all panicky and the normally enthused Edward Buchan so cowed by the unfolding turn of events. As the detectives come to learn, the Federation of Crime is alive and well, its warped influence still corrupting the East End. And if their syndicate yet lurks, what of the Krays?

This is what's known as stepping it up. There's historical attention to detail and great texture. There's a rich atmosphere, but it's a different sort from the original series. WHITECHAPEL Series 2 is neither as gothic nor as darkly evocative. But it makes up for that with its sense of sweeping paranoia and the climate of terror fostered by the Krays' dark legend. The case penetrates deeper into the investigators' personal lives, impacts more devastatingly. We get a peek inside DI Chandler. We find out that his OCD is more crippling than he'd let on. But we also find out that Chandler and Miles' personal and working relationship, while still touchy, is quietly growing solid as bedrock. The posh and by-the-book DI still isn't quite in the same step as his blue-collar homicide divisioin, but there's respect there now. However, Miles - who looks somewhat like an older, saner Gary Busey - still scoffs at that amateur expert on local murders, Edward Buchan. So soak in that palpable character conflict.

The Krays' influence is insidious and comprehensive. The homicide unit faces threats on their families and betrayal from within. The three episodes are so absorbing. There are twists and turns and gruesome killings and moments in which the menace oozing from the villains is simply palpable. Which makes it all the more rousing when our guys finally begin to turn the tide. I love Chandler's bloody sparring in the gym, this allowing him a moment to engage in asskickery. If you're in the mood for a superior and stylish psychological thriller, see this one. And then keep an eye out for this mismatched team of sleuths' next nasty puzzler in Series 3.

The DVD's bonus material:

- 4 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:07:36 minutes), including an extended boxing scene
- ""Brothers Grim: Iconography of the Krays"" - delving into the facts and mythology of the Kray Twins (00:07:23 minutes long)

4185769,5,B003RRXU3C,I love this show it is loaded with interesting characters and great plot twists. It shows the hero to be human and fallible but he is also gritty and real. I own all four seasons because I enjoy watching the show that much.,1495324800,,223,4.209302325581396

4185771,5,B003RRXU3C,"The second season of ""Whitechapel"" continues this decidedly dark and stylish British detective drama from BBC America, with its depiction of a notorious East London organized crime family that has been terrorizing Whitechapel with mayhem and murder. As is the case with most BBC America programming, ""Whitechapel"" is intelligent, intriguing, and suspenseful. The writing, the sets, and the acting are all superb. In addition, the complicated relationship between the inexperienced command detective, and his hardened veteran investigators, makes for an interesting dynamic for the viewers of this excellent series. ""Whitechapel, Season 2"" is an outstanding BBC America detective procedural, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a strong recommendation.",1491609600,4,760,5.918181818181818
4185772,2,B003RRXU3C,Continuing a dismal Season 1 where repeated failure was the method of operation.  Looked ahead beyond Season 2 Episode 1 and found the series never seemed to improve and discontinued watching,1490486400,,191,5.161290322580645
4185773,4,B003RRXU3C,"Great show, unique. Fantastic performances, especially the two lead detectives (head DI and his sergeant). It's a bit too violent for my tastes, so I knocked it from 5 stars to 4 because I felt a lot of the violence and gruesome scenes were unnecessary. Occasionally the stories got goofy, but were quickly pulled back by a good twist at the end of each episode. The single biggest drawback was the gaping loophole involving the head DI's mental health. CLEARLY he was un-fit for duty - even though he was a good detective - but not once do you see him seeking help for his problem, nor does his staff ever once suggest that he should be seeking help. It was disturbing to watch him un-ravel in episode after episode, and also never find happiness from his loneliness and lack of intimacy. I just feel the writers made him TOO dark.",1488672000,2,832,4.516556291390729

4185789,4,B003RRXU3C,I love murder mysteries and I also love quirky detectives. I got both with this. Honestly it took me a bit to get on board. I started watching episode 1 half way and didn't return to it until a few months later. My first impression was it was a period drama as in 1900s or something; they caught me off guard with the whole references to the ripper. But once I got the premise of the show and how it unfolds I grew to appreciate it. Sadly I got through the season quite quickly after enjoying the episodes and now i've finished all but 1 remaining episode. Can't wait for more.,1486425600,,577,4.207207207207207

4185894,3,B003RRXU3C,"Whitechapel Series 2 opens with a police banquet, where DS Ray Miles (Phil Davis) receives an award for his bravery in the Ripper case. The team led by DI Joseph Chandler (Rupert Penry-Jones) is still in disgrace, however, for allowing the Ripper copycat to get away. Chandler is still assigned to Whitechapel, but hes growing restless with all the mundane cases. His mysterious benefactor, Cmdr. Anderson (Alex Jennings), intimates that Chandler will see some action soon. Sure enough, the mutilated body of an elderly man is found in the Thames. Chandler indentifies him as escaped convict Leonard Lenny Robb. The Ripperologist from last season, Edward Buchan (Steve Pemberton), once again thinks the murder resembles one from the past: That of Frank Mitchell, who, in the 1960s, fell victim to the Kray Twins, Ronnie and Reggie, gangsters who once ruled Londons East End. More murders in the style of the long-dead Kray twins are to come, and Chandler has found a tipster within the criminal underground whose motives are unclear.

This Series originally aired on ITV in 2010. It follows the same format as Series 1, in which an infamous old crime spree is carried out in modern day London by a copycat with an eye for detail. Murders are committed right under the detectives noses. Theyre always a step or two behind. Theyre being used by forces they don't understand. In this case, that includes Cmdr. Anderson, who uses Chandler to fashion himself into a kingmaker of sorts. Chandler is a nice enough guy, but his manner is strangely childlike, and his obsessive compulsive disorder begins to interfere with his police duties. Edward Buchan seems to be thrown in without any purpose. Miles is always nasty to Buchan, because we must have conflict, even if adults would not behave that way. Whitechapel is the kind of show thats suited for playing in the background. The characters are one-dimensional. The writing is lazy. Plot elements are often inexplicable, not to mention absurd, but for the idea that some puppetmaster is pulling strings. Its very light entertainment.",1478217600,,2079,5.026086956521739

4185906,5,B003RRXU3C,"Its always a pleasure to explore the dark, seamy streets of London chasing both the cops and the robbers. Combining past and present, with an historian as the detectives sidekick, adds depth. The universal horrors of corrupt police and the very British grit of social class gridlock are mitigated by sympathetic characters and some good acting.",1477267200,,344,5.160714285714286

The main characters became slightly more likable in season 2, but it is still like watching the keystone cops with gore added.

The scripts are filled with subtleties that add icing to the cake, as it were.  The cast is so excellent and diversified that the show could go on for years without a viewer becoming bored with them.  The plot twist, dealing with historical crimes, is wonderful.  I do fear, however, that it will not be possible to continue to write these wonderful scripts without running out of ideas.  Good luck to the writers.",1476230400,,560,4.606060606060606

4185933,3,B003RRXU3C,"Lots of violent action.  Same pattern as season 1, namely a slew of dead ends until a last-minute denouement that seems to come out of nowhere.  This time they added a whole slew of unnecessary complications to produce more drama, e.g., DI Chandler is obsessive-compulsive and drinks to medicate.  The beginning was interesting, but they seemed to get more and more ""creative"" as the plot went on and it ends up leaving a phony taste in the mouth.",1475280000,,447,4.705128205128205

Dialogue is both believable and spare. The humor among the men in this squad is just understated enough. Funny enough so that we get the sharp point but not overdone or smarmy.
  And the plots are terrific. The Jack the Ripper plot is magnificent. (This killer will mystify us forever.). But let's see how the squad does with a more ordinary crime. So far, the mob plot line is kind of mediocre, after The Soranos, what can a writer do? There's just never been a better written set of characters or plot lines than The Soranos.

4186013,5,B003RRXU3C,"The relationship between DI Chandler and Sergeant Miles is worth watching even if you are not drawn to the gory, supernatural terrors that Chandler and his squad are continually mired in.  This series is not for the squeamish or the superstitious.  One of its most endearing qualities is that all of the people on the squad are people with insecurities, phobias, and personality flaws.  They are not gorgeous vapid people with air brushed bodies and perfect teeth.  They are people you genuinely begin to care about and fervently hope that they solve not only the mystery of deranged killings, but that they also come to terms with their own perceived failings.",1470700800,4,661,4.927927927927928

Adds unique psychological elements focusing on the detectives rather than on the criminals.  Cinematography, lighting, staging are reminiscent of movie set rather than television sets. Employs extremely talented actors not usually seen in major roles. Just enough of the characters' personal issues to keep it interesting, yet not detract from the main plot line.

I watched another British series called Hinterland and had the very same complaint. I suspect the same people were responsible for shooting and editing both series.

The scenes of violence are very graphic and leave a very nasty taste after a while. I binge watched this and you get a bit fed up with all the gore. The notion that masses of murders could take place in modern London without a camped-out press also seemed implausible.
It begs the question of how long you could really be a detective without going insane!

4186298,5,B003RRXU3C,I think Season 2 was the very best of this series. The characters had been introduced enough so the viewer understood some of their quirks and approaches to things. The plots were interesting and certainly not repeats of every other crime show on tv. It is important to watch Season 1 first as the character building that takes place there brings the impact of Season 2 to life. Enjoy!,1463356800,,385,4.594202898550725

The characters are quirky, but evolving, as are the relationships between the detectives and their ""demanding"" boss. The storylines are intriguing and compelling.

4186512,5,B003RRXU3C,"I'll write a single review for all four seasons of this series.  An unusual and quirky crime drama staring Rupert Penry-Jones and Phil Davis it is set in the London area of Whitechapel, scene of the late 19th century serial killer Jack the Ripper.  The two main characters solve crimes with the help of history and forensic science, both of which appear accurate and interesting in and of themselves.  The plots skilfully blend dark drama and humor and the acting is the best of the British art (Phil Davis is one of my favorites!).  My only regret is that a series five was cancelled by ITV.",1461542400,9,592,4.556603773584905

I watched two story lines just incase they left the goofy frame of vintage serial killers  being copied. But even if they did, the writing and directing is heavy handed.

The twists and turns are reminiscent of and truly worthy of the best mystery writers the like of Conan Doyle and Wilkie Collins.  The main characters are imperfect people, and thus so much more believable.  Only problem is that there are only four seasons and they go by so fast.

4186584,2,B003RRXU3C,"Series one of Whitechapel was original, well-acted and well-plotted. Sadly, series two is just awful. First, we get essentially a re-run of the basic plot; another ""copycat"" series of crimes. Ok, well that's not too bad. Where things get bad is the utter disconnect between the developing plot and the characters responses, to the point where everything verges on the absurd. For example (slight spoiler alert), by the second episode, it's clear to the investigating team that (a) they are dealing with very violent people and (b) they themselves are the targets. How do they react? Well, basically, they DONT. They just carry on as if nothing bad could possibly happen (even the seasoned veteran who in episode 1 was trying to avoid getting involved because of the danger). And when bad things happen (in totally cliched ways, I might add), they all look totally surprised, get up, and STILL carry on as if nothing else could happen. Again and again. None of this is even remotely likely or believable, and undermines the entire plausibility of the series. A pity, as many of the actors are very good and are let down by the script and plot.",1451433600,2,1142,4.802030456852792

I know they have a tradition of working unarmed, but this was ridiculous.  How about at least carrying a heavy walking stick.  That is or was a British tradtion too. A walking stick would not be of much use against submachine guns, but would be better than nothing when the thugs get up close & personal. All of that aside, this series continues to be well acted & written.  The organized crime & corruption theme was interesting.  However the solution to the problem would have never sufficed among the criminals against whom I worked, so I thought the ending a little weak.  Maybe powerful British gangsters are a lot different, but I do not think so.  Human nature is human nature.",1420761600,,815,4.6573426573426575

4186619,1,B003RRXU3C,"Season 1 began somewhat promisingly, but, as season 2 progressed, it became clear that this was yet one more Brit cop show employing implausible character development.  The biggest implausibility in this instance being: the 'head cop' - who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Initially, head-cop manages to control his OCD by rubbing balm into his temples several times daily and washing his hands repeatedly.  However, in season 2, his OCD escalates until our 'head-cop' is occasionally unable to function at any level whatsoever without 1) consuming copious quantities of alcohol (even while on duty), or 2) standing frozen in his tracks while turning the lights on and off countless times, which is to say, doing so for as long as it takes.  Given that his colleagues and superior know about head-cop's OCD condition, coupled with the fact that 'head-cop' is invariably incapable of effectively defending himself when attacked on the street by thugs, one simply shakes one's head in bewilderment at the incredulous 'creativity' displayed by the series writers.",1419897600,,1073,5.369047619047619

I did call Amazon about it and also about Justified because they both do it but frankly they don't have a clue.  I was told to call my ISP but I know it isn't the problem.  We have Netflix and have absolutely no problems so it kind of puts a damper on things.  I actually watched the show Whitechapel even with all the starting and stopping since it's so good.

4186847,3,B003RRXU3C,"I started watching this because my wife started Season 1 on her own and wanted to watch Season 2--and she couldn't wait for me to catch up!

I won't go into much detail about the show since I'm sure people have already summarized it in all sorts of ways. Whitechapel is a series set in the East London district of the same name. Its claim to fame is that it was the district where Jack the Ripper did his thing back in the late 1800's. It's a largely poor and working-class neighborhood but despite that, the crimes that the team come across are not your normal fare.

For Season 2, while there is some tie-in to the previous season, it's largely focused on a new case. The main twist with this series is that the crimes usually have a corresponding case or tie-in to a case that occurred sometime in Whitechapel's history. Season 2's case centers on a pair of crime boss brothers that had ruled the streets decades before and appear to be back for more.

I won't spoil the details. The characters are a nice selection of different personalities. There tends to be a standard pairing of (and I'm not British so this may just be a common thread in reality rather than a vehicle for social commentary) a well-educated or middle/upper class lead officer, in this case DI Chandler, with a working-class everyman (or woman) which is filled by DS Miles. There are several other team members but the core team is the DI/DS pairing of Chandler and Miles. Chandler's this up and comer that battles OCD while Miles is a veteran officer whose father was part of a crime syndicate.

The twist is there's a man by the name of Edward Buchan who is a Jack the Ripper researcher that also happened to do a documentary or two on past crimes--something relevant to this season's case. He adds an air of slightly wonky expertise to a team just trying to solve the case with modern methods.

All in all, it's an interesting idea and the characters generally are what you'd expect from a British police drama (as opposed to American dramas that tend to polish everyone to the point where it feels artificial). However, for whatever reason, this season was a bit too campy (to me at least; I've since watched Season 3 which is much better--still haven't caught up with Season 1). There are times when it felt like the characters were just bumbling around. This is my opinion of course but I just felt like if the writers wanted to make it seem just like the team was being outwitted, that's fine...there are ways to do that and still not make it look like the team members were bumbling idiots. But, in this case, it just felt off. I've been through the gamut of British police/crime dramas since Prime Suspect, Cracker, Touching Evil, Morse, Waking the Dead, etc. I have no problem with quirky and the like but this particular season rubbed me the wrong way. Take this with a grain of salt as it may not be the same for you.

I saw this because I don't want to completely discourage you from watching the season if only because it still plays into the entirety of the series. I consider it the weaker of the two seasons I've already seen (S2 and S3). From what my wife thinks, it sounds like S1 was also better. Still, there is character development that shouldn't be missed if you plan on watching the rest of the series.

And, besides, if you're like me and you've devoured just about every Brit crime drama you can find and are looking for more, even at its worse, this series is still worth a watch.",1404172800,,3482,4.474015748031496

The motley crew inherited by the main detective is refreshingly engaging. The story lines are interesting and the acting is superb, all the qualities we've come to expect from BBC. The detectives work on cases in London that have ties to the past in one way or another. If you're a fan of BBC series, you'll recognize several familiar faces (Rupert Penry-Jones of the new ""Persuasion,"" which I highly recommend, and ""Silk"" and ""MI-5"" as well, and Philip Davis, from ""Silk"" and ""Being Human,"" just to name a few).

I only gave this series four stars instead of five because I do get frustrated with too many scenes that are almost completely in the dark. Some darkness for the mood and thrill but, not too much.  At some point, I want to see what is going on.

I thought having one of the lead characters dealing with OCD was great. This gives others who are not afflicted, a little insight into how frustrating this can be and how some people are coping.

The best line that I love is when the second in command of the unit announces a put down to the establishment about the placement of his unit in the back of the room. He had to catch a bus to get back to their table. I loved that one.

There's a copycat killer on the loose again, perhaps two.  The MO harks  back to old crimes, so they have to call on the knowledge of the amateur crime historian, Mr. Pemberton, who adds levity to keep the show from being too grisly.

While there's more gore than I usually will watch, and I'm not sure this season is as cohesive as Season 1, I watch it primarily for the characters, script, and setting.

Why homicide detectives roam the underworld of murder without weapons is pretty lame and why do all these British mystery series need a ""doubting Thomas"" sidekick/superior that get in the way of the investigations and need to criticize the lead detective?  The ending to season 1 was quite disappointing. It was like they didn't know how to complete the story so they just  .....SPOILER ALERT ....  had the unsub commit suicide.

The lead character is not at all interesting and even their attempt to make him OCD falls flat. He bumbles his way through each investigation and doesn't make you care about him one or the other. I give this series 2 and 1/2 stars.",1398470400,,876,4.743421052631579
4186926,5,B003RRXU3C,Whitechapel season one was an interesting story line and the acting was very good.  Season two picks up where it left off and is just as interesting.,1398470400,,149,4.518518518518518
4186927,2,B003RRXU3C,"Following the same general outline of the first season was a bad idea. Makes the concept a bit too hard to swallow. Two copycat cases in one small part of London?

4186933,4,B003RRXU3C,Good chemistry in the crew of this series. Season 2 didn't have quite the tension of Season 1 and the idea of connecting the modern crimes with the old gangsters was not quite as dramatic as Jack the Ripper from Season 1. Although those twins sure were a 10 on the creepy chart!,1398038400,,278,4.264150943396227

4186955,5,B003RRXU3C,"My husband & I love this series.  An OCD DI at the helm of this detective show set in Whitechapel, England.  The cases are copycats of famous British murderers from long ago. Aiding them is a historian that researches the crimes from the past in great detail.",1396396800,,259,4.48936170212766
4186956,4,B003RRXU3C,"I was pulled immediately at the beginning of Season 1 by the story line and the characters; pairing Rupert PJ's, vulnerability and inexperience to Phil Davis, gritty, tough been around the block detective.  I love how the crimes mirror the crimes of the past; I found this to be ingenious.  I thought it was clever how they developed the character of ,Steve Pemberton as the Ripperologist, and, eventually, the expert in other copy cat  crimes recreated; he could have been a one season character, but is incorporated in future seasons.  What I enjoy most about British shows is that the characters seem so much more realistic; they are not glamorized as they are in American television. I'm hooked...I'm a fan.",1396310400,,711,4.9

4186958,4,B003RRXU3C,As with the first season the second season is just as rewarding if a bit more so. The characters have begun to cement their relationships and not only do they care more for each other but I care more for them. The stories are fascinating as well.

4186966,4,B003RRXU3C,"I really like this show!  Believable plots, great character development, and solid acting.  My only reason fro giving it a 4 is the graphic images of the murders.  I realize killing can be very violent and grizzly, but do I really need to see every single detail to get the point?  I feel this show would be even stronger if it left the CSI-type images to CSI.",1395705600,,360,4.3283582089552235
4186967,4,B003RRXU3C,I would give this 5 stars but it is a little too bloody and tends to end the episode with a stunner that doesn't make you want to go to bed. I like it best when I can move onto the next episode and not just before bed. I love it but it is a bit disturbing. I will watch all the episodes. My rating is for the series not an individual episode.,1395705600,2,342,3.6986301369863015
4186968,4,B003RRXU3C,"This is not up to the quality of ""Foyle's War,"" but definitely worth the watch.  Good suspense and drama, but too graphic regarding the murder victim scenes to watch while eating or drinking anything.",1395705600,3,200,4.882352941176471

4186972,5,B003RRXU3C,"I have to admit that most British TV crime series are superior to almost anything we do here in America.  They are full of flawed, complex and totally likable characters.  I almost never guess ""who done it"" as I do with their American counterparts.  Whitechapel was one of my favorites.  Not sure why it lasted only 3 seasons.",1395014400,,326,4.568965517241379

HOWEVER--- one evening I made the plunge, enjoyed every element of this British tv crime series and never looked back. Rupert Penry-Jones (remembered especially as beautiful and very young Dick Hawk-Monitor in Cold Comfort Farm) is remarkable in this layered role.... an OCD toff foil to his grizzled East End detectives. So much awaits you. Enjoy.",1394928000,,500,5.109756097560975

This season 2 follow on of the successful Season 1 Brit-cop mini-series, Whitechapel, again uses the copy cat killer theme to  retell the story of decades past murders being copied in a modern day setting.  Once again an enjoyable and gripping story that had me enthralled from the start.

4186987,5,B003RRXU3C,"This is a dark tale to be sure, but I couldn't stop watching.  Season 2 builds on the first season with further character development.  The Brits have a gift for plot and storytelling.  DI Chandler is such a complex individual with a sense of right and wrong, loyalty, and OCD as his constant companion.

Miles is wonderful because he is a polar opposite of Chandler and throws him a lifeline when necessary.  EdOh well, even as he is ignored by everyone, he is constantly looking for similarities from previous crimes.  He is almost like a code breaker of human behavior.  The other characters float, but these three Chandler, Miles and Ed seem to move the story along.

If you are into a lot of flash/bang type of police procedurals this is not for you.  I have only recently become a fan of English TV series, but they have me hooked.  Yep, they are slower paced than US TV of the same genre, but I am hooked on them.",1394496000,8,920,4.4226190476190474

The other character who is not a policeman at all, is more sharp and able to analyze clues more critically.  I'm hoping as more series continue the chief inspector will learn and be more sharp as he grows in his role.  He did come into the role looking for promotion and not a super investigator.

4187008,5,B003RRXU3C,"As so many of the British crime series, this one outdid itself. Not only are the plots unusual, but the acting is top notch. It seems so many U.S. series have comedy added where it shouldn't be. This one didn't. Gore, but not unnecessarily.",1393113600,,240,4.4772727272727275
4187009,5,B003RRXU3C,Great story lines and history links --Great cast and it does keep me wondering what is coming next and who did it,1392940800,,113,4.181818181818182
4187010,5,B003RRXU3C,Love these shows from Britain. They always have interesting plots and the characters are always amusing or interesting. Story line keeps you guessing.,1392854400,,150,5.565217391304348
4187011,5,B003RRXU3C,"I grew up in England during the 'reign' of the Krays.  Although I was too little to understand most of the details, I think the writing and performances captured well the fear that they spread in the East End.  I highly recommend this series and Season 1 as well.  Haven't yet watched Season 3, but hope they keep them coming!!",1392854400,,327,4.416666666666667
4187012,1,B003RRXU3C,"I watched the 1st season of Whitechapel, about an novice police inspector and his team trying to catch Jack the ripper copy cat killer re enacting ripper's murders in modern day London. The show was entertaining and I enjoyed it, and looked forward to season 2. Season 2 consist of  the same inspector and the same team tracking down A COPY CAT KILLER RE ENACTING MURDERS from the 60's.
De ja vu. I mean  - the first time around it was a good story and a refreshing angle to  the ripper story, but to copy paste the script and just put ""psycho mobsters"" instead of ""psycho ripper fan"" ?
Come on. The BBC can afford paying professional writers, and it's unclear why they chose a script that was written, like another reviewer remarked here, by a 12 yrs old. Clearly the creators of the show are big fans of copy cats and decided to copy cat themselves, only they did it in the most amateur and silly way possible. There's also a huge problem of plausibility. I'm not one of those viewers who will go down to the tiny tiniest detail and claim ""not realistic"" but I do find that when watching a crime drama  you need to feel that, on some level, it's connected to what would actually happen in the real world. Watching a unit of incompetent and scared policeman running away from crazy mobsters terrorizing London is implausible and stupid.  Are they the ONLY people capable of dealing with that threat? I don't think so, and no one in their right mind watching this show will think so.

This show needed a better script. The characters needed spine implant and an emergency crash course of how actual police officers deal with crime ( hint - they are not hiding under tables and if they're shot at - they might want to shoot back)

In short - save yourself some time and skip it. If you'd like a good british police tv show watch ""New Tricks""",1392854400,,1840,4.42603550295858
4187013,3,B003RRXU3C,I was hoping for more from Season 2.  Same great characters but the main case was another copy cat case which began to get tedious.  I hope that Season 3 has a more unique story line.,1392854400,,183,4.055555555555555
4187014,5,B003RRXU3C,I really enjoyed this season.  Went a few places i didn't expect.  Glad i found this show. Can't wait to finish the next season,1392854400,,127,4.25
4187015,5,B003RRXU3C,"Everything and more you would expect White Chapel to be. The settings, acting, is all very excellent.

4187016,4,B003RRXU3C,Good acting and interesting stories. Closed captioning helps to understand the various British accents. Scenery from foreign countries makes it interesting.,1392768000,,156,6.476190476190476

4187021,5,B003RRXU3C,"I've enjoyed all three seasons of Whitechapel. The stories are an interesting blend of historical crime events in London's Whitechapel district as they relate to present-day crimes. While some of the crimes have a ""copy cat"" feeling, the real story is the ability to detect patterns in criminal behavior and uncover its effect on a team of criminal investigators. Edgy & brutal with just the right amount of dark humor.",1392508800,,419,5.0
4187022,5,B003RRXU3C,I recently came across this series and watched all 3 seasons in short order.  Found the stories and characters to be very interesting and well done.,1392508800,,148,4.6923076923076925
4187023,3,B003RRXU3C,"Good subject material but weak characters. The end of season II left you hanging with one of the main characters being killed off, I think. Not worth waiting for another season to find out what happened.",1392422400,,203,4.666666666666667

4187026,3,B003RRXU3C,"I enjoyed the first season with the unique premise of someone recreating the ripper crimes.  However, when the second season start with someone recreating another famous series of crimes I turn off the show.  The disappointment was compounded when the character who was the ripper expert now in the expert on the new crimes.  This is based on the plot that before leading ripper tours he lead tours for other criminals.  WEAK.",1392422400,,426,4.875
4187027,4,B003RRXU3C,"If you llike crime thrillers this will keep you captivated.  The English perspective is quite good and the characters definitely play well with each other.

4187029,5,B003RRXU3C,"Really enjoyed the first series featuring a copy-cat Jack-the-Ripper... this series features copy-cat gangsters... well done as well, although a bit more graphic and violent than the first series.  You really get to know the characters better and I am really enjoying their development.  Such an enjoyable series and quite addictive... watched them all in one long weekend...do yourself a favor and rent this series- you'll be glad you did!",1391990400,,440,5.271428571428571

4187033,3,B003RRXU3C,I truly enjoy mysteries AND character development. This show does a fine job with both.  I lopped off a star (all puns inrended) due to the intense autopsy componenet.  VERY GRAPHIC. I think the show would be just as good without the graphic attributes.,1391990400,,253,4.7272727272727275

4187038,4,B003RRXU3C,This show got to me right away. The Kray story was an intriguing one and the cast has pulled it off really well.,1391558400,,112,3.9130434782608696
4187039,5,B003RRXU3C,"I mean for this to have 4.5 stars but that choice is not offered. You might need to have all the lights on to watch this and invite a friend. All that being said, it is a class A production with great character interaction and compelling stories.",1391558400,,246,4.25531914893617
4187040,5,B003RRXU3C,"i enjoyed the peculiarity of each character and the development of both charcter and evolution of their relationships in addition to the storylines, which otherwise, could be tedious - but the British style of  shows create a depth of character that is both appealing and maintains a high level of interest",1391472000,,306,5.0

4187042,4,B003RRXU3C,"really great series, I got hooked with season 1 and really happy Amazon has the other seasons. American TV needs to take a some lessons from the BBC series.",1391472000,,156,4.413793103448276
4187043,4,B003RRXU3C,Amazon currently streams the first three seasons of this excellent produced British police series. Unfortunately the 4th and final season is not available. The series is based on the premise that modern police can learn from studying cases of the past.,1391472000,,252,5.170731707317073
4187044,4,B003RRXU3C,This is a great new twist on serial killer dramas. Detectives with Scotland Yard use information and lore from historical serial killer events to help them solve modern serial killer murders. The team of detectives is lead by a young and enthusiastic supervisor who is helped along the way by an experienced veteran detective sergeant.  The team is also helped by a historical researcher who ties the m.o. of the present killer to the m.o. of past killers. The actors are extremely good and the chemistry between the actors makes this a great series for fans of this genre.,1391472000,,573,4.787878787878788

If the feelings of how people relate and act with each other under stressful situations, then this series for you!  If you like to see the issues of real hard police work and investigation, this series it for you.  If you want to see a mix of affection, love and caring for others, then this series is for you!  If you have trouble understanding British accents and humor, then it's best you don't watch..sorry.",1391299200,,479,4.359550561797753
4187048,4,B003RRXU3C,The story line in this show is so good I like watching this show. Like how it had to do with old crime stories,1391299200,,110,3.625
4187049,4,B003RRXU3C,"Although my favorite mystery/terror story will probably always be Jack the Ripper (season 1 of Whitechapel), the explanation of the control of the one prominent crime family in Great Britain in the 1960's was very interesting and engaging.  It is almost too hard to believe that the Kray brothers had such a complete hold on the entire country.  This was a very well handled, very interesting story.  I liked the development of the two main detectives as the story moved along.",1391299200,,477,4.864197530864198
4187050,5,B003RRXU3C,The first season characters are back with a few additions. The back stores of each character continue to come out with some surprises. As before the stories are tight and it is a challenge to watch a single episode and not continue immediately to the next.,1391299200,,256,4.586956521739131
4187051,4,B003RRXU3C,"Very dark, but in a good way.  Main character is flawed but that's what makes it interesting.  Will watch season 3.",1391212800,,115,4.428571428571429
4187052,5,B003RRXU3C,Didn't think they could match the intensity of year 1 with Ripper but they did and may have even surpassed it in episode 3.  A great speech in Episode 1 by DA Miles to start this 3 episode season and its just up from there.  highly recommend.,1391212800,,242,4.127659574468085
4187053,5,B003RRXU3C,My only regret is that there are no more seasons as it is not airing any more.  I hope there is something new  along the same lines to replace it.  Any suggestions?,1390953600,,164,4.0625
4187054,5,B003RRXU3C,Excellent series. Enjoyed watching every episode.  Well acted and scripted and quality above average overall. Hope there will be more seasons after Season 3 to watch.,1390953600,,166,5.384615384615385
4187055,5,B003RRXU3C,Whitechapel offers great suspense as well as the progression of the seemingly shallow DI to his truly broken character. A remarkable find and wonderfully different from an unending barrage of awful reality TV.,1390953600,,209,5.363636363636363
4187056,4,B003RRXU3C,I love how past crimes in history are  used as a guide for current crime solving. The chemistry between the characters is good too,1390867200,,130,4.416666666666667

4187059,4,B003RRXU3C,"What a treat to watch a totally flawed fictional character bring such ""every day"" realism to a part. I almost forgot that Perry-Jones wasn't the one with the OCD.",1390867200,,162,4.620689655172414

4187061,5,B003RRXU3C,"One of the best British detective series. Right up there with Murdoch, Vera, and  endeavor. The acting is phenomenal and the story line in each episode keeps you on the edge of your seat. Wonderful. More seasons please.",1390867200,,219,4.7631578947368425
4187062,4,B003RRXU3C,"I enjoy British drama. I feel the director and producer are concerned about the characters, setting, and story line. I find it hard to compare with some of the American series except maybe Longmire.

 Another reason I like British series like this is that not everyone is a ""prettyboy"". People look common and have their differences. Not everyone looks fit and trim like the CSI series

Whitechapel is a dark drama that sucks you into the story because you know people who match the characters and the struggles they go through. Each episode builds on the former so you do not jump into episode 3 and go from there.

If I could, I would mark this 4.5 stars.",1390867200,,657,4.5423728813559325

4187068,4,B003RRXU3C,"As someone who has pretty much given up on American network TV, I love finding these British shows that are little- known in the US. Rupert Penry-Jones was the attraction in this show - although his character is completely different  from Adam Carter, the dashing spy he played in several seasons of MI-5 (called Spooks in the UK). In this show his character Joe Chandler is uptight, awkward with social situations and almost crippled by OCD - but he is a dogged, brilliant detective. Phil Davis (who usually plays villains) is great as the gruff, grumpy  Sergeant who finally starts to value (and protect) his boss. One unique thing this series is the character who was a Jack the Ripper researcher, who has become a police historian - it is interesting to see historical basis of the crimes - everything from The Ripper and The Krays, to the bogeyman. The tone is moody and atmospheric, and although the jerky camera work can sometimes be overdone, this is a really great series.",1390262400,,981,4.730994152046784

4187085,5,B003RRXU3C,"The stories that the the writers put out on this excellent series should receive awards for the actors and the writers and the team that puts everything together. Each character has its own things going on with them and you get pulled in. Especially its a crime thriller/ mystery series which I much enjoy. DI Joseph Chandler with his obsessive cleaning and having all things organized and dealing with his disorder while solving crimes is fantastic to work and the chemistry between him and DS Ray Miles classic bromance.
I recommended to anyone who enjoys this kind of crime/thriller/mystery series to see it. Great! All the other actors and guess actors are also great.",1389139200,,672,4.9035087719298245

They've won a fan!",1389052800,,302,4.357142857142857

Series 1 is set in a district of London called whitechapel. Where the 19th century serial killer, dubbed Jack the ripper roamed.
Series 2 uses the Kray twins as the inspiration. These gangsters were the bad guys that were running things during the swinging 60's.",1389052800,,412,4.9855072463768115

Lots of places in the show I've been to including the ""Blind Beggar"" pub way back when my brother used to frequent that place. This show brings back so many memories and is so realistic...seems a million miles from Dallas where I now reside.

4187108,5,B003RRXU3C,"I've always been a fan of the English detective, no one does the ""who dunnit"" like the Brits. If your a fan of Inspector Lewis and Vera, than this is the series for you. Artfully filmed with strong likeable leading characters and delicious plot twist. And who doesn't love watching Rupert Penry-Jones massage his temples in distress and then mess it up with the local Whitechapel mafia? Season 1 and 2 are a must for all detective lovers.",1388793600,,438,4.628205128205129

4187119,5,B003RRXU3C,"British writers, directors, and producers are superb at getting mystery/crime stories engaging and this series is no exception. Putting a posh gentleman with zero experience in crime solving in the position of DI was brilliant.  It complicates the stories just enough as he gets to know and manage his crusty staff at the same time he is working double time to learn the trade and figure out the good guys and the bad guys.  While there are secondary stories around the personal lives of his staff, so far the series has not degenerated into making them more soap opera than background.",1388534400,,586,4.792079207920792

4187136,5,B003RRXU3C,Whitechapel is an excellent crime drama. I enjoyed the evolution of all the characters and how they became a cohesive unit at the end of the first series. I am truly fascinated by the way police procedure is conducted in the United Kingdom.,1387584000,,240,4.604651162790698

4187141,5,B003RRXU3C,"Season two finds us with yet another copy cat killer on the loose and our obsessive compulsive DI must use his colorful team of investigators to find the killer (or killers).  I love that this show takes old crimes and has the copycat killer recreate them down to the tiniest details!  The development of the relationship between DI Chandler and his Sgt. Miles is perhaps the best thing about the show, but I love everything about it.  Usually with a series there is always that one character that you wish would get killed off because they are so annoying....not with this show.  There's not a single recurring character that I don't like.  This is my new favorite show!  Love it!",1387238400,,681,4.633333333333334
4187142,4,B003RRXU3C,Really enjoyed this crime drama. It has unique elements that sustained my attention. From the lead detective with OCD and a history research that proves himself to the whole squad. But alas it ended way too soon,1387065600,,211,4.72972972972973
4187143,4,B003RRXU3C,The story is a bit spooky. Characters are interesting and work against one another effectively. Photography sets the mood for much of the story. The history element makes it seem more dated than it is. Resolution not quite satisfying.,1387065600,,234,5.0256410256410255

4187146,5,B003RRXU3C,"Great atypical British modern day cop series. Only a few bad guys have guns so there are more stabbings, drug OD's and plain old choking. The cops get along fine without guns mostly. Top cops drive Range Rovers of course and just about the entire cast speaks enough English that can be understood by us poor Yankees. This review is for the entire series currently available to Prime subscribers.",1386979200,,395,4.739130434782608

4187150,5,B003RRXU3C,"Each episode is a unique twist of an iconic murder case. The characters are so fully formed you care for them as you would family. But the lead, Rupert Penry-Smith is so fascinating you can't look away. One either wants to adopt him or bed him, the emotional attachment is so strong. That too is the writer's idea of what a modern man should be, full of strange weakness, compulsive behavior but with an endearing gentle heart. When will you include the 4th series?",1386720000,,465,4.5476190476190474

4187160,5,B003RRXU3C,One of the best series I have seen so far. The lead character is so twitchy and so out there you sometimes feel the same pain he's going through and are thankful that he has someone to help him through the adjustments he has to make while solving crimes and trying to live his life outside of the office.,1385510400,,304,4.169491525423729
4187161,5,B003RRXU3C,"Love it, a good crime/mystery drama without tons of profanity and violence. You can know that someone has been killed in this drama without showing the step by step murder being carried out like american crime dramas. Also , the average american crime drama comes with tons of profanity that is totally unnecessary. This is refreshing, almost like an English  X-Files.",1384819200,,368,5.032786885245901
4187162,5,B003RRXU3C,This series is about modern day law enforcement in Whitechapel.  It combines the history of cases from turn of the century Whitechapel to historic cases from the USA and other lands.  And mostly it is about the people in the LE suad and how they interact with each other.  Well worth watching.  Most cases are in two parts.,1384646400,,323,4.517241379310345

Great character development and interaction all around. Although the crimes are horrific, this is not a slasher series or it would turn me off. The use of music to set the scene, control the pace, and build tension is probably the best I've heard in any other work of this genre. So, Penry-Jones, Phil Davis, great plots, and the music keep me coming back for more.",1383782400,,495,4.636363636363637
4187171,5,B003RRXU3C,This show is superb & excellent as always. Wish there were more episodes this season. Look forward to more seasons.,1383696000,,115,4.8
4187172,5,B003RRXU3C,Interesting characters and story lines.  Wish there were more seasons.  If you like Foyles War or Inspector Lewis you'll like this as well.,1383436800,,139,5.0
4187173,4,B003RRXU3C,Good English crime drama..not as good as Luther but worth a watch. You have an eccentric detective paired with a old time traditional detective.,1383436800,,144,5.041666666666667
4187174,3,B003RRXU3C,"Well acted, but the subjects and the way the series is shot is on the depressing side. Fill Fill Fill Fill",1383091200,,106,4.095238095238095
4187175,4,B003RRXU3C,"I enjoyed the first season of Whitechapel and the story line in the second season is just as engaging, except I enjoyed it even more that the first because over time we get to know the characters much better and begin to understand and care more about them.",1383004800,,257,4.375
4187176,5,B003RRXU3C,"This second season continues to get better.  The character development and the OCD of the lead appears to be leading up to something.  The group continues to work extremely well together, each with their particular expertise, solving all the crimes in the nick of time.",1382745600,,269,4.955555555555556
4187177,5,B003RRXU3C,Very entertaining with enough twists to keep it interesting.  Disappointed there were only three episodes as with Season 1 which was also great.  Free with Prime!,1382659200,,162,5.1923076923076925
4187178,4,B003RRXU3C,Very nice Crime Drama with a lot of Drama. Good story lines and great Characters. Hope it keeps going next year.,1382400000,,112,4.380952380952381
4187179,5,B003RRXU3C,"Very good acting, but the show may be too British for American audiences! The lead actor is in a new excellent show called ""SILK"", again plays an excellent part",1382140800,,160,4.551724137931035
4187180,4,B003RRXU3C,I rarely give 5 stars to anything. 4 stars is a high rating for an exemplary teledrama in the Hercule Poirit tradition mon ami.,1382054400,,127,4.333333333333333
4187181,4,B003RRXU3C,"I chose to watch season 2 after I completed season 1, which I enjoyed.  This is a different way at looking at murder investigations with the police.  Each of the main characters has his own quirks and/or  psychological  problems to deal with.  The tension between Mills and the chief detective is emotional.  Hating each other at the beginning and becoming friends is interesting to watch.  They actually like each other and make sure each is safe.  I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys the mysteries created by BBC.",1382054400,,530,4.811111111111111
4187182,5,B003RRXU3C,Love the use of history to solve modern crimes. It's a nice twist on the whole murder mystery TV show genre. Wish there were more seasons.,1382054400,,138,4.346153846153846

4187186,5,B003RRXU3C,One of the best series (next to Sherlock) on PBS television today!  Superb acting performances from the main characters - the storlines are provocative and scenes are not over-dramatized.  Highly recommend!  Can't wait for Season 4!,1381708800,,232,5.388888888888889

I am not a writer but very much enjoyed the mood

4187189,5,B003RRXU3C,"Season one was so good I didn't think it could get better. As others have written, it is beautifully done - excellent storyline, characters and acting. The episodes are downright scary!  I can't remember when a show was so good I had to be careful not to watch it at night cause it's so scary!",1381536000,,293,4.327272727272727
4187190,5,B003RRXU3C,The story is completely nutty but the world they build has internal logic. The acting is great and the setting is wonderfully atmospheric. Very well done.,1381449600,,154,4.961538461538462
4187191,5,B003RRXU3C,"Especially loved season one with the copy cat murders of Jack the Ripper, very original and suspenseful.  Season two is good, also.",1381104000,,131,4.954545454545454
4187192,5,B003RRXU3C,"Refreshingly different characters, in a mystery ""who done it"" mode with flawed heros bringing past and present themes together. Highly enjoyable!",1381104000,,145,5.9523809523809526
4187193,4,B003RRXU3C,Each episode left us wanting more so we immediately watched the next one and were not disappointed.  Wish there were many more series to watch!!!,1380844800,,145,4.8

4187195,5,B003RRXU3C,"I like the characters in this series, the setting (London) and the plots (although they can be greusom). Still, it is an entertaining crime drama.",1380844800,,146,4.88
4187196,4,B003RRXU3C,Great production....fantastic cast....awesome storytelling!!  I love watching it and highly recommend.  I cannot wait for the next production to view.,1380844800,,150,6.45
4187197,4,B003RRXU3C,"They did a nice job this series fleshing out the characters from series 1.  There was one addition to the team, however, and nothing much was done with him.  Perhaps that will change in series 3?

Good story and nicely paced.  I would recommend Whitechapel.",1380844800,,257,4.644444444444445
4187198,5,B003RRXU3C,"love the series. the british have a unique way to vision drama and thrillers. much much better than in the US.
better acting, and longer episodes. the actors are amazing, and the set , being London is wonderful :)",1380758400,,213,4.487179487179487

4187200,3,B003RRXU3C,"Whitechapel is a well written series that comes into it's own in Season 3.  Season 2 seems like a transition from the sensational Ripper case, with the writers struggling a bit to develop a sustained series.",1380412800,,207,4.75
4187201,5,B003RRXU3C,"This team of detectives provides energy, suspense and humor in every episode. Joe's OCD gets a bit much at times but it is an important aspect of his character. I love the interaction among the detectives on the team.",1380412800,,217,4.589743589743589
4187202,4,B003RRXU3C,Fast paced and lots of twists and turns.  I especially enjoyed Rupert Penry-Jones performance as the slightly neurotic detective.  Different then the usual detective stories.,1380412800,,174,5.92

4187206,4,B003RRXU3C,"I like the entire Whitechapel series.  Thought provoking and I like that it doesn't drag on and on.

The only reason it does not get 5 stars from me is that they have not yet delved into Rupert's OCD.

Solving crimes is not rushed like in US 60 minute format, nor to they drag things out to fill a 22 episode season.",1380067200,,316,4.064516129032258
4187207,5,B003RRXU3C,Maybe a little mystifying for American viewers.  There are class undertones at play here that might be lost - it's not quite as obvious as Downton Abbey.,1379894400,,153,4.666666666666667
4187208,5,B003RRXU3C,I truly enjoyed being able to watch this through my Amazon Prime.  Good show with good characters that keeps you interested.,1379894400,,124,4.904761904761905
4187209,4,B003RRXU3C,"I like the characters -- Rupert Penry-Jones' character's OCD is an integral part of the show -- and the story lines.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first three seasons, and am looking forward to season four.",1379894400,,202,4.771428571428571
4187210,5,B003RRXU3C,Great show! Very cerebral and well written on all levels. Definitely has something for everyone in this show (if you like crime drama),1379808000,,134,4.869565217391305
4187211,5,B003RRXU3C,This attempts to recreate the interest in an historic Whitechapel crime while solving a new one (like Season 1 did with the Ripper) and doesn't really do that very well because the Kray family is not as mysterious.  But as a Ripper fan I was hooked from Season 1 on the characters and as a result I enjoyed watching them again.  This is a quantum leap ahead of the mindless police shows made in the US and I recommend it for those who enjoy thoughtful but not really ponderous drama.,1379808000,,483,4.355555555555555
4187212,5,B003RRXU3C,"I like procedurals. I give all of them a shot, but they've become predictable and I've been trying to find something fresh. Something that I can't predict. A true who-done-it. Whitechapel is that series. I like how one case takes multiple episodes to solve. I appreciate learning about the characters as people. I love how there's a random historian on the team! It's fun. I can be gory. It can be heart breaking. It makes you root for the team of detectives who've come a long way from series 1. It's great entertainment.",1379548800,,522,4.623655913978495
4187213,5,B003RRXU3C,"Yes, I loved this series. So very scary and so well acted. Well worth the hour and half at each sitting.",1379548800,,104,4.0

4187215,5,B003RRXU3C,"Penry-Jones is wonderful once again.  We have to discipline ourselves to not watch this every night, so that we won't see all the episodes too soon.  Lot's of good characterization, drama and just enough suspense.",1379289600,,213,5.057142857142857

4187218,4,B003RRXU3C,"This has a definite twist in the plot that was unexpected.  Usually, I can anticipate what is gong to happen in a series, but this time I didn't expect the changes in relationships within this season.  It was definitely worth watching.  The biggest compliment I can pay a series is that I will watch it again sometime to see if I missed some small clues that were meaningless the first time i watched it.",1379030400,,404,4.4324324324324325
4187219,4,B003RRXU3C,"A bit far-fetched, but hey, it is fiction.  The characters blend so well.  None are so perfect or so unperfect that they fail in their jobs.  The scenes where they show bloodied items of the victims get old though.  Otherwise a very well-done crime show.",1379030400,,254,4.5777777777777775
4187220,5,B003RRXU3C,Well done. Well written. I got addicted and watched the whole series in about two weeks. I highly recommend it.,1379030400,,111,4.6

4187222,5,B003RRXU3C,"The premise that life does repeat itself is an interesting method of solving crimes. It's dark and gritty, yet with feeling for the main characters",1378771200,,147,4.92
4187223,5,B003RRXU3C,"This is another dark mystery series from the BBC but like many of the others is topnotch. Very good actors, plot lines and filming.  Probably best not to watch this series just before you go to bed, as it could give you nightmares, if not keep you awake.  Definitely recommend it to anyone who likes British mysteries done right.",1378512000,,329,4.559322033898305

4187226,5,B003RRXU3C,I love this series.  I love the characters and the story lines.  The series does not dwell too long on the personal lives of each character gives you just enough to know who they are.,1378425600,,183,4.2
4187227,4,B003RRXU3C,Really enjoying TV from other cultures. I liked the characters and thought the actors were good also. Would watch Rupert Penry-Jones in anything.,1378425600,,145,5.3478260869565215

4187235,5,B003RRXU3C,"There is nothing better than an English mystery and this is one of the great ones.  I hope they continue with more episodes in the future.  The relationship between the characters grows with each episode and I can't wait to see what happens next between them and, of course, in solving the horrific crimes.  It's best if you can watch these in order because of the interaction of the characters, but they do stand alone.",1377561600,,420,4.573333333333333

4187242,5,B003RRXU3C,"This is a good as a TV series can be, short of Breaking Bad or The Sopranos. The ensemble of actors is great. You'll recognize Phil Jones from a load of movies he's been in. But as great as is the acting, the writing is just superb. The characters are distinct, real people.",1377129600,,274,4.188679245283019

4187245,4,B003RRXU3C,"Graphic violence yet well done. I finished the first season about Jack the Ripper, then started the 2 Season about mobs and lost interest. A bit too much for me. The actors are very good, the writing is also. Very dark.",1377043200,,219,4.365853658536586

4187260,5,B003RRXU3C,"Somewhat of a ""Criminal Minds"" in the streets of London, the story center around the detectives solving serial murders or violent crimes in Jack the Ripper's old hunting grounds. The character development and the evolution of the relationships between the new and senior detectives are well done. As seems typical with BBC productions, the series consists only of a few episodes. There is one storyline running through the entire season, giving the series a mini-series feel (compared to the one story per episode format of American tv series). Well performed and well written.",1375574400,,577,5.21505376344086

4187269,5,B003RRXU3C,"This season continues with the theme of copycat serial killers but picks the notorious Kray twins and a plot to revive their gang-style power in a new age. There is much I did not know about the Krays and their gang-style hold on areas of London. These are the original Diamond Geezers. The plot is fascinating and complex. The acting is remarkable. The relationship between the inspector and his sergeant continues to develop from the rocky start of season 1. Taut and compellingly filmed it moves rapidly but is a thoughtful drama at the same time. I wondered if the series would be a one-trick pony and where it would go from the Jack the Ripper copycat, but it proves to have the legs of a thoroughbred.",1375056000,,707,4.574803149606299

4187271,5,B003RRXU3C,"I do love both seasons of this series!  It's an fascinating concept and the actors are all top notch.  I have to admit that I was so distracted by the sheer beauty of RP-J's face that it took lots of will-power to follow the storyline in season 1.  They changed his hair in Season 2 to a less complimentary hairstyle and, silly as it sounds, I was grateful.  I managed to tear my eyes away from dear Rupert occasionally and pay attention to the rest of the cast.  Season 2 also brought Chandler a more rounded-out personality.

In all truth, however, if the show weren't so well-presented even Rupert's alarming good looks would not save it.  High production values and good scripts make Whitechapel a white- knuckle ride every time.",1374710400,,733,4.592307692307692

Jack the Ripper is old news, but it was fun watching personalities evolve as the story moved forward.  Season 2 is much better because the Krays were such fascinating personalities and we're getting to see them again.",1374624000,,296,5.145833333333333

4187287,5,B003RRXU3C,Well done. Characters better developed this season. The mood of Whitechapel is chilling with the bleak skies and past and present gruesome murders woven together. Season 3 improves on Season 2.,1373760000,,193,5.258064516129032

4187296,4,B003RRXU3C,Good story line telling the the two heirs of the famous Crays or is it Mccrays family crime syndicate.

4187299,5,B003RRXU3C,The show captivates with its view of a real person with a real personality and real character.  The British are better at this than we are.  We are dominated by the glib appeal to the lowest in our culture.,1372636800,,206,4.256410256410256

I don't realize  how into the show I am till the episode is finished, and I start breathing again.  The main characters play very well off of each other.  The writing and directing is nothing short of brilliant!!",1372464000,,339,4.583333333333333
4187302,5,B003RRXU3C,The acting & atmosphere are 1st rate in this BBC TV series!  It has three of the best English actors around in RUPERT PENRY JONES & PHIL DAVIS!  Not to mention Jones is great to look at!,1372377600,,186,4.0

4187306,4,B003RRXU3C,"I admit, I was hesitant to try Whitechapel, just because the description made it seem like it was treading tired ground--a 21st-Century Ripper copycat, oh no!--but it would be a mistake to miss this clever little series just because someone described it poorly.  The premise?  A grizzled old sergeant and his crew of murder squad are handed over to a ""new boy,"" a squeaky-clean, fresh-scrubbed DI, replete with hand sanitizer, to investigate the murder of a whore.  What at first seems to be one trope after another is somehow given a new twist, with the characters being increasingly interesting and likable.  Over the course of the series, a genuine bond forms between the two coppers, who at first seemed destined to be hopelessly irreconcilable.  Throw into the mix an odd little man who makes his living giving Ripper walking tours and trying to hawk his book on the topic, and you have quite a tossed salad of characters...all curiously engaging.  The first season completes one story arc about the Ripper copycat.

In the 2nd season, a different series of murders occurs, and again, parallels to a much earlier series of murders are found.  The same cast reprises their roles, although a woman is added to the team.

I was quite pleased to read that a fourth season of this perfectly enjoyable series had been ordered for sometime this (2013) year, and I'm hoping it will be out soon.  Whitechapel is very good television, and I wish I could find more Brit-TV series (or for that matter, from any country) as good as this one.  Highly recommended for Police Procedural/Mystery fans.",1372118400,,1589,4.848148148148148
4187307,5,B003RRXU3C,I didn't know how they would follow up the first season - it's hard to top Jack the Ripper after all - but I was not disappointed.  I thought that the second season was possibly even more chilling than the first and the characters improved as you get to know them better.  I can't wait for season 4 to be available.,1371945600,,315,4.147540983606557
4187308,5,B003RRXU3C,"This is a dark show with many twists and turns. The characters are quirky, but believable. The DI has OCD that impacts his life in dramatic ways and DS is a perfect foil for him. I highly recommend it.",1371945600,,201,4.17948717948718
4187309,4,B003RRXU3C,I like seeing Rupert Perry Jones with personality quirks.  It is switch for someone so sophisticated.  The plot is complex and pulls you in.  The guy that plays the researcher is also excellent.,1371772800,,194,4.818181818181818
4187310,4,B003RRXU3C,"The show is goo it keeps you guessing, it has all the dynamics of a great English series. However, it doesn't hold you to the end, it doesn't glue you to the TV, so that why I said very good but not great.",1371686400,,205,3.7906976744186047
4187311,5,B003RRXU3C,Great! I loved every minute of the series. I wish there were more episodes. The series was complicated and very surprizing.,1371513600,,123,4.904761904761905

4187317,2,B003RRXU3C,"Season I has an interesting premise, but in Season 2 it gets old.  Obviously Whitechapel is somehow connected to Jack the Ripper in the cultural mind.  During Season 2 that is not the situation.  The new copy cat is some other past murderer, hence, some of the glamor is lost.  It did not keep my interest.",1370908800,,306,4.410714285714286

I loved the first series but I think in the second, you get a better sense of camaraderie from the team, which is always a huge draw for me. Miles' character has been toned down a bit while still retaining his scrap and vigor, and I love the way Chandler has become even more neurotic. I find his OCD tendencies very endearing and think that Penry-Jones does a great job playing him as insecure, a little reckless, boyish, and a bit messed up by all he sees. Very nicely balanced by Davis who plays Miles as knowing without being cheesy. This is seriously a great show, with a good balance between grisliness and character development.",1368489600,,718,4.446969696969697

I especially the like the actor, Rupert Penry-Jones, from ""MI-5,"" and wanted to see other things he was in.

One tends to equate extreme violence with the USA.  It is refreshing to see just how bloody the Brits can be!! This series is not for the squeamish nor for those who are like - minded.

4187377,4,B003RRXU3C,"My husband and I were already fans of Rupert Penry-Jones from his MI5 (UK's Spooks) days; although that character is a far cry from his DI Chandler character on Whitechapel.  DI Chandler's extreme neuroses were a bit off-putting to me in the first season.  I guess I kept thinking, ""There's NO way this guy would be in this position with his issues.""  By the end of the first season, however, his character had really ""grown on me"" and his intensity in solving the crimes became what I noticed.  Now I find his extreme OCD moments a bit endearing; plus I really like many of the other characters on the show...DS Miles in particular as Chandler's right-hand man.  By the beginning of the 2nd season, DI Chandler has gradually earned the trust and liking of most of his new fellow cops who initially scorned him.

This second season of 3 episodes deals with the head of the Organized Crime Division, DCI Cazenove, and his association with some brutal and gruesome murders.  It appears to be copy cat killings in the style of the long dead Kray twins who terrorized London in the 1960s.  Witnesses tie these current murders to two modern-day twins who are purportedly the offspring of Ronnie Kray, one of the notorious twins in the 60s.  But are they?  These new twins are extremely creepy and no doubt are behind the current atrocities.",1364601600,,1335,4.666666666666667

More importantly, Amazon Instant Video is the MOST BLANTANT PIECE OF BAIT AND SWITCH ADVERSTISING ON THE INTERNET.  When you pay a subscription expecting to see everything - even just everthing in a single series - you are headed for disappointment.  The notion that you can pay a subscription of roughly the same amount as Netflix and still have the surprise that some seasons of a show have extra payments is outrageous.  This is the purest form of on-line gouging ever seen.  Amazon also has a snake in its pocket when it comes to software development and improvement.  The process of finding and selecting videos is not well-thought-out and, consequently is not very efficient.  The streaming, unless it's all the fault of Flash, is badly-implemented as well with jerky motions, clipped words and lip sync problems.  I guess that having a few things that Netflix does not have will allow Instant Viewing to survive but it won't eat Netflix' lunch!",1363824000,,1046,4.937142857142857
4187385,4,B003RRXU3C,"This series provides a double whammy for the lover of crime. First, the team of detectives goes after today''s criminals, as in any contemprary police drama. But secondly, the device of the ""copycat murder"" permits the author to reconstruct the notorious crimes of yesteryear, in this case, the murders committed by the infamous Kray twins in the 1960s.
  This, second, series worked better than the first because the crimes are better documented and less shrouded in gothic mystery than the ""Ripper murders,"" the subject of the first series. Hence the detective-work carried out forty years ago seems more relevant than the confused, late nineteenth century documentation that required an eccentric ""expert"" who distracts not only the policemen but the viewer too. In the second series, the same ""expert"" returns in the role of ""researcher"" that makes him more plausible and, at times at least, barely acceptable to other team members.
  The inspector and his sergeant are an odd couple. The inspector is an upper-class chap with minimal understanding of how folk live in Whitechapel. The sergeant is the opposite: a cockney sparrow with prejudices against the upper classes that, in the first epsiode, seem insurmountable. Then the two become a ""duo""...may be a little too quickly and a little too ""spiritually."" But the two actors carry this off...for the most part.",1363824000,,1369,5.180995475113122

Interesting and intriguing stories filled with unique and interesting characters.  Season two's murder room added a female detective who's got an unusual mother hen kind of vibe.  And the lead detective DI Chandler has taken a page from Mr Monk.,1363478400,,391,4.878787878787879

4187394,5,B003RRXU3C,This show is fantastic. The stories are very well developed and the actors are great. They look like real people with their real quirkiness and not like supermodels.....

4187403,4,B003RRXU3C,Season 2 follows in Season 1's footsteps by offering a new tale filled with interesting twists and characters.

Great show.  Keeps you thinking",1362787200,,479,4.031914893617022

4187414,5,B003RRXU3C,I love this series because it combines detective work with history and has a ghostly/eerie element that adds to the suspense.  The characters are well-drawn and the humor offers relief from tension without being overdone or intrusive.  I want MORE.  Each episode (or sometimes 2-3 episodes) deals with a serial killing but a side character who loves history is always able to relate it to a series of killings from the distant past.  We receive a history lesson along with the drama and mystery of a good crime-solving story.,1361836800,,525,4.865168539325842

Given that it was very much a standalone story, I was surprised to discover that there was a second series (followed by a third and soon-to-be fourth). But any excuse to revisit this premise and these characters was fine by me. At the end of the original series, highly-strung Joe Chandler was permanently paired up with old dog Ray Miles - two complete opposites who nevertheless make an effective team, especially when combined with Edward Buchan, a rather pompous yet enthusiastic history expert who fancies himself an amateur sleuth.

However, since the botched Ripper case, Chandler is feeling inert. He gets no respect from the higher-ups in the police force and is stuck doing menial work in the slums of Whitechapel. At an awards evening, Miles further antagonizes his peers by calling them out on their ""punishment"" of Chandler, who chose to save Miles's life instead of catching the Ripper. The next day a body is found floating in the river, but for some reason the pathologist's report of its injuries results in Miles having a panic attack.

Soon enough the truth comes out: it reminded Miles of a murder back in the 1960s when the infamous Kray brothers, Ronnie and Reggie, ruled over the East End. Buchan is thrilled at this news, as it means that another copycat killer is on the loose - this time recreating the iconic murders committed by the Kray twins. Miles lives in fear of the Kray legacy, as not only was his father involved in the crime syndicate, but he well remembers what the East End was like when the Krays were in charge: they fixed jurors, intimidated police, bribed politicians and cast a net of fear over everyone.

Things quickly go from bad to worse: the hospital has an influx of stab victims who refuse to elaborate on their injuries, one of Chandler's men is attacked as he interviews witnesses, and the team begins to suspect that there is a conspiracy that goes right to the top of the police force. Then shocking news emerges - that Ronnie Kray fathered two twin boys via artificial insemination. No longer dealing with copycat murders, Chandler and Miles find themselves up against an entire crime syndicate, corrupt cops, and two brothers who are determined to carry on their father's legacy.

""Whitechapel"" is high-quality drama, and it's only because the first series was so perfect that the sequel falls just a little bit short. When the characters were dealing with Jack the Ripper, the pacing and suspense was flawless - this was to be expected considering there was a clear sequence of historical murders that were being recreated, giving the police ample time to come up with theories and suspects and counter-attempts to thwart the killer. It was like watching a cat-and-mouse game, with the world's most famous serial killer as the prize.

Here, the Kray twins do not carry the same mystique (living outside Britain, I'd never heard of them before) and the story feels a bit more formulaic. Whereas the facts and legends surrounding Jack the Ripper provided a rich source of inspiration from which to build a story (as well as five definitive murders), the Kray brothers are simultaneously less mysterious, and less iconic. Despite some famous murders, as members of a crime syndicate they could have pulled off any number of killings over the years. To compensate for this, there are a lot of added subplots, such as the truth behind Miles's father and Chandler's struggles with OCD, to the point where the story begins to get a little cluttered.

But this is just nit-picking. The truth is, ""Whitechapel"" is exciting and informative, and it's only in comparison with its first season that it falters - which in itself is high praise. Its real strength lies in the chemistry between its three leads: on the surface, Chandler and Miles and Buchan have absolutely nothing in common. Chandler is an ambitious, neurotic young man, Miles is a by-the-book copper, and self-important Buchan just likes solving a mystery. Most of the time, Miles can't stand Buchan. And yet when they're put together, they make a formidable team. Having a younger man as the senior officer to two much older men makes for an unusual dynamic, and the way in which they bond with each other has rewarding payoff later down the track.

Like the first series, the story is spread out over three episodes, and retains the stylistic inclusion of disconcerting flashes of the past that are interspersed with the contemporary investigation. Though it deals with some grisly subject matter, the gore and violence is never gratuitous, and there are plenty of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. There's also lots of detail and foreshadowing at work that makes subsequent re-watches all the more satisfying. I'm currently halfway through series three, and it's still a sophisticated, immersive, intelligent show, and well worth the effort to get hold of it.",1361059200,18,5458,5.0432372505543235

4187422,4,B003RRXU3C,"I like this series.  The main character is afflicted with a nervous disorder but carries on as DI, must be hard.  It is quite a change from the role the actor played in Spooks - kudos to him.  I liked that the DI cleaned up his squad & that they have kept it up.  All the characters seem pretty believable. The area, Whitechapel, seems gritty and lends a grim backdrop to the drama.",1360972800,,382,4.191780821917808

4187424,5,B003RRXU3C,"I am giving Whitechapel 5 stars because I was hooked after the first episode. The story line is captivating, the characters are interesting and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It was like finding a jewel with all of the shows on television that are not good. The only BBC America show I have ever watched was Primeval, which was also really good.

Seasons 1 and 2 are only 3 episodes long, which I wished there were more episodes. Season 3 has 6 episodes which is much better. It is one of those shows that you want to watch over. It is pretty fast paced and you can easily miss things. I watched the first episode through Amazon Instant Video and ended up watching Season 1, 2 and 3 over one weekend.

The three main characters are brilliant- DI Chandler fighting his inner demons, DS Miles just as stubborn and witty as ever, and the lovable and conspicuous man himself Edward Bunchan!

Absolute boogeymen, that mother criminals tell their kids about. Like the (hopefully) fake Kaizer Sozey. This episode carries the theme on in a great sequel. It's a shame it's the last though.

4187438,5,B003RRXU3C,"I streamed all three episodes, so it looks like the previous complaints about the missing episode and truncated video have been fixed.

Whitechapel grew on me quickly after the first episode. I gave it a shot because Rupert Penry-Jones did such a fine job for several seasons on ""MI5"", exiting the show in a body bag like all the good guys. His DI Chandler in Whitechapel grew before my eyes, from a shallow and ambitious careerist, into a, well, still somewhat flawed and neurotic detective inspector, but a damn good one. There's a strong supporting cast, especially DS Miles and Buchan the ""Ripperologist"", and it all runs on tightly-written and engaging scripts.

There seems to be the usual confusion caused by the British versus American definitions of ""season"" and ""series"". Amazon is showing series 1 and 2 from the first season, and calling them ""seasons"". The BBC thinks they're part of season 1, and they've already broadcast (their) season 2, six episodes in 3 two-part stories (confused yet?), wrapping up in March 2012.

So, I thought the first six episodes were great, and I know there are six more already in the can waiting to air here. Let's get a move on, Amazon! I want more Whitechapel!",1353283200,8,1207,4.821256038647343
4187439,5,B003RRXU3C,Some of the earlier reviews gave the series only a few stars based on the availability at the time of all the episodes.  Not fair in my opinion.  All episodes are now available--at least I was able to see them all. I love this series.  I like the quirky characters and find the true crime history fascinating. I think it is extremely well written and well acted.  There is just enough tension between the characters as they learn to work with each other.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good British mystery.,1352851200,6,530,4.479166666666667

Unfortunately, Whitechapel tries too hard to be visually stylish when the makers should just let the framework, acting and delivery of the stories do the talking. There are way too many flashing, short attention span cuts and annoying visual distractions that seem like a cheap attempt to create excitement and more depth but end up being just plain exasperating. I would much rather see the visual creativity take the form of simple lighting and camera angle techniques that allow the natural pace of the story to take place instead of feeling like I'm about to have an epileptic seizure in a rave club.

8403858,4,B003RRXU3C,"DI Joseph Chandler is played by Rupert Penry-Jones. I have seen in many previous BBC series, like Mi-6, and enjoyed his work. This drama has more thoughtfulness than we see in the American counterparts.

This series is a police drama based on the Jack the Ripper murders. These are copycat Jack Ripper murders, and it takes almost the first episode for DI Chandler to recognize this. It takes a Ripperologist to identify the similarities.  Whitechapel is full of spooky shadows and artful glimpses of gory doings. But, we do not see the blood and gore inherent in the Ripper murders, we hear about them being described.

The characters on Whitechapel drew me in very quickly. We have the street-level detectives with the polished DI Chandler. The quirky Ripper expert brings an expertise to the investigation. It is fun to watch these men clash and then collaborate. The suspense level ratchets up with the pursuit of the Ripper copycat.  Whitechapel is a drama, and the storyline has three hour  episodes. This is a high quality series, you will enjoy.
