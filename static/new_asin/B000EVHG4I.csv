lot of swist and turns but still just an overall good movie.  The movie was also kid friendly, which is rare nowadays.",1369958400,2,237,4.086956521739131

Bill Duke is one of Hollywood's most talented, yet underrated veteran Producers, Directors, Actors, and Story-Tellers.  His talents can be traced back to the 1970's, 80's, and 90's with ""acting creds"" in movies such as ""Car Wash"" ""American Gigolo,"" and ""Predator"" with ""Arnold-The Govenator.""  Throughout the past four decades, his star has continued to shine, which is why I was not surprised, at all, with his successful effort in this great movie.

Howard E. Rollins, Lynn Whitfield, and Richard Lawson hit home runs with their performances.  These veteran actors each made their role come to life, in such a way that I integrated viewing this story into University courses that I've taught, over the years, including ""Women & Minorities in Criminal Justice"" courses.

I particularly enjoyed the ""coming of age"" of Johnnie Mae, as she progressed through her law enforcement career at the local and Federal levels.  Her vulnerabilities and naivete were not lost in this cinematic effort.  The realism of the discriminatory treatment that women endure in Law Enforcement, especially  women of color, is presented masterfully by the beautiful Lynn Whitfield, as directed by Bill Duke.

The late Howard E. Rollins, taken from this life, far too early left his imprint on the character ""T.C."" serving as the street smart veteran FBI Agent teamed to work with Johnnie Mae.  His strong work ethic, was only surpassed by his loyal to his family.  His portrayal of a strong, knowledgeable, and compassionate FBI Agent needs to be replicated in current-day Law Enforcement movies...

Bill Duke was able to draw to the surface superb performances from Rollins and Whitfield, William Young, and Marta Dubois, but Lawson's role was also a show stopper.  Lawson was able to take his character's ""ex-pro athlete"" charm and weave in and out of upwardly mobile social circles that mere street criminals could only dream about... He was perfect in that viewers could really envision his intentions with Johnie Mae, irrespective of his occupation.

I take my hat off to Bill Duke, and the entire cast of this thought-provoking story, because, while working in concert, they were able to take an important subject (Women in Law Enforcement) and the real-life challenges faced by the ""real-life"" Johnnie and make it believable, respectable, and entertaining, without forcing the viewers to feel sorry for the protagonist.

I highly recommend that you grab some popcorn, soda and keep an open-mind, as you watch this great movie... and when it's over, make sure that you appreciate the hard work and sacrifice that women contribute to ""protect and serve"" the masses:-)",1363046400,3,2705,5.212471131639723
