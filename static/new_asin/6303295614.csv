620312,5,6303295614,This is a great DVD your whole family will enjoy.  There is really not a boring minute in it.  Would definitely recommend it along with the Disney's Christmas Sing Along DVD and their new Home on the Range Sing Along DVD.,1094515200,,221,4.365853658536586
620313,5,6303295614,"This Sing-Along is packed with modern favorites from Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladin and Little Mermaid.  We own a good selection of Disney Sing-Along videos, and this one is by far and away everyone's favorite.",1054252800,4,219,4.918918918918919
620314,5,6303295614,"This is a wonderful music video for children, which even adults can enjoy!
Beginning with the stirring and moving `Circle of Life' from the `Lion King', and continuing with
the beautiful and wistful  `Part Of Your World' from `The Little Mermaid', we are treated to lots of fun with the rollicking `Prince Ali' from `Aladdin', `I Just Can't Wait To Be King' from `The Lion King' and one of my personal favourites, `Everyone Want's to Be A Cat' from `the Aristocrats'.
There is also the lovely  `Belle' from `Beauty and The Beast' and the inspiring `When You wish Upon A Star' from `Pinocchio'.
A must for every child's video library.",1053043200,12,633,4.745454545454545
620315,4,6303295614,"Although I do find the 'Aristocat' depiction politically dated,(it immediately caught my attention and could have been edited)The DVD is about songs that are upbeat, full of colorful characters having so much fun singing, that perhaps one can excuse Disney's judgement here. It's a music-filled children's DVD that I don't mind listening to.  And my 11 month old and 3.5 year old love to sing, bop and dance to fun, stylish songs, from a variety of Disney favorites.",1052179200,3,466,4.9743589743589745
620316,5,6303295614,I have a rather energetic child and I have to say this DVD really calms him down. He loves to watch the words. I would definately get this one.,1051833600,,143,3.9655172413793105
620317,5,6303295614,"...Everyone in my house really enjoyed this one, and the fact that the songs were from all sorts of different movies (not just Lion King) was a plus, as far as we were concerned.

620404,4,6303295614,"It's very similar to the VHS Sing-A-Long of the same name. It had extra songs at the end that were maybe from the other Lion King movies or the TV cartoon. The annoying part was that they changed the opening Sing-A-Long theme song, with the music teacher owl and his class, to a version sung by Sebastian from Little Mermaid. I didn't like it.",1495929600,2,343,4.375

Half an hour  is the perfect length.  Having the words printed on the screen helps me remember the words and sing along myself.  Granddaughter loves!  Just as advertised.  Better price than anywhere else.  Love the Prime fast delivery and easy returns (not that this will ever be returned!)

So now my oldest son has a little girl, and I ordered this DVD for my granddaughter, assuming it would be of the same quality as the older tapes.  What a disappointment.  First of all, the songs sound like they are NOT by the original artists from the movies, and do not seem as lively and upbeat as heard in the movies.  Second, the video quality is not good at all.  The pictures are not sharp and the colors not vivid, and do not keep a child's attention (or even adults).  It was so boring, that I just shut it off after the third song, because it was almost painful to watch.  I would not recommend this DVD.  I would suggest getting an old VCR player and find some of the older Sing-a-Long VHS tapes.",1376870400,8,851,4.203703703703703

621146,3,6303295614,"I can see that it is updated to fit a new generation of kids.... But the traditional sing along songs had a cute intro (yes, old animation) with the cute owl professor or Jiminy  Cricket. Which really set the tone for the whole show. But this just gets straight to the songs, I actually thought we were still in previews before I realized the show had started... My kids, 2 and 5, were actually REALLY disappointed and wanted to know why it didn't start ""normal"" when they realized that that was it. I suppose I am just a traditional Disney gal, and really love the intro to the songs and the little commentary provided by the old characters... And my kids like it too.

Everytime I am talking to him (on skype) I can hear the music in the background and he reports that his son loves them.  They keep him occupied and happy for long periods of time.

Also, instead of cartoon transitions between songs, like the others in the series, it is just a narrators voice saying the song title. This breaks up the flow pretty noticeably.",1283299200,,403,4.840579710144928

He's been walking for 2 months & I was hoping to find something that would occupy him for a bit so we could do house chores without him chasing us around or getting into things. He did actually pay more attention to this one than the You Can Fly & Jungle Book Sing alongs. He was really interested in all the animals in the clips. He never really sits still though so I guess it was just wishful thinking that he might sit still for this. I really enjoyed this one the most too.

But upon getting it in the mail for my little one, I was disappointed. The songs weren't those of the original movies. And the DVD only lasts 32 mins TOPS. I know it was a while ago, but I'm pretty sure the VHS version lasted twice as long with twice as many songs. Seems to me like they took one Sing Along Songs movie classics from VHS and split it into 3 DVD movies. Out of the dvd lion king, jungle book, and peter pan- I prefer the Peter pan DVD more, it has much more of the original version of sing along songs to it.

The disney pooh bear sing along is the other i bought and it states that it is 96 minutes long but the dvd says it is only really 36 minutes. So i would not put too much stock in Amazons descriptions on these movies, but they are good movies and they are good at keeping the kids entertained.",1270684800,,623,4.1570247933884295

I bought this dvd thinking all of the songs are from the LION KING movie, not Lion king and other disney movies. whats that about???  I have to either repeat the one song my daughter likes or keep skipping until we get to the next lion king song.  thats not right.  they should tell you either on the description or cover pix that there would be other disney songs included. its not even worth the time and money to return the dvd...so disappointed.

As a French and Spanish teacher, I can say that my students really enjoy this DVD (yeah, high school kids!) and since they already know the songs, they can start to sing along immediately.

The list of songs is not exactly the same in each language, though, and ironically, the French section has MORE songs than the Spanish.  Almost all the songs are there for both languages and they have a completely separate section for them so you can use the ALL PLAY feature and play all the songs through automatically (all in French or all in Spanish) or choose one individual one to use.  I've not been able to find any other Disney sing-alongs like this one with the other two languages (there's a Winnie the Pooh, but it only has a Spanish track).",1197417600,4,892,4.414634146341464
