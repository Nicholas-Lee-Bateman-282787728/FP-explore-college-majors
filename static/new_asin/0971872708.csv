7794426,5,0971872708,"I have the DVD & book by Robert Jones.  I have used them both to learn methods of makeup application and
the use of color to both enhance and down play features.  He  demonstrates methods of application to acheve the
desired results without having an ""overly madeup"" or unnatural look.  All of makeovers in his book, DVD & video are
spectular and all the women look as if their beautiful faces are totally untouched.
  I used his methods when I sold cosmetics, and never had a disappointed client.",1401667200,,497,4.590909090909091
7794427,4,0971872708,"For someone who has understood from a very young age the impact of color cosmetics on a woman's face and self-image, I loved learning about the ""why's"" of color application and facial contouring.  I learned some new things and reinforced some others that I had previously just assumed specifically worked for my face.  Now I can also apply what I've self taught on my canvas to canvases of different shades, shapes, and ages, and I've learned how to maximize every woman's best facial assets!  Robert is great at getting it all across!",1156032000,3,535,4.793478260869565
7794428,1,0971872708,Seems like one long advert for the book. The fast MTV-style editing doesn't allow the viewer to grasp the details in various techniques introduced. Save your money on this one ladies.,1096156800,14,183,4.935483870967742
7794429,5,0971872708,"Robert Jones is remarkable!  Just look at the before and afters and they speak for themselves!!  He does a phenomenal job with every model, who are all Mary Kay ladies by the way!  Get the hardcover book to go with it, and you have the best reference material!",1083110400,10,260,4.375
7794430,4,0971872708,"This short DVD is divided in several wonderful chapters.  Each chapter overviews makeup application techniques for a particular problem area, such as thin lips, hooded eyes, dark circles or bags under the eyes, and scars or birthmarks. A before and after sequence is shown, and a demonstration of makeup application to solve each problem is the bulk of the footage.
I wish there was more detail in each segment, but this is a wonderful ""teaser"" video that every Mary Kay Beauty Consultant should own.  It would be great to have running at exhibit tables, and would even make a nice intro to a glamour class.  You'll also notice that he uses brushes instead of applicators, and demonstrates how to use them.",1072828800,25,706,4.818181818181818
7794431,4,0971872708,"I already owned the video and just had to get the DVD,  it is a great companion to the book with the same title. It was a beautifully presented professional piece. I wish it would have gone into a bit more detailed in some of the areas - then I would have given it 5 stars.",1052265600,11,273,3.875
7794432,4,0971872708,"It is good as a stand alone video, but itis a great companion to the book with the same title. It was a professional piece with a beautiful presentation.  The interview format was nice and asked some good questions. I wish it would have gone into a bit more detailed in areas - then I would have given it 5 stars",1052265600,2,312,4.114754098360656
