6163963,5,B00HHIPPW6,"kari jobe is CONSISTENTLY the best artist for worship/praise. Her voice isn't the absolute best in the business, but she is very good. What sets her apart though, is her song lyrics are phenomenal. always. The music is always good too. Her songs always take my mind off my problems, and put my mind on God. This is where it should be. this is biblical. our focus should be on him, and he will see us through our problems. Staying focused on the problems only sets in frustrations, overwhelming, helplessness, hopelessness, desperation, and depression. Staying focused on god, allows him to work, praise to our savior glorifies him, especially when we are at our weakest. This is what I love about Kari Jobe, this is what i love about this cd, but all her cd's are this way, but i do feel that this cd, is by far her best yet.",1423526400,,825,4.470198675496689
