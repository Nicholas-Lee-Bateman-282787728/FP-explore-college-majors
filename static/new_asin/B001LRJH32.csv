3690860,5,B001LRJH32,"This movie is a laugh riot. It is so funny you will crap your pants laughing, especially when she encounters some odd characters while trying to lose her virginity in one night. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves to laugh. Some of the acting is a little hokey in some parts but the movie is so funny you hardly notice it.",1373155200,2,346,4.338461538461538

3690862,1,B001LRJH32,Great another lame spin off for 40 year old virgin. Don't you think that its getting the wrong message ? A girl can lose her virginity easily and and a man has to suffer more ? That's not the first thing that comes to mind when were born in this world. Those movies are a disgrace. Shame on everyone who wasted money on this!,1330732800,,325,4.09375
3690863,5,B001LRJH32,"A heart-warming movie about what a young woman would do to get the man she loved since she was an innocent little girl.

It all started with a kiss by a Masked Man, a kiss so magic that she never looked at another man at all during her forming years.

Being a woman now, we meet her in the movie when she is 18 years old, and she can no longer contain her love for this man.

We only realize the depth of her love when the man whom she wrongly identified as her future-husband-to-be (two boys were wearing identical masks), rejects her because of her lack of experience.

No one could have foreseen what disastrous chain of events this would lead to.

This highly educational movie, wrapped in humor, innocence and unconditional love, confronts the many obstacles and hurdles the modern young woman are confronted with these days:

1. doing it for the first time
2. alcoholism
3. sadism
4. many-somes
5. not standing up to the occasion
6. blow me away (sorry, I don't want to get moderated here)
7. Buddhism in the bedroom
8. treating of patients in a deep coma
9. how to enjoy shaving -- a taboo subject for woman in many cultures
10. wearing of attachments with style
11. playing for the same team

The only criticism I got against this movie, is the without-adult-supervision-scenes where some children experiment with dangerous fire-works -- I really could not believe that those scenes made it into the final cut. (although I understand that the repetitive screening of these scenes were needed to explain that the problem in Number 5 will only go away if you keep on trying.)

But overall, for teens and adults alike, this is a must have DVD for your collection.",1313884800,3,1668,4.573825503355705
3690864,5,B001LRJH32,"A great coming of age film about a graduating stiff female who goes to a pre graduation party to finally tell the boy she thinks she loves that she loves him. It is her wild girlfriend who convinces her to do this. She kissed a boy in a Halloween costume back in 6th grade and felt sparks but is the typically shy nerd type and could never tell him she loved him. After her female friend keeps getting her drunk and drunker,she goes through a bunch of funny botched attempts to lose her virginity because earlier at the party the boy she thinks she loves told her he doesn't sleep with virgins. Oliva Alaine May the virgin does a great job with her facial expressions and is totally convincing as the straight laced virgin to who things keeping going horribly wrong while trying to lose her virginity. I noticed many bad reviews basically saying the movie wasn't sexy enough. It isn't a sex film,it is a comedy with sex in it. The humour is raunchy but funny. If your looking for a raunchy comedy and not a sex film this is a well acted gem.",1280966400,6,1041,4.343589743589743

3690866,1,B001LRJH32,"WOW so glad I saw this free online. This was garbage. Not even close to American Pie or others. This was ultra low budget. Horribly acted and a script writen by a 13 year old.
Best thing was the main chick showing her breasts. A tad skinny for my taste but oh well.
This sucked and not in a good way.",1237334400,5,300,3.9344262295081966
3690867,4,B001LRJH32,"18 Year Old Virgin, while a low low budget throw away straight to Dvd movie, pleasantly surprised me. The main girl's quest for a bizarre loss of her virginity as a condition pursuant to beginning a more meaningful relationship with a specific proud, decent ( and later we learn Gay) gentleman proves to be outlandish, funny and raunchy to say the least. While some of the sex jokes are degrading though still no more than R rated, the movie's softcare feel is actually engaging in bringing out the film's vibrant if not occasionally warped humor. This is a movie I consider a good recommend. I am giving it 8 1/2 out of 10 stars!",1235433600,10,630,4.535087719298246

(theasylum.cc)
THIS is a very funny movie, Really captures all that teen angst about getting sexed stuff.
  Katie wants to lose her virginity at a senior party and has numerous misadventures in trying.
Very well written and acted, For what it be.
Although cast is unknowns and with a challenging budget, Think they pulled off what well known and heavily financed features fail at.
Lots of crude jokes and ample nudity, Congrats to all bringing back the Old Asylum !",1231718400,22,484,4.75

8319618,2,B001LRJH32,"This is an Asylum film. The title and DVD art work would lead one to believe this is another shallow teen sex comedy. In that regard it doesn't disappoint, except it was light on comedy.

Katy (Olivia Alaina May) for some reason feels she must lose her virginity while at a party. She is coached by her friend Rose (Lauren Walsh) yet has a difficult time finding the right guy, although she is not particular.

This is a rather humorless tale as Katy moves from one bad near-sex scene to the next.

2 stars for the nudity (Lauren Walsh,  Olivia Alaina May, Crystal Baker)",1410480000,,571,4.461538461538462
8319619,2,B001LRJH32,"I got the movie quickly and in great condition, and the price seemed worth the movie... Until I watched it.  The plot was weak, the dialogue was canned, but the acting was good despite the rest.",1395187200,,194,4.388888888888889
8319620,1,B001LRJH32,"This is supposed to be the 'unrated' version. I don't know how tame the rated version must be because in this film the exposure of breasts is all you're going to see... and for the main star that doesn't happen until 50mins into the movie.

Olivia Alaina May is Katie Powers, who at the end of High School wishes to lose her virginity. With her her best friend Rose (Lauren Walsh) they attend an end of school senior's party where she hopes to make this wish come true. However to make things more complex she has always remembered a kiss she had as a young girl - which happened at Halloween so she has never known who her 'true love' really was.

Olivia Alaina May is mainly known as a singer, and it shows here as her acting is dreadful. She moves throughout the house going from one attempt to another to have sex. She goes into a room where a guy wants her to whip him. Another room has two girls and a guy who ask her to join them. Another room has a guy into tantric sex, and so on. She just cannot seem to have sex!

There's very little shocking, except where she attempts to trim her 'bush' which is clearly a wig. There's even less comedy. It's boring. It's like a 1970's British sex farce where someone goes from one titillating situation to another without any 'fulfillment' in any. That is, until the end - because this is an American film and it has to have a neat happy ending... her 'true love' is also at the party.",1379030400,7,1432,4.257352941176471
