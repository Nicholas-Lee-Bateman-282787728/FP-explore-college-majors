In all of their posts on social media sites, it appeared as if this movie was about the full history of tattooing in America.  It was really only about the latino influence on tattooing in America.

5724926,5,B00CKXH3P0,"To everyone here that has been posting and stereotyping individuals with tattoos as low class, uneducated, and trashy are simply close minded. I personally have an arm sleeve that reminds me every day to stay in the present moment and enjoy life through spiritual ideals. Yes, I am only in my 20s and I have participated in quite a few irresponsible acts throughout my life. More importantly, I have also backpacked Europe, earned my Bachelors degree, worked for the government, started my own business, and I am currently working towards my PhD.
To those ""high standard"" bosses who are posting they would never hire an individual with tattoos: not only are you ignorant and naive but who would want to work for an immoral boss that degrades fellow humans with stereotyping and judgments anyhow? Get off your high horse and start treating people, potential employees and neighbors alike, with respect.
Yes, I have met a lot of indecent humans covered in tattoos living by their own justifications and guidelines, but I have met even more of these drifters that don't have any tattoos! I have also met a few that sit in your egotistical position eager to abuse their power and trump on someones potential because they don't follow your ideals on life. Maybe if you opened your minds and your hearts, life and humans wouldn't always appear to you as negative.
If your against tattoos that is completely understandable and is your birth right. But please keep your stereotypes to yourself because it is not us right now that resemble the uneducated fools.",1377648000,4,1552,4.882575757575758
