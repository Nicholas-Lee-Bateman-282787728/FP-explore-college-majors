5972939,5,B00FA9AC3G,Thrilled to finally have the entire series and the price was incredibly cheap!!! Only small complaint is that there are no special features on these newer re-released versions. Regardless these are well worth purchasing even if you already own one or more seasons (like I do) as you will not find the separate seasons you are missing for a cheaper price and can always sell or give away the ones you already own.,1430006400,6,412,4.657534246575342
5972940,5,B00FA9AC3G,Fans of Gene Roddenberry will enjoy this series as man welcomes a species called the Taelons to Earth.  Not everyone believes the Companions to be all they say they are and throughout each episode you find they might just be right!,1427673600,2,231,4.634146341463414

5972944,5,B00FA9AC3G,"I can't review the quality of this DVD set, but I *can* give a quick review of the show itself. This show was on par with Star Trek, in my belief. The concept was great, the writing was good, and the story was enthralling. If you want a solid sci-fi show, this is it!",1390089600,6,267,3.962962962962963

5972950,5,B00FA9AC3G,We liked this series so much on Netflix that we spent the money to get all 5 years.,1486857600,,83,3.6666666666666665

5972953,4,B00FA9AC3G,"Liked the first season but the storylines then get a bit hard to follow with all the subplots, but still a good watch.",1480723200,,118,4.173913043478261
5972954,5,B00FA9AC3G,This is one of the best series ever on TV. I am surprising pleased with this presentation.,1478304000,,90,4.352941176470588

5972956,4,B00FA9AC3G,"Good quality DVDs and packaging.  Great season one and two, but the rest is mediocre and the last should never have aired.",1474416000,4,122,4.545454545454546
5972957,4,B00FA9AC3G,"This show debuted alongside Nightman and Beastmaster.  But whereas those shows last 2 & 3 Seasons respectively, Earth Final Conflict lasted a respectable 5 seasons.  The premise of the show was straight forward with way way way too many subplots.  An alien race called the Taelons came to Earth with a mission of peace.  But a group of humans suspected the Taelons were not truthful and from there the show went into overdrive for 5 seasons.  It seemed as though the writers could not figure out which direction the show wanted to take and capture the right tone.  The cast swapped out more times than I could count, established characters were killed off at break-neck speed and new characters were introduced.  For its time and on network television the special effects and make-up were not all that bad.  Its truly a testament that the show lasted as long as it did.",1473897600,3,869,4.708609271523179
5972958,4,B00FA9AC3G,"Very mixed feelings about this series. I am a big Roddenberry fan and had seen the first season on Netflix, but the last four seasons are only available by buying the DVDs. This was OK with me because I have a complete Roddenberry collection.

The writing gets a 4 instead of a 5 and is not up to the same standard as Star Trek. This is a Canadian/German production and the actors are trained and professional. The sets and costumes are typical sci-fi cheese, but I love that.

There are 22 episodes per season and they finish the story arc. (Hurray! REAL seasons, not one those leave-you-hungry pitiful 12 episode runs.) The last four episodes of season 5 look like Andy Warhol got hold of the original material. It is distracting at first, but I could ""filter"" it out and ignore it (mostly). There are no subtitles.

Despite the subpar production values, and the herky-jerky scripting and casting (plot is all over the place and quite the wild ride and the cast plays musical chairs), it is still Roddenberry with his hopeful and evolutionary view of humanity. I need Roddenberry's optimism in my life. Don't we all?",1471737600,10,1118,4.66497461928934

5972961,1,B00FA9AC3G,THE SHOW STARTED OFF GREAT. BUT IN THE END THE PLOT AS WELL AS THE CHARACTERS WERE JUST A BLACK HOLE (in space) SUCKING THE VERY LIFE ENERGY OF MY BEING.,1469059200,5,153,3.967741935483871
5972962,5,B00FA9AC3G,We have loved re-watching this classic sci-fi series! It's translated well to the this day and age and it's amazing to us that the quality of special effects is so high for the time period the series was produced in.,1465862400,4,216,4.425

5972983,2,B00FA9AC3G,"Inconsistent, underdeveloped scenario, mostly uninteresting characters... The basic story written by Gene Roddenberry is probably very interesting (I am a fan of Star Trek series), but for some reason, its development into a TV series has not really succeeded.",1448409600,2,260,5.6923076923076925

8613721,5,B00FA9AC3G,"Great series, glad to be able now to see the complete series. When I first watched this on TV it was very random on what day and time slot it played in, seemed it was mostly after midnight and because of that missed much of the series. The discs are DVDs and as such it is DVD quality, arrived in good condition with no scratches and so far plays just fine (half way through season 2). Would loved to had this on Bluray.",1520208000,2,420,4.072289156626506

8613726,2,B00FA9AC3G,"Each season came individually wrapped, and each season I received has a different mix of spoken and subtitle languages. Season 1 has spoken english and english subtitles; Seasons 2 and 3 both have spoken english and spoken french, but no subtitles at all; Season 4 has only spoken english, no subtitles; and Season 5 has spoken english and french with no subtitles.

I prefer watching with subtitles and am upset that most seasons don't have them.",1498780800,7,447,4.881578947368421
