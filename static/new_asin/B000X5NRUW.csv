8226990,5,B000X5NRUW,"""I want sacks."" -- Mina to Young-jae

South Korea long ago eclipsed every other nation's film industry in regard to romanticist cinema. Sensitive and tender in their approach to love and romance, of any age, their films often imbued with a longing for love and happiness just beyond our grasp, yet passing close enough to make the heart ache, they have created a beautiful genre over the past decade or so all their own. It is why, where matters of the heart are concerned, Korea is the country of choice for film fans. The deceptively sweet and simple story of a girl with a deformed hand, and perhaps little time, would no doubt have retained some of its fragrance had it been filmed elsewhere, but never would it have achieved such poignancy, or reached the depth of emotion it draws from the viewer, with its tender urging to live life to the fullest, and most importantly, to experience love. This lovely film about a young girl, her mother, and her unexpected boyfriend, is one more sparkling example of how Korea is getting it right, and leaving everyone else in their dust.

Lee Eon-hie's restrained direction, allowing Kim Jin's story to play out naturally, makes for a wistful ode to life and love so deeply moving, it is impossible not to be touched by it on a profound level. Tear-jerker is a term often used to describe films which only elicit superficial tears, forgotten an hour after walking from a theatre, or by lunch the next day. Films such as Il Mare, A Moment to Remember, Ditto, and ..ing, are heartrending, moving on a more substantive and touching level, and remembered long afterward, and, in fact, never forgotten at all. It would be impossible to forget the sweetness of this film, or the beguiling performance of Im Su-jeong as Mina. Kim Rae-won as the slightly older boy who ingratiates himself into her life, and Lee Mi-sook as Mina's loving and playful mother, Misuk, both help this film become something very special.  This film is a wistful breeze of emotions, becoming a wind so strong, and full of feeling, we find ourselves unable to stop the flow of water from our eyes.

Misuk is a vibrant and loving mother with a playful relationship with her daughter. Mina has a deformed hand she hides beneath a glove, loves ballet, and has a relationship with her mom nearly all girls of her age would envy. Over time, however, director Eon-hie, shows the viewer, through conversations the mother has with a friend, that there is more here than meets the eye. Attending school after a long illness, Mina enjoys listening to music and smoking outside her bedroom window at night, which leads her to meet her new neighbor, Young-jae (Kim Rae-won), who likes taking pictures. Forgetting to return the lighter which has meaning for her, he offers his two small turtles, Neil and Armstrong, as hostages. A few years older than she, he shows an interest, to her shock and surprise, and finally confesses a crush on her. Her mother encourages her, even asking him to accompany the two on a trip to Hawaii, which is his favorite spot, at some future date. Misuk's actions, and hints that she may not always be with her Mina, lead to speculation on the viewer's part that there will be a twist coming in what we thought we knew.

Before that twist comes, in a moment of sadness, viewers are treated to a sweet love story, filled with humor and charm. Im Su-jeong completely captivates our hearts through her honest performance. When the twist does come, it will come as a shock, and change everything we have seen. In what time is left, director Eon-hie squeezes our heart with moments of sacrifice so tender, more than a few sobs must have filled theaters when this was shown in darkened movie houses in South Korea. Breathtakingly simple, and heartbreakingly beautiful, this most lovely Korean romance is for any age, and a reminder to enjoy every single moment of love when it comes our way. Another winner from Korea.",1276387200,4,3940,4.712626995645864
