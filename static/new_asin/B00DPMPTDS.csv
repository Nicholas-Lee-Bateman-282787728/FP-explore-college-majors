5845062,5,B00DPMPTDS,"These DVD's are a dubbed or taped version of the series that aired on a cable station; however the quality is good and so are the subtitles. For those, who are nitpickers, be aware that this is a television station recording, so adverts/news may stream across the bottom throughout the series' episodes and that if the character had a lot to say, then you will see almost a full screen of subtitles of what you heard. The person, who worked on the subtitles did you modern language at times for English-speaking understanding, which may be a nice touch for some. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase because I enjoyed this period drama. There are good action sequences, romance and convoluted deceptions that you expect from royalty. I find the little things that may bother will fall aside because the series is well-written, acted and shot.",1415750400,4,843,4.820689655172414
5845063,4,B00DPMPTDS,"A fantasy story mingling the past and future times. A subtle love story develops. The bad guys are bad, bad, bad and evil. Lots of fight scenes and killings. Poisoning is a frequent method used to get rid of someone. The theme of how a good ruler should rule puts the king in situations and confrontations to act and think wisely. The acting is good.",1411862400,,350,4.4

8596093,4,B00DPMPTDS,"Have enjoyed this series. I've been into Korean dramas lately and wanted to see another one with Lee Min Ho. Interesting it turned out to be a time travel romance. The English subtitles are pretty good, and I wouldn't be able to follow along since I don't know Korean. I even learned a lot about Korean history, and had to double check things on-line to understand the historical references. Totally worth buying if you like ""Boys With Flowers"" or other dramas with Lee Min-ho.",1453507200,,477,4.690476190476191
