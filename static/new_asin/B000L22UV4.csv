8159926,2,B000L22UV4,"you get to watch this guy put on small pieces of clay for 45 minutes.  Yes he has some great sculpting techniques, but it takes so long to get to them, it's crazy.  Should have cut away and come back.

I was also expecting this to show how to prep, pour and cast the finished sculptures in latex, to create masks.",1413849600,,313,4.098360655737705

8159931,5,B000L22UV4,"This is a great video for visual learners, he doesn't hold your hand all the way through but with sculpting, the best way to learn is to see someone do it. If you watch and attempt these techniques on your own it will be very informative and worth the money.  He's a great sculptor and some of the tools he uses to achieve realism is pretty ingenious.",1333929600,,351,4.2388059701492535
8159932,2,B000L22UV4,"I bought this DVD thinking it would help me learn to sculpt, but all I learned is that the author can sculpt, and he shows off his talent.  He's amazing, don't get me wrong, but if you're looking to learn how to sculpt, there's not much this DVD has to offer in my opinion.",1288569600,6,273,4.055555555555555
