483835,2,6302593247,"Yeesh. One of those dreadful Sixties Dramas (please note the portentious use of Capital Letters) that are Boldly Adapted from a Stage Play, and full of Psychology-laden monologues and horrendously overwritten, absurdly unnatural-sounding repartee. Shirley MacLaine is a ""bohemian"" Jewish girl, living in the nutty clamour of Greenwich Village (which we see very little of, sadly), and Robert Mitchum is the ""square"" from Omaha who barges into her life and begins bossing her around, in an effort to recapture his Lost Masculinity. The film is interminable and way too stagey. MacLaine has some winsome moments, and the B&W cinematography is kinda nice, but nothing can save this overly-mannered shipwreck from foundering, again and again, on the shoals of its own pretensions. I guess in some ways I feel lucky that I wasn't living in New York back in the Kennedy era, when you'd have to go to the theatre and take this sort of boring pseudo-sermonizing seriously.",1029542400,6,964,5.146496815286624
483836,4,6302593247,"The first time I watched this, I was captivated by Mitchum and MacLaine together.  I was engrossed with their love story.  The second time I watched this movie it stuck me a little bit more profound then just a love story.
Mitchum plays a man, who is dissatisfied with the life that had coddled him, tired of accepting what people handed out to him.  He feels as if he has been given a life of luxury at the cost of his own independence.  He is tired of taking and wants to give what he has to offer.
Then we have MacLaine.  A somewhat innocent and a bit naive woman who has a heart as big as the city she lives in.  She gives and gives with no thought or expectations of reciprocation. She is strong and independent. Yet, she is afraid to need someone, to love someone, to let someone give to her.
Then these two meet. Mitchum at last has something to offer someone, enjoys giving what he has, and taking care of someone else, instead of him being taken care of.  MacLaine finally has someone to unravel those walls of independence and allows herself to need someone.  It's a beautiful relationship that really reaches out to me.
Not only that but Mitchum and MacLaine are magnificent in it.  I love the fact that this was filmed in black and white.  Color would only distract and add unnecessary noise to the message this movie brings to the viewer. So do these two live happy ever after?  Watch it and find out.  :o)",973296000,25,1419,4.35361216730038

483890,4,6302593247,"The story of two misfits managing a bumpy doomed romance in early 1960s New York, photographed in moody black and white. The film is a tad dated but does offer a kernel of truth about the complications of two very flawed people trying to connect.

Adapted from a stage play, the film version suffers from overlong dialogue and the bad casting of Mitchum, who is too taciturn and disaffected to be remotely engaging. He usually plays tough guys, and while he has his appeal, he just doesnt work here as a romantic lead. In the mouth of someone like Richard Burton or Jack Lemmon, Jerry Ryans lines might sound clever or charming, but Mitchum sounds like a grim, depressive, controlling abuser (and he does manipulate and smack Gittel a few times  and in those politically incorrect times, she just takes it). MacLaine, who is excellent as usual, affects some New Yawk Jewish girl quirks as Gittel Mosca, a free-spirited but struggling former dancer who calls em like she sees em but still gives, gives, gives.

Its hard to understand how she and displaced Nebraska lawyer Jerry get together in the first place, considering that WASPy Jerryin Big Apple self-exile while his wife divorces him-- only reaches out because he has no other options. Gittel is merely curious. For her, Jerry is just the latest in a string of bad relationships that she kills by being way too accommodating (something I can relate to). And Jerry is slumming, trying to make up through easy-breezy Gittel for everything he failed to do in his marriage. There is no way this is going to last. Not only are they culturally miles apart, Jerry is in his 40s and Gittel is just 29; further, Jerry has a law degree while Gittel  though no dummy  only finished high school. Once they throw in together, they try to make it work by shoring each other up through thick and thin, but its no use. Gittel knows she cant hold him, and sabotages the relationship by sleeping with someone else. They both know hes still in love with his wife. They end it, and manage to stay friends.

 I think thats what I like about the film, finally, though Im not sure I would sit through it again: Some relationships are only meant to last for a season, and once we understand that, theres no need for recriminations. Breaking up is never easy, fun, or happy. But Jerry and Gittel are very clear that though it didn't last, they are both far better people for the experience.",1399507200,2,2421,4.616279069767442
483891,4,6302593247,"I watched this movie purely out of love for Shirley MacLaine, but it was really touching. Dated and sexist in a lot of ways, certainly, but with some beautiful messages about honesty and working to meet your own needs. The movie proceeds VERY slowly--with not much action and a lot of melodramatic dialogue--but it's easy to empathize with both characters and you leave feeling satisfied.

I've read the Gibson play many times and have seen this movie several times as well.  It is dated but well worth the viewing.

483896,4,6302593247,"This is a fine old black and white movie, a product of its time, romantic and thoughtful and bit melancholy. It has two first rate actors, a great director, and interesting story, so why do I give it only 4 stars? Because the format is non anamorphic. I thought this had already been settled. A non anamorphic transfer can only play well on an older 4 by 3 T.V. set (I don't know if they still make them). On a high definition set, half the picture image is reduced (there are black bars entirely around the image and it is about half the size it would be if it were anamorphic - 'enhanced' is another term used for anamorphic) and there is some loss of clarity. If it is a matter of cost, we are already paying a premium price and for it, we should get the best possible picture. At the same time I purchased this film, I purchased A Thousand Clowns (from the same distributor as Two For The Seesaw) and it was anamorphic. More or less, the same price, so why not anamorphic? Its a good film but it could be better - why not?",1330473600,2,1026,4.186868686868687
483927,4,6302593247,"I remembered watching ""Sweet Charity"" when I was just a teenager. I am now well into my fifties and I decided to revisit this movie.  What I remembered was it's visual style, I couldn't remember the story,  but after watching it again I had to conclude, that was really all it had. The story was a little story and the musical was too much, and all I can say watching the movie years later, I felt like I was wasting my time. Shirley MacLaine, made an early career of being a cute dumb sweet innocent, but by the time she performed in Sweet Charity, she seemed too old for the part. She managed her extremely energetic dance scenes , but the energy came from a work ethic, not from the exuberance of her youth. Her love interest played by Oscar Lindquist who, was just about perfectly cast, didn't help the movie in any way.  It didn't draw me in although it still had great dance sequences and Edith Head outdid herself with the costumes;  in the end all the extremes with the audio and visual elements just buried the story.  Recently I saw the same little story again, in the movie ""Two for the Seesaw"".  The director, Robert Wise, regretted that Robert Mitchum, was cast in the role of Jerry, the callow youth from the Midwest who runs away from his velvet cage, to try to become his own man. How old was Mitchum when he made this film?  Obviously he was much too old for the part, too strong of a character, with a voice much too deep and powerful to say the words demanded from the script. I have read that MacLaine wasn't authentically Jewish enough although I loved her performance in this movie. I guess the characters in ""Two for the Seesaw"" are essentially at odds with the script, but what wasn't at odds with the script was an emotional story.  The emotional story was that Shirley MacLaine, in this movie was a sweet young innocent, yet could create an empathic connection with a man, that was all wrong on a physical and cultural level for her. Robert Mitchum was a man who fell for a much younger woman from the wrong side of town, and the movie brings out the realities of why it can't work. The dialogue was all about Jerry's emotional inability to leave a twelve year marriage, but this could easily apply to an older man's inability to leave his wife of many years.  He complains that his wife has over mothered him, but Mitchum's desire to take care of MacLaine seems authentic from  paternalistic point of view. Mitchum's despair and loneliness, is something many older men experience as they confront what they have made of their lives, with real emotional regret. The casting of this movie should have made it unbearable to watch, but it was a delight to watch, and I have to conclude, the reason is because the emotional chemistry between Mitchum and MacLaine was telling it's own story outside of the lines of the script. Years later MacLaine confides she and Mitchum started an affair that lasted well past the filming of the movie, and that chemistry ultimately makes this movie succeed, and without it, makes ""Sweet Charity"" fail.  ""Sweet Charity"" has MacLaine in the lead roll, but she is the wrong woman for Oscar Lindquist on all levels.  It is very hard to believe that Shirley fell in love with Oscar, and so all Sweet Charity has is some grand dance numbers, and costumes.",1318032000,,3307,4.530201342281879
483928,5,6302593247,"I'm frankly astonished at the number of negative reviews of this film, but I think I may know the reason why. First of all it seems that all the DVD's out there (the only non DVD-R versions, like Amazon offers, are Region 2) are cut down to full screen instead of giving us the very effective use of the original widescreen. Sin one, as the exceptional camera work drew an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography.

It also appears that the DVD version may have been edited to de-emphasize the pretty blatant sexuality and passion, as it seems to have been marketed after the Sixties as a light hearted romantic comedy. Sin two. It's hardly funny. It's a serious, heart wrenching drama.

I just watched the original version on TCM and was blown away by it, especially by Shirley Maclaine's compelling performance, for which she also received an Oscar nomination.

Perhaps we can someday look forward to a restored version of the original work. This film deserves it.

Very powerful stuff.",1315267200,4,988,4.794117647058823

I, as an eight year old was so engrossed in the acting I forgot I was seeing something for adults. I rememberd this movie my entire life and only was able to find it again five years ago. I have watched it three times. I love this movie and I love the grittyness of it and I fell deeply in love with Mitchem all over again. This is one of the most underrated movies out there.

483930,5,6302593247,"I've waited a long time to get this movie on DVD.  I think it's one of Mitchum's best.  He actually does some acting and MacLaine is every bit as good as he is.  Though he's usually cast as a tough, competent, somewhat thuggish macho man, he pulled off his empathetic lawyer's character without missing a beat.  Lots of lonely and lots of grim artfully done with the black and white images.  You'll want a hankie for your date if you share this with wife or girlfriend.  Worth seeing, and a lot more realistic than many movies these days.",1266969600,2,538,4.438775510204081
483931,4,6302593247,"I decided to watch ""Two for the Seesaw"" because it starred Robert Mitchum and I must say that this is one of his better movies.  His strong, forceful ""man in control"" persona comes through very well.  Unfortunately, that's the major problem I had with ""Two for the Seesaw"" because the lead male role calls, in my opinion, for a more bewildered man.  Consider the plot's premise; A middle-aged lawyer from Nebraska comes to New York City to escape his marital problems at home.  He meets a Greenich Village-type woman who's his complete oppostite and they attempt to have a normal relationship.  I looked up the history of this play and Dana Andrews as well as Henry Fonda (a REAL Nebraska fellow) played the part on stage.  Without knowing for sure, I presume that they brought a humorous sort of ""Gee Whiz"" bewilderment at not only the big city but the strange folks that live there.  I presume that this made this comedy a funnier presentation than Mitchum's ""ho-hum, nothing gets in my way"" approach.  With his leading role, the rest of the cast had to put together whatever humor they could salvage.  Maybe I'm missing the playwrite's purpose; maybe he meant to show a man buckled under by others controlling his life who becomes a person looking for someone he could control.  I think not.

OK that's out of the way, now for the positives.  Mitchum and MacLaine work very well together and create a very interesting relationship.  As I said, this is one of his best ""Robert Mitchum"" preformances.  There is a good supporting cast but it's essentially a two person show.  There is a soundtrack that is outstanding.  Whoever was playing that trumpet has a knack for jazzy blues.  I was absorbed in the movie but I kept thinking that someone was coming on too strong.  Apparently the director, Robert Wise, didn't think so.",1175817600,5,1825,4.7215189873417724
483932,3,6302593247,"The William Gibson play-cum-film Two for the Seesaw was on TCM recently, and being a Robert Mitchum fan I wanted to see it. Not to mention Shirley MacLaine (yes, she's been around forever!), Robert Wise (his first post-West Side Story direction) and Andre Previn doing the music.

But little did I know that the music and the cinematography (by Ted D. McCord) would be the best part of this film. Both were nominated for Academy Awards, they stand out so much-not that Mitchum and MacLaine, who dominate this two-hander almost totally, were terrible, to the contrary-that the movie became more of a celebration of New York in glorious black & white, and the jazz score a stunning evokation of the tumult of star-crossed love.

I certainly was surprised by Mitchum's settled and reserved performance here, as a seperated wandering Nebraskan lawyer who falls hard for a younger dancer. His characteristic muscularity or physical imposition is covered by a sharp suit the whole time, and the internal strife of his instability-which is only exacerbated by MacLaine's Gittel, her immaturity and vibrance-combined for a distinct performance in the Mitchum canon. MacLaine by the way is very cute and spunky here, sharp and vulnerable, & but for her nasally whim and inflections, she is also excellent.

But the cinematography of Ted D. McCord and the music of Andre Previn are the highlights here. In fact I later realized that Two for the Seesaw was on TCM because of it's brilliant cinematography, scheduled along with To Catch a Thief, Black Narcissus, A Farewell to Arms, all of which won Oscars for cinematography, and The Facts of Life, which was also nominated....",1171152000,10,1666,5.007220216606498
483933,5,6302593247,"For every exigent situation in life that ends in happiness, another ends in tragedy... Life IS a zero sum game. Only two pictures in my life, have moved me to tears....Two for the Seesaw is the second one. The other moved me on a more superficial level, for a death of a young love is almost unthinkable. That movie was LOVE STORY, and at that time I was young and in love, when death is imponderable. This movie leaves both protagonists alive, but both of them with a hurt inside, that will never heal. It would have been easy to let MacLaine and Mitchum live happily ever after. But, that would not be real life, which is a series of unrequited loves that ultimately fail, interspersed with new loves that(look at marriage statistics and factor in all the bad marriages that stay together for children, family, societal mores,etc.) most often fail again and again. Evolution is not the best way to propagate a species, just the most efficient. Evolution works great, until you add a large frontal lobe to the brain.",1168905600,5,1017,4.624309392265193
483934,5,6302593247,"Like Helen Morgan's ""Applause"", the film version of ""Two For the Seesaw"" gives its viewers a seldom seen look at the real theatre world of New York City in the 20th Century. This is a gritty, realistic love story on the cold, hard streets of New York that somehow is still able to show the real romance of the giant city. Not unlike the neo-realism of Fellini, Viscounti and Pausolini, ""Two for the Seesaw"" shows how actors and artists romatically collide with everyday people as they barely hang onto their dreams. Shirlely MacLaine lived this life before ""The Pajama Game"" and probably had friends like Gittel Mosca who were still striving for greatness long after MacLaine was a star. And Robert Mitchum, always surprising in roles in which he seemed to be wrongfullly cast, was never better. All this superior quality is magnified in the beauty and clarity of black and white. Don't read the following reviews. Those people have never been in love and working in the theatre in New York. I have and know how right-on this film is. It should be on DVD in widescreen.

483935,3,6302593247,"Unfortunately for viewers, this is a bad adaption of a brilliant play.  This two-character relationship drama, William Gibson's first play, works extraordinarily well on the stage, with the two characters originally performed by Henry Fonda and Anne Bancroft on Broadway.
However, the drama onstage is lost onscreen; it flounders, and leaves the audience with a bad taste in their mouth.
The theatrical ""trick"" of a two character play is that it brings the audience close to the characters in a way that many larger plays cannot and most films do.  As a film, then, the two character drama seem an artistic conceit rather than dramatic device.
Moreover, some of the better concepts of the play are lost in the film format.  Despite the excellent performances of Mitchum and MacLaine, this play just doesn't translate well to film, and the adaption isn't worth much attention.
I would highly recommend seeing this on stage if you should get the opportunity, or renting the film if you're a real classic movie buff, but buying it is not a good idea.
I'm giving it three stars because I know the writing and ideas here are excellent; were it an original screenplay I'd only give it two or even one.",1051833600,2,1195,4.819512195121951
483936,4,6302593247,"Robert Mitchum and Shirley MacLaine star in ""Two For The Seesaw"", which is a movie that I enjoyed very much. It's refreshing to see Mitchum in a softer (and non-violent) role. (Although, Bob does manage to get in one good whack in this film. But, Shirley gets him back [twice] later in the picture.)

Mr. Mitchum was a very busy actor in the early 1960s, with ""Seesaw"" already representing his 8th film during the still-very-young decade of the '60s. The first seven being: ""Home From The Hill"" (1960), ""A Terrible Beauty"" (1960), ""The Sundowners"" (1960), ""The Grass Is Greener"" (1960), ""The Last Time I Saw Archie"" (1961), ""Cape Fear"" (1962), and ""The Longest Day"" (1962).

With just one film in between, Mitchum went from portraying hardened criminal ""Max Cady"" in ""Cape Fear"", to his role as a gentle lawyer in ""Two For The Seesaw"". Mitch's superb versatility was never more apparent than in those two 1962 films.

MacLaine and Mitchum are on screen for very nearly the entire 1 hour and 59 minutes here, and (IMO) treat us to some very good, on-target, realistic dialogue. And the ending was a bit of a twist, which is another big plus.

One line in the script that I particularly thought hit the mark was when Shirley berates Robert with: ""Who needs to work THAT hard if things [in a relationship] are going right?!"". Makes good sense. There are several clever lines like that in the film.

As I watched this film, I kept being reminded of ""The Hustler"" (1961), which is very similar in pace, style, and looks. The small confines of the drab apartments and the overall dark visuals are very much the same in both movies.

The black-and-white ""Seesaw"" premiered in movie theaters on November 21, 1962, and was one of 41 films directed by the distinguished Robert Wise (with ""Seesaw"" being sandwiched between two of his other highly-notable directorial efforts -- ""West Side Story"" in 1961 and ""The Haunting"" in '63).

Featuring two standout acting talents and one of the best directors in the biz calling the shots behind the cameras, ""Two For The Seesaw"" is certainly a motion picture worth seeing.",1034899200,11,2103,4.776859504132231
