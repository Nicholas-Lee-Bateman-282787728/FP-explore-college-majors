8750518,4,B01BLONBCC,"Mondo gives you more excellent bang for your buck. They give you a good transfer, multiple documentaries on Jose Larraz and a plethora of other goodies all on one disk. At the 16 dollars give or take I paid, I got more entertainment than most multiple episode TV shows and all in less time.

The movie itself is solid. It's the kind of thriller that isn't quite in vogue anymore given the prudish Tumblr and Twitter sexual politics of the day and it's filmed in a way that feels like you're watching a creepy day dream. It's a heady combo of sexual frustration/identity confusion mixed up with increasing paranoia. I haven't even given any spoilers with that description. It's a fantastic movie in that sense. Director Larraz and cinematographer/camera man Trevor Wreen have a particular soft focus way of filming things. They're like much more successful Jean Rollin but mixed with British thrillers like Girly, Twisted Nerve, and The Haunted House.

Buy it quick so Mondo can keep pumping these things out!",1465776000,13,1008,4.854651162790698
8750519,4,B01BLONBCC,"Mondo Macabro, this one is for all you old school film geeks like me. I can remember back in the early 90s when only Suncoast would sell the dvds and they would be asking 39.99 for a single one. (and funny enough, getting it) They are known in the community as the daring label. You watch one of their films to count how many taboos you see being broken. If you are going to create an insane experience, you have to go all out and this is the label that has their foot to the gas when it comes to wanting to disturb an audience. I expected this film to be a take on the Franco legacy, and what I got out of this film completely floored me and felt more like a dope smoking Hitchcock and Bergman. Where the discussion will always be presented about the bounds of art and the visionary depth it chooses to take, this film not only captivates but it also manipulates and triumphs overall in just how rich and insane it truly is. This film takes a bath in sleaze, and creates a depth with it that we forget character development and plot are being thrown to the side. The horror in this film is very rich and at times beautifully executed in this orchestra of anxiety and lust. The film like most Mondo releases focuses on two women, Helen who occupies the mansion that is in the middle of the woods and her friend Anne who comes by to hang out. Helen is a sexual free beauty who dabbles in masturbation and writing in a diary.

 We get the feeling she is her trying to lure Anne in her web of lust. Anne though is working on a book of sorts. Then they have the token neighbor who is named Brady who loves to stare at these vessels of lust and insertion. Helen as the film progresses lets us know she can hear things that no one can quite hear. This film in general should fail, it has a longer than usual time to it. The material in the early going seem to be the strongest, but the funny thing is that this film builds and builds and remains strong throughout. This film lacks so much, but it works so well with what it does offer. I found myself many times trying to figure this film out and just being shocked that I am into it as much as I am. I will say as far as this label goes, this is one of their stronger films to date. This film is just such a ticking bomb of a build. Overall, this film is such a must see just for the simple fact it is so out of left field insane. I am not going to mention the controversial moments or scenes, I want people to be surprised when they watch it. Plus this is one of those films, if you go into blind like I did, you will get so much more out of it. So, you film nerds who go to your local mall and cry over the closings of Suncoast, Movie Stop and other video chains, there are still some awesome films coming out that you may want to seek out and buy, this being the top of the class.",1463616000,14,2828,4.048214285714286
