I however, find them to be delightfully weird & hilarious. Finding them both together was absolutely thrilling for me!",1464825600,,259,4.416666666666667
4189781,5,B003SXHZFY,Great movies for a great price.  Only shortcoming is that both movies are on one disc.  Funny stories and crazy story plots.,1461542400,,124,4.590909090909091

4189785,5,B003SXHZFY,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost cannot be beat as a comedy duo. I bought this combo just for ""Hot Fuzz"" but ended up loving both movies. If you love comedy, british humor, slap-stick humor, or Simon Pegg and/or Nick Frost buy this set. I recommend it.",1449187200,,245,4.3478260869565215

4189803,5,B003SXHZFY,My husband loves this duo of boy movies.,1411948800,,40,4.125
4189804,5,B003SXHZFY,Simon Pegg and his troup of regular co-stars are hilarious in Shaun of the Dead a parody of zombie movies and Hot Fuzz a story of a too perfect police officer. Some of the humor is British and leave some Americans in the dust. It's worth pausing and checking a search engine to get the gags. (I had to explain the cricket bat to a young friend.) Laughs from beginning to end.,1411084800,,375,4.222222222222222
4189805,5,B003SXHZFY,AWESOME!,1409875200,,8,8.0

4189807,5,B003SXHZFY,"Simon Pegg delivers, as usual. Two separate discs include all the special features.",1406246400,,83,5.461538461538462
4189808,4,B003SXHZFY,"Let me preface this review by stating that I am prudish when movies push the ""Foul Language Barrier"" as much as possible.  Both of these films are filled with many, many repetitions of offensive words.  As a fan of Pop Cinema, I consider the use of profanity within most scripts to be filler that is inserted because the writers could not think of anything intelligent to write.

Having stated that, each film is a pretty decent spoof of Zombie movies in the case of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and of U.S.A. Cop-Buddy movies in the case of ""Hot Fuzz.""  The sound quality of ""Hot Fuzz"" is particularly good on this Blu-Ray collection.",1401840000,,626,4.5625
4189809,5,B003SXHZFY,"I thought I was getting blu-ray, but that was my bad.  Two of my very favorite movies of all time, great packaging, quality dvd's, and good extras.  Love it.",1400112000,,157,4.379310344827586
4189810,5,B003SXHZFY,Faster shipping than expected! Very happy! Plus these movies will never fail to make you laugh! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost together are hilarious,1399939200,,144,5.041666666666667
4189811,5,B003SXHZFY,These movies are entertaining and won't fail to make your miserable day into a non-stop laughter. Priceless funny moments from Simon Pegg and the crew.,1399334400,,151,5.08
4189812,5,B003SXHZFY,It played. All I asked for. If it didn't you're not out a lot of money anyways. I am satisfied,1396483200,,94,3.75
4189813,5,B003SXHZFY,"I like both of these movies a lot, and here they are, both together.  Nice quality and a good deal.",1394928000,,99,3.95
4189814,4,B003SXHZFY,"Great movies, Cult Classics.  Funnier every time you watch!  I'm glad I was able to get these as a combo pack",1394582400,,109,4.142857142857143
4189815,5,B003SXHZFY,Hot fuzz is one of my favorite movies and definitely my favorite of the Corentto trilogy. Its hilariously gor ry,1393632000,,112,4.65
4189816,4,B003SXHZFY,"Arrived quickly and in good shape, despite the snow storm.  Movies were just what I expected wirh not much in the extras department",1392336000,,131,4.695652173913044
4189817,5,B003SXHZFY,Zombie movies usually have me rolling my eyes due to the inherent implausibility of slow moving piles of dog food ending human civilization. This one has numerous funny situations that actually look kinda plausible. See for yourself. I have watched it several times and its still got that fresh zombie movie smell....Hot Fuzz is really good too. They put in swerves that you see coming and then its not at all what you think.,1390176000,,425,4.756756756756757
4189818,5,B003SXHZFY,This is hilarious in double pack with non-stop goofy adventure of Simon Pegg and the rest of crew find and success the final destination.,1390089600,,137,4.75
4189819,5,B003SXHZFY,"Two movies for the price of one!!!! Hot Fuzz is okay, enjoyable and witty. Shaun of the Dead is an instant classic. Must have for any zombie collection - hilarious horror all in  one = Greatness.",1389744000,,195,4.416666666666667
4189820,5,B003SXHZFY,These are great movies and you can't beat this price. My husband really wanted the whole trilogy so we ordered this and then World's End separate.,1389225600,,146,4.653846153846154
4189821,3,B003SXHZFY,". But it's still a kind of Brit humor which survives the Atlantic. Generally, you can understand their english. Mostly, maybe. The big joke is the blotto dumbing down of one obnoxious character after regularly downing legions of pitchers of warm beer. Never though zombies could be funny; but some are, barely, initially. But after awhile even they pass out.",1388880000,,358,4.983333333333333
4189822,4,B003SXHZFY,Just ignore this text.  Amazon insists that I type out an individual response to close this out.  Product quality is consistent with the number of stars.,1386979200,,153,4.846153846153846
4189823,3,B003SXHZFY,"I couldn't really get into Shaun of the Dead.  I am not a fan of zombies to start, but to watch how Shaun (Simon Pegg) is basically enslaved to the ignorance of Ed (Nick Frost) makes me lose interest in the story.  If I were Ed, I would have used the zombie apocalypse to off Ed from the start and then fed the remains to the invading hoard.

As for Hot Fuzz, I thought it was quite funny and could get behind a character that was so good at his job, that he was forced to a remote location by his jealous comrades.

Of course, your mileage may vary, but I am voting with the positive, living guy, then a bunch of undead moaning in the streets.",1386979200,,644,4.047244094488189
4189824,4,B003SXHZFY,"An excellent buy on two of my favorite movies and, unlike many ""combo packs,"" this actually contains two separate blu-rays, with all of the extras. Definitely worth the price if you don't already own them!",1386460800,,205,4.885714285714286
4189825,5,B003SXHZFY,It's a must have if you like simon Pegg movies. You get two for one for cheep not bad at all.  Shaun of the dead is better then hot fuzz in my opinion but that's just what I think.  Still two good movies for less how can you beat that?,1386460800,,235,3.68
4189826,5,B003SXHZFY,The item was great and met my expectations- we had a lot of laughs. thank you. I really appreciate your help and prompt service,1386201600,,127,4.333333333333333

4189828,5,B003SXHZFY,"""Shaun"" is a 6, ""Fuzz"" is a 4.5, so a 5 seemed about right. Pegg's sendup of zombie movies while at the same time being a heartfelt commentary on family, romance, and friendship is pretty much unique in my experience. In ""Fuzz"", it's harder to buy Pegg as a British ""Dirty Harry"", but once you accept it, this sendup is strong on both hilarity and action.",1385596800,,355,4.393939393939394
4189829,5,B003SXHZFY,"Still two of the most clever and catchy comedies I have seen in my life, and excellent spoofs on the zombie genre and detective/action movie genres, respectively.",1384732800,,162,5.037037037037037
4189830,4,B003SXHZFY,Two fun movie in one place. They are movies and they are DVD's. They were well manufactured and played no problems.,1384732800,,115,4.523809523809524

4189832,5,B003SXHZFY,"Hilarious, hilarious, hilarious.  If you know Simon Pegg's and Nick Frost's work, you won't be disappointed. They make a great team.",1383782400,,132,5.285714285714286
4189833,5,B003SXHZFY,Great flicks in a great double feature. Shaun of the Dead is an amazing Horror Comedy and Hot Fuzz is a funny Comedy Buddy Cop Action flick. Both star Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Definite must have for fans of comedy.,1383177600,,216,4.2926829268292686
4189834,5,B003SXHZFY,"Love these movies. The packaging is also really economical in terms of space. It's the same thickness as a regular DVD box, but with two movies.",1383177600,,144,4.576923076923077
4189835,5,B003SXHZFY,Both of these blu-ray disks hold plenty of laughs. It's a lighter way of dealing with zombies when too many shows are actually taking themselves a bit too seriously.,1382486400,,165,4.724137931034483
4189836,5,B003SXHZFY,There is not much to say about this double feature.  You will know what you are getting before you order.  It is nice to have them together in one set! Simon Pegg and Nick Frost at their best!,1381968000,,192,4.026315789473684
4189837,5,B003SXHZFY,"Fans of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, rejoice! Two of their best and funniest movies for one price. Great acting, great writing, and many laugh out loud scenes. So much entertainment in one package, it's a must have for your video library.",1381881600,,236,4.642857142857143
4189838,5,B003SXHZFY,Best movies these guys have made. You can't beat the double feature pack. Two hilarious movies for one fab price!,1381363200,,113,4.7
4189839,5,B003SXHZFY,Sometimes you get one of these dual disc things and the quality is worse or something.  But that isn't the case here.  You get the movies on separate discs and unless it bothers you having both films in one case it is great.  If it bothers you that much then buy the double movie and then buy a couple blank cases and separate them and print out new artwork.  The transfer of both films are flawless and they do an excellent job.  I had no complaints.  I didn't really want to look at the extras that much but I did watch the cut scenes on Hot Fuzz which right now anyway is my favorite of the trilogy.,1381363200,2,602,4.102564102564102
4189840,5,B003SXHZFY,Love these movies & we couldn't beat the price for both! It did take a LONG time to get to us so don't expect to receive it in less than 2-3 weeks.,1381017600,,147,3.625
4189841,5,B003SXHZFY,Great price for these movies.  I probably watch these about once a year.  I went ahead and upgraded to the Blurays.  My kids will take the DVDs.,1380931200,,144,4.2592592592592595

4189843,5,B003SXHZFY,"Got these on sale, 2 Blu-Ray movies for under $10 is a hard deal to beat. Especially when it's a creation by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg.",1380672000,,135,4.037037037037037
4189844,5,B003SXHZFY,"Each disc has all the features that came with the original disc.
Lots of them too.  Usual Blu-Ray quality looks great on 1080p tv's.
Only caveat would be it may be worth waiting for a deal on all 3 when ""World's end"" comes out.",1380672000,,227,4.159090909090909

4189848,5,B003SXHZFY,"I believe they have another set now with the third movie in this series, The World's End, which would have been nice to have but overall I was impressed with the pack.  There are two discs with the movies instead of cramming them both on one with bad resolution which was the one major worry I had.",1378944000,,298,4.228070175438597

4189853,5,B003SXHZFY,"The first two in the amazing Blood & Ice Cream trilogy (w/ the third being The World's End).
First, a few reviews mention that the product is two movies on a single disc w/ no extras. I received two discs in one jewel case, all extras included.
Second, these movies are utter classics. Wright, Pegg and Frost can do no wrong. This is a downright steal at this price.",1377129600,9,366,4.318840579710145
4189854,5,B003SXHZFY,I love both of these movies.  I can't wait for the new movie to come out soon!  Should be good!,1376784000,,95,3.7
4189855,5,B003SXHZFY,The problem with most DVDs is all the extras that rise up the price when all I want to do is watch the movie.  This double feature is exactly that; two great movies for a good price,1376697600,2,181,3.891891891891892

I'm not much for special features, so I really did not care nor have a checked to see what this double feature includes.  I just wanted the movies at a great price, and that's what I got.  Have already watched both and had a grand ol' time.  If you enjoy this movie, you'll enjoy Bad Boyz 2.  What...you ain't never seen Bad Boyz 2?!",1374710400,,463,4.337209302325581

4189860,5,B003SXHZFY,"Just wanted to give a heads up to fans of these films that the US blu-ray set which was released in June of 2013 does in fact contain the two films on 2 individual discs with all the special features intact. Widescreen. I got this yesterday and it is awesome. It even has a little flyer inside announcing The World's End, the third film in this ""trilogy"" which is scheduled to hit theatres in August of 2013. Reviews of the inferior Alliance Canadian release have been mixed into this item listing, which is the one everyone's complaining about. Avoid that version and get Universal's to ensure you're getting the real deal. Cornettos for all!",1371081600,50,643,4.649122807017544

4189862,4,B003SXHZFY,"Well the single disc doubled sided DVD set from Alliance DVD entertainment arrived the other day.  The package arrived with English/French directions & short paragraphs on the back explaining what Hot Fuzz & Shaun of the Dead were about.  Now the funny part neither movie is in ""Widescreen Format"" as the back of the box says which is why I gave it only 4 stars.  Their are no extras for either film (fine with me however b.c. really how often does anyone watch that junk anyway ?""  All in all this two pack contains just the films ""Hot Fuzz"" & ""Shaun of the Dead"" in English (no subtitles) an NO EXTRAS.  If your a fan of the films, already know everything about them but whatever reason just never picked them up them buy all means pick up this set here on Amazon.com.  However if you new to the series you may want to buy the seperate for all the extra, better packaging etc... choice is yours but I just wanted the films. Still great set to have an own if you love British humor an comedy.",1338076800,5,993,4.311827956989247
4189863,2,B003SXHZFY,"Two great movies by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, but the DVD not so great.

A cheap double-sided DVD, in a cheap eco case, with the boxart paper printed in two different languages on both sides to save money. They didn't skimp on cutting corners in every possible way, sure there are no advertisements, but that is the only positive.

Hot Fuzz was perfectly fine, Widescreen and everything, but then when I went to watch Shaun on the Dead (The main movie I bought this DVD for) it was in friggin' Letterbox... WTF?!? The DVD box even says widescreen, what a blatant lie.

Also, this DVD is not hearing impaired friendly, no subtitles at all.

This was absolutely pathetic, I will never buy any dvd made by Alliance ever again.",1331251200,7,724,4.546153846153846
