7865588,5,6304226748,"This is a video documentary of the making of the Short Bus Album and the resulting 1 1/2 year tour around the world to promote Short Bus (Filter's hit debut album featuring ""Hey Man Nice Shot). There are some hard to find music videos contained on this video (Hey Man Nice Shot, Dose, and Jurassitol) and a bunch of live concert performances, including ""Hey Man Nice Shot"", ""Dose"", and ""Stuck in Here"" (there are more but I can't remember all of them, but the live scenes comprehensively cover the album). There are also scenes from when Liesgang and Patrick recorded the album in an impromptu studio designed by Patrick and located in a rented Cleveland house. Some great interviews and behind the scenes footage of the making of Short Bus, the selection of the band (including Geno and Frank - they keep changing the drummers!), and highlights of the tour, including, Leisgang getting popped in the mouth with Geno's guitar handle on stage, the boys chucking beer cans out a hotel window in Portugal, and Patrick and Frank getting a tetanus shot (fans of Richie Patrick will particularly like this scene). Great interviews, funny scenes, insight into the band, awesome music, and great performances. Stuff for both diehard Filter fans (whose collection won't be complete without this video), and fans who like good rock music.",1065312000,2,1328,4.906666666666666
