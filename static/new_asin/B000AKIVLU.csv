8078669,5,B000AKIVLU,Wonderful account of New Orleans Voodoo that actually interviews some of the main practitioners in the city.  I think this work does a great job of presenting the real religion from an insider's point of view.  It also does a good job of showing some correlations between Voodoo and Catholicism.  Great documentary on a Beautiful religion in a Wonderful city!,1337644800,3,359,4.95
8078670,5,B000AKIVLU,"This important documentary is finally on DVD.  An inside look at an underground religion in the City the Care Forgot.  This program dispells the myths about Voodoo and follows it's transformation in it's journey from West Africa to Haiti to New Orleans.  Many slaves quickly turned to Catholicism in the New World while secretly clinging to their ancient empowering religion.  A fascinating history.

Many of the people featured in this documentary have passed away.  A short segment in the extra features is dedicated to their memory.",1182124800,7,535,5.162790697674419
