8218639,3,B000VHSOL4,"A principle trait that differentiates us from other animals, our understanding of symbols has influenced us for thousands of years, and many ancient symbols still accompany us today. Keys to the Code explores the origins and meanings behind many timeless visual metaphors, especially those associated with secret societies and organizations. Substituting a concrete image or object for an abstract one began with our cave-dwelling ancestors, and it is with them that scholar Tim Wallace-Murphy begins.
''Many ancient cultures saw art and writing as a form of magic, believing that the depiction of a possibility would make it a reality, such as when writing a spell on papyrus was believed to ensure its fulfillment, or drawing an animal-headed human figure was believed to give a shaman the characteristics of that animal. Later, he delves into more familiar symbols of faith, with particular emphasis on those linked to the Templars and Masonic rites.
''Lecture-like, the DVD is divided into several segments, each an extended interview with Wallace-Murphy on a particular topic. His style is casual yet compelling, friendly yet authoritative as he sits on a rumpled couch and expounds upon each subject. The spartan production values, while preventing any distraction from the subject, seem surprisingly amateurish; even a slight change of camera angle would have added new interest to the proceedings. Additionally, there is little visual spice to accompany the lecture, only the occasional slide of an artifact or symbol interspersed with the taped lecture segments.
''Its flaws aside, Keys to the Code is a unique collection of insights and its simple, accessible presentation grants it a sense of comfortable authority amidst the hype that usually circulates around the mysteries of symbolism.
