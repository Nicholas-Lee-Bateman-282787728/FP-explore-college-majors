8526546,5,B008AYK47M,"The series and the insights provided therein were eye-opening. Truly loved this series, have listened to it many times, and also given it to others. What a blessing. Mangalwadi is also the only Christian speaker that I have heard with a plan to really get America back on its feet through the use of college educations being provided by churches through online video from ivy league schools at a lower cost, thus reducing financial burden on families and educating students with the best teachers while being guided from a Christian perspective. That would be groundbreaking.",1438819200,,575,5.063157894736842
8526547,5,B008AYK47M,"This DVD set is excellent and masterfully put together. The Church and the Nations need what Dr. Vishal Mangalwadi is teaching. I highly recommend his teachings both in DVD and his book, The Book that Made Your World.",1423008000,,217,4.7368421052631575
8526548,5,B008AYK47M,His book and this companion DVD is essential viewing for all who wants to know the impact of the Bible on society. Singapore's high ranking by Transparency International has also to do with the government's freedom for the freedom of Religion.

8526549,5,B008AYK47M,"This DVD is a lecture series at the University of Minnesota that follows the book by the same author: ""The Book that Made your World"".  The book is great, but a long read.  The DVD deals with most topics in the book and does so with a series of 10 lectures of about one hour each.  Ideal for university students and faculty who want an ""outsider"" perspective of Western Civilization.  I have purchased five copies for distribution to student groups and history professors at three universities.",1388102400,2,494,4.709302325581396

He demonstrates how the results of a believing world, and a believer differ from the non-biblical worldview and non-believers and his results astonishing.

8526551,1,B008AYK47M,"I followed Vishal Mangalwadi's career as an evangelical social reformer in India and author for over 25 years.  I supported Mr. Mangalwadi's early work.  Mr. Mangalwadi came to America permanently in 1998 to participate in a conference for Christian International students (""Worldview for World Healing"").  The conference's goal was to inspire and equip students to return to their countries as Christian social reformers.  Shortly after that, Mangalwadi decided to stay in America himself and reform Hollywood by producing documentaries.  His subsequent efforts redound with similar unintentional ironies.

I developed my first doubts about Mangalwadi's credibility when I brought him in as a guest speaker for a separate International Student ministry weekend conference. Hindu, Muslim AND Christian Indians universally objected to his one-sided portrayal of India.  So who was I to believe?  I began to do my own fact checking with respect to Western history. No matter what I read, I consistently found strong evidence of Mangalwadi's biased misrepresentation of secular vs. Christian influences on the West.  Not all opposition merits the crown of martyrdom.  Sometimes people may oppose you simply because you're wrong.

Mangalwadi promotes his ""Must the Sun Set..."" material as a lecture series presented at the University of Minnesota.  In fact, it was sponsored by a Christian organization (MacLaurin Institute) at the U of MN.  This series was not presented as a result of an invitation from any academic department.  Furthermore, the talks are more akin to a preacher delivering an off-the-cuff message vs. an academic lecture.

Any reviewer must first decide what genre to place this work.  The actual lecture titles provide some clue.  ""From Bach to Cobain"", ""From Da Vinci to Dan Brown"", ""From Science to Sorcery"", ""From Paul to Paris Hilton"", ""From Tolerance to Terrorism"" and so on.  Each title emphasizes a slide from some idealized past to the worst of contemporary Western society.  So why didn't Mangalwadi choose titles like, ""From Playboy Composers (Liszt & Mozart) to Billion Dollar Christian Contemporary Music Industry"", ""From Sir Isaac Newton the Arian Alchemist to Dr. Francis Collins the Evangelical Evolutionist"", ""From Puritan Theocracy to Secular Democracy"", ""From Exorcisms to Psychiatry"", or ""From the Inquisition to Tolerance?""  His titles hardly indicate any desire for a ""fair and balanced"" historical perspective.  In fact, throughout the series, Mangalwadi consistently juxtaposes the worst of secular society against the best of Christendom.  It's ironic he so strongly believes Christianity was responsible for logic and science yet in his case, his worldview seems to primarily compel him to argue by anecdote and speculation.

In essence, the worldview presented here is an insular, ill-informed and intensely ideological form of Christianity.  Here's a small sample of some of Mangalwadi's claims throughout this series.  (referenced by lecture number):

 * The West developed a ""uniquely musical civilization"" as a result of the Bible.  Buddhist chanting is not music (but Gregorian chant apparently is).  Islam forbids music (bad news for 7,000+ websites that sell Islamic music).  Religiously pious Bach is representative of the West's musical heritage.  (Liszt and Mozart who carried on like contemporary rock stars are conveniently overlooked.)  The demise of Western musical culture is reflected by suicidal grunge rocker Kurt Cobain (not by the explosive growth of Christian Contemporary Music).  (Lecture 1).

 * You can't have a soul without a God.  If there is no God, you might as well rape and murder. (Secular ethics, social contract theory, and 2,500 years of Buddhist theology all instantly dismissed). (Lecture 1)

 * An economic opportunist like Dan Brown, author of the ""The Da Vinci Code, is representative of the West's slide toward mysticism. Christianity, in contrast, promotes the rational.  (125 million worldwide Pentecostals, with their emphasis on mystical experiences like being ""drunk in the Spirit,"" speaking in tongues, and holy laughter, would disagree with him.) (Lecture 2).

 * ""The West is more interested in witchcraft than science.""  Spiderman is proof of this since he got his superhero powers from psychic sources.  A small boy attempting to imitate a make-believe superhero by attempting to fly is, in fact, ""a sorcerer's apprentice.""  His desire to fly is about ""mind over matter.""  (Marvel Comics has a very clear ""scientific"" explanation for Spiderman's powers.  And exactly how many new grads and jobs each year are in the field of ""witchcraft"" vs. science? These are all elementary facts which even a few minutes of quasi-scholarly due diligence would have uncovered...and to which Mangalwadi seems distressingly indifferent.) (Lecture 3)

 * Freedom is a uniquely biblical idea (Pericles, Socrates, Cicero, Polybius, Saxon democratic ideals, Scottish rationalists...all dismissed).  The roots of democracy didn't come from the Greeks but from Christian Huguenots (whose very survival as a politically disenfranchised group clearly depended on a re-interpretation of explicit theocratic and monarchial political structures endorsed throughout the Bible which other prominent Huguenots advocated.)  The fact that democracy never happened in most European countries until 300+ years AFTER the Reformation (long after its influence had waned) also conveniently ignored.  (Lecture 6).

 * The West has low corruption as measured by the ""Corruption Perception Index"" This is due to biblical influences.  (Depending on who's doing the polling, US citizens are 3-10 times more likely to believe in God and attend church compared to Nordic Europeans yet Nordic countries have the lowest corruption rate overall while the US has one of the highest among Western countries.  (Lecture 7)

 * Tolerance in the West came from Christianity.  There is no secular basis for toleration. (Voltaire and Beccaria used secular arguments to advocate against religiously-inspired intolerance and torture.)  Any Christian intolerance that existed came from the Church's alliance with the Roman Empire and Islamic influence.  (Contributing factors, no doubt, for 17th century Massachusetts Puritans executing Quakers: those American Puritans must have been secret Catholics who read the Koran on the side).  (Lecture 9)

 * Academia's refusal to grant tenure to professors teaching Intelligent Design is proof of the type of inevitable intolerance that happens once Western society forsakes its biblical roots.  (John Scopes being tried and convicted for teaching evolution apparently is not an example of biblically-based ""tolerance"".  Nor are the persistent efforts of evangelical & fundamentalist colleges to require science faculty to teach only theologically approved versions of human origins.)  (Lecture 9)

 * The Bible provides the only basis for equality (...even though it provided the historical rationale for U.S. slave-owners and even today is still used in some mainstream evangelical churches to justify gender-based inequality - e.g., not allowing women to be elders or have any position of leadership over men). (Lecture 10).

 * Minnesota could erupt into such social chaos that even the ""most genuine and sincere liberals would say...the sharia law that would chop off the hands is not that bad.""  How does he know this anarchy is coming?  Three friends had their cars broken into in the past 3 weeks in downtown Minneapolis.  (According to U.S. DOJ statistics, violent crimes nationwide declined 56% from 1993 - 2005.  Another inconvenient fact for any would-be doomsayer.)  More proof the ""sun is setting on the West:"" the recent election of a Muslim, Keith Ellison, to the U.S. Congress.  (Lecture 10).

Mangalwadi does make valid points throughout his series.  I do agree with him, in principle, that ""secular fundamentalist"" have tried to completely exclude religion from public conversation.  But if religionists wish to be included in this conversation, they must be willing to converse in the same language of critical discourse.  Educated reviewers may likely find his reductionistic, mono-causal perspective of Western Civilization to be more insulting than informative and thus make it even harder for more balanced Christians to gain a fair hearing.

After self-producing this series, Mangalwadi approached Connecticut Public TV (CPTV) to see if they would be interested in airing it.  Shortly thereafter, Mangalwadi notified financial supporters that CPTV ""has decided to film and broadcast Vishal's lecture on the Bible as the Soul of Western Civilization. They intend to distribute it to PBS stations throughout the USA.""  (3/6/08 email newsletter).  He used this impending deal as an opportunity to solicit additional funds from supporters.  However, Larry Rifkin, the CPTV Senior Programming Executive denied any forthcoming deal and clearly stated, ""There is NO agreement to do anything but evaluate the material and consider whether it has potential.  Any assertion that we have a deal is simply wrong and, frankly, disturbing."" (4/18/08 personal email).  Compromising on the facts of history can be a slippery slope.  Despite being confronted by a fellow pastor, he still refuses to acknowledge any fundraising improprieties.

This is the final supreme irony in Mangalwadi's thinking.  He continues to argue that the Christian worldview provides an objective absolute moral standard which he conveniently (and perhaps even unknowingly) reinterprets according to the historical contingencies of his subjective experience.  This has been the real history of Christianity around the world over the past 2000 years.  Yet despite all the contrary evidence, Mangalwadi dogmatically insists that he has a transcendent intellectual and moral perspective. It must be a worldview thing.",1341273600,8,9880,5.578629032258065
8526552,4,B008AYK47M,"This is a series of 11 approximately 1 hour long lectures by Vishal Mangalwadi which are based on his book, ""The Book That Made Your World."" Mangalwadi is an Indian born Christian scholar, author and lecturer. He is an excellent teacher and he does a great job of outlining the basic principles of  Judeo-Christian thought by contrasting it with non-western world views such as Hinduism and Buddhism as well as modern secular philosophies developed by Darwin, Freud, Marx and Nietzche, all of which have shaped and continue to shape post-Christian Western culture. He presents his thesis with scholarship, humility and even respect for non-Western and secular ideas even as he points out important differences with the Judeo-Christian view. Mangalwadi never sinks to the level of angry, arrogant culture warrior. He is witty, charming and engaging even as he makes compelling arguments about Western decline.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-that-Made-Your-World-How-the-Bible-Created-the-Soul-of-Western-Civilization/dp/1595553223/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book that Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization</a>",1339718400,10,1199,6.447204968944099
