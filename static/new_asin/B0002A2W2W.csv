2072997,5,B0002A2W2W,"Even though Combat! has aired on some cable stations and has been syndicated on broadcast television in a few markets, I had not seen the series since original broadcasts on ABC ended in 1967.  So it was with great anticipation that I awaited the release of the series on DVD.  The wait was worth it . . . Combat! is even better than I had remembered it to be.  Like many youngsters who grew up in the 1950s/1960s, I was drawn to the show by its combat action sequences and now, as an adult, the human drama is of greater interest.  The writing and acting in this series is top notch and I found the production values to be quite high for a television series from the early/mid 1960s.  Yes, those French villages were really on the back lot of MGM Studios, but they sure looked authentic.  And, although the final season of the series was filmed in color, the black and white film stock used for the first four seasons actually adds to the grittiness of the show.

Season 1, Campaign 2 contains 16 episodes and, like Season 1, Campaign 1, the episodes are shown in production order rather than the original broadcast order.  Shecky Greene's Private Braddock is gone but Jack Hogan's better-known Private Kirby shows up in these episodes.  The extras on Campaign 2 consist of six episode commentaries, and some anecdotal information on each episode provided by Jo Davidsmeyer who runs the Combat! web site.  The commentaries are of variable quality.  For example, actor Joseph Campanella, a guest star on the episode ""The Medal,"" is a somewhat strange choice to provide commentary since his character is killed off during the first quarter of the episode.  Campanella is affectionate when speaking about the show and his role, but he signs off abruptly, around the 25 minute mark of the episode.  Perhaps, with the passage of over 40 years, he simply had run out of things to say.  That's not the case with the other commentaries, however, the best of which come from Director Richard Donner (""No Trumpets, No Drums"") and actors Ben Cooper and Tom Lowell (""Next in Command"").  While certainly not of modern day ""high definition"" television standards, the quality of the audio/visual presentation on these DVDs is, for the most part, very good and likely the best that we'll ever see for this series.

Combat! remains one of television's key dramatic series of the 1960s and is highly recommended to those interested in classic TV and/or World War II dramas.",1091923200,18,2456,4.7435294117647056

2072999,4,B0002A2W2W,"It's easy to slap 5 stars on a Combat review, but one must be careful and realize that this series was 5 seasons long with over 150 total episodes...In fact, if I could give this first season 3 1/2 stars I would....the show was trying to find its' bearings in this first season, and would face many bumps as directors and writers came and went....these are valuable episodes though in setting up what will become the best television series which covered the WWII theater....
Some of the Highlights:
Lost Sheep Lost Shepherd....Jeffery Hunter is the guest star as a priest who fell from grace and is now a tanker...when he blows up the church steeple, you cannot help but think of his role in King of Kings.
Forgotten Front...guest star Albert Paulsen (who recently passed away) portrays a very sympathetic German who is captured by Saunders...the writers had to add the final scene between Caje and Saunders because the producers did not like the final outcome of Paulsen's character...
Cat and Mouse...a very exciting and tense story with Albert Salmi as a Seargent equal to Saunders in grit and determination.
Reunion....what does one do, when you find out your long lost father is a collaborator for the Germans?
The Medal....Frank Gorshin reluctantly, then aggressively, takes credit for a heroic act that he didn't do...
No Time for Pity....one of the many episodes which shows the war's effect on children....
The Sniper....German sniper picks off US soldiers in French town.
No Trumpets No Drums...Caje suffers through a period of angst after killing a little girl's father....
These epsisodes, and others are the high points of the first season...but since the characters have not yet fully evolved, there are some episodes that they are secondary to, at times, rather mundane characters:
Any Second Now....Hanley is caught under some rubble in a church with an unexploded bomb for company...a rather boring subplot between the British demo man and his love interest...
Missing in Action....Howard Duff as a downed pilot is again center stage to a romantic plot line
The Chateau...Doc #1 is given the star treatment in this episode..the problem is that he is not a very good actor
The Prisoner....Shecky Greene's comedic talents are on display but the episode is too ""Hogans Heroes-ish"" to be any good...
The Walking Wounded...this time we have too much Gary Merrill..
Off Limits....William Windom and Peggy Ann Garner are lovers and guess what?...Garner is married to one of Saunders men!...yawn
Well, I could go on but I will spare you....One of the niceties of the first season is that Vic Morrow and Rick Jason worked together in quite a few of the episodes. Future seasons would see them split the center spotlight with Morrow quickly becoming the dominant character...but other characters, like Little John, are barely fleshed out, and Kirby did not have his patented BAR by his side, though in one episode he petitioned to become the squad's BAR man (Far from the Brave)...Stephen Rogers as Doc #1 could not hold an acting candle to Season 2-5 Doc #2, Conlan Carter...
So by all means, pick up this first season because the price is right, and there is much to enjoy....as the seasons progressed, the show just got better, culminating in the 2 part masterpiece, ""Hills are for Heroes"" from season 4....
If I could rate the individual season now they would be:
Season 1 -  3 1/2 Stars
Season 2 -  5 Stars
Season 3 -  5 Stars
Season 4 -  5 Stars...though could be a 6 Star Season
Season 5 -  4 Stars
I'm jumping a bit ahead of the release schedule with these ratings but you have an idea on how I view the arc of the series.
Recommended with some reservations....",1090195200,11,3676,4.828571428571428

I was 8 years old when the premiere episode came on and it was my father's favorite program. He was a WW2 veteran. This program premiered when writers knew how to write and they did not depend on fast cuts and digital images. The stories were very powerful and the acting was great! As a child , I was always waiting for the next episode and now I am happy to see these episodes on DVD. The main stars are dead now, Ric Jason and Vic Morrow and then Dick Peadbody.

With this show you feel like you are there experiencing what our WW2 military must have gone through. Some actual WW2 stock film footage is used at times, but for the most part they use real tanks and other vehicles at the time of filming. Now they need to release the WW2 TV series 12 O'Clock High, which was another great TV series, although not quite as good as Combat.",1306540800,,650,4.2926829268292686
2073024,5,B0002A2W2W,"Every moment of life is precious.  Every lungful of air, every beat of the heart, priceless and limited and worth protecting. Combat is a series that re-affirms how precious life is, and how quickly it can be cut away. While all the episodes in this epic series are spectacular and worth the price of admission, I'll point out one... one of many... that takes the theme to heart. The episode I have in mind is called The Glory Among Men.  Vic Morrow directed it himself.

It takes place in an area that is probably about the size of a football field. The type of area similar to where a lot of the smaller battles of the war were fought , a muddy, filthy area strewn with fallen dead trees, a bleak open expanse of ankle-deep water and a bombed-out fortified wall at one side.  Sergeant Saunders and his men are on reconnaissance looking for where the Germans have dug in.  They come across this small bleak little stretch of land and slowly begin to cross it.  They don't know that a German gunnery crew is watching them from behind the wall with a mounted heavy machine gun aimed at them. When the Americans draw near enough the German Lieutenant gives the command to open fire, and a blanket of bullets rains down on them. Saunders and his men manage to just barely get away from the barrage by ducking behind some fallen logs nearby, but one man wasn't so lucky. His name is Mason, and he was badly injured in the attack.  He is laying in the middle of the expanse , face down groaning in agony, an equal distance away from where his fellow troops lay hidden and where the German guns are positioned.  The Germans could kill him off easily but they don't, they leave him alive and moaning , hoping to use him as bait to lure the hidden Americans into the open for a resuce attempt. Now, here is the catch that makes it even more dramatic.  The wounded soldier is one that everyone in his troop hates. He is a newcomer to the troop, a selfish, self-serving, loud mouthed antagonist who only cares about himself. Some of his fellow soldiers believe he abandonded his post on a prior patrol when the action got too heavy. Needless to say, there aren't a lot of hands going up for men willing to run out there to save him.  What ensues next is a genuine struggle of the heart, as the men who are pinned down by heavy fire try to decide if that man's life is worth almost certain death to try to rescue. After some intense argument among them, two initial attempts are made to resuce him, and both times the soldiers who tried were shot dead in the attempt. It brings the moment to a toppling point. Do they abondon him there, or risk more deaths in yet another resuce attempt?

This is the kind of heavy, intense drama that highlights much of this series. It's less about the war itself, and more about the struggle of the people who are in the midst of it, trying to stay alive and trying to make some sense out of it while trying to do the right thing.

 The disks worked perfectly, the video image quality and audio quality were perfect, and this has what is probably the best designed storage case of any DVD set I've ever purchased, very easy to remove the disks from and to slide them back into, and comes with a paper listing of all the episodes and chapters.

Also this series comes with some great commentary tracks that you can choose to listen to or not.  I especially found the comments by one of the directors , Ted Post, to be very insightful as he discusses the reality of a soldier's life in the war, he being in the war himself.

2073030,5,B0002A2W2W,"Season two of Combat! is an improvement over the previous season. The producers & directors were now on the same page as to what direction the series should take. This makes it more focused & the story lines are tighter. As a child I watched Combat! because it was such an action packed show. The explosions, the bullets flying, the jockeying for position. But Combat! was an excellent drama also. Watching these episodes proves that. There was a lot of focus on the repercussions of war, the human conflict, the triumphs & tragedies. Many times we would get to see some of the inner conflict or the emotional results of what war did to men.

Combat! had many major guest stars in the first season but season two seems to have kicked that up a notch. Some of these include Lee Marvin, James Caan, James Coburn, Eddie Albert, Nick Adams & Richard Basehart. It's sad that the episodes aren't in the order they were originally telecast but that's show business. What is arguably the best episode of Combat! is in this set. ""The Bridge at Chalons"" guest stars Lee Marvin as a demolition expert. The conflict between him & the squad, especially Saunders, gives the show an incredibly suspenseful edge. ""Doughboy"" guest stars Eddie Albert that is something of a stretch but is enjoyable. albert portrays a WWI veteran who has married a French Woman & has remained in France. He seems to have a permanent case of battle fatigue because he keeps having flashbacks. ""Bridgehead"" guest stars Nick Adams as a jazz drummer who doesn't want to be a soldier. ""Masquerade"" features James Coburn as a GI but who is, in reality, a German soldier. Saunders becomes aware that Coburn is not all he appears to be. ""The Party"" is a comedy relief episode that has Kirby in charge. Caje & Nelson are with him as they compete with three American sergeants for the attention of three beautiful French women. ""Anatomy of a Patrol"" is another one of Combat's best episodes. It guest stars James Caan as a German sergeant. Saunders & his squad are sent out to recover the camera from an observation plane that has crashed. A German patrol is sent there for the same reason. What makes this episode so unique is Caan's thoughtful portrayal; he's a soldier that thinks. The episode becomes a contest between Caan & Morrow as to who will out think the other.

There are bonus features on each disc that include audio commentaries on three episodes, ""The Bridge at Chalons"", ""Bridgehead"" & ""Anatomy of a Patrol"" Two interviews are included, one with Vic Morrow & the other with Pierre Jalbert (Caje). The last one contains a lot of insights into Combat! There's also a photo gallery from the location filmings.",1222905600,,2678,4.707889125799573
2073031,4,B0002A2W2W,"This edition of Combat! has 16 episodes &, once again, they're not in broadcast order but in production order. A minor point but it's not quite the way it was. We no longer have Shecky Greene (Pvt. Braddock) but Jack Hogan (Pvt. Kirby) has become more visible in this set. Season one of Combat! had more fluctuation in the supporting cast & that wouldn't become more solidified until the next season.

This set does have one of my favorite episodes, ""The Walking Wounded"". Saunders has received a minor wound that forces him to seek medical attention on his own back at their lines. His wound isn't bad enough to ensure him a ride, hence he's' walking wounded', but he does end up getting a ride on an ambulance. The driver isn't too keen about driving through the combat areas but Saunders takes control. It's a great episode for Vic Morrow. ""Hill 256"" is more drama than action as Pvt. Kirby faces a court martial for cowardice. Jack Hogan gets an opportunity to be the main focus of a script & he proves to be more than adequate as an actor. ""Battle of the Roses"" is one of the oddest episodes of Combat! that has Saunders trying to convince a French woman to leave the sanctity of her garden. ""The Sniper"" is full of some tense moments, the title tells it all. The final episode, ""No Trumpet, No Drums"" was an excellent show for the finale to season one. Caje (Pierre Jalbert) has killed a Frenchman & must deal with the dead man's daughter. Caje is very distraught & becomes distracted from his duty.

Like all the Combat! season sets that are a lot of bonus features. Season one has Steven Rogers portraying the medic, Doc. Rogers would only appear in the first season & would be replaced by Conlan Carter thereafter.

This particular set - Season I Part II has a lot of really great, realistic, well done stories in it.  Great acting, realistic effects and great stories.  You can't go wrong with this great set of DVD's.  Unlike many DVD releases, COMBAT! was done right on DVD - excellent picture quality and sound, and lots of extras.  The picture quality is great especially when you consider these episodes are from the 1960's.  A bargain at the price and free shipping - you just can't beat this deal.

2073038,5,B0002A2W2W,"Landmark television series about WWII (and about the effects of war in general on young men and women). I've tried with various software but can detect no evidence of adjustments in visual or audio tempo except, possibly, in the documentary footage (chiefly in this set of German artillery) which was a thrilling addition to the genre in the 1960s, at a time when most of the war fiction tended towards patriotism, John Wayne, etc.  I am not sure that those discrepancies are not a function of different camera speeds that may have been used bby German documentarists during the war itself. (Could some of these have been hand-cranked, like the old silent movies were??  If so, it might explain the variability in frames per second.)  By the way  I do not at ALL mean to denigrate the traditional American war film genres, which have a beauty (if not a naturalism) all their own. I'm just comparing to what seems to me, looking back 40 years, to be an epochal tv series which still has real 'legs' onscreen today.

 Very moving writing and direction...some of the best  appear in the credits in these episodes.

Vic Morrow's loss was tragic. A fine actor, trained in the classics, one can only wonder whether it'd be, or Brando, who would ultimately have become the icon of this style of character acting.  Both of them were gifts to us. But COMBAT moved the bar in television and film in a way that very few people (NOT including recent docudramas and big-name feature films) have matched -- quiet, personal stories of men and women in hell, redeeming themselves and the world around them.  These DVD reissues are a gift to those of us who love classic t.v., and a testimony, I think, to the integrity of the men and women who engaged this struggle in the 1940s.  I do not mean to romanticize. I just think, now that the videos are out, that this is a really, really exceptional product.  I am so glad that these are available for my kids & grandkids.",1193788800,3,1952,4.593659942363113
2073039,5,B0002A2W2W,"I grew up watching Combat on Sunday mornings. My brother and I would get up early on Sunday morning and watch an episode of The Little Rascals, then The Lone Ranger, then Combat!, and then an old Johny Weismueller Tarzan movie. I was in a pawn shop the other day and could not believe what I saw. The complete second season of Combat. A flood of great memories from my childhood came rushing back to me. After watching TV on Sunday mornings, my brother and I would go out in the woods and reenact the Combat episode we had seen. The woods in Sarasota, Florida were protected at all times from Nazis on Sunday afternoons.

Combat is without question one of the best shows to ever be on television. It is as realistic as can be. Every story is believable, exciting, and you are fully engaged in each and every episode. Of course Sgt. Saunders was my favorite character, he wore the cool camoflagued helmet and his Tommy gun was always at the ready. Rick Jason who played the lieutenant must have been in the military. I am in Iraq now and lietenants have not changed a bit since World War II, maybe even before.

This whole set is great and every episode is action packed. But my two favorite episodes from this set are 'The Doughboy' and 'The Bridge'. In 'The Doughboy', Eddie Albert gueststars as an old shell shocked veteran of World War I. He actually goes through the woods in a World War I doughboy uniform and has a 1903 Springfield Rifle with a two foot bayonette. He captures Sgt Saunders thinking he's a German!

'The Bridge' gueststars one of my all time favorite actors, Lee Marvin. Lee plays Sgt Turk, a demolition engineer who's mission is to blow up a bridge. Sgt Turk and Sgt Saunders do not get along at all, but in the final minute fo the episode, you see how both men have grave respect for each other.

Combat was an awesome show and now that I know it is out on DVD, I am looking forward to buying many more sets.",1193529600,,1932,4.373259052924791
2073040,5,B0002A2W2W,"As a kid, Combat was my favorite show but rewatching these episodes after all these years is much more than just nostalgia. This was an incredibly well produced and acted WWII drama. Each episode is a taut human drama within the context of men under the incredible stress of war. Vic Morrow was amazing in this as tough guy Sgt Saunders and the regulars in the squadron he leads were all good. The guest appearances by a ton of 60's stars and future stars add to the quality. The overall effect of rewatching ths is like rediscovering something of lasting quality. In my opinion TV doesn't get better than this. One more comment - there is so much action packed into each episode that it also reminds me of how many more commercials interrupt programming today. These shows were like mini-movies in the production values and the writing.",1175904000,,837,4.662162162162162

However, these shows have a lot of complexity, and the whole family looks forward to each episode. The plots and characters are usually deep and challenging, even if the writer has to caricature sometimes to develop and resolve a story in 40 minutes.  I really like the use of authentic French and German dialogue; the GIs had to guess-translate as well!  The second set is a little cornier; I attribute it to the actors demanding cameos once the show was successful.

2073050,5,B0002A2W2W,"Vic Morrow and Rick Jason return for a second season of COMBAT!  If you enjoyed the first season, then you will be thoroughly satisfied with the second year of the series.  This was high quality television. As I noted in a review of COMBAT's first season, the show was made at a time when more than 30 one-hour episodes were produced each year.  Compare that accomplishment against the pitiful 22 half-hour episodes available from most contemporary television shows.

Actors and crew worked exceedingly hard to complete these high quality episodes.  In fact, there are so many episodes that shows from the second season, much like the first, are sold in two separate sets.

As with the first set, expect well written stories, great direction, and outstanding battle sequences.  Additionally, COMBAT is chock full of guest stars, as well as up and coming stars in minor roles.

Watching a single episode of this wonderful 1960s series is enough to make you want to run outside and play army again.",1112227200,4,996,4.886904761904762
2073051,5,B0002A2W2W,"The writing, acting, and special effects of this series really exceed expectations for a weekly television program.  On average, Combat was better written and produced than most network TV fare of the day.  At it's best, the program is still capable of bringing a lump to your throat, and the first season episodes did that fairly often.  The second season, immediately recognizable by a change in the opening theme ( and the announcer no longer tells us we're seeing ""Combat! A Selmur Production""), also settles in to spend more effort on developing the individual characters.  In my opinion, Jack Hogan's ""Kirby"" is the first to really strongly emerge, and he provides a good balance to Vic Morrow's Saunders.  Vic Morrow is not in a hurry to develop Saunders during this second season, but the character is becoming clearer.  We are also getting to see Caje and Littlejohn.  Rick Jason's Lieutenant Hanleigh does not seem to get as much airtime as the first season, but Jason carries off the episodes featuring him well enough that we are beginning to recognize his character.  I am really happy Image has finally released this series, as it is the best regular WW II series, ever.  While it does not have the gritty realism of HBO's Band of Brothers, it stands up quite well by comparision.  And keep in mind, that Band of Brothers is true, not entertainment fiction.  Combat is excellent entertainment, well worth the modest cost.  I pre-order as soon as a new season is available.",1111795200,8,1486,4.830039525691699
2073055,5,B0002A2W2W,"Actually, the poster's concern regarding the extra editing of original ""Combat!"" footage is well-founded.  In 1962-63, broadcast standards (voluntarily adhered to by the NBC, CBS, and ABC networks) allowed only six minutes for commercials during each hour of prime-time broadcast, with an additional two minutes allowed for commercials from local affiliates.  Thus, one-hour episodes for TV series were carefully shot and edited by the studio and crew to reflect a 52-minute running time.

However, when ""Combat!"" episodes were syndicated to local TV stations during the 1970's, the restrictions regarding the amount of ads per hour had been loosened.  Thus, local programmers were able to sell 12 minutes of advertising for each hour of broadcast.  The syndicating companies, realizing that local stations would take advantage of the extra commerical time, re-edited the episodes to 46-48 minutes each.  Indeed, it is these re-edited episodes which Image Entertainment, for some reason, has chosen to package in DVD.  (It could be that the 52-minute episodes were melted down, lost, or discarded.)

In any event, ""Combat!"" is one of the great television classics.  Vic Morrow, if memory serves, was nominated an Emmy the same year the show premiered (on ABC, Tuesdays, 6:30-7:30), and I believe the honor was principally based on his performance in the Robert Altman-directed episode, ""Survival,"" in which Morrow's character, Sgt. Saunders, is seriously wounded at the show's outset, but deliriously, miraculously, makes it back to the safety of American lines.  The last five minutes of ""Survival"" are as powerful, in terms of acting, as anything ever witnessed on the small-screen.",1111363200,10,1684,5.467181467181467
2073056,4,B0002A2W2W,"Its nice to see this show again.  Like many I saw it when i was a kid, but i don't recall many details of it.  Seeing it years later I am surprsied by the depth of characters and plot with some of the shows.  The series takes pains to show the human cost and strain of tactical level combat.  In contrast the actual battle sequences, while exciting, are not very realistic.  The Germans are killed off like Keystone Cops, all looking the same and doing the smae stupid things to get killed.

In reality the combat expereince and proficiency of the German squad often far surpassed its Green US counter-part.  Of course what Americans lacked in expereince they often more than made up  with firepower.  This was the saving grace of the US army, its overwhelming firepower.  Of course the show only shows us one little squad of GIs, and it always looks like they are up against the whole German army!  Often this was the other way around, and it was the skill and determination of small German units that held huge, bulky US Forces at bay.  Patton did great when he had gas and was up against rear echelon stuff.  Of course this series was made in more patriotic times, and so the Germans have to look more stupid than they really were. Sometimes there are surprising looks at the Germans as human beings as well!

Vic Morrow of course makes this show.  Without him I doubt it could have lasted as long as it did.  Tanks and equippment are often inaccurate, but the look and feel is still good for the most part.  The best part of this series is often the human interest and character development, away from the shoot-em up combat scenes.  This squad also assumes many roles as commandos too, with guys creeping around slitting German throats with knifes and such.  How come the Germans never get to do this kind of stuff?

Even with its obvious faults, Combat is still worthwhile to see again after many years.  The series does grow on you and pull you into the various characters of the squad.  Try to forget the often hollywood battle scenes and enjoy just the good acting and background atmosphere of this show.",1111190400,4,2113,4.505263157894737

Lots of action and guest stars, Lee Marvin, James Colburn as a german inflitrator, Richard Basehart as a sadistic SS prison commander, James Caen as a german patrol leader.  The episodes that they were in were all excellent.

The doc now played by colan carter is the doc that I remember and all the regulars are there, cage, littlejohn, kirby.  The best episodes in the season 2 mission one in my opinion were the long way home with richard basehart (a two parter), anatomy of a patrol with james caen(excellent move and counter move plot) the two parter what are the bugles blowing for.  In this one the squad deals with british pride and stubborness, well done.  The bridge at Chalons and masquerade with james colburn.  Another enjoyable was the party in which kirby, billy and cage attempt to hook up with three french women.  It was a nice change of pace episode.  The weakest was the infant of prague.

1. Bridge at Chalon - Lee Marvin stars as a demolition expert who is attached to Saunder's squad in order to blow up a bridge..Marvin chews nails in this episode, and we get to see clumsy Little John in action...

2. Doughboy - Eddie Albert is a shell shocked WWI soldier who mistakes Saunders for the HUN

3. Long Way Home - Richard Basehart plays a sadistic German Officer who captures the Squad..Simon Oakland excels in a broken prisoner, who does not want Saunders to make waves...

4. The Wounded Dont Cry - COMBAT tried to be fair and show that there were German soldiers who were humane, and not depict all of them as stereotypically evil, and this episode, regarding a German Medic, illustrates this point...

5. Anatomy of a Patrol - A classic in my opinion, as James Caan plays the Seargent of a German Squad who tries to outwit Saunders...think of how Kirk and Khan played a game of cat and mouse in Star Trek II as well as Robert Mitchum and Kurt Jurgens in the WWII submarine movie The Enemy Below, and you have the comparisons to this episode....

6. What Use are Bugles Blowing For? - A great 2 part episode of a Britsh Squad protecting a Railroad station that will soon be encircled by the Germans...it is up to Saunders to convince the officer to abandon the station...great action and a very good character study of USA and UK soldiers...

7. Gideon's Army - a very poignant episode concerning Saunders squad discovering a concentration camp...very sensitively handled...

Those are are few of the fantastic episodes of the second season, and actually I only can think of one episode that I thought was totally awful. It was called Infant Of Prague and was concerned with a bunch of stupid nuns, who by the end of the episode, you were starting to root agianst them...anyway that's it....enjoy....highly recommended!!!",1100736000,47,2163,4.6587926509186355

2073064,2,B0002A2W2W,"""COMBAT"" was a really great show, but this dvd edition of it is inexcusible. These shows have been edited (time compressed). My question is: Why did Image Entertainment allow this to happen? They didn't do this with I SPY, NAKED CITY, or DICK VAN DYKE. I understand that Image is just a distributor, but they should have DEMANDED that the masters used for these dvd sets be UNEDITED. ""Time Compressed"" is when they digitally edit out several minutes of a program so that they have more time for commercials. What's left after the editing is then digitally ""compressed"" together. These episodes should run approximately 50 minutes, but on these edited dvd's they run about 46 minutes. That means there's over 50 minutes of missing footage in this set!! In the old days, the rule was 5 minutes of commercials for every half-hour of programming (25 min. of show + 5 min. of commercials). Tell-tale signs of a time compressed show are:
The action moves a little faster (moving vehicles will sometimes skip instead of rolling smoothly)
The actors voices are higher pitched
The music is ""choppy"" (try singing while lightly karate chopping your throat--this is what it sounds like to me)

To me, a time compressed show is very annoying. I also feel like i'm being cheated because i'm not getting the COMPLETE versions of these episodes. I would highly advise you to rent these discs before you buy them. (...)",1094083200,41,1402,4.817427385892116
