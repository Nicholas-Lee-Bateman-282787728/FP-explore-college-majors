4461793,4,B004RZXVSC,"As of this writing, have only viewed the first episode in the set, but it definitely upholds the standard for this long-running program. Regrettably, once we finish viewing this set, there are no more.

Downgraded rating to only four stars because this is the first multi-DVD set I've come across which doesn't provide a separate ""snap in"" plastic spindle to hold each individual DVD. Instead, all four DVDs are stacked on a single spindle, and very difficult to release. Plus, if you want to watch the DVD on the bottom you've got to first wrestle the top three off that spindle. Saves the manufacturer a few cents per package at the cost of considerable user frustration.",1351728000,8,673,4.801724137931035
4461794,5,B004RZXVSC,The Daizel and Pascoe set # 11  is as  excellent as all others sets in this series.  It is a crime drama with interesting leading charters and compelling stories  . It is ashamed that it finished. I am happy that the entire series is on DVD and available in Amazon.,1338768000,,265,4.24
4461795,5,B004RZXVSC,"This set, labeled as Series 11, contains the following five episodes from Series 11 and 12 on four disks:
The Cave Woman
Fallen Angel
Demons on Our Shoulders
Project Aphrodite
Under Dark Stars

These are the final episodes of this long-running series, originally broadcast in 2006 and 2007 as Series 11 and 12. These episodes have yet to be released in either the United States or England. Thank goodness we have this issue from the Netherlands. These DVD's contain the original English soundtrack. The optional Nederlands subtitles can be turned off by selecting ""uit"" under the ""Ondertitels"" option on the main menu.

These disks are a Region 2 PAL version. They have not yet been released in the United States in Region 1 NTSC format. YOU MUST HAVE A REGION 2 OR REGION-FREE DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF CONVERTING PAL SIGNAL TO NTSC TO PLAY THE DVD'S SOLD HERE.",1302307200,18,858,4.79054054054054

All of the discs error and I am unable to view any discs.
I have a multi zone dvd player and have many zone 2 dvds which I am able to play without any problem.
This item is faulty and I would like a replacement. When I try to get a refund, a prompt informs me that because I do not live in the U.S , I am unable to have a refund and that no replacement is available on this product. This is not good service.",1392076800,,443,3.723404255319149
