I expected much more overall, better photography ( I have taught photography for 30 years), more substantive information with far less redundancy and techniques/strategies relevant to the various stream conditions found in the park. I have just returned from camping in the Lamar Valley and found this DVD of little help. There are a couple of books that are truly exceptional in it's place...........",1344038400,2,541,5.022222222222222
8550547,4,B00187PHGQ,"The video is good in that is shows portions of a lot of Yellowstone streams, including a number of lesser known streams.  So it satisfies one's curiosity about what those streams looks like.  And of course the scenery is all very good.  It also gives some good advice on how to fly fish different streams.  My only complaint is that the 4 hour length is achieved mostly by a long video of maps at the end of each disk.  You are better off consulting a map or atlas for that, not a video.",1279411200,2,487,4.193548387096774
