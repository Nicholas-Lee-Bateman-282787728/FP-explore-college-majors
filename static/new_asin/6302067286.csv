7820418,4,6302067286,"This story is beautifully filmed in Ireland.  However, it does take some tragic turns, starting out as the story of a young boy who looses many closest to him. He becomes an adult then meets his beautiful cousin and initially, fails to make her his own, although it appears that he loves her. (In between is the Irish revolution and the detested ""Black and Tans"".) The cousins both mature and see the mistakes they have made, with the help of a priest and a former family servant.",1277078400,,480,4.517241379310345
