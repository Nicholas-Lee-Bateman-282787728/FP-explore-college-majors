8050256,5,B0007PENJM,"""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" was a French film, based on the short story by Ambrose Bierce. It won first prize for short subjects at Cannes in 1962 at was sparingly re-edited for the Twilight Zone. It was written and directed by Robert Enrico, it is one of the most memorable episodes shown on the Twilight Zone. It is haunting and brilliant in its conception and its highly original and stylistic presentation. People still remember this one to this day. What can I say here I often wonder after the memorable ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""

I would say the ""The 7th is Made up of Phantoms"" is my absolute favorite episodes. I love the story, the characters and dialogue written by Rod Serling here. Once again I get this feeling of Rod Serling's love for the past and fond memories from our childhood. There are echoes, haunting echoes from the past calling out to the present. Let's take one more ride on that merry-go-round of heroes and glory. The stuff our youth was made up perhaps. Another time another place. Perhaps these men, circa 1964, part of a National Guard mechanized unit out on maneuvers in open country in their Stewart tank near the Little Big Horn will come face to face with the inevitable past and glory. These grown men (Ron Foster, Warren Oates and Randy Boone) will go down in history as they come face to face and encounter the spirits of General Custer's 7th Cavalry and the Sioux nation at Custer's Last Stand. This is a great episode and Warren Oates is just an amazing actor who tries to bring a posture of reason and reality to this episode only to be outdone by the phantoms of the 7th Cavalry. Robert Bray is also excellent as the Captain in charge and Greg Morris as his driver who makes a startling observation at the conclusion of this episode. ""Sergeant William Connors, Trooper Michael McCluskey, and Trooper Richard Langsford, who, on a hot afternoon in June, made a charge over a hill - and never returned. Look for this one under 'P' for phantom, is a historical ledger located in a reading room known as the Twilight Zone.""

""I Am the Night Color Me Black"" was written by Rod Serling and directed by Abner Biberman features Michael Constatine, Paul Fix, George Lindsay, Terry Becker, Ivan Dixon in this tale where the sun fails to come up in a town out west where a man is going to be executed for killing a bigot. Paul Fix is very good as the local newspaperman who is convinced that man to be executed is innocent. Ivan Dixon, the black preacher, delivers words in a sermon on this day. The statement on bigotry and racism is quite clear in this episode.

""The Passerby"" set in the waning days of the Civil War is another somewhat haunting and reflective episode. It is from the third season. It was written by Rod Serling and directed by Eliot Silverstein and features Joanne Linville and James Gregory. A woman watches a tired and battered line of endless soldiers pass by her home and eventually finds exactly what she has been witnessing.",1420675200,,3001,4.584729981378026

8050258,4,B0007PENJM,"This volume of ""'The Twilight Zone' Collector's Edition"" is mostly devoted to the Civil War, with the first and third episodes that are included.  If they had picked ""Still Valley"" they could have had a complete set of Civil War visits to the ""Zone,"" but that is not the case (I doubt they think that far ahead in planning out what goes on what tape).  This tape stands out because it has the rarest of all ""Twilight Zone"" episodes with ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"" which is good, because the other three episodes are average ""Zones"" at best:

Episode 69, ""The Passerby"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired October 6, 1961), is a minor tale in which a Southern woman named Lavinia (Joanne Linville) is waiting for her husband to return form the Civil War, but fears he might be dead. James Gregory plays a sergeant who stops to rest and who figures out ahead of Lavinia, but not ahead of the audience, what the twist is to this one. Then again, any story in which Abraham Lincoln shows up has some redeeming quality. Still, this is an average episode.

Episode 130, ""The 7th is Made up of Phantoms"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired December 6, 1963), a trio of men in a National Guard tank on maneuvers near the Little Big Horn keep coming across signs that ""Custer's Last Stand"" is about to take place. Connors (Ron Foster) and McCluskey (Randy Boone) become convinced they are chasing the past, but Langsford (Warren Oates) believes they are crazy. Then McCluskey is shot in the back with an arrow. This episode harkens back to those days when Custer was still admired.  The episode is also interesting because once they spent money on the tank apparently they could not afford much else, so the attempts to convince us that past and present are coming together are fairly simple and economical.  The rest is okay and ultimately depends on the performances of the actors as they becoming convinced what is happening is really happening.

Episode 142, ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" (Written & directed by Robert Enrico, based on the short story by Ambrose Bierce, First aired February 28, 1964), is actually a French film that was the winner of the Cannes Film Festival of 1962 and which would win the Academy Award in 1963 for Best Short Film.  Several minutes had to be cut and of course Rod Serling provided opening and closing narrations.  During the Civil War a Confederate spy (Roger Jacquet) is about to be executed.  As he is being hung from a railroad bridge the rope breaks.  Dodging bullets he swims for his life and begins a desperate attempt to get home.  This French film worked on American television because it was almost entirely silent and the one brief ballad that is sung is sung in English.  In its final season ""The Twilight Zone"" was over budget and the producers solved the deficit by buying the film rights for $10,000.  Besides, the Bierce short story is perfect for the ""Zone.""  Having this one justifies getting this tape.

Episode 146, ""I am the Night: Color Me Black"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired March 27, 1964), finds Sheriff Charlie Koch (Michael Constantine) presiding over the execution of a man named Jagger. But the night does not end the following morning and it becomes clear that Jagger is innocent, the victim of a corrupt justice system.  The darkness is caused by hate and in this episode Serling gets unbearably preachy: ""A sickness known as hate; not a virus, not a microbe, not a germ--but a sickness nonetheless, highly contagious, deadly in its effects. Don't look for it in the Twilight Zone--look for it in a mirror. Look for it before the light goes out altogether.""  There are more elegant attempts to say the same thing on other episodes that are much more effective.",1125705600,2,3748,4.69618320610687
