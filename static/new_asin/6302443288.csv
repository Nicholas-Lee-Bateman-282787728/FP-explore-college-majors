7825949,4,6302443288,"When this film first aired on USA network in 1991, I was 11 years old, obviously I wasn't ready for it. Having purchased/watched it twice already at 30 1/2 years old, I realize now that the storyline, though not original by todays standards was decently acted, directed, and written, for an action/thriller on cable tv. 7 people all have a history with a mysterious Mr. Osirus, who wants revenge/justice for wronging him. The backstories were simple and easy to figure out, but there is a catchy twist at the end, that you may not see coming. The ""game"" seems simple at first, each person gets 1 million dollars if they ""win"" but this game has a price on their heads,and as each charecter meets their demise, it becomes clear that this Osiris is pretty relentless in his revenge. The biggest shock to me was how graphic the violence was, esp. with two charecters getting shot in the eye! Any complaints? Just one, it should've been five to ten minutes longer, but they ended it rather abrupt, other than that it was good. Anyone who likes revenge stories, might enjoy this, but don't watch it expecting typical action flare, and the film isn't very deep in plot, as revenge plots seem to go, but is it worth a DVD release? definitely!",1310860800,,1234,4.613636363636363
7825950,4,6302443288,"I'm not sure if this was made for cable or direct to video release, but was certainly not releaseed theatrically. That said... this is a great little cheesy action thiller.  Basically another reworking of the classic short story, The Most Dangerous Game with some Ten Little Indians thrown in. Bunch of people are summoned to a mysterious island where they are then hunted by a madman bent on revenge. Gradually (through flashbacks) each tells the tale of why they believe they are being hunted, in hopes of identifying the mystery nemesis they all have in common.  I've seen this on late night TV several times. Great breakneck pacing and suprisingly violent for it's type of cable thriller. Don't know why the other reviewer compares it to Van Damme movies... there is no similarity, intentional or otherwise. But if I had to compare, I would say this is more entertaining and satisfying then all his films combined (with the notable exception of No Retreat No Surrender, of course). And it has Marc Singer, Roddy McD., and Michael Beck (star of The Warriors) all sharing screen time. Anyways, if you can get this cheap or catch it on cable, do so without hesitation.",1140393600,4,1169,4.810945273631841

I don't give it a single star but amazon makes  me put at least one... Just for Roddy McDowall die hard fans",948240000,,283,3.9649122807017543
