665771,4,6303506259,"Rich zoologist Eric Gorman (Lionel Atwill) captures exotic animals for display in an American zoo. Gorman has a wandering wife portrayed by the delectable Kathleen Burke. Gorman takes extreme measures to dispose of the men who take an interest in Burke, and she is always on the prowl. The opening segment of this bizarre little thriller is chilling and gruesome, as one lover has his lying mouth sewn shut. Then the guy is left on his own in the jungles of French Indo-China long enough to become tiger chow. This 1930 movie is an example of pre-code Hollywood when sex and violence were more openly portrayed than in later classic B&W flicks. Gorman is delightfully insane and he is sexually stimulated by violent death. After dispatching of another lover at a zoo fund-raising dinner, Gorman caresses his wife's breast as she laments that death and desire are connected in his twisted psyche. Randolph Scott and Gail Patrick are around as a research scientist and his lab assistant. After Gorman's wife goes to pieces at the alligator pit, Scott discovers an interesting detail that is herpetological in signficance. More violence ensues, and the zoo animals go on the rampage. The climax is crushing if a bit rushed.  Charlie Ruggles provides occasional comic relief. The old film has been nicely restored with clear audio. Fun for collectors. ;-)",1055289600,8,1351,4.977876106194691
665772,4,6303506259,"The acting is marginal, the story is interesting, and suspense good.  The movie opens with a man with his mouth stitched shut (so he'll never tell another lie or kiss another man's wife) and proceeds from there.  The villian is given to melodramatic pauses and leers, but that just adds to the fun.  The PR man provides some good comic relief.

As a side-light, it's interesting to see how zoos used to look.

All in all, a nice little diversion.",1004054400,3,446,4.525

This film can be bought on its own or as part of a 5 discs set exclusive to Universal with limited distribution. While some younger viewers may not really get excited over such films, old Universal Horror fans will certainly remember Lionel Atwill starring in a string of these atmospheric thrillers.

'Murders In The Zoo' is actually pretty good with some surprisingly shocking visuals for the time it was released, most notably are the opening and closing sequences. This film runs just over an hour and is a quick paced thriller for those who enjoy the good old horror days.

The print here looks very good and Universal has included some extras including lots of stills, lobby cards, posters and some on screen trivia about the film. I doubt this film and the four others included on the box set Universal Cult Horror collection will see a general release.",1399420800,3,942,4.668674698795181
665886,4,6303506259,"When rogue sunspot activity grants the chimps at the zoo hyper-intelligence, they quickly rebel against their human captors, forcing the humans to ride tricycles while wearing ill-fitting bell boy outfits and smoking cheap cigars. In an attempt to befriend the chimps, the humans refer to them as mere ""monkeys"" which sends the chimps into a face eating frenzy that transforms the zoo into a cotton candy coated abattoir!

  Okay, maybe not. This is actually a lean and mean tale of obsession and revenge. I don't want to spoil it for you by giving away any details except to say that this type of story, the pathologically jealous husband who views his wife as property, and the brave wife trying to escape him, has been told many times over. This version however, is stripped down and raw, and the zoo setting gives it a slightly bizarre twist, just enough to jar you yet not so much it detracts from  the emotional impact of the story. The acting is good on all sides with Atwill especially frightening as a man both driven and intelligent enough to exact a horrible fate on anyone he even suspects of crossing him. The opening scene is actually pretty disturbing and but does it's job well in that it lets the viewer know exactly how far Atwill will go to impose his retribution.",1390867200,,1283,4.663716814159292

665888,3,6303506259,"MURDERS IN THE ZOO is a 1933 drama (with a few comedic touches, courtesy of Charles Ruggles) starring the brilliantly sinister Lionel Atwill as a world-renowned zoologist who also happens to be a sociopath/loon who will stop at nothing - murder included - to keep his unhappy and unfaithful wife.  After acquiring some very wild and dangerous animals overseas, Atwill's character and his wife return to the States (after Atwill dispatches of one of his wife's admirers), where Atwill - using the animals to kill, leaving little if no evidence - finds himself feeling threatened yet again when a long-term admirer of his wife's makes plans to steal her away.  Ruggles, playing a newspaper man/publicist with a penchant for alcohol, was fairly annoying and unnecessary in the film, to me - but simply for Atwill's menacing and superb performance, if you like old movies especially than this one is worth your time.",1378080000,,912,4.993421052631579

665891,4,6303506259,"Lionel Atwill's name is often included with those of the other horror legends of the 30s, the big, most popular Gruesome Twosome being KARLOFF and LUGOSI, as they were often billed in their films, as well as the also-Hungarian Peter Lorre.  While the majority of the horror films involving the latter three were played deadly serious (no matter how hokey the films really were), most of Atwill's outings emphasized physical comedy over straight out horror, with Exhibit A and B being ""Doctor X"" and ""The Vampire Bat"", both fun films in their own right.  ""Murders in the Zoo"", like ""Doctor X"", has more than its fair helping of slapstick humor courtesy the wise-cracking and comical journalist character, played here by Charles Ruggles.  But this is also Mr. Atwill's most menacing, maniacal role, as a homicidal millionaire animal enthusiast who kills off men whom he catches having an affair with his wife.  After the first lover has his hands tied and his mouth sewn shut and is left to die in the jungle, you'd think she'd learn.  The movie, which was considered a lost film for a long while, looks and sounds excellent, and has some surprisingly violent animal attack scenes.  A disappointment is the absence of any bonus feature or commentary track on the DVD, which options consist of >>PLAY MOVIE<< and nothing else.  For $22 I was hoping for a little something extra, but the movie itself is a found gem that is recommended to all fans of classic horror.",1295308800,4,1462,4.800796812749004
665892,5,6303506259,"Before Hollywood went censor crazy after the mid thirties, the Horror film was having a field day with some of the best most ghoulish product ever to splotch the screen and Director Edward Sutherland's 'MURDERS IN THE ZOO' is about the best of them.  Clocking in at just over 60 minutes, it packs more punch than the 90 minute over done horrors of this generation.  Lionel Atwill at the top of his game plays a Donald Trump of the depression era with one difference, he murders anyone who looks or flirts with his wife , the exotically beautiful Katherine Burke, and since he is a big game hunter who supplies the municipal zoo with animals, he has a field day in committing them right on the premises.  The comic relief supplied by Charles Ruggles is a bit dated and a young Randolph Scott comes off as wooden as Pinocchio but don't let that keep you away from the way ahead of their time sadistic proceedings that follow. The transfer, which is part of the Turner Classic Movies Universal Cult Horror Collection and can be purchased on its own, is beautiful considering the film is over 78 years old and highly recommended to lovers of the golden age of Horror.  Now if they can only release another classic from the same studio and about the same year 'THE ISLAND OF LOST SOULS' which also starred Burke as Lota, the panther woman. WOW! What a double bill that would be.",1289779200,2,1373,4.524193548387097
665893,4,6303506259,"Hey, when we'll have a definitive DVD version of this wonderful Paramount movie, with extras like the marvelous period posters and an audio commentary?",1284163200,,151,5.333333333333333
665894,3,6303506259,"Universal's success with such films as DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN prompted other studios to jump on the horror-genre bandwagon, and among the results was MURDERS IN THE ZOO, released in 1933 by Paramount.  In many respects it is quite a fine film: the story is clever, the production values are quite fine, and the cast is unexpectedly memorable.

The story concerns big game hunter Eric Gorman (Lionell Atwill), who prefers to bring 'em back alive for exhibition, and opens in the wild--where Gorman is seen sewing shut a man's mouth because the man dared attempt to kiss his Gorman's wife Evelyn (Kathleen Brooke.)  Upon their return to the United States, the terrified Evelyn determines to leave Gorman for handsome Roger Hewitt (John Lodge), but Gorman puts two and two together and comes up with murder.

Lionel Atwill was a popular player in shock-and-shudder shows of the 1930s and gives his usual polished performance; although not an outstanding actress, Kathleen Brooke is at least competent and possesses an unusual beauty that is unexpectedly appropriate for a woman captured and held by a game hunter.  John Lodge, who later went on to a successful political career, is memorable as well.  But, a bit oddly, MURDERS IN THE ZOO really rests on the shoulders of its supporting cast: Randolph Scott, Gail Patrick, and Charles Ruggles, who actually receives star billing over Lionel Atwill in spite of appearing in what is essentially a comic-relief role.

Ruggles, who specialized in playing disconcerted eccentrics, is perhaps best recalled for the classic BRINGING UP BABY, and in many respects MURDERS IN THE ZOO is typical of his work in the 1930s: a comic, dithering, and occasionally drunken publicity man hired to boost attendance at the zoo.  Gail Patrick performed memorably in such famous films as MY MAN GODFREY, STAGE DOOR, and MY FAVORITE WIFE, most often cast as an icy and calculating character; here she has a change of pace as the sympathetic Jerry Evans, and she aquits herself quite well.  Randolph Scott would soon become a memorable star of westerns; here, however, we catch him on his way up, cast as Jack Woodford, scientist at the zoo and Gail Patrick's love interest, and he is quite good as well.

But for all the notable or soon-to-be notable names, for all the clever plot ideas, for all its high quality in terms of production, MURDERS IN THE ZOO just never really seems to take off.  To my mind, the problem is the script, which tends to emphasize Charles Ruggles' scatty pressman; Ruggles gives his usual expert performance, but the role doesn't really have anything to do with the plot and the action comes to a screeching halt whenever the camera focuses on Ruggles.  The result, even with a short running time of just over an hour, makes the film seem rather drawn out.

Ultimately, MURDERS IN THE ZOO is a film best left to hardcore fans of 1930s horror who are interested in seeing what studios other than Universal were doing with the genre.  Mildly recommended.

7848993,5,6303506259,"Right from the start, we get the message about Eric Gorman (Lionel Atwill- DOCTOR X, THE VAMPIRE BAT, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM), when he kills off one of his cohorts while on an animal-procuring trip to Asia. It seems the poor sap made the fatal mistake of kissing Gorman's beautiful wife, Evelyn (Kathleen Burke- ISLAND OF LOST SOULS), and wound up beaten, bound, and left to be eaten by tigers! Then, while aboard ship on the way back to his zoo, Gorman leaves his wife alone just long enough -about ten seconds- to fall in love w/ yet another interloper! Gorman gets wise, and fumes all the way home. Upon his return to his menagerie, the ultra-jealous Gorman plots his sadistic revenge, resulting in further murder and mayhem. MURDERS IN THE ZOO features Atwill at his eeevil best, using various creatures, including alligators, and the notorious green mamba to dispatch his unwary victims. Ms. Burke is most memorable for her role in ISLAND OF LOST SOULS, where she played the Panther Woman. Highly recommended for the fear fanatic!...",1461369600,,1041,4.82122905027933
7848994,3,6303506259,"One of my earliest memories is watching this movie; well, not all of the movie I didn't make it past the opening sequence but I have a very clear memory of THAT experience in detail. I only know that I was very young and television was still in black and white. I don't remember if anyone was with me when the Saturday afternoon TV movie started. It must have been someone's last day working at the television station, since the showing of this film at that time of day was a massive blunder. Anyway it starts out pleasant enough an introduction of the time period and location, and nice soothing music. We next see a man kneeling on the ground working with needle and thread. I did not remember what other people were in the shot or what was said.  So there I am, sitting on the couch, minding my own business, watching a pleasant movie. when the person using the needle and thread gets up and walks away. Suddenly another man rises from the ground and runs toward the camera trying to scream with his mouth sewn shut!
The next thing I remember is vacating the room, and my bladder.",1455667200,4,1083,4.388059701492537

Western star Randolph Scott before he became famous is in this one as most Universal movies had young future leading men in many of their
