8420999,5,B004AVREY0,"I've been growingpup watching the famous horror films ""The Entity"" & ""Poltergeist"" with ""Poltergeist"" being the very 1st horror film that I ever did see at age 7 which was quite scary for me at the time, but I still loved it! I saw ""The Entity"" at rather 9 or 10 which was also quite scary for me at the time, but I still loved it! I looked up the Indian actress Hansika Motwani, my favorite Indian actress of all time, and I had found this film, ""Hawa"" (Translation: ""Wind"") on her film history (one of the reasons why I have this movie) and I looked it up on Wikipedia and it said that it's an Indian version of ""The Entity"" (also one of the reasons why I have movie). I just got it in the mail today. I watched it expecting it to be terrible because of all the other foreign rip-offs of American classics I've seen (for example: ""Turkish Star Wars""), but no, it wasn't terrible,  it wasn't excellent, it was in the middle meaning it was okay. I can see that they tried to make a good movie.

For those whove never seen the film or heard of it, its about a 30-something-year-old woman named Sanjana (Tabu, ""Life Of Pi"", ""Haider"") who gets divorced and decides to move to a new beautiful house with her 2 daughters, her oldest daughter Sasha (Hansika Motwani, ""Aabra Ka Daabra"", ""Shaka Laka Boom Boom"") & Kisha (Baby Bhavika, ""Hawa"", ""Zameer"") and younger brother, Vicky (Ralph Macchio's look-alike) (Imran Khan, ""C.I.D."", ""Adaalat""). Sanjana gets attacked a ghost multiple times. Their dog passes away. She tells her friends who don't believe her. Her daughte, Kishar gets kidnapped and Sanjana tries to find her. It's so cheesy, it's good! For of you who love cheesy films, you'd love this!",1438560000,,1693,4.547540983606558
8421000,1,B004AVREY0,"This movie is basically a woman jumping up and down on a bed, pretending to be raped by a ghost. This movie is so cheesy, it should come with pepperonis on top. No boobies. No good acting. No good special effects. This movie is like a turd, it just sat there and stunk.",1357084800,,269,4.09433962264151
