So of course, I had to give this a go.

I'm very glad I did. They had to invent a lot of missing back-story to make a whole movie out of the old cartoons, but that's OK. That part includes some modern-day issues like bullying, by other kids and by the bureaucrats with nothing to lose. It also includes a boy-girl friendship that stops well short of romance. But really, I came for the cockeyed retellings of history and above all for the terrible puns. Those I found in abundance, and enjoyed immensely.

I can't think of a reason to see this again (but that might change 5 or 10 years down the road). Still, I'm glad I saw it.

6185513,4,B00HNGZK6I,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman are beloved cartoon characters, similar to other onscreen duos, including Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, Gumby and Pokey, or Rocky and Bullwinkle.  Speaking of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Mr. Peabody and Sherman debuted and starred in their own segment on The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show beginning in the 1960s  featured prominently in a segment called Peabodys Improbable History.  The father/son pairing would famously travel through time, interacting with some of the worlds most famous individuals, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Jackie Robinson, and Edgar Allan Poe.  And, while the time traveling duo hasn't exactly been completely irrelevant in the modern era of animation  the characters have been in desperate need of a facelift for quite some time, which they adequately receive in their new DreamWorks feature, Mr. Peabody and Sherman.

Directed by Rob Minkoff (The Lion King, The Haunted Mansion), Mr. Peabody and Sherman features the voices of Ty Burrell as Mr. Peabody, a ridiculously smart and accomplished dog that is the adoptive father of a seven-year-old boy, Sherman (Max Charles).  Using his off-the-chart intellect, Mr. Peabody has constructed a time machine, called the WABAC, in order to travel to past points in time to interact with some of historys most important figures  in casual, fun manner that doesnt disrupt time.

Eventually, Sherman must return to school, but when one of his classmates  an intellectually outmatched and jealous girl, Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter), begins bullying him, an incident forces the school principal to contact a Child Services agent, Mrs. Grunion (Allison Janney).  The sour, by the book agent informs Mr. Peabody that she will be visiting their home to determine whether or not she should remove Sherman from his care.  This news prompts Mr. Peabody to invite Penny and her parents, Paul (Stephen Colbert) and Patty (Leslie Mann) over for dinner to rectify the situation.

Once the Petersons arrive, Sherman is forced to spend time with Penny  at which point he divulges that Mr. Peabody has constructed a time machine.  Naturally, she wants to see it and together, Penny and Sherman wind up taking a time through time that quickly garners the attention of Mr. Peabody and leading to all sorts of high jinks as the trio bounce from point to point throughout the past.

Surprisingly, Mr. Peabody and Sherman is a film that both kids and adults can easily enjoy.  This particular animated feature, similar to The LEGO Movie, presents a rather elaborate and supremely thorough plot.  This story not only incorporates a wide range of open adventure and imagination, but it also integrates a great deal of history and historical figures within the spontaneous escapades.  As far as time travel animated flick goes, its hard to image anyone being able to top the limitless boundaries that this particular story conceives.

While the action and adventure steal quite a bit of screen time, the importance of the theme-driven relationship between Mr. Peabody and Sherman also takes center stage.  Initially, these two individuals are present as more of characters bound by a friendship instead of a parent/child dynamic.  Sherman unmistakably cares for Mr. Peabody (who refuses to be referred to as dad or father), yet is also coping with the idea of having a dog as a parent.  Sherman is positively presented as a nerd, but at the same time, he wants to fit in amongst his classmates  which proves to be difficult because he is so much smarter than everyone else.  Enter: Penny, a girl who also wants to be the smartest person in the room.  However, her relationship with Sherman becomes just as important as the father/son connection with Mr. Peabody.

Not only are the characters and plot satisfying, but the quality of the animation is as well.  Mr. Peabody and Sherman provides such appeal to the eyes that its a shame it took so unbelievably long for this film to make it through production.  Even though this feature does pop at you, something tugs at my thoughts forcing me to contemplate that Mr. Peabody and Sherman should have never been put on the big screen and remained strictly as a television series.  Why?  Historical interaction of this nature would be better suited for kids on a regular basis and not every five or six years when a production company manages to get all of their ducks in a row.

Overall, Mr. Peabody and Sherman will make for great fun, full of spontaneity and adventure.  Still, there are subtle differences between these characters and the characters from the original television cartoon.  The relationship between Sherman and Mr. Peabody is far more loving and caring, while their trips through time are far less scatter-brained and well  crazy.  Never the less, this updated facelift will charm the pants off parents while presenting attractive, charismatic characters to the kids.  On top of the non-stop adventure, theres also plenty of slapstick humor and an occasional pun for the mature audience.  The animation is top-notice, and this is one of the rare (and I mean extremely rare) occasions where splurging for a pair of 3D glasses wouldnt be the worst idea in the world.

6185514,5,B00HNGZK6I,"This movie is hilarious, informative, and heartfelt all at the same time! The story is great, the writing is topnotch, the voice cast is excellent!

6185515,5,B00HNGZK6I,"ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS (later THE BULLWINKLE SHOW) originally ran on tv from 1959-1964. Besides featuring the adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and their adversaries Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, the show also included such supporting segments as Dudley Do-Right, Fractured Fairy Tales, and Peabodys Improbable History. After fifty years of sitting in the background and waiting in the wings while Rocky and Bullwinkle and Dudley Do-Right got their turn at the big screen in poor adaptations, the smartest dog in the world, Mr. Peabody and his pal Sherman finally get their turn.

As a nod to the original segments, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN begins with a narration from Mr. Peabody, the worlds smartest dog. He gives a brief biography of his life and then introduces Sherman. In the original segment, Sherman was Peabodys pet. In this day of over political correctness, theres no way that would fly so Sherman has been promoted from being a pet to being Peabodys adopted son. To assist Sherman in his education, Peabody created his greatest invention: the WABAC (pronounced Way Back) Machine. The WABAC is a time machine and Peabody has used it to take Sherman back in time to meet famous figures and watch famous historical events as they unfold. All of this has been in preparation for Shermans first day of school.

Shermans first day of school begins well, but some verbal abuse from a classmate causes him to act completely out of character. Shermans act not only causes Peabody to receive a call from the principal, but it also threatens Peabodys adoption of Sherman. Peabody attempts to make peace by inviting the instigator of the ordeal, a girl named Penny, and her parents over for dinner. Despite her behavior toward him, Sherman is smitten with Penny and one thing leads to another and before you know it, theyve travel to ancient Egypt and get in a jam and Peabody has to be called upon to rescue them. Their voyage home includes a couple of other side trips in Renaissance Italy where they visit Leonardo Da Vinci and ancient Troy on the eve of the Fall of Troy where they meet Agamemnon and Odysseus (who looks nothing at all like you imagine the man being).

Although things have been updated for a modern audience, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is very respectful of the original Peabodys Improbable History segments. For instance, those segments always ended on a bad pun and MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is filled with bad puns. There are references to other movies as well, such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and SPARTACUS.

The movie works on a variety of levels. Sherman really acts and sounds like a seven-year old boy and children will not only be able to relate to him, but will be amused with his antics. Then on the other hand, there is Mr. Peabody who really works as a vicarious figure for the adults. Besides the bad puns, hes full of witty wordplay and makes all kinds of references that children probably won't understand, but that educated adults will. Of course, theres also the occasional base-level joke or visual thrown in that amuses almost everyone, such as seeing the Greeks climb out of the posterior end of the Trojan horse instead of the belly; its a great visual gag.

Die-hard fans of the original segments might have a little difficulty adapting to the vocals of the leads. Ty Burrell does a good job trying to replicate the visual intonations of Bill Scott as Mr. Peabody, but he does sounds different while Max Charles sounds quite different than Walter Tetley. Personally, I wasn't bothered by that, but I know there are some that will be.

Besides honoring the tv segment it is based on, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is just a great movie thats full of heart. Its a story about a father and a son and how their relationship grows and changes. Mr. Peabody has to learn to trust Sherman and let him grow up while Sherman has to find himself, but not forget where he comes from. It is a story that many fathers will relate to and there are a couple of moments in the film that I bet will make many grown men cry (I shed a couple tears).

Although, movie adaptations of tv shows rarely seem to work on the big screen, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is an exception to that. Its an example of a movie that successfully adapts its source material for a modern audience without losing sight of the original material. Its a movie that both newcomers to Mr. Peabody and Sherman and longtime fans can as well as entire families can truly enjoy together.",1394409600,6,4470,4.672172808132148
6185516,4,B00HNGZK6I,"Resurrected from the 60's television show ""The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show"", a brilliant dog named Peaboy and his adopted son Sherman are finally given their grand Hollywood introduction. The question is whether or not 21st century children will take to the two characters that defy convention in every way possible. Not only is Peabody a single parent, but he's a dog; a dog with an intellect that puts most or all humans to shame. Then you have a child, Sherman, who is faced with ridicule from kids that he may be a dog as well since his Dad is.

""Mr. Peaboy & Sherman"" deals with a barrage of issues and information in a rapidly filled short amount of time; adoption, parenthood, bullying, George Washington, ancient Egypt, the Renaissance, the Trojan war, the French Revolution and many other notable figures. Many of the historical references may sail right over the heads of your child depending upon their age. Not to say that your child won't understand what is happening, but the movie moves rapidly and there is zero time spent explaining. So, those who understand the historical references I listed, will enjoy the trip much more than others.

Fortunately the infectious personalities of the characters will be relate-able to all ages. As Peabody and Sherman are preparing to convince a social service worker that Sherman biting a girl at school wasn't the actions of bad parenting or a confused human child who thinks he's a dog, Sherman decides to defy Peabody and show his new pseudo friend Penny their time travel machine 'the WABAC'. This is where 60's Peabody and Sherman get to do something they never could do before; 3D. There is no question in my mind that ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" is a much better experience in 3D. Not only are the time travel sequences ones that make you sway in your seat, but the frequent poking and jabbing of swords into your nose from multiple time periods is pretty effective.

The movie is a whole lot of fun, but that will vary depending upon age and intelligence. The movie moves very fast and younger children may not understand time travel or why the characters are significant in the least. Despite that though, the one thing that puts ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" over-the-top is the themes that carry over the film; parenthood, forgiveness and presumption. Just because somebody's parent is a dog doesn't mean that they are gonna bite, and just because you may dislike somebody doesn't mean that's always going to be the case.",1394409600,9,2476,4.807511737089202
6185517,4,B00HNGZK6I,"The 1960's black and white cartoon ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" makes the quantum leap to gorgeously life-like 21st Century animation in this very well done update. Mr. Peabody the dog is still a genius inventor, but Sherman is now his adopted son. Sherman is also school-age, which will be the immediate source of their adventures and misadventures.

Sherman's first day of school goes badly. An encounter with mean little classmate Penny Peterson leads to a fight and threats from the terrifying child services agent Ms. Grunion. Mr. Peabody invites the Petersons over for dinner to reconcile, but Penny baits Sherman into an unauthorized use of the WABAC machine. The resulting chaos will require trips to ancient Egypt, Medieval Florence, Homer's Troy, and Revolutionary France to sort out. The dramatic conclusion will require Mr. Peabody and Sherman's best teamwork to fix the space-time continuum.

The animation is extremely well-done. The storyline and the continuous action will appeal to children, along with a nicely considerate moral message. The presentation is loaded with sight gags and references to the older cartoon that should entertain the adults in the audience. Highly recommended.",1394323200,,1201,5.382978723404255
6185518,3,B00HNGZK6I,"Jay Ward and Bill Scott's beloved cartoons have had Rocky history on film. Such frequent fractured tales as Dudley Do-Right (2010), Boris & Natasha (1992), George of the Jungle (1997), and of course 2000's near-legendary film flop ""The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle"" all sought to bring the original's clever wordplay, satire, and unforgettable characters to new audiences. The problem was making these characters, built for close viewing and listening on early 1960s television, into a larger time (film-length) and space (full screen) continuum.

Not unlike what Mr. Peabody and Sherman face in the latest and most(ly) successful attempt to revive these classics. ""Peabody's Improbable History"" was a five-minute episode arc in the original Rocky & His Friends show where Peabody (exceptionally intelligent talking dog) joined Sherman (remarkably nave, sweet pet boy) traveled in the WABAC machine (a large red globe for this film) to visit and often rescue famous historical figures, get out of a nearly impossible jam, and end with a cringeworthy pun. (Personal note: This was the part of the original Bullwinkle show I enjoyed most, which contributed to my love of history, poetry, and wordplay which continues to this day.)

The film respects the original's history (especially its first episode) but places it in larger context for the big screen. Peabody (voiced appropriately by Ty Burrell, who approximates Bill Scott's original clipped accent)& Sherman are now father and son (a tribute to blended families). Sherman is shown at school in feisty relationships with a young classmate Penny, while Peabody battles/dazzles Penny's parents (one voiced by Steve Colbert) and a child service worker who wonders how any dog should be able to adopt a boy.

Along the way Peabody, Sherman, and Penny visit ancient Egypt with King Tut, Renaissance Italy with Da Vinci, and the Trojan War (a sequence featuring the hilarious Patrick Warburton) making escapes worthy of and referencing ""300,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" All while Sherman tries to establish his own identity as a boy (with Penny's prodding) and Peabody rescues them both in time for a quick escape and quicker pun.

Saving these characters for 2014 means fun cameos by more modern historical figures, plus a somewhat sentimental middle sequence and ending zany co-creators Ward, Scott, and Ted Key might not have stomached. (Key created ""Peabody"" with his friend Ward while drawing and adapting ""Hazel"" for TV.) Also, the film misses the comforting touch of Peabody not narrating the action, as he did on the original cartoons. That said, Dreamworks (which has rights to the Ward characters after they passed from Disney and Universal) is the right home for ""Peabody"" and future Ward-based films; they understand the original's subversive, satirical tone. (Besides, the ""Shrek"" films were basically ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" on steroids anyway.)  Young children and fans of the original ""Rocky & His Friends"" series will leave with fond regard, if not total love, of this update.",1394323200,12,3063,5.281314168377824
6185519,5,B00HNGZK6I,"First of all, this was the only animated film this year that looked completely great from the 2014 trailers.  And, my God!, was the movie a masterpiece.  Many have said the movie's plot is convoluted by trying to shove in too many famous people from history, but the amount of historical characters while large are spread it out and each character serves a purpose in the plot. Dreamworks animation, as you would expect, is perfect.  The character designs are creative and not to the point were it looks too real.  It looks very cartoony and it really works in the wacky world they're creating; the background is even better - giving out something very colorful with loads of details. The characters are Dreamworks best collection since Bee Movie and/or The Prince of Egypt; all of them are well developed and written.  They work perfectly together. They only word the can describe Mr. Peabody and Sherman is perfection.  I have never been more pleased with an animated film meeting my expectations since Rise of The Guardians (another Dreamworks masterpiece.)

So keep up your perfect work Dreamworks!!! and go watch this film right now!",1394236800,5,1138,4.895833333333333
6185520,5,B00HNGZK6I,"This movie is completely brilliant; take your kids to see it, you wont' be sorry! It is clever, hilarious, and so touching at the same time. Taking my kids to the theater today to see it was the most fun we've had in SUCH a long time...",1394150400,5,236,4.042553191489362
6185521,5,B00HNGZK6I,"My daughters liked this film a lot and me I found it entertaining, clever and VERY amusing, especially the fragments in which discreet jokes for adults were included, like the wonderful cameos by Kirk Douglas and Bill Clinton (I lost half of my popcorn because of the latter). Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The character of Mr Peabody appeared first on ""Rocky and Bullwinkle show"" in the late 50s, before starring in its own TV series, ""Peabody's Improbable History"" in the 60s. Those series told about famous characters from the past being visited by a dog named Mr Peabody (world's greatest genius) and his pet boy Sherman. This film is a highly modernized version of this latter show.

Unlike in the series, Mr Peabody walks mostly on two legs, treats Sherman as his son and not as a pet and is also much funnier and more likeable - in the old series Mr Peabody was a colder, more distant, more cynical character. In the series Sherman was slightly dim - in the film however he is just a regular 7-years old boy, may be just more enthusiastic, cheerful and kind-hearted than most.

Raised by a highly civilized and peace-loving father, Sherman is a very gentle child - which, once he starts school makes him an ideal target for the the alpha bully in his class, the abominable Penny Peterson, a girl cute as a button, spoiled like month old steak, mischievous like a cohort of leprechauns and as mean as a rattlesnake...))) One thing leading to another, poor Mr Peabody is forced into peace talks with Penny's parents and tries to reconcile the two kids - and at that moment the REAL troubles begin...

As I already said, this is a delightful film, both for children and for adults. Children oriented fun is of course the main treat, but adults will also find a lot in this film, like some short lessons on followic topics:

""Definition of smell of victory in Bronze Age"" by Agamemnon

""Comparative value of currency in American mating rituals"" by George Washington and Benjamin Franklin

""Female sense of humour in Italian Renaissance"" by Mona Lisa

""Everything you always wanted to know about eviscerating princesses but were afraid to ask"" by King Tut

""Basic headology"" by Robespierre

""Solving father issues with genocide"" musical presentaiton by Greater Ajax (featuring The Achaeans)

""Pizza and ancient fortifications - analysis of a duality"" by Ulysses

""Dog day afternoon - an earful"" by Van Gogh

""Reflection on emptiness and fulfillment of timber"" by Trojan Horse

""Raising a child - a dendrological new take on an old problem"" by Leonardo Da Vinci

""Taming of a shrew - case study"" by Sherman

But all of this is nothing compared to, sorry for repeating it once again, cameos by Kirk Douglas and Bill Clinton. Your children in principle will not understand them - but in the theatre where I saw this film the adults almost rolled on the floor at those moments...)))

6185750,5,B00HNGZK6I,"So I went to see this with not much expectation at all, the one trailer I had seen didn't really grab me but I decided to see it anyway and was pleasantly surprised. Mr.
Peabody is this extremely intelligent dog who can talk and his adopted son Sherman is a 7-year-old boy who is a sponge for facts but quite slow practically. They go on adventures through time to learn about history. The movie sets that up in the first 15 minutes, which by the way it was done it looked like the movie was going to be some kids documentary about history but when it actually got into the story it was really fun. The comedy made me laugh, the visuals are stunning, I wish I could've seen it in 3D, the story is quite unique but also had similar elements of other movies, I got a Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure vibe and you get some pretty generic characters that you've seen in quite a lot of animated movies but the plot was't boring; I was interested to the end. The voice acting is pretty average but the way Mr. Peabody says things do add a certain something to the film.",1474243200,2,1063,4.241379310344827

 Mr. Peabody is a professorial talking dog.  Sherman is either his student or his pet, we never quite understand their exact relationship.  This kids flick provides some solid history lessons for the wee ones.  The scholarly pair uses the Wayback Machine to visit scenes of historical import.  They also manage to get into trouble along the way.

6185793,5,B00HNGZK6I,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!! I had a BluRay of this before.  Mostly bought this because my original lacked bonus features. The movie itself Is a wonderful tribute to the classic Sherman and Peabody shorts. They did change a few things since they are updating Sherman and Peabody for a new generation as well as trying to make a feature-length film. It focuses alot more on the father/son relationship between everyone's favorite dog and his boy than the shorts ever did, which is cool. The Waybac also gets an incredible upgrade, going from a simple door portal to a spherical red time-ship. There are also many more characters introduced, including Penny Peterson and family and The evil CPA social worker Ms. Grunion, along side historical figures such as Robespierre, Marie Antoinette, Leonardo De Vinci, King Tut, and Agememnon. Plus, the music is done by Danny Elfman, aside from John Lennon's Beautiful Boy and Grizfolk's Way back When. Both of which are WONDERFUL songs.

As for bonus features, there are quite a few great ones, including the premiere Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends episode where Mr. Peabody and Sherman got their start. Then there is a featurette that traces the history of Mr. Peabody and Sherman from the 50s-60s shorts to The 2014 movie. There's also a tour of the Waybac hosted by Mr. Peabody (Ty Barrell), A featurette discussing the possibility and science of Time Travel, a funny look on Mr. Peabody and Sherman's mark on history, The hand and feet ceremony at the Mr. Peabody and Sherman premiere at the Chinese theater in Hollywood featuring appearences by other famous canines in TV and cinema, a memory game and jigsaw puzzle game, the theatrical trailer, and more. It also comes with a handy digital copy for Ultraviolet or Itunes.

6185823,3,B00HNGZK6I,"The previews made this look like it would be fun for both the kids and adults.  Theres a lot of slapstick and novelty for kids and some fun moments for adults but unfortunately they turned out to be few and far between.  The time travel elements are likely going to be lost on the younger kids, which is toward whom this movie is ultimately aimed.  The subtext of this story, that we should accept the seemingly odd/ backwards because it can be good (a dog adopts and raises a boy) is both superfluous because Mr. Peabody is the smartest intellect in the films world but also ad hoc without dealing seriously with the very reality it presents (a dog cant be the smartest intellect in reality).  Kids aren't going to get this, but they're likely to get the subtext anyway.  The films not subtle.  Thats too bad because this film had potential and it certainly has a good adoption message.  Fans of the old cartoon may wax nostalgic for all of a few moments before realizing that we can try to go back in time but history will always stifle us with the present.  Decent extras on the disc, including some old cartoons.",1467504000,,1116,4.463054187192118

6186007,1,B00HNGZK6I,"Nobody in our family was amused by this movie. We wanted to turn it off, probably less than ten minutes in, but decided to give it a chance. Nothing but crass ""humor"" and tiresome puns. Destroys the original cartoon, which I remember to be a nice balance between entertaining and educational. And while Sherman was a tad goofy in it, was he *this* freaking annoying and incompetent?! Every single character is utterly unlikable in this adaptation.

Take Penny, for example. She's a terrible, selfish, cruel little girl (apparently only seven-years-old!) who thinks nothing at the offered torture and murder of Sherman and Peabody. ""Skinned alive to be eaten by ants? Ooh, how flattering!"" But guess what? Sherman has a crush on her! Oh, but of course! She's ""pretty""! And Sherman, also just seven, already thinks with his penis. We'll just ignore what a sadistic tw*t she is. Der-hur... Throughout the movie she manipulates Sherman into doing her bidding. Such as stealing and subsequently destroying da Vinci's flying machine (isn't grand larceny just *so* totally amusing?!). After manipulating him into stealing the Wayback in the first place, right after Peabody explicitly told him not to mention it. Stupid, stupid, stupid boy.

Needless to say, the beyond banal ending fails to be a saving grace for the characters, the movie, or the hack writers of this flop.",1450569600,2,1367,5.071111111111111

6186195,3,B00HNGZK6I,"I thought it was trouble when they announced the movie.  How do you take a four to five minute segment and turned it into a full-fledged movie?  It just wouldnt work, right?  Still, I heard some good things about Mr. Peabody & Sherman and decided a rental would be a great way to find out what the movie was all about.  It worked better than I thought it would, but not rushing out to see it was wise on my part.

For those who don't know the original source material, Peabodys Improbable History was a segment on the old Rocky and Bullwinkle show from the 1960s.  But you don't need to know much about it because the movie starts off introducing us to Mr. Peabody (voiced by Ty Burrell), the worlds smartest dog who adopts Sherman (Max Charles) as a baby.  This leads to his greatest invention, the WABAC machine, which he and Sherman use to experience history.  Of course, history doesnt always start out the way we all know, and at times Peabody has to nudge it in the right direction.

But our story really picks up on Shermans first day of school.  He runs afoul of Penny Peterson (Ariel Winter), and winds up biting her.  With the authorities now thinking that Mr. Peabody isn't fit to raise a boy, everything the two love might fall apart.  So Peabody invites the girl and her family over for dinner.  However, Penny isn't willing to stop goading Sherman until he finally reveals the truth about the WABAC machine.  Soon, Penny, Sherman, and Mr. Peabody are racing through time trying to get home safely.  Can they do it?

The plot works to give us several fun historical stops over the course of the movie including ancient Egypt and Greece as well as a visit to Leonardo da Vinci.  As always, I enjoyed these, especially since they still managed to work in Peabodys groan inducing puns.

Now, I get they need to figure out a way to stitch these segments together.  However, Im not sure this particular story was the way to go.  It felt too forced and heavy handed to me.  Plus the attempts to develop Peabody and Sherman as characters felt too contrived.  Maybe its because Im used to them being fairly flat over the course of all those segments from the show.  Its not that they are bad characters, but they are more straight men for the antics of the wacky historical figures.  To see them treated as more serious characters just felt wrong.

The computer animation is highly stylized, but its fun.  This isn't the realistic animation you will see other places, but it never gets in the way of the story.

The voice cast is great at bring their characters to life.  I have to give special praise to the leads who did a wonderful job capturing the voices of their characters from the TV show.  After the first minute, I felt like I was listening to the original actors.

I think those who aren't familiar with the originals would really enjoy Mr. Peabody & Sherman.  Those who are used to the shorts will probably feel like I do  the movie works, but these characters were better in smaller doses.",1435104000,3,3007,4.490774907749078

I grew up with Mr Peabody & Sherman his pet boy and this is a wonderful truly awesome and inspired take off on that rather odd relationship. Watch this with tissues handy because; you will cry at some points.  You will also laugh often the puns just keep coming and few if any fall flat. If I have only one gripe about this movie it is that the awesome movie is just not long enough. I got this movie to fill my cart based on some good reviews.  I was not really thinking this movie about a cartoon dog and boy would be too good.

This remake was awesome. I won't go into what happened in the movie so there will be no spoilers at all.  This movie is just too good to ruin it by revealing anything about it. I loved the schematic of the original wayback machine inscribed on the bulkheads near the door to the futuristic wayback chamber. It was careful nods to the cartoon series that really made the new version come to life.  The new Mr. Peabody is a little more human in the most dog gone ways. Oops did I just make a pun, excuse me. I didn't get it!

Anyway you owe it to yourself to have this movie, my collection would not be complete without it.  There are rare movies that I love so much that I buy a spare or tow just to make sure I am never without them. This Mr. Peabody & Sherman Movie is a movie I must have duplicates of in my collection. It is rare that I like a movie this much but watching this Mr. Peabody & Sherman movie made me feel like a kid again.  I laughed and cried in the carefree ways I used to in childhood. Watching this movie was just a pure tonic to my heart a blessing beyond words. To have such an awesome experience for the few dollars this movie cost me is one of the best returns on investment I have ever experienced in life. Few things I purchased in life have brought me the joy I had watching this movie.  On a 65 inch screen the movie was simply smashing fun to watch.",1434844800,,1986,4.043367346938775

I thought this movie was just very adorable. The plot was engaging, and I liked how Sherman wasn't always doing the right thing. I did think, however, that the kids were too mature for seven-year-olds. Penny's lines sounded unnatural at times, as well.

6186237,5,B00HNGZK6I,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. It may sound weird, since it obviously has nothing in common with other great masterpieces like Citizen Kane. It is, after all, a goofy comedy with cartoony animation. It might be impossible to argue my opinion to anyone who doesnt enjoy this kind of movie, but Mr. Peabody and Sherman really hit all the right notes for me. And just to emphasize my point Im a real DreamWorks fan who already expected this movie to be good, and I was still blown away!

Mr. Peabody and Sherman is based on a show-segment from the original Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons. Suffice to say, I am not terribly familiar with this series and I know changes were made during its adaptation. The basic premise revolves around a dog named Mr. Peabody who sadly wasn't adopted as a puppy, but grew up to instead use his massive intelligence to become a noble contributor to society. He is wonderfully brilliant, but also one of the few geniuses in animation who also has a loving heart. A heart so good in fact that he even adopts an abandoned orphan named Sherman and raised him with everything a good father could provide. Among which is a time machine called the WABAC which they use to go back in time to have adventures and see history in the making.

The father-son relationship between this rather mixed-matched couple really comes across as heartwarming and not creepy, because both main characters fill the roles wonderfully with genuine love and compassion between them. However, there are skeptics in this movie who believe a dog shouldnt be able to adopt and raise a boy. Such is the case during Shermans first day at school, when he gets into a fight with a bossy girl named Penny which arises the suspicions of the Childrens Service Agency. Mr. Peabody intends to host a formal party to prove himself a good parent, but after inviting Penny to his house Sherman irresponsibly shows her the WABAC and begins an awkward, crazy adventure to bring her back and avoid any number of time-travel problems they are likely to create.

The movie is a real character-driven story, which you probably wouldnt expect from the trailer alone. This movie is intended to be quick and snappy for younger viewers who want fast paced slapstick humor. Most other kids movies of that sort are usually dull because they fail to incorporate any kind of intelligence or passion, but Mr. Peabody and Sherman really surprised me. It is a genuinely funny movie with good jokes, good timing, plenty of wit and lots of roller coaster action. Adults can genuinely enjoy the ride, especially when they find certain jokes included just for them. A certain joke about Bill Clinton really caught me off guard laughing.

The more important point I want to make about Mr. Peabody and Sherman, is that this is one of the most honest and sincere childrens movies Ive ever watched about father-son relationships. There is an extremely thick plot about Sherman learning how to rebel against his father and stumbling along the way. Mr. Peabody also realizes how hard it is to let his son do things on his own, but doesnt stop loving him. The movies pace somehow manages to slow down during those tender, emotional moments and make us genuinely care for the characters who are troubled and hurting. Penny also starts the movie as kind of annoying, as shes supposed to be, but she grows and matures over time and somehow becomes part of the gang, even though she wasn't from the original shorts.

Mr. Peabody and Sherman is even better than just another character-driven story because it is also a relatable movie thats all heart and soul. Going into detail why is difficult to explain because you just have to see it. When you do you really become more and more attached to each character until you just want the story to keep going on forever. Part of the reason this works is because of several sappy cliches that were nicely avoided, such as the misunderstanding moment and the fathers confession moment. None of this distracts either from a very exciting story about perilous time-traveling that takes Mr. Peabody and Sherman from one historical place to another and getting them into deeper and deeper trouble. There was only one part in this movie where the time-traveling was threatening to get overly complicated, but thankfully it didn't go down that path.

Its kind of hard to describe how a movie like Mr. Peabody and Sherman could be so great when it doesnt resemble the other animation greats. But heart and soul is exactly what this movie is bursting with. Passion for the original animated shorts, and determination to make something a new generation of kids would love. Mr. Peabody and Sherman is kind of an underdog classic, but something that I believe will endure. It is, indeed, a great movie that I love very much.",1433030400,,4857,4.721698113207547

6186297,5,B00HNGZK6I,"As far as animated movies go, this one is pretty great. I purposely watched all the Rocky and Bullwinkle shorts of Peabody's Improbable History before watching this film to see how well they were adapted. Frequently movies based off of something else get the original all mixed up but this one did a commendable job.

The voice acting was great. Ty Burrell does a particularly good job as he clearly did his homework and thus sounds very much like the original Peabody in the shorts dignified voice, broken up but well articulated phrases, etc. He can seem a little awkward at times but that's probably because I am so used to hearing his voice as Phil on Modern Family. Max Charles does a nice job with Sherman- his voice fits the character's appearance nicely. Although he doesn't really sound like the original Sherman, I didn't really like the original Sherman anyways because he sounded like a typical kid from the cartoons in the 50s/60s. He puts a good spin on it.

They also did good job of incorporating as many stops in history made by the original characters as possible, which is not an easy task seeing that there were 91 episodes of the shorts all of which centered around a different person or event. The few things that were missing from this adaptation that I wish had been incorporated were 1) Mr. Peabody's narration (although he does do a little bit of this at the very beginning of the film)... I understand why they did not include this because Peabody's narration in the shorts were used mostly to connect events that were not shown due to time, like traveling from one scene to another. Therefore, the rest of the narration that is in the shorts, consisting mostly of ""Sherman was right"" or ""Sherman's keen eye noticed this"" and ""as usual, my ingenious invention the WABAC performed flawlessly""  would not have made sense to put in the film either. 2) The WABAC was a flying red orb in the film which is very different than the shorts where it is like an old school computer on a wall attached to a door that they walked through to be ""transported"" back in time, ending up right on the scene where they intended to be. The WABAC was also right in there in the living room. Peabody would always have Sherman set it to a certain date and time which I liked but here Peabody does it all for him. Again, understandable why they made it a flying object but the door and Sherman setting the time were a big piece of the episodes. 3) In the shorts, Peabody says he adopted Sherman because after all he had accomplished, he realized that he was lonely and therefore sets out to adopt a boy. I like the acknowledgement of loneliness and how our accomplishments mean more when you have someone to share them with. Similarly, Peabody says that he invented the WABAC because, after adopting Sherman, he realized that a penthouse apartment was not enough space for a young boy as they love to run around and go wild. Peabody also explains that the first go-round using the WABAC he realized that Sherman couldn't understand what was being said in all the different languages so Peabody alters it so that Sherman could understand whatever was being said regardless of the language. The second time they used it, they realize that they cannot interact with the people in history and therefore Peabody adjusts it once again so that they can do this. I thought these explanations were unique and shows trial and error. 4) I quite enjoyed the premise of the shorts where Peabody and Sherman would go back to just sightsee and learn but end up needing to solve a dilemma of the figure they were visiting as the dilemma, if not fixed, would cause that figure not to do what he/she is known for in history. In the film, the main cause for needing to fix things is Sherman's mistakes which is not how it works in the shorts at all. The film does have a good example of helping a historical figure when they visit DaVinci but still would have been neat to incorporate that more. AND they went to the French Revolution in the shorts but didn't focus on Marie Antoinette but rather Louis XVI and the storming of the Bastille. 5) By the end of the film, everybody who's anybody knows about the WABAC which I liked to think of as a special thing between Sherman and Peabody

HOWEVER, these are rather forgivable discrepancies due to the things that they changed that I did like. 1) Seeing that the shorts were made in the 50s/60s, some of them were incredibly racist and stereotypical. The film does not do this. 2) In the shorts, Sherman was adopted by Peabody as a seven-year-old boy found being picked on by bullies whereas in the film Peabody finds Sherman as a baby who is abandoned and lonely just like Peabody whose purpose of adopting a boy was not to be lonely anymore. 3) In the shorts, Sherman is Peabody's PET. I get it, it's ironic, it's funny, whatever but it was just strange. He literally treated him like a pet and had seemed to only show concern for Sherman when he got lost. Although it was kind of awkward for me at first, I LOVED that Sherman was treated as a human being because that's what Peabody acts as. They actually have a relationship which allows for you to see Peabody not as a funny but smart/stuck-up egotistical character as he is portrayed in the shorts but as a character who has feelings and emotions which act as his biggest obstacle in the film (in the shorts he really only had the obstacle of dumbed down historical figures to deal with). You can tell that this is really the first time Peabody has ever had to acknowledge and actively think about his emotions, particularly towards someone else. He is so used to dealing with formulas and facts and figures that when it comes to the point in Sherman's life where he is at the age that kids start discovering and expressing their own emotions and individual personhood, Peabody begins to realize he must confront this as well in order to be a good dad. This translates from the shorts in the sense that Peabody is rather cold towards Sherman in these adventures but the film rights the wrong of Peabody never really adapting to having someone else around that he truly cares about. Out of all the directions this film could of gone as far as developing Peabody as an actual character (which the shorts don't really provide time to do beyond his awesome puns and intelligence), this one hit the nail right on the head. 4) Due to the shorts only being five minutes, there is little time to explore the character of the two's relationship. The film really gets at this, asking the question the begs to be answered: how does Sherman feel about being raised by a dog? Even if Sherman wasn't his son in the shorts, he was still being cared for by a dog which has got to be a little strange. I love how they resolve this issue. Plus, the shorts don't show how Sherman has benefited from being in Mr. Peabody's care where as the movie really does do this. While watching the shorts I frequently would be confused as to why, after living with a genius for so long, Sherman still make stupid remarks or be portrayed as a dummy. The film rights this wrong by showing that Sherman has really benefited from living with Peabody (he's really smart, particularly when it comes to History) just as Peabody ultimately realizes that Sherman's presence has been beneficial to him by helping him accept that emotions and relationships are just as important as formulas.

Overall, a great movie. Original, freshly cut, easy to follow and has lots to offer including well-done animation. I mean, how many family/animated movies actually show a little bit of history to the kids that are watching them? Great use of a film as a plug for being educated. I rarely cry at movies and I was on the brink at several points in this one (some of these were times were due to laughter). Sorry for the long review but I really enjoyed this movie and have been thinking about it all day (watched it last night) and needed to break it down somewhere. I do have to say that I am glad that I watched the shorts beforehand because I was able to fully appreciate the film's focus on the relationship between Peabody and Sherman.",1430006400,,8177,4.544776119402985

6186360,5,B00HNGZK6I,"How does one go about doing a movie after a classic, but somewhat campy cartoon that ran from the late 50's to early 60's?  It seems others have tried without hitting the mark.  Des McAnuff's 2000 adaptation of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle certainly springs to mind.  Despite it's rather all-star cast (Rene Russo, Jason Alexander, Robert di Nero, Carl Riener, et al), the movie certainly came up more than a bit lacking in entertainment value.  Certainly the comic talents of one Brendon Fraser were inadequate for Hugh Wilson's 1999 telling of Dudley Do-Right...one of the few times where I felt the $1 rental fee was actually something of a rip off.  After having grown up with the original Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (in syndication at least) including Peabody's Improbably History, Fractured Fairly Tales, Dudley Do-Right, etc. (""...look Natasha...is moose and squirrel""), I must admit to a certain degree of mixed feelings when I first saw the advertisements for Mr. Peabody & Sherman at a local movie theater.  I always loved Peabody's Improbable History, with it's off-beat (some might say really bad) puns and as a 3D artist myself, I was certainly interested to see how (or how well) they were going to do this as a movie, however after having been disappointed with the previous attempts mentioned...I had my doubts.

Here, after having watched the movie 4 times already in one week, I'm very pleased to say those doubts, without a doubt, have been put to rest.  Within 10 minutes of the opening, Mr. Peabody and Sherman had me giggling like a little kid.  While I will try to avoid giving away too many spoilers (I suspect a synopsis should be easy to find on the internet by now), after a brief introduction by Mr. Peabody of course, the first 10 minutes or so of the movie truly pays homage to the original show, including  a trip in the WABAC machine (significantly updated for this incarnation) to the French Revolution...and Marie Antoinette's obsession with ""all things covered in frosting"".  The French Revolution sequence truly put me in the mind of the classic Peabody stories.  This however, is simply where the adventure begins...

Unlike others, I won't really do too much of a comparison of Rob Minkoff's 2014 adaptation, Mr. Peabody & Sherman with the original Peabody's Improbable History as it's much like a group of Trekkies (or Trekkers, whatever...) trying to compare TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and the latest ""reboot"" movies...everyone is going to have an opinion as to which is ""better"".  I will say however that this new movie truly is something that stands well enough on it's own and should appeal to those ""young at heart"".  I would also add briefly that this new movie does pay, in my not so humble opinion, a proper homage to the original, loaded with tons of the campy humor and bad puns that the original show was notorious for, while providing a rather touching and intelligent story line.  Ok...sure...a few of the gags are a tad childish at times, but for myself at least, that was half the fun!  I can't say that this movie will ""bring back one's childhood"" with memories of the original, so much as it simply makes one feel like a child again, if only for a short time.

Now I will say that for those ever so stolid of heart, again there is a degree of ""campy humor"" found in this movie.  For those who may be easily offended by a good fart joke or the word ""Boobies"", you may wish to find your pleasure elsewhere.  Likewise, for those who believe that children are best protected from such things by the use of a hermetically sealed plastic bubble, there could be a degree of offense taken with this movie...again I would reiterate the words ""campy humor"" (some of the jokes are a bit silly, childish and tacky).  For those of us who can appreciate a well intended bad pun or a crude but effective visual gag, along with a rather heartwarming story and a fair dash of action and suspense to go with it, then Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a simply delightful way to spend 92 minutes of your time (not including extra features of course).  This movie would likely appeal to those who have entertainment tastes which run along the lines of the comedy legend Mel Brooks (who actually makes a cameo appearance in this movie as Albert Einstein...""Hey...I'm walkin' here!"").  With such tastes in mind, this would certainly qualify as a great family movie in that it should entertain both child and adult alike.

Ok, with the primary accolades aside, I do have a few other small notes to ad here.  As an artist myself and particularly as an amateur 3D animator, while I would expect nothing less from Dreamworks, I have to say the 3D/CGI work in this movie is really stunning.  I've taken a few minutes to scan thru the movie, looking at the lighting and textures and it's really amazing how very well the work is done here even when compared with the likes of Monsters Inc, Ice Age, etc...  Even with DVD (nope...haven't upgraded to Blue Ray yet) on my old RCA 27"" crt (nope, no LCD), the quality of the animation is most impressive.  Considering the original (I know...I said I wasn't going to compare) was a rather low quality, ""old school"" style of animation and rather simplistic in style, the 3D work of Mr. Peabody & Sherman is visually appealing...it keeps with the general aesthetic style of the original while bringing it smartly into the 21st century.

Likewise, I have to say that as a person who's also a musician and a music lover, I found the soundtrack to be equally pleasing.  Anyone familiar with movie scores in general should be no stranger to the work of Danny Elfman and as with most of his work, Elfman delivers a score that's pleasing as well as quite fitting and appropriate for this movie.  Perhaps most notable however is the use of John Lennon's ""Beautiful Boy"" in a particular sequence (some might say a flashback) of how Mr. Peabody came to be Sherman's father...quite touching to say the least.  Even greats such as George Gershwin and Jimi Hendrix make a brief appearances (musically of course).  I also found the voices of Ty Burrell (Mr. Peabody) and Max Charles (Sherman) to be most convincing in capturing the essence of the original characters....very well cast to say the least.

Since this is a review of the DVD, I'd be remiss if I didn't say just a few words about the ""extra/special features"", as that's often one of the appeals of DVD.  The version I have only has limited features...essentially a brief tour of the WABAC machine (which explains what that word actually means), along with an examination of the concept of ""time travel"".  Not terribly significant in and of themselves and certainly nothing I would spend any extra money for, however enjoyable none the less.  That said, a brief search on Youtube reveals that there may be some other extra features (such as a blooper reel), perhaps available in other versions/releases of the movie (perhaps international?)...something to look forward to.

So to wrap this all up, I have to give this one a full 5 stars, along with 2 thumbs up (and a couple of toes!).  This is a genuinely delightful movie that even had my wife snickering from time to time.  Including cameos from personalities such as Agamemnon, Leonardo da Vinci,  Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Bill Clinton (?), King Tut, et. al., this is a great family movie, touching at times, frequently silly and with a fabulous sense of improbable history...

No doubt about it...every dog should have a boy.",1429142400,,7526,4.740030674846626

6186375,5,B00HNGZK6I,"Are you a major fan of time travel movies?  This needs to be in your movie library.  The extra features on this DVD include commentary from actual physicists.  Are you a chiropractor?  There's at least one scene in this movie that will either make you roll on the floor laughing or get your goat.  Are your kids all hopped up on sugary, caffeine packed energy drinks?  This movie will keep their attention.

The plot starts out simply enough, but when Sherman commandeers the Wabac machine to impress a girl... Great Scott!  Chronological entropy ensues and boils into the most chaotic and mind bending version of history ever presented on screen.  For you old school fans of ""Peabody's Improbable History"", this jazzed up version keeps almost every element of the original, but correcting the stray of the historical time lines can be much more complicated than what was shown in the original.  On a technical comparison to the original, I'd say it's 99% accurate.  You'll spot that other 1% early in the movie.",1428364800,,1012,4.825581395348837

6186625,2,B00HNGZK6I,"I was so very disappointed in this film.
There are plot holes throughout the story, and frustrating moments.
Mr Peabody attempts an almost BBC Sherlock approach to some moments, but it is poorly executed. The humor is sadly lacking, although some slapstick moments are great. The relationship between Sherman and Mr Peabody is surprisingly good, all things considered.

However.

My main issue with this movie is the female characters. Yeah, okay, I know, ""oooh all you care about is feminist crap"". No, not really, but I'm really disappointed. Who do we have? Who are our main female characters?

Marie Antoinette - who is shown as fat, vapid, and cake-obsessed.

Penny - the little girl bully. Yes, let's have the pretty blonde girl be the bully. SO ORIGINAL. She doesn't really grow as a character - she's ruthless and cruel until she needs help, at which point she turns on the charm, manipulating Sherman. But that's okay because Sherman actually likes her, right? God forbid we show our kids that boys and girls can work together platonically.

Penny's Mom - shown as blonde and stupid.

Ms Grunion - ah yes. The villain is a pink-dressed child services woman. Of course she is. She's wrapped up in pink like Dolores Umbridge, and speaks over the traditionally meek-looking school official. She's cruel. She's harsh. And she's the only villain. ((Spoiler))She is also kidnapped at the end by our nice Grecian Hero-Jock-Type....and apparently okay with that. Yes, because I want to show my kids that being kidnapped against your will-screaming and strugging-is totally going to end in happily-ever-after.

Mona Lisa - who is shown as rude and self-absorbed, and while Leonardo uses painting methods she gets the more ""street"" graffiti.

Why? Why do all of the male characters have better motivations and personalities than these shallow, vapid portrayals of women? I am so frustrated: I expect better from Dreamworks. I expected better from Mr Peabody & Sherman.",1424736000,2,1967,5.068111455108359

6186649,2,B00HNGZK6I,"Rated for brief ""rude"" humor.  Mr. Peabody & Sherman tries to reimagine and retell a classic cartoon series of yore by today's standards.  The movie begins with an episode typical of the fondly remembered series then it abruptly changes tone and humor in order to highlight and glorify an incident in a school lunchroom where a vicious brat seeks to humiliate poor Sherman.  This outrage proceeds for an uncomfortable measure of time, where it's milked for all it's worth (the filmmakers obviously relished the idea of seeing a child ridiculed and hurt), as this vicious brat then escalates her harassment into that of a physical nature.  I'm not entirely certain what message the filmmakers were trying to suggest, but I found it very telling that they detailed the horrors of the bullying in graphic detail while hiding Sherman's reprisal (he bit her to make her to let him go).  Naturally, he's the one to get in trouble and not the brat who started the fracas.  Enter the villain of the piece, the second bully, Ms Grunion, a Children's Services agent who makes an immediate determination that puts Mr. Peabody on the defensive.  The motives of this villain are never made clear other than she wants to remove Sherman from Peabody's care.

The potential fun of a romp through history is lost due to the cruel nature of what these filmmakers think passes for amusement.  One would almost think they were trying to create a primer on how to pick on kids deemed `different.'

Once upon a time, this ageless cartoon was about time travel and silly puns.  It wasn't complicated.  It didn't need to be fixed.  It didn't need to be updated.",1424476800,2,1637,4.76241134751773

6186760,4,B00HNGZK6I,"This movie is a cultural Trojan Horse,
I'm kind of amazed that none of the reviewers have reckoned what, to me must be the central conceit of this childrens movie.
It is almost entirely a homage to Father's Rights Issues and how our modern culture has devastated the family and ignored the needs of boys.
In this retelling of Jay Ward's classic, but simple, cartoon vignettes. Mr Peabody is an savant genius dog who struggles to adopt a human boy,
to the extreme irritation of the Huge Dog hating Feminists working for the state. He succeeds but finds he is always defending his right to be a parent.

When his boy enrolls in school, he finds himself bullied by a little girl who uses her female privilege to humiliate him until he can't stand anymore and he lashes out. This, of course, results in a predictable overreaction by the state. In an attempt to ameliorate the situation, Peabody invites the girls family to a social dinner, and the nasty little girl proceeds to use his time machine to create havoc. At one point in time, the little girl makes a plan to marry King Tut, and then ""Take him for everything he's Got"". By the end of the program order is restored, the little girl learned her lesson, and the Father/Dog is allowed continued access to his child. Oh and the Evil Feminist Social Worker apparatchik is thrown into a black hole.

I mean, this films got every issue we are fighting for, all perfectly packaged and sugar coated for young kids to absorb and be ready to continue the culture wars. I really have to hand it to Mr. Burrell, this film is a Orwellian masterpiece disguised as a ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" short.",1423872000,,1636,4.561224489795919

6186785,4,B00HNGZK6I,"MR. PEABODY & SHERMAN is a delightful family film with a great message that will appeal to children and their parents. Based on a segment from 1960's cartoon ""Rocky and Friends,"" it tells the story of an extraordinarily smart dog named Mr. Peabody who adopted a boy named Sherman. Aside from being awesome, Mr. Peabody has also invented a time machine which he calls the WABAC (pronounced way-back). Of course, once Sherman finally goes to school (and full of knowledge from all of the first-hand history lessons courtesy of the WABAC) he encounters a bit of trouble, particularly with a mean girl named Penny. Hoping to smooth things over with her parents, he invites Penny and her family over for dinner and that's when the movie really takes off, as Sherman and Penny go on an adventure that has the potential to alter the space-time continuum.

The first thing I'll say about this film is that it is very funny. Kids won't get all of the jokes and references, but there is enough humor for the younger people in the audience as well some puns and history-related references that the older people will get. The animation and character design was also very good, and I thought the filmmakers did a fine job in realizing the different time periods that are visited during the film. Complementing it very nicely was a good score by Danny Elfman, although I didn't realize it was him until the closing credits. But most of all, the film has a couple of important messages about family and growing up. As Mr. Peabody is a dog who has adopted a human, it wouldn't take much reaching to draw parallels with recent efforts to redefine what a family can be, be it one with a single parent or one with same-sex parents. Social definitions change, and I thought that the film addressed this in a rather sweet, yet oblique enough, way.

There is also the central relationship of Mr. Peabody with Sherman. Despite being a dog, he's not unlike most parents that have reservations about letting their child (or children) go and experience the world for themselves. The way in which Mr. Peabody comes to realize this is a bit convoluted and long-winded, but the end result is rather touching. My only real complaint with the film is one that I have with a lot of films, and that is the third act gets a little too crazy, even for a story involving time travel, yet gets resolved rather neatly. Of course, if characters in movies were half as smart as the audience, then maybe there wouldn't be as much of a story. Still, I enjoyed this very much for its humor and message. It's a great family film that kids and adults can enjoy together.",1423526400,,2625,4.6068376068376065

6186982,3,B00HNGZK6I,"Let me preface my thoughts by saying I have grown up watching replays from the old Rocky and Friends TV shows, from which the film has its roots. While I cant say Peabodys Improbable History is my favorite section of the shows, every now and then you get some hilarious glimpses at the life of the dog and his boy, and I cant say I have much but enjoyable memories of the brilliant, but painful-pun-telling dog. Of course, the best part was always Sherman, with his innocent humor and hilarious facial expressions.

The trailers to the film kept enough of those moments alive to intrigue me. And then throwing in the fact that it was directed by Rob Minkoff (co-director of The Lion King), not to mention the voice cast, I decided to give it a go.

I think it hit right about where I was expecting. There isn't anything really great about it, there are a lot of little things I liked, and quite a few little things I didnt. For me, I think the most important test was to see if the filmmakers nailed the characters of Peabody and Sherman. And for the most part, I was satisfied. Mr. Peabody is still telling the bad puns, and while he definitely shows more emotion in the film role, for the most part hes still the calm, smart one, taking everything in perfect stride. With Shermans character, there were a few more bumps, but also a lot of perfect touches. In the film he isn't quite as carefree, and rather than frowning upon Peabodys bad puns, he just doesnt get them. However, I loved Max Charles in the role, and Sherman is still hilarious for his innocence and faces.

Moving beyond the characters, the next big hurdle is the story. And again, the film hits some big points, but falls short on others. Im still not sure about the girl storyline. She was downright annoying, and although it could have been handled a lot worse, I don't think that was the best option for a side conflict. Choosing to concentrate on the relationship between Peabody and Sherman was a good story to explore, although it comes at a slight price for me. Part of the hilarity of the relationship in the TV shows is that they both accept it without question. While digging into their relationship provides good conflict and a nice father/son storyline, it does take away a little from the original concept. Overall, I enjoyed the 1st act and setup, but the end fell short. It was thoughtfully crafted, meaning all the pieces came back together, with many reflections of the beginning, but it just didn't pack a big punch.

And Im still wondering what is up with Dreamworks character design. After a few solid jobs with Megamind, The Croods and even Rise of the Guardians, I was hoping we were past the ugly distorted people with tiny necks and phenomenal facial features. But I guess those days aren't quite behind us yet.

I should also put in a good word for Danny Elfman. His score really stands out nicely in the film, occasionally even seeming too good for a film like this.

In the end, I found Mr. Peabody and Sherman to be an enjoyable film. It certainly has its lows and highs, but it was a fun journey, and one I wouldnt mind going on again.",1420675200,,3133,4.487719298245614

6187053,2,B00HNGZK6I,"I really liked watching the Peabody's Improbable History segments of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, so naturally, I got excited and anticipated to see one of the best segments of Rocky and Bullwinkle get their own motion picture. Heck, even the beginning of the movie seemed very much like a typical short from the cartoon series. <sigh> But, once Sherman has to got to school the next day, it goes straight downhill from there. Sherman gets bullied by a *^#@ing brat known as Penny Peterson, Sherman bits her, and Mr. Peabody is faced with the threat of Sherman getting taken away by a crazy social worker known as Ms. Grunion. The more I thought about these problems, I just kept seeing flaw after flaw after flaw with this movie for a year and a month now! None of my complaints are that they are different from the cartoon; they're complaints about how they stand as a stand-alone-film. Everyone always complains that Frozen won't leave their minds, but this was the movie that kept buzzing around my head. But disregarding that, the dialogue is awkward and uncomfortable at times, and at times a little bizarre. And I don't mean Mr. Peabody's puns, oh no, they stay true to the original cartoons. But Ms. Grunion actually sounds like she's encouraging bullying. The principal acknowledges Penny's bad stunts, but Ms. Grunion shuts him up! And when Penny apologizes to Sherman, Ms. Grunion says she has nothing to apologize about. That implies she was encouraging Penny to bully! No! No! That's a serious flaw! But how about the time traveling adventures? Do they keep interest. Egypt? No. Renaissance, Italy? Mostly. Greek? Eh, a little bit. I did like a few jokes like that Sphinx butt one, or that joke where the trojans are coming out of the horse's butt. I admit I did enjoy Sherman and Penny's flight scene- that had great bonding moment! I wanted more of that! Also, I thought it was really cool to see the historical figures in modern New York City! That was great! I wanted more of that. I know everything works out in the end, but all the trouble that had happened was just too much for me. And here's another major problem- I think Penny Peterson is too stupid, concieted, and selfish. I know she changes her ways in the end, but still. King Tut offers to actually KILL Mr. Peabody and Sherman and hang their skins. What does Penny do? She actually gasps and smiles and says ""You'd do that for me?"" NO! That's way too mean-spirited! I don't know what else to say. I really did want to like this movie because it starred Mr. Peabody and Sherman one of the great characters from the Rocky and Bullwinkle show, but this movie was just too much for me. It's not entertaining, it's not fun, it's too flawed, and its not even that funny. This is definetly one of my least favorite Dreamworks films. For me, this is definetly a skip.",1420416000,2,2841,4.616600790513834

6187317,3,B00HNGZK6I,"I grew up watching Rocky and Bullwinkle and their friends on prime time TV and later on Saturday morning TV.  Mr. Peabody and Sherman were fun to watch, on their segment of the show. The old cartoon was crudely drawn, even by the standards of the day. Warners Brothers and Disney cartoons were much more polished, but Mr Peabody had interesting story lines and puns on history and often prompted me to learn more about the history that their segments featured.

This movie is of course, created with much greater sophistication than the cartoon of my childhood. It was very cool to see Mr Peabody's home, learn greater details of his and Sherman's history and see the home they live in and a much more complicated wayback machine.  It is fun to watch, but mostly for the novelty.  Patrick Warburton is hilarious as Agamemnon, he does a great job with how he times his lines and uses his inflections.  Ty Burrell and Max Charles were quite good in recreating the character of the voices of Peabody and Sherman as I remember them.  Ty Burrell gave Mr Peabody much more heart than I recall from the original, but then he had more time in a movie to develop character than one had in a 7 minute cartoon. I thought the voice actors did a lot with what they had to work with.  The plot, largely based on avoiding the danger of Peabody's and Sherman's family being taken away from them and dire consequences created by a headstrong foolish character who matures in the midst of the hardship that this one has created, is truthfully, in my opinion a rather tired plot, and for me, hard to watch, but the side side trips into history are a lot of fun as is the nostalgia of the movie. I would have liked to see the plot have more to do with an interaction with history than a fairly formulaic relationship plot of the consequences of youthful rebellion and reconciliation.",1419379200,,1863,4.526785714285714

6187340,4,B00HNGZK6I,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman are no doubt historic characters in the world of animation. In their case they are responsible for making actual history!

When I found out this film was coming I was very excited. Having a chance to have seen some of the actual cartoon episodes I was looking forward to it. This film was far from perfect, but it was a lot of fun. The film is of course given a story that has to last about 30 minutes, when in the actual cartoon the two of them just go time traveling for 5 minutes. There is no elongated plots and nothing really has to take place. The setting in the present is also modern in order for children to appreciate the setting. Still, the film pays a ton of tribute to the cartoon, especially with all the lame jokes and puns, which had me laughing the hardest. The film also has a great cast with Ty Burrell leading the pack as Mr. Peabody and he was great!

This a real feel good film. I love that a ton of heart was added to these characters to really evolve them for a more modern audience. Being able to create such an appealing film and still be able to capture the essence of the original show is a win win for me.",1419379200,,1158,4.165178571428571

6187468,5,B00HNGZK6I,"I have a strong affinity for the two dimensional rendering of Mr. Peabody and Sherman from television so I went into this reboot with a little apprehension.  After seeing this film my fears went unfounded.  The makers of the film had the daunting task of making the film intelligent, funny, and accessible to parents and kids alike without upsetting the fanboys.  The edge of the original cartoons has been sacrificed to some degree but the essence has been retained.  The film offers a fractured history lesson to kids but that's why parents are there to set the record straight.  Gags that adults will enjoy probably will go over most kids' heads.  First rate animation to go along with the narrative.  Criticizing this film is akin to critiquing Santa and the Easter Bunny.",1418515200,,776,4.833333333333333

Mr. Peabody and Sherman is the big-screen, computer-animated version of the delightful cartoon series from the 1950s and early 1960s, which featured the time-traveling escapades of Mr. Peabody, the long-eared, pun-spouting canine scientist, and his human sidekick, Sherman, the orphaned red-headed boy whom Peabody has adopted and raised as his own son. Together they use the trusty WABAC machine that Peabody has invented to travel back in time to major events in history and encounters with some of the most famous figures the world has ever known.  Though much of the history is of the fractured, revisionist type - freely mixing fact with fiction, reality with myth - there is always a lighthearted moral lesson to be imparted both to the ever-quizzical Sherman and to the audience as a whole.

This latest incarnation finds Mr. Peabody and Sherman time-tripping their way back to such destinations as the French Revolution, ancient Egypt, Renaissance Italy and war-torn Troy, where they meet up with Marie Antoinette, King Tut, Leonardo Da Vinci and (the mythological) King Agamemnon, respectively.

Written by Craig Wright and directed by Rob Minkoff, the movie boasts snappy dialogue, zippy pacing, a clean, streamlined design and more in-jokes and cultural references aimed at the grownups in the audience than one might reasonably expect from a movie of this sort (there are at least two fairly off-color jokes that children likely won't get but adults certainly will).

Modern Familys Ty Burrell does a first rate job giving voice to Mr. Peabody, nicely replicating the work done originally by Bill Scott. Ditto for Max Charles as Sherman, as well as Stephen Colbert, Allison Janney, and Stanley Tucci, among others, in supporting roles.

Yet, for all its virtues, Mr. Peabody and Sherman reminds us of something that the creators of the original series - and that includes the great Jay Ward - apparently knew all along, which is that certain pleasures in this life are best appreciated when taken in smaller doses.",1418169600,,2034,5.167173252279635

It is hard to take a 6-10 minute short and make a 90 minute movie.
But if you like puns, it still has them.

They spend a lot more on the time travel/sci-fi aspect of this than the actual history. That takes always some of the original charm but I'm always a sucker for a paradox too.

My kids range from 6 to 8 year old and everyone liked it. Not as much as say Frozen or Kung Fu Panda, but they would watch it again if given a choice.",1416787200,,622,3.8818897637795278

I would not say that the movie is educational per se unless you're sitting right there with your young one explaining the various characters but it is an entertaining time travel romp.

If as a parent, you're looking for a decent movie for your seven to eleven year old, this is a good choice.  I have a four year old who was entertained by it.  From an adult perspective, the movie is watchable so it won't drive you nuts, like some kids movies.

I was frankly worried that they would ruin it as happens so often today with the modern Hollywood mindset.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It wasn't that bad.  The story begins where Mr. Peabody is successful in adopting Sherman because if a boy has the right to adopt a dog, a dog has a right to adopt a boy.  Some reviewers thought that this was something added, but I just want to point out that this was in the first episode of the original Mr. Peabody & Sherman.  I still don't think that today's writers are at the same level of wit and humor as the original creators, but I still think people will find this story entertaining.",1416096000,,712,4.396946564885496

Mr Peabody warns Sherman of a booby trap and Beavis, I mean Sherman, says huh..huh.. You said boobie.  This goes on for the entire length of the movie, just salted into the dialog randomly to keep the 8 year old boys who are so high on sugar and caffeine from the 64 ounce soda they got, that they can't stay in their seat without a little scatological humor thrown in at regular intervals.

The thing is Mr Peabody and Sherman was a quality brand that up until now got by on its wits.  I figured it was a safe franchise to watch with my kid.  Frankly, the gloves came off in Hollywood when Jar Jar Binks stepped in a big pile of poop in the first Star Wars prequel.

6188174,4,B00HNGZK6I,"In Mr Peabody and Shermon, the time-travelling duo returns to fix a time rift they created.

For me, this cartoon brought back some memories of watching one of my favorite cartoons, Rocky and Bullwinkle, so I was interested to see the modern version of Mr. Peabody.  Although I always preferred the banter between Bullwinkle, Rocky and Boris, I was amused by the puns that Mr. Peabody would always make in the cartoon within the cartoon show.  And the puns return along with some funny characters of history that really had me laughing.  Although there are some subtle difference in story and the relationship between the two, but still the basic parts of the original cartoon was still there.

This is a fun movie for both for kids and for adults, especially for those like me that grew up on the reruns.  Although I will admit, I miss the original vocalists for the characters though, but the new actors did do a good close version of the voices.  The story is good and has lots of good messages for kids as well.  I am a kid at heart and I enjoyed it.

6188195,4,B00HNGZK6I,"The trailers gave me the impression that this was a subpar kids movie with characters that were aimed at a pre schooler audience.

I watched it after it was released to DVD and was blown away by how grand and epic it turned out to be with a lot of fun humor for adults.  Too bad the trailers and marketing did not convey the high entertainment value that this movie really proved to have - it might have grossed better at the box office.

I have not had this much fun watching a computer animation movie since Over The Hedge.  I hardly remember the origional Mr. Peabody cartoon from 1959-1960 to compare it with.

I was not expecting this but, Mr. Peabody & Sherman turned out to be my favorite animated film of 2014. Including some world history, with humor that adults can enjoy, along a very well developed character in Mr. Peabody, I enjoy it every time I watched it. I like some of the epic scenes. Some of the humor and screen writing was smart.

I rented it from Redbox for a couple of nights. Then, I checked it out of the public library. Recently, I finally acquired the Mr. Peabody & Sherman (Blu-ray / DVD + Digital Copy) combo package.",1415750400,,1148,4.366197183098592

Now he is only 6 so I was worried he wouldn't understand the history lesson part of this movie.. I was waaay wrong! Though he is only in kindergarten and hasn't studied history yet.. After watching this movie he was going up to his parents & grandparents spouting history facts! It was adorable and I love that it was also educational! Great movie! I'm glad they remade this into a movie... I remember watching reruns of mr Peabody & Sherman as a kid! Great for all ages! Hilarious!,1414713600,,592,4.342342342342342

6188770,2,B00HNGZK6I,"I remember the old Saturday morning original (part of the Bullwinkle show) and wanted to see this update after reading good reviews. Ty Burrell does a very good job doing Peabody's voice and the animators kept true to the original character's look. I liked the update to the WABAC machine - the original was merely a door surrounded by lights, knobs and dials. Now it's a red pod with awesome display controls, that zips through wormholes to reach its destinations. Very good effects. But sadly, it doesn't hold up for adults. I'd say that it's target is the preteen set. While not necessarily a bad movie, it just didn't appeal to me like so many of the other great animations that have come before it. The witty, wink-wink nudge-nudge moments were missing, which makes these kiddie movies enjoyable to adults. Pleasant enough for a family viewing, but noting here to warrant an additional viewing for a geezer like me. I did enjoy seeing the guy with the push-broom at the very end of the movie - another nod to the original.",1414195200,2,1027,4.679558011049724

We watched the movie and think it was made for four year olds. 2. Boy, 10: We read the reviews and most of them were good so we had hopes that it was going to be as good as the reviews. Instead it was short, totally predictable, and not very interesting. Girl, 7: we all thought it was nothing special. I liked some parts, but I liked other movies better. Dad: We have recently watched The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and Forest Gump and after such good movies this was a real dud. Wait till it comes out for free on Prime or Netflix and then see if you are still curious. Mom: I am willing to see a good cartoon movie, but this was pretty thin.

Didn't know what to expect from this new version, but I must say.. all the elements of the original were there for me.  The ""superior attitude"" of genius Mr. Peabody, and the young questioning of Sherman.  Could not stop laughing at times (the Trojan Horse scene was a real treat).. in fact, all the various historical scenes were well played.  Enough science fiction in the WayBack Machine to really enthrall my 'Star Trek' personality as well.
I want to own this.. just rented it to check it out.  Sometimes, there are movies you want to see again and again.. this is one of them!",1414022400,,663,4.53781512605042

They also left this movie wishing that our cats would talk like Mr. Peabody too. All-in-all this was a great movie that was a ton of light-hearted fun for the whole family!

It was very dry humor and often sly. I thought this movie will just be violent slapstick, hyper-action and fart jokes aimed at today's youth. Well okay, it does have a lot of hyper-action and a few slapstick fart jokes but it's also incredibly sweet and charming. Ty Burrell is perfect as the voice of Mr Peabody and Stan Tucci as Leonardo DeVinci is terrific. Of course, Patrick Warburton has done almost too many epic voice-overs but still, he's spot on as Agamemnon the Trojan warrior.

The digital HD works with iTunes as well as other applications.

It took about ten seconds to unlock the movie.  We had the option to enter the code manually but of course we did not choose that option.

6189013,2,B00HNGZK6I,"I am too young to have been a true fan of Rocky & Bullwinkle or Mr. Peabody and Sherman, though I have always known the characters.  My disappointment with this movie therefore has nothing to do with comparison to the originals.  Frankly, the movie was just plain boring.  I watched it with my 10y.o. daughter.  Neither of us laughed much (I think I laughed twice....maybe a third time as I was feeling grateful that we had only rented this).  The best thing about the movie was the animation, which was great, and the opening John Lennon song.  The adventures were corny, the characters generally uninteresting and the story felt poorly developed and unorganized.  At one point, I found myself asking how Mr. P. had ended up with Sherman.  I thought that I had somehow missed that bit.  No, I hadn't...it was just buried in the story, told at a bizarre moment in peculiar order.  I can not recommend this movie at all.",1413763200,2,919,4.617283950617284

He finds it comforting.  I like that it puts adoption in such a positive light, where it truly belongs.  I also like that this is a major studio production without (too much of) the jive, urban slang that find so irritating in the other dumb-down or aimed-at-the-parent movies.

6189035,4,B00HNGZK6I,"On its own, as a family movie, Mr. Peabody & Sherman isn't anything that special. However, for those out there for are fans of the original cartoon series, this movie pretty much hits the nail on the head. The characters are just as you remember them. The adventures, the puns, the irreverent look back on famous moments of human history. It's all there. And better then ever!

It has its flaws, to be sure. The main conflict of the movie (whether Mr. Peabody will be allowed to keep Sherman) isn't really resolved at all. The logic is things that happen doesn't always follow through. All that makes only a dent in what is other wise a functional family adventure comedy. A definite must-watch for fans of Mr. Peabody's Improbable History. A workable, inoffensive flick for everyone else.",1413676800,,789,4.759124087591241

6189236,5,B00HNGZK6I,"If I ever saw the original TV show segment in Rocky and Bullwinkle reruns as a kid, I definitely don't remember it.  So other than recognising the characters from popular culture references such as a Far Side cartoon where Mr Peabody is backing his car over a peculiar thump and sees flattened glasses on the driveway that further intrigued him, I relied on this movie to provide enough backstory so I'd know what was going on.  It certainly does so, and is actually quite an enjoyable film.  Like most time travel based movies, there's some holes in the storyline, this one reminded me the most of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure with the interactions with historical important figures and at one stage some of them coming back to the present. But there's also a pretty good side story of Sherman (the kid) being forced to spend time with his bully, and of course they become friends and ultimately care about saving each other when faced with various ""young kid scary level"" peril.  There's also a bigot fuelled villain woman who doesn't like the idea of a dog having been allowed to adopt a human boy who Mr Peabody has to also deal with.

The animation is modern 3D style and quite comical, even though we have the Trojan battle and French guillotine action, from a violent history there's never even really a hint that we'll see any of it.  Ty Burrell who we obviously know best from Modern Family does a brilliant job as the voice of Mr Peabody letting the viewer experience expressions and different moods and feelings of the dog that is a bit harder to illustrate than the human characters' faces.  Modern Family fans may also find it interesting to note that the main female character Penny is also voiced by an actor from that show, Ariel Winter.

As I said you don't need to be familiar with these characters to understand this movie, although I would have liked a scene showing how Mr Peabody got to be really intelligent and be able to speak, maybe being rescued from a research laboratory or something.",1412121600,,2019,4.635854341736695

Would recommend this movie to everyone. It is funny for children and adults alike.",1410825600,2,385,5.015625
6189336,3,B00HNGZK6I,"Dreamworks Animation puzzles me. Sometimes the work they release borders on the masterpiece: Kung Fu Panda 2, or How to Train Your Dragon, and other times the movies they release are uninspired, simple-minded affairs that entertain only the least demanding of children. Mr. Peabody and Sherman sadly falls under the second category. You know your film is in trouble when the biggest laugh you get is seeing Ludwig van Beethoven do breakdancing on one of those arcade dance machines. (That being said, that moment is utterly hilarious and never fails to make me laugh).

The biggest problem that Mr. Peabody and Sherman has, is in fact the same problem that Mr. Peabody the dog has: he can never make that emotional connection, and he's far too smart for the people who need him. MPaS rejects heart and drama for a bizarre and inexplicable moment in which a bunch of historical figures proclaim that ""I am a dog"". Sure there's a bit of emotional reconciliation, but it seems lost under the waves and waves of obvious ""wink wink"" historical jokes.

And that's the worst part. How on earth do the directors attempt to get away with jokes about the Trojan war, French Revolution, and ancient Egypt, when the kind of audience that will be experiencing this film will likely be composed of young children who don't know their Antoinette from their Akenhaton. And as an actual history buff myself, it was more than aggravating to see them reduce figures like Leonardo da Vinci, Tutankhamen, and Robespierre to buffoonish idiots. The one figure who comes out on top is Achilles, voiced with aplomb and gusto by Patrick Warburton. This is perhaps fitting, seeing as he isn't historic.

But don't go giving me all that, ""oh, but it's fun for kids"" nonsense. In my child-filled audience for this film, there was open cringing at the sound of Ty Burrell's (an excellent actor, btw; see him in The Muppets 2) grating and cloying voice for Mr. Peabody, and looks of disbelief at the massive, disproportioned heads of the characters. No, seriously - it's weird. The characters have these balloon heads onto of stick necks. Their spinal cords should snap the moment they stand up. But maybe I'm over-thinking this.

Maybe this was just a silly, fun movie meant for children. Certainly it is popular and funny with them. And yes, you're probably right. I am over-thinking this. But I just think we should demand more from our childrens' movies. Which is why ultimately, although the appeal to children is perfectly adequate, Mr. Peabody and Sherman misses the mark. If I had a WABAC, I'd go back to Dreamworks and help them write a new script. Because a Peabody and Sherman film that has heart, humor, and great visuals...THAT is a movie I want to see. My rating? 250 BC out of 500 BC.",1408752000,,2768,4.772442588726514
6189337,5,B00HNGZK6I,"I did not grow up watching Rocky and Bullwinkle. The first time I watched a recording of the original Peabody and Sherman I thought it was a ludicrous concept and, 5 minutes in, was completely hooked!

I love how the Peabody and Sherman movie has been rewritten to make it fit the imagination of today's child and yet it manages to include the time travelling exploration of history as the old show used to. Sherman and Penny visit Ancient Egypt, Renaissance Italy (to visit Leonardo Da Vinci and Mona Lisa) and Troy just as the Trojan horse is being delivered! There is a lot of wit to the script of this movie and I found myself holding back the giggles just as much as my kids were. The over the top abilities of the erudite Mr. Peabody and the sweet openness of Sherman made this an absolutely marvelous experience for the kids and adult alike.

Keep an ear open for Patrick Warburton doing an impressively thick Agamemnon and the quick little appearance of Mel Brooks as Einstein!  We have watched it twice in theatres and I can't wait to get a copy when it is finally released on Blu-ray!",1407974400,,1094,4.4874371859296485

6189339,5,B00HNGZK6I,"The tagline says ""He's leaving his mark on history,"" which is funny when you remember that Mr. Peabody is a dog. Of course this is the brilliant dog who invented the WABAC (""Way-Back"") Machine and adopted a little boy named Sherman.

This animated PG movie is based on the wonderful television series by the same name that started in the late 50s and ran in the 60s. By now, fans should have children and grandchildren to bring along...smile... They will be exposed to a smattering of history and will be entertained all the way. Much of the sly humor is aimed at the adults who buy the tickets.

Here are the characters:
  * Mr. Peabody swears Sherman to secrecy, particularly about the WABAC.
  * Sherman can't keep a secret, particularly from a big-eyed little girl.
  * Penny Peterson is a cruel, cunning, curious little charmer.
  * Patty and Paul Peterson are her parents.
  * Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci, King Tut, George Washington, Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein (with a Rubic's Cube), Abraham Lincoln, and too many others to count, e.g., combatants in the Trojan War. Of course they were wasted on the little 'uns, but we recognize their names.

My VERY favorite segments:
  * A montage of Mr. Peabody adopting Sherman, then teaching him to walk, ride a bike, and many more lovely moments of parenting, with ""Beautiful Boy"" by John Lennon playing in the background.
  * ""I am a dog,"" which echoed, ""I am Spartacus!"" of classic cinema.

This is a wild ride; I am positive the parents had a better time than the children, but I didn't hear any complaints. Me? I really enjoyed it. I'm happy to see it's available on Amazon now.",1406851200,13,1666,4.705882352941177

6189343,5,B00HNGZK6I,"ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS (later THE BULLWINKLE SHOW) originally ran on tv from 1959-1964. Besides featuring the adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and their adversaries Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale, the show also included such supporting segments as Dudley Do-Right, Fractured Fairy Tales, and Peabodys Improbable History. After fifty years of sitting in the background and waiting in the wings while Rocky and Bullwinkle and Dudley Do-Right got their turn at the big screen in poor adaptations, the smartest dog in the world, Mr. Peabody and his pal Sherman finally get their turn.

As a nod to the original segments, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN begins with a narration from Mr. Peabody, the worlds smartest dog. He gives a brief biography of his life and then introduces Sherman. In the original segment, Sherman was Peabodys pet. In this day of over political correctness, theres no way that would fly so Sherman has been promoted from being a pet to being Peabodys adopted son. To assist Sherman in his education, Peabody created his greatest invention: the WABAC (pronounced Way Back) Machine. The WABAC is a time machine and Peabody has used it to take Sherman back in time to meet famous figures and watch famous historical events as they unfold. All of this has been in preparation for Shermans first day of school.

Shermans first day of school begins well, but some verbal abuse from a classmate causes him to act completely out of character. Shermans act not only causes Peabody to receive a call from the principal, but it also threatens Peabodys adoption of Sherman. Peabody attempts to make peace by inviting the instigator of the ordeal, a girl named Penny, and her parents over for dinner. Despite her behavior toward him, Sherman is smitten with Penny and one thing leads to another and before you know it, theyve travel to ancient Egypt and get in a jam and Peabody has to be called upon to rescue them. Their voyage home includes a couple of other side trips in Renaissance Italy where they visit Leonardo Da Vinci and ancient Troy on the eve of the Fall of Troy where they meet Agamemnon and Odysseus (who looks nothing at all like you imagine the man being).

Although things have been updated for a modern audience, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is very respectful of the original Peabodys Improbable History segments. For instance, those segments always ended on a bad pun and MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is filled with bad puns. There are references to other movies as well, such as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and SPARTACUS.

The movie works on a variety of levels. Sherman really acts and sounds like a seven-year old boy and children will not only be able to relate to him, but will be amused with his antics. Then on the other hand, there is Mr. Peabody who really works as a vicarious figure for the adults. Besides the bad puns, hes full of witty wordplay and makes all kinds of references that children probably won't understand, but that educated adults will. Of course, theres also the occasional base-level joke or visual thrown in that amuses almost everyone, such as seeing the Greeks climb out of the posterior end of the Trojan horse instead of the belly; its a great visual gag.

Die-hard fans of the original segments might have a little difficulty adapting to the vocals of the leads. Ty Burrell does a good job trying to replicate the visual intonations of Bill Scott as Mr. Peabody, but he does sounds different while Max Charles sounds quite different than Walter Tetley. Personally, I wasn't bothered by that, but I know there are some that will be.

Besides honoring the tv segment it is based on, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is just a great movie thats full of heart. Its a story about a father and a son and how their relationship grows and changes. Mr. Peabody has to learn to trust Sherman and let him grow up while Sherman has to find himself, but not forget where he comes from. It is a story that many fathers will relate to and there are a couple of moments in the film that I bet will make many grown men cry (I shed a couple tears).

Although, movie adaptations of tv shows rarely seem to work on the big screen, MR. PEABODY AND SHERMAN is an exception to that. Its an example of a movie that successfully adapts its source material for a modern audience without losing sight of the original material. Its a movie that both newcomers to Mr. Peabody and Sherman and longtime fans can as well as entire families can truly enjoy together.",1401494400,41,4470,4.672172808132148

It seems like some of the recent Dreamworks animated movies have missed with mainstream audiences, this, Turbo, and Rise of the Guardians for some reason hasn't made the box office they deserved. I was happy that Guardians and Turbo found life once it was released on Blu Ray and was available to stream on Netflix so I'm hoping this happens to Mr. Peabody as well.  Netflix made an animated series out of Turbo and Mr. Peabody would be perfect for an animated series, as it used to be. An updated series would be awesome.

It has a lot of funny puns, but the plot gets pretty convoluted. It would have been more satisfying going with the immediate payoff jokes and paying less attention to trying to make sense out of a time travel storyline.  It's pleasant enough, and worth seeing, but it struggles trying to stretch a 5 minute format from Bullwinkle in to a full length movie.",1400198400,,512,4.257731958762887
6189357,4,B00HNGZK6I,"At first I didn't pay much attention to this film, as many others based off of cartoons from the past have been pretty awful. I expected another Smurfs or Yogi Bear, but was pleasantly surprised by how sincere and heartfelt this was, no doubt thanks to the people of Dreamworks. I was nowhere around when the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show was airing, my mom wasn't even around then, so I had no sentimental memories of the original segment featuring these characters. I'm not sure if that would've made the film better or worse for me as ties to fond childhood memories often make us more accepting of something or see the flaws.

All that being said, I loved this film. It's not quite as emotional as Frozen, or as funny as Lego Movie, but it's certainly its own movie through and through. The relationship between Sherman and Peabody was very well-done, as you can tell they both do love each other. The major development in it is that Peabody has to accept that Sherman isn't as fragile or helpless as he wants the boy to be. The animation is fine, I feel they wanted to capture some of the spirit that was the original through simple character designs. The humor is very much for the family, with only two or three jokes meant to appease the youngest coming to see this and some meant for the adults who know the basic things about history (a subtle Oedipus joke and less subtle Clinton one, plus a Spartacus joke that is perfectly timed). The supporting characters are also enjoyable for the most part (young king Tutankhamen and Penny being hit-or-miss).

That being said, I have a few complaints that took this from five stars to four. The one-note villain Mrs. Grunion was there just to be an excuse to set things in motion and I think if they tried a little more they could have had the same film without her. Penny was a rocky character from the start, having it out for Sherman because he up-staged her in class and then being so severely mean to him that it was pretty much impossible to redeem her, no matter how hard they tried. Lastly, they seemed to neglect Penny's parents as character, who were in the movie for probably less than ten minutes, seemed like nice people (the mom certainly, the dad after a minute thanks to some chiropractic work from Peabody), and were voiced by the very talented Leslie Mann and Stephen Colbert.

So this was a really great movie, and after a surplus of fantastic animated films this and Dragons 2 may be the last major films of the genre for a little while as all studios think up some more ideas. As for the gay adoption undertone? It was a little on the nose for me but I'm sure it was just so kids would pick up on it and leave the movie with the lesson, and I'm glad for that. I like knowing my kids are learning about this through friendly sources, and that we are introducing them to acceptance at young ages.",1400025600,22,2863,4.44952380952381

6189360,1,B00HNGZK6I,"As a young child I did often watch Rocky and Bullwinkle.  That being said, I never even heard of Mr. Peabody & Sherman until I saw that it was being made into a childrens movie this year and heard the swell of groans from fans of the original show who were determined to hate this movie before the opening credits were through.  I thought that the concept and the trailer looked really intriguing and ripe with potential and so, despite the collective moaning, I was excited for this.

My kids were too.

While many balked at the film for doing no justice to their nostalgia, I couldn't grade the film on that basis because I had none.  I was walking in blind, and for me that was the best way to do so.  I was wholly prepared to love this film and be its sole champion.

I hated this movie.

Its funny.  When the film ended I looked at my wife and rolled my eyes and she asked me what was wrong and I said you liked that? and she said it was cute and I just shook my head.  Cute is fine, but this movie was just offensively bad.  From a pure storytelling narrative, the film is a messy failure, but it also fails on so many moral and parental levels that I found myself almost wanting to get up and leave, children in tow, because subjecting my children and their spongy minds to this honestly scared me.  I mean, I don't want any of this to rub off on them.  If that were to happen, that would make my job as parent so much harder.

I have a hard enough time as it is.

The story centers on a smart dog who adopts a boy because he was too smart to ever be adopted by a boy himself when he was young.  This dog, Mr. Peabody, is so smart that he has created a time machine called The Way Back, which he uses to take his son, Sherman, to experience history in an attempt to broaden his mind and prepare him for school, which he is getting ready to start.  Separation anxiety sets in, and social awkwardness overtakes Sherman to the point where his brainy nature inspired rivalry with the class bully, the class smarty-pants herself, Penny.

Blah, blah, blah.

Ok, here is my issue with this mess of a film.  First, I was excited upon the films opening that this was going to be a cleverly disguised history lesson and that my kids were going to actually learn something while having fun.  I was wrong.  The opening scene is a ruse to dupe the audience into thinking that this film was clever, but it is not.  Instead, we are subjected to a mockery of moments in history that didn't happen and so our children wind up even more confused about history or completely uninterested in actual events.  Next, why is it that every historical event depicted is of violence?  Troy, Egypt, French Revolution.  Death, death and talk of more death (and in gruesome detail).  There was a lot more to history than death.  THIS IS A KIDS MOVIE!

Next, why are these kids so mean to one another?  I have to admit, I was ready to leave when Penny started publicly mocking Sherman in the school cafeteria and assaulting him.  Is this the message we are trying to send to our children?  Not only that, but the only way that he can make friends with her is to allow her to mentally bully him into disobeying his father?  Not only that, but after she already makes a mess of history or time space whatever, she continues to bully Sherman in disobedience, and that disobedience is depicted as a good time!

Also, the Sherman/Peabody freak out yelling you're a bad boy scene felt so unnecessary and false.

And then, with all these personal irritants we come to the fact that the end of this movie is just a messy, messy climax that makes no sense, uses a lot of big words, contradicts itself and basically makes the rest of the movie feel underdeveloped.

I don't even want to get into the fact that this felt like a poorly developed attempt at fighting for gay adoption rights, but really, it does.  I understand that animated films can have an agenda and can fight the fight and I have no problem with this if it is done with some intelligence and integrity, but this is just a mockery of a film that falls flat on its face so many times I wanted to kick holes into every oversized Peabody face in the theater lobby.",1399507200,38,4194,4.303571428571429

6189363,5,B00HNGZK6I,"On the Bullwinkle show, the Fractured Fairy Tales and Peabody episodes are the ones I usually hate--and I would definitely skip over the Peabody cartoons on the DVDs if it weren't for the ridiculous characters he meets.  Peabody on the cartoon show is so so obnoxiously egotistical.  I almost didn't want to see this movie because I didn't think Peabody could actually be bearable for an entire movie.  But the Peabody on this movie, while still a know-it-all, isn't egotistical like in the show.  Ty Burrell does the voice really well, too.  I love the pick they chose for Sherman, too, Max Charles.  The movie has a lot of interest in its plot developments, and the way the action is dispersed throughout keeps it from getting uninteresting.  Many movies today don't know how to slow down, but this movie does.  I enjoy the selection of several time travel adventures, with some character development along the way.  There's a neat part where Peabody actually learns from Leonardo da Vinci that he can't treat people like scientific case studies; people's responses can't be simply scientifically programmed.  Peabody learning something from a character in history?!  That would never have happened on the cartoons!  It's really nice that the movie doesn't have Peabody saying self-aggrandizing lines, which made me hate the character on the cartoon show.  Yet it retains his absurdly perfect problem-solving, making him more like a Sherlock Holmes genius than the annoying Peabody cartoon character.

The ridiculous spirit of the cartoons is retained, in that the characters from back in time are really really dumb.  (I consider my favorite among the cartoons to be Beethoven, who needed to go everywhere to write pieces, like being on 5th Avenue in New York to write his 5th Symphony, and having to go into a cheese cellar to write the Moonlight Sonata because he thinks of cheese when he thinks of the moon, because they say the moon is made of cheese.)  On this movie, Leonardo da Vinci has a creepy robot he built roaming the streets:  that part is in keeping with the cartoons' regular use of anachronisms.

By the way, Sherman, who uses the word ""apocryphal"" on this movie to correct an urban legend/cultural myth, should also have learned that ""Let them eat cake"" was not spoken by Marie Antoinette.  Mr. Peabody should know his history better :-) !",1397433600,,2360,4.914141414141414

6189379,4,B00HNGZK6I,"In the trailer for ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman,"" the hyper-intelligent dog learns that his adoptive human son and a classmate have hijacked his time machine.  ""You used the WABAC?"" Mr. Peabody says. ""Yeah. She was into it,"" Sherman says.  Whoever edited this is a genius, creating a new joke by removing a few lines of dialogue from the final version of the actual scene (Sherman's friend was innocently ""into"" meeting George Washington) that had kids giggling at the characters' goofy expressions and adults laughing for a completely different reason. In the actual movie, sly double entendres like this aren't common, but there's still one type of humor aimed at kids and another aimed at the kids at heart in the audience.

""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is a full-length extension of the ""Peabody's Improbable History"" shorts co-created by Jay Ward to pad out Rocky & Bullwinkle episodes. The last couple of decades have seen a slew of other movies based on Jay Ward's creations. They were all occasionally funny but ultimately failures. So what makes ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" such an unmitigated success? First of all, it's completely CGI, allowing it to stay true to its cartoon roots while giving it a more modern feel at the same time. Secondly, it broadens the humor of the original rather than just trying to imitate it, and it injects some real heart into the story.

Mr. Peabody is an almost flawless character. Not only is he a genius scientist, inventor, and action hero, but he's an exceptional host. (If you ever nab Mr. Peabody for one of your cocktail parties, be sure to have him mix up his specialty drink, the ""Einstein on the Beach"".) His skills are practically limitless. But when Peabody discovers Sherman as an abandoned baby and legally adopts him, he finds out it's his parenting skills that still need work. He creates the time-travelling WABAC machine as a teaching aid for Sherman.

On his first day of public school, Sherman is naturally eager to show off his first-hand knowledge of history. This makes him very popular with some of his classmates, and earns him the ire of others, particularly queen bee Penny Peterson. Soon a fight breaks out, bringing the dog's rights to legally raise a human child into question. (There are obvious socio-political metaphors that can be read into this, and with good reason, but I'd advise you to check your personal agendas at the door and not go digging too deeply into a kid's movie, so you don't miss something wonderful going on at the surface.)

In an attempt to smooth things over, Peabody invites the Petersons to his penthouse for a dinner party. One thing leads to another, and faster than you can say ""Don't show her the WABAC"", Penny's ditched Sherman somewhere in history, and it's up to Peabody and Sherman to travel through time and space to fetch her.

Penny, a new character invented for the movie, adds a great new dynamic to the classic duo's time travels. She starts out comically self-centered, but it's not long before Sherman and the bully who made his first day of class agony develop their first crush on each other. Sherman's humility and compassion rub off on Penny, even as Penny's boldness and adventurousness rub off on Sherman. It makes for a satisfyingly sweet character arc for Penny, a cute coming-of-age story for Sherman, and an interesting opportunity for Peabody to come to terms with his boy reaching that age when he's more interested in spending time with girls than with his old man--er, dog.

The main relationship of the movie, though, is between the title characters.  The story is littered with some surprisingly poignant father-son moments. I found myself tearing up several times. My heart's not made of stone. But director Rob Minkoff strikes a perfect balance. Whenever the movie seems to be getting too maudlin, there's another great joke just around the corner to lighten the mood.

As expected with any Bullwinkle-related project, the movie's packed with plenty of groan-worthy puns. For example, Peabody's visit to Marie Antoinette becomes an excuse to quip, ""You can't have your cake and edict, too."" In a nod to how much humor has changed since the late 50's, Sherman invariably responds, ""I don't get it."" As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, there are different types of humor at play. For kids in the audience, Sherman is quick to point out in ancient Egypt that ""King Tut"" rhymes with ""butt"" and that you can't say ""booby trap"" without saying ""booby."" For adults in the audience, there's Peabody's puns, as well as some more clever wordplay. Also, recent pop culture informs both the film's humor and its kinetic action sequences. There's an homage to Zack Snyder's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-2006/dp/B000V39KDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300 (2006)</a>, set during the Trojan War, that I suspect is better than anything in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300-Rise-of-an-Empire-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-HD-UltraViolet-Combo-Pack/dp/B00BEJL6Q8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300: Rise of an Empire (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD UltraViolet Combo Pack)</a>, which was playing in the theater next door.

Ty Burrell does an appropriately brilliant job voicing Mr. Peabody, speaking with well enunciated syllables for as posh and intellectual of a cadence he can manage without slipping into a British accent, but also adding a warmth that radiates through every line. Max Charles' and Ariel Winter's naturally youthful voices keep them believable as Sherman and Penny. Stephen Colbert and Leslie Mann are both great as Penny's parents. Perhaps the film's only misstep is criminally under-using them. Patrick Warburton is hilarious as usual, with the movie's version of Agamemnon playing to his strengths as a likable meathead.

""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" is an amazing family movie. Don't have a family? A couple of the friends I went to see the movie with had their kids in tow, but I probably would have enjoyed it just as much if they weren't there. Not familiar with the source material? My memories of ""Peabody's Improbable History"" were vague at best. This reboot makes a great new introduction to the characters. It tugs at the heartstrings and tickles the funny bone. I just hope there are still plenty of adventures to come for this dog and his boy, and their new gal pal. Or, as Mr. Peabody would say, I hope they prove quite ""paw-pular.""",1395273600,2,6453,5.135238095238095
6189380,5,B00HNGZK6I,"I love animated films as, in my opinion, it is a genre that truly displays the level of care and work put into a film. The depth and quality of animation is usually a great sign. Now, I've been really happy with the releases from the past couple of months (Frozen, Lego Movie, Wind Rises) and from the looks of it, once How to Train Your Dragon 2 comes and goes, we may be in a lull for another couple of months.

Moving on, I went and saw this movie not because I was dragged by children (kids were out of house for weekend), nor because I held sentimental or nostalgic value for the characters, but because it seemed like it'd be a nice, well-written film. Unlike the recent revamp of classic characters (Chipmunks, Yogi, Smurfs), this film doesn't try and blend CGI characters into a live world, instead going for a completely animated world that allows me to not get pulled out every five minutes thinking how the actors were trying to play off non-existent co-stars. That alone is a plus, but I'm going to continue.

Now, the plot is simple. Peabody's a genius, adopts a boy, they go through adventures in time. Simple, yet provides so much room for an amazing story and great supporting characters. The story starts with Peabody (a more likable, only somewhat distant version of himself from the old series) and Sherman already in the middle of an adventure that ultimately doesn't have any importance in the overall plot of the film but does a great job of establishing the routine of these characters and their roles (Peabody the clever genius teaching his son about history and other areas of knowledge such as fencing and Sherman the well-meaning if somewhat clumsy boy who has the utmost faith in his father). We then move on to Sherman's first day of school, which is where the actual plot begins. I won't spoil it, plus other reviews probably do so go read those if you want more information.

I'm never one for the father-son relationship, but I really enjoyed these characters and, as opposed to the stories where the son is distant and the father is reaching out, Sherman clearly loves his adoptive father and looks up to him. Peabody, while having a hard time using the word love or expressing it through words, also clearly cares for the boy. The conflict comes from an outside force, the character of Penny, an unlikable classmate of Sherman's who I grew to tolerate as she was the one with the most change in the film and even gave Sherman a boost of confidence Peabody unintentionally didn't know he needed.

The humour is grand and like the other latest animated films isn't restrictively aimed at children, though there are some poop jokes sprinkled throughout to keep them amused as we chuckle at Clinton's one-liner and Peabody coming to keep Sherman from interacting with his past self in what is most certainly a masturbation joke. This isn't to say it's one of those films that is all adult humour in the worst ways, such as Nut Job. They're just the occasional wink to the audience that appease those that have the opinion they'd be better off in the cinema over watching 300. In general, as I, a person who has the driest of humour, this film was more win than lose. Animation is fine, and Dreamworks as usual doesn't make the 3D obvious if you view the film in it's regular 2D format.

From the looks of trailers following this, we are certainly in for some rough patches in animated films for a little while, aside from Dragon 2. It's understandable given how long these films take and considering Disney just released one, and Dreamworks is doing two right now. So this is definitely one to see before that dark period.",1395100800,2,3652,4.612307692307692
6189381,3,B00HNGZK6I,"Having grown up watching the original cartoon, I was a bit disappointed in the film. That is not to say kids won't enjoy it, but an old guy like me will just shake his head. On the plus side of the coin is the modern animation. They managed to keep the pun aspect of the cartoon, although my selective memory believes the older cartoon was more intellectual in that regard, On the negative side was the voices. I didn't like them. Sherman was okay, but not great. Peabody sounded like ""Uncle Martin"" from ""My Favorite Martian"" trying to imitate someone on ""The Big Bang Theory."" Hint: They named the blond ""Penny.""

Sherman ends up developing feelings for the most contemptible girl in school simply because she is blond with big blue eyes. When social services shows a prejudice against a dog adopting a boy, even though the court approved it, I couldn't help think there was an underlying message for child viewers that ""different"" parents can adopt children too. Not that I am against gay people adopting children, I just thought it was interesting for the creators of the film to introduce this side bar.

I did like Ariel Winter as the voice of Penny.

6189383,5,B00HNGZK6I,"Saw ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman 3D"" last Saturday morning with Jeff H.
Both of us were surprised at how much we actually liked ""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" - which is a basic love story between a father and his son, who just happen to be two misfits themselves.
Mr. Peabody is perhaps the ultimate misfit.  He's a brilliant scientist who was rejected as a puppy because nobody wanted and appreciated a smart dog after being abandonded at the puppy adoption agency.  He becomes a pop culture icon, who just happens to find an abandonded baby in an alley one day - Sherman.
Mr. Peabody goes to court and wins the right to adopt Sherman as his own son.  At one point, Mr. Peabody angrily tells a meancing social worker after Sherman bit a bully at school - ""The courts affirmed my rights to adopt Sherman."" - an analogy I wonder about inter-racial and gay adoptions and the societial struggles those families go through at the hands of an unapproving public sometimes.
Mr. Peabody loves Sherman and Sherman loves Mr. Peabody.  Mr. Peabody  built his greatest invention - the WABAC Machine - out of his love for his son and the desire to teach him how to prevent the mistakes of history.  Mr. Peabody has high aspirations for Sherman.
Natuarally Sherman, to impress Penny, the girl bully that he bit, shows her the WABAC machine and takes her for a little joy ride which goes horribly wrong, and Mr. Peabody and Sherman must work together for the first time as a family unit to resolve the issue.
""Mr. Peabody & Sherman"" does take a few liberties with the established cannon of the original cartoon segement of ""The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show,"" but it does so in a way adds new depth while staying true to the original.  If only Hollywoood would do this more often.
I think Mom and Dad would have liked this movie.
Highly Recommended!
