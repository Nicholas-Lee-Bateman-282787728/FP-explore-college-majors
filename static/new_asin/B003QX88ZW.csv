4172078,5,B003QX88ZW,"""He gave me lots of good memories. But I want more from him. I pester him after his death, and beg for more."" -- Hiroko

Like snow falling from heaven, the delicate white flakes covering the world below, so this wistful film from Japan blankets the viewer in layers of quiet and tender magic. Much like Korea's Ditto, a serene beauty frames a slowly developing story of subtle emotional depth for those patient enough to appreciate something special and reap the rewards. Beautifully shot in winter by cinematographer Noboru Shinoda, a gentle mood is set amidst a Japan of snow and rural beauty. It is a restful backdrop to the story of a love hanging on after death for one girl and a moment missed in youth by another which are inextricably linked in a way only revealed in the final moments. Miho Nakayama's winsome performance in a dual role is the framework upon which writer and director Shunji Iwai builds his simple yet elegant tale of longing and love just out of reach. It very much, in fact, has the feel of many Korean romanticist efforts. Rather than try to overwhelm the viewer with the beauty of a flower garden, writer and director Shunji Iwai chooses instead to focus our attention on the quiet and minute details of a single flower bud as it ever so slowly blooms. It creates a subtle depth more memorable for those willing to stop and watch his film unfold so they can simply say, in the end: ""That was beautiful.""

The snow drenched vistas of Japan in the west and north captured by cinematographer Noboru Shinoda's camera bring to the story the same hush the snow brings to the world. It begins at a memorial service where we learn that Wantanabe Hiroko (Miho Nakayama) is still unable to move on two years after the climbing accident which took the life of the man she was to marry. Akiba (Etsushi Toyokawa) was his friend but loves Hiroko as well, hoping she can break free from her grief and begin to live once again. Discovering a junior high yearbook with his old address at his mother's house, she writes a short note and mails it to Itsuki Fujii, knowing both he and the house only exist now in the minds and hearts of those who remember him. To her shock, however, she receives a reply, and Hiroko, unsure at first whether the letters are from heaven or just someone playing a cruel joke, begins to correspond with Itsuki. In a dual role, as the equally confused girl with a terrible cold who receives Hiroko's strange note, Nakayama is marvelous in her subtle shading to contrast the differences between two girls who look the same.

Words on cherry blossoms and spring finally lead to the realization that this Itsuki is simply a girl with the same name. Hiroko is at first devastated that the tenuous connection to her Itsuki has been broken, but decides to keep writing. Itsuki is battling a severe cold and memories of her father's death are poignantly mingled with the smaller revelations regarding the deeper connection both she and Hiroko have to a boy too internalized to express his love outwardly either in his school days or as a young man. A dragonfly in the snow, and the checking out of books by a young man who likes to write his own name take on a deeper meaning as Itsuki relates all she knew about Itsuki Fujii. Those memories will take both on a journey where each will pass like ships in the snowy night, yet never touch, mirroring a startling discovery brought Itsuki by a group of girls from the same school both Itsuki's attended. Never has the back of a library card held as much tenderness, or been as moving, as when this one is turned over. It is moments such as this which make this film so special, and utterly beautiful.

Shedding her coat like the grief keeping her from moving forward with her life, Hiroko will finally find her freedom shouting at the snowy mountain which took Itsuki from her. After a near tragedy, the delivery of a book to Itsuki brings about an understanding of why the connection between the girls was so strong. Tender and sensitive, this film is like a snow globe to first love, causing a smile with each new turn, until the entire scene is revealed. Delicate and touching, with an emotional shading by Miho Nakayama soft like the snowy backdrop to this lovely postcard to regret and understanding, this beautiful film is a must see for fans of Asian cinema. A lovely score from Remedios fits perfectly with the special mood created by director Iwai. Miki Sakai is terrific as the young female Itsuki, and Takashi Kashiwabara nicely portrays the young male Itsuki. A film of warmth and compassion, and substance rather than flash, elegant in its simplicity, it is another memorable film from Asia you will not easily forget.",1337212800,4,4711,4.6181384248210025

8402665,5,B003QX88ZW,"I find it difficult to improve on the great review written previously, the ""Snow laden Masterpiece"", as they say most of what I would say here.  If you love Asian movies, particularly Japanese, this one is one of the finest because of it's depiction of the heartache of the loss of a loved one.  No Samurai sword battles, just scene after scene of the stages of the human heart in a search to connect.
Gorgeously shot in Japan, with twists of plot accomplished with great skill, I recommend it highly.  P.S. if you love movies with lots of snow, this is also one for you!",1355875200,3,571,4.419047619047619
