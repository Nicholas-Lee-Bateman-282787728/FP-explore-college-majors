If you can sit through 12hours of this, you won't be disappointed if you live to ride or a road bike freak as myself. Its contagious!",1391644800,,276,4.653061224489796

8149974,5,B000JCDQYG,"The tour is masterfully called by Liggett and Sherwen, as always. The production value, like all of the World Cycling Productions DVD's is wonderful, as always. However, this TdF is amazing, and will set itself apart for stages 16 and 17 forever.

If you do or don't believe Landis is guilty (his book is also excellent: Positively False), it doesn't matter in watching this. From the very beginning in 2006, the biggest of the big names are gone from the tour before it ever starts: 2006 Winner of the Giro (about a month before), Ivan Basso, and of course, perennial #2 Jan Ullrich, not to mention the entire Astana team. (13 riders in all)

It was a strange tour from the outset, but all the usual excitement in bunch sprints and mountain stages. Stay tuned, when the discs roll around to Stage 16 to La Toussuire, and stage 17 to Morzine.... well, lets just say you won't probably see anything like that, ever again. Worth the price of admission.

as a final thought, the 12 hour DVD has much more mountain footage, which is just gorgeous and exciting, but also some commentary and pieces you will not get in the 4 hour version. I have watched both, and the 12 hour version is worth the time and the money for the upgrade.",1234224000,4,1226,4.513513513513513
