2630493,5,B000H7JCEG,"For the first 3 seasons, CSI: Miami was hindered by occasional clunky and uninteresting crimes and lack of character development.

But in Season 4, this show really takes off by adding subplots that set it apart from the other CSI shows and make the characters more interesting.

You now know Eric Delko has a sister who has cancer that he's helping get pot for. You see Ryan Wolfe's love and dedication to his job through the storyline involving a threat to his eyesight. Even coroner Alexx Woods has a meaty episode in which she's given an opportunity to work with another team.

These storylines are merely a backdrop to the thrilling cliff-hangers the writers/producers cooked up for this year: the identity of the mole in the lab and the continuing war against the Mala Noches.

All of these arcs are so well-handled that you'll be on the edge of your seat until the final episode of this season.",1158537600,18,901,4.6835443037974684

2630554,5,B000H7JCEG,"Enjoying season 4 and also the voice over from the directors.  I will say that the director's monolog, a bonus on the CD set, sometimes inadvertently divulge too much and take away from my fantasy world about CSI Miami.

I simply adore this show.  I love David Caruso as Horatio and his endearing chemistry with all of his co-workers within the series.  I also loved that they were not afraid to show Horatio's belief in God and how deeply he was saddened whenever a child or baby was harmed.  I found that incredible considering the usual jaded atheist BS we are spoon fed.  I appreciate that the writers kept Horatio the same throughout the entire series.  He was a good man, a caring and honest man, someone the younger co-workers on the show looked up to and considered a father figure even if they were near enough to his age.  Some people have an old soul and I think the show exemplified that characteristic in the character of Horatio Cain.

David Caruso was the perfect Horatio.  I loved this character and how David played him on the show.  The writers sometimes confused me with his absence of affection or any gooey affection with his wife Marisol, but obviously he adored her and one is led to believe they had a wonderful private relationship behind the scenes and he was primarily in the role of protector and companion, but this was sort of a not necessary plot line.  The only good thing about it was that it made Horatio and Delko truly brothers as in brothers-in-law which oddly was never referenced in the show.

My very favorite episodes were the truly campy Miami beautiful but sleazy people doing completely stupid things that got them killed or killing someone for totally self serving reasons.  It's the Miami persona on steroids.  So fun to watch.  Who doesn't enjoy looking at beautiful people who are so screwed up but lovable all the same...  South Florida, anything can happen.  Mostly immoral but from a distance, extremely entertaining.  It's all good.  For the record, my all time favorite episode making the most of the beautiful but mentally challenged was the bottle girl and football star wannabe whose agent was the perfect sleaze.",1441843200,,2169,4.718085106382978

2630564,3,B000H7JCEG,"Season 4 of CSI:Miami wasn't bad, although it really pushes the envelope with some of the soapy subplots including the huge, somewhat convoluted drug/cancer/Marisol/Delko/marriage/death story line. In many ways there were parts of the rushed marriage/death episodes that seemed a little too familiar to the Sonny Crocket quick-marriage/quick-death from the later seasons of Miami Vice, of which this series often seems to pay direct/indirect tribute to. The Mala Noche subplot was an interesting direction (again, reminiscent of Mimai Vice and General Lao Li moving his drug business to Miami - many parallels.) I'm realizing that while I find most of the secondary characters very artificial, it's really David Caruso who carries this show, and is probably the main reason I've been working through this series. He's just completely convincing in everything he does in this series and to me just carries the weight of the show. As for the rest, it can grow a little tiresome at how gorgeous, slender and perfect everyone in the crime lab looks, but I guess that's what you'd expect from prime time",1423180800,,1098,5.174157303370786
2630565,4,B000H7JCEG,"I am a fanatical fan of the crime scene programs such as the NCIS series and the CSI series, as well as BONES, CASTLE and THE MENTALIST.
And while the NCIS series deals with crimes committed within the Navy and Marines; the CSI deal with more ""routine"" style criminal behavior.  I have watched the entire CSI NY and all of the CSI Las Vegas episodes on DVD or Video Library and love them to death.  This Miami series is
the latest ones I have started (I have all the 10  seasons) and while I find  the stories well written, acted and photograph (and enjoy them), I think
as I have stated in previous reviews find the weakness in the programs in  the casting.  David Caruso is excellent as a Gibbs type of Boss (Caine)
and tough as nails but also very compassionate to the victims of the criminals.  The fellow playing Ryan I like; looks strangely familiar as if I have
seen him on another show.  Blondie (Emily Procter) I have mixed feelings; sometimes I like her; sometimes I find her extremely annoying.  She
sometimes speaks with a very squeaky voice like Jill Ireland.  Sometimes she speaks so low and I can hardly hear her or understand her.  And
I am partial to Brunettes anyhow; I do not like bleached blonds.  Still, she is promising, though I never seen her anywhere else.
  Delko I don't like: he is a arrogant fellow who had frequented prostitutes in one episode and purchased ""maryjane"" for his sister who was suffering
from chemotherapy treatments for leukemia.  Not appropriate behavior for a cop, though one is sympathetic to his sisters problems.  She does
apparently recover however.  Caine warned him to  stop but did not report him or fire him.  I am a rabid enemy of illegal drug use of any kind; I
don't even like to take aspirin unless I really need to.  The woman cast as the Forensic Pathologist is excellent.
  Still, the stories are for the most part very excellent;  New photographic effects have been introduced making the visuals even for impressive.
I never been to Florida but am impressed by the beauty of Miami.  Miami reportedly has the third largest skyline outside of NY and Chicago,
and being from NY I am amazed and surprised by what I saw.  Photography through out all the CSI series is impressive, and I don't impress
easily.  Anyhow, in this set of DVDs there are some really  good action that will keep one awake.  The final episodes of the series are really
great, though there are some tear jerking moments.  Caine even gets married.
  I give this season 4, FOUR STARS.  If they improve the overall cast, I would make it FIVE easily.  Get a Brunette with BLUE EYES!
  NOTE:  Being a BONES (and Emily Deschanel fan) I was wondering what has happened to the series; one word is that she is having another
baby; good for her but us Bone-a-holics miss  her and the show.  Note: I  get all my DVDS from Amazon or the programs put on my Amazon
Video Library....Enjoy!

2630613,3,B000H7JCEG,"In the fourth season, CSI Miami began to deviate from the successful formula that they had developed in the first three.  Some key elements were retained: the striking visuals, with sunlit exteriors, azure-blue ocean vistas, and pastel colors (reminiscent of Miami Vice).  David Caruso's low key delivery projects a quiet strength.  The major change was sub-plots about the personal lives of the characters, which tended to detract from main thrust of the story lines.  The scripts were a bit uneven.  There were some outstanding episodes, and some that were completely implausible.  This series was always at its best when the scripts concentrated on plot and evidence, which unfortunately, was not always the case in the fourth season.",1350000000,,737,5.256410256410256
2630614,3,B000H7JCEG,"Wow, I was so glad to see the Marisol character killed off in season 4. What a load of crapola the writers gave us in her character. Marisol, the model like beauty/super fox is dying of Leukemia, or actually she is in remission I think at the end of season 4. Horatio Caine has pity on the super fox, sister of the brother Delko.

I don't know about this show. The show creates these episodes around some of the most repugnant people I have ever seen. Miami comes off like the Biblical city of Sodom. When many of these characters die I'm just happy to see them go. But Noooooooooooo, CSI has to come in and investigate the deaths of these pathetic immoral people.

Of interest in Season 4 is the Mala Noche. It is also fun to say ""Mala Noche"". I enjoyed characters Delko and Wolfe. Cally Duchane though just seems to be so snotty and smug. I can't stand her character. I also like the other two female characters in the lab. I wish they got more air time. One of those gals turned out to be the MOLE though. I hope we see her again past season four. I also don't care for Delko's sexaul appetite. The characters and the people of Miami are just way too immoral for me. The show is all about rich people having sex. Rich people wearing fine clothes, going to spas, getting tans, wearing jewelry, driving awesome cars, obsessing about their bodies and their looks. These Miami types also take lots of drugs, heroin, cocaine, ecstasy, marijuana, speed, etc, etc, etc. All in all this show is one big ho hum to me. I don't care for the lack of morality in the show. Everyone is superficial. And the crime lab keeps finding trace evidence on the clothes of people days or weeks after the actual crime. How can these people still be wearing the same clothes? I could understand if the clothes were held as evidence. That would make sense. But that is not how the show usually plays out. It's just a good thing that I only paid $10 for seasons 3 and 4. For a top rated show it sure is lacking a lot in content.",1344124800,,2004,4.298941798941799

2630617,5,B000H7JCEG,"It is such fun comparing CSI LV and CSI Miami. The sun&sea show is so obviously centered around Horatio Caine's personality (while the original CSI is not). I love the quiet danger that surrounds Caruso's personality - he plays a walking proof of the old psychological saying that quite a  lot of military and police are on the right side by their own choice - but could be on the other side by their abilities.
Going to try CSI NY - interesting what Harry Cinise did with his hero.

One of the real perks of the CSI Miami is the city itself - one of the most beautiful cities in the world, photographed well.",1283731200,,609,4.333333333333333

2630620,4,B000H7JCEG,"CSI Miami is, according to Reuters, ""the most-watched U.S. series around the world"", and one can easily understand why.

American TV shows have been a vehicle used to spread and promote the American way of life (occasionally while glorifying it) for years. In my opinion, no other show conveys the essence of the American dream better than CSI Miami - and that's the source of its phenomenal success.

Police work and life in general have never looked so attractive and fulfilling; Florida, what a beautiful land, even more when all the females you ever get to see (cast members or random passers-by) are top models. The cars the police officers drive are fancy Hummers, the equiptment used for the CSI work is always on the top of the line. Most of the crimes are committed in the best and wealthiest neighborhoods, mostly by - you must have guessed - handsome/beautiful, charming and occasionally rich criminals. The poor victims seem almost good looking on their deathbeds. Add to that the amazing speed in which justice is served (usually within 40 minutes), and you get the most easily watched syndicated program in the history of television.

It should be noted that the creators of the show do not shy away from planting the expected crimes in places in which sometimes the most unusual, disturbing and bizarre types of behaviors found within the American society happen; from getaway promiscuous parties for bored wives, to arranged dates for men with shameless gold diggers going to one night stand meetings for men and willing women, and so forth. These outrageous and often sensational plot contexts undoubtly contribute to the appeal of the series no less than all the other elements.

The entertainment-value of the final outcome is undisputable. I've seen many episodes and was never bored or indifferent. The stories are interesting, engaging and fast-paced. David Caruso, the leading actor, plays well, has the necessary charisma and is famous for employing special mannerisms like no other. Even so, there's a downsize; when everything is said and done, more often than not, there is no special memory left in mind, there isn't a deep lesson, moral or intellectual stimulation that leaves its mark. Not much remains other than the general atmosphere of things which is -- a sort of a representation or maybe a taste of the American dream.",1189209600,2,2355,4.984732824427481
2630621,4,B000H7JCEG,"What is most remarkable about season 4 is the amount of human interest and character development  it offers. Horatio falls in love (without wanting to spoil anything there is - as is to be expected - no happy end).
Eric DELKO has a streak of bad luck - he is  suspect in a narcotics investigation, he is in debt and his sister has cancer (on top of that she is also witness of a robbery turned awry - see episode DRIVEN).  He also has a brief romance with new lab girl, Natalia Boa VISTA (love that name), a most welcome addition to the cast. Not only is her character charming, actress Eva LA RUE also looks gorgeous.
While I did not like his character in the previous season, this time  I got used to Ryan WOLFE (Jonathan TOGO). The poor guy also gets shot with a nail gun (!) in the eye in the NAILED episode; his impaired vision will cause him lots of trouble on the job. Additional conflicts concern an annoying female reporter (a recurring character) and the crush Calleigh DUQUESNE's has on a Secret Service agent (this guy also starred in the last but one season, if I remember correctly).
So there is a lot in store for the characters in this season. As if all of  this
was not enough  there is a mole  in the crime lab and a  federal investigation is underway...
All in all I had the impression that the series is more action driven than previous seasons; particularly Horatio gets to use his gun often. A recurring theme of season 4 is the fight against the powerful and ultra-violent South American gang Mala Noche (clearly inspired by real life gang MS 13).
I also would like to give kudos to actor Rex LINN, who is great as detective Frank TRIPP. Mr. LINN knows how to portray a tough cop!
My favorite episode of season 4 is URBAN HELLRAISERS, which has juvenile criminals re-enacting a GTA-like computergame in real life. In my book a real innovative story!
The Miami locations are put to great effect as usual, this time even including a cruise ship (OPEN WATER). And I really loved the sharks!
I have mixed feelings about some episodes due to a certain slant. Take for instance 28 HOURS TO LIFE, where a young black named Tobey HOLLINS is cleared of  not only one, but two murders. First he is arrested for the murder of a white woman on a yacht, only to be accused in jail of a second murder (this time of a white inmate). It turns out that the woman was shot by the yacht's  prospective buyer and the prisoner was stabbed to death (with a sharpened turkey bone!) in self-defense. HOLLINS had priviously been the victim of male rape at the hand of the white prisoner. It is hard to believe that with CSI's reputation for getting all forensic/criminalistic facts right the episode's writer should not be aware of the fact that prison rape is more or less exclusively black-on-white ... That said 28 HOURS TO LIFE with its meandering storyline, which keeps you guessing throughout, and an admittedly convincing performance by the black actor, is gripping entertainment.
There are also some rather too far fetched story contrivances (e.g. two snipers, operating indepently and for different reasons at the same time at the same crime scene in the episode RAMPAGE).
And I really would love to see an episode in CSI MIAMI at least once, where the crime turns out to be a freak accident, as is regularly the case in Vegas or New York.
As usual, there are not that much extras, but they are welcome. The three featurettes detail the brainstorming, scriptwriting and preproduction process, art direction, location scouting, set building and dubbing. Really interesting stuff! Running time for the documentaries is a bit over 40 minutes.
All in all required viewing for the CSI MIAMI fan, despite political correctness and other shortcomings!",1188432000,,3751,4.618618618618618
2630622,4,B000H7JCEG,"This season brought more of the characters together through a mole in the office. Once that is revealed in the last episode you have to say ""YES!"" I almost couldn't wait to find out who it was and watched the ending! A strange love triangle was started...not too crazy about that and then the other love interest that is started half way through the season ends badly, and I mean badly. It was the most disappointing part of the season. Still a good show and I can't wait 'til season five is released!",1183507200,,501,4.397849462365591
2630623,5,B000H7JCEG,"One of my favorite things about CSI: Miami is how it ""remembers"" what happened weeks, months, and even years before--and how it rewards long-time viewers who remember the show's history.  Few other television shows in the past (though more recently have started this trend) have required the ""cultural capital"" about their own show to fully appreciate the intricacies of each episode.  Obviously I couldn't have predicted the final few episodes and found each one was better than the next--I had actually missed the season five opener when it was broadcast, so I downloaded it from Unbox.  I just had to see the resolution with Horatio and Riaz.",1180396800,2,645,5.009345794392523

2630625,2,B000H7JCEG,"I occasionally watch CSI to point out the mistakes in the ""science"".  I grew to enjoy the original series because the characters were done so well, even if the science is iffy.  CSI-Miami, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  A friend of mine bought this for me because I watch the original show.  My problem with this show?  1st of all, if Eric Delco was working in a real lab and bought marijuana, he would have been fired!!!  No questions asked or explanations accepted!!  I hate Delco's character.  He gets away with so much borderline behavior that this show becomes unrealistic.  As a matter of fact, this entire lab would lose their accreditation and all of these labbies would be unemployed.  Give me a break!!!",1178496000,3,720,4.642857142857143
2630626,3,B000H7JCEG,"I really like this show and - for the most part - enjoyed watching this season on dvd, so why so harsh a rating? Well, I wanted to give this 3.5 stars, but the rating system doesn't allow for that; and there's too much wrong with it to give four stars. And I want this rating to be a signal about the serious dip in quality of the fourth season.

What's wrong with it? Well, for starters, CSI: Miami has turned way too much into the Horatio Caine-show. Granted, he's the main character, but CSI:Miami is about solving crimes through CSI-methods, not Caine running around shooting bad guys; this isn't Miami Vice, episode writers!

Still, the visual style of the episodes is simply amazing (my main reason for wanting to give it that extra .5 stars) and most of the story-lines are superb. But why spoil it by adding a ridiculous soap-opera romance between Caine and Delco's sister? I mean, come on, he's old enough to be her father and there's absolutely no chemistry between them. At least make it believable by having it be someone closer to his own age! And we all know how it will end by the end of the season... no surprises there. And then there is the switch to Miami Vice-style shoot-outs between Caine and 'the bad guys'. A dozen automatic weapons-toting thugs start blazing away at him, but he survives without a scratch and takes them out one by one with his gun? Almost every episode he kills a couple of criminals and his shootings don't get reviewed by IA? Come on, I know it's television but this is CSI; it's supposed to be as realistic as possible (just watch CSI, sixth season, for what happens in a cop-involved shooting).

Still a great show I will continue to watch - and order on dvd - so I hope the next season(s) will return to the level of quality of the first three seasons.",1172966400,,1800,4.448484848484848

2630628,3,B000H7JCEG,"I don't get CSI here in the single-TV-channel boondocks, so I rely on ""complete package"" DVD's to keep up with my favourite crime dramas like CSI & L&O. Hitherto I have been a loyal fan of CSI Miami. My neighbour told me he had given up watching CSI Miami (though he still enjoys Las Vegas & NY versions) because it was getting more like a soap opera than a cop show. I ignored him and bought the set anyway. After viewing 16 of the episodes on this set, I have to agree. I find myself so annoyed by the sulky petulence of Delko & the discarded women in his wake; & the beauteous yet utterly unrealistic Marisol whom Horatio marries that I can hardly concentrate on the crime being investigated. Marisol looks like she had weathered all the ravages of a hang-nail, rather than cancer & chemotherapy. (As a cancer survivor, I ought to know).

The two leading women, Emily Proctor & Khandi Alexander, could have phoned in their parts; they seem barely noticeable amid the bickering of the other characters. And someone ought to tell David Caruso that black is not his colour.

My advice to the producers; if you want to stay in business, fire last season's writers, cut the maudlin crap and get back to the high standards of season 1 & 2.",1168819200,2,1236,4.464601769911504
