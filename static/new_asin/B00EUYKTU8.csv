5944878,5,B00EUYKTU8,Great story line--even if your american and not mexican. I hung onto each chapter with its twist and changes. I really enjoyed this and watched it with my wife who is spanish. Since it came with sub titles it was easy to understand the story lines. I highly recommend this dvd.,1417305600,,277,4.450980392156863
5944879,3,B00EUYKTU8,"Corona de Lagrimos (Crown of Tears - 903 minutes)

This lives up to its title: Victoria Ruffo stars and she is the queen of tears. The third time one of her sons says, ""Don't cry, Mama!"" I echoed their sentiments! As I watched the schemes of her ambitious oldest son Patricio (Alejandro Nones)  I was reminded of Walter Scott's line: ""Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive."" Embarrassed by their poverty, this bright law student lies about his family, his address, his wardrobe and his lack of a car. On the other hand, his mother Refugio (Victoria Ruffo), is so tone-deaf she insists on showing up where she clearly is NOT wanted, causing him endless problems with his nasty new in-laws.

By Disco Dos, the plot becomes nicely complicated. Our heroine and all three of her sons have their own separate issues, as we see a wrongful job termination, a high-risk pregnancy, drug dealing, and unrequited love. (Round one of Who's Your Daddy?"" has been resolved.)

The villain, Rmulo Ancira (Ernesto Laguardia), is the cleverest, most manipulative, slyest lawyer I ever hope to see in action. Between him and his ever-present cigar, we are watching a professional in action! We can't help but admire the verbal traps he springs on his victims, smiling all the while.

His bi-polar daughter Olga (Adriana Louvier), set her sights on Patricio and got him, for better or for worse. Her powerful papa has made it very clear to his son-in-law what will happen if his darling daughter becomes unhappy.

By the time this is over, villains are vanquished, maternal is love restored, the family is reunited and we watch a happy christening, but we relish the treatment doled out to that hateful lawyer and hope there is more of it! That makes for a happy ending!",1408233600,,1776,4.75

Contiene un Buen Resumen de los Capitulos, con las partes ms importantes de la Historia, se omiten algunas Escenas pero a pesar de eso vale la pena verla.",1395792000,,199,4.882352941176471

5944886,4,B00EUYKTU8,"I stumbled upon Corona de Lagrimas online while trying to learn Spanish and immediately got hooked. And I'm totally NOT a soap opera, or even a TV drama, fan.
I've spent a few minutes looking at other telenovelas on television and they all look as much like Corona de Lagrimas as a US soap opera looks like Gone with the Wind.
These aren't pretty people striking dramatic poses, it's a brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and fantastically well shot drama a great look into real life today in Mexico City as the story compares the life of the ordinary single mom Refugio and her three nearly grown sons with the life of the super rich Ancira family into which Refugio's oldest son, Patricio, marries.
I'm not even into TV drama and I'm struck by how hard these actors work and how well they pull off complex characters, esp the woman who plays Olga, who plays her part as a near-psychotic perfectly, Patricio, who is a great actor not just a handsome face, Romulo, one of the best TV 'bad guys' ever, and Victoria Ruffo, who could make a stone cry.
The DVD's only fault is that it's a seriously edited down version from the original entire drama.
In any case, it's a great way to learn Spanish too!",1390780800,6,1201,4.539170506912442
5944887,4,B00EUYKTU8,"A fast paced mystery and great editing.  However, I think the editors left the romance on the ""cutting room floor"".  Victoria Ruffo portrays a mother with deep love for her three boys that led to dramatic, and sometimes ""over the top"" angst. (A lot of weeping in this movie) However, I overlooked that because of what the character had been through when the boys were young.  The sons have three distinct personalities and the separate roads in life that they take are thoroughly played out.  If your looking for sexy great looking male actors in this telenovela they are in the minority. The male actors depicted on the photo are the three sons.  The ploy that attracted me to this telenovela was the actor in the middle facing forward, and, unfortunately his role was not dominate.  There are various themes including verbal and physical abuse, mental illness and murder. The villain in this movie portrayed by the actor Ernesto Laguardia was the constant thread that effectively controlled everyone else.  The telenovela is worth watching Mr. Laguardia's acting skills.  The comebacks written for this actor are great!!!!!!!!

My review is coming from someone who is a telenovela fanatic looking at very sexy good looking actors that I do not find in my home country's (USA) movies.  I have every telenovela with English subs and a wish list of at least 40 more that do not!",1388880000,2,1377,4.846153846153846

8609677,5,B00EUYKTU8,"Amazing story. One of Victoria Ruffo's best lead role. The acting of Mane de la Parra, Jose Maria Torre & Alejandro Nones was on target & superb! Maribel Guardia & Africa Zavala were great! Of course Ernesto Languardia was deliciously wicked. The rest of the staff was on point and made for great story telling a la telenovela style. Won't regret purchasing it.",1463529600,,361,4.746031746031746
8609678,5,B00EUYKTU8,"A wonderful story with English subtitles. The only problem I have is that the DVD is extremely edited out compared to the TV show!!  When i first watched the DVD I honestly thought there was something wrong with it until I read another review about the editing. Why they did this I'll never know/? It's usually the other way around with the TV version being edited and you getting the full story on the DVD...not this time.  It can get very confusing because so much is edited out. I am currently watching it with my Mother and have to constantly explain to her why certain things are being said and why certain parts of the storyline are happening. They really leave ALOT of this story out on the DVD and some of the parts left out were good parts, explaining certain aspects of the storyline. If you're not bothered by the extra long commercials on the TV, then you are better off watching it there where you can at least get the full storyline.",1448841600,,947,4.436781609195402
