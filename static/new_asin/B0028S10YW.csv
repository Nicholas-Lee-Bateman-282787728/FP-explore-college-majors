8356865,5,B0028S10YW,My kids love this show and sing all the songs. I'm pretty impressed with the vocal talent of David and King Solomon especially. Goliath's song could be trimmed by about two minutes though. The (intentional) comedic relief is pretty great as well.,1473292800,,246,4.880952380952381

8356871,5,B0028S10YW,"This is our second ""Liken"" movie, and we really enjoyed it. If you are new to the ""Liken"" series, they are like a really good musical play, and are a bit silly and only follow the basics of the story line in the scriptures. My kids do prefer the ""Ester"" movie from the ""Liken"" series, but enjoy this one as well. So nice to have some great movies for them to watch on the Sabbath.
(Top three things I loved about this one: 3. Alex Boye plays a smaller role as one of David's brother's and it's fun to see him in a movie, he does a great job :)  2. Their portrayal of King Saul as a serious neurotic with persecution delusions, was, in my opinion, excellent and very true to the OT  3. There is an AMAZING duet between King Saul and David basically about feeling jaded by life and unable to overcome/vs/ being able to change yourself through the help of Jesus Christ, loved it!)",1385683200,3,877,4.214285714285714
8356872,5,B0028S10YW,The music was surprisingly well done.  The lyrics were meaningful and entertaining.  The singing was excellent!  The story is told in a thoughtful and fun way.  They stay true to the basic story line without getting into details that younger children don't need to know at this time.  I was able to show it to my 4th grade class without any worries of too much violence compared to other renditions.,1382918400,3,399,4.642857142857143
8356873,5,B0028S10YW,"I really enjoyed the film, but better than that, my children enjoyed it, it's a great way for them to learn there Bible stories, highly recommend the film.",1377561600,,155,4.571428571428571
