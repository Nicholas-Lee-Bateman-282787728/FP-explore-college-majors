8357593,4,B002970Y3A,"""Learn Guitar in 8 Weeks""

One private guitar lesson, $25 per half hour. One hour guitar lesson $40+?
One ""Learn Guitar in 8 Weeks"" DVD, less than the price of (1) half-hour guitar lesson ""Priceless"".

This is really basic guitar teaching, based on the possibility that the student just got a guitar as a gift and has little to no knowledge about playing guitar. After 8 weeks you are ready for those $25 per half hour lessons and have learned some basic skills, some playing skills and knowledge before you start investing your allowance money in paid lessons. You will learn the basic language about the guitar itself and guitar playing. You will learn scales, arpeggios, power chords, hammering etc and the encouragement necessary to progress. Jason gives you confidence that you can learn to play guitar. The lessons are basic, yet no so basic. Dedication, practice and work are necessary to move from lesson #1 and get to lesson #8.

Consider this DVD as a small investment into yourself. After 8 weeks you will know whether playing guitar is something that you really want to do and continue learning by private lessons.

My motivation to learn guitar was to be popular with my circle of friends and be in a band. I got both!

Spend the money on this DVD, learn to play guitar. Jason patiently teaches you the beginning skills to make that happen.",1389398400,,1353,4.716101694915254
8357594,5,B002970Y3A,Jason is such a great teacher because he makes you feel like you are capable of being successful. He breaks down things for you in such an understandable manner that isn't overwhelming. This is highly recommended for anyone who feels intimidated by learning guitar. Jason makes you feel like you can do it!,1379548800,,306,4.7924528301886795
8357595,3,B002970Y3A,"I've found it is often difficult to read and understand reviews for guitar courses.

Depending on whether you've ever touched a guitar, your idea of ""beginner"" varies. Some ""beginner"" reviewers have played piano for 10 years...

Depending on how you feel about reading music, your idea of starting material varies.

Ok - what's here is a nice short cut course to get you tuned, playing a handfull of chords, basic picking and strumming, and little of reading tablature.

Gets you up and playing in a short while, but of course there is no technical depth. Sure you can play an A Major chord, but we don't delve into WHAT makes it an A Major.

All in all a good start to get some chords and fretting experience.

If you prefer to start with reading music, not the best pick.

With Hal Leonard or Mel Bay, you can get printed material, cd's, DVD's, and a book to get you familiar with all the concepts you'll need your first couple years - for less money.

As a short cut to looking like you aren't clueless with a guitar - recommended.

As a short cut to playing whatever you want? Well, that don't exist.",1366934400,,1104,4.45273631840796
8357596,2,B002970Y3A,"This is an OK video to give you some pointers and get you started, but I do not think it has nearly enough material to stretch out over 8 weeks.

The video touches on the basics of a guitar, strumming, scales, chords, but not a lot of depth on any of it.

Ravi's Guitar in 21 Days was more helpful to me.  It had more drills and downloadable material to help supplement the video which I found very helpful.",1366416000,,407,4.1265822784810124
8357597,5,B002970Y3A,"Jason gave me this dvd as a gift a few years ago and I love it. Since I started I am playing songs I never dreamed possible.  He is an amazing teacher, so it only makes since that his dvd would work too. Thank you Jason for hooking me up with ability to jam with my brothers :) YOU ROCK!",1348099200,,287,3.783333333333333
8357598,5,B002970Y3A,"Jason takes a fundamental approach that allows you to learn the basics, as well as challenge yourself along the way. I have tried others, however, this one is a keeper. Great for all ability levels and ages, my 4 yr old loves sitting in!",1337299200,,237,4.409090909090909
8357599,5,B002970Y3A,"I just started week one today.  I'll admit that I cheated and checked out week two as well.  This is a really, really great way to learn to play guitar.  Jason explains every step clearly, beginning with different parts of the guitar, how to tune the guitar and some 'ladder' exercises to work on your finger agility as well as reading music.  I've had some failed attempts at learning how to play the guitar, but the way that Jason slowly and clearly explains each step is very effective.  I highly recommend checking this out!",1336953600,,528,4.574468085106383
