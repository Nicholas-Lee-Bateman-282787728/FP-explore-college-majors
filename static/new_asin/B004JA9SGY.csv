8431814,4,B004JA9SGY,"This DVD is exactly what it says: Time lapse video in high definition. The setting is one of the most beautiful places in the country, with different locals around the Sedona area.

There is no narrative and no music. Just occasional sounds of wind, chirping birds, and thunder.

The video capture is incredible in most instances, although in a few spots it switches from setting to setting a bit too rapidly.
If you've never been to Sedona, this DVD is an excellent 'primer'. It delivers more realism than photos or brochures. If you have been to Sedona, this DVD will take you back to some wonderful memories and keep you wanting to return.",1327795200,3,642,4.672566371681416
