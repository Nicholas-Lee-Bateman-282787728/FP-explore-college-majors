2888709,2,B000SQFC4K,"If you simply must buy anything with the words ""The Beatles"" on it because you're an obsessive Beatle fan, then buy The Unseen Beatles.  Otherwise, don't waste your time and money.

There is indeed some ""rare and previously unseen footage"" in this DVD, but it struck me that it was ""previously unseen"" because whoever took it or considered it for air time realized it didn't inform or entertain very much.  It didn't add anything new to our knowledge of The Beatles, their history or artistic significance.

As one of the aforementioned obsessive Beatle fans, I didn't learn anything new or gain any further insights into them.  ""The Beatles Anthology"" video would tell this story (plus the story of the rest of their career) just as well or better, and from The Beatles' perspective.

For a more objective, outsider's perspective, I recommend two excellent books: the very enjoyable ""Shout"" by Philip Norman, and ""The Beatles: The Biography"" by Bob Spitz, which is well-researched, unflaggingly honest, and thoroughly detailed.",1193443200,29,1028,5.125748502994012
2888710,3,B000SQFC4K,"Although there isn't anything really bad about THE UNSEEN BEATLES DVD, I have to give a three-star (it's OK) rating.

I was under the impression that this DVD was going to show the amateur footage from the last Beatles concert at San Francisco's Candle Stick Park that was filmed by a kid who was there all day long. It does show some of that footage, but the BBC documentary really explains the entire 1966 Beatles tour and how it was full of disasters.

There are present day (2007) interviews with people who were actually there including journalist Maureen Cleave who wrote the article that kicked off the whole Lennon ""Beatles are bigger than Jesus"" controversy back then.

It does show ample amateur footage, including interviews with the Beatles themselves from back then, and really explains why the Beatles finally decided to stop touring and playing concerts. They went through Hell in Japan and the Philippines, which is really the straw that broke the camel's back. It makes you wonder why so many corners were cut because they really had inadequate security, transportation, and the whole Tokyo debacle could've been avoided had Brian Epstein booked them at a different location. Anyway, once you watch this documentary you'll understand why Candle Stick Park was the last Beatle concert (until the very last one on top of the Apple building but that wasn't really a concert per se). The footage isn't the best quality, which is to be expected, but it's OK and won't interfere with viewing pleasure.

Again, the DVD is really interesting but I think if you're really looking for more quality stuff go with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beatles-Anthology/dp/B00008GKEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beatles Anthology</a>&nbsp;instead. That also shows footage from the last concert, but it's really cleaned up, and the set goes through the entire Beatles career. It costs more money but you get 5-DVDs, plus over 600-minutes of viewing time.

I also thought that some of the footage would show the opening acts, too, because I would've loved to see the Ronettes, without Ronnie, with Nedra singing lead, but it didn't.

Get it if you're a big Beatles fan and you like watching documentaries and news shows, but don't expect it to be earth shattering.

Color footage of the group, no sound, just some classical type music playing in the background. This is pretty cool because it shows them by the pool, relaxing and going to the airport and stuff.

2888712,5,B000SQFC4K,"I have long awaited seeing this footage of the Beatles' Swan Song Concert in San Francisco and this film was well worth the wait.  I admit and quite proudly so that I am an obsessive Beatles fan.  (Ain't nothing wrong with that!)  The footage is a treat for all hard core Beatles fans.

Readers board the Beatle train in 1963 when the Fabs were in Jersey.  Let's face it, fellow female Beatle fans - I caught you feasting your eyes on Paul's shirtless form!  And I KNOW many of you out there were throwing a party for your eyes when you saw George.  We all know George Harrison was fab and fine.  John's mock faces and Ringo and that adorable moptop toss added to the fun.

Grab your hats and head for San Francisco for the 1966 Swan Song Concert!  You get to see the Beatles in color along with other artist at Candlestick Park.  You also get treated to some interviews and press conferences.

This is a must have for ALL Beatles fans.  No doubt you will be singing along with them as you make that last stop on the concert train.

2888713,3,B000SQFC4K,"""The Unseen Beatles"" is a fascinating look at the group's chaotic touring history during 1963-66. After viewing this BBC documentary, one understands why the Fab Four spent their remaining years as a studio band. Featuring several first-person accounts and some rare footage (including home movies from the final concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park), the overall film reveals a darker, more harrowing portrait of Beatlemania - the flip side of ""A Hard Day's Night.""",1205280000,27,473,5.405405405405405

2888719,5,B000SQFC4K,"This dvd is obviously taken from a BBC documentary that was aired on British television, earlier this year, or late last year. I don't understand one reviewer's assesment that this footage has been seen, and the unseen footage was never shown because it has no entertainment value. That is ridiculous. If you are a Beatles fan you will enjoy seeing the rare home movies included in this small compilation. It is only 65 minutes long, and the price is right. It is a nice addition to your collection if you are so inclined to collect these things. And what fan of the group would not love to have little movies of Paul and John, hamming it up, by the pool.  Also, there are home movies made by a fan who attended their last concert at Candlestick Park in 1966. An interesting snippit of time is captured, as you watch people setting up for the concert. Also, there are extended interviews with people associated with the group, like Tony Bramwell, Larry Kane, and Allen Williams. Although they don't say anything earth shatteringly, new, it is still very interesting because they touch on things that have always been intriguing anyway. Allen Williams in particular is not his usual sour grapes, woe is me, self. He actually seems to acknowledge how lucky he was to have known the group, and worked with them, and he also gives interesting observations. Tony Bramwell says, and has said before, that the Beatles had no responsibility. Their's was a carefree existance. This seems to miss the point, because although they didn't have to be at a nine to five job, they did have to be somewhere all the time, and the demands placed on them, especially the two songwriters, were 100 times more stressful than what a regular joe would experience. The fact that they were so proffessional at such a tender age, adds to their appeal. I only saw this dvd once so far, but I enjoyed it. I was pleasantly surprised by it's interresting content. Especially since it was so inexpensive. It makes a great stocking stuffer, or a nice little addition to your Beatles dvd collection. I say, ""Why not?""",1196812800,8,2084,4.693989071038251
