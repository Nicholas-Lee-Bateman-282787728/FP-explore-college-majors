1236322,2,B00000JPRS,"I'm very disappointed in this video.  It's very fast moving (I guess that's what ""power"" means) and in the second half of the video, the postures are so advanced (hopping from one pose to another, positioning your legs OVER your shoulders from behind and balancing your entire weight on your hands).  I think Rodney Yee has lost track of what is a ""beginners"" tape (somebody get this man a dictionary).  You either have to be extremely advanced to complete this and do all the poses -- or else you have to be double jointed!  Anybody want to buy my tape -- cheap???",990230400,,565,4.509803921568627
1236323,3,B00000JPRS,"This is not for beginners... although he says at the beginning to use variations he gives no variations(or explanations) on any of the poses throughout the video.  It moves so quickly from one pose to the next that unless you know what you are doing you are going to be thouroughly confused. I expected more from a workout the was supposed to be ""for beginners"".",989193600,8,362,4.569230769230769
1236324,5,B00000JPRS,"I found Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for Beginners frustrating the first time through, however, once I learned the routine I found it challenging, relaxing, and perfect for those mornings when I don't have a lot of time.  The routine is only 25 minutes long and packed with all the right yoga moves.",985219200,8,294,4.653846153846154
1236325,5,B00000JPRS,"I love this tape. The first couple times you may feel rushed, but once you get the hang of where he's going, you will be able to do it and feel the full benefits. Rodney Yee is very calming and relaxing, and his tapes are addicting. You'll get better and better every time you do it.",980380800,2,283,4.071428571428571
1236326,2,B00000JPRS,"This tape was definitely too hard for me.  I now understand that it's beginner's Power Yoga, but the word ""beginners"" in the title is a bit misleading.  I'm not in the best shape, but I usually push myself to finish a video, but I couldn't do it with this one.  I can't do push-ups, and I couldn't think of a reasonable alternative to get from one pose to the next.  I'll try again, but maybe after getting a beginner's Yoga (not Power) video.",1049587200,5,443,4.301204819277109
1236327,5,B00000JPRS,This is currently my favorite 20 minute tape.  I often pop it (or other Rodney Yee 20-minute beginner tapes) into the VCR as I'm struggle to wake up in the morning.  Nothing like forward bends to get the blood to rush to my head and it's really challenging to work through all the morning stiffness.  I feel energized all day and I think I stand straighter too.,1047859200,2,361,4.358208955223881
1236328,5,B00000JPRS,"This video may be too challenging for a very first yoga tape, but after a few times through it, I noticed increased flexibility--something I thought impossible for me.  It is about 25 minutes which is what I like best about this tape.  I can do this in the morning before work, and I feel energized and ready to go for the day.  I really like all of the Rodney Yee tapes I have tried, and highly recommend this one.",1043366400,6,415,4.227848101265823
1236329,1,B00000JPRS,"Forget this one folks, you would have to be a contortionist to even begin. I've done the Yoga Zone meditation tapes, and really enjoy those, but this one even says in the beginning you will work up a sweat etc.. I can tell you this: You don't sweat because there is no exercise. It is a matter of forming your body into impossible pretzel shapes. I really think you have to be more than a beginner to do this stuff. And it seems unnatural and actually dangerous. I tried it several times, careful each time to follow the instructions to the letter, and finally decided it was a definite no for me. I am in good shape normally, so it isn't a matter of being primed for it, it's a matter of being able to contort yourself like a rubber band.",1038268800,2,739,4.24822695035461
1236330,2,B00000JPRS,"Thankfully I had taken a yoga class led by an instructor prior to using this tape. During some of the 'salutation' poses, the pace is too fast for a beginner. Also, Rodney does this movement when he is transitioning from a standing postion to a face-down position on the ground where he puts all of his weight on his hands, lifts his legs off the ground, then extends them out in a push-up like position. Definately not a beginner stance. I think this tape would make most beginners frustrated. I would suggest only doing every-other pose/position during the fast pace movements, and then just modifying his movements as needed.",1020816000,9,628,4.770642201834862
1236331,5,B00000JPRS,"This is the third in the Power Yoga series.  I bought this video for more variety to go with the first two videos, Power Yoga for Stamina (vol 1), and Strength (vol 2).
After practicing this video I would have to say that it's the least physically intense of the three videos, but your flexibility will be tested the most.  You'll do upward facing dog poses with one leg lifted up to your stomach to put more weight on your other foot.  You'll also lift that leg up in the air behind you to stretch your muscles in ways you've never imagined!! The video ends with a lengthy cooldown session.
For a more intense workout in order of difficulty, try either the ""Stamina"" or the ""Strength"" videos as well.  You could even practice all three videos in series!
If you're new to yoga, I'd try the AM/PM yoga series first and then try the Power Yoga for Stamina or this video once you feel confortable with the basic poses.  These Power Yoga series videos are more intense and require more advanced flexibility and upper body strength.  Overall, I enjoyed this video tremendously and highly recommended for those Power Yoga enthusiasts!! (along with the other two videos)",1014940800,33,1163,4.621359223300971
1236332,1,B00000JPRS,"Originally Rodney Yee made one Power Yoga video.  Due to the success of that video they changed the packaging and labeled it the Stamina Version and added a Strength and this Flexibility version.
The problem with this tape is he tried to stick all the flexibility in without warming up the beginner.  As you'll learn about Power Yoga (a.k.a. Vinyasa, Flow, or Ashtanga) you will find out that repeated Sun Salutations are required before you are warmed up enough to enter into deeper poses.
On the other hand, the original tape - the Stamina version tape, is a great 20-minute tape.  If you like short tapes, Stamina is unbeatable.  If what you want is Flexibility then you need to get one of the Total Yoga Flow Series tapes. They are safe complete tapes, but they do take 45 minutes.
Whatever you do, be smart when you practice without a teacher. Don't push it too far until you know your yoga and your body.",1012780800,24,910,4.564417177914111
1236333,2,B00000JPRS,"I ordered Power Yoga for Strength along with this video and felt ripped off as the routines weren't that different ... i wanted something that was focused on flexibilty and this wasn't it.
Also this was shot in Joshua Tree National Park which was very distracting as Mr. Yee was doing his thing in a sea of tumbleweeds and Joshua Trees",1005004800,,335,4.508196721311475
1236334,4,B00000JPRS,"I agree that this isn't necessarily for beginners but the tape will continue to challenge you for a while and it will make stretching a good addictive habit.  Plus, why would you want to by something that you can master so easily.  But from personal experience, it has increased my flexibility and reduced my stress levels tremendously.  My balance has also improved since I don't find myself falling over anymore.  Just do what you can and you will slowly feel the difference within a couple of weeks.  Other positive things I've noticed is that it also helps to correct my bad posture and relieve some minor lower back pain too.  It's also perfect if you don't have a full hour to concentrate on yoga since it's only 25 minutes long.",994291200,,735,4.615384615384615
1236335,5,B00000JPRS,"This is a great tape if you are somewhat flexible already and want to prepare yourself for the more challenging poses. Make sure you have done some beginners workouts so you know some of the poses already. This definitely should not be you're first workout tape. This is a well paced workout that not only works on you're flexability but your'e strength and concentration too. This has alot of downward facing dog poses in it. This seemed to help prepare me for the headstands and handstands in the Yoga Journal's Yoga for intermediates by getting me used to having my head down and blood flowing to it. Rodney Yee is a great instructor. I love how he incorporates small meditations at the end of each of his videos. I am glad I purchased this tape. It brings me 20 min. of peace and serenity  and leaves me feeling focused, energised and peaceful throughout the day.",993859200,112,867,4.593548387096774
7913110,5,B00000JPRS,Good video.,1398729600,,11,5.0
7913111,5,B00000JPRS,"Bought it because I have tight muscles.  I like the tape, can do yoga on my schedule, not when someone else wants me to do it.  Great tape.",1385942400,,139,3.9285714285714284
7913112,5,B00000JPRS,"I love how Rodney Yee has a calm look, the scenery is gorgeous, the music is very soothing, as he takes you into postures and stretches. he is so easy to follow along. I can understand completely what the narrator is saying.
They offer props ideas, alternative postures or stretches to help you do your best.
I always feel refreshed, and full of energy upon finishing his videos and dvds.",1369008000,,388,4.557142857142857
7913113,5,B00000JPRS,"This is so good, hang onto the VCR just for Rodney's Power Yoga VHS.  Have the nearly same DVD versions for travel.",1322697600,,115,4.2272727272727275
7913114,2,B00000JPRS,"As a beginner to yoga, I was very surprised to see the fast pace of this workout.  You barely get into position before Rodney jumps (literally) to a different one.  He does not explain or talk you through most of this workout.  It is very repetitious with lots and lots of upward and downward dogs and forward bends.  I was disappointed with this video, as compared to Yoga for Athletes which sounds very, very daunting but has three levels of demonstration and Rodney slowly moves through the sessions and explains everything thoroughly.  If this Power Yoga were the first one I had done, I would not have bought another.",1093651200,3,622,4.669724770642202
7913115,4,B00000JPRS,"First of all, like all of the videos in the Living Arts ""for Beginners"" series, this tape assumes some prior familiarity with basic yoga poses, so ""Yoga Practice for Beginners"" is recommended as a first step.  Secondly, because this is a ""power"" yoga workout, it moves along at a fairly quick pace, so some baseline staminia and strength is also a necessary prerequisite to this practice.
That being said, Rodney Yee has done a nice job of putting together a flowing, energizing 25-minute workout on this video.  I particularly like how he gradually increases the difficulty level over the course of the practice.  For example, when you first begin the sun salutations, you will step back to a lunge and put your knees on the floor before coming into cobra; on subsequent repetitions, you jump back instead and then move into a low push-up position before doing a full upward dog.  Yee gradually adds on to the sun salutations with powerful pose, warrior poses, triangle, three-legged dog, and one of my favorite poses, pigeon--this is an especially nice hip opener.  Following the standing poses, Yee comes to a seated position for simple seated forward bends:  head to knee, wide-legged forward bend, and cobbler.  Finally, Yee moves to reclined poses and offers a nice guided meditation in relaxation pose which is less rushed than in his other videos.
This is my favorite video in Yee's Power Yoga series.  The practice flows at a nice, steady pace without feeling rushed, and the poses included provide excellent stretches, particularly for the hip area.  This is a good video for anyone who wants a shorter yoga practice which is invigorating without being exhausting.",1079654400,6,1674,4.971326164874552
7913116,5,B00000JPRS,"One word of caution...beginner.  It really is best if you get the series (strength or stamina) and become really good at one of those first.  This one is a little challenging if you are not in good shape already or if you unfamiliar with yoga poses.
Otherwise, the tape is a solid workout and not too long.  Before this workout I had a relatively weak upper body, but this has made me much stronger.  I can now do several pushups, impossible five weeks ago.
I have done tapes by three different people and I find Rodney Yee the best at explaining.
It's true that he goes pretty quickly.  MAny people who do yoga want a slow pace and more meditation.  If that's you then this tape is not for you.  But is you want to get stronger, more flexible and work up a ligh sweat, then this is the perfect tape.",1076198400,7,800,4.258278145695364
7913117,4,B00000JPRS,"I am tall and I live in Japan, which is designed for small people. Lower back aches and pains are constant for me. I have several of Rodney Yee's Power Yoga videos, but this is the best one to help ease the lower back. If bending forward causes pain or discomfort (other than the stretch of muscles I wouldn't recommend this tape as it will probably only give you more pain! However, if you have a job with a lot of sitting or standing involved and you need a good stretch to relieve the tension - this is the tape!
I agree with the comments that this is not a tape for beginners - but then most of the ""beginner"" series aren't really for beginners anyway. I had never done yoga before using Rodney Yee's ""beginner"" tapes. If you have good body awareness and start slowly you should be able to get the hang of the tape after 3-5 times.",1074038400,3,835,4.225
7913118,1,B00000JPRS,"Ill sum this up quick.  This video was horrible.  I like alot of Yees stuff, but this was a bad attempt to keep up with yoga trends. Pace was way too fast and the postures were hardly explained. Save the 9 bucks and put it twords Baptistes or Kests videos.",1059004800,6,256,4.1
7913119,3,B00000JPRS,"I bought this tape with the intention of using it to round out my fitness regimen of aerobics, weight training and flexibility exercise. I knew a few poses that I used for stretching after workouts, but wanted to practice yoga a little more formally. In general, this is a good tape. The length is perfect for an end-of-workout stretch. However, as a reasonably fit person who has done weight training for a few years and has considerable upper-body strength, I find it difficult to hold some of the positions as long as Mr. Yee does. For example, there is a great deal of emphasis on the ""downward dog"", which is fine, but he has you bear all your weight in your arms while you stretch your legs behind you for too long a period. Even the ""freakishly strong"" can't hold themselves up this long.  So for this reason, and for the fact that none of the poses are explained, I would have to agree with the common complaint that this tape is not for beginners. However, I would recommend it as a good after-workout stretch.",1049760000,5,1019,4.508108108108108
