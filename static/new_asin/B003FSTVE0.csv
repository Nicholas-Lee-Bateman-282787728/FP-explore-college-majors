4119180,5,B003FSTVE0,We learned so much from this informative documentary. Incredible underwater footage. Would highly recommend this one as well as Star Gardens.,1379548800,,141,5.761904761904762
4119181,5,B003FSTVE0,I love any video that has to do with underwater and coral reefs. The Ocean Realm series is always high-quality and a joy to watch. I have watched videos that were supposed to be about the coral reefs and much of the video was about the crew and long minutes of them on the boat (time and time again) and their equiptment and on and on...this has none of that. It's about the underwater realm. Beautiful.,1362268800,,403,4.315789473684211
4119182,4,B003FSTVE0,"This is a great standard video if you are curious to learn what kelp in and about how underwater kelp interacts with surrounding sea life.  Lots of different sea creatures are shown.  Great educational tool.  Reminds me of the movies that were shown to me by my elementary school teacher way back when, and got me more knowledgeable/curious about the ocean and interested in a career that is environmentally/nature-related.",1281484800,2,423,5.101449275362318

8396149,5,B003FSTVE0,"These are great. I put this on for my almost 2 yr old son and he sat and watched for a long while. Love to put something on tv that I can learn from and isn't complete garbage. Really liked this, looking at the other series now as well.",1425513600,,236,3.836734693877551
8396150,5,B003FSTVE0,"Admittedly, the footage is from several decades ago, and grainy and faded compared to today's standards. But if you look past that, there is some really amazing stuff in there, and the narration really brings the kelp forests to life in a way few nature documentaries manage.",1418860800,,275,4.872340425531915
