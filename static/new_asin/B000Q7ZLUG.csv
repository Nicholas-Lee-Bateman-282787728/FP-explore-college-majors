2834831,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"Exquisite times, beautiful acting, and wondrous story lines ~ How could you possibly get better than two of the most brilliant actors William Powell and Myrna Loy ~ I was a bit surprised it didn't include Liabled Lady with Spence and Jean, but that's okay, I actually already have that movie ~ Without a doubt a treasure, one I never wish to part with ~",1188432000,3,353,4.446153846153846
2834832,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"This is a beautifully presented box set of Powell & Loy which gives you
an insight to films they made together other than the ""Thin Man"" series
the clarity of the discs and the sound quality surprised me considering
the films age.
As for the actors I would buy a film of Powell and Loy shopping in
Wal-Mart i'm that easily pleased, but if you want to see the golden age
of Hollywood and a mixture of drama and screwball comedy at its best
then look no further",1188432000,5,459,4.2272727272727275
2834833,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"After a considerable wait, the remaining five movies which starred Powell and Loy is available on DVD and it is really great to be able to enjoy their efforts.  Powell and Loy were stars of the very successful ""Thin Man"" series (the title character was actually the murder victim in the first series, but most of the fans thought it referred to Nick Charles).  Along with the six movies in the Thin Man series, the pair made seven other movies (not counting the Powell vehicle ""The Senator was Indiscrete"" in which Loy makes a cameo appearance) leading many to believe that they were in fact married in real life.

The movies in this series run the gamut from the sorts of melodramas that MGM famously churned out in the 30s.  To be honest, I prefer the later comedies. Clearly, after the success of the first of the Thin Man movies, producers understood that the pair was very well suited to light comedy and animated banter.  In films like ""Love Crazy,"" ""I Love You Again"" and ""Double Wedding,"" Powell and Loy perform well in romantic comedy roles.  Loy's personna as ""the perfect wife"" and her own skills at light comedy make her a perfect foil for Powell's wisecrakes and prat falls.  My favorite of this series is ""I Love You Again"" in which Powell plays a gangster who due amnesia has spent ten years as a squirral stuffing club joining guardian of civic virtue much to Loy's dismay.  In ""Double Wedding"" and ""Love Crazy,"" Powell gets to stretch his comedic range. Loy is of course perfect.

The two non-comedies are interesting as well. ""Manhatten Melodrama"" was a massive hit in its day and looks more like the sort of films that Warner Brothers became famous for in which childhood friends follow different paths and Loy is the romantic interest. It is the pair's only teaming with Gable (although Loy made several really good films with ""the King""). ""Evelyn Prentis"" appears to have been billed as a romantic comedy, given the trailer (included in all the movies). It is the story of a marriage on the rocks due to the husband's career and his refusal to spend more time at home. Rosalind Russell is one of the clients in the film in an early role.

This is a wonderful series and even includes some cartoons and short subjects.  Powell and Loy's other movies include ""Libeled Lady"" (with Jean Harlow (who was slated to marry Powell), and ""The Great Zigfeld"" along with the boxed set of Thin Man movies are all available on DVD.",1186617600,50,2438,4.633410672853828
2834834,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"This is movie making like, well, like they don't make any more. Great acting, great chemistry, totally fun. Throw away the modern movies geared to 12 year olds and buy this for the sheer pleasure of watching two of the most wonderful performers ever to grace our movie screens.

2834835,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"No one does it better than William Powell and Myrna Loy.  Their timing and chemistry are superb.  This is another great collection of films that will meet or exceed the quality of one's classic film library.

Powell and Loy are unequalled whether they are in a comedy or a drama.  If you love fine films, add this to your collection.  And put it next to your ""Thin Man"" collection.

There are very few classic film duos from the golden age of motion pictures and William Powell and Myrna Loy are at the top of that list.  A huge thanks to Warner Home Video for releasing these great films on DVD.",1184457600,4,596,4.363636363636363
2834836,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"When it comes to screen chemistry between two stars, there were probably only four that stood the test of time...Fred & Ginger, Flynn & de Havilland, Tracy & Hepburn, and my personal (non-musical) favorites, the unbeatable combination of WILLIAM POWELL and MYRNA LOY.

A million thank-you's to those amazing folks at Warner Brothers who keep managing to find a way to drain my bank balance...and I couldn't be happier. Every set from Warner is a winner, but this one is particularly appealing, because I've practically worn out my 6 Thin Man discs!

Here we get a broader spectrum of this terrific twosome. Their screwball shenanigans take center stage in laugh-filled romps such as DOUBLE WEDDING, I LOVE YOU AGAIN, and LOVE CRAZY. All hysterical. All worth countless viewings. Equally compelling are the more serious films in this set, the box-office smash MANHATTAN MELODRAMA, where CLARK GABLE shares the screen with Loy and Powell, and the highly underrated EVELYN PRENTICE which is a great showcase for both Ms. Loy and Mr. Powell. All five films will be joined by extra features, as is always the Warner way.

If you only know these two as NICK & NORA, you're in for even more fun...
and you might as well pick up the already-available LIBELED LADY, which is truly one of the greatest comedies of all time.

Thank you Warner Home Video for honoring this terrific twosome so wonderfully!",1184371200,71,1393,4.889830508474576
2834837,3,B000Q7ZLUG,"Powell and Loy are at their best in the last two films. I personally much prefer Love Crazy to I Love You Again, which is slightly skewered and in some ways unpleasant - Powell's earlier years playing villans gives a bit too much authenticity to his characterization of a cad. One is left the ugly suspicion that a hidden side of his character is fundamentally quite detestable. Too, I Love You Again calls up a little too much of the drab small town dinginess (and sets to match) infiltrating and to my taste weakening the glamour of scenes in the later Thin Man series. Loy made some fine realistic movies, but Powell and Loy together are NOT small town!

  Love Crazy finds the urban-dweller Powell waltzing into the movie, happily in love, ironically whistling the playful ditty ""It's Delightful to be Married"" a previous screen love, Louise Rainer, sang for him as Flo Ziegfeld's Fanny Held. (Who Powell playing Ziegfeld divorces for - Myrna Loy as Billie Burke.) The knowing and biting comments on marriage from the cabbie and the doorman regarding Powell's martial bliss set the undercurrents in play for the giddy Powell's undoing as the cheerful husband - ignorant of the games the mischievous Fates (The Gods of Comedy) have in store for him ahead. Into the apartment complex he jauntily carries his wedding present - a portable phonograph, and almost immediately his evening begins to unravel. I Love You Again is at all times genuinely loveable, and works it's sleight of hand with the practiced aplomb we expect from such talents. The moment when Powell suggests he and his wife, Loy, recreate their honeymoon night, but do everything 'backwards' is as priceless as is Loy's cooling rebutal to his attempt at jumping the gun on the bedroom. Too, the underrated Gail Patrick (see her sensational working with Powell in My Man Godfrey) and the lively and fun Jack Carson are most effective in their set-up roles. The best scene: a Lincoln-like Powell, pretending insanity to prevent a divorce proceeding, sets top hats sailing on a swimming pool, ""Be free!""

  The other three films are for me at least largely forgettable.

  If I Love You Again and Love Crazy were paired I would rate them at least a 4, possibly a 4 and half. But the rating plummets when they're connected to the others.

  When will we be able to see some Powell movies without Loy? Life With Father demands release restored to its glorious colors, not to mention Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid. A set of the best of Powell's Warner Brothers films?

  If, unlike myself, you loved all these films and don't yet own Libeled Lady then by all means order that film ASAP! The DVD print is not quite as good as it should be, but the movie is wonderful, with Powell's real life girl friend (and what a twist that gives the film!) Jean Harlow just sensational fun!",1181952000,18,2836,4.712550607287449
2834838,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"This collection contains five titles currently not on DVD that were made starring the famous duo during the same time frame as their ""Thin Man"" series. With the exception of 1947's ""The Senator was Indiscreet"", this puts all of the Loy/Powell films on DVD. The extras described below are from a press release from Warner Home Video. The biggest let-down about this set is the lack of commentary for any of the films, but Warner probably figures with the amount of documentary material they put in the Thin Man Boxed Set, they would just be going over old territory. The films, in chronological order, are as follows:

Manhattan Melodrama (1934)
This is more of a movie with Powell and Loy than one about them as a couple. The focus is more on Clark Gable and William Powell, who play two orphans who grow up together but wind up on opposite sides of the law. Myrna Loy plays the woman that both characters love. Gable plays the gangster in this film, Powell the guy who goes up the political ladder. The melodramatic part is that as D.A. Powell's character wins a conviction against Gable's character, and as a result he is sentenced to death. Later, as governor, Powell must decide whether or not to commute his childhood friend's sentence. Powell is very good here at playing a more serious role.
Special Features:
 Comedy short ""Goofy Movies #2""
 Classic cartoon ""The Old Pioneer""
 Theatrical trailer
 Subtitles: English & French (feature film only)

Evelyn Prentice (1934)
This one seems to miss a step as far as plot holes go, but it is still above average. Powell plays a defense attorney who is also part detective, and whose heavy-duty work habits cause him to neglect his wife, played by Loy in the title role. As a result of this neglect, Loy commits an indiscretion with a playboy and ultimately figures into her husband's next big murder case.
Special Features:
 Comedy short ""Goofy Movies #3""
 Classic cartoon ""Discontented Canary""
 Theatrical trailer
 Subtitles: English & French (feature film only)

Double Wedding (1937)
This is a different kind of film for Powell and Loy. Loy plays high-powered businesswoman Margit Agnew who is unhappy to learn that her little sister is planning to marry vagabond Charlie Lodge (William Powell) who, since he lives in a trailer, is hardly in a position to support her. Margit tries to intervene, and in the end winds up with Lodge herself. The plot is thin, but the comedy is very good. This film was shot partly before and after the death of Jean Harlow, who was Powell's lover and Loy's good friend. Filming was suspended for awhile due to the tragedy.
Special Features:
 Musical short ""Dancing on the Ceiling""
 Classic cartoon ""The Hound and the Rabbit""
 Theatrical trailer
 Subtitles: English & French (feature film only)

I Love You Again (1940)
My favorite non-Thin Man Loy and Powell movie and showcases everything that is great about the chemistry the two had on screen. Powell plays stuffy and rich Larry Wilson, who, after a blow to the head, realizes he is actually confidence man George Carey. Wilson is just some alternate identity he assumed after he first got amnesia nine years before. Realizing he has a sweet deal in his wealthy second identity, Carey decides to clean out Wilson's finances and leave town. However, when Carey meets Wilson's estranged wife, played by Loy, he falls for her and decides to hang around long enough to win her back.
Special Features:
 Crime Doesn't Pay Series short ""Jackpot""
 Classic cartoon ""Tom Turkey and His Harmonica Humdingers""
 Theatrical trailer
 Subtitles: English & French (feature film only)

Love Crazy (1941)
Another excellent entry in the Loy and Powell series of movies. After four years of marriage, Stephen Ireland (William Powell) runs into an old girlfriend that lives nearby. The two end up just talking, but a series of comic misadventures cause Stephen's wife, Susan (Myrna Loy), to believe Stephen is cheating on her and she decides to divorce Stephen. Desperate to keep Susan, Stephen decides to pretend he is not in his right mind to draw things out. He does such a good job that everyone believes him - except his wife. There is some great physical comedy here by Powell.

2834887,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"Absolutely  one of the best Collection put together of Myrna Loy and William Powell. it has it all ! Drama with Manhattan Melodrama, there first pairing, where he play a lawyer making his way up while his street wise friend (Gable) goes the opposite way. and the common thing they have is the love for each other and Loy. Evelyn Prentice is another drama though not as impacting as Manhattan Melodrama it's still good Powell once again plays a lawyer who neglects his wife Loy. Rosalind Russell also star. Then Comes the lighter side of Powell and Loy, with Double Wedding which is so funny as Powell plays a bohemian who gets under Loy's skin and falls in love with her and tries to get her to admit the same. After that is I Love You Again- Powell is an uptight man on a cruise till an accident causes him to loose his memory and remember himself and fall for Loy all over again. Love Crazy, out of all of these films this is the one that will make you laugh the hardest. Powell and Loy are happily married till a miss understanding in the form of an old flame( Gail Patrick) comes back then in order to win her back Powell he pretends to be insane but things start snowball.",1436313600,5,1177,4.32579185520362

2834929,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"I cannot offer a normal critical review. I've been a fan of both actors since I first watched the Thin Man series, so all I can say is that my positive expectations were rewarded. There really is a kind of dynamic between them that the camera can capture but not control or impose.

When I wrote the first version of this review (6mar14), I had only watched each movie once; I hadn't noticed many details. For example, I didn't notice any bloopers or goofs. This website, however, remarks on such things: IMDb. I plan to read up next time before watching. [Note: When I first posted this, I put in the link to the other website, but I see that it was removed--even though Amazon owns IMDb. Now I've just written the initials. 9mar2014]

For people like me who were expecting the humor of the Thin Man series, it's important to note that two of the films are not comedies: ""Manhattan Melodrama"" (MM) and ""Evelyn Prentice."" The first of these was also the first time for them to act together, according to the slipcover. Both of these films let us see Powell & Loy outside their more familiar comedy roles.

I just re-watched MM and looked more carefully at what is going on. I like these two performers even more, now.

By the time MM movie was made, the word 'melodrama' already had a slightly negative connotation of being an over simplification of life: A completely pure Dudley Do-Right opposes a completely evil Snidely Whiplash. A woman is thrown in, so to speak, as a 'romantic interest'; she, too, must be as pure as the hero. In this movie, we get a similar set up, at least on the surface. Consider the name of Clark Gable & Mickey Roonie's tough-guy character, Blackie. Consider the name of the seemingly dull-witted boy Blackie outwits: Spud. Yet later Blackie hires Spud (played by Nat Pendleton) as his right-hand man.

I mention these points because all through the film there are instances of black/white moral oppositions with a third or fourth person in ""gray,"" who sometimes moves to one or the other color. It seems as if the makers of the film are saying that in life there are in fact opposites as well as those in the middle. Yet, they also seem to be saying that what we think is 'good' sometimes is not so good after all, as when Powell's character Jim Wade must make decisions about Blackie, who runs illegal gambling joints. In short, it occurs to me that the makers of the film--writers, director, producer--might have purposely used the somewhat despised vaudeville title of 'melodrama' to highlight people's core character.

This takes me to Myrna Loy, who plays Eleanor, Blackie's girlfriend, who tires of his gangster lifestyle. As we discover early on, Eleanor is not a pure heroine in the old school variety but a modern hero(ine): a person who reflects on life and makes some tough decisions about what it means to live a good life. Throughout the movie she serves as a foil to both male leads. [I'm trying not to give the film away.]

The next film, ""Evelyn Prentice,"" is also serious drama with black-and-white characters as well as those who move in the gray. As in MM, Powell plays a famous attorney, but Loy, his wife, is the central figure. Loy's character recalls Desdemona in some respects, a credit to the writing as much as the acting.

As for the three comedies, they're fun. The slipcover comment about ""I Love You Again"" says that, after a hit to the head, boring husband (Powell) becomes ""convince[d]"" he's a ""con man."" Watching the film a second time, I'm convinced he may have originally been a con man!

At some point it might be worthwhile to compare the way certain screen couples work against the times in which they live--and the way Hollywood thought they should be shown. Powell & Loy in the 30s vs say Hanks & Ryan in the 90s. (Somebody has probably done this already, and I'm just not aware of it.)

Finally, the more I see work by director W.S. Van Dyke, the more I like it.

2834939,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"Have you heard of Nick and Nora Charles, the detectives, and their adorable little terrier, Asta?  These are the two stars who created those characters, but in different movies. Since they are typical of the 1930s, they feature elegant costumes (men in tuxedos, women in long satin evening gowns with elbow-length gloves), beautiful Art Deco settings, and witty script writing, usually in the style that was known as ""snappy patter."" Both Myrna Loy and William Powell have a lot of screen chemistry, and are quite believable as lovers or spouses. There are five discs, one movie on each: ""Manhattan Melodrama (directed by David O. Selznick of ""Gone With the Wind"" fame), ""Evelyn Prentice"", ""Double Wedding"", ""I Love You Again,"" and ""Love Crazy."" The extras on each disc represent vintage cartoons like ""Tom Turkey and His Harmonica Humdingers"" or ""The Hound and the Rabbit""; comedy shorts, a musical short, and even an audio-only radio show with William Powell.  This would make a wonderful gift for someone who lived through the 1930s and 1940s, or for someone who is new to the team of Loy and Powell.  I purchased this along with the large Nick and Nora Charles ""The Thin Man"" set that was also offered.

I purchased that set (on Amazon) and enjoy them during my movie marathons.  One day while I was watching the TCM channel I saw ""I Love You Again""  was coming on, saw who was in it and knew I wouldn't be disappointed.

There is nothing like the classic movies for clean, well rounded acting, suspense, drama and comedy all rolled into a wonderful movie that your kids could watch.  Unlike today where there a cuss words (mind you I'm not a prude in anyway), nudity, sex and computers to do what the old ""Masters"" didn't need to do and even got better results.

1. Manhattan Melodrama- With Clark Gable as a childhood friend of Powell who is a criminal now. This is the movie John Dillinger saw shortly before he was gunned down. 4.5 Stars
2. Evelyn Prentice- A drama and the least of their efforts on this set. Still anything with Powell and Loy is worth watching- 3.5 Stars
3. Double Wedding- Fine Comedy with Powell as a beatnik artist and a Loy as a conservative businesswoman. Powell is slated to marry Loy's sister but we know that isn't going to happen.- 5 Stars
4. I Love You Again- GREAT comedy with Powell as a former con man with amnesia and Loy as his unhappy wife. Funny and clever and one of the alltime best screwball comedies. 5 Stars is an understatement.
5. Love Crazy- Another fine comedy with Powell being a little more silly and less sophisticated than usual. 4.5 Stars.

This is the second set teaming her with William Powell (the first being the awesome Thin Man collection). This is a great set of films that Warner Brothers did a fantastic job on cleaning these prints. They are so clean and clear, its hard to believe these were made in the '30s. Warner has always done wonder with these older films. And this collection is no exception. Just glad to see these classics look so good! This really makes Mr hungry for more of Myrna Loy's work from Warner Brothers vault get a great make over like these great little movies.
Would love to see Penthouse, Prize fighter and the Lady and others put together for a Myrna Loy collection.
But unfortunately they just get the DVD-R treatment. Myrna Loy deserves her own collection because she is truly the one actress from the '30s and '40s that really looked great on the silver screen.

2834984,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"I had previously bought The Thin Man collection before buying this, which was excellent!! I bought the Myrna Loy and William Powell Collection in the hopes it would be just as wonderful, and it is!! The first movie, Evelyn Prentice is half murder mystery, half court room drama. Evelyn is shamefully neglected by her ambitious husband. Feeling lonely she agrees to have tea with a different gentlemen, although this is as far as the relationship goes, the young man begins to blackmail Evelyn. When a corpse turns up it puts Evelyn and her unaware attorney husband in a tough spot. Manhattan Melodrama is just that, a melodrama. It tells the tale of two boyhood friends that were orphaned together and raised through hardship together. One boy turns out very well (William Powell) being honest and successful and scholarly. The other boy's (Clark Gable) life goes awry. he prefers pool halls and gambling and dishonesty to school and his studies. Although both remain loyal lifelong friends, Myrna Loy drives a wedge between the two which is driven deeper when William Powell must decide whether to help his outlaw pal or choose his honesty. I Love You, Again is a hilarious comedy about stoic Larry Wilson (William Powell) who is hit on the head and suddenly remembers that he has had a lapse of memory for the past 9 years and is actually George Carey, the gangster. Soon discovering that during his state of amnesia he had married beautiful Kay (Myrna Loy). Larry/George gets all geared up for some romance only to discover that his wife is filing for divorce. Also he is setting up a big scam for the people of Habersville. Between trying to win back his wife's affection and manage in a town where he is well known yet knows nothing himself puts him in many hilarious scrapes. Double Wedding is also a comedy. Margit (Myrna Loy)is a controlling woman who decides her sister's and her sister's fiancee's every move. When the sister decides not to marry her fiancee, Charles (William Powell) decides to help her ex-fiancee win her back, in the process falling in love with Margit. Now Powell must find a way to loosen the formidable Loy up enough to be able to accept his love. Love Crazy is by far the best film in the entire collection. Steve and Susan Ireland are all set for a romantic anniversary only to be interrupted by Susan's meddling mother. Mother sends Steve off to mail a policy and when he runs into old flame Isobel Grayson, his mother-in-law blows the situation out of proportion to Susan. Susan then calls Mr. Grayson,Isobel's husband, and asks him if they can give their spouses a ""taste of their own medicine"" by kissing when they come home. Much confusion ensues when Susan, never having met Mr. Grayson, goes to the wrong man's apartment. After a confusing and troubling night Susan leaves Steve. The night before Susan and Steve are to go before the judge for their divorce, Steve's lawyer comes up with a scheme that if Steve pretends to be insane, that Susan cannot divorce him for at least five years (which was the law of that day and age). After many hysterical antics Steve convinces the court and the public that he is insane. Susan, who is not fooled a bit, retaliates by having him committed to an institution. Steve is now caught in his own trap but has no way out. I won't spoil the ending for y'all! Anyway this is a wonderful collection of classic movies. All fans of ""The Thin Man"" won't be disappointed by this collection!

Manhattan Melodrama (my personal favorite of the five)  is the very first time Powell and  Loy were paired together and the chemistry between them in their first meeting in the cab is so obvious it's no wonder why they made 14 movies together.  Evelyn Prentice is the other drama in the collection and the courtroom scene at the end is very tense and well done.  The three comedies, Double Wedding, Love Crazy and I Love You again are laugh out loud great, I Love You Again is my 15 year old daughter's favorite.

Mother was an MGM starlet in 1934. I had not been able to find a copy of this short after it was seen in part on TCM. I wrote TCM and searched the IMDB to no avail.
And then this collection appeared! It fills the bill and is probably also appreciated by William Powell and Myrna Loy fans as well.
Mother stars in the short musical film ""Dancing on the Ceiling."" She plays the dentist. What is significant about this film is that it may have been the precursor to the ceiling dancing film done by Fred Astiare.
This short is not associated with the Lionel Richie, Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald works of the same name done more recently.

2835003,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"These 5 movies, outside of the ""Thin Man"" series are among the very best the Loy/Powell team did.  The first two ""Manhatten Melodrama"" and ""Evelyn Prentice"" are dramas.  The later of the two, I feel, was the best. ""Evenlyn Prentice"" is of a neglected attorney's wife (Loy) who although loves her husband (Powell) faithfully is slyly targeted by a blackmailer.  The blackmailer succeeds in getting letters written by Loy that could be misconstured.  Because of her husbands position she goes to retrieve them.  Drunk he withholds them.  Seeing a gun she holds it on him.  He's shot and Loy flees with the letters, not knowing the outcome until reading the man's girlfriend has been arrested for the murder.  Loy can't keep silent believeing she herself killed the man.  She begs Powell to defend the girl and when the trial goes badly she stands up and confesses.  The outcome is surprising and I will leave that part for the audience to learn. Being a comedy fan I prefer the 3 remaining movies.  In ""Double Wedding"" Powell plays a free spirit living in a small trailer,  Loy feels Powell is threatening the future of younger sister (Florence Rice) who has become enamered with Powell.  Loy is determined to get rid of Powell, while he sets out to win Loy over by subtly involving her in his activities, with much humor and fun ensueing.  ""I Love You Again"" portrays Powell as a tight fisted ""joiner"" on a cruise.  After falling overboard he awakens to find he remembers nothing of his former life, which he had assumed after an earlier hit on the head.  He now becomes the man he was originally, a con artist and extravagant spender, suave dresser, dancer, charmer...attributes his wife, whom he soon meets at the dock, Loy, has never seen.  She hates the image in the man she married and has plans to divorce him.  Powell has to fake being her husband and the town's leading citizen in order to bilch the local citizens of their money.  To his surprise he likes the life he's leading and falls, of course, for Loy.  ""Love Crazy"" is of a couple madly in love intent on celebrating their anniversary in a bazaar tradition, which goes all wrong prompted by the unannounced arrival of Loy's mother and Powell's becoming involved with a former girlfriend in an elevator jam.  After many mishaps Loy finally determines Powell has wronged her and files for divorce.  Desparate, Powell fakes lunicy in order to prevent the divorce from going through.  His antics are hilarious as he breaks out of the assylum and dresses up as his own ""sister"".  Jack Carson plays the sympathetic man to Loy and runs interference with Powell's plan to win his wife back.  I know anyone who enjoys William Powell and Myrna Loy will love this collection.

2835013,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"A great set. Few people know that Manhattan Melodrama was the film that the infamous gangster John Dillinger saw just before he was gunned down by FBI agent C.B. Winstead outside the Biograph Theater on Chicago's Lincoln Avenue on July 22, 1934. Dillinger was in the company of two women, one of whom is believed to have set him up. Dillinger was shot three times with a Colt .45 automatic: one shot through the lung and out the chest, one shot through the head and out below the right eye, and the third round grazing his face. He died within minutes. An unfired Colt .380 automatic was found in his pocket. One can only wonder what he thought about while watching Clark Gable in this great gangster film, perhaps wondering if his own life of crime was about to come to a sudden end.",1213401600,2,784,4.451388888888889
2835014,4,B000Q7ZLUG,"This set of William Powell/Myrna Loy films contains all of the MGM films, with the exception of ""The Great Ziegfield"" and ""Libeled Lady"", which they made together not featuring ""The Thin Man"" characters. While the dramas are OK, comedy was their forte. Powell usually played some sort of nutty character and Loy was the sane base around which the nuttiness revolved. The set is a showcase for Powell's versatility but their smooth rapport and warm charm is always a pleasure.

First off is ""Manhattan Melodrama"" a drama starring Clark Gable and the first film in which Powell and Loy appeared together. This is the oft repeated yarn about boyhood friends who take different paths in life. Gable is a gangster and Loy switches allegiance from him to lawyer Powell. It is interesting to watch how she reacts to the different acting styles of the 2 male stars; brittle with Gable and soft with the other. All of them are excellent. One very odd standout is the song in a nightclub, sung by white Shirley Ross, with a bad black wig and swarthy makeup, fronting a black band and singing ""The Bad in Every Man"" in torchy style, a song which evolved into ""Blue Moon"" - bizarre!  The film was directed by W S Van Dyke, who was the one who saw Powell and Loy's potential and teamed them in ""The Thin Man"", their next film. Van Dyke was known for the speed of his direction and this film has a pace which makes it more comparable to a Warner Brother's product than the usual overblown MGM product. Keep an eye out too for a very young and talented Mickey Rooney as Gable as a kid.

""Evelyn Prentice"" was the first film Powell and Loy made after the standout success of ""The Thin Man"". In this one, Powell is a lawyer who works too hard and neglects wife Loy. Adultery and murder result in an unusual courtroom drama with a twist but Loy underacts to the point of inertia. In terms of reality, the film suffers from the usual MGM gloss, overdressed stars and glamorous sets. Warner Brothers would have made this more dynamic and convincing.

In 1938, ""Double Wedding"" was farce whereby bohemian Powell melts officious Loy. The film is quite amusing due to the smooth performances of the stars but there are too many close-ups of supporting Florence Rice and John Beal, who obviously were getting a build up, one which neither subsequently warranted. Once again, the MGM house style with production line direction from Richard Thorpe makes this a pleasant way of passing 90 minutes but Powell and Loy are better than their material. By the way, Loy has some great close ups and looks terrific.

Released in 1940, ""I Love you Again"" is a quite amusing comedy showcasing Powell as an amnesia victim. Like most of these films, the comedy revolves around the scrapes which Powell gets into and he is very funny as an amnesia victim. Loy's role, as his wife, is much less interesting.  There is the usual good supporting cast but the film is overlong, once again with too many close-ups and that stolid feel from which many MGM films suffered.

The last film is ""Love Crazy"", a marital/divorce farce, the highlight of which is Powell in impeccable drag. This might be the funniest film of all. There is a great performance by Florence Bates as Loy's mother and other good supporting players such as Sig Rumann and Gail Patrick

All of the prints are unrestored and therefore variable but mostly good. ""Manhattan Melodrama"" notably looks pristine. The set contains original trailers, some mostly dumb MGM cartoons, some in faded colour, and a few MGM goofy movies, Pete Smith narrated scripts to an antique silent melodrama - very corny.  ""Double Wedding"" contains an unusual musical short with Busby Berkeley cuties set in an art deco dentist's office. This has to be seen to be believed.

The set is good value.",1211328000,6,3795,4.684684684684685

2835016,5,B000Q7ZLUG,"Sophistication and elegance mingled with martinis each time William Powell and Myrna Loy made a film together. Their pairing in the wonderful ""The Thin Man"" launched not only the finest series of enjoyable ""A"" class mysteries ever captured on camera, but a screen couple so wonderfully matched that their only rival was the greatest dance partners in the history of film, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.

After decades of neglect, five of the couple's films outside ""The Thin Man"" series have been released on this truly beautiful and long awaited collection. It was given the class it deserves, everything about it as delicate and elegant as fine crystal. It slides out and opens up in four panels, lovely pictures of Powell and Loy adorning the glossy design. Even the discs look terrific, with rare photos of the pair gracing the moviegoer when they are removed for viewing.

The collection itself is fabulous. ""Manhattan Melodrama"" uses the star power of Powell, Loy, and Clark Gable to overcome any shortcomings this crime drama might have. Though somewhat forgotten today, it is nice to have ""Evelyn Prentice"" included here. It is a warm and involving marital drama with a crime angle.

Loy is simply fabulous as a wife and mother who has the trappings of happiness but not the man with which to share it. Urged in the wrong direction by a friend, with blackmail and a murder the outcome, it sounds much more explosive than it really is. But it is more a mature marital drama with Powell showing his love for wife Evelyn in the courtroom, where there will be enough twists and turns to keep you on your toes.

The other three films could easily have been given their own collection as they seem to belong together. Each is a very funny comedy with much to recommend it. ""Double Wedding"" has Loy trying to stop Powell from marrying her sister, or her sister from marrying Powell. It is terribly funny and, of course, it's no surprise who really belongs together.

William Powell has never been funnier and Myrna Loy has never been more lovely than in W.S. Van Dyke's ""I Love You Again."" Powell is a hoot and Loy is more adorable than ever in this sharp comedy. Powell gets a knock on the head and remembers he's a less than stellar fellow. But for several years he's been living an uninspired life which he's sure involves some dough. But it also involves a babe of a wife who sort of likes this new husband. You can probably fill in the blanks but it's a lot of fun getting there in this one.

 In ""Love Crazy,"" marital bliss turns into hilarious chaos when Powell tries to have himself declared insane so wife Loy won't divorce him. The trouble is, it works! This is one of the great marital screwball comedies, with a great supporting cast. It's a merry mix-up, with Powell's stay at Doctor Wuthering's Rest Home a riot. Powell pretending to be his own sister and slapping around Jack Carson in a dress is not to be missed!

A wonderful gift I cherish and will enjoy for years to come, this is one of the best designed boxed sets on the market. Film buffs were incredibly happy to see these hard to find films finally given a classy release. If you love film, especially classic films of the 30's and 40's, you cannot find anything better out there than this beautiful set.",1208131200,3,3281,4.615780445969126

2835025,3,B000Q7ZLUG,"William Powell and Myrna Loy were paired together for eleven films: the six Thin Man movies (available in their own collection)and these five. They had good rapport, and people enjoyed them in a variety of settings. Admittedly, Myrna Loy frequently played 'straight man' to Powell's mischieviosity. In the commentary to the Thin Man series, it says that by the last film she was eager to do more serious 'topical' roles. And certainly her Nora doesn't get to play to her (Loy's) potential.

  In this group of five films, stories unrelated to each other, we frequently see her in a more serious character, whether in melodrama or comedy. The mobster's-moll-turned-reformer's-wife in ""Manhattan Melodrama"" is serious, but not one of her better performances. Or perhaps the intervening sixty-five plus years have changed sensibilities enough that it is hard for us today to consider 'melodrama' well done! While Loy may have wanted to take on serious issues, her performances shine in comedy. And she may have realized that 'issues' can be addressed through a palatable comedy without the heavy-handed approach of melodrama.

  Each disk also contains extras -- a bit different variety on each disk: a radio broadcast version of the film (of least interest to me), period cartoons, and shorts or 'public information' films. It is hard to tell from today's perspective if the short accompanying 'Manhattan Melodrama' on the evils and social degradation of slot machines is meant to be tongue in cheek humor or serious morality tale. I suspect the latter, but today it seems outrageous. Quite a contrast is the short 'Dancing on the Ceiling' in which a man follows a woman into a dentist's office, only to find the entire staff is made up of women who use laughing gas on their patients and engage in strange fantasies with them while under the influence.

  Of the five films represented ""I Love you Again"" is my favorite, though that may be due to greater familiarity. It is the only one I had found to purchase (on VHS) before this set was released. But it still seems to have a story line and banter that has the best timing and the fewest elements that take you out of the story to say 'boy, this was really made a long time ago!'.

  Not every film is magic. But it is a good thing to have this set available so that -- despite their mixed qualities -- we can still enjoy the Powell-Loy pairing.",1189036800,21,2397,4.79126213592233
