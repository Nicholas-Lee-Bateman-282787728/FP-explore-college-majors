8523793,2,B0080T44FA,"Does not stick at all to Bulgakov's novel, contrary to the screenwriters' claim. It mixes in plot elements from the novel with bits and pieces from other novels (notably ""Ya ubil"") and other elements that come from nowhere in Bulgakov, to produce a film that is ferociously both anti-Ukrainian and anti-Bolshevik, lacking Bulgakov's ironic treatment of the hugely complex issues of the time. I think Bulgakov would have hated it. Some of the acting is good - again, a mixed bag. My longer review will appear in SlavFile (quarterly journal of the American Translators Association) later this year.",1405468800,,596,5.091836734693878
