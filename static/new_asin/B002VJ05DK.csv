3996101,4,B002VJ05DK,MY KID LOVES DIEGO AND DORA. HE WATCHES THIS ALL DAY LONG OVER AND OVER. BUT ITS GREAT BECAUSE IT TEACHES THEM SOME BASIC SPANISH WHICH IS WONDERFUL. GO DIEGO GO,1287705600,,161,4.225806451612903
3996102,5,B002VJ05DK,"admittedly, he loves most of the Diego videos, but this is one of his favorites. He will actually site and watch it and participate with the interactive portions. It's good fun and educational. I like it because it will start without my having to wait to push the play button and the stories will play on after the other. I set the tv in his bedroom to play for an hour and never have to worry about the video ending before the timer turns the TV off.",1271289600,2,451,4.195402298850575
3996103,5,B002VJ05DK,"I bought this DVD because my son loves Diego. I bought this DVD without knowing what was on it, so here is a list of the specific episodes it has. I don't recall seeing many of these on tv, so they must be new episodes;

- Welcome home lion cub
- Diego's Ringed Seal Rescue
- Diego reunites hippopotamus & oxpecker
- Diego's orangutan rescue

Enjoy!",1266019200,22,349,4.2727272727272725

8382077,4,B002VJ05DK,"My toddler loves this DVD!  The lions, the seals, the hippo, and the orangutans are all interesting.  She especially likes the seals and the hippo (& his symbiotic bird friend:). The silly seal song amuses this mom as well.  Some of the questions are confusing to her because the seal and lion episodes have answers that would apply to each other.  But overall, I am very pleased with the DVD!
