1086255,5,6305869049,"This is when you know a singer has it all. This is not your R&B Chaka. This is Chaka in a smooth Jazz setting with a band that is tight and complements her. She gets right down to buisness after the bands runs off a piece by themselves, which is really  setting you up for Chaka's performance which is flawless. Not a lot of talking, she gets right down to Jazz music.
  REMEMBER, this is not R&B, this is her in a different setting and I was totally impressed. Check out her song ""Reconsider"" on this DVD and you will see what I mean. Patti has nothing on this woman. JAZZ LOVERS, GET THIS.",1020470400,3,591,4.166666666666667
1086256,5,6305869049,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when this DVD dropped through my mail box. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see top jazz musicians playing alongside a soul diva. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the Roland keyboards being played and a trumpet also being played by the same musician. Mark Stephens on piano is truly outstanding....his playing is inspirational. Chaka is very sexy and confident in her renditions of the old numbers.....many of which would have been popular long before she was born. The audience looked as though they expected a lot and they got it.....great DVD....
My wife and I have now watched this many times and just think it gets better and better with each viewing.  Amazing vocals and such an exciting voice.....when can we see her again??",996710400,11,777,4.798507462686567
1086257,5,6305869049,Somebody get this woman in the studio. Jazz is truly her calling. This DVD is testament to greater things to come from Chaka Khan.,996451200,3,130,4.458333333333333
1086258,5,6305869049,"If you are a Chaka Khan fan, then these few words have echoed in your ear a thousand and one times.  ""Chaka Khan is a true Diva!""  Her love for music is what I identifiy with when I hear her belt out a tune.  My appreciation for her work in the jazz/blues genre has now been rewarded with this once in a lifetime session captured on DVD by the folks over at BET on Jazz.
I was fortunate to have watched the broadcast of this program, but will enjoy it at my liesure when I'm in the mood to hear this diva at her best.",991872000,,517,3.9047619047619047
1086259,3,6305869049,"Warning- this is done in Dolby Digital and DTS ""surround""....... I put the disc in and heard nothing from the centre channel- thought my set up was faulty- but no - this is the way it seems to be recorded. Nevertheless fabulous concert and good sound quality. So- for the actual content 5 stars but degraded to 3 because of the technical confusion and poor menu.",990316800,2,362,4.5

1086262,4,6305869049,"Chaka Khan is one of the great vocalists of this generation. The Jazz selections only cement my opinion, and I love the 'human element' involved-her voice is a marvel even though it misses a FEW notes. She is a gem!!",973123200,,216,4.425
1086263,5,6305869049,"What a sheer delight it was to finally come across a treasure, appropriately titled ""The Jazz Channel Presents Chaka Khan,"" and on DVD.  For an hour I sat transfixed to the TV screen in awe as one of God's greatest voices belted out songs to uplift as well as melt you away.  Her renditions of jazz standards such as, ""Them there eyes"" and ""At the end of a love affair,"" made famous by jazz legend ""Billie Holiday,"" were pure electric. A few new tunes, ""Man From Mars"" and ""Soul Mates"", sung in that sexy, sultry way we C.K. fans have come to know as only ""Chaka"", and closing the set with ""Love Me Still"", definitivly an evening I'm sure the audience remembered as sweet and soothing to the heart and soul.  This DVD is a must for all die-hard Chaka Khan fans.  And if your smart you'll get it before it becomes an ""out of print"" collector's item. Chaka you just too ""bad"".",972604800,3,874,4.343558282208589
1086264,5,6305869049,"Chaka Khan flexes her amazing vocal chops and proves she can sing jazz with the best of them.  Yes, Chaka even scats (quite well I might add) on several of the numbers on this live recording.  Although this video is probably not for the jazz purist, it's definitely a must-have for any Chaka fan!  Chaka handles herself well on the jazz front, but don't expect a traditional jazz performance a la Ella Fitzgerald.  Some of the arrangements are a bit hokey and the band isn't exactly tight.  But I bought this for Chaka and she is in top form.  She sings in the low and middle tones with enough subtlety and nuance to counterbalance her incredible bursts of trademark belting when she sings in the higher registers.  The video shows that, at this point in her career, Chaka Khan has become a seasoned vocal performer with few rivals and one who can tackle almost any musical genre with aplomb.",972604800,5,892,4.572327044025157
1086333,5,6305869049,"Chaka's timeless pipes do great work in this concert. My guests where totally entertained and quite spellbound because they had not heard her perform live Jazz. If you are over the age of 45. You will love this work. Rememeber, extremely few get ""Live"" and perfect in the same review. I have only seem one. ""CHIC"" live at Montreau",1281312000,3,330,4.610169491525424
1086334,2,6305869049,"I am a huge Chaka Khan fan and have seen her sing jazz before but this video didn't meet my expectations at all.  It was kind of boring actually...old school jazz songs, wasn't what I was expecting at all and they should at least put the song list somewhere where you can see it before purchasing it.",1259625600,,300,4.2631578947368425
1086335,3,6305869049,"As noted by an ealier reviewer there is an engineering mishap with this BET Jazz DVD release. This performance by Chaka Khan is very good. but while the disk offers the DTS and 5.1 options it's rather the 2 channel stereo option (plus PL2 Music on my Sony amplifier) that channels sound into the center speaker, not the other two.

BET studios, if you're listening, please do correct this error.",1227139200,,395,4.642857142857143
1086336,4,6305869049,"In my libriary Of music concert DVDs I have a few that I play over and over again (Of Course on my high power dolby digital surround sound system, when the wife is not around, too loud?) I will tell you that some of the best sounding DVD concerts come from the guys at BET Jazz. The recording, mix and engineering of some of the DVD concerts from BET are great and this is one of them. First the band is great, seem to be top notch musicians she picked to perform with, but the amazing thing was it was just four of them and they sounded awesome throughout the whole performance. Chaka totally surpised a buddy and I who I called up right away and said to him you got to hear this DVD! We both grew-up in the era of Chaka Khan & Rufus and to hear her sing Jazz and to do it with her own sytle was very good, so good we were blown away and look at each other in disbelief as to what we were hearing. Needless to say we thought the concert was great and wonder why she doesn't do more jazz concerts or just jazz period. The vocal range was very wide, tone, pitch and balance of hear voice was very accurate. You can tell she is a veteran by the way she connected with the audience and the way she used the Shure Beta 58A mic as a true vocal instrument. Chaka performed some of the old jazz tunes like (My Funny Valentine),High Wire and others, These songs seem to be catered for her voice and range, thus allowing her to display her wide range of vocal talents. The songs she chose vocal wise can be very difficut to perform for any vocalist,  however she perfomed them with seemly ease, thus showing the audience that she was in complete control. I think that if Chaka were to totally commit herself to singing jazz she would become a force to be reckon with and in the future could be considered one of the top female jazz vocalist period.
If you love contemporary jazz trust me you will love this DVD, however please remember that this DVD concert is Chaka singing jazz not R&B or Soul, so please keep this in mind as you evaluate this DVD. Sounds best on a Dolby Digital DTS surround system. 4 3/4 Stars
Musicians: Chaka Khan-Vocals, Eddie Whiner-Horn & Keys, Mark Stephens Piano & Fender Rhodes, Melvin Davis-6 String Bass, Vincent Colaiuta-Gretsch Drums

1086337,3,6305869049,"Was very disappointed with this DVD.  From the very beginning I asked myself, ""Why did I order it""?  It didn't have the depth of character that is Chaka Khan.  It will not remain in my collection.

Someone who is looking for a more laid back sound will enjoy this one.",1124236800,,268,4.3
1086338,3,6305869049,"The reason Chaka doesnt really ""shine"" on this DVD is because of the band.  Though they are good musicians, I think they are BET studio musicians or something.  I've seen this on other BET DVDs that I own.  I am pretty sure that Chaka didn't pick the band on this production.  As such, I think she seems uninspired because the band doesnt give her a goal to hit.  I know if you brought out members of her previous live encounters you would really have something here.  She knows how to sing jazz and anybody who thinks otherwise has got rocks in their head.",1110412800,6,557,4.359223300970874
1086339,4,6305869049,"I first saw this video on a big screen at BB King's club in Times Sq, NYC and as a CK fan, I had to own a few copies. I found it most inspiring because she sings the standards, the funk and pop tunes in her own inimitable style. Anyone who is a CK fan will love this DVD.

1086340,3,6305869049,the show started off good&then around the middle of the show Chaka Khan just kinda went down from there.the Band was on point but Her vocals strayed&after a while it felt like She was just going through the Motions.if this Performance had have stopped early after a few songs then it would have been tight but it goes a bit to long.the Musicianship was tight throughout nevertheless.,1065225600,9,383,4.731343283582089
1086341,1,6305869049,"We bought this DVD on the strength of Chaka's excellent performance on Fourplay's ""An Evening of Fourplay"". However, my wife said after the second listening of this other DVD, that she is either out of her depth or she has chosen the wrong songs. I tend to agree - Chaka comes across like a less than smooth, poor man's version of Natalie Cole on this DVD. Her voice is OK in the lower register but it turns into a flat screechy monotone when she aims a bit higher. Her band is excellent and without them it would all be a total loss. In fact, we could easily have listened to the band alone - unfortunately their peformance is ruined by a less than stellar performance by Chaka Khan.",1042070400,5,684,4.3515625
1086342,5,6305869049,"Yes, Chaka Khan is the next Ella Fitzgerarld, because she has the potential to do all styles of music.  I love her! I have been a fan of Chaka Khan since she was with Rufus and she did ""Sweet Thing"", etc.  I have most of her music and I am reordering all her music on CD.  Why do I love her?  Because unlike other artists she knows HOW to sing with someone.  She never tries to outsing the artist she's accompanying.  She goes along with the moment and the aura of the song and whomever she's singing with.  Although,in this video she's singing solo with a great band, by the way the band is outstanding!  In this video Chaka hits notes with such an ease and she's goes to various ranges so naturally.  I am always impressed with this lady and to me she is THE QUEEN DIVA.  Chaka, when are you going to do a JAZZ album for your fans?  Is there a CD to this video and if not are there any JAZZ specific CD's available.  Even though I know that most of Chaka's music has Jazzy accents, after all ""She's Every Woman"". She knows how to make you feel whatever she's singing and put you in a mood.  Here and throughout all her music her sweetness comes through her voice because of the feeling and soul she puts into it.  Chaka your the best! Much more success to ya!",1028592000,6,1261,4.1570247933884295
7897395,5,6305869049,"I saw the concert on YouTube and I was geeked! The music is considered jazz and is from her fabulous CK album/CD which did not chart as well as Chaka's other efforts, but when I heard it I immediately loved it because I've been listening to jazz since I was a teen. If you LOVE pristine vocals with scatting, good music and musicianship (the band is TIGHT) you will love this DVD! Get into it...",1501459200,,395,4.28

I often sit in my living room and play this music over and over again. All of the musicians provide 'superb' accompaniment. I just regret the fact that I was not in attendance for this concert. Lady, Chaka, you truly were 'swinging' and giving your heart to this event. And the pianist was grooving along with the flugelhorn, bass and that rhythmic drum beat. The music is truly 'pumping' and a true blessing to behold. If you love great music, stop denying excellence and purchase this great work!!!",1460764800,2,646,4.776785714285714

7897404,5,6305869049,"I was unaware this concert existed until I was searching for stuff involving Vinnie Colaiuta. This DVD captures a jazz performance with Chaka Khan and world-class musicians. Sound quality is really good, unlike a lot of concert recordings. Chaka still has the vocal range, although in a couple of spots it sounded like she had bit of trouble keeping the note. I do agree with the reviewer who said that she seemed disconnected from the audience, but that didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the performance. Fwiw, was anyone drinking anything at the concert? Everyone's glass seemed to be empty except for the bass player's.",1366156800,2,626,4.9714285714285715
