Her latest work "" Mataharis "" tells the story of three female private detectives , Eva , Inez and Carmen , all working at the same investigations office . Although inicially more occupied with their job obligations , the matters of the heart eventually take the center stage .
Like her past offerings "" Flowers Of Another World "" about immigration and integrasion and "" Hi ! Are You Alone "" which focused on female friendship , "" Mataharis "" is another small triumpth for the director : an intelligent little film which deals with it's delicant issues in a sensitive and humane way .
