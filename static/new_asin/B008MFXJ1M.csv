8528930,1,B008MFXJ1M,I haven't been able to play the DVD at all.  I have the NTSC side up.  I only get errors saying File reading failed: VLC could not read the file (Bad file descriptor).  I flipped the disk over just in case but get the same error.  Im using VLC Media Player and have no issues playing other DVDs.,1518134400,,295,4.0344827586206895
8528931,4,B008MFXJ1M,"This is a foreign DVD so you need to play the NTSC side up for the English version. The PAL is the German side and will only give errors for your US players. While I haven't finished watching it, I needed to revise my other review because I could finally play it.  So far, it's a good DVD if you want more information on how to long rein, although a bit light on the troubleshooting with a horse new to long reining.",1433721600,,416,4.073170731707317
