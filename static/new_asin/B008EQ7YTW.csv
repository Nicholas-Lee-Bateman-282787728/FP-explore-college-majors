I contact the vendor and they agree to have the disc send back to japan for a full refund.  I used it as a gift to my Japanese friend. It ends well as in the movie.",1367452800,,303,4.224137931034483
8577203,5,B008EQ7YTW,"I just saw this film in the theatre in its West Coast release, so I can't comment on the technical aspects of the DVD, but I am happy to see that it is available in BluRay all-region format.

This is a Japanese family drama in the Ozu style, but with more fluid action and a bit more physicality than one generally finds in Ozu.  The plot, based on the autobiographical novel by Yasushi Inoue, tells the story of the author's alienation from his mother and final reconciliation with her.  Unfortunately, by the time he recognizes the truth of her love, his mother is so demented that she does not recognize him any more.  When she dies, he reconciles with her within himself, and in the process also reconciles himself with his family, whom he has alienated over the years.  It is a touching story well told - bring plenty of tissues.

The film is set in the past, from 1955 to 1973.  To maintain the time illusion, most of the scenes occur in old family homes in the countryside, or in hotels and city interiors, except for one scene at a truckers' restaurant.  Masato Harada, the director, uses contemporary film technique rather than the tatami level camera Ozu made famous.  The outdoor scenery with the change of seasons is gorgeously evocative.  It is a visually beautiful film.  At least 80% of the frames are of still photo quality, by my impression, approaching Ozu's level of perfection.

Some of the plot and day-to-day behavior may be a bit impenetrable to viewers unfamiliar with Japanese family life, but are consistent with the dynamics of the Japanese family presented in Ozu's films.  Feelings of obligation and connectedness are very evident, and the changes brought about by modern life are made clear as well.  For example, one daughter goes away to university in Hawaii, a huge step for a young Japanese woman in 1973, but in a very Japanese way the whole family goes to Hawaii on the ship with her to help ""settle her in"".  Some American viewers may be offended by the dominant paternal role taken by the main character, but to me it was refreshing to see a father who was not portrayed as being a clueless idiot and figure of ridicule.

If you have the opportunity to see this film on the big screen, please do so.  I assume the BluRay edition will also be well worth watching.",1361577600,2,2300,4.598039215686274
