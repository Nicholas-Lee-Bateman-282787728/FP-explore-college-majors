8277164,5,B001AE4PBA,"This is a rare and precious documentary on a little known subject: the organ. The instrument was invented by the Alexandrian hydrologist Ctsebius in the 3rd. C. BC. The earliest organs were called hydroaulos by the Greeks and hydraulis by the Romans. The instrument was played extensively throughout the Roman Empire (games, ceremonies, rituals). Later the Church adopted and adapted it for the purpose of worship. Thru the Catholic Church the organ evolved over the centuries up to the present day. This DVD is the 1st of a 4 part series. Good visuals and superb playing rounds out this documentary.",1404259200,,600,5.01
8277165,5,B001AE4PBA,"If you want to see a history of classical organs and music spanning from Roman to modern times, this is a great way to see European talent and huge antique organs. The good news is that there's dialog explaining what you'll see, but the talking ends and then it's uninterrupted music. I especially enjoyed the concerts when played through a 2000 watt amplifier on my band gig setup and subwoofer the size of a refrigerator.",1394928000,2,423,4.653333333333333

I now have the complete set of 4 and I find them a wonderous collections of fantastic organs, organists and sounds and video.  A treasure of the King of Instraments.  A MUST HAVE.
