8476930,5,B005KLUDQK,"This is a comprehensive review of the beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels of men's gymnastics that should be a building block for any men's program looking to build up their knowledge of skills to get their athletes to progress to the next level. This is not a, ""Learn How to Tumble"" YouTube series but a comprehensive guide by the Head Coach at the University of Oklahoma, Mark Williams, who was inducted into the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2015, who won seven NCAA titles in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2015, and 2016, and who was our Head Men's Coach at the 2016 Rio Olympics! He has coached many athletes to the Olympic level. This knowledge should be valued and it is truly great that he is passing along his mastery to future coaches. I'm the Head Coach of a USAG Men's Team Program in New Jersey and I am going to have my recreational, pre-team, and competitive boy's coaches watch it. That's how comprehensive this guide is.

Now I'm not going to lie, the presentation is a little dry and it was probably done on a shoestring budget, but the substance was there. If someone is truly trying to learn all about men's gymnastics they can overlook those issues. That is why I am giving this product five stars.",1490140800,2,1228,4.5565610859728505
8476931,2,B005KLUDQK,"I bought this set of DVD's thinking that it was going to be a step by step tutorial on how to strength train like a gymnast. It's not! This set of DVDs is meant for coaches or athletes to train for SKILLS not for strength or conditioning. I bought this product because at the time the gymnasticbodies.com website were out of stock of the book ""Building the Gymnastics Body"", so I chose this as an alternative. Unless you want to learn how to tumble or do handsprings, you should skip this product. It is not for an average joe that simply wants to do planche push ups or front lever pullups and other gymnastics strength exercises. This product for gymnastic athletes that want to perform the skills required in the sport.",1332374400,5,722,4.519083969465649
