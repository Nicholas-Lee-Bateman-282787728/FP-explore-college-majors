8571123,2,B00BMUKZUC,"I bought this immediately after seeing the trailer. I thought it would be creepy and have a good surreal mystery, but I was disappointed. Its really nothing more than talking. The deaths are tame and the story dull. The pace was also extremely slow with nothing to keep the audience entertained.

The black and white makes the film looks classy. The sound was clear.",1469577600,,366,4.71875
8571124,5,B00BMUKZUC,"I rented this from Bl*ckb*st*r first because I knew this was a lot different from Richard Marr-Griffin's other films.  It was in black & white and didn't aim for laughs along with the shocks.  After one watch through I placed my order.  It is excellent filmmaking.  It is disturbing and very thoughtful.  Calling it a horror film would be doing a disservice to the film and to potential viewers.  It is not a slasher/supernatural shock fest.  It is a slow burn which raises a lot of questions that you won't find quick and easy answers for.  If you want a dumb horror/gore flick you have lots of options out there.  If you want something that stays in your brain, buy Exhumed now.  Debbie Rochon and Michael Thurber take the lead with Rochon offering spurts of crazed violence while Thurber is much more restrained, you get the feeling that his character doesn't really like what he does, but he does it all the same, knowing that he will eventually be held accountable.  Sarah Nicklin and Michael Reed again prove why they are becoming the go-to actors for indie horror, Rich Trethaway moves further away from his more comedic past performances and newcomer Evalena Marie provides a cool sexiness to the film.  Guy Benoit's script is sharp and spare.  The characters all have a past we only get tiny glimpses of, but are fully rounded.  And of course RMG's direction is above anyone else in the field.  He can do with $20 thousand what Hollywood can't with $20 million.",1380585600,4,1470,4.665369649805448
8571125,3,B00BMUKZUC,"When I saw the rating of this movie I was a little surprised.

I saw ""exhumed"" at the premiere and bought the DVD. I thought
it was a very solid indie horror. Richard Griffin did a fine
job directing a solid indie cast. Ken Willinger did a fantastic
job as Cinematographer. I thought it was one of the better indie
horror films I'd seen in awhile.

The story is paced well and the acting is very solid. Evalena Marie
did a solid job as the lead Rocki. And horror icon Sarah Nicklin
was awesome as usual. Michael reed and Michael Thurber also stood out.

I think people are less patient with low budget indies. And it's sport to
trash them. But if you want to go into a movie like Exhumed and want to
enjoy it you will. If you just want to blast a movie because it doesn't have
big stars and a million dollar budget it doesn't matter if it's solid.
You will just find some reason to kill it.

I like Griffin's films and look forward to seeing many more.",1379980800,2,952,4.185792349726776
8571126,1,B00BMUKZUC,"I don't know where the reviewer Timothy Collins got all of his ""spoiler alerts"" information because most of what he writes is not even remotely obvious in the film.  And giving it five stars?  Well,  look at all of his reviews and you will see he gives everything five stars.  Thank you for skewing the review bell, Mr. Collins.

This movie is boring, does not explain what the heck is going on, and you have to wonder, where did the title come from? You would be better off if you read a good book and skipped this altogether.",1378166400,,527,4.336734693877551

Scorpio Films Releasing is famous for doing comedic horror films that are often outrageous and always entertaining. On this film they decided to go with a straight psychological horror film that delves into the minds of people slowing going mad. The film centers around the last 5 members of a cult that believed that the outside was poison and the only way to survive was to stay in select houses. Almost the entire film is shot in the last house the cult has. Inside the house the world has stopped for them. Each character deals with the stagnation in their own way. Due to financial issues the group ahs to allow an outsider to move into the house and his arrival starts the final descent. Excellently cast with Debbie Rochon as the Governess with Michael Thurber as the Butler the defacto leaders. Sarah Nicklin plays Laura the daughter of the cult founders who died when she was a small child. Rich Tretheway is Lance a burnt out musician who stopped playing when he faces the fact that the cult is dying. Evalena Marie is Rocky, the last person to join this branch of the cult and the most rebellious members. Rounding out the cast is Michael Reed as Chris an average college student looking to live out of the dorms. The film is moody and very dark but still the characters are all compelling and the story holds you until the final reel.",1371772800,7,1467,4.967479674796748
