8357501,1,B002955OUK,Spent $30 on one DVD that was supposedly new and it already had a scratch on it!!  Couldn'the even get thru the first workout because of the damage.  Complete waste of money!,1493424000,,174,4.40625
8357502,5,B002955OUK,"I am devastated because I misplaced my DVD of the Air Climber workouts and the DVD's are not available at Amazon or EBay.  This is a great workout, takes just 20-30 minutes to do at home, uses cardiac muscles as well as arm muscles, back muscles and abs.  Come on, Jane Fonda workouts were forever ago and this workout is fabulous in my book.  If anyone has the DVD, I'd be happy to purchase.  If you are looking for a great, all over workout, this is it. The recommendations now are to use different types of exercise so I use this along with walking 3-5 miles a day three times a week and I am 64 years old and still able to do this level of exercise. Love it!",1327795200,2,662,4.108527131782946
8357503,1,B002955OUK,"This workout I purchased because I have the air climber and that doesnt work good either. Brenda Dygraf was def cheap on cash. I can create a better dvd than this, its all talk no action.",1310947200,,187,4.222222222222222
8357504,1,B002955OUK,"This is one of the tired videos I ever saw and I am a veteran with exercise videos, all the way back to the first Jane Fonda VHS! There's NO WAY Brenda Degraf got her abs from her own boring exercise route!",1300233600,2,206,3.9285714285714284
