8065457,3,B0009R143Q,We usually get this video from the library and the boys really enjoy it.  This copy was not in very good shape and stops when it reaches certain places.  Should have purchased new instead of used,1295395200,,195,4.388888888888889
8065458,5,B0009R143Q,"This Wink & Blink episode is a favorite with my kids (ages 2 and 5) because it answered questions about something they see all the time - the Garbage Truck!  The live-action characters are goofy and fun.  There is some time spent in make-believe lands, but most of the footage is on-site.

More than just following the truck around a neighborhood, A Day in the Life of a Garbage Truck! is thought-provoking and creates awareness of issues like recycling and environmental preservation.  It also shows how the garbage trucks are built and maintained.

The songs and music are pleasant and lively.  The bonus footage is great!

There are a couple other episodes in the Wink & Blink series, and hopefully, will be even more in the near future.",1195689600,,740,4.734375
8065459,1,B0009R143Q,"This video is awful.  It doesn't hold my son's attention, neither of us can stand the kids/acting and it is cheesy.  The Real Wheels series is better and more watchable.",1190678400,,169,4.6
8065460,5,B0009R143Q,"My four-year-old cannot get enough of this dvd.  He is obsessed with garbage trucks and this dvd is entertaining and educational for him.  I do find Wink and Blink get on my nerves, but I have to remember that the movie wasn't made for me, it was made for a preschooler.  He loves all the footage and the song about garbage.  A good investment for this household!",1174003200,,363,4.373134328358209
8065461,4,B0009R143Q,"My almost 2 year old son is a garbage truck fanatic.  He talks about them all the time, likes to play garbage truck, and runs to watch the garbage trucks every Tuesday morning.  We watch very little television, but I decided to get this video for the occasional special treat.  It is a very in-depth look at garbage trucks from how they are built, to how various types of trucks (front loaders, side loaders, and rear loaders) operate, to what goes on at the landfill.  As an added bonus for my son, there are digger trucks and dump trucks at the landfill that push dirt around.  The video is about 30 minutes long and then there is probably another 30 minutes of bonus footage (more of the same).  I put this video on for my son once when he was very tired but it was too early to go to bed and he watched the whole hour, rapt.

I do find Wink and Blink and the 3 kids that are in the video annoying in a Barney sort of way.  There is this stupid subplot about needing to find magic keys so that Wink and Blink can return to the land of imagination.  I fast forwarded through most of those parts so we could get back to the garbage trucks which is all my son really cares about.

I found out later that this video is in our local public library.  I wish I had known that because I do not know if it was worth it to buy this given how rarely I let my son watch TV.  For those that do watch more TV, you might consider whether this video will be watched over and over again.  My son probably would, but an older child might get bored.  You might want to check your local library to preview the video and make sure your kids like it before buying.",1142899200,,1645,4.08411214953271
8065462,5,B0009R143Q,"I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old.  They both love watching this DVD.  It is my younger boy's favorite.  My older son especially enjoys the scenes from the garbage truck factory.  I would recomend it for any preschooler who has a love for trucks, especially garbage trucks.",1125792000,3,276,4.352941176470588
