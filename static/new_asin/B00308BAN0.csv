4042957,5,B00308BAN0,This is a great DVD to help you start to get into shape.  I also find it fun.,1273968000,2,77,3.2777777777777777
4042958,5,B00308BAN0,"This DVD is worth the price just for the lovely Chakra meditation. The 12 minute meditation is lead by James D'Silvia. He has a lovely soothing voice. You can use this meditation any time of day to center yourself and is easy to follow.

This is one of four DVDs in a series by Trudie Styler (although James is the star of the show). The ballet routine includes many of the moves that are in the Cardio dance video and is easy to follow flow moves like the other DVDs. It is not a difficult routine. There are two practices on the DVD and the only difference is the first one includes Trudie and uses a ballet bar (which I don't have) and the second uses two chairs and only includes James. James has a wonderful style that makes these exercise videos interesting and fun!

There is an extra that shows Sting and Trudie's Tuscan estate. It is a beautiful place and they are beautiful people, but..... It made me sad, this beautiful big bass fish dead on the plate as they seasoned him up for cooking...for their life that is so wonderful. They have their own cooks and more resources that most of us. It seemed more of bragging than anything. I did not mark down on my 5-star rating of the video since the routine was so great!

See many of my other review on Amazon, includes the others in this series.",1271980800,8,1303,4.331967213114754
4042959,4,B00308BAN0,"I like the DVD because it does give you a ballet-based barre with nice music by David Hartley.  I wish other exercise companies would take a clue from this DVD and use decent music for ballet inspired workouts instead of the elevator crap or up-beat contemporary music which is usually offered. I understand that not everyone likes classical music, but doing ballet to elevator music is torture for me. The music here is serene but at the same time emotional, definitely not elevator music or 1980's jazzercise music either. As for the workout, the steps are ballet-inspired but some exercises are not done in the typical barre order, and some typical ballet barre exercises are missing. My only complaint is that I wish the DVD were longer and had some center work or some floor core work.  I also feel that some ballet experience is needed to do this workout.  If you have had some ballet training and would like to stay in shape at home, I would recommend this DVD over other workouts because the music is better(New York City Ballet workouts have wonderful classical music selections).  I also like how the exercises continue without explanation and stopping, but if you have not had any ballet training the lack of explanations will be a determent.  The workout is only one routine that is shown on a barre and a chair.",1271289600,24,1324,4.714285714285714
4042960,1,B00308BAN0,"The constant voiceover is obnoxious and distracting. I never broke a sweat, and 25 minutes is not nearly long enough to be a good ballet workout. I'll stick to the NYC ballet workouts going forward.",1335744000,,198,4.685714285714286
4042961,5,B00308BAN0,"I absolutely LOVE this dvd. I have several done by Trudie and her trainer, and this is probably my #1.
I have asthma, and doing cardio has always been really difficult for me because of it. This gives me just the right amount of cardio.
And I feel a difference the next day! I actually only do this dvd when I am off the next day or two because my legs are so sore after... but its that good kind of sore!",1334016000,5,405,3.951219512195122
4042962,4,B00308BAN0,This is a great DVD for anyone who has some ballet experience but needs a little push.  The instruction is fast.  Up to tempo of the music.  Would not be good for someone who needs step by step footwork instruction.  I feel like I've had a good work out at the end.,1325894400,3,265,4.038461538461538
4042963,5,B00308BAN0,"I really enjoy this DVD.  As a mom of twins I have not worked out consistently for a long time, and this was the perfect DVD to start getting me back into shape.  I took some ballet in college, so I was familiar with the terms.  It might be to confusing for someone who has had no ballet experience.  I find the DVD has a calming quality and a nice flow to the exercises.  The ballet isn't boring for me as so many other exercise DVDs are.",1304553600,6,439,4.0
4042964,4,B00308BAN0,"since  Trudie Styler's face is on the cover,I was a little bit confused that she wasn't the  instructor in this DVD. But I found I really like JAMES DASILVA's voice and style ,I wish the DVD were longer and had some center work.",1301184000,3,228,4.27906976744186
4042965,4,B00308BAN0,"This is a well-produced ballet DVD with Trudie Styler and instructor James DaSilva. The Bonus Features are not to be missed! Catching a peek at Sting & Trudie's Italian estate and their eco-farming is inspirational. Now onto the 25 minute Barre Routine: compared to using the chairs, this is such a pretty routine to watch that is. Watching ballet with Trudie & James did not seem intimidating. On the other hand, I worked out with The Chair Routine (25 minutes) and even though you do the same exact routine as the Barre, I found it challenging when the moves were in vertical direction and the pace was quicker. James was calling out positions fast ""passe, chasse, arabesque, tendu"". This is why I felt pretty winded both mentally and physically. So, get familiar with the ballet terms and positions for the feet AND arms in the Footwork Tutorial. If you had some ballet, it would be helpful.",1294704000,9,894,4.737179487179487
4042966,3,B00308BAN0,"PROS: I actually did work up a sweat. It is fast paced and will probably take you a few times to keep up with the pace and flow. I'm not too terribly sore today, but since it was my first time I may not have been giving it my all as I was trying to keep up with the video instead of focusing on my technique.

CONS: I was dissappointed that Trudie Styler wasn't actually doing the exercises. If your face is on the cover, you should probably participate in the excercises or else I don't really buy your endorsement. I also found the narrators voice to be a bit goofy and annoying. It just wasn't what I expected but I will still use it from time to time. However, I think I'll try one of the other ballet workout dvds.",1286841600,4,719,4.099290780141844
4042967,5,B00308BAN0,"I thought I might be disappointed with the workout because it's only 25 minutes, but I found that it perfectly rounds out the other barre workouts I do (the Bar Method, Pure Barre and Core Fusion). Because of its deep bends and stretches and rapid pace and flow, it becomes a cardio workout if you apply the necessary focus. It is empowering, yet calming and meditative with its physicality and I need this to complete my physical fitness routine. The production is great, it's so aesthetic to the eye and ear. It's unfortunate that ""the Buddha"" is offensive to some. For me, it's not a promotion of religion, but rather a symbol of peace, love and harmony with the earth and does not seek to disregard anyone's religious beliefs.",1285459200,12,730,4.666666666666667
4042968,2,B00308BAN0,"I did not like this workout. It goes too fast and also, visually, I'm not sure why it is necessary to have the instructor doing ballet in front of a big Buddha statue the whole time. I find it distracting and annoying. I am a Christian but I would find it equally odd if there was a giant cross sitting behind the workout instructor. For me it comes off as a religious promotion and is intrusive to me. In fact, I have seen other workout videos by Gaiam productions and this seems to be the case in at least 2 other videos. I understand that they produce a lot of yoga videos and they use these types of symbols, but something about it bothers me. I don't like it and am returning it and will not buy any other of their products for that reason.

I just recently reviewed this review and almost deleted it because there were very few helpful votes & a few upset comments. So I re-read it to see if I could make it more helpful but I am changing nothing other than recommending some ballet dvd's that I do think are great. I realize that some people out there are upset by me being annoyed by a giant Buddha statue in the DVD but reviews are about saying why you like or dislike something. So if it's because the steps go too fast (being able to keep up definitely determines if you're going to use the video again or enjoy it) or the set is very distracting to you then those are valid reasons not to like a video. Any kind of large religious symbol (not just Buddha) in a ballet video would be out of place & distracting to me and I have never seen anything like this in any ballet studio. Seems like propaganda to me but if you don't mind that and are more experienced in picking up dance steps quickly then by all means buy it. My review stands. The ballet DVD's I highly recommend are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kari-Anderson-Reach-Upbeat-Toning-Flexibility-for-a-Dancer-s-Body/dp/B000EGDN68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kari Anderson: Reach - Upbeat Toning & Flexibility for a Dancer's Body</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Ballet-Conditioning/dp/B000WC38BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Ballet Conditioning</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-York-City-Ballet-Workout/dp/B000056MMR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New York City Ballet Workout</a>.",1279670400,9,2434,5.528150134048257
4042969,3,B00308BAN0,"I bought this video because I really enjoy ballet and ballet inpsired  workouts, but I have yet to actually do this workout.  I watched once through to get an idea and haven't touched it since.  The pacing seemed really fast to me, and frankly, the non-stop voice over is really annoying.  There's hardly a moment when the narrator isn't talking.  The camera jumps around quite a bit and focuses more on Trudi's personal trainer than on her, which makes it hard to get a good idea of exactly what they're doing at a level of someone who is not a professional fitness guru.  The video was fairly short- the first section with the barre is simply repeated with chairs in the other section.
The biggest thing for me is the voice over and jumping camera.  I know people have complained about the narration on NYCBallet's workout, but I'd rather have the unobtrusive seemingly out of place narrator from that workout than the overbearing one on this DVD.",1278374400,8,949,4.6467065868263475
