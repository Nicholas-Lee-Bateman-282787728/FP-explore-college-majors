4906675,5,B005Z3EAYE,"I'm not sure why I purchased this blu-ray. I had never heard of the film or Lionel Rogosin before. I watched it once, put it away. Came back to the bonus film but didn't give it much thought until recently. I dug up the disc and watched it again and was floored. On The Bowery is a powerful film of hopeless men bumbling along blindly in a world of addiction. For some reason I watched this film filled with a certain  there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I feeling. Here are men - almost all men with the exception of a couple of rough-looking dames - that once had families, dreams. Now a bunch of booze-fueled wastes, feuding and hustling for a few dollars (for drinks) during the day and passed out on the pavement in rumpled and dirty heaps at night. Each the potential victim of his desperate fellow Bowery dwellers. Watch it for a slice of old New York that has long since been bulldozed by yuppie cafes and boutiques, the El disappeared.

The full-frame blu-ray image looks great - much better than the SD clips shown in the extras. The audio is a bit muffled and some of the ""actors"" speech is rather garbled so don't expect a showcase 5.1 sound. Overall a highly recommended trip thru a seedy demi-monde that (hopefully) few will ever experience.",1360108800,6,1253,4.614349775784754
4906676,5,B005Z3EAYE,"These are 2 amazing films/documentaries. Especially On The Bowery.
I remember those days as a young kid. Brought back memories of a very sad time and place.
Well done, a must see for those he like reality.",1354838400,2,205,4.5675675675675675
4906677,4,B005Z3EAYE,"This film must have made a big impact in its time. I recall a documentary around 1953 about Chicago's Madison Ave, its ""dirty backyard"" if I remember accurately. On the Bowery is better, a slice of life among the alcoholics, mostly men, who existed in that time and place. I would like to have seen someone going to AA. It's been around since 1935 and must have had meetings on the Bowery. The church meeting in the film comes the closest to this. On the Bowery is a trip back into the past, to a NYC that I never saw. I bought the DVD from Amazon.com.",1352937600,2,552,4.216981132075472
4906678,5,B005Z3EAYE,This movie is a must see. It was easy for me to get past the scripted docu-drama angle. The faces in this film speak to the ages. These are battered men moving though purgatory. The added footage and extras alone are worth the price. Know that these men are damaged and many were WW2 vets.,1351296000,3,289,4.2727272727272725
4906679,5,B005Z3EAYE,"Great looking blu-ray shot on skid row in NYC allows you to spend some time with all kinds of unsavory characters who like to sleep on the sidewalk....this docudrama is really something....

4906680,5,B005Z3EAYE,"Distinctly authentic, unrehearsed, true-to-life documentary where the participants seem totally unaware of the camera.

4906681,5,B005Z3EAYE,"A great neo realist doc-u-drama filmed on New York's Bowery in the early 1950's. Before the Bowery Hotel, Whole Food's and the New Museum - this is what the Bowery was like. Unflinching and tender, this is one of the great New York City films.",1333152000,3,243,4.4222222222222225
4906682,5,B005Z3EAYE,"""On the Bowery"" is one of those movies that will not ring a bell for most audiences, but may be recognized by true film connoisseurs.  I certainly didn't know about it, and I have to thank the hard-working folks at Milestone, folks that truly love films and try to preserve some of the best ones before there are sent to oblivion. Thanks to them, we got to see restored versions of such classics as ""I am Cuba,"" ""Killer of Sheep,"" ""Araya,"" and many others. Now we have the historically important and remarkable ""On the Bowery,"" helmed by Lionel Rogosin, who was described by John Cassavettes as ""probably the greatest documentary filmmaker of all time.""

""On the Bowery"" is one special film, in which it is a documentary, with a scripted and improvised story, and with some willingly and unwillingly unprofessional actors. Makes sense? It shouldn't, but it does. Director Rogosin tried to show to the world life at New York's Bowery area, kind of what we today refer to as skid row, an area inhibited by what appears to be unemployed men and women - mostly men --, who are either waking up each day on its street or having ""breakfast"" at a bar. Sadly, alcohol is the common factor. For this noble purpose, Rogolin enlisted some of the men that actually frequented the bowery. The main one, Ray Salyer, plays himself, and we see him arriving to the bowery with just a suitcase and some money; he claims to be a railroad worker. He looks fine and well-kept, and, for some reason chooses to go to a bar as his first stop. Even though he has seen and felt the evil of booze, he is weak and agrees to have a drink with some fellows that he meets in the bar. He befriends two of them, who happen to be older: Gorman Hendricks and Frank Matthews, who, like him, live day by day looking for one-day jobs and some quick money, which, sadly, will end up in the bar's cash register. The movie consists mostly on the daily activities of Ray, from the moment that he wakes up from sleeping on the street, to how he is able to get a job for a day, and getting back to the bar at the end of the day - quite a repetitive and destructive cycle. We only see Frank for about half of the film, as he mysteriously disappears. Gorman, on the other hand, is quite a character; he is dishonest, but can also have a good heart. We follow their daily struggles until the very end... almost.  With good reason a pastor at a local church, which is the gate to get food and shelter for some nights, said that the Bowery was ""the saddest and maddest street in the world.""

""On the Bowery"" is slow but it surely penetrates your soul, and, in the end, you will conclude that it is quite a powerful film. For good reason it earned an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary in 1958, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary in 1957, as well as was included in the National Film Registry by the National Film Preservation Board USA in 2008.  Personally, what I will mostly remember about this film is the faces and the eyes. They spoke a world about the lives at this side of the United States. I shall also mention that all three main characters had great faces for film. Salyer reminded me of a mixture of Mike Wallace with John Cassavettes, while Gorman reminded me of Keenan Wynn. It is said that Salyer was offered roles in Hollywood, but he chose to keep drinking. Gorman, on the other hand, lived enough to the end of production of the film, and Frank died somewhere in-between. Needless to say, this is one of the best movies about alcoholism that you will ever see. It will stay with you for quite some time. The wonderful two-disc Blu-ray edition includes a Martin Scorsese introduction to the film, a making-of documentary, as well a the documentaries ""A Walk Through the Bowery"" and ""Bowery Men Shelter."" It also includes ""Good Times, Wonderful Times,"" a 1964 film by Rogosin, a making-of documentary of the movie, and much, much, more.

4906683,5,B005Z3EAYE,"The Blu-Ray and DVD editions contain two feature films: ON THE BOWERY and GOOD TIMES, WONDERFUL TIMES as well as Rogosin's ""lost"" film, OUT.

For songwriter Woody Guthrie, his guitar was a machine that ""kills fascists."" For Lionel Rogosin, the weapon of choice was a movie camera, and his first battle was waged on the streets of New York City.

Exploring the underworld of the city's skid row, Rogosin developed his signature style. After months drinking with men he met on the Bowery, Rogosin worked with his buddies to write a screenplay that reflected their lives--and then cast them as themselves. This technique of making films ""from the inside"" allowed Rogosin to film ordinary people caught up in universal problems. His films explored alcoholism, homelessness, racial discrimination, war, labor conflict, and poverty with great compassion and honesty.

On the Bowery chronicles three days in the drinking life of Ray Salyer, a part-time railroad worker adrift on New York's skid row. When the film opened it 1956, it exploded on the screen, burning away years of Hollywood artifice, jump-starting the post-war American independent film movement and earning an Oscar nomination. Now gloriously restored by the Cineteca di Bologna, On the Bowery is both an incredible document of a bygone era and a vivid and devastating portrait of addiction that resonates today just as it did when it was made.

Good Times, Wonderful Times was Rogosin's powerful response to militarism and fascism. For two years, Rogosin traveled to twelve countries, amassing footage of war atrocities from national archives. He then interspersed these harrowing images with scenes of a London cocktail party's inane chatter. The juxtaposition satirizes the tragic irresponsibility of modern man. Good Times, Wonderful Times, released at the height of the Vietnam conflict, became one of the great antiwar films of the era.

Out, a documentary by Rogosin made for the United Nations, tells the plight of Hungarian refugees fleeing to Austria in the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

8489407,5,B005Z3EAYE,"My father had a store on the Bowery from the 1930's to 1960. It was one block south (of Delancey) while this appears to have been shot one or more blocks north of Delancey. I had many memories as a child going to my father's store to help him out and encountering ""the bums"", oftentimes asleep in the shallow doorway of my father's business. Urine and feces were frequent accoutrements which had to be cleaned before the start of business for the day. Lyons House Hotels were all around.
It is very hard to find photos of this section of the Bowery at this time in New York History. But seeing this brought back not only many images of what it was like, but the sounds of the people that I had all but forgotten.
This is a powerful movie, especially if you had any personal connection to the area at the time. But the set of movies and Rogosin's stories are powerful for anyone with a commitment to social conscience and social justice. On some of the supplementary material there are photos of the Eastern European Jewry under the Nazi's that I had never seen before- and I have watched a lot of material on WWII and the Holocaust. In  addition, there is, to me , new material from Japan related to the nuclear explosions.
These are powerful anti-war movies which, alas, seem as relevant today, although the particular players in war change every few years. This is very inexpensive exposure to meaningful art-a tribute to Rogosin and his family to preserving and presenting them.",1406073600,4,1481,4.567669172932331

8489412,5,B005Z3EAYE,"I am 63 years old, and the product of an alcoholic father. Though it skipped me in some ways--I am not addicted to the usual substances or behaviors--addiction has had a devastating effect on my life. My daughter was in the throes of drug and alcohol addiction for ten years, from age 13 until 23. This caused untold pain and misery in our family.

I am also a movie fanatic. I've seen literally thousands of movies. In particular I admire and deeply appreciate documentary films, because they show us reality, and, more than fiction films, they have the power to influence our thoughts and actions. They often shine a light into the dark corners of this world. This is such a film. I watched it last night on Turner Classics. I was astounded. I am embarrassed and reluctant to admit it, but prior to last night, I had never heard of Lionel Rogosin. Based upon this single film, I would rate him as one of the greatest filmmakers of all-time. This is a truly singular, extraordinary piece of work, simply amazing. It is tremendously sad and moving, frightening film, because while I watched it I could not help but think ""there but for the grace of God.""

There was a movie made years ago called The Exiles which came close to this. Then there is the monumental Eugene O'Neill play, The Iceman Cometh, which could have inspired, or was inspired by, this film.

Rogosin lived and drank with these alcoholic men of NYC's Bowery for many months, his aim being to befriend the men and to be accepted by them. I am sure he bought plenty of drinks in this time. None of these guys were actors; they were real people, real 'winos' and boozers who lived on those mean streets. They got so used to him that when he started filming them, they didn't bat an eye. No doubt he came up with a 'story', and discussed it with the three guys who are featured in the movie. Every cent that came into their hands ended up in the hands of the bartenders or cashiers who manned the dives and liquor stores in that seedy district. The main character, Ray Salyer, is a tall, lanky youngish fellow, a good-looking guy who had a kind of Gary Cooper/Henry Fonda quality to him. After the movie on TCM, host Robert Osborne said that this chap was actually offered a $40K acting gig by a studio, but he turned it down, saying that booze was the only thing he cared about. Ironically at the end of the film, his character actually turns down a drink, saying that he intends to get cleaned up and get a job. Gorman, the older white-haired man who swipes Ray's suitcase, died of cirrhosis before the film was even released.

The movie is full of fantastic scenes, but of course, absolutely none of them are what you would call uplifting. You sit there in open-mouthed amazement, in a way, like looking at a train wreck or a burning building. It has been beautifully restored and the glorious black and white images of old NYC are simply incredible. Nothing like this has ever been done. But the truly amazing images are those faces....craggy, wrinkled, battered, ravaged by alcohol and beatings, lack of food and care, from sleeping rough on cold concrete. These poor men are sons and husbands and fathers, many no doubt WWII vets, and they are on a slow path to death and destruction. For them, the numbness of that boozy high is the be-all and end-all. But the sad saga repeats itself day after day.

The movie takes place over three days, presumably in the summer, which makes you wonder how these poor fellows survived in the cold months. One incredible scene actually shows, in close-up detail, the legendary process of straining Sterno--canned heat--through an old sock, then drinking it. That could not have been good for your health. These guys were so alcohol addicted that they would have done liquid shoe polish, rubbing alcohol, radiator fluid, you name it. Like many homeless alcoholics, there is a preference but mostly a compulsion for the cheapest drunk possible, and so, cheap, fortified wines like Muscatel and White Port are a good route to getting 'comfortably numb'.

I've known men like this. Most of them are long dead. They 'chose' booze over family, job, home. This is a cautionary tale. I have always been very careful about drinking, because of what it did to my father, who died of cirrhosis, as did his sister. My paternal grandparents, my daughter, my sister and brother and several nephews have all been hit by ""The Curse"". I never drink alone, and when I drink, I have one or two beers. That's it. I go to a church which is full of alcoholics and addicts. I am going to recommend that we show this film. It is that powerful.",1363219200,13,4625,4.579710144927536
