4330162,5,B004CYF758,"I love that the Paleyfest panels are available on Prime. If you like TV and are looking for something to have on in the background that you don't have to pay close attention to visually, these are perfect.  A great way to find out the inside scoop on how your favorite characters came to be and what the process is for getting the show from the writer's room to your TV set.",1388534400,5,374,4.194444444444445
4330163,5,B004CYF758,Good to have the whole crew. You get a real sense of what it takes to develop this show. Especially inciteful is the decisions to no film before a live audience. they have really good reasons. Plus the cast is great and worth watching.,1356912000,4,235,4.363636363636363
4330164,2,B004CYF758,"I purchased this because my 2 daughters and I love the show and we thought we might get some secret info for the up coming seasons. The DVD is unwatchable. It jumps, skips, and freezes at least for the first 20 minutes. We just stopped it after the first 20 minutes.",1324512000,4,266,4.235294117647059

8423943,5,B004CYF758,"Terrific 2006 video that I only recently stumbled upon. No wonder TV viewers stayed with HIMYM nine years!  The panel features the show's innovative creators, talented cast and their amazing director Pam Fryman (who created a loving and supportive set where creativity could thrive). Every one of them is smart, charming, articulate and occasionally hilarious. And it doesn't hurt that those five actors are damn good looking.",1482969600,,426,5.358208955223881
8423944,5,B004CYF758,I watched this after watching all 9 seasons of How I Met Your Mother and this was filmed at the start of season two. It was almost uncanny how the writers vision for the show followed through all 9 seasons. How I Met Your Mother is what happens when you have writers and actors who hone their crafts and thoroughly enjoy what they do.,1431216000,2,334,4.234375

8423946,5,B004CYF758,Okay this video is free but I wish that all videos/movies on amazon prime were free like they are on Netflix. Paying per episode is ridiculous.,1417651200,,143,4.538461538461538

8423949,4,B004CYF758,"This presentation which includes interviews with the cast, a discussion with cast about their personal experiences as cast members was followed by a series of questions asked by members of the audience attending this Paleyfest
Discussion.
It was very interesting to hear the cast talk about themselves personally and to see how they learned to play the roles that they played in the series. From the get go it seems that some cast members knew each other from other television series and if not they quickly became friends and then finally became as closely knit as a family. The style of production using many cameras, flashbacks and not presenting everything in chronological order gives this sitcom it's special flavor and has been the basis of its future success since this presentation was filmed after the first season and this series continued on for another eight very successful seasons. This background was entertaining and  informative while
also helping to integrate the story,the production style and the cast of characters so that in the end a person truly got an insightful look at the series.",1398297600,,1108,5.054644808743169
8423950,4,B004CYF758,I <3 the Paley Center sessions. Lots of insight into the minds of the creative talent and cast view points.,1395878400,,107,4.4
8423951,3,B004CYF758,This may be just me but I didn't like the whole atmosphere where they filmed this. Not to mention it was a bit slow paced....,1389830400,,125,4.04
