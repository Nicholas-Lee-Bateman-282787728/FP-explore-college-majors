4098533,4,B0039UU3RI,"Professional bodybuilder and former Vegas lifeguard Gordon Scott took
over the Tarzan role after Lex Barker (who took it over from Johnny
Weissmuller) and in the first few films of his tenure followed the
grunting, mono-syllabic template established by his predecessors.
After a short hiatus doing 'peplum' (gladiator) films in Italy,
producer Sy Weintraub brought Scott back to Tarzan with this
often over-looked gem of the series. Tarzan here is more of a
jungle private detective/fugitive hunter working in conjunction
with local government authorities.  Tarzan was given intelligent
lines to say, real emotions to play, and some class-act bad guys
to confront. Though Scott wasn't looking to convince anyone he was
the greatest actor ever, getting to play opposite future stars like
Sean Connery and Anthony Quayle (already a star on the English stage)
in this film, seemed to bring out the best he had to offer in this
interpretation of Burroughs' jungle hero.  He carried this over into
the follow-up film 'Tarzan the Magnificent'.  Both films have been
released on dvd now via Warner Bros. Archive series and the prints
are quite respectable, though not quite up to more top-of-the-line
restoration standards.",1273104000,4,1216,5.290155440414508

4098535,5,B0039UU3RI,"For the first time since Herman Brix, Tarzan is presented as ERB intended -- educated, intelligent and not the inarticulate ape portrayed by Weissmueller, Buster Crabbe, Lex Barker and Gordon Scott.  With this, the second to the last Tarzan feature with Gordon Scott, he gets to speak intelligent dialogue.  The cast is the strangest feature:  Anthony Quayle (before LAWRENCE OF ARABIA), Sean Connery (before James Bond) and Al Mullock (one armed after Tucco in THE GOOD,THE BAD AND THE UGLY train station killer with Jack Elam and Woody Strode in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST).  Ok, so the last guy is more of a trivia question than anything else.  Tarzan versus poachers who try putting the blame on natives.  An Archives no frills.",1262304000,18,734,4.832
4098536,3,B0039UU3RI,"Fans of Gordon Scott, Sean Connery, and solid action films have been waiting a very long time for this minor classic to appear on DVD. The film is a fast-paced, colorful, robust and exciting jungle story, with some sophisticated dialogue and very adult situations (for the time). The print is clean and bright; cropped slightly to 1:85-1. Warner has released several titles like this no-frills DVD (by popular demand) and the special features are nonexistent, sadly. No commentaries, trailers, etc. and the DVD announces ""This version may not play on computers or non-standard players"". Mine played fine, on three separate DVD players, and the colors appeared saturated and true, though from time to time the matte work makes the shots a bit grainy and soft. Amazon's price is high, but for those of you who have been waiting all this time--well, you know who you are, and might not mind paying the freight, for the pleasure of owning this one. A friend found it for twenty dollars at another vendor, so maybe it's best to shop around before committing to this higher-priced version. Enjoy: the film itself is a delightfully straightforward and often surprising entry in the ""Tarzan"" series, and is considered by fans to be one of the strongest of the ""Tarzan"" films.",1258416000,26,1267,4.925233644859813

4098563,5,B0039UU3RI,"This is the best Tarzan movie ever filmed. I realize there are purists who believe that Johnny Weissmuller was the original and best but I respectfully remind them that the character of the mute savage is not what Edgar Rice intended. And Weissmuller stayed on way beyond his time to create some embarrassing titles.

This 'adult' Tarzan combines the original ethos with a modern sensibility  and enough violence and adventure to satisfy the jaded tastes of those who had to endure later 'epics' like Tarzan and Mermaids which were an unabashed payday for Weissmuller.
Anthony Quayle and Sean Connery as the villains. An adult script and of course Gordon Scott, the underrated Tarzan of the 1960's. Beefy by modern standards, he exuded danger and morality at the same time.
This is a manhunt, pure and simple. It's relatively short time duration makes the script taut and progressive as it moves toward the eventual showdown between Quayle and Scott.
It's 'B' movie entertainment at its best",1377302400,3,991,5.0
4098564,4,B0039UU3RI,"In my opinion this is one of the best Tarzan films.  It has very high production values, a more literate
Tarzan than in previous films, and a stellar supporting cast.  The script has good pacing, and the whole affair
is good escapist entertainment.  I also found the romantic subplot enjoyable, with very good chemistry between the leads.

  I should note that there was a problem with the dvd-r, which did not track near the end of the film. Amazon is sending
a replacement, and was very helpful.  On a more positive note, the transfer was very good, with nice color saturation
and a very crisp image.

  Highly recommended, with the caveat that many of the catalogue films being released by the studios are not being
given the kind of care and attention they deserve. Based on other reviews, it is obvious that there continues to be quality
issues with many of these dvd-r burn-on-demand services.  Hopefully the studios will get their act together- as the consumers
who buy these discs tend to be well informed film lovers that expect to receive a quality product when being charged a premium
price.",1370476800,,1102,4.747368421052632
4098565,4,B0039UU3RI,"I am not well-versed in Taran lore, but this movie was enjoyable.  As most reviews have stated, it's a solid entry among Tarzan films.  Scott Gordon might not be the greatest actor, but as Tarzan his dialog delivery works. (dialog that is modern, not pidgin ""Me, Tarzan"")  Likable despite some flaws - the biggest being Tarzan effectively out of the action for the fourth fifth of the movie while the heroine and villains take center stage.",1365638400,,440,4.7631578947368425

I know these releases don't have any extras, but my only wish and request would be that they include the original movie trailer for the particular film.  I particularly love trailers because they are what would interest one in seeing a film.  Aside from all that, Tarzan's Greatest Adventure and Tarzan the Magnificent are the BEST Tarzan movies ever released.",1364688000,2,517,4.908045977011494
4098577,5,B0039UU3RI,Seeing Sean Connery in the beginning of his carreer is worth having this movie. I think this is the best Tarzan movie in spite of Gordon Scott inexpressive face.,1361750400,,161,4.586206896551724
4098578,5,B0039UU3RI,"I did not expect to track down this particular Gordon Scott Tarzan movie.

I also am impressed with the timely delivery of any products I purchase on-line at Amazon.",1361577600,,313,4.553571428571429
4098579,3,B0039UU3RI,"With the exception of TARZAN'S THREE CHALLENGES
(wherein an emaciated Jock Mahoney took on
Woody Strode in Thailand in a series
of spectacular duels) - and, oh yeah! the first
two Johnny Weissmuller monosyllabic ape man epics
(noteworthy mainly for Jane's astonishing nudity!
- TARZAN THE APE MAN and TARZAN AND HIS MATE),
there's only been one other Tarzan flick worthy
of viewing.

Gordon Scott played the short-haired, tanned jungle
lord somewhat as the literate character author Edgar Rice
Burroughs intended: he actually employed what is called a vocabulary.
In TARZAN'S GREATEST ADVENTURE, Tarz went up
against bad guy Anthony Quayle and after much
business with a wire noose atop a cliff took him down.
Niall MacGuinis (potent as the sorcerer in CURSE OF THE DEMON)
also proved a minor irritant.

But the reason to see this one is the sequence where
Tarz kills Sean Connery who's hunting him through the jungle.  Sean's
a snarly rogue who could easily have played the
film's primary villain; but he certainly earned his chops here
and demonstrated some of the attributes he would soon
bring to 007.

An entertaining curio, a fun flick from 1959.  DVD-R: nice picture clarity.",1361059200,,1182,5.010204081632653
4098580,5,B0039UU3RI,Gordon Scott one the best Tarzans ever. Great cast. This one worth buying you will not be disappointed. I have all the Gordon Scott tarzan movies.,1361059200,,146,4.653846153846154
4098581,5,B0039UU3RI,"Not only was Gordon Scott the best actor for this role ever, this is the best Tarzan movie ever. In my opinion it is the best action adventure movie ever made. This movie is intelligent, visceral, suspenseful, dramatic, sexy and full of action. The direction is superb. The acting and photography are excellent. Special effects are average for a medium budget film of it's time. Sara Shane (a good looking, athletic woman) is perfect as a headstrong woman of the world that learns something valuable here. Anthony Qualye does one of the best villains you will ever see...The final confrontation between ""Slade"" and Tarzan is a fight to the death. Hell of a scene. The rest of Slade's crew are civilized cutthroats, obsessed with money ( in this case diamonds). A young Sean Connery is one of Slade's crew as well.

I saw this movie on the big screen when it first came out in the late fifties. This movie made a huge impression on me, in the way I looked at the natural world and the world of man. I never forgot it. Filmed in Africa...... Kenya, I believe, when filming on location was a big deal. Over a half a century ago there was still a lot of natural wildness there, I'm sure.  This is done so well you can smell the river, the jungle and the sweat and the blood. This is not the typical Tarzan movie. There were only two like this (the other was ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" with Scott).....When Tarzan is blown out of a tree with a stick of dynamite and nearly killed , all the fake buffoonery of past Tarzan movies is forgotten. Like Tarzan says in the film, ""Animals kill for food.....only man kills for the sake of killing.""  Of course Tarzan, a man that lived among the animals in the jungles and forests, was a myth..... but an honorable myth.

A few years back Criterion did a reproduction of ""The Naked Prey"" with Cornel Wilde. They did an excellent job and that is a very good movie. This movie , with Gordon Scott is even better. It deserves the same treatment and maybe one day ....

Movies like this are rarely made anymore. Natural wildness has just about been destroyed and there is little respect for it in popular culture.  There are no animals or primitive men that can stand up to so-called civilized men with their assault weapons and technology. Slade and his kind have won....but the wild things did put up a fight.....",1345161600,3,2344,4.5165094339622645
4098582,5,B0039UU3RI,"This has always been my favorite Tarzan film. Gordon Scott brings an intelligent, aggressive Tarzan to the screen that is probably the closest to any ERB tale. The locale is dead-on, the filming extraordinary. The water falls scenes are stunning. The story hits the ground running and the pace never stops. The cast is outstanding. Gordon Scott as stated above. Anthony Quayle is so intense I feel this
may have been his finest performance. Sean Connery has an early role here, too. Expect excitement, intrigue, double crosses, serious sexual innuendo and one heck of  a ride.",1337385600,,576,5.0

4098585,5,B0039UU3RI,"There is nothing conventional in this film. Take a close look. What you expect to see and hear in a Tarzan film is absent in this one. From Tarzan woken up because he ""smells"" Slade to Tarzan calling a tribe cowards to being rescued by a woman, there is a pervasive tilt to this film that never lets you stand up. A grossly underated film with a wonderful cast. They really don't make em' like this anymore.
A subtle Masterpiece. Not overtly weird like Kiss Me Deadly, but background strange by craftsmen who knew
what decade they were living in.",1316908800,5,546,4.47
4098586,5,B0039UU3RI,"With a beautiful blonde in tow, Tarzan is on the trail of a quintet of devious diamond hunters in Gordon Scott's next-to-last turn as ""The Ape-Man"". Tarzan's Greatest Adventure is arguably just that; and Scott's take, the greatest of any actor. Scott is beefy and brainy. Lethal and literate--closer to the character Edgar Rice Burroughs first created. Gone are Jane and Boy. And Cheetah is a pet, instead of the often distracting comedian of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies.

It's refreshing to see this Tarzan as not King of the Jungle, but merely a part of it. Sure he kills a crocodile, bests a boa, and flicks away a tarantula. But in a key plot twist, Tarzan is badly wounded and must rely on someone for help: ironically, the blonde playgirl Angie (whom he once regarded as baggage).

Overall, the movie is very mature in tone, with sturdy, three-dimensional performances from all the cast (including a young Sean Connery!). Anthony Quayle is exceptional as the scar-faced foe ""Slade"": a complex character with whom Tarzan has tangled before. A man with many passions, but one that underlies them all: ""A passion to kill.""

The only drawbacks are some shoddy blue screen effects and Scott's Hollywood hunk looks that include a slick hair-do and flawless features--both of which would obviously be tattered and battered by the wild African bush!

Those slights aside, Tarzan's Greatest Adventure is a life-and-death struggle 'til the thrilling, bitter end. Every characters' talents are constantly put to the test, thus making its entry the series' best.",1307750400,6,1558,5.0505836575875485
8392417,5,B0039UU3RI,"Can't believe I saw such a ""violent"" movie as a FIVE year old child back in 1959. Of course, there were no age appropriate codes back then. For the last FIFTY NINE YEARS I couldn't remember what movie I had seen. Had a memory of two things from that movie; A quicksand scene and a bad guy in khaki with an Australian hat. In my mind all these years the bad guy was Robert Shaw who never did such a movie. Then, last February, I saw Operation Crossbow again,  with the great Anthony Quayle. Could it be? Bingo! Looking at a photo collage of his movies was a Australian guy with a scar on his face. No doubt now, this was the movie I saw long ago . Another pleasant bonus - a young Sean Connery, another of my favorite actors and the best always James Bond, hands down.

From the start, with the raid on the village in which two people are murdered, the tension never wavers. For once Tarzan has an adversary, Slade (brilliantly played by Anthony Quayle) who does not underestimate him, at least not until the climactic fight on the cliff edge. But as a compromise to fans of the Weissmuller/Barker Tarzan films, the film includes a fight with a crocodile, a skirmish with natives, and a bull-ape cry before and after the fight with Slade.

Slade is leading a gang of adventurers (a pre-Bond Sean Connery, Niall McGinnis, Al Mulock) and his girl Toni played by Scilla Gabel on a quest for diamonds, but it becomes increasingly clear that he has another agenda: He is planning a duel to the death with Tarzan, and the expedition is designed to draw Tarzan on his trail. It is Kreiger (McGinnis) who finally recognizes Slade's passion to kill. One by one the adventurers are eliminated until there is only Slade, waiting on the cliff top with a weapon he has designed for killing Tarzan.
