2440530,3,B000BTH4K4,"While thought provoking and worthwhile, it makes some unfair criticisms about Walmart and fails to point out some of the good things about it.  Walmart forced all of retail to become more efficient, thus lowering prices for consumers.  In small towns it offered stable indoor jobs to people who otherwise had to work in agriculture.  They are very good at adjusting to the needs of their local customers.  The small businesses don't really pay their workers any better than Walmart.  Many of their workers are not looking for a career, just something to do part time for extra money or until something better comes along.  Most security cameras are not manned by live security at any business.  I've known many people who worked their and they speak well of the place.",1434758400,,768,4.816793893129771
2440531,4,B000BTH4K4,"Wal-mart: The High Cost of Low Price is a documentary produced in November of 2005 by Robert Greenwald and Brave New Films. Greenwald and Brave New Films take an extraordinarily biased approach that will make you feel, think, and probably shop differently. If you don't already know or understand whats wrong with Wal-mart, this documentary will without a doubt fill in the blanks. This documentary exposed Wal-Mart's unprincipled business practices through interviews with former employees and executives and small business owners of communities Wal-mart inhabited. The film leaps into the incredibly personal stories and everyday lives of families and communities struggling to fight an invasive giant. A working, single mother is forced to rely on government assistance to provide healthcare for her two children. A Missouri family loses its business after Wal-Mart receives over $2 million to open its doors down the road (Wal-mart). A Chinese woman worker is forced to work in intense heat in Wal-mart factories for minimal pay. A mayor struggles to provide for his first responders after Wal-Mart leaves and relocates just outside the city limits. Hundreds of lawsuits take place each year against the retail giant. There is not one main narrator in this film, but rather countless people we interact with every day in our local hardware stores or family-owned grocery stores, which makes this documentary hit a little closer to home.
Many people don't realize what is happening with Wal-mart and the negative impacts its making, but the numerous narrators bring it to light. Its difficult to not be biased while watching this documentary. Real accounts by real people describe their difficulties and struggles because of Wal-marts actions. For example, the documentary begins in a small town called Middlefield, Ohio. Long established, independently owned stores were nearly destroyed. The Hunter family, who opened H&H Hardware and has run it for many generations, was driven out of business because local people saw Wal-mart as a cheaper and more easily accessible outlet for goods. Wal-mart is a monopoly and no control has been legislated to protect free enterprise in these towns they takeover. Its strategy, supposedly, is to crush the competition (Wal-mart). Millions of dollars in tax abatements are given to Wal-mart to establish itself in a new location, but local owners seeking equal abatements are turned down. Cities are often between a rock and a hard place because if they don't provide Wal-mart with what they want, the company will simply pick up and leave said location leaving the town deserted. When Wal-mart leaves, it takes away key jobs that may not have existed before in the town.

Another outrageous fact surfaced in this film. It examined how the subsidies, or grants, Wal-mart gets from city governments rips away funding from public schools. When Wal-mart opened in Denver, they received $1.7 million in city subsidies (Wal-mart). As a result, the Denver Public Schools system had to shut down three schools. These grants also give Wal-mart an unfair advantage over locally owned shops that provide their workers with better pay and benefits. Not only does Wal-mart pay their workers poorly; they are forced, and even encouraged, to seek out government assistance to provide for their families. This can be seen in the photo above with people protesting for their rights and needs from the massive company. Phenix Montgomery, a former employee of Wal-mart, stated that his manager told him to use your taxpayers dollars to provide for yourself because thats what they're there for. Lee Scott, CEO of Walmart, made $27,207,799 in 2005 when the annual salary of a Wal-mart employee made an astonishing $13,861 (Wal-mart). According to Forbes, the richest people in the world are the six members of the Walton family, owners of Wal-mart (Americas). Collectively, their worth is about $152 billion (Americas).
Wal-mart employs more people than any other company within the United States, including some international countries like China, Bangladesh, and El Salvador. Below is a map of all the Wal-mart locations in just the United States. Many Wal-mart imports are from China. They offer their factory workers dorms to live in that are owned by Wal-mart, but they still have to pay rent. These workers make less than $3.00 a day, go home, pay for whatever food and goods they need to provide their family, and pay rent which goes directly back to Wal-mart (Wal-mart). If they chose to not live in the dorms they are still required to pay rent for the dorms. It just makes no sense whatsoever. Theres almost no point to it, but these workers need the little money than can get to survive. On top of the poor wages, the working conditions are just as formidable.

As many as 31 states have filed lawsuits against the goliath for unfair employee practices, unpaid wages, and discriminatory accusations. Wal-mart is aggressively anti-union. At a minimal threat from unions, as described in the film, three managers were flown by jet immediately to the problem store and identified and fired specific employees pertaining to the nuisance. They would halt employee wages and blame its actions on the unions in the area (Wal-mart). Wal-marts employees, nearly 70% women, have been bombarded by discriminatory remarks from their managerial staff. A $1.6 million lawsuit has been filed against Wal-mart for its discrimination against women (Wal-mart). Different opinions and thoughts can be devised simply by the way a documentary is portrayed.
Throughout this documentary, first hand accounts of experiences of employees, managers, and community members helped shape the biased directive for this film. Having these people narrate this documentary allowed audience to be more drawn in to the subject and be more in-tune to the real story of the film. In my own experience, it allowed me to closely relate a lot more to the people narrating this documentary. The film mostly entailed a narration by these people and also depictions of strikes and commercials that supported the problems these people faced with the Wal-mart Corporation. Being able to see these protests by the employees and fake commercials by this behemoth company gave even more of a reason to dislike it. If there was only one narrator in this film, I feel it would have been a lot more difficult to understand the reasoning behind it. By supplementing it with countless interviews and first-hand accounts, it gave the audience a bigger case against Wal-mart and more evidence of its wrongdoings.

 All in all, as easily seen by this documentary, Wal-mart is not what everyone may think about it. Wal-mart portrays itself in commercials as a stellar employer in employee treatment, community involvement, environmental protection, charitable offerings, and human rights. This is obviously not the case. As presented by these many narrators, Wal-mart is far from what they appear to be. Wal-mart may be beneficial to those who cannot afford higher priced clothes or food, but in the end it is hurting us more than helping. As a massive, hypothetical cycle, we buy, employees work, employees apply for government assistance, taxpayers pay this assistance, and Wal-mart gets richer every year. Wal-mart then proceeds to construct more and more stores, which need more and more employees and the cycle continues. This cycle will always continue so long as Wal-mart has this overwhelming power over these cities and its people.

2440542,5,B000BTH4K4,I just watched this documentary ironicly after a trip to Walmart where I heard employees complaints about working conditions and refusal of overtime!  I couldn't belive that walmart was still treating employees and customers poorly. It's hard to think that the government allows this monopoly yes walmart doesnt own all markets but its has a very small margin of competition.  Like what I learned from Food inc every purchase we vote consumers do have ability to shut down wal mart. But low prices allure low income families and this leads to a company that offers low wage promoting a 2 class system of poor and rich both of which influence walmarts growth.  The next time you shop know you have influence on company growth.  The saftey issues of walmart could be simply solved with paying a few prople to drive around in cheap 2nd hand cars with lights on top which is what I would do if I had a business with a large car park.,1408492800,,929,4.578313253012048

2440548,4,B000BTH4K4,"It's true, it's all true. Everything this documentary alleges is horrifically and terrifyingly true. The company abuses its employees, knowing full well that they have no other options. They keep you on as part time for as long as possible, and even their ""full time"" employees rarely work 40 hours a week, excepting management of course. They also keep your shift irregular to the point that seeking out a second job is nearly impossible. One co-worker asked for a steady shift so that he could return to school, he was fired for his trouble.

I know that Wal-Mart is not the only company that engages in this kind of behavior, but as the largest corporation in the world, I would say they deserve the largest spotlight on their awful policies and actions.

As far as the documentary itself is concerned, it's dry and very low budget. The information is sound, but it loses a star for presentation.",1397174400,,899,4.719745222929936

They run sweat shops in china and elsewhere, and treat their good american employees like slaves and make them do awful things, work off the clock, etc.",1392681600,,364,4.887096774193548
2440551,3,B000BTH4K4,"The documentary makes some good points and provides some good information but seriously overlooks the major issue.  Walmart isn't the main problem, the problem is with the politicians we have elected.  Both Clinton and Bush shipped the jobs of working class people overseas for the benefit of the wall street crowd and other fat cats and wrecked the financial system (Clinton repealed Glass Stegal, and George Bush basically stopped enforcing financial regulations with the banks and wall street. Walmart does some things good and has some faults, particularly with slave wages for their lowest employees, but its not totality heir fault as the government doesn't set a adequate wage for working class people and hasn't done anything about ridiculous runaway medical costs.  Walmart does many things well (disaster relief in Katrina, they were fantastic) and provides good services as a store (its where other stores tell you to go to find stuff).  A federal judge in west virginia described on 60 minutes that you can't blame people for seeking government assistance as our politicians have shipped all the jobs overseas, the supply and demand for the worker in the US is to compete with slave labor in China where there are almost no worker safety or environmental regulations and many people make 3 dollars a day, that it what workers have seen of our politicians view of capitalism.  Don't blame everything on Walmart, they are good and bad like most things, except for our politicians who are primarily bad.",1387497600,,1512,5.056224899598393
2440552,4,B000BTH4K4,"As an employee of Wal-Mart the documentary ""Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Prices"" was a most interesting film to watch. It doesn't pull any punches in is presentations of different stories in how Wal-Mart affects people's lives from employees (both past and present) to owners of small businesses to oversea factory workers to local governments. It shows in these stories that it doesn't matter whether you work for Wally World or not or whether you shop on a daily basis there or avoid Wal-Mart like it is the plague, due to its business practices Wal-Mart invades everyone's life in some way.

This is not an unbias look at Wal-Mart but neither is this a smear campaign either. It is simply tells the story how Wal-Mart through its business dealing and practices has become one of the largest companies today. Wal-Mart is known for its ads saying they have everyday low prices. What this documentary shows is the price everyone else pays for having Wal-Mart in their neighborhood and communities. One of the most interesting stories told is the first one in the film. It looks at a small neighborhood hardware store in a small town in Ohio that had been in business for 40+years. That is until Wal-Mart announced it was going to build a supercenter in that town. Unable to compete against a giant like Wal-Mart what you watch is the death of a small business and a dream.

The segment looking at how Wal-Mart treats its associates is for me interesting since I work for this company. What makes this I think a fair assessment of working conditions there is that they not only interview past employees but current ones as well. Their stories are similar and the frustrations they to through dealing with managers who want the already overworked associates to do even more work and for little pay. It outrages me to watch the part where Wal-Mart managers encourage their workers to go on food stamps and Medicare which in the end becomes a financial strain on society.

There are other issues about Wal-Mart's business practices that is covered in this film. Instead of giving a brief rundown on those stories just go out and get this compelling documentary. Whatever your feelings may be towards Wal-Mart this film is important to see. It will provide a whole new in site to this multi billion dollar company.",1386720000,,2311,4.758104738154613
2440553,5,B000BTH4K4,I slaver over non-fictional videos.  This video reinforces an already-held belief that the USA is in the throes of class warfare and that the common folks are losing the war... badly.,1384646400,,183,4.903225806451613
2440554,5,B000BTH4K4,"The set-up for this documentary is genius.  Segments with the Wal-Mart CEO touting the benefits of Wal-Mart and commercials that are run are refuted with facts, figures, and testimonials.  A must-see for those who think Wal-Mart has saturated American retail.",1381536000,,259,5.45
2440555,1,B000BTH4K4,"I've worked in Bentonville. I've seen what goes on inside the belly of ""the beast."" It is precisely this: Walmart works to make peoples' lives better by saving them money. The customer (as well as the front-line associate) is top-of-mind in the day-to-day operations at corporate.

That being said, whenever power accumulates, there needs to be a check or else it can push the limits. Criticism and opposition are healthy to an extent, and [despite its amateur rough edges and misleading portrayal of the circumstances,] this documentary has probably helped Walmart to tighten up in some places where it has been falling short. But if you buy this hook line and sinker, you prefer flattery to fact.

Some facts to consider:

-Walmart already sources one third of its goods within the U.S.
-Bill Simon, Walmart U.S. CEO, has pledged to increase that by $50 Billion (a huge chunk of the U.S. sales)
-The average Walmart store manager makes $175k annually, and you can become manager within 7 years of an entry level position with only a high-school degree.
-Walmart pioneered the concept of $4 generic prescriptions, simply on the notion that Tic-Tacs and medicine cost roughly the same to manufacture, so why should there be an $80 price difference between them? Once Walmart implemented that program, it was replicated at most major competitors. Walmart led, and the U.S. consumer won.

I want to encourage the makers of this documentary to do a better job next time (unless all they care about is sensationalism that leads to $$$$$). I encourage those who watch this documentary to create a well-informed opinion from unbiased sources.",1379808000,,1636,5.0036764705882355
2440556,1,B000BTH4K4,"This video is a documentary on the ""Eviliness"" of Wal-mart, but in reality it is an indepth look into the level of arrogance, entitlement, and self-serving outrage by former monopoly business owners in small communities and unskilled, minimum wage employees.  Look no further if you want to see why the work ethic and social fabric of America is breaking down on a national scale.

Wake up call - you are not supposed to be able to afford to support a family on a minimum wage job.  That goes doubly so for a single parent household.  Minimum wage is a starting point,  not a destination, for a career.  You want a ""fair share"" of the profits?  Buy stock, unlike most companies Wal-mart actually pays out a decent quartly dividen and as an employee you can buy fractional stock shares through the company with no fees.  (Fractional stock purchases let you buy less than single share amounts allowing for very small purchases making them very affordable.)  Then you too can be an ""evil"" stock share holder taking advantage of the poor workers.  Demanding more pay for nothing is theft pure and simple.

As far as the little towns, do you honestly think all those little ""Mom & Pop"" where paying more than minimum wage and providing lavish health benefit packages to their employees?  No they were not.  On top of that they were charging more for their services too.  Sure the number of better paying jobs in the towns dropped for a small number of people, but the prices for goods and services plummeted once the monopoly these buisness owners once enjoyed were broken.

Get a basic education in math and economics and you'll understand that this video, and many like it, is nothing more than emotional pro-socialist, pro-labor drivel.",1379116800,,2052,4.700280112044818

Two of the five riches American women are Waltons, i.e. Wal-Mart stockholders. I lived in San Jose, CA when they got tax abatment from the city.  Land values decreased and the whole bit.  Problem now is that I have moved to the California Foothills and the only source for a lot of our staples and everyday needs can only be obtained from Wal-Mart.  They hire folks for 28-29 hour weeks so they get no benefits, pay them minimum wages, etc.  Too bad there is no competition available. Too bad that all the local independent store owners have gone out of business.  As I am 80 years old, I probably won't see their workers form a union, but that is really what the employees need.

IMO, Walmart isn't the only culprit when it comes to exploiting the government and their employees, there's plenty of that going on everywhere in the United States. Walmart is just one of many companies who engages in these despicable practices. But on the flip side of the argument, there may be a lot of positive stimuli on some level to the economy brought to fruition through Walmart, so, who knows?

2440560,1,B000BTH4K4,"This movie is highly opinionated and biased...

Walmart doesn't buy any more percentage of products from foreign companies than any other large merchandiser.

Also note that Walmart buys their food items from strictly American suppliers.  But they don't tell you that in this documentary....They also don't tell you that Walmart is the largest employer of American workers in this country.

The screwed up economic balance of the working class, is a large reason why Walmart has to buy products from foreign markets.  American manufacturers are to high priced.  The only people who can afford to buy American made goods are Union wage employees.  They earn considerably more than their non union counterparts, for soing the same exat job....and they get much better benefits to boot.

This documentary is nothing more than sourgrapes inspired by Walmarts competitors.  It is a tool desined to brainwash people against Walmart, so the greedy American Walmart copetition can extinguish Walmart in order to gain control of the market.

Walmart employees earn the same rate of pay as the other stores doing the same type of business (ie.  Kmart, Target, Costco, Meijer).  While I agree that Walmart emloyees are underpaid.....soare all the other employees in that type of industry...to include food stores and any retail sales business.  Walmart is the largest chain inthe world, no wonder they are the target of their vast competition.  What we need is the gov't to regulate wages for ALL employees...and start monitoring the wages of our countries politicians, CEO's and high profile figures.

Wake up America.......if you are part of the vast majority NOT earning union wages....You need Walmart to keep your head above water. Boycotting Walmart is just giving your greedy Capitalists a green light to raise their prices with no opposition.

It also made me aware that purchases based solely on low price is not always in my best interest in the long-run.

It is a shame that one of the richest companies in the United States (if not the world) can pay its employees so poorly that they cannot afford adequate food and medical care, then turn around and recommend that they get on ""welfare"" and seek the help of charities to make ends meet.

I would recommend the DVD to anyone, regardless of their political or economic views, to watch the DVD and then ask whether Wal-Mart and other major retail corporations are acting with the best interest of the American people in mind.",1372204800,,821,4.609589041095891

I watched the movie with an open-mind, had no idea what the ""big deal"" about Walmart was.  A lot of big companies pull underhanded practices, so I couldn't see what could possibly be so bad about this one.  I found that I was wrong.  After watching this movie, I immediately ceased any Walmart shopping.  The way this company destroys communities is mind-boggling.  Entire (small) towns are practically shut down, as the small mom & pop shops are forced out of business because WalMart can sell everything cheaper by exploiting cheap overseas labor and strong-arming their suppliers due to their huge volume purchases.  This kills the livelihood of the owners of the stores.  The workers at the stores can hope to get a job at WalMart, but forget about getting health care or other benefits because you won't get enough hours to qualify.  And even if you work enough hours, your manager may be told to reduce the number of hours on your timecard, so you may not get paid for it.  It's gross and disgusting.

Oh, and ""lots of big companies"" are like that?  Check out Costco.  They start their workers ABOVE minimum wage, WITH benefits.  Target, another big retailer, doesn't even have the rap sheet of the WalMart monster.

The most heartbreaking part for me was the look into the Wal-Mart suppliers all around the world. Like China, where employees work incredibly long hours for incredibly low pay, under terrible conditions. When the Wal-Mart ""inspectors"" come to review the working conditions, they send word in advance so that the managers can brief people in what to say (or more significantly, what not to say), and they can clean up the place and let the inspectors take home a satisfactory report.

The film points out that Wal-Mart gets huge government subsidies in a variety of ways. One way is to direct their employees to government services such as medicaid and WIC for which they are eligible because their income is so low. Their techniques for quashing any attempt at union organizing are detailed. Irony abounds: in a segment on safety in the parking lot, one store where a woman was abducted had the abduction on film, even though there was no one watching the security cameras. They had been installed to record union organizing activity in the parking lot so as to identify and eliminate employees who talked to union organizers.

You'd think the number of lawsuits against the company might tell them something, but apparently it is more cost-effective to pay off when necessary rather than to correct their practices.

The good news is that the film ends on a positive note, showing how many communities have managed to keep Wal-Mart out of their area. Yes, it takes organizing and fighting, but it can be done.",1336694400,,1767,4.783606557377049

Shows American Walmart employees unable to pay for food, rent, health care on their wages.

Also shows Walmart's failure to secure parking lots and the extremely high crime rate in their lots (car jackings, shootings, rapes...).

Well, for my family most of these business'  owners stories are much like my own family's. My parents owned 3 bicycle stores in 3 different towns.  Each town had a WalMart, but they were closed on Sunday were very very small.  Within a year, each town started building a SuperWalmart.  Within 6 months of completion, we lost everything. My father could not compete when WM sold cheaper products and well below their own costs.  My parents filed bankruptcy and along with that our college funds were taken. My parents were on the accounts, therefore the funds went into the bankruptcy.

WM kills small towns. Our downtown area is nothing whereas it used to house many varieties of stores. It was a place people strolled around with families on a sunny afternoon. No longer. The downtown is gray, old, dilapidated.

You can not tell me WM didn't know what they were doing. Within a couple months of a specialty store (bikes, aquatics, grocery, shoes, etc) going out of business, WM raised their prices.

2440600,2,B000BTH4K4,"Reality check: Getting rid of Walmart will not solve anything.

Things will get much MUCH worse for quite a long time before they start to get better. Does anyone have the patience or the selflessness to make life harder on themselves and their loved ones? Are people willing to make their families starve or eat less for several years to bring back small businesses where they would have to pay a higher price for something that isn't worth paying more for? And how long will it take for jobs to come back? - to fill up the jobs lost by all the Walmarts that were shut down. How long will it take for most Americans to be employed again? How long will it take for things to get noticeably better?

Too long.

And it would be even harder if other businesses similar to Walmart were shut down. Home Depot maybe. Definitely McDonalds.

It's always darkest before the dawn. Maybe everything will improve, but we're already in a recession/depression. Who is really willing to make a sacrifice on a bet? Will things truly get better? There's no promise of this.

Places like Walmart allow families that can hardly pay for rent, much less clothes and food, to make some type of living. It allows them to keep their children from starving. It allows them to occasionally give their children a gift - something to brighten their otherwise dark childhood. For some people, it's a highER cost to stop going to Walmart.

Side Note: What I hate about reviewers here is that people who give this movie 1 or 2 stars are accused of being ""paid by Walmart"" to write in a good word. That's not always the case. This movie was incredibly biased. Sure, the pros are scary to list because most people know them and it might be overly contradicting to their objective. But take any college English course that teaches argument and persuasion. You're supposed to present both sides of the argument. Typically those who don't do not have a found argument. Usually there are a lot of holes in their position that they're afraid of their audience discovering.

I gave this movie 2 stars because ""I didn't like it.""  Why? I don't like people shoving a point down my throat. You know what I mean. Like when overly religious people shove their point down my throat and insist that I will burn in hell if I don't do what they say. Yep. This was a close equivalent - to me at least.

I love the vast selection of products and the prices, but I hate the parking, the crowds, the long checkout lines, etc. Never-the-less, I pressed play with an open mind, and viewed the entire documentary. Afterwards, I felt like the entire issue boiled down to apples or oranges. In other words, you can look at it from both sides, but in the end, I will continue to shop at Walmart.

Look, I also live in a small town. In fact, there's a Walmart supercenter around the corner from my house. But, none of the businesses in or around it have suffered. In fact, they've increased by 200%. If you're familiar with Millington, Tenn, then you know this to be a fact! The once small and only hardware store a few doors down from Walmart, on Hwy 51 did not close, but actually expanded. Lowes even built a supercenter across the street.

So, as for the documentary, I'm really not feeling it. This is my perspective as a consumer. I'm sure both sides of the argument have substance. But the question is whether or not the good outweighs the bad.

I think the American public would have been better served if the producers of this film tackled a hard-hitting documentary that focuses on either of the following:

1. The Military Industrial Complex
2. The Central Banking System and/or I.R.S.
3. The big oil industry
4. Insurance and Pharmaceutical companies.

I'm sure any of you can add few more to the list. In my opinion, those listed above are the real boogie-man...............not Walmart.",1281657600,,1565,4.676363636363637
2440624,1,B000BTH4K4,"In business school, Walmart is one of the companies that we frequently have to analyze.  There are many things that ARE true about the company.  It IS the biggest company in the world.  It IS bigger than pretty much all competitors combined.

However, this movie gives almost no FACTUAL information, instead pushing a clearly biased agenda.  Having studied for almost 100 hours the balance sheets, business practices, legal claims, strategy, and everything else involved in Walmart, I can easily say that this isn't true.

In the average town where Walmart enters, there is a net benefit of about 50 new jobs.  (100 new jobs are created at Walmart, and 50 are lost at other stores.)  Walmart pays new employees a dollar or more above minimum wage, and payraises are built in on a yearly basis, as well as additional raises for good ideas and performance.  The healthcare plan is open not only to fulltime but parttime employees at a price significantly less than most companies, including, very likely, the one you work for.  The average family saves over $4000 a year by shopping at Walmart, both in direct savings and in competitive savings.  (Do YOU want to give up your savings?)  Walmart achieves these savings not by taking advantage of suppliers, but by working WITH them.  In fact, Walmart has consistently been named one of the best retailers to supply to in Fortune magazine because they see all relationships as win-win.

Walmart started out as a small, family business just like the ones profiled in this movie.  It got bigger and bigger because they consistently sought to add value for their stakeholders by delivering higher quality at lower prices.  Taking a few vignettes of dissatisfied people and turning that into a movie says nothing.  EVERY company has a pissed off employee.  The company YOU are working at right now has some disgruntled employee who I could go interview in order to 'expose' your evil employer.  Rather than listen to rhetoric, though, listen to facts.

Walmart is currently the global leader in creating environmentally stores.  They are pushing to purchase local produce because it is cheaper to ship and fresher for the customer.  Please do your homework before buying propaganda put out without factual basis, and read the other reviews that point out the outright LIES in this film.  (Like the fact that H&H hardware went out of business 3 months before Walmart even opened.)

Any statistics that were presented were given as absolute numbers, so it was impossible to tell how significant a particular issue was.  There were many logical fallacies presented in which Wal-Mart was held responsible for problems that they did not directly contribute to.  Some legitimate points were made, but the film failed to make any case other than that Wal-Mart is guilty of being a large corporation looking out for its bottom line.

Although I always knew I wasn't a fan of Wal-Mart, today I learned I'm even less of a fan of crappy documentaries about Wal-Mart.",1267228800,,721,5.128205128205129
2440627,4,B000BTH4K4,"While there are a few blunders made by the creators of this film (i.e. H&H actually closing before the Wal-Mart even opened), I whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone.

Think back to your own Wal-Mart shopping experiences...have you ever seen a happy Wal-Mart associate outside of a Wal-Mart commercial?

As a public school teacher, the portion about government subsidies and money being taken away from schools (potentially, it could have gone to other local commerce endeavors) and given to Wal-Mart just made me ill.  Upon reading other reviews, I agree that this is also an indication of flaws within government.  However, when you have pockets as deep as the Waltons, you're probably able to grease the wheels in several jurisdictions.

The most telling of all were the former Wal-Mart managers.  Granted, we don't officially know why they are no longer working for the corporation, but so many willing to speak up seemed a bit odd.

Finally, this film was released in 2005/2006.  With it now being 2010 I'd love to see if these figures are even higher.

2440630,4,B000BTH4K4,"I had heard a lot of bad stories regarding Wal-Mart even before watching this film so I wasn't really shocked by a lot of the information contained in this film. For example I have known for quite some time that Wal-Mart shuns American made products and that commercial property values plummet when Wal-Mart makes its public that they will be building a store in a particular community. I was also aware of the low wages and the keeping employees at part time so they cant qualify for certain benefits like medical insurance. With that being said I was still in a state of disgust and disbelief after watching this film.

Wal-Mart is basically the epitome of the evil corporation who puts profits over EVERYTHING else including the well being of their employees and the safety of their customers. While this film is not perfect in the presentation of its argument, it does a good enough job for people to get the point and that point is that Wal-Mart is greedy, negligent, tyrannical, exploitative, and corrupt and will do whatever it can to increase profits. This is a corporation that cares only about one thing and one thing only and that is its bottom line sales wise.

The US government is supposed to stop monopolies from existing yet everywhere we look today we see mega corporations who absolutely dominate their respective markets. Wal-Mart is the very essence of a monopoly as not only do they dominate their respective market, they also try and squash any competition that exists even if its some small family owned store that poses no threat whatsoever to Wal-Marts total sales. The fact that this is a company that basically refuses to sell American made products just makes our governments non involvement that much more pathetic.

I for one have NEVER shopped at Wal-Mart. That's right, I have never spent a single penny in a Wal-Mart store. I have been inside a Wal-Mart a couple of times but I myself have never purchased anything. Initially my not shopping at Wal-Mart had absolutely nothing to do with any of this, it was simply a store that I had no interest in whatsoever. Now that I understand Wal-Marts true nature, I won't even step foot in a Wal-Mart store. I don't care if they start selling HDTV's for 1 penny each. I am proud of the fact that I have never shopped there and that is something that I will stand by until the day I die or at the very least until they implement some very serious changes to their way of practicing business. My entire family now actively seeks out American made products and we also make it a point to give at least some of our business to the ""smaller companies"" out there. That may sound disingenuous coming from someone who shops at Amazon but its 100% true. Besides, Amazon employs a system that actually helps some of the smaller companies out there as lets face it, some of them would not exist at all if it weren't for Amazon Marketplace.

I wound up giving this film a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating simply because this film gets a little sloppy at times in regards to its presentation of data, or in some cases its lack of data. With that being said this documentary does a great job getting its overall message across and ultimately its a film that every single American should see.

The Bottom line - People really need to start taking an active interest in who they are giving their money too. Price simply cannot be the bottom line as there are far more important issues at stake here than just saving a few extra dollars. If people actually took the time to learn whats behind those cheap prices, I have no doubt that a very large percentage of those people would never come back. Wal-Mart is a company that basically stands opposed to the very idea of a free market. In fact certain aspects of Wal-Marts business practices are nothing short of criminal and the fact that the US justice dept hasn't gotten involved yet is a testament to just how much lobbying power Wal-Mart has and just how corrupt our own government has become.

Watch this film and just say no to Wal-Mart!

4 Stars!!",1259884800,,4069,4.581043956043956
2440631,1,B000BTH4K4,"This review retreads many of the same points that I have seen other reviewers already make, and which I whole-heartedly agree with.  It is too easy for people to be duped by the selective half-truths (and even lies) presented by films like these, and this film needs more 1-star reviews to help get the word out.
1. Statistics are presented without context.  For example: Walmart employees on public assistance (including but perhaps not limited to Medicaid and state equivalent programs): 4,000 in the state of Alabama - but is that 0.25% of Walmart employees or 95% of Walmart employees?  0.25% would point to a problem with individual employees, 95% would point to a problem with Walmart's compensation practices.  And that seems like such an obvious thing to point out in making an argument against Walmart, that since the filmmakers did not point it out, it actually achieves the opposite effect and leads me to conclude that the percentage must be very small.  Even so, how does that compare to other big box stores like Home Depot, Best Buy, Target, Kmart, and Sears?  As others pointed out, how many would be on welfare in addition to government health programs if not working at Walmart?
2. The film literally accuses Walmart for raping women in its parking lots.  When you boil down the films argument to a clear sentence, the absurdity becomes clear.  What is insidious about the film is that it is so easy to accept the segment about the rape, because the little things are easy to agree with: people SHOULD be watching security cameras that are in the parking lot, human life IS more important than preventing shoplifting, and so the disparity between cameras inside the store and outside the store DOES seem grossly unfortunate in this circumstance - but when you take a step back and look at the claim, you realize that this unfortunate situation could happen (and has) in any parking lot, and there is nothing about Walmart's practices or existence in particular that made this rape happen, and if there is, the film failed to establish the connection.  To summarize and repeat - this film accuses Walmart of causing the rape of a woman.  How can you give any credence to a film that does this without even trying to present any evidence?
3. The film tries to establish that Walmart working conditions in China are terrible.  And they are.  But the film interviews a Chinese woman who explains that it is the best job she can get.  So Walmart actually provides the best jobs in China, according to their interviewee, even if they are terrible by our standards.  That damages the films point, and its credibility, since it was presented as an anti-walmart argument.  At least the filmmakers were honest enough not to cut that comment or mistranslate it.
4. There is no time, not even lip service, not even a call to action, given to the point that CONSUMERS who shop at walmart are to blame for any problems that Walmart perpetrates.  The South Park episode on Walmart actually achieves better at this then does this film.  Ironically, it does show commercials from the old days when Walmart took pride in ""Made in the USA"", but rather than pointing out that consumers by their purchasing actions drove Walmart away from that patriotic pride to Chinese manufacturing, the film instead disingenuously uses those commercials to make it seem like Walmart was lying about ""Made in the USA"".
5. The film discusses the local government failures, but puts the blame on Walmart instead of the local government or the people who elected them.  Including the $10,000 bribe to a local government official in Minnesota to overlook out-of-code signage.  (Keep watching through the credits to see that)
6. Healthcare - why must Walmart provide full healthcare coverage but not ma and pa hardware stores?
7. H&H Hardware - it turns out that H&H hardware closed three months before Walmart opened, that no other businesses in Middlefield, OH actually closed after Walmart opened, and that the hardware store was bought by a new owner, after Walmart opened, who turned it into a thriving business.  So - the film just plain lies to us to make a point.  That's just plain despicable.
This is a bad movie.  Watch it with eyes wide open and make it your duty to help your friends understand why they must be skeptical about this films claims.",1259366400,,4337,4.801075268817204

Reluctantly, I ventured in.  I was AMAZED.  Here was this entire department store, in the middle of nowhere, with clothes and tools and food all scattered willy-nilly everywhere with no salespeople anywhere in sight.  It reminded me of Goodwill but with price tags.  I found a shirt that would look okay on camera and paid $5.97 for it.  So what if it was made in China by virtual slave labor?  The bored clerk rang up the sale and I was back in my hotel room by 8:15.

2440649,5,B000BTH4K4,"Watch this movie and you will see why we need to pass the Employee Free Choice Act!
There is more at stake than most people realize. Big business is prepared to spend $200 million to mislead us, block the Employee Free Choice Act and stop us as employees from being organized in the workplace. BUT realize this; The real goal is to keep us unorganized as citizens, the stewards of our own government.

It is our responsibility as US Citizens to fight the corporate greed which has left our economy in ruins. What can we do? Spread the word and join together in contacting your congressmen and senators. The CEO's and the Financial Elite DO NOT WANT THE PEOPLE UNITED and they will oppose any attempts by the people to unite against them. The CEO's and the ""Financial Elite"" are preparing to spend $200 Million in advertisement and marketing to deceive you into voting the way they want you (and your congressional representatives) to vote...again! Being informed, you will be able recognize the coming campaign of deception when you see it.

The ""Employee Free Choice Act"" will allow employees the ability to join together in union against the CEO's and the Financial Elite. It will allow employees to join or form a union when a majority of employees sign a card requesting a union (majority sign-up). However, if 30% of the employees wish to have a secret ballot vote, the employees will then have secret ballot vote to decide if they wish to have a union.
Currently it is the employer who chooses if the employees shall be able to join or form a union by majority sign-up or by a secret ballot election...and almost every single employer demands an election and they like it that way!

Why? After a majority of employees sign a card requesting a union, the employer then demands an election. It takes at least 45 days until the election is held and in that time the employers hire anti-union consultants to train their supervisors who then intimidate, harass, coerce and even fire the employees who try to join together. Many corporations keep an anti-union team which can be flown out in a moments notice to crush an organizing drive.
After being threatened, the remaining employees then decide (Surprise!) that it is not a good idea to join together.

The ""Employee Free Choice Act"" DOES NOT TAKE AWAY AN EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO A SECRET BALLOT VOTE! $200 million will be spent by the CEO's and the Financial Elite to convince you that it does...but now you know the truth. The Employee Free Choice Act does take away the absolute power the employers have over the employees during an election because the employers can no longer demand an election. The employees can still demand an election at any time!

The CEO's will tell you that they only want to protect the employees right to a vote... Really? Were they protecting your rights when they deregulated the financial markets and then hid what they were up to (the sub-prime mortgage mess, CDO's Collateralized Debt Obligations and CDS's Credit Default Swaps)? Visit our website [...] for an explanation of the Sub-Prime banking mess! Were they protecting your rights when they took your pension money and then used it to `sell you' the company in an ESOP so the shareholders, Officers and board of directors could take your money and leave you the debt? Gee, I wonder why the Tribune has written articles against the Employee Free Choice Act?
Were they protecting your rights when they took away defined benefit pensions and replaced them with 401K's (Now 201K'S)? Were they protecting your rights when they shipped your job out of the USA? Were they protecting your rights when they cut your wages? Were they protecting your rights when they fired you or your coworker when they spoke out against an unfair practice? Were they protecting your rights when they made you part time and then took away your benefits? Were they protecting your rights when they fired you so they could hire someone else at half your wages? Were they protecting your rights when they took outrageous salaries (up to 500 times what the `floor worker' makes) and huge bonuses as their companies go bankrupt?

Do you really believe that the CEO's and the financial elite would spend $200 million to protect ""your"" rights?

Our vote and our voice are more powerful than their money. Do not be fooled again!

After the first documentary, I stopped shopping at Wal-Mart. I really enjoyed shopping at Sam's, though, and rationalized continuing to shop there.

Although nobody starts such a documentary without an agenda, in this case it's shamelessly obvious. A great deal of people are interviewed but they unanimously have nasty things to say about Walmart. Other than a few headline-news statistics, this is all hearsay; not backed by anything except the word of mostly disenfranchised ex-employees.

The only pro-walmart people to speak are of the CEO via news clips taken from the him speaking in interviews or other speeches.

Of course, there's the cliche of the downsized town (no mention of those in the town who really appreciate the new Walmart), ex-employees talking about sexual harassment or racism (as if no other business suffers from such things), etc. ad tedium.

Nothing new to learn here. I do feel sorry for people who lack such objectivity that they'd easily be sold to this documentary's agenda, though.

I expected them to say, ""Yes, we are a ruthless, souless, corporation driven simply by pure greed, our neverending mission being to open more and more stores around the globe while destroying all competition and increasing profits forever and ever until the return of Jesus. Amen"". You know what? I would at least respect that answer. It might actually work. But of coarse what they ended up doing was creating a public relations ""war room"" (-their term. Btw, ""public relations"" replaced the term ""propaganda"" to describe the exact same practices after the latter term became so tainted as to no longer be usable.)in late 2005 specificly to discredit this fair and objective -but passionate- critic of their business practices. On the same day as the release of THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE Wal-Mart released a DVD film defending its practices entitled WHY WAL-MART WORKS; AND WHY THAT DRIVES SOME PEOPLE C-R-A-Z-Y (""Crazy"" already written in all caps with hyphens). A very funny and highly ironic incedent latter occured with the director of the pro-Wal-Mart propaganda, Ron Galloway. Galloway publicly criticised Wal-Mart for it's disgusting labor practices stating, ""They just instituted a wage cap for long-term employees--people making between thirteen and eighteen dollars an hour. It's a form of accelerated attrition. They can't expect me to defend that."" Heh, well you just gotta love that one.

This is an important film because Wal-Mart is the biggest public corporation by revenue in the entire world, the biggest private employer in the world, and the fourth biggest utility employer. They are also now the biggest grocery store in America and the biggest toy seller. They also run and own Sam's Club. So, it is only the right thing to do as a consumer AND a citizen to give a fair hearing to the critics and their arguments.

How much scrutiny has the world's biggest corporation received by our major media institutions? We have heard much more from Wal-Mart in their ubiquitous TV advertisements and cheerful right-wing pundits on the wonderful benefits to America and the world of Wal-Mart's business model.

Shame on the government for subsidizing them.

The documentary makes good points and Wal Mart does put some small family owned businesses out of business however this movie is extremely one sided and unfair to Wal Mart.  Just because a bigger business puts a smaller one out does not make it inherently evil.  We live in a capitalistic society.  If you provide a signifigantly better product consumers will shop at your store.  if you don't they are going to shop at Wal Mart to get a significantly better price.  I feel the movie should have tried to get some unbiased consumer opinions about Wal Mart.  Not everyone can hate Wal Mart considering its sales account for a signifigant percentage of this nations GDP.  I enjoy documentaries and for that reason I still did find enjoyment in a completely one sided documentary.

2440721,4,B000BTH4K4,"I admit that I have shopped at Wal-mart in the past, saving a few dollars here and there.  Now I no longer can in good conscience.  I can hardly blame Wal-mart for all of the problems of corporate America, but this company does set a precedence for business practices.  This movie is admittedly biased, and I try not to take any one source at face value without further investigation.  However, this scathing documentary does seem consistent with the chronic exposes about Wal-mart in the daily papers and evening news.

When I heard the young Chinese woman and her boyfriend complain about the long working hours and mandatory dormitory (whether workers choose to live in the factory dormitories or not, payment for rent is automatically deducted from their paychecks), I kept thinking to myself that these young people belong in graduate school, not slaving over cheaply manufactured exports.  Wal-mart and other corporations definitely take advantage of workers in third-world countries. And in our own country, we see that Wal-mart can become a modern day ""company store,"" preying on single mothers for their dual roles as employees and consumers. (What little of their paycheck remains goes back to Wal-mart for groceries and supplies.)

Lee Scott seems to be a very self-deceived man.  You can twist any situation around and end up describing it as exactly the opposite of what it is in reality, while convincing yourself and others that ""bad is good and good is bad.""  Lee seems to rationalize the corporation's business practices because Wal-mart provides cheap prices for working families; therefore, he's doing his part for America and the economy.  But what sort of corporation would actively encourage its employees to seek Medicaid and W.I.C. in order to avoid providing health care (with affordable co-pays and deductibles) and a living wage?  (Lest I be misunderstood, there is no shame in seeking governmental services and subsidies, and I'm glad that such programs are available to those who need them.) The word ""union"" is considered an obscenity and omnipresent threat for Wal-mart executives.

Safety in Wal-mart parking lots has been an issue.  What's the point of having cameras at every angle if no one is there to observe them?  With Wal-mart's astronomical profits, it is well within the budget to provide stores with effective security.  Wal-mart also had a tacit (or not so tacit) policy of pressuring employees to work overtime without pay (or if they are given credit for extra hours, it will be tallied on the next time sheet to avoid paying overtime).  Now whether every district manager enforces this exploitative practice is another matter, but this is still disturbing.

This documentary was one-sided (when it showed Wal-mart's promotional videos, spokespersons, and commercials, Wal-mart's claims would be contradicted (to the point of being farcical) by statistics or anecdotes in the following scenes), but I don't think the worst of the complaints are much of a stretch.

In the spirit of Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me), this movie elucidates the high cost of cutting corners and taking advantage of people. In the final analysis, the economics of doing it right the first time (that is, ethical business practices) are comparable to all the fines, lawsuits, and sullied reputations of doing it the wrong way.",1199232000,,3348,5.145756457564576
2440722,5,B000BTH4K4,"This is a frightening documentary along the lines of Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room and Morgan Spurlock's ""Super Size Me"".  Wal-Mart is portrayed as a great destroyer of human lives.  Some examples:

- Women are systemically excluded from management roles - and told so to their faces.  Employees receive and report racist slurs, that managers ignore.

- Palletized bags of fertilizer are stored on parking lot grounds where the rain carries the chemicals into local drinking water.  Complaints to Wal*Mart headquarters are ignored until the practices are reported on the evening news.

- Managers illegally alter worker hours to erase overtime pay.

- Managers coerce unpaid overtime from employees by inferring they'll be fired and if they don't go along.

- Union buster hit squads are deployed from Wal*Mart headquarters by corporate jet at the first hint of unionization activity.  Suspected leaders are followed through the store to observe who they associate with.

- Managers distribute information on Medicaid and food stamp programs to employees because benefits are below subsistence.  (Our tax dollars subsidizing Wal*Mart.)

- Municipalities grant Wal*Mart tax abatements and building subsidies to open within municipal limits, because the alternative is Wal*Mart opens outside city limits and the municipality receives no tax receipts.  Wal*Mart opens, and scores of mom-and-pop businesses fail.  Several years later, when the property tax abatements expire, Wal*Mart closes the store and re-locates 2 miles outside city limits, leaving a ghost town behind.

Like Super Size Me and The Smartest Guys in the Room, this film is about corporate leadership and values.  The vacuum of responsible leadership in Wal*Mart's case - at least as portrayed in this movie - is chilling and disgraceful.

If Super Size me made you think twice about your next Big Mac, this film will give you similar reservations about purchasing from Wal*Mart.  It's a must-see.",1198886400,,1969,5.355048859934853

Their prices are impeccable and they offer job opportunities to young people getting through high school and college.  Now the argument of some will be that Wal-Mart is doing what any other retailer does to make a profit, paying low wages to beat the bottom line, outsourcing manufacturing to beat the bottom line, discriminating against minorities to beat the bottom line...hmm...this is not a corporation I would like to support.  And for the record, $3/day is a slave wage in today's time, no matter where you reside.  China should be ashamed of itself for allowing this corporation to come in and give it to its population with no vaseline.  At some point, big business has to take a moral and ethical stance, and we as consumers have to force this stance and make 'big businesses' accountable.  I am no longer a Wal-Mart Shopper.

Probably because he can't dispute the cold hard facts and statistics that these types of documentary's reveal.

The amount of greed associated with Walmart completely boggles my mind. I've seen it first hand here in my city, they build one supercenter, and just a few miles down the road they build another. WHAT'S THE POINT? Is the 30 billion dollars a year not enough?

And the Wholesome All-American image Walmart portrays in the media and television is just icing on the cake.",1194912000,,722,4.722222222222222
2440741,1,B000BTH4K4,"I don't why I waste my time watching these supposed documentaries that are so predictable based solely on their title.  This one is no different, however, this supposed documentary was just a terrible attempt at spreading propaganda.  The editing, the interviews, and the half-baked facts they presented were terribly done and not convincing whatsoever.

What this film producer failed to point out is that Walmart is a corporation that is in the business of making money for themselves and for their stock holders.  They are not in the business to provide socialized medicine for all of America.  Since when has any retail store provided great paying jobs with health benefits so that the average employee could support a middle class family?  Retail jobs are a good for; 1) to supplement a family's income and 2) to provide entry level jobs for people with no work experience who are trying to better themselves.  Just like thousands of other people, I put myself thru college working various low paying retail jobs and the experience obtained in the retail industry (along with my education) help me better myself to enter the business world.

Walmart is so successful because they save consumers so much money and give back to the communities they are in.  All of the Walmart haters should walk thru one of their stores and be observant.  They carry the same brands that Kroger,Target, and Home Depot have and they sell them a lot cheaper.  Unfortunately, a lot of our original US based brands are now made overseas.

Unfortunately, the American consumer has forced most of our manufacturing base out of the country.  The east and left coast consumers are the worst.  They pass laws to keep Walmart out of their communities and then the consumers on the coasts are the largest buyers of foreign made cars.  America's auto industry is one of the last major manufacturers left in the USA.  The US auto companies are the largest private providers of health care in the world and they provide strong middle class wage to their workers.  The US auto market share is down to about 50% in the US, however, on the Walmart hating coasts, the US Auto market share is around 20%.  The big three automakers have had to slash 100's of thousands of their jobs from their workforce as American consumers have quenched their thirst for foreign products.  I think its time for the hypocrites to look in the mirror because it isn't Walmart ruining this country, it's the large group of ill informed hypocitic American consumers (concentrated on the east and left coast) who talk out of one side of their mouth abouting hating Walmart, as they drive around in their foreign cars. It becomes quite obvious that the Walmart haters not only dislike American companies that sell some foreign products, they also hate American companies that sell American products!",1193961600,,2845,4.877338877338877
2440742,5,B000BTH4K4,"This was a powerful documentary, even though you could tell by the title that it's obviously anti wal-mart.  I didn't have a problem with that, because I myself am anti wal-mart.  I used to believe in that chain, loved the way Sam Walton went from store to store in every town, flying his own small plane and dressed in jeans and flannel.  He knew exactly what was going on in every store down to the piddliest details like uniform costs, and other minor details.  I loved the way he would go out of his way to put US made products on his shelves, and he built a giant on the premise of low prices/US goods.  Well he must be spinnin in his grave now, looking down on his what his spoiled kids have done to that chain.  Putting their bottom line ahead of our national security, selling out to the Chinese.  Now I know that it's harder and harder to find any goods that aren't made in China, but at least the other big chains didn't build their business on touting US made goods, and then turn around and stick it to American companies and their goods.  How long is going to take this apathetic country of ours to realize that if this continues to go on, eventually we won't manufacture anything anymore.  At that point we will be done as a powerful nation, because we will be fully dependent on, and beholden to the Chinese.  Which is exactly what they want.  All we'll have to do is piss them off, and they could impose a trade embargo that could cripple this nation.  This is what the film fails to lead to.  That at this very moment, China could leave every single wal-mart (as well as most other stores) as bare as a baby's butt.  What do you think is going to happen to soccer mom when she can't get anything at the store?  When all the soccer moms start fighting and rioting over the last of anything.  Which is why wal-mart getting into the grocery business really, really scares me.  What will happen when a corporation controls all the food and clothing you need, and is in bed with an enemy of the US?  When China can control us at that level we are doomed.  If you think you are improving you children's lives by buying everything at wal-mart's low prices, think again.  Every dollar you spend there is a dollar towards the decimation of their future.  Hopefully this film can open enough eyes to prevent this anti-American, subversive, greedy Walton family from selling our country out from under us lock, stock, and barrel.  I share it and tell everyone who'll listen all about this film.  To me, it's about saving this country before it's too late.  Thanks for reading this.",1192838400,,2587,4.432203389830509

2440744,4,B000BTH4K4,"This was a fascinating look at the Wal-Mart entity. The documentary takes the viewer on a back and forth ride between what the CEO of Wal-Mart says, and what they, as a corporation, do. Words versus Action. What it really exposes is the fact that the ""every day low prices"" are for paid by someone, whether they be the community, associates or Chinese workers. This show clearly demonstrates the greed of the company and the abuse that the workers suffer. It also shows the direct attack on those wishing to form a collective bargaining unit. The old axiom holds true, you can't get something for nothing, or in this case for a low price. I highly recommend this film and join with those who refuse to support these unethical practices.

One more thing that could be added, that isn't shown in this film, is the lobbying Wal-Mart did after Sept 11 to stop the federal government from inspecting more cargo that enters the US because it would cost Wal-Mart in time and sales. Sick!",1191888000,,980,4.632183908045977

What I saw was a well edited 90 minute prima facie case that there is something really wrong with Wal-Mart.  Now, I don't shop at Wal-Mart and I don't know personally anyone who works there.  I have no reason to like or dislike Wal-Mart as a company.  However, this documentary gave me pause for thought.  Is getting the lowest price on anything always, or ever, the best thing to do?

I don't have the knowledge to judge whether or not this documentary gave an accurate assessment of Wal-Mart, but I can say that it's very watchable and doesn't leave you at the half-way point looking at the little time display on your DVD player and thinking ""yikes...we're only half way through this tedious ordeal"".

Also, the bonus features are fun.  The spoof commercials are funny.

My only criticism is that I was hoping to get some insight on all the manufacturers here in America that Wal-Mart has supposedly put out of business by sourcing from China.  We get to see destroyed small businesses and gutted small towns, but no manufacturers.

2440775,4,B000BTH4K4,"I heard a lot about this documentary and finally set aside time to view it.  From the title alone you know that the film is going to be a Wal-Mart bashing story from beginning to end.  With documentaries and television news features like this I normally begin with a bias favoring the defendent -- in this case, Wal-Mart.  I expected to hear the usual digruntled rantings of lazy terminated employees and other crazies who thrive on complaints against their ""oppressive"" employers.

After watching the film I decided that my preconceived notion was incorrect.  Though there may be some professional conspiracy theorists interviewed in the movie, there are such a variety of current (as of 2005) and prior employees, both management and associates, involved in this project that there must be validity to their complaints.

The one thing that bothers me about the film is that it lacks balance.  We never get Wal-Mart's side of the issue except for pirated clips from corporate videos and short interview snippets that were lensed by someone else.  These clips are always presented with commentary, captions, or ominous music that automatically characterize them as Wal-Mart propaganda.  Surely there must be at least one current or former Wal-Mart manager or associate willing to stand in front of the store in the parking lot to say something good about the organization.

There are a lot of givens with Wal-Mart.  One of the movie portrayals is that Wal-Marts have destroyed old fashioned downtown businesses.  Face it, most downtown businesses with their limited floor space and modest hours deserved to go the way of the dinosaurs.  I remember years ago living in a small Georgia town where the Main Street businesses, complete with shoddy Mayberry awnings, already looked as if they were half abandoned.  Those still operating opened but a few brief hours and did not accept credit cards or personal checks.  These were the types of stores where you often found yourself waiting, sometimes in vain, for assistance at the register because the clerk thought it more important to finish telling his epic hospital stay or fishing story to some other flannel shirted crony.  In the case of this particular Georgia town, when it was announced that Wal-Mart was moving in there were the usual complaints about a mega store dooming Main Street businesses.  How can you doom something that is already terminal?  Those Main Street businesses that could modernized their images, rebuilt their store fronts, set up tables on potted flora on the sidewalk, and did other things to attract customers to an environment they cannot find at a mall or department store.  Others simply played the ""woe-is-me end of the family owned business"" card and shut down.

The documentary tables a lot of issues about Wal-Mart.  The most shocking is the way its employees are treated and compensated.  Low wages, unpaid overtime, threats, and at-will terminations without reason if the person is deemed a union instigator.  One premise set forth by the movie is that Wal-Mart installed security cameras not so much for controling store pilferage, but to ensure that employees are watched and dissuaded from any lawful assembly.  This is hardly late breaking news.  Wal-Mart is not alone in the way it treats its employees.  I worked for years in a large grocery store chain where managers doctored time cards (when we actually used time cards) to work underage employees well past their legal evening curfew, deferred overtime hours to subsequent days so as to avoid overtime, and greatly reduced the hours of tenured employees while at the same time provided additional work days to new hires with much lower hourly pay rates.  As such I heartily disagree with the way Wal-Mart treats its employees.  On the other hand the Wal-Mart penny-pinching workhouse philosophy is not new to the industry.

Way back in the early 1980s I never heard of Wal-Mart. Living in the Northeast and later in the Southwest there were either no or very few Wal-Marts in those areas.  It was not until we moved to Georgia that I was exposed to the Wal-Mart phenonemon.  Remember too that Wal-Mart creator Sam Walton still held the reins to this up and coming giant.  The stores at the time were almost identical.  They were clean and I do not think I ever had an interaction with an employee that was ever unpleasant.  In fact, those were the days where it was not uncommon for a store manager to randomly ask you if found everything you were looking for.  Wal-Mart was also very big on selling American made products over foreign manufacture whenever a US product was available.

Of course that was before the sudden growth surge of Wal-Marts across country and in Europe.

Wal-Mart is traditionally non-union.  The documentary spends a lot of time on Wal-Mart's battle to keep unions out.  According to the film Wal-Mart has a multi-million dollar response team that flies out on a moment's notice whenever there is a hint of union activity.  Here too it must be pointed out that Wal-Mart is hardly the only large chain store that is not unionized.  However in Wal-Mart's case maybe it should be if for no other reason but to ensure that employees are offered affordable dental, health, and prescription plans.  Many of the employees interviewed in the film discuss the high cost of Wal-Mart's health care.  More disturbing are the allegations that Wal-Mart employees are reportedly encouraged and coached to apply for state and Federal aid programs.  If true the bottom line is that our tax dollars pay the health ""benefits"" for Wal-Mart employees.

While watching the film I thought about the amount of times I shop at the retail giant.  Even though I initially walked away from the movie with a firm resolve to never frequent Wal-Mart again, I found myself driving there the following day for lawn care and back to school items.  The other similarly distanced retailers did not have what I needed and were already setting up Christmas displays -- and it is still summer.  Despite the telling evidence of the movie I have yet to find a more convenient store to pick up all the things I need at once.

The bottom line is that after watching this documentary you have to draw your own conclusions as to the absolutes:  What allegations are true, which are exaggerated, and whether any or all of the evils tabled about Wal-Mart are significantly different from those perpetrated by other retail giants.",1188604800,,6457,4.927844588344126

The average communist worker gets very little for their labor input and are exploited by the party bosses. There's a 'Catch-22' here. The party bosses tell the workers that they must work harder to avoid being the slaves of sado-christian-capitalism. Yet,their cheap labor entices foreign investment and demand for their low-cost products. The Socialist labor bosses ,who arranged the exported shipments to America,are indifferent to the destruction of American owned stores and businesses. The Chinese socialists also do not care about the Arkansas protestant business people,who will be consolidated back with the Roman catholics anyway.

2440789,1,B000BTH4K4,"I've never been a big Wal-mart fan, so I was delighted to have a chance to see this movie in my community for a newspaper assignment. Just for a reality-check, I took a Wal-mart employee. Hey, I've always wanted to ask the people who actually work there, and now I had a legitimate reason.

Oh, please. The movie made its case very badly, taking individual incidents and making them out to be company-wide problems. And really, playing some sort of Darth Vader music when Wal-mart execs came on-screen! It was so low-rent, picking hot buttons and fanning emotion. The employee was totally bewildered--she said that she could only speak for the one store she worked in, but she'd never seen any of those problems at all; she had health insurance; she'd never been discriminated against; they never had left chemicals out in the parking lot.

And personally, I'm wondering whether some of these people with romantic memories of mom and pop stores are delusional. I'm sure there were some that were fabulous, but personally I grew up in a small town where we were unmercifully ripped off by local stores. They never had a choice of product and they charged what they wanted. That's why Wal-mart got its start in rural communities, and that's why it's still most succesful there.

Slave labor? For another assignment I interviewed a man who inspects ""sweat shops"". Yes, he actually goes there. His informed opinion was that although there are still a very few bad places, the overwhelming majority are becoming pretty reasonable and many are downright decent places to work, and way better than the alternative. Surprised the heck out of me, frankly. Not the story I was gleefully anticipating.

We want developing nations to have the same standard of living we worked up to over many years of industrialization. A noble thought, but...Never mind, it's good to keep pressure on companies to expect standards overseas, but let's not go overboard and believe only by the horror stories.

And I'm always curious as to why people think mom-and-pop stores are fine not paying health insurance and employing part-timers, but it's not OK if Wal-Mart does it. Let's get real here--we need a national system. We pay 16% of our GDP for health costs; other industrialized nations pay around 10% and have care for eveyone--and longer lifespans. The producers of this excrable film would done better to have investigated that. Or maybe not, if they're going to make a pig's breakfast of things.

I'm generally considered to be a bleeding-heart liberal. But I do try hard not to simply swallow badly-researched smear stories wholesale. I still don't personally like to go to Wal-mart, but I've yet to be convinced of why I should boycott them.",1176940800,,2725,4.900216919739696
2440790,4,B000BTH4K4,"The subtitle of the movie is ""The High Cost of Low Price"" and I think that the movie does do a pretty good job of pointing out the social and economic costs of the low prices one finds at Wal-Mart.

Personally, I believe that it's essential to allow innovation, whether technological or economic, and that technologies and business models should not be stifled simply because they are successful.

Before seeing this movie, I was of the opinion that people in a community need to take personal responsibility and not shop at a Wal-Mart if they disapprove of it; if there are no customers then they can't stay in business for long, right? I also tend to think that people shouldn't expect the luxury of staying in a particular community or working at a particular job for as long as they please; the world can be an unstable place and people should be willing to follow opportunity, right?

The problem is that this philosophy is not well-suited to most people in our country and a multibillion (199 billion market cap) multi-national is exploiting rural and semi-urban population centers by using its vast resources to subdue local businesses. These communities have established marketplaces that sit at the foundation of the community's social structure. Everyone should still be providing competitive goods and services to the community and, as an example, if I were to own a local sporting goods store and I am charging too much for merchandise or providing horrible customer service then I should expect to be dethroned by another sporting goods store, the townspeople have a new place to shop for catcher's mitts and life will go on for everyone. However, entire commercial networks are being decimated in one fell swoop. This has the effect of monopolizing the supply lines into the community and the people therein no longer have the luxury of boycotting because there are no alternatives.

Still this market domination would be almost acceptable if the displaced workforce and former business owners were able to find gainful employment with a reasonable quality of life at the town's new central marketplace (which itself is a responsible member of the community). The problem is that the quality of life for the townspeople seems to take a nosedive and Wal-Mart doesn't live up to it's obligations to the community. There is an inherent lack of opportunity in small communities and when a single entity has the ability to become the primary employer for a region, it has the power to exploit the people because they have not only dominated the local marketplace for goods and services but for jobs as well.

Another thing that occurred to me while watching this is that I have never heard of a Wal-Mart rolling into a mid-to-large city and shutting down everyone else. The easiest explanation is that there are powerful competitors in larger communities that prevent such a takeover, yet small businesses can still thrive in a large city among these giants.

If the impact of Wal-Mart and their business practices on small communities are not enough to raise people's eyebrows, then their dependence on foreign sweatshops should. American workers should be willing to change careers and retrain as necessary in case there positions are outsourced or shipped overseas. The problem is that the overseas factory conditions are deplorable. The long-term solution to this is a consumer boycott of Wal-Mart. If we have knowledge of their abuses and continue to profit from them by shopping there, then it's on our heads. Unfortunately, Wal-Mart deceives the public by having them think that they actively seek domestic suppliers (whose employees are surely protected by our laws). Granted each individual could read the box or label and decide for themselves but that depends on trusting Wal-Mart's honesty (can we really be expected to rely on them) in correctly labeling points of origin.",1175904000,,3894,5.020123839009288

I don't like Wal-Mart either, but Greenwald makes a poor case in this movie.  This movie is two hours of disjointed interviews from random people.  Mostly Wal-Mart employees.  It took me effort to pay attention.

At the end of the movie, Greenwald shows ""Victory!"" signs where the citizens of various communities in the country have beaten Wal-Mart.  Victory?  That's victory?  Wal-Mart has run over so many communities in the country, it hardly seems like victory.  Wal-Mart is laughing at this movie, probably.  Americans continue to shop there and will for a very long time -- there is no victory here.

The part that opened my eyes the most in this movie is that Wal-Mart is really just a Chinese distributor.  The majority of their products are made in China.  So we Americans are helping low wages and poor working conditions in China.  Suh-weet!

Instead, this video attempts to assasinate Walmart with a cohesive string of accusations which are backed up only by emotional, tug-at-your-heartstrings arguments.  For example, the opening starts out by showcasing a close-knit, small-town family who run a mom-and-pop store in a rural, All-American community.  All the generations of this family speak glowingly of the halcyon days when their father or grandfather opened for business in 1950 or 60-something.  For years, they had a thriving business that was the backbone of their family and community.  Then the evil Walmart comes to town and puts them out of business.  <Enter sad, sappy Bruce Springsteen cut>.  Okay, so?  So what?  What else is new under the sun?  Henry Ford put the horse-and-buggy industry out of business.  But we're better off today because of it.

In another purely emotional appeal, the video discusses how Walmart employees can't afford decent health insurance.  Well, welcome to America, folks!  Health insurance is expensive for all of us, thanks to the corrupt, broken system we have.  Not to mention, when you're making $8/hr., medical care can be cost prohibitive.  So to combat this problem, does this video suggest that maybe these people should gain some valuable, marketable skills, so as to earn more money, so they can afford to pay for our expensive health care system?  No, of course not.  Don't you know it's all Walmart's fault???

The rest of the video is similar in nature.  It appears that the producer is just trying to advance a communistic, anti-capitalist agenda.  This documentary is just another propaganda piece in the same league as Fahrenheit 911 or the Loose Change video.",1173484800,,1894,5.181518151815181

the big box retailers... are the second wave of this in most areas of America. When the malls went in, and gave us all those wonderful clothing, shoe, book, and electronics stores... the main streets of America began to die.

This movie resonates with me, I assure you. The tone of the movie was alarmist and overly dramatic. The movie quotes statistics, but leaves them without any scale. They say something like Wal Mart policies put 4500 children on public assistance in Texas...how many are on public assistance? If the number is 5000, then Wal-Mart's contribution is shocking. If its 500,000, its less shocking...almost irrelevant.

I have never bought into the idea that Wal Mart is doing nothing differently than other companies are doing. Its a problem of ethics. If every company employed slave labor, would it be then OK for Wal-Mart to do so? Not necessarily. Just because abuse is rampant doesn't mean its OK to allow it to continue or to participate in it.

Some of the points from the movie I felt to resonate with me, Wal-Mart is not helping America, its laying waste to businesses with Chinese made products and reshaping rural America in the pattern of India or some other third world rural areas (watch carefully, they are painting this picture in the background). Wal-Mart is a burden to the tax-payers...we aren't really getting cheaper products...we are getting products that seem cheaper, but they are made up for by higher taxes or less government services.

If there is a problem with the United States and our job-base...we need more companies to hire more Americans at rates substantially above minimum wage. People need health-care and to be able to make enough money to provide for themselves and their families.

2440803,3,B000BTH4K4,"""Walmart: The High Cost of Low Price"" by Robert Greenwald is a well-meaning film that makes some pointed criticisms about the giant retailer.  By interviewing people who have been hurt by Walmart as well as former Walmart employees, Greenwald documents many evils committed by the corporate giant:

1.  Walmart destroys small, family-owned businesses.  Its not just the fact that Walmart's prices are lower.  Family owned business say that they could compete with lower prices because they provide better service.  However, Walmart gets huge tax subsidies, which small businesses just don't get.

2.  Walmart is openly sexist and racist to its employees.  Such attitudes seem to be coming from headquarters.  Women and Blacks are flat-out told they are not management material.  Women are disproportionately assigned demeaning tasks such as cleaning bathrooms.

3.  Walmart cheats employees out of millions of dollars of overtime.  Not only does Walmart 'guilt' employees into working those extra hours (by hinting if a particular employee won't do it, they can always get someone else), but managers are actually taught to change employee time cards!

4.  Walmart doesn't care about the environment - for example it is willing to leave fertilizers out in the open in its parking lots next to streams providing drinking water.  When it rains, the water is mixed with fertilizer run-off.

5.  Walmart is the ultimate union buster - to the level of paranoia.  It can spend more than a million dollars spying on and thwarting one single attempt at unionization - by among other things, flying union busters in on private jets.

6.  Walmart uses sweat shops and exploits the labor of Chinese and Latin American workers.  As a Chinese worker says, this is why their products are so cheap.

7.  Walmart does not pay its workers properly, nor does it offer benefits.  In fact, it encourages workers to go on Government Assistance (such as Medicaid and food stamps).  Walmart actually provides contact numbers and even teaches employees how to fill out forms!

8.  Walmart parking lots are full of crime, including robbery and rape.  Walmart is well aware of this, and even did a study suggesting that putting a guard on patrol greatly reduced parking lot crime.  Of course the study was not implemented.

Clearly Walmart is a monstrous corporation.  However, the problem is that the film makes Walmart out to be unique- a particularly twisted entity which cares about profit above all else, no matter what the consequences are.

Unfortunately, this is clearly not the case.  Walmart is hardly unique in its lust for profit and its psychopathic inability to care about its effects on others.  All corporations, by definition, are legally mandated to maximize profit.  As for corporate misdeeds past and present, Walmart does not compare all that unfavorably with its fellow corporate giants:

Enron - Among its many evils, workers caused blackouts in California and were literally cheering during massive fires in the state because the price of energy skyrocketed.

Monsanto - This agricultural corporation is buying up and destroying native (wildtype) seeds around the world, so everyone will have to buy seeds from Monsanto.  It is also using GMO 'terminator' technology to produce seeds which will only produce one harvest (ie, the plants themselves produce sterile seeds) so you have to buy seeds from Monsanto every year!

Union Carbide - a massive chemical spill as a result of cost-cutting measures and poor maintenance caused the worst industrial disaster in modern history (1984), killing 3,000 people initially, and at least 15,000 more over the years from cancer, lung disease and birth defects; people are continuing to be affected by the spill.

IBM - made massive profits by supplying Nazis with machines to track prisoners of the holocaust.

Finally, the film does not also point the finger at us, the average American Walmart shopper.  Why does no one question how Walmart gets its 'low low' prices?  Does anyone really care that Walmart exploits its workers, and cuts on safety and other measures as long as the prices remain oh so low?  Most telling - the movie relates that some exploited Walmart workers, as soon as they get their paychecks, would often use it all up...shopping at Walmart.

Saying ""NO"" to Walmart, as this film advocates, will ultimately have little effect.  As another reviewer says, another corporate giant will simply take its place, offering the same low low prices and committing the same evils.  Real change consists of changing our legal and economic systems that currently enshrine profit above all else.  It also means taking a serious look at our selves, to curb selfishness, by recognizing that indeed, there is a ""high cost"" not just to a ""low price"", but also to 'record' profits and 'soaring' markets.",1172793600,,4845,5.10178117048346

Consider the following facts about a retail giant:

(1) Small businesses in small town USA are put out of business when it comes into town

(2) The staff are paid low wages and vehemently denied representation by a union

(3) Shoppers risk rape and robbery in the store's parking lots

(4) International suppliers are exploited.

These are some of the facts this riveting documentary presents about retail megalith Wal-Mart, a company that has had massive commercial success but at a very high cost to individuals and communities.

Throughout, the viewer sees and hears mostly current and former employees or ""associates"" including several with a dozen or more years with the company.  (I say mostly because other viewpoints are presented by others such as environmentalists.)  The story they tell is not a happy one.  News clips and headline facts are also presented as well as interesting images and background music.

Wal-Mart executives refused to be interviewed.  To provide Wal-Mart's side of the story, there is mainly archival company footage used.

To give the potential viewer a ""feel"" for the content of this documentary, I will reproduce some selected statements etc. from it (these are just the tip of the iceberg):

(1)  ""If Wal-Mart's not a monopoly, I don't know what is.""

(2)  ""Wal-Mart seems to be going on a rampage through the American economy and nobody's even paying attention.""

(3)  ""Anytime a Wal-Mart comes into a town, they knock the values [of the other buildings] down.""

(4)  ""[Wal-Mart doesn't] care about what your sacrifice.  It doesn't matter how many people lose their families.  It doesn't matter if the [employees] have good health care.  It doesn't matter, anything, other than the bottom-line profit.""

(5)  ""Retail giant Wal-Mart is encouraging its employees to go on welfare instead of paying for employees to have health benefits.""

(6)  ""Why is it that a corporation that, in 2003, had an outstanding $240 billion in sales, would not provide a livable wage and affordable health care for their employees?""

(7)  ""Wal-Mart costs taxpayers [$1.5 million] to support its employees.""

(8)  ""Wal-Mart currently faces law suits in 31 different states for wage and hour abuses, potentially involving hundreds of thousands of workers.""

(9)  ""I can say in my history as a river keeper [an official who looks after rivers] that I don't think I've ever encountered a corporation, be it a power company, an oil company [etc.], as unresponsive [to environmental problems] as Wal-Mart.""

(10)  ""As the largest company in the world, Wal-Mart sets the standards that other companies are going to follow so, Wal-Mart right now is sucking down standards all across the world...[international] workers have no rights.""

(11)  ""In 2004, Wal-Mart employees gave over $5 million to help fellow workers.  The Walton family [founders of Wal-Mart who have millions] gave $6000.

This documentary ends in an interesting way with true stories about people trying to keep Wal-Mart out of their neighborhood.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2005) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has 65 minutes of good extras.

In conclusion, this may not be the most balanced documentary but it makes a powerful statement that's an antidote to the propaganda that the Wal-Mart Corporation generates!!

2440807,4,B000BTH4K4,"I will admit to having shopped at Wal-Mart in the past.  Like most people, the thought of saving one or two bucks on a pair of jeans or the kids' birthday presents was too tempting for me to pass up even though I'd heard rumors of the company's terrible treatment of its employees.  The fact is, it just didn't seem real to me until I was confronted with the stories of actual people who'd worked for Wal-Mart - and some who still were employed there.

It was obvious before I even rented this DVD that it was going to be a piece of propaganda against Wal-Mart. The giant meanie-face character smashing through a peaceful suburb on the front cover made that pretty clear from the get go.  I assumed that there were some companies with real axes to grind against Wal-Mart, competing retail chains that have been hurt by the heavy competition.  It was not such a stretch to imagine such companies backing a film like this in an effort to damage their competitor's profits.  How much credibility should one grant the claims and conclusions of such a film?

It's true that Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Price does make liberal use of emotional manipulation via interviewing many poor, put-upon employees of WM; stories unfold of wages so low that they cannot afford the company's health care program.  They must at times choose between paying for prescriptions and eating. Many full-time WM employees have to turn to public assistance programs like Medicaid.  Others talk about the stress of being constantly spied upon though store cameras and managers to ensure that they do not conspire to unionize (suspicion of which is enough for management to find an excuse to fire).  Former managers reveal how they were told to profile employees based on how they socialized with others and body language, to determine if they were talking union.  They also admitted to understaffing on purpose to cut costs, even though it caused the workers there to finish the job with unpaid overtime.  This all painted a condemning picture of a company that just doesn't care about the welfare of its people.

 But underneath these sad anecdotes, the case against the retail giant made by this film is backed by several logical arguments.  First, that the many WM employees who are forced to use government programs like Medicaid are increasing costs to us, the taxpayers.  Second, the unattractive detail that WM buys primarily from China instead of American-made goods.  Nice, Wal-Mart!  Fits with your ""all-American"" image.  And finally, when the last segment of the film revealed the appalling lack of parking lot security - which accounts for WM nationwide being the sites of more crimes like robberies, rapes and murders than any other store - well, I don't like to shop at a store that cares so little for me, the customer.  A selfish motivation on my part of course, but it was the last straw that got to me. Do I trade my safety for low prices? I decided that I didn't need that cheap pair of sweatshop jeans so badly after all.

I realize that there well may be another side to this story that I haven't heard, but until WM does something to A) provide affordable health care for its employees, B), Starts buying American, and C) shows visibly reduced parking lot crime due to increased security, I will be disinclined to hear that other side.  The richest retail family in the country could afford to crack open their wallets a bit more.

As a documentary, Wal-Mart; the High Cost of Low Price did an adequate job of presenting its case.  It was not thrilling entertainment, but a good way to learn the issues behind the controversy of this successful retail chain.

2440810,2,B000BTH4K4,"Talk about FUD.  ""UGH! WAL-MART MAKE MONEY, WAL-MART EVIL!""  Now, I can just hear the ""Republican/neo-con"" insults coming, but save it... I'm about as far from a Republican as one can be.  I just believe that people have the right to make their own decisions and should be responsible for their own lives, not ask Big Daddy Guv'ment to fix their mess of a life.

Two points:

1. No one makes you shop at Wal-Mart.  Therefore, how can Wal-Mart be responsible for small businesses closing.  If I want to sell my land to Wal-Mart for them to open a store, that's my right to do so.  If people don't want Wal-Mart in their community, the best way to handle it is to not shop there.  If enough people do that, then Wal-Mart will make no money and leave.  If the small businesses offer the best products at the best prices, and the most value for ones dollar, then they will prosper.  It's VERY possible... small businesses have thrived in direct competition with Wal-Mart in every town I've lived in.

2. No one makes you work at Wal-Mart.  You do not have a right to a job.  If you did not graduate high school and cannot get work elsewhere, then that's NOT Wal-Mart's fault and they should not be required to pay for your mistakes.  You also have EVERY right to leave and find another job.  This goes for people in China as well.  They need to make their own decisions.  If they want to sell their labor to Wal-Mart, then they can.  If they don't like the conditions, then it's up to them to change it.  It's been done before... it happened here in the US and in the UK.

The flim is a psychological experience designed to lead you into agreeing with its conclusions.  The mood music, the heartbreaking tales... make no mistake, this film is designed to influence your opinion, as most documentaries are nowadays.  This piece of garbage belongs in the same category as ""Loose Change"" and Michael Moore's schlock... pure scare tactics.

Viewers should stop thinking with their hearts and start using their brains.",1167264000,,2009,4.5474860335195535
2440811,5,B000BTH4K4,"There's a lot that I appreciated about this film, especially how it covers not just what Wal-Mart does to US workers and small businesses, but also how it negatively effects people in other parts of the world.  There's a segment that features a former gung-ho Wal-Mart manager who was sent to check out the situation in Wal-Mart's factories in Latin America.  He was appalled, and he was further appalled by the response from Wal-Mart.  He talks about how kind the Latin American people are, and it drove him to tears to see how they were exploited.

There's another moving segment of the film that gives voice to workers in China.

Wal-Mart has opened hundreds of stores in Mexico, which are decimating the small stores and sucking money out of that country and into the accounts of the billionaire Walton siblings.  Needless to say, this corporate predation is leading to more economic dislocation and migration.

Wal-Mart is now in the planning (and bribing) process of opening hundreds of stores in India, which will harm India's wonderful tradition of open air markets.

This corporate tyranny needs to stop, and there is a growing movement against it.  In addition to this DVD, I'd highly recommend the documentary ""The Corporation.""",1166227200,,1239,4.975728155339806

2440813,2,B000BTH4K4,"Sadly this amounts to little more than an hour and a half of preaching to the choir. The film honestly needed to offer comparisons to other large corporations, and how Wal-Mart differs. Small business owners complain about being driven out of business by Wal-Mart's low prices, yet any national chain has the advantage of economy of scale. Why is Wal-Mart the bad guy, and not Target, Best-Buy, etc? The film shows the struggles to unionize, but drops the ball in disclosing what happens in the rare instances where a store does set up a union: it is immediately closed, and a new store is opened in virtually the same location, with no former employee being eligible for re-hiring. The film describes treatment of foreign factory workers as though the situation is unique to Wal-Mart's factories. What would have been more powerful is a look at how Wal-Mart, as one of the largest movers of product is able to dictate other company's production methods, and influence the conditions of workers not even employed by them. For that matter, Wal-Mart's forcing the censorship of movies and CD's isn't even touched upon. Unfortunately, this will do little to convince someone not already in the anti-Wal-Mart camp. The rave reviews of this documentary seem to stem primarily from agreement with the sentiment presented rather than an actual evaluation of the substance. This topic deserves a more detailed look than the overly sentimental, cursory glance given here.",1163980800,,1462,5.045454545454546
2440814,4,B000BTH4K4,"I have never been a huge fan of Wal-Mart, I admit, but I came to this documentary with a lot of curiosity and willingness to see what else I could find out about them. Most of the elements presented were fairly well known and public, so there wasn't much new I picked up from it.

The point of view offered was clearly biased, portraying in a negative light every aspect of how Wal-Mart conducts business. Not to say that they are saints (I feel they aren't an example of corporate social responsibility), but as the movie neared the end, it seemed the director was after any negative argument he could make, without even granting them that they make a difference to the lives of millions who are able to afford their shopping thanks to their low prices.

That said, the point of the documentary is indeed on detailing the side consequences that Wal-Mart's low costs bring about to society at large. They negatively impact the lives of underpaid/uninsured associates and taxpayers at large who end up being affected by subsidies Wal-Mart obtains and the burden they indirectly pose on the system by having so many of their associates rely on government programs for health, food and housing. By pushing to bankruptcy many local small businesses, they typically become the largest employers in the markets where they arrive, leaving low-income workers with little option if they want to stay in their towns.

Not having read much about Sam Walton's original vision, I can imagine him not being cool with the way things have turned with the business he founded. Greed brings out bad things, indeed...",1163376000,,1598,4.824817518248175

I understand this movie is made in the same way political ads are, where they try really hard to skew the facts to make the viewer have an emotional reaction to the half of the story that is provided. I think that for most people it is highly effective, but it didn't work for me.  I think this is an excellent movie to show as an example of skew, perspective, and propaganda.

When they talk about the sweatshops in China and Honduras I found myself --though I don't envy the workers-- laughing at the movie.  I used to live in China and I have been to many factories and the conditions that they make seem exclusive are universal over there.  It is the film makers and then the ex-employees (and they are assuming the viewers) who are putting their cultural assumptions about how sad it is that they work so hard and get paid so little, but in other countries that is a fact of life that has nothing to do with Wal-Mart. That is a cultural and governmental problem within the countries where the factories exist, not only a problem with Wal-Mart.

The movie also discuss how Wal-Mart employees are a burden to the government because of the fact that Wal-Mart pays very  little and then suggests that it's employess go on public assitance, but the truth is that is the same for the fast-food companies and everywhere else that pays minimum wage and offers little benefits.

I do believe Wal-Mart should morally proivide their employees with more wages and provide more full-time positions, but that is a business culture that expands well past Wal-Mart. I am a teacher who cannot work more than 17 hours a week so they do not have to give me benefits, but I don't see anyone trying to make movies to ban schools.",1161820800,,1774,4.525

I was addicted to Wal-Mart and spent more than a few thousand dollars there.  NO MORE!  I am shocked, but not surprised that Wal-Mart is a modern-day slave plantation...and of course, only in America is slavery still approved of under the guise of corporate profits and benefits to the consumer.

2440820,4,B000BTH4K4,"Right from the start, you get the impression of  a family's impending doom. They have run a successful business for a generation and have been members of their community for several more. The juggernaut Walmart is about to move into the area. The viewer wonders, but knows what will befall the family business.

As the producer points out, this has occurred all over America where Walmart has set up shop, demanded more services from the county treasury, and ran local stores into bankruptcy, destroying main streets everywhere. If the Wallmart is not profitable, it will be shut down. It will leave a vacant building and parking lot and a shuttered main street like the parasite that has sucked the life out of its host.

Robert Greenwald also focuses on the Walmart employees who are forced to work long hours sans overtime, health care, or union protection. On this last one, in particular, Walmart fights tooth and nail with a rapid response force of lawyers that will descend on the wayward employees the same day the news reaching them. (When Walmart butchers successfully unionized in Wisconsin, the company closed down the butcher shops in those stores.)

Many employees are paid so poorly that they cannot afford the cost of health coverage the company provides. They get public assistance and must apply for food stamps. Ironically, Wallmart touts their wonderful health plan that would cost many of their employess almost half their salary.

The odd part of this documentary was seeing Walmart's CEO addressing a crowd of enthusiastic Wallmart employees extolling Walmart's exemplary employee treatment. It had more of the look of an Amway convention where individual achievement is encouraged. And that is about all that Walmart is willing to offer them. Their contributions to employees and charities is such a shamefully low amount, you come away with the feeling that the Walmart family heirs still own their first dime.

When confronted with a Walmart-resistant community, they may resort to underhanded telephone surveys or barraging opponent's phone lines. For this they will spare no expense.

If Greenwald's purpose was to steer me away from Walmart, he succeeded. I have no wish to profit from someone else's misery. You too may want to say ""No Sale"" to shopping at Walmart.

The price is just too high.",1157500800,,2324,5.049608355091384
2440821,4,B000BTH4K4,"Filmmaker Robert Greenwald has effectively made mincemeat of his targets in a couple of recent fiery documentaries - Rupert Murdoch and the FOX Network in ""Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism"", and the Bush administration in ""Uncovered: The War on Iraq"". His latest is no exception as he lays into Wal-Mart, its CEO Lee Scott and Sam Walton's heirs in this probing 2005 critique of corporate injustice. Instead of providing a single narrative voice, Greenwald structures his film as a series of vignettes focusing on discrete instances of where Wal-Mart has violated fair market practices, passed over women and minorities for leadership positions, restricted movements toward employee unionization, taken advantage of cheap labor in China and India, and disregarded environmental standards.

The grievances seem endless, and the film even discloses the embarrassingly paltry amounts each Walton family member has given to charitable causes (compared to Bill Gates, of course). The most touching episodes focus on victims like Red Esry, who are experiencing the closure of their multi-generational small businesses in small towns where Wal-Mart opens and cannibalizes the competition. Much of the treatment seems ham-fisted, especially in the juxtaposition of Wal-Mart commercials and in-house training videos within the context of those being crushed by the corporation's economic clout. Moreover, the one segment about the rape of an employee in a parking lot, while horrific, seems more generic in nature than Wal-Mart's accountability in the incident. The abundance of conjecture and the lack of attributable facts tend to affect some of the film's credibility.

However, Greenwald makes his points with clarity. Especially effective is the use of archived footage of Scott asserting to a massive audience of his employees that Wal-Mart has done nothing but good for the economy, even though many of them have to go on welfare to get medical care. The film ends with a montage of people who have successfully lobbied against the construction of stores in their towns. At the same time, Greenwald has not made a monomaniacal diatribe, as the takeaway never feels like the destruction of Wal-Mart but more a call for a severe overhaul of their internal practices. The filmmaker has certainly come a long way since his 1980 feature film debut, the ludicrous ""Xanadu"", and he seems to be continuing his streak of confronting those corrupted by their power.

The DVD has several extras, the best being a twenty-minute making-of featurette and a separate 16-minute short, ""The Big Meeting"", on how the film came about. Greenwald also provides a commentary track, though much of what he shares can be gleaned from the featurettes. There are a couple of deleted segments that do seem redundant if they were included in the movie (one set in Quebec, the other in England), as well as a brief clip of local religious leaders condemning Wal-Mart's practices. Lastly, there are several fitfully funny Wal-Mart commercial parodies that apparently served as commercials for the documentary. Those looking for a more-in-depth analysis of Wal-Mart's business impact may want to read Charles Fishman's ""The Wal-Mart Effect: How the World's Most Powerful Company Really Works - and How It's Transforming the American Economy"".",1155513600,,3321,5.35823754789272

I'm talking about hourly wage after 40 hours. Taxpayers contribute around a billion dollars a year that Wal-mart should be paying. They hire illegal workers and lock them in the building. No surveillance cameras in the parking lot. Once you buy their stuff, your safety is your problem.

Hard working American business people (more than likely Republicans) are being put out of business. Men and women who want to keep working in their 50s and 60s, who have their own business or franchise is forced into retirement and their hard working children and grandchildren who put their time into the business thinking someday it will be theirs (or just because they love their parents/grandparents) and watch Wal-mart destroy their parents and their future.

2440827,3,B000BTH4K4,"An interesting show with a hefty dose of sensationalism - the problem is that Robert Greenwald isn't as smooth with his 3 ring circus as Michael Moore can be.  For the record, I despise WalMart and I think it should burn - but only after they have rebuilt the distributor/retailer framework so all of the smaller stores can pick up the supply/demand slack without any transitional pains.  There are many good points made in this movie, but an equal (or greater) number of eyebrow raisers.

When they're showing how poor and destitute all of the businesses have become in the first town, why is there a lingering shot of a hotel?  Is WalMart stealing from the Holiday Inns and HoJos too?!?

The sound mixing is exceptionally poor, all WalMart commercials are playing at 120% volume, while some interviews are playing at %60 volume.  At one point there is schmaltzy sentimental music playing, along with a voiceover by the interviewed subject, both playing over a shot of the interviewed subject talking on the phone - all three audio sources are potted up to max, trying to drown each other out.

The ""spinning headline smashing into the TV screen"" effect helped this film in the impact department a lot, I used to get the same sense of excitement and urgency from Super Friends every Saturday morning.  These days I can only get it from tabloids, so it's refreshing to see this style of presentation make a comeback.  Many of the statistics are showed briefly, and never cite any research performed or methods used.  Seriously, how did they get hard numbers for WalMart's 'super-secret' union busting equipment and procedures (one of the most fascinating points of the movie, but not explored to any extent)?

Yes, people get mugged in parking lots.  Yes, I believe that the WalMarts brought into question have a responsibility to maintain a certain level of safety on their premises.  But this movie makes it sound like WalMart is responsible for fostering the crime itself.  These are problems that begin outside of WalMart's parking lots, and fingers should be pointed in other places (median income, environment, law enforcement, etc) for the most part.

Greenwald has reached beyond his abilities here in my opinion, there are times when you get the feeling that he is reaching (as with the parking lot crimes).  The ending ""Victory"" montage was an amusing attempt at group hugging - victory over what?  I still drive past two Walmarts in my 45 minute commute and I don't see any of them closing.

Wow.

I can't shop there anymore. Rats.

Sam Walton may have been a swell guy, but, his kids and the CEO are money hungry evil greedy pigs. Billions of dollars in their pockets and they can't even give employees a fair deal? Unpaid overtime, heath care issues, lies, threats of being fired if one doesn't stay in line etc.

The sad part is how small business in a town close down anytime a new Wal-mart comes to that town. Family owned hardware stores, that were in business for 30 - 40 years, shut down due to loss of customers to Wally. Very sad. Workers in China and other countries that work for pennies in Wal-mart sweat shops, very sad.

Ecological violations, murder in the parking lots, all ignored by Wal-mart. Things that could be solved with a little bit of money and common sense, but they choose to not address it. Bottom line is the money, at the expence of people's lives.

As for the documentary itself, it kept my interest, the people were real and interesting, the direction etc good.

As I live in Microsoft land, neighbor of Bill Gates, I found it interesting that Mr. Gates gives away 50% of his income to charities, and that the Walton family gives like zip. Even more interesting, the statistic of Wal-mart employees gave over 5 mil to their in-store charity, and the Walton family gave $6000. What goes around comes around. they should be worried.

On one hand, the filmmakers had it easy, because the crimes and abuses committed by Wal Mart are well-documented in the thousands of lawsuits filed against it by citizens, government regulators, current and former employees, etc.  Yet on the other, I think they did a good job of telling the story from a personalized perspective and showed the impact of WM and its practices on the communities in which it does business.

I'm fortunate to live in Seattle, where the only Wal Mart / Sam's Club locations are out in the 'sticks' and no possibility of getting any closer (there's no room and we're too liberal, thank goodness).  However, to those Americans who have the evil boxes in close proximity: don't think that the pricetag on the items you buy from WM are reflective of the overall costs to you.  They do not reflect the massive tax and social burdens placed on you and your communities by the grossly underpaid/unbenefitted employees who rely on your state and local welfare/public assistance systems to keep their heads above water.  They do not account for the environmental and social impact of a company that writes checks instead of righting wrongs.  They do not account for the massive widening of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in our country.

This attack on the world's largest retailer was a big eye-opener. I've always looked at Wal-Mart as a very shady place, but some of the things that this film exposes are just evil. Even by their standards.

It's true that the movie lacks narration, and is unfocused (except for the uplifting final segment). It's also true that the editing and production values are lo-fi and unprofessional, but I actually like that, because it makes the movie feel more working class; more believable; more honest.

The focus here is entirely on the information, and the information SHINES. The filmmaker(s) attack Wal-Mart from many different angles, from their effects on communities (destroying family-owned businesses), to their slave labor-esque overseas shops, to their apathy for keeping the environment in competent shape, to some things that just don't make any sense. They're one of the richest companies in the world, and yet they don't want to shell out money for good health plans for their workers? For good security in their parking lots? For the victims of the friggin' September 11th attacks?!

It's also pretty funny (but also pretty depressing) when they use clips of Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott and The Daily Show's Jon Stewart to make fun of Wal-Mart's own idiocy.

To the reviewers who say that the movie is one-sided: The filmmakers asked Wal-Mart to explain themselves/give their perspective, and they declined. Suspicious, anyone?

I didn't realize until watching this video that they were totally uncaring for the environment and they treat their employees so badly.  Also, whenever they move into a community they actually decrease land values besides driving out many many small businesspeople.  Then they can potentially kill the town they move into and leave a giant vacant building as an eyesore in what may have been a thriving community before WalMart moved in.

For some reason they cut some people off before they're able to finish a sentence and it's very jarring. They do this frequently too. Somebody will be talking and then all the sudden they cut somebody else. There are also audio problems in the movie. Sometimes the background music they add in will totally downed out the person speaking. Other times it's fine. So whoever was responsible for that did a sloppy job. That's why I'm giving this movie 4 stars.

On the other hand, I think they did an excellent job finding real people and the effects WalMart has had on their lives. I will admit that I do shop at WalMart but only because I have to. One woman in the movie said that she gets a pay check every week and her money gets put right back into WalMart. I'm in the exact same situation. I shop there because I don't have the money to shop any place else. And there are many small stores that have closed down in my neighborhood due to the WalMart opening.

2440853,4,B000BTH4K4,"'Wal Mart, The High Cost Of Low Price' is filled with first hand testimonials and some hard-fact figures that will help in validating your hatred of this greedy giant, and visually exposes those in other countries who are ruthlessly used as slaves to produce the cheap products you purchase when you patronize this monolith.

These ""jobs"" provided to the labor forces of India, China, Bangladesh, and Mexico are not 'good wage' jobs even for third world standards.  The people are overworked, underpaid, and forced to work in sub-human conditions.  These human beings make 13 to 17 cents and hour, and work 10 to 18 hour days without breaks, all so you can have that $1.49 blouse.

Exposed in this film are the squalid, rent controlled apartments in China, provided by the company, that put to shame the most rancid ghetto house in your hometown.  And if the employee chooses not to live in these rat-infested housing developments, the rent is still deducted from their wages.  Wal-Mart has managed to lower the work standards set for these hard-pressed, low wage, third-world countries that other companies are going to follow, sucking down the standards of working all across the world.

The manager of the Mexico factories went on a tour to make sure that working conditions were humane.  He was fired when he reported that the conditions were intolerably inhumane.  In his own words, he didn't think retaliation would be brought against him for doing his job.

If you think it was a good thing that America abolished slavery, then think again before you go into a Wal-Mart.  Just because the US is no longer ""importing"" slaves, doesn't make it right to continue to use slavery in other countries to produce high profits for personal gain.  Wal-Mart's practices are no different than bringing slaves over from Africa to pick our cotton, it's still a cheap way for the rich to get richer at the expense of human blood and sweat.

Intermittently inserted in the film is a speech made by Lee Scott to the high-end employees and stockholders of Wal-Mart, which sounds very much like an Amway pep-talk.  Lee Scott's earnings for 2005 were $27,207,799.00.  The average Wal-Mart hourly employee's was $13,861.00.

Interesting facts:  After 9/11, the Walton's built themselves an underground bunker in case of another terrorist attack, costing millions of dollars that should have went into paying back the Government for having to subsidize their employee's un-affordable medical benefits.

The Walton family gave less than 1% of their wealth to charity.  Bill Gates, not even a nice man himself, gave 58%.

The ""Critical Need"" fund, set up to assist Wal-Mart employees in emergencies, received five million dollars from Wal-Mart employees (making $13,861.00 annually) and only $6,000.00 from the Walton family, who made, collectively, 102 billion.

Wal-Mart actually had a commercial campaign about ""buying American"" while all their products come from sweatshops overseas.

Wal-Mart has refused to address crime statistics that show an upswing of violent crime in their large, remote, under-lit and un-protected parking lots, putting their customers in danger and taxing the local law enforcement.  The State of California alone paid out 80 Million dollars in medical benefits to poverty-level Wal-Mart employees because the 102 Billion Dollar Walton family does not want to give their ""associates"" fair medical benefits.

There are many ways to hate Wal-Mart and its ilk, and many books out on the subject, but I recommend watching this DVD so you can actually see the slave workers and conditions overseas that these selfish billionaires exploit without passing down their profit to the ""small people"" who helped build their empire.  The presentation could have used a little more snappiness, and the DVD starts out very slow, but keep watching and you will eventually see the monster peeking out from behind your curtain.

Stop shopping at Wal-Mart.  Just stop.  You don't need their cheap goods that fall apart two days after you bring them home, and it feels good to know that you make a difference by not supporting slavery.  Enjoy!",1139184000,,4135,5.102526002971768
2440860,1,B000BTH4K4,"I should state up front that this review is based on the quality of this film, not the subject matter.  I actually agree with the basic premise of the film (that Wal-Mart is bad for us), and I'm amazed that the Greenwald took aim at such a large, easy target ... and missed.

Films like this are categorized as documentaries by default ... really they're video essays.  Successful video essays, like Michael's Moore's ""Roger and Me"" or ""Bowling for Columbine"" take a general thesis, and look at it from different points of view.  Even if the film-maker has an obvious bias and selects footage to make his or her point, at least there is some coherence and structure.

In Lytton Strachey's biographical essay ""The Sad Story of Dr. Colbatch,"" he writes:  ""The rector of Orewell was 'a casuistic drudge,' a 'plodding pupil of Escobar,' an insect, a snarling dog, a gnawing rat, a maggot, and a cabbage-head.  His intellect was as dark as his countenance; his 'eyes, muscles, and shoulders were wrought up in the most solemn posture of gravity'; he grinned horribly; he was probably mad; and his brother's beard was ludicrously long.""

Strachey begins his description of the rector of Orewell with quoted ""facts,"" but then he drops the quotes and extrapolates into such increasingly ridiculous descriptions as ""cabbage-head.""  Strachey does this for laughs.  Greenwald does the same thing in ""The High Cost of Low Price,"" but he expects us to take him seriously.  Just after the segment on how Wal-Mart is to blame for rapes or murders that happened to take place in their parking lots (maybe they are, but Greenwald does little to convince us there's a real connection there), I bet my wife that the next segment would be about how the Wal-Mart store managers are all satan-worshippers.

Greenwald's overzealous Wal-Mart bashing isn't his only fault.  He interviews some of his subjects in bizarre, distracting locations--one while driving down the Strip in Las Vegas, another one who appears to be reading his lines off a laptop, etc.  During another interview, he shows a close-up of the subject's coffee.  The repeated use of a U.S. map that was missing the State of Delaware had us first-staters scratching our heads--it's not like we don't have Wal-Marts here.

In the end, Greenwald hurts his cause by over-reaching to the point of making his thesis laughable.  This film should have been made by someone else, someone who structured it as a coherent argument and not as a hack propaganda piece.",1139011200,,2498,4.895486935866983
2440861,5,B000BTH4K4,"I live in Indonesia.  We had a Walmart store open here in 1997.  A few months later an angry mob looted the store and burned it down.  The local Indonesian business partner was soon after indicted in an influence peddling scandal in the USA during the Clinton administration and consequently paid the largest fine ever imposed on an individual.  Walmart did not re-open here again.

I recently visited America and shopped at a Walmart Supercentre.  I was astounded at the range of products offered and also the `everyday low prices'.  From my perspective, as a shopper, Walmart was great.  But I was also startled at how much Americans seemed to have an aversion to Walmart, so when I found this DVD on Amazon.com I was delighted at the prospect of understanding their perspective.

There are three basic standard business strategies that a company can follow.

Strategy 1.  Low profit margins combined with high sales volumes (Walmart is a good example).

Strategy 2.  High profit margins combined with low sales volumes (e.g. Mom and Pop stores).

Strategy 3.  A niche market (e.g. Krispy Kreme)

There are clear implications of following each strategy, but let's focus on strategy 1.  To get a high total profit, Walmart has to sell a lot of product because each item it sells leads to a tiny profit (since the profit margins are low in strategy 1).  To get these high sales volumes, Walmart has to have low prices for its customers.  To get low prices for its customers, Walmart has to keep its costs low and its main costs are the expense of the goods it sells, the outlay for its staff and taxes.

This documentary highlights the squeeze that Walmart management puts on these costs via an overwhelming paternalistic corporate culture.  In fact, the company pays its staff so low that many employees are on government support programs.  Unfair pay differences between men and women are emphasized, as is racism (although both are national problems, not specific to Walmart).  The company provides a healthcare program that the staff has to pay for.  This is all topped by a rabid anti-union approach that involves intimidating those seeking to organize unions.

The film also highlights the large political donations made by the owning family and their small charitable donations; large tax subsidies by local and federal government; crime in the parking lots; and the plight of the cheap labor in the countries from which Walmart imports (especially China).  Further, it draws attention to local shops that are forced to close by the crushing competition of a newly opened Walmart.  Unfortunately the filmmakers chose to highlight a long established family run hardware store that closed before the new local Walmart opened and which closed for unrelated reasons.

The film has no narrator and was poorly edited.  But the filmmakers used a clever device of taking snippets from the Walmart CEO's speeches and then attempting to show that what he was saying in his speeches was false.  Nevertheless, most of what the film highlights is simply a reflection of the fact that Walmart successfully follows a low margin-high volume business strategy. Overall I am glad I bought this DVD as now I understand why Americans are so ambivalent about the company.  That said, I will remain a Walmart customer.",1139011200,,3303,4.950909090909091

The workers who they interview in this movie make it seem like Wal-mart is the only place to get a job. Also I know that walmart sometimes isn't a great thing to come into a small community but would it be all the same if a Shopko or K-mart came in. I live in a small town the closest Walmart is a hour away in Iron Mountain and there not freaking out or anything. Even though this was a beautifully made documentary how it stays on dissing Walmart and doesn't focus on anything else is the reason I'm giving this movie 1 star.

2440865,1,B000BTH4K4,"This film is essentially a multimedia text on how to construct a lopsided and ineffective documentary. The filmmakers, who are never introduced or shown on camera, reinforce many of the bad habits that social science professors spend entire semesters trying to wring out of underclassmen. These problems fall into two categories, structural and content-based.

First, the film suffers from terrible one-sidedness. Complaints in this category include some pretty egregious oversights, such as the filmmakers' failure to use even one original interview with anybody pro-Walmart. All of the (infinitesemal) amount of time spent providing a feeble counterbalance to the makers' primary claims is made up of stock footage and old anti-Walmart television reports. The dizzying bias of perspective would be excusable if the makers made an honest effort to gather defenders of Walmart. Indeed, an intellectually honest debate would strengthen, not weaken, their point. Any college freshman can tell you that a good way to improve your term paper is to consider the counterarguments to your point. The makers apparently failed all their 101's.

Also, the makers commit themselves to one type of critique, and it happens to be the least effective. The film's dual focus is on  former employees of Walmart, and the difficulties they encountered trying to form unions, receiving back pay, and obtaining healthcare, among other things. Some of their complaints are legitimate, others not for the simple reason that these people worked for the company for so many years. It is hard to accept as your primary evidence the testimony of individuals who consciously chose to work for their oppressors. The flip side of the film's main point is the family businesses and communities affected by Walmart's razing of the economic landscape of middle America. While the connection between Walmart being the only store in town and its driving the standard of living for unskilled workers down is a legitimate argument, the documentary fails to make it convincingly. Here, referencable statistics would have helped.

As for content flaws, I will try to be brief and not-too condescending:

1. The filmmakers cite about 10 statistics in 90 minutes, an anemic figure that leaves many of the more structured audience members pining for legitimate corroboration of hysterical claims. When the makers did offer figures, they were always in absolute terms and without points of reference. $1 billion either is or is not a large sum of money, and without comparison we cannot know. Saying that Walmart costs such-and-such a state X million in welfare allowances a year means nothing if the makers do not tell us things such as how many employees would have been on welfare if they worked somewhere else or not at all, etc.

2. Walmart is chastised at several points in the film for ""breaking promises,"" yet we are never shown even one snippet of a one contract. While the argument that Walmart was responsible for a rape that occurred in its parking lot sounds impossibly naive, it would have been nice for the makers to at least attempt to prove that Walmart guaranteed security patrols, rather than just gathering emotional residents to claim the store had.

3. Someof the subtopics (beyond looking at the Smalltown USA vs. Walmart emotional battles) do not demonize Walmart as much as the makers had hoped. For example, when the film takes an abrupt detour to China to examine working conditions in Walmart's subsidiary factories, the girl they interview concludes her testimony with the same claim many Walmart workers in American make: ""It's the best job available for me.""

What, pray tell, is wrong with this? Even the viewer unschooled in economics can look at the situtation depicted in China and conclude that maybe the answer is MORE such workshops, who would then have to bid up wages and the quality of work. Indeed, even in America this principle holds true. When target, costco, and kohl's show up in town to compete with walmart, wages rise across the board. When they don't it's due to a lack of competition.

4. My final complaint: many of the problems the makers put on Walmart's shoulders are government failures, not the fault of a profit-seeking company (which i think most americans expect to pursue money at any costs.) For example, parking lot crime is endemic to all cities, not just the pavement in front of one particular company's store. Polluting a river, which Walmart has done, is supposed to be halted in this nation by governments empowered to sue on behalf of public property. Many times politicians are in bed with Walmart, but this is not a problem specific to that company. This also goes with the claim that Walmart drives out other companies with help of corporate subsidies. True, but misleading. All large companies receive from the local government startup subsidies for new stores, because local governments reap higher tax revenue in the end. It is a back-scratching graft program that helps all of corporate america, not just Walmart.

These documentarians (I shudder to call them that) make Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore look truly fair and balanced. And, also kind of smart.",1138492800,,5193,5.084507042253521

The lack of consideration for humanity shown by this corporation is appalling. Walmart, as the top seller of consumer goods in the United States, if not the world, has an opportunity to change the world for the better.  Instead, they pay a substandard wage, forcing fulltime employees to seek welfare benefits, pollute the environment, destroy local mom and pop stores and expolit workers in third world nations all in the name of low prices and the almighty dollar.

The title really sums it up. Basically, while people in town get low priced poorly made items from China that allow them to have more things, this richness is deceptive because what they give up is their storefronts, their health care, a living wage for workers, etc. In sum, small towns completely eviscerate their local economy. The low cost has a high price.",1138406400,,627,4.460869565217391

If, just if, you love wal-mart because they trade their financial resources to create jobs worldwide and provide a low cost product without destroying anyones pivate property--you'll just get migraines.",1138320000,,590,4.898989898989899

2440880,5,B000BTH4K4,"A spendid documentary film of what the Walmart model is doing to this country (and yes, other large retailers have adopted the model, but Walmart is the biggest.)

Much more content driven than say, a Moore film.  I especially liked the details on how much government subsidy the so called freemarket capitalist corporation gets which makes it even more harder to for the mom and pop shops to compete with the juggernaught. This movie is kind of like the classic novel ""America's Keenest City"" by Mongo in the way it shows the repurcussions of local governments using the power of government to help big chains at the expense of local businesses. DVD also has special features including short clips of Walmart in Canada and England, and a hilarious collection of spoofs on Walmart commercials.

To address the spurious complaint that it is one sided:

1) the director commentary tells that they tried desperately to get the Walmart representatives to tell their side, but they wouldn't.

2) Included in the film is a running list of speaches by the President of Walmart, himself.",1137974400,,1079,4.906593406593407

2440883,3,B000BTH4K4,"I had to watch this film because I am embarking on a big writing project on wal-mart.  It is intended as a no-holds-barred indictment of the company, and at this it is utterly relentless and does not seek any sense of fair balance or acknowledge the full complexity of the issues.

The film is divided into the familiar themes of wal-mart critics, namely, the devastating effect that the company can have on businesses in the communities it enters, the alleged treatment of its ""associates"", its global sweatshop network, its political activities, and its apparent indifference to its impact, etc.

While there is a lot of truth in these allegations, I would have liked a more honest attempt at providing a more neutral perspective. People go to wal-mart because its business model (consistently cheap prices, huge scale economies, and an incredibly efficient supply/logistic chain) works - that is indisputable and should serve as a starting point for any understanding of what the company does and why.

That being said, the film will serve anti-wal-mart activists admirably:  there is no question that there is a huge groundswell of criticism and protest against the company, and it better take heed.

The device used in the film is to show tapes of wal-mart CEO Lee Scott and/or wal-mart commercials - to show how wal-mart wishes to portray itself - and then to seek points of view that contradict these statements.  This, in my opinion as a specialist in corporate social responsibility, is an extremely useful way for activists to get at the company.  If it doesn't live up to its stated ideals, let the people know.  While the film is lopsided in its portrayal, this rightly appears quite devastating.  The viewer wonders if wal-mart is the standard oil or railroads, so reviled in the guilded age, for our era.

Furthermore, the film charges that Scott's statements are lies and a conscious sham, deviously engineered for appearences without any basis in reality.  I do not know if I wd go that far, as corporations are massive organizations and there is a difference between local implementation and the real intentions of its top leadership.  Nevertheless, former wal-mart managers attest to this accusation in the film, including a tearful one who claims he was fired for attempting to point our contradictions between the company's rhetoric and practices.  Again, this can be a tool of activists to get the company to pay attention to critics, particularly through media campaigns.

However, when the film got into details that I knew about from previous reporting work (i.e. by my own witness), I tired of its bias and lack of nuance.  For example, there is a section on how poorly Chinese workers are treated.  In a word, they are by our standards, but many of them are so poor that they are thankful for the work, which allows unskilled girls to save dowwery payments, proletariat workers to create businesses in their home regions when they return, and to support elederly parents.  Moreover, the companies that hire them are subcontractors of wal-mart and hence not under its direct control - that means that wal-mart must monitor them and then induce them to change their policies, which to put it mildly is easier said than done.  As such, while they deserve better work environments, the questions of how to achieve that and what is realistic in an underdeveloped economy are very complex (though not undoable in my view, whatever measures are taken may never satisfy critics).  None of this was addressed in the film, which merely portrayed the workers as angry by one couple's experience.  Regretably, this made the rest of the film suspect to me, as I wondered what else was portrayed so one-sidedly.

One of the more interesting aspects of the film is a bit on grassroots campaigns to block the establishment of new wal-marts in certain communities, some of which were run by Republican conservatives.  The company ignores this at its peril.  It is the type of challenge that will eventually impact its bottom line, though I doubt activists could ever kill the company.

To sum up, I did not learn much from this film.  wal-mart is controversial, and its policies have multiple levels of impacts - e.g. it can help employees, but it uses them as well. Any business does that.  But it does offer a vivid portrayal of why activists want to attack the company, which I will certainly use in my work. These attacks will only increase, in my view, and rightly so.  Witness, for example, a story I saw this morning in the newspapers:  Maryland passed legistlation to force wal-mart to provide better health insurance coverage, with the specific intent of getting wal-mart employees off of the welfare rolls!  That is extremely powerful stuff and may serve as a template for other states.  As such, wal-mart critics are part of a political movement and not mere consumer or labor advocates.

I think that wal-mart is at a turning point.  It can either listen to critics and begin to change policies that were designed for a particular place and time - when it was a mid-west company in rural southern areas, where its policies fit and were genuinely appreciated - and now has become a global superpower on a vastly different scale.  Or it can adopt a bunker mentality, leavened by a purely public relations strategy, that is, dismissing its critics' arguments as unfair and attempting to address them solely by spin.

With these observations in mind, I would recommend this film - with caution.",1137110400,,5511,4.901939655172414
2440884,2,B000BTH4K4,"I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary, but I felt unsatisfied after watching. The film validly criticizes illegal employment practices such as failure to pay overtime wages, gender and race discrimination in promotion, and illegal interference and intimidation with union organizing efforts.

On the other hand, I found myself unsympathetic to many of the main premises of the film. Is it really fair for an unskilled worker to expect to earn more than $1-2 dollars above minimum wage? Is it really fair for an unskilled worker to expect to own a car, pay rent, and raise children on their wages, particularly if they are a single parent/wage-earner?

One of the characters in the film was a young man who finished high school and began working in the Tire/Lube shop at Wal-Mart. He complained that he could not afford to live on his own, but the filmmaker did not question why he didn't try to continue his education or obtain advanced technical training to become a skilled licensed mechanic and earn more money. The filmmaker took it as a given that everyone in America deserves a middle class standard of living, regardless of their education or job skill level. In a global economy, this is ridiculous. Unskilled workers are paid low wages in EVERY country. Just because they live in the U.S., doesn't make them special. There's a certain naive sense of entitlement throughout the film. Much of this stems from the history of unskilled or semi-skilled labor up until the 1980s. Until then, unskilled Americans could readily find manufacturing jobs that paid middle-class wages. The situation has changed over the past 25 years. There is no longer a demand for unskilled labor, or at least no one's willing to pay much more than minimum wage for this work. The filmaker of this documentary has somehow missed this point.

This film also suffers from a lack of context or comparison to other companies which employ unskilled workers. Are workers without any trade, profession, or valuable job skills treated any better at fast food restaurants?

Despite the aforementioned shortcomings, the film does an excellent job of illustrating the fallacy of tax abatements and municipal and state business incentives. This often results in ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"".  Most town councils are not skilled enough in accounting and economics to be able to make reasoned decisions about the cost/benefit of subsidizing businesses.

I would have liked to see more attention to possible solutions for the healthcare or town planning problems raised in the documentary. Ironically, even the Wal-Mart detractors in the film seem blinded by their neo-con ideology and seem unable to imagine alternatives without resorting to the knee-jerk disclaimer ""Not that I'm communist, but ...""  Such narrow minded thinking has successfully prevented desirable solutions such as single-payer healthcare, state-wide equal school funding etc. This segues into my final comment about this film... don't blame corporations for problems created by poor state and local governance.",1136937600,,3068,5.198380566801619
2440885,5,B000BTH4K4,"Most of the previous critiques on this movie were based on its quality.  I'm basing all of my judgments solely on content. I'm just an average everday person that was familiar with some of the issues of WalMart based on what I heard on the news. I have also witnessed closures of some of the ""Mom & Pop"" organizations in my own community due to big corporations moving into town and squeezing out the little guy.  I also have an elderly aunt that works at a WalMart in Ca. and she can't stand their company practices either.  Bottom line - don't shop at WalMart; don't go looking for employment at WalMart and don't invest in WalMart and then maybe they'll eventually rollover and die like many of the other stores that they put out of business.  I can honestly say that I will never shop there again, and I have recommended this movie to many of my friends.  Our country doesn't need another greedy organization like this destroying human dignity.  Does anyone in that Walton family have any morals at all?",1136678400,,1007,4.535911602209945
2440886,5,B000BTH4K4,"Everyone knows the story: WalMart waltzes into a small to medium-sized town, promises jobs and better shopping opportunities for everyone, secures tons of tax concessions, opens to great fanfare among local politicians and property developers, and within a year turns the former downtown area into a wasteland of shuttered buildings and ruined family businesses. But how many people know about the following:

-- That WalMart managers keep lists of places Associates could go for public assistance. As one employee was told, ""There are lots of programs out there. Use your taxpayers' dollars!"" The movie estimates that it costs American taxpayers over $1.5 billion every year to support WalMart employees.

-- That five Walton family members are in the top ten of America's richest people but give less than 1% of their wealth to charity (Bill Gates has given 58%) but over $3.2 million in political contributions in 2004 alone (one guess as to which political party).

-- That the moment the first union in a WalMart Canada store was certified, the company closed the store, claiming it was not profitable.

-- That the moment the tax abatements expired for their store in Cathedral City, CA, WalMart relocated it two miles away, just beyond the city line.

-- That there were over 27 million square feet of abandoned WalMart store space around the U.S.

-- That WalMart knew as early as 1994 from internal studies that 80% of their store crime occurred in the parking lots but has done virtually nothing to make their customers safe and, in fact, tried to hide from the courts that they had even done these studies.

-- That store managers are taught how to log onto the WalMart system under false ID's in order to change employees' reported hours so that no overtime would be paid, and that WalMart settled a law suit for $50 million for unpaid overtime in Colorado alone, and that WalMart faces similar work hour and overtime law suits in 31 states.

As Robert Greenwald's new DVD, WALMART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE (HCLP) shows in stunningly personal detail, these are just some of the real truths about WalMart, a company that preys on communities and individual lives for the sake of their profits and shareholders. Greenwald's documentary makes it abundantly clear that those shareholders are not likely to be WalMart employees - those individuals can barely afford to feed their families, let alone share in their employer's success through WalMart's stock.

Greenwald points out in one of the DVD's special features that he set out originally to build his documentary around the experiences of a single current employee. He found many who would talk to him off camera, but no one who would ""go public"" out of fear. As a result, he opted to tell many smaller stories of past and current employees (including management level people), small business owners whose family businesses were bankrupted by WalMart, community action groups who have fought WalMart, and even a customer who was assaulted in one of WalMart's unprotected parking lots. Not only do these ""little people"" stories give the documentary a human face, they also present a starkly contrasting reality to various segments of ""corporate speak"" from Lee Scott, the company's president.

Perhaps the defining moment in WALMART: HCLP comes from the experiences of Edith Arana, a black woman who worked for the company in Oxnard, CA for six years and was repeatedly praised as a future management candidate. When the day came that she asked about her future, she was told there was no place for ""people like her"" in WalMart management. ""What do you mean, people like me?"" she asked. ""Do you mean because I'm a woman, or because I'm black?"" ""Well, two out of two ain't bad,"" was the reply.

WALMART: THE HIGH COST OF LOW PRICE tells a story of corporate inhumanity, of blatant disregard for the law, the environment, civil rights, worker's rights, women's rights, and the rights and welfare of its own employees. Critics will argue that Greenwald's story is one-sided, but how else will we hear the side that can't spend millions on advertising, PR, lobbying, and lawyers? Watch this movie with your teenaged children. Encourage your high schools to have teachers show this movie (and perhaps THE CORPORATION, as well) and have the students discuss the enormous human cost from predatory and soulless profit-seeking for its own sake. Do we really want a job as a WalMart sales associate to become our country's new definition of the American working class dream?",1134864000,,4531,4.964379947229552
2440887,4,B000BTH4K4,"I gave the movie 4 stars because I think the message is important.  Even though the film is somewhat poorly made, the message comes across.  It's an all too familiar story of corporate greed, on a gigantic global scale.

Let's look at Jed's arguments point by point:

1. It is an attack on Wal-Mart for one reason and one reason only. Wal-Mart is non-union.

I certainly did not get this impression. Pro workers' rights, certainly. The movie spends only a small segment of time with Wal-Marts Union-busting.

2. It is poorly made

Yes, the film is low budget and the production values reflect this.  It also looks like it was made very quickly.  But it is still effective.

3. Wal-Mart is a world wide corporation and makes mistakes

Hard to argue with that since both points are obvious.

4. In the mind of the modern socialist/communist free enterprise is bad, you are too stupid to know what to do with your money and you will bow to what their will is no matter the cost.

I'm not sure what Jed is trying to say here...

5. If you are paying someone $2 a day to make goods but the average in their area is $1 a day, $2 is better (especially when there is no union dues demanded).

$2 a day is still slave wages, anywhere in the world, no matter how you spin it.

6. You cannot gauge poverty on income.

Funny, because that's exactly how the US government measures poverty.  People who have little or no income are usually considered poor.  That's pretty much the definition of poverty.

7. No one is forced to shop at Wal-Mart

If Wal-Mart is the only place in your town to buy essentials such as food and clothing, because they've driven out the competition, then you are forced to shop at Wal-Mart.  I've seen towns where Wal-Mart was the only store around for miles.

8. Wal-Mart puts some businesses out of business (that is the goal of business, to be the best and that angers the socialist/communist who wants to be the one who has control of who is in business, who is not and how you will spend your money).

So let's just have one company in the world, that would be great, right?  That would be the logical end result of your argument.  Some people prefer to have a choice when they shop.

9. Businesses are created because of Wal-Mart (that really angers the socialist/communist because something grew without them and that does not speak well of their ""you are too stupid to do anything without us"" cry).

What outside businesses does Wal-Mart create, other than its own stores?  The only businesses I see them creating are manufacturing business for countries like China, Honduras, Thailand, Mexico, etc etc etc.

10. Anti Wal-Mart, modern socialst/communists, etc. needs useful idiots and this is a great recruiting video for that.

Well this as good a place as any to leave the reader with their own private estimation of Jed's intelligence.

Thanks Jed.",1134345600,,2873,4.583497053045186
2440888,1,B000BTH4K4,"Just plain bad. Here are my reasons:

- The documentary has very few facts. Lots of first hand interviews, but those are more for emotional appeal than to prove a solid point.

- High school level film making. Choppy editing. Music levels are often higher than the dialogue.

- The parts (or acts) of the film (employee wages, effects on local econimics, etc,) are poorly defined. The transition from one topic to the next is rarely well executed.

This film could be good:
 - if it was shorter
 - if there was an narrator to outline the points at the very beginning. Also, use the narrator at the beginning and end of topics, or at least, a title stating the new point to be made.
 - if more effort was placed into the editing. It is a rushed job at present.

I had expected more of a critique of Wal Mart's broader economic policies and its impact on the overall American and World economies.  I also would've preferred more of an objective approach, but that's not something you can expect with Greenwald.  Instead, this was a film that pulled at your heartstrings and your raw emotions...showing scenarios of individuals ""wronged"" by Wal Mart.  Here we only see one side of the story.  Don't get me wrong, I think Wal Mart is an evil corporation that is bad for America.  They use unethical and appalling tactics that not only affect communities, their own employees and small business, but more importantly the decaying manufacturing base of the US economy.  This angle was better explored on an episode of PBS's FrontLine.

I definitely recommend the FrontLine documentary over this film.  The approach is more objective, and their end result is in my opinion a stronger indictment of Wal Mart's policies.  Greenwald takes the low road and shows nothing more than individuals who want to voice their grievances against Wal Mart.",1134086400,,1134,4.98404255319149
2440890,4,B000BTH4K4,"I was very excited about this movie.  I waited anxiously the whole week for it to finally come!  I read a review online that said that it was awful even though he was anti-Wal-Mart and I can't agree with that.  The documentary focused on so many topics, it was hard to get enough information on each of them.  I felt that the attacks on outsourcing jobs was a little bit unfair because SO many corporations are guilty of that, you'd have to pretty much make your own clothes and toys if you wanted to avoid that.

I think there should have been more focus on how wealthy the Walton family is and how when John Walton died in the plane crash, his wealth divided among 5 people was enough to put all of those 5 people on the Forbes 400 richest people list.  The movie mentioned that Lee Scott, the CEO, makes $27,000,000/year, but they don't make the connection that if Scott works 40 hours/week, he's making $13,000/hour which is how much the average full-time associate makes in a year.

I think this will make people feel differently about Wal-Mart, I know the people I watched it with are just as disgusted as I am, I do feel that a more focused and coherent plot would have been beneficial, and I would reccomend going to the movie's website to find a free showing before purchasing the DVD.",1133740800,,1294,4.434599156118144

It's not Wal-Mart that's killing small-town America, it's government regulations which were created by you Socialists who have ruined Europe and turned it into a poeverty center.  Also, the director engages in the Socialist practice of defining poverty by income rather than material conditions.  Wal-Mart improves material conditions, so it actually brings people out of poverty.

It's such a poorly made movie, you wonder if Greenwald was paid by Walmart to make those against Walmart look like idiotic, left-wing, nutjobs.

The first thing that struck me was that Greenwald's editing is horrible. I could have done a more professional job with some cheap software on my laptop. The annoying editing job makes it difficult to watch sometimes.

Next, they spend a great deal of time in the movie on H&H Hardware because they were going out of business. There was lots of dramatic footage and even tears. Come to find out, the owner of the store told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that Walmart had nothing to do with his shop going out of business. He said that his shop went out of business before Walmart even came to town. Couldn't Greenwald at least have found a real business that was being driven under by Walmart?

Another terrible part of the movie is when they get some punk teenager with tattoos and piercings that's trying to start a union at the Walmart. Yeah, that's really the face that I want people associating with the union. This guy just comes off as a total idiot and once again hurts the union more than it helps.

Then, when they're talking about Walmart's Chinese factories, the footage they got didn't seem to really reflect the terrible conditions of the sweatshops Walmart uses. If Michael Moore had made this movie, you can bet that he'd have gotten some really graphic footage of what these people go through.

Finally, probably the worst and most dishonest scene in the whole movie is when they're talking about parking lot crime at Walmart. They actually go through a list of the crimes that have been commited by people in Walmart parking lots and blame Walmart for not having parking lot security. That's rediculous. People have probably been raped and killed in the parking lot of the local mom and pop shop. Besides, how many stores other than the mall, can you think of with parking lot security?

And it is not just workers that bear the brunt of such powerful entities; communities and taxpayers are also impacted. As the documentary shows, Wal-mart has that kind of power. Originating out of the union-free South, Wal-mart enjoys immense profits made on the backs of workers, who are underpaid and must be subsidized by US taxpayers. There is no worker countervailing power to force Wal-mart to pay fair wages in their pathological pursuit of profits

The documentary is best at showing the pain of workers, small business owners, and communities at the hands of Wal-mart. What the documentary does not do is put it all in a political perspective. It was only through politics that the New Deal imposed limits on huge corporations in steel, autos, etc. Now there seems to be no willpower or much of a movement underway to curtail the most egregious policies and actions of Wal-mart.

Reviewer: Anonymous - See all my reviews

I go to Walmarts about every week since there's one right up the road from me. I have NEVER seen anyone look sad or upset there. Yes, I know it is true that they don't get payed that much, but if they were ever mad at how much they get payed, then why do they work there? Think about it, they choose to work there. No one is forcing them to but themselves.----",1132617600,,879,4.135294117647059
2440912,3,B000BTH4K4,"I just saw this film recently and yes, it is very powerful.  For anyone who hasn't been paying attention to the news  - the film's message is shocking. But for those who are aware of the criticism and claims against the company, there was nothing terribly new.

After the screening I thought, ""OK, Wal-Mart Bad. Now what?""  Another film I saw this week ""Independent America: The Two Lane Search for Mom & Pop"" answers that question.  In this film a married couple travels across the country without taking interstates and without doing business with corporate chains - what a concept!  They only do business with independent businesses.  The film was creative & entertaining while somber at the same time. Ultimately, the filmmakers realize it's up to the consumer to decide where to shop, who to support and how it helps their local community.

Incidentally, the couple snags an interview with a Vice President from Wal-Mart in Arkansas.

Both are great films but if you're looking for a deeper story and a solution of any kind, check this couple's film out.",1132444800,,1059,4.838888888888889
2440913,5,B000BTH4K4,"I had known for awhile that Walmart was a pretty unprincipled corporation, and I had considered not shopping there, but as a college student, the low prices were irresistable. No more. After seeing this movie, I don't think I'll ever be able to shop at a Walmart again. While it wasn't necessarily the best documentary ever made (high cheesiness factor) it was certainly true. Contrary to what some previous reviewers have said, I have friends and in-laws who have worked at Walmart and they can vouch for the certitude of the facts presented in this film.

The numbers and statistics speak for themselves. Why is Walmart so afraid of unions? There is no good reason for a multi-billion dollar company to encourage its employees to apply for welfare, medicaid, food stamps, etc. Support the workers and not the sickeningly wealthy Walton family. Watch this movie.",1132444800,,863,4.951724137931034
2440914,5,B000BTH4K4,"Recommend purchasing it here instead of walmartmovie dot com.  And if you don't like it, at least give it an honest rating.

Corporation (the documentary) was more informative and less focused on a single entity.

There is a serious epidemic of XX-mart type stores taking advantage of this and other countries just the same.

While were on the subject why don't we talk about who's ultimately to blame ""The consumer"".  Yes you and me and everyone who has gotten up in the middle of the night itching to buy some disposable throw away useless item that we could not live with out until tomorrow.  This story has been out long before Mr. Greenwald brought it national.  I have to respect anyone that tries to wake up the public to these atrocities good or bad.  The people have been sitting back watching the corruption of the systems we put into power for years.  This will be no different although I wish it weren't so.  The consumer will continue to make these giants larger and more profitable because of the ongoing mainstream propaganda that you and I take in everyday.  The corporate/government  sponsored media and news organizations flood every aspect of our waking lives with official reports of biased information and got to have now advertising that very few of us have a grip on what is really going on in this world.  Turn off the television and start thinking for yourselves again!  There will be a revolution in this country and abroad it is only a matter of time but it will not take place until people start to wake up!  Take a responsible stand for yourself and your country and do something about the things that oppress our civilization.  If you don't support the fact that people in foreign territories are making 17 cents an hour to provide you with a born in the USA t-shirt made in china, than don't buy it.  If you're fed up with corporations dumping toxic waste into your drinking water, write your congressmen, march on city hall, find out what these corporations sell and boycott the useless products they're distributing.  Most of these mass produced recycled products these companies sell are of very little importance to what you and I actually need to sustain a comfortable and happy existence.  All you have to do is become mindful and responsible for what you are actually purchasing and whose salary you wish to pay.

I have spent quite a bit of time forcing myself not to watch television.  The other day I decided to watch a commercial because it looked festive and in spirit with the holidays,  let me say now I'm not very susceptive to impulse buys and consider myself a fairly level headed consumer,  however before the commercial was over I had an overwhelming urge to purchase a particular light up Christmas tree ornament!!  This was one commercial, and during any given hour of television 18 minutes will be advertisement.  This number is climbing and may be even more as I type.  We need to wake up and stop being blinded by corporate sponsored America.  We all have the power to do something and I believe any step big or small can change our world.  Don't let them lead you to believe that there is nothing we can do about the way things are.  I'm not advocating living in the mountains next to a river fishing for your dinner,  all I'm writing is that we just become aware of what is going on and take responsibility for what we are doing and what we expect from corporations and this country if not the world.

2440916,5,B000BTH4K4,"I agree that the negative comments on this website were probably written by upper managment in the Walmart empire. I can also attest that these comments were written before the documentary was released to the public, on November 15th.  How would an average consumer have seen the movie before it was released?  The answer is, they didn't, the nay sayers aren't average consumers.

The documentary is well done, not sensationalized at all.  Can you stand the thought that hundreds of thousands of full time Walmart employees are on various forms of government healthcare and programs?  Can you ignore the fact that employees are constantly threatened with losing their job, if they do not work off the clock, in order to keep payroll low for Walmart?  Do you sleep well at night knowing that the Waltons donate next to nothing to local charities, even towards helping their own employees?  Do you care that they have all the government lobbyists to make sure they never pay their share of taxes, while the little store down the street pays his fair share?

Understand why Walmart has lower prices? They hire employees at a low wage ($12k per year - full time, no benefits or retirement.)  Then, they dupe them out of their full paycheck to save even more. They have their own sweatshot factories in China and other third world countries, extracting mandatory rent from employees and paying them $3 per day to work dawn to dusk.  They avoid local taxes, they disregard local businesses, in fact, driving around towns and making bets how fast the mom and pops will go out of business after the Walmart opens its doors.

It's not the poor checker at Walmart ...she's not the bad guy.  It's the owners of Walmart, the CEO of Walmart and other share holders and upper managment.

Bottom line - you cannot shop at Walmart if you there is an alternative place to shop.  It's that critical for America.",1132358400,,1893,4.749235474006116

Sad faces on the employees, an almost psychotic forced friendliness, a lowered standard of living, a welfare culture, illegal aliens everywhere.  It's hard not to shop at Wal-Mart.  I know.  I did last week.  That just shows how insiduous this company is.  I thought the film did a good job of highlighting this.",1132272000,,373,4.75
2440918,4,B000BTH4K4,"Let's say that I am an american and I opened up a small business.  Something simple.  Let's say....a toy store.

I buy all my toys in america made by toy makers in america.  These are americans working american jobs, paying taxes to america, and all around supporting the independence of being proud americans.

All of a sudden, a Wal-Mart comes to my town.  Wal-Mart also sells toys.  Toys made in other countries, by countries that give their employees as little as possible to manufacture their toys.  Wal-Mart goes to those countries to buy their low cost toy products because it will be cheaper for Wal-Mart to give our american money to them, instead of putting that money back into our own countries economy.

Hence, the end result is this. Wal-Mart screws american employees, and the american economy for it's own selfish profits.  So, since I can't sell my american manufactured toys cheaper than Wal-Mart, I guess I'll just have to go ""out of business"".  I can't compete with a company that has a secondary to maybe a nil interest in supporting america and american jobs.  Sure, they may pay alot of taxes to the big-whig beneficiaries of american government.  A small handful of ""already wealthy"" people who get to share in Wal-Mart's profits (while being asked to look the other way when negative statistics begin to reveal themselves), but still...what about jobs in america?  What about the value of an american manufactured product?  Is price more important than quality?  I guess our own government couldn't care less if we can't find jobs, just as long as they are getting to share in the big money from that one single strong financial entity.  That ""American Economy Threatening Profit Monger"" known as ""Wal-Mart"".

This may very well be the closest to the simplified truth about Wal-Mart's impact on america.  You don't need to watch a tainted documentary on a series of half-truths to know the reality of Wal-Mart's harm to america.  Just look around you.  There are people who benefit from Wal-Mart, and there are people who really lose.  Unfortunately, it's hard to see how many people really lose when you are just as guilty as I am when we go to Wal-Mart to get that ""lowest price"".  We shopper's really are the guilty ones if you want to blame someone for Wal-Mart's ""power of influence"" to the leaders of labor camps and sweat shops overseas.  We, the consumer, are contributing to the ruination of america's product-manufacturing economy.  Just think about that the next time you go to Wal-Mart.

And think about this, too:  Before you go buy that ""special toy"" at Wal-Mart for that special child that you love, think of that child overseas, who knows no real childhood, who's been forced into labor at a very young age, and who was probably screamed at or even beatened for making that ""special toy"" wrong the first time.  Christmas overseas must be just as scary to some children as Thanksgiving would be to ""live"" turkeys.

But, they're not your kids, so don't worry about it.  Those kids overseas probably have nothing better to do anyway.",1132272000,,3071,4.816443594646271

Have you noticed how the negative reviews are themselves quoting ""newspapers reviews""?  And all those ""newspapers reviews are extremely negative?  Well, it's this simple: If the newspapers print positive things about this documentary, thus endorsing negative comments on WalMart, then WalMart simply won't buy any more publicity from them, just like in my own country with the mass-market retailers.

2440938,5,B000BTH4K4,"This is Robert's most accomplished film to date, which, thankfully, ditched the talking heads for a more organic, personal, dynamic form. The film is littered with the personal stories of individuals, families, and communities adversely effected (exploited, hurt, ruined, et cetura) by Wal-mart; yet is also saturated with hard hitting facts (data, statistics, et cetura) which creates a film that is both personal, emotional and intellectual, abstract.

I have been following the criticism of Wal-mart for some time and I was suprised that there were stories and problems revealed in this film that not even I was aware of. Such as the systemic preventable violent crimes that occur in the their parking lots which ONE Wal-mart guard would prevent but which, apparently for Wal-mart, is one near minimum wage too much to pay to save human lives.

The only story that I was aware of that was not in the film was one that I read in the Nation which said that Wal-mart had been opening secret life insurance policies out on their employees (oh, I'm sorry, their ""associates"") so that in the event that someone died, Wal-mart could collect on their deaths, not to help financially support the gieving family, but to collect and keep the money all for their selves!

The film is made even more powerful by the inclusion of an ""anti narrator,"" the current CEO of Wal-mart, as well as including numerous clips from  Wal-mart commerials (propaganda pieces). After numerous testimonies from persons hurt or exploited by Wal-mart, the scene is ""commented"" on,  or, as Robert describes it, ""deconstructed,"" by the obvious lies of the CEO or the commercials. This juxtoposition reveals an awareness on the part of Wal-mart that these problems exist, but which they want erase by the generous application of heaping mounts of lies and distortions.

We all know that Wal-mart is not the only corporation guilty of horrific practices both here and abroad, but, Wal-mart is in market trend setting avant guard, it is known to everyone, it is one of the largest employers in the country, one of the largest exploiters in the world. If we are going to make changes in this country, in how we run our economy, how we treat our workers, and how we form and create our communities, then there is no better organisation to target first than Wal-mart. This film is a tool that needs to be shown far and wide, and then we need to get to work.

But for Greenwald supporters to claim that the ""other"" Wal-Mart film, ""WHY WAL-MART WORKS"" was funded by Wal-Mart (or even ""supported"" in any way), is such an obvious lie that it pales the credibility of any other statements made by Greenwald or his mob. I've seen both films, but I doubt that anyone else reporting on either of these Amazon.com feedback boards has.  The Greenwald film is well made, despite it's many factual errors, drawn largely from Greenwald's admission (on CNN's Showbiz Tonight) that he deliberately excluded anything positive about Wal-Mart in order to manipulate gullible viewers into supporting his special interest agenda.  I don't think that is the strategy of most true ""documentary"" producers, especially someone like Greenwald who famously attached Fox News for purportedly not being ""fair and balanced.""  So when Greenwald's distribution team compares the other film, ""WHY WAL-MART WORKS"" to "" Nazi propaganda film"" I find the comparison to be shockingly inappropriate and insulting.  The use human atrocities for financial gain is a deplorable act of desperate greed.  It's horribly disrespectful to the millions of people who lost their lives in the Holocaust. Honestly, Greenwald, tell your distribution mob to chill-out and remember that we're not talking about a war or killing people, we're talking about a retail store. Anyone who doesn't like Wal-Mart (or Target, or K-Mart or Costco or even Neiman Marcus) is not required to shop at those stores. By the same token, not a single one of the 1.3+million Wal-Mart employees is being held against their will as forced laborers. If you want to criticize the Galloway's film, watch it first, then comment. It has flaws, and suffers from its tight, independent budget. No, they did not have the funding support of Wal-Mart (or any ""special interest groups"" either). They made a movie about a company that has become a cultural phenomenon and part of the lives of 138-million shoppers every week. Not every cultural phenomenon is to everyone's tastes, either. It's a tribute to our society that people have the right to have their own tastes and preferences. Some people like to wear leisure suits and pay extra for goods that could be obtained less expensively. Some people like to criticize others rather than risk failure with their own efforts. But these are all rights that we have in America... the right to shop where you want, the right to pay more if you want to, the right to produce films that put forward false statements as if they were true (as in Greenwald's WAL-MART: The High Cost Of Low Price).

I agree with 90% of the points made in the film however I have to disagree with one. They seem to go out of their way to build up a couple character references from China to show why you shouldn't buy products made in China. They feature a 20 year old female that works in a Walmart supplier factory. She complains how she's always so sweaty and complains about the bad working conditions however in the only shot they have of the inside of the plant there are rows of ceiling fans. Granted they don't have A/C but there a numerous plants in the US that don't have A/C either. I wouldn't want to work in the plant but then again I'm not in her position. They also emphasize the low wages and long hours of factory work. What they don't tell you is the average per hour wage rate of jobs in the country. The reality is that the hours worked and the wage earned is probably about average for the country. Thats why US manufacturing jobs are going to China now, because they work long days for low wages and still produce a somewhat quality product. They wouldn't have the job in the first place if they were making $8 an hour. I'm not saying the overall living condition in China is good or fair but it is what it is and the world economy will take advantage of something if its availble. Anyway thats pretty much my only gripe of this great documentary.

This is a movie was Walmart does NOT want you to see - so tell all your friends!",1131235200,,481,5.426666666666667
8092261,4,B000BTH4K4,"The documentary is almost a decade old.  It shows lots of reasons to dislike Walmart.  Some ideas in this video are things I've never thoguht about - contribution to environmental pollution for example.  Tax loop holes and financial numbers are staggering to see.  After a decade we can be sure they are not improved.

Are their any reasons to like Walmart?  Does doing all of your shopping in one place save gas?  Reduce carbon footprint?  Shopping at Walmart is OK for many people.  They usually have what I need.  I'm a good steward of my money, for example I don't want to pay 20-50% more for a rake at the local hardware store when I know Walmart already has one.  However if I'm looking for a nice fresh tomato, then Walmart is not my first choice.

At the end it shows the possibilities of what people can do when they unite.  However, I know for a fact that at least 2 of the cities listed that ""stopped Walmart"" currently have a Walmart now.  So while people can effect Walmart progress at one location, the corporate giant found another within the same city.",1526342400,,1068,4.494791666666667

8092266,1,B000BTH4K4,Wal-Mart actually starts their employees off at $10 an hour not $7. They pay better than Target but no one complains about that huge chain. I do think it is sad that small businesses don't survive ( most don't in spite of a Wal-Mart). But getting republican business owners in this documentary complaining is almost funny if it wasn't sad. They just don't realize they vote for big business when they vote republican. Republicans are anti-union and so is Wal-Mart.,1491264000,,464,4.8125

8092270,5,B000BTH4K4,"I have seen many documentaries and this is in the top three for me. I know there is always two sides, but how anyone can watch this and not take pause to wonder?  I worked at Walmart, and I can tell you first hand, they don't offer benefits for six months. The reason for this is they know nobody will stay or be allowed to stay that long, and they rotate the workers out before that six month mark comes up. This way, they pay the minimum, and never have to pay for medical. I mean never.

The management gets their pay, raises, and medical. The workers just work. And if you think they don't direct you to the welfare office or have papers on hand?  Your wrong.

The money the owners have could pay a huge share of our national debt. And the way they have the chinese workers stacked up like slaves is disgusting.

This is a must see for everyone and everyone who shops at Walmart or anywhere. And then you decide for yourself what you think. I would never tell anyone what to think. Just giving my humble opinion.",1476921600,,1016,4.243523316062176
