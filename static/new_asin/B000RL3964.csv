I don't know what is going on yet and I finished the first DVD.  The Lawyer looks like a teen in mans clothing. It looks big on him.
I will watch another DVD when I a feel I can stay awake through it.",1426118400,,369,4.013698630136986

8201212,5,B000RL3964,"This show had me bawling! I have never cried so much over a show in my life, not even Titanic, I actually got tired of crying, lol. You become so engulfed in the struggles of the two main character to the point where one minute you are cheering for the ""good guy"" and the next minute you're sympathizing with the ""bad guy.""
It was just so amazing that I was literally quite obsessed for a while. This show is as close to perfection as possible. Every facet from the acting and the casting of the actors, to the pace of  the drama was exceptionally executed. I literally would have to force myself not to watch another episode if I had something important to do, because I knew that once I got started it would be near impossible to stop; the show is that addicting. There were so many  fine points about it, but one thing I think that especially needs praise is the pace of the show; Korean shows are infamous with dragging plots out, but The Devil was the fast paced and every episode and scene moved the plot along. It really was one of the best shows I have ever seen, Korean or otherwise... After watching the cinematic brilliance that is The Devil, I remembered why I fell in love with Korean dramas. This show quite literally made me believe in Korean dramas again. DAMN GOOD SHOW.",1280361600,5,1287,4.380753138075314
8201213,5,B000RL3964,"I am so happy to see this release. I hope the subtitles are good (I had a bad ""Hong Kong"" version and it was almost impossible to understand, even though I'm a veteran K-drama viewer--finally had to flee to the Internet to see it). All about murder and revenge, Lucifer is brilliantly executed and the acting is top notch. The script is tautly written, there's only one false note (an unconnected murder attempt toward the end) and that really does not take away from the drama at all. Not your typical hearts-and-flowers K-drama. Highly recommend.",1273708800,,548,4.778947368421052
8201214,5,B000RL3964,"This has got to be one of the best shows I've ever watched from any country (and believe me I've watched a lot of tv).  If you like mystery, crime dramas, thrillers of any type, there's no way you won't become addicted to The Devil.  It should be called The Puppetmaster because there are some masterful manipulations in this series.

I wholeheartedly agree with my fellow reviewer; however, I wish (s)he had not posted the d-addicts synopsis as it gives too much away.  The story hits the ground running within the first few minutes of the first episode and doesn't stop. Yes, there's a little bit of romance (Asian shows are big on their romance), but it's a very little bit.  Plus, the triangle is interesting as they are the main characters.

If you've never watched a tv show that wasn't in English, get over it and broaden your horizons!  The Devil is well written, filmed, and acted.  Don't let having to read subtitles stop you from watching a great show.",1209513600,5,963,4.590643274853801
8201215,5,B000RL3964,"This is one of my all time favorite Thriller Drama.. Although the Amazon synopsis implied it as a romance drama but it's mostly a crime / suspense drama with very little romance in it. It's not your typical eye for an eye revenge story, instead the drama focused on how revenge has a ripple affect and it's not always positive. The term of crime and punishment isn't always black and white as some of us would like to believe. The lawyer Oh Seung Ha being stabbed by the first victim's (Lawyer Kwong) son was an awesome twist, making everything come to a full circle..

This drama has a very creative plot, stylish execution, great soundtrack and I just loved the cinematography. Joo Ji Hoon has evolved a lot since Goong (not to mention he's shed few pounds and looking HOTTER than ever), Uhm Tae Woong was always a great actor so this time he did another awesome job.. Shin Min Ah is just adorable (and that woman can cry buckets)..",1186876800,6,934,4.4941176470588236
