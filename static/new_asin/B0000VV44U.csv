This is the story of an encounter between two friends in the middle of a depressing place, with not so many hopes in their minds. Thanks to Ilonas arrival everything start to move to the final conlcusion about love, live, hopes and weakneses. Fate and destiny for all of them is the main point of a story full of sepia contrasting moods. If you like to read, it would be great to buy a compilation of Alvaro Mutis stories. You can find them in a book which tittle is: ""The adventures and misadventures of Maqroll"". In Mutis novels you will always find Maqroll, a sailman, as a fundamental character.",1149465600,3,693,4.464566929133858
