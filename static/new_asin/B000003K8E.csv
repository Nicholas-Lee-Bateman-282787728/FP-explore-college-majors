7902559,4,B000003K8E,"Firstly, I fully acknowledge that Deep Space Nine was the least popular (sadly) of all the Star Trek shows among fans. It was, however, my favorite (to date) and this episode is one example of why that is so. Character development! Not just the main characters, week after week after week but in the shows last four seasons or so they developed the secondary characters (and adversaries) to have their own depth, dimensions, and drives.  For the first few seasons Rom was nothing more than Quark's moronic brother and lackey. In this episode he finally stands up for not only himself but for the other employees of the bar, defying his brother. This not only earns him the repect of his brother Quark (grudgingly), his coworkers (especially dabo girl and future wife Leta), and the fans, but gives him the realization that he can be more than just his brother's employee. Okay, I thought being named the next Grand Nagus near the show's finale was a bit too much but hey, it's good to see a nice guy finish on top. There are many other episodes and lesser story arcs in this series that evolve the secondary characters, including villians, from flat, 2-D persons to beings just as intriguing as the main ones. The other shows did not do this to the extent done here (except for maybe Guinan and Chief O'Brien on STNG). This helped keep the show from getting stale and redundant.",991699200,6,1378,4.647540983606557
