8554982,1,B00ANW0BBI,"This is was obviously copied from video tapes so the sound and picture quality are not that great.  The first segment is from ""Hard Copy"" 1991 and lasts 5 minutes.  Marina shows 5-10 fuzzy black and white photos and talks about Russian ufos.  The second segment is a very long and tiresome lecture at ""Earth Harmony Expo 1991"" by Marina in Russian with a translator summarizing in English.  Not a whole lot about ufos in this section.  No photos of ufos in this section either.  Some drawings sit on a table to Marina's left but they seem to have to do with auras, psychic phenomenon, free energy, etc.  Really all you get is Marina's ideas and views, there is no way to tell if these views are generally held by Russians or not.  The translator is really boring and hesitates often.  That combined with the video copy sound quality - it takes some endurance to listen to the Earth Harmony lecture.  I couldn't do it.",1460332800,7,917,4.503030303030303
