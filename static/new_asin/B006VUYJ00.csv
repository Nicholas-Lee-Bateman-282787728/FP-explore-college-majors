5021470,4,B006VUYJ00,"My daughter loves Scooby Doo and we have been collecting this series of video releases from Target for around $5 a piece, so the reduced price on Amazon is now at least competitive.  I wish they had more episodes - only 3 on each, but they are decent quality.  Most of them are the 'What's New Scooby Doo' era, but they do toss in a few of the oldies (depending on th dvd).  So far we have Sea Monsters, Robots, Creatures, Zombies, and Ghosts.  There is a little overlap for the more inclusive sets (there are a few with 13 and 14 shows on each out there, but they are are about $15 a Target, so the price per show is a little better, but those dvds are few and far between), but it isn't too bad.  Volume is a little lower on the really old episodes, but it is livable.",1344297600,7,770,4.072847682119205
5021471,1,B006VUYJ00,my daughter got this and she said she had them all one different dvd's she already has.  so I do not recommend this purchase for anyone REAL scooby fans.,1339286400,18,153,4.275862068965517
5021472,5,B006VUYJ00,"All of these piddling Scooby-Doo re-releases aren't worth saying much, but this one, however, is perhaps totally worth your time.  There are three ""What's New Scooby-Doo"" episodes on here: ""She Sees Sea Monsters by the Sea Shore"", ""Uncle Scooby and Antarctica"", and ""Reef Grief"".

And these episodes have one thing in common besides the gang encountering creepy sea creatures: A BIKINI-CLAD DAPHNE !!!
(OK, not that second episode on account of a two-piece isn't appropriate attire for Antarctica, although it would be something if she did.  But I digress.)

If you want a little fanservice from your favorite danger-prone redhead, then this volume seems viable for you.  Some other DVDs that have Daphne Blake in skimpy swimsuits include ""Scooby-Doo and the Legend of the Vampire"", ""Aloha, Scooby-Doo"", ""Scooby-Doo: Camp Scare"", and the first volume of ""Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated"" featuring the episode ""Revenge of the Man Crab"".  They're all worth buying for, fellas.",1331337600,8,975,5.381578947368421
