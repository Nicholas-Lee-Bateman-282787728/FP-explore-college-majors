7851070,5,6303589820,"This under-rated and unappreciated documentary is quite possibly one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life. Tom Rhodes gives us a highly enjoyable look into Vietnamese life. My favorite part is when he does the Slip 'n Slide on China Beach.

This needs to be put on DVD and marketed correctly so the masses can enjoy it.

It's amazing how many false and misleading statements one VHS cassette can contain. I don't know where to begin. I almost pressed the stop button when he was showing the people raising money for the temples and claimed that no one would fail to make a donation ""for fear of incurring the wrath of Buddha."" First, that is absolutely untrue. Most people traveling the roads of Burma don't make donations at ever temple they pass. Second, anyone with even the most basic understanding of Burmese Buddhism knows that Buddhist don't perceive the Buddha as cursing people who don't donate to temples.

 He claims that Burma had never been united all it's history. Dead wrong! True, it wasn't united for quite a bit of history, but there have been long periods when it was united. He claims that the British built Mandalay as their capitol. Totally, utterly wrong! It was built by king Mindgon when Upper Burma was still independent. I may have studied quite a bit of Burmese history and culture, but I'm not an expert. A number of claims were made that I had never heard of before, and I'm left wondering how many were true and how many were garbage.

 Most appallingly, he actually repeated the long discredited rumor that the ""Long neck"" women never remove their rings because they would suffocate if they did. That nonsense rumor has long since been discredited. His history of Burma was rambling and inaccurate. The name changes (i.e., Rangoon to Yangon and  Burma to Myanmar) were not instituted in 1962 but in 1989.

 The section on Cambodia was no better. He claims that no one survived the Teul Slung prison. That's interesting, considering that the tour guide is a survivor! According to the survivors, who are not ghosts, 7 people survived. He also give the impression that only people in Phnom Penh suffered during the Khmer Rouge era, but in reality all city dwellers and most rural folks (to a lesser extent) suffer terribly. But get this: at one point he says that the first westerners to enter Cambodia came less that 100 years ago. A few minutes later he mentions French explorer Henri Mouhot and states that he found Angkor in 1861. This film was made in the 1990's, do the math!

 His bad pronunciation of Burmese and Cambodian words can be forgiven, but pronouncing some words in 2 or 3 different ways can't be. Not can his poor choice of some words, such as describing a statue of the Buddha as an ""Idol.""

 I don't know a lot about Viet Nam, but I took that part of the tape with a block of salt.

 He was effective in capturing the quietness and kindness of Burmese and Cambodian people, as well as the suffering of the Cambodian people. The scenery is lovely, but I'd suggest pressing the mute button before watching it.",1104451200,5,2906,4.63035019455253
7851072,5,6303589820,"Now-a-days it may be hard to fathom, but their was a time when people got fed up with being 'governed' and wanted to gain greater freedom. They took on Goverment and sometimes they actually won. Great video, great reminder of the importance of fighting for what you believe in , even if it means losing everything you have, because without basic freedom life is not liveable.

7851073,5,6303589820,"Martin Sheen does an outstanding job of narrating the journey through Burma, Cambodia, and Vietnam. He takes us where we can not go on our own.  This documentary is a total eye opener to cultures that we learn little  about in the mainstream press.  It makes one appreciate what advanced  civilizations once existed in this part of the world, and how the people  now manage their lives despite oppressive governments.  This video is a  must see.  It will make the viewer want to experience the Burmese and Khmer  cultures first hand. Outstanding footage of Angkor Wat is shown.",940464000,20,577,4.8061224489795915
