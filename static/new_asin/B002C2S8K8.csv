8362930,3,B002C2S8K8,Terrible video quality - camera work is a joke - video is blurry (very VHS like). The audio track is good. The band's performance is awesome! A must have for King Crimson fans - if you can deal with the visuals.,1285804800,,211,4.170731707317073
8362931,3,B002C2S8K8,"Well, also an old King Crimson fan, seen them live many times, etc.. This DVD has great sound in 5.1, but I tried it on 3 different DVD players and on all it was awfully blurry. I loved it anyway, but was disappointed that the visual images were so poor. Looks like an old VHS tape played on an old VHS player, burned on to DVD.",1279497600,,328,3.984848484848485
8362932,5,B002C2S8K8,"This is a re-release of King Crimson's ""Live In Japan"", at the Nakato Sun Plaza 1995. It is the ""double trio"" composed of Adrian Belew, Robert Fripp, Tony Levin, Trey Gunn, Bill Bruford, and Pat Mastelotto. This is a live DVD in widescreen, and Dolby stereo/5.1 digital. With 19 tracks it is an excellent view into KC during those ""THRAK"" days, and an enthusiastic audience earns our envy. This is not the Ed Sullivan show and the video shows unexpected colors and backgrounds. My favorite version of ""Red"" is played here, and the band looks SO powerful on it. This may be the concert on a previous release, ""Deja Vroom"". There is simple navigation here, you just turn it on and it runs for 101 min. If you don't have any KC video I strongly recommend this. The cuts are intense and extremely well played.",1258329600,4,805,4.558620689655172
