3667847,5,B001KP2YB2,Different from the book but enjoyed it very much.,1414022400,,49,4.555555555555555
3667848,4,B001KP2YB2,"Little bit of mystery in addition to romance, was interesting. Liked the story.",1412208000,,79,5.153846153846154
3667849,4,B001KP2YB2,"Good book, someone should make a movie out of it with nothing added and nothing removed.  She did not seem his type nor he hers. But then those make the best romances. i didn't blame her from running from him he seemed so domineering and untrusting. Romance is easier when the people are mature enough to accept each other for who they are and let nature take it's course.",1406073600,,372,4.391304347826087
3667850,4,B001KP2YB2,"It has a mystery to it, I liked the story line and the fact the brother seemed be kind of a hard nose but was sensitive and really loved his brother. I think this was a great movie and I will watch it again!",1398297600,,207,3.727272727272727
3667851,5,B001KP2YB2,I saw this movie a few years ago and have always wanted to own it and when I found it on Amazon I ordered it. Nick Mancuso is a real delight in this. I love his character.,1378857600,2,171,3.6486486486486487
3667852,1,B001KP2YB2,"I am almost done watching the movie version of one of my favorite Linda Howard books ""Loving Evangeline."" How could Linda Howard allow her book to be changed almost 100 percent into this piece of trite? Robert and Evie should be good looking. Robert Cannon is portrayed by a middle aged actor with a paunch and graying balding hair. Evie is sexless as portrayed by the actress. Other than his suspecting her of selling his companies software there is nothing else remnicent of the plot. I am giving this DVD away to someone when I finish it. It stinks. I recommend the book to all for a great love story though.",1262822400,12,611,4.513513513513513
3667853,1,B001KP2YB2,"The book, Loving Evangeline, is a wonderful, love story.  The movie was a disaster.  I couldn't believe what they did to it.  Robert was as handsome and sexy as a dish rag. In the book, he was a great character. So was Evangeline.  They completely changed the story.

I was so disappointed.  I loved the book.  How could Linda Howard allow them to do that to her work.",1249084800,8,368,4.323529411764706
3667854,4,B001KP2YB2,"I now own all the Harlequin romance movies with this purchase and hope in the future there will be more.  Canadians really know how to portray romance in their movies. This movie was not my favorite of the Harlequins, but still great to have it in my library and will watch it again. (I did give it 4*s)  Also, as in the other Harlequins I have reviewed, the story line is not boring and the interest for me comes from the romance and mystery twists and turns from the beginning of the movie until the end. Oh BTW neither of the people on the cover of the DVD box are the actors in this movie!",1243036800,7,593,4.147826086956521
8315729,5,B001KP2YB2,"First of all, I never read the novel but I did enjoy the movie.  Yes, it was a middle-age bachelor who found the love of his life ....a smart and nice looking over-30 yr old lady.  I guess some reviewers  wanted them to be 20-25 years old and her a sex-kitten....maybe that was in the book.  The mystery plot was great and I love the filmography with the seaside town and his house.  I have become a fan of  Nick Mancuso.",1518912000,,421,4.135802469135802
8315730,1,B001KP2YB2,"Terrible. It's nothing like the book. Ugh. Not even worth reviewing. Yes, it's that bad. Harlequin didn't do justice by Linda Howard's book. This is such a wonderful novel too.",1512518400,,176,4.9
8315731,1,B001KP2YB2,"Way to completely ruin a good story... I love Linda Howard's novel. The movie is terrible. The romance in the book is smokin hot, these characters have ZERO chemistry. Zero. It's brutal to watch. Don't waste your time.",1510444800,2,218,4.7631578947368425
8315732,1,B001KP2YB2,"The only thing similar to the book was the marina setting. Okay for a cheesy harlequin romance movie, but a big disappointment because its nothing like the book which is a classic and great Linda Howard novel.",1509840000,,209,4.675675675675675
8315733,2,B001KP2YB2,"It wasn't so  bad that I had to turn it off, but it wasn't very engaging. Nor did the main characters seem to have much chemistry which in my opinion is a must with a romance movie.",1508544000,,181,3.891891891891892
8315734,2,B001KP2YB2,"Only because I mellowed since I saw the movie, do I give it even, 2 stars? If I had to hear Nick Mancuso [I don't even remember the character's names] say I'm sorry, one more time, I was going to have to wait a few days before watching the rest of it. His glasses are the worst! He's supposed to be a good guy at the beginning and he looked shifty-eyed, way too early? Some of the dialogue, in places was decent. I can't say that for much of what Mancuso had to say. He's like a made-over adult male figure whose genesis into childhood began in the 1970's trying too hard to impress, to show he's sensitive. Yuk! At your own risk, watch it, I mean, watch it, you'll be disappointed, but we should all be, sometimes!",1506470400,,715,4.188405797101449

8315737,1,B001KP2YB2,Not worth watching... the other Harlequin movies were much better.  Not really a romance per se.,1505779200,2,96,5.0
