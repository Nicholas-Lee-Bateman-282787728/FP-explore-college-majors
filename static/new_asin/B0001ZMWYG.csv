2046438,3,B0001ZMWYG,We purchased this dvd set since a boxed set with all 3 seasons was unwatchable - stopping in the middle of several episodes.  This one (Season 1 only) was much better - though still not perfect.  We bought the Season 2 dvds from amazon.com later.  Those dvds were worse than the Season 1 ones (but better than the boxed set).  We're now watching the series on MeTV.  The episodes on MeTV also have better color.,1501804800,2,411,4.426666666666667

The pilot alone is worth the price of the set, it is like a Mel Brooks/Stephen Speilberg slapstick farce.  The supporting cast is fabulous with Kenneth Mars doing his marvelous over the top German and Henry Gibson is great as his assistant and American spy.  Cloris Leachman chews the scenery to bits as Diana's mother Hippolita.  This show should be a period comedy classic.  Through it all Linda Carter strides as earnest and upright as Christopher Reeve in the first Superman.  A joy and a wonder to behold.",1499644800,3,587,4.650485436893204

2046450,1,B0001ZMWYG,"I'm probably the only person who cares about this (for a show like Wonder Woman, at least), but just in case there's someone else out there interested in purchasing this series who cares about aspect ratios:

The original series was filmed and broadcast in the 1.33 aspect ratio, like all 20th century television series were. On a modern widescreen television, anything filmed in this ratio will display in the center of the screen with large black bars/columns at the right and left sides of the image (or you'll get a distorted image that's been stretched horizontally to fill the entire screen, if your TV is set that way).

The DVD sets of this series are presented in the proper 1.33 aspect ratio. But Amazon's streaming version actually crops off a large portion of both the top and bottom of the original image in order to fill the available space on a modern television. In effect, what you get is a ""zoomed in"" portion of the original image, resulting in the loss of something like 25% at the top and bottom (I haven't done the math because I suck at it, so this is a rough estimate).

I purchased the streaming versions of all three seasons earlier today, but when I started up the first episode of season one and realized right away that the image was butchered, I immediately went looking for a refund. I was able to get a refund for seasons two and three because I hadn't played any of those episodes yet, but I was unable to get a refund for season one because I had played one lousy minute of one episode. Which was the only way I could have even known there was a reason to seek a refund, since there's no mention on Amazon's store page that the streaming version is not in the original aspect ratio.

Once I realized I was stuck with season one, I jumped ahead to several other random episodes to see if they were all butchered in the same way. They are. So if you want to see all of the original image, stay away from Amazon's streaming version.",1493683200,78,1963,4.444444444444445

2046489,4,B0001ZMWYG,"Being a fan of the gold and silver age of comics, I always appreciate a period piece. The entire Wonder Woman series starring Lynda Carter was not perfect, but at least we got to see, for the first time, a live-action Wonder Woman, treated with relatively no camp. I liked the innocence of the first season, set during World War II. It was, and remains, a reminder of a different world, where patriotism was clearly defined. I believe the essence of who Wonder Woman is, a champion for all, and faith that even enemies would some day become brothers and sisters, was well represented through Lynda Carter. Subsequent seasons, moved from ABC to CBS, were less interesting, with poor scripts and heavy handed dialogue, still portrayed a robust and worldly heroine. Lynda Carter set the standard against all others who might portray Wonder Woman would be measured. A difficult task indeed. The Wonder Woman tv series is like the joke about sex, chocolate and pizza. When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad... it's still better than nothing.",1469404800,3,1049,4.833333333333333

2046545,4,B0001ZMWYG,"Enjoy this show for what it is: ""Adventure - Action"" ...and comedy!  I grew up in the 70's watching Wonder Woman right along side I Dream of Jeanie, Bewitched, The Dukes of Hazard, The Jeffersons, The Brady Bunch, Get Smart, Happy Days and many more.  I think because of my age and the very beautiful Lynda Carter, my memories of Wonder Woman were much more fantastic than realistic.  Watching the pilot again after 30 years, it is clear that this series fits the times. Main title actors, serious about their trade, made the most of ridiculous and unbelievable scripts.  Take the plots, with holes as big as the Bermuda Triangle, guest stars with forehead slapping, mostly comedic performances, and so-called ""action sequences"" with a grain of salt (don't believe me? Watch the Wonder Woman versus Marsha ""fight"" near the end of the pilot). Enjoy Lynda Carter & Lyle Waggoner's acting, and the fact that Wonder Woman was on TV for three whole years.",1445644800,,950,4.809815950920245

Flippers are unreliable technology that renders discs often unplayable.  And such was the case with Disc 3 Side 2.  Flippers are only used by DVD manufacturers to reduce costs.  Instead of having to produce 2 discs and the storage space for 2 discs, they can cut costs by using flippers for a single disc.  However, this cost cutting costs the buyer because the product quality is inferior and prone to easy damage.

So, how can I review the contents of the release when some of them aren't playable?

Avoid.

It's enlightening to look back on this, and see how television sought to address the cultural changes with this show - and others like the Bionic Woman (which I also watch regularly back then).  As a nine-year-old girl I didn't realize how incredibly sexist the show was, yet, for its time it was still a huge step forward, showing women as powerful, intelligent problem-solvers.  We downloaded this seasonafter our daughter asked about Wonder Woman.  She adored the pilot episode (as did I as a girl - it was always my favorite) and later loved acting out stories where she pretended to be WW, bullet-reflecting-bracelets and all.

2046795,5,B0001ZMWYG,"The season 1 (aired on ABC) is generally considered the best of the series and the only one featuring Wonder Woman during the WWII era true to the comic book.

This show is surprisingly entertaining. Yes, the storyline is cheesy (it is based on a comic book after all), much of the special effects look dated by today's standards, and the characters are mostly superficial. Yet the series shines with the charm of Lynda Carter in her prime (she was only 24-25) and the series never takes itself too seriously.

Lynda Carter, who grew up as an avid reader of Wonder Woman comic books, was the perfect Wonder Woman. Yes, she is beautiful, but she also has that right mixture of feminine beauty mixed with physical intimidation that was so right for Wonder Woman. I also noticed that she had a very feminine and beautiful smile to go along with beautiful feminine voice (but not too high pitched). Make no mistake, Wonder Woman is a marvelous feminine woman first and uses force only when it is necessary. A Terminator she is not.

Lynda Carter also gives Wonder Woman a strong physical presence. In the first episode, check the first fight scene against the bank robbers and how she prepares against men shooting guns at her.

No wonder producers had a very hard time finding an another actress to play Wonder Woman, very few can play her.",1305331200,3,1337,4.6525423728813555

Not to be deterred, I decided to stop in here at amazon to see if it was available..lucky for me, it is!

WOW...I just about choked on my popcorn & strawberry Fanta!), and the special effects are, uhm, not really so special, but it really took me back to a simpler time when reality tv was not the norm as it appears to be today!

2046806,5,B0001ZMWYG,"If each decade of television had a 'defining' super-hero series (George Reeves' 'Superman' in the '50s, Adam West's 'Batman' in the '60s), Lynda Carter's 'Wonder Woman' was certainly the '70s series, and, in many ways, ""Wonder Woman - The Complete First Season"" is one of the best comic book adaptations to ever appear on the small screen. Taking a major risk by setting the action in WWII (when the character was first introduced in print), after a campy few episodes (aired on television as one-hour 'specials'), the level of silliness was reduced, and a sophistication introduced that makes the season still entertaining, over thirty years later.

Much of the credit for the series' success must go to the extraordinary Ms. Carter; buxom and statuesque, she 'filled' the bullet-bra costume astonishingly well, yet more importantly, she possessed innocence as well as beauty, and her dazzling smile succeeded in keeping the character 'family-friendly', despite the provocative garb. Add to this her impressive acting skills, and you had an ideal spokesperson for feminists, sincere but non-threatening. As with Reeves and West, in her 'alter ego', Navy Yeoman Diana Prince, she displayed little difference in characterization from her 'Wonder Woman' persona, relying on glasses and hairstyle to 'fool' her co-workers; while this strains credibility, it was actually done for the audience's benefit, to simplify things for viewers unfamiliar with the comics.

Carter's co-star, Lyle Waggoner, as boss and friend, Major Steve Trevor, is also remarkably good in his role, if a bit stereotyped in the 'heroic' mold. Wisely, the producers gradually eliminated the romantic subtext of their relationship (saying it was difficult to sustain, in a weekly series); scenes of her dreamily gushing on about how ""wonderful"" he was never rang true, and seemed awkward, at best. In able (if superficial) support, Richard Eastham (as Trevor's War Department boss), and Beatrice Colen (as Prince's 'Plain Jane', romantically frustrated co-worker), provided stability, and additional 'grounding' for the WWII era.

While the wartime setting would ultimately prove too limiting (with the Nazis over-used as the weekly villains...weren't we fighting the Japanese and Italians, as well?), and subsequent seasons would move the action to present-day, first-season writers did attempt to come up with unique 'spins' on standard comic book plots (a ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" alien visit, machines to create earthquakes, Pavlovian experiments to create a gorilla 'hit' man, etc.), and the time period did provide some novel scenarios (a plot to steal cattle intended for the army...guest-starring legendary Roy Rogers...and another episode involving a jet plane prototype). Certainly, the most talked-about episodes featured young Debra Winger, at the start of her career, as Wonder Girl, Diana's baby sister (with the wonderful Carolyn ""Addams Family"" Jones as the Amazon Queen).

As a whole, ""Wonder Woman - The Complete First Season"" is a lot of fun, at a really terrific price, and a great introduction to the series and it's irreplaceable star!",1241136000,5,3129,5.445360824742268
2046807,4,B0001ZMWYG,"Way to go Warner Bros. for bringing Wonder Woman's 1976-77 Season out on DVD, since I can finally get to see each of these episodes complete & uncut without any deleted scenes that we'd always get watching the reruns on MeTV, the Sci-Fi Channel, FX, and in syndication.

This was also the season when WONDER WOMAN was on ABC before the show had moved to CBS in the remaining 2 seasons as well as the season when Diana Prince(Lynda Carter) and Maj. Steve Trevor(Lyle Wagner) worked for the Navy and when Gen. Blankenship(Richard Eastham) was their superior officer, which was of course before the days when Diana & Steve worked for the IADC in Washington, D.C., plus I noticed Wonder Woman's uniform was a little different than it was in the 2nd and 3rd Seasons, including her bracelets, since her bullet proof bracelets were baby blue in this season, but were gold in the last 2 seasons.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Gretchen Corbett in the ""Wonder Woman Vs. Gargantua"" episode during her co-starring days as Jim Rockford's sexy attorney girlfriend(Beth Davenport) on THE ROCKFORD FILES

*Tim O'Connor in the ""Judgement From Outer Space"" episode before his co-starring days as Dr. Huer on BUCK ROGERS

*John Hillerman in the ""Wonder Woman Vs. Gargantua"" episode before his co-starring days as the often exasperated Higgins on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Dick Van-Patten in the ""Beauty On Paradise"" episode before his co-starring days on EIGHT IS ENOUGH

*Award winning(John Saxon) in the ""Feminine Mystique"" episode known for his co-starring role as Nancy's whacko father(Lt. Donald Thompson)in Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET

*Eric Braeden in the pilot episode before his co-starring days as Victor Newman on THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS

*Henry Darrow in ""The Bushwackers"" episode before his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA and after his co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL

*Debra Winger as Wonder Woman's/Diana Prince's kid sister from Paradise Island in the ""Feminine Mystique"" episode before Debra Winger was even a star

*Edmund Gilbert in the ""Wonder Woman Meets Baroness Von Gunther"" episode before his co-starring days as Fenton Hardy on THE HARDY BOYS

Something else I noticed about this season of WONDER WOMAN was quite a few episodes were directed by actor(Stuart Margolin)best known for his role as private dective Jim Rockford's hustling ex-con buddy(Angel Martin)on THE ROCKFORD FILES, but for some reason Stuart Margolin never came out as a guest star on WONDER WOMAN throughout this shows entire 3-year run.",1239840000,6,2541,5.113526570048309
2046808,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Oh...to be a boy back in the 70's again, life was so simple. Boys didn't get too much to ogle at on TV, but then came Wonder Woman! Farrah may have been every man's sweetheart, but Lynda Carter was every boys fantasy!  The well endowed brunette had me tuning in every week! The show was campy, but nobody cared. It's was all about watching the buxom beauty run around in that satin outfit.

Watching the show now, it does seem a bit silly and not as much fun as the Hulk(at least in the episodes I've watched so far), but Lynda still looks good in that tight patriotic suit, although that star spangled bottom looks more like granny pants! lol..... Hey don't get me wrong, she fills the outfit nicely! The episodes on this first season set look pretty clean and uncut and there are a few cool extra to go through.

I'm sure women who were girls back then have a different recollection of this show because not many shows featured a strong woman role model as the star.  The set is well worth picking up for fans!",1238630400,2,1012,4.338624338624339
2046809,5,B0001ZMWYG,"After doing a previous TV movie pilot based on DC Comics ""Wonder Woman"" that aired on ABC which stared Cathy Lee Crosby as Wonder Woman and had Ricardo Montalban as the villain.  They chose to make ""Wonder Woman"" more like ""The New Wonder Woman"" in which ""Wonder Woman"" had given up her Amazon powers and had become more like a take off on Emma Peal of the 1960's TV series, ""The Avengers.""

In this pilot, Princess Diana gives up her Amazon heritage to go off to Man's World to fight injustice.  She works for the U.S. Government.  Steve Trevor is her supervisor.

ABC did not pick up this pilot for a regular TV series, so the producers went back to the drawing board to do a new TV pilot.  This time, they decided to go back to the original concept of the Wonder Woman character and the original series from the 1940's which took place back in the days of World War II deciding to be true to the original comic book series to retile the series ""The New Original Wonder Woman.""

Beauty contest winner Linda Carter was selected to play the role of ""Wonder Woman.""  Lyle Wagner was selected to play ""Major Steve Trevor,"" ""The American War Hero.""  Lyle Wagner was once selected as a back-up to Adam West for the role of Batman in the 1966 TV series.  Executive Producer William Dosier wrote that he was set onAdam West, but TV networks lke to be given an option.  Lyle Wagner later went on to appear as a regular for the first few seasons on the ""The Carole Burnette Show.""

This series proved successful, however, ABC did not run the series regularly under a regular day and time slot.

The TV movie pilot is great which also has Cloris Leachman as Hypolite, Queen of the Amazon's and Princess Diana's (Wonder Woman's) mother.  It also has as villains in it, Artie Johnson from ""Laugh-In"" and Fanny Flag.

The character from the original comic book series, Etta Candy also appears in it with an added character, Steve Trevor's superior officer, General Blankenship.

The script for the TV movie pilot was written by Lorenzo Deple, Jr. who also wrote scripts for the 1966 Batman TV series.

Lorenzo Semple, Jr. had originally written to TV movie script as campy.  However, fortunately, the producers decided that they did not really want to go the way of the 1960's ""Batman"" TV series and edited the script removing a number of jokes from it to Lorenzo Semple, Jr.'s dismay.  The result was a TV movie done in a tongue-in-check manner like the early episodes of the 1960's series, ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."" were done.

There are some episodes in the First season that guess stars actress Debra Winger as Drusilla, Wonder Woman's younger sister, ""Wonder Girl.""

For classic those who are also classic western fans, Roy Rogers also appears in once episode as an owner of a ranch that has a government contract to provide beef for the military.  Steve Trevor and Diana Prince are sent down there to investigate Nazi espionage activities sabotaging the ranch owner's operations.

In the first series, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor go up against  a lot of Nazi spies and Nazi officers up to no good just like the superheroes of the 1940's used to do in the Golden Age of comics.

Actor John Saxton also appears in a  two-part episode as a ruthless Nazi officer bent on finding the place where Wonder Woman came from in hopes of securing the special indestructible metal that Wonder Woman's bracelets are made of.  Debra Winger appears in this two-part episode as ""'Wonder Girl"" who ends up being captured by John Saxton's character and his fellow Nazis who manage to extract from her the secret location of Paradise Island in which they now plan to launch an attack on to take it over for the glory of Nazi Germany.

If you like the original Wonder Woman from the 1940's and/or just like the Golden Age superhero stories written in the 1940's during World War II, then you'll enjoy the First Season of ""The New Original Wonder Woman.""

The other two seasons were picked up by and aired on CBS.  Wonder Woman returns to Man's World in present day to work as a government agent under the supervision of the son of Steve Trevor, Steve Trevor, Jr. also played by Lyle Wagner.  This was attempted to be done on a more serious note and basically was supposed to be CBS's answer to ABC's successful running TV series at the time, ""The Six Million Dollar Man.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B0006Z2KZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman - The Complete Second Season</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Woman-The-Complete-Third-Season/dp/B00080ZG2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Woman - The Complete Third Season</a>

I watched WW growing up, and when I heard it was coming to DVD, I couldn't contain my excitement.  As cheesy as it was, I loved rewatching the show.  Lynda Carter as WW still stands the test of time.  Whenever I hear talk of a WW movie, and names thrown around as to who would play her, I just shake my head with disgust with each name.  Can I share a secret with you?  I have one person in mind, which will probably start a possible outrage...but I think the one person I can see playing WW now...Lucy Lawless.

2046823,5,B0001ZMWYG,"The pilot is worth the price of the ticket alone.  Saw this with some friends who'd actually never seen Wonder Woman before, and to tell the truth, I'd never seen the pilot.  Glorious really.  Since then I've seen episode 1 and yes it did fall quite a few notches below what we'd seen.  Though I never mind seeing Wonder Woman running around in the background whatever else may be happening.  I should watch more episodes before reviewing this product I suppose, although after getting this first season for around 13 dollars including shipping, and having as much fun with the pilot as I did, I'd say I got my money's worth already - the rest is bonus, be it good or bad.. and I can also say that although the first episode did fall noticably short of the pilot, it did get better toward the end of the show, and I'll be watching episode 2 tomorrow.

Addition:  While the first episode (not the pilot) is lukewarm, the 2nd and 3rd episodes get progressively better, indeed this is eye-candy!  The series is again peaking with the 2-part Episode 4 ""The Feminum Mystique"" in which Wonder Woman's cute younger sister, Drusilla, makes her appearance.  Seems the Nazis are interested in the mysterious metal that Wonder Woman's bullet-deflecting bracelets are made of - metal which can only be obtained on Paradise Island.  Paradise Island once again lives up to it's name as we return to the land of the naive-yet-powerful Amazonians.  And the Wonder Woman series is beginning to impress me all over again!

2046824,4,B0001ZMWYG,"Wonder Woman is known in the comics world as one of the big three of DC Comics along with Superman and Batman.

  With the current popularity of the Amazon princess in DC Comics as the hero who will cross the line by killing, it's a perfect time for a DVD release of the 70's television series.

  Wonder Woman was originated by William Moulton Marston, a lawyer and psychologists whose work was instrumental in the creation of the polygraphi (lie-detector) machine and originally debuting in comic books in 1941.

  Where Superman and Batman have gone through many actors, Wonder Woman will be remembered for the woman who played the character which was former Miss USA Lynda Carter.
  With the search for the right woman, Lynda Carter was the perfect person for the job.  Tall, beautiful, buxumous and literally the girl next door, no matter how campy the storylines were at the time, male audiences loved watching Lynda Carter and female audiences were inspired by the positive, strong female role that Lynda Carter portrayed in the Wonder Woman series

  In the first season pilot which aired Nov. 1975 on ABC, the show centered around the WWII era as pilot Steve Trevor (played by Lyle Wagonner) who  narrowly escaped death from gun shots from a nazi pilot.

  Landing in Paradise Island, inhabited by only women, Diana Prince rescues the pilot, nurses him and is chosen to bring the injured pilot back to the US and later help America defeat the evil nazi regime.

  Upon watching the episodes, I was amazed at how campy the series was.  From the storyline, fighting sequences to the special effects.  It's amazing to see how far special effects on television has evolved in the last 30 years.

  The video (4:3), surprisingly for a 70's television show, looks good.  Audio is presented in mono.

  As for special features, the pilot episode commentary with series executive producer Douglas S. Cramer and Lynda Carter features a lot of behind-the-scenes information on the series.

  But what made it much more enjoyable was to listen to the two in awe for not having seen the pilot for nearly 30 years.

  Also, very fun to watch was the documentary Beauty, Brawn and Bulletproof Bracelets: A Wonder Woman Retrospective featuring Lynda Carter, Douglas S. Cramer Alex Ross and many more.

  You really got to learn how many celebrities wanted to have a guest appearance on the series.  How the spinning transformation and the sparking bracelets came about.  How Wonder Woman was supported by women and feminists to Debra Winger's role as Wonder Girl.  And much more.

  Watching Wonder Woman sure has brought a lot of memories and watching it decades later was still fun and enjoyable.

  Definitely recommended for fans of the series and fans of Wonder Woman.  It's a fun, yet campy series from the 70's,  made even more enjoyable on DVD with the commentary and documentary.  Check it out!",1220400000,2,2897,4.8559670781893

2046826,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Having just watched the season one pilot for the first time in years, I've come to a much better understanding of many things.  Firstly, Lynda Carter's is a genius performance, and I do NOT use the word lightly.  Secondly, the film-makers achieved a camp masterpiece.  Camp must be carefully distinguished from kitsch.  Camp is NOT the enjoyment of badness.  Camp is, like the Roxy Music aesthetic, a realm of true art which exists always on the razor's edge between humor and seriousness.  Camp is neither truly humorous nor truly serious: it is something other, something more.  Somehow, when last I watched this episode a few years ago, I was unable to understand its true intent.  That is, I had not yet fully assimilated the camp aesthetic, even though I've unwittingly grooved to that aesthetic in Roxy Music for decades.  Yes, decades.  Tonight has been a revelation.  The Wonder Woman camp aesthetic is dizzyingly high.  This film is equal in artistic value to the best films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.  And that is saying an awful lot.  It also doesn't hurt that Lynda Carter, like Marilyn Monroe, is incapable of not being fetching on film.  It is impossible to find a single un-comely frame.  Lynda Carter, wherever you are, thank you.  Thank you. Your performance will resound through the eons.
By the way, I believe Lynda Carter's interpretation of Wonder Woman as a child-woman is so pitch-perfect that no improvement is possible.  Looking at stills of Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman, with her living-doll face and wide child eyes, one hears delicate and inevitable music playing inside of her, as though her sensitive and yet slightly adrift mind could be expressed by a Mozart piano sonata.
Therefore, in any upcoming movie version, Lynda Carter should play Wonder Woman.  Also, as a further aside, it is quite interesting to watch Lynda Carter's performance as Diana Prince.  If one examines the matter closely, as I have, it becomes clear that Diana Prince is a fictional character that Wonder Woman has created as her disguise.  That is, Diana Prince's personality is NOT AT ALL the same as Wonder Woman's personality.  Diana Prince's personality is Wonder Woman's approximation of a normal American female.  This personality is somewhat shallow, though well-intentioned, and quite subservient to men: Steve Trevor is Diana Prince's boss, though the relationship between Steve Trevor and Wonder Woman usually involves Wonder Woman carrying a limp and unconscious Steve Trevor in her arms.  This may seem an obvious point, but it bears repeating, especially as it bears on Lynda Carter's performance:  Diana Prince is Wonder Woman in character - pretending to be someone entirely different.
Update, 4.8.08... just having watched the episode Fausta, the Nazi Wonder Woman I can definitively report that after the pilot, the show's writing and acting - with the exception of Lynda Carter, went straight into the toilet and there seemed to remain.  The shift in quality was so extreme, so abrupt that it was almost as if some guy in a blue-gray jumpsuit with orange, conical flashlights was GUIDING the writing and acting into the toilet.  One can but empathize with Lynda Carter, who tried so valiantly to carry the show on her comely back.  HER performance - given the ludicrous writing she had to work with - was continuously very good.  Alas, but to little avail, as, after the pilot, the show's writing went from being a camp masterpiece to being geared for five-year-olds.  Seemingly some boys in the front office got their hooks into things.  One can almost hear them now, gesturing as the writing is lowered on the end of a cable, ""Lower!.... Lower!""  And then the reply, ""Lowering!""  How could they do it?!  How could they do such a thing to Lynda Carter?!  It's ungentlemanly to abuse a woman in this way.  Oh and by the way, speaking of abuse, if you can stand to watch the scene of Wonder Woman being chloroformed and then dragged limply away you're made of sterner stuff than me.  Can I get a witness?",1207267200,2,4034,4.914201183431953

2046829,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Here we have the first 13-episodes of 'Wonder Woman,' a watershed moment in television history that rather courageously portrayed a female, and above all feminist, superhero-icon true to her origins. Each storyline of this premier run is a gem. And should anyone 'wonder' why Lynda Carter is today so adored and memorable in the title role, take a look at the 2-part episode 'Judgement from Outer Space,' or better yet,'The Bushwhackers.' In both, Carter's Wonder Woman simply sparkles with kindness, empathy and sensitivity, qualities written into the character from the very beginning, in 1941, by WW's creator, William Moulton Marston, alias Charles Moulton. Television production quality of the mid-70s may seem lacking to those not of the generation who were the first to watch this landmark program, but I find it endearing that producer Douglas Cramer and his team were clearly discovering what worked best stunt- and effects-wise through trial-and-error with each passing episode. The series adapts the original WWII-era character and storylines with remarkable faithfulness -- spaceships are indeed round, silver flying saucers, exactly as they were perceived and portrayed during the 1940s when science pulp-fiction and comics were wildly popular. And costume designer Donfeld's interpretation of the famous costume is also noteworthy for its accuracy -- it's not easy to transfer a very detailed eagle emblem drawn in a comic to a costume that can be worn by an actress with convincing ease -- and he even renders WW's belt in a silvery, platinum-like tone as a respectful nod to the fact that it was originally drawn and colored white. Everything comes off with authenticity, and I agree with both Cramer and co-star Lyle Wagonner -- who is simply fantastic as Steve Trevor -- that the series was at its best when set during the WWII era. Beyond the obvious thought and care that went into these 13-episodes, the show's success should not be surprising considering its launch approached the country's bicentennial year. Patriotism was high, and who better to encapsulate that nostalgia and feeling than Wonder Woman, a modern-day 'Liberty leading the people,' wrapped in the American flag? And 'Women's Lib,' as Equal Rights for Women was then often called, was also at fever pitch. The timing was right, the talent was exceptional, and the casting of Carter utterly brilliant. I treasure this first season, and though the following seasons have their charms too, nothing compares to these thirteen gleefully entertaining episodes.",1193356800,2,2543,5.281481481481482

2046840,5,B0001ZMWYG,"(4.5/5 stars)  When I bought this DVD set, I was expecting a really bad TV show from the 70s, in other words a dated series with cornball humor, bad clothing styles and mindless plots. What I found was a delightful action-drama set in World War II with some thought-provoking scripting and the absolutely captivating Lynda Carter. While the villains are clearly identified as such, what is surprising is the manner in which Wonder Woman finds the humanity in each. By attempting to understand why these people do what they do, she essentially tells us that crime is relative and that these people are only subject to acting on human instincts. There is no absolute Good and Evil in this show. We often think of Wonder Woman fighting for the United States government, but in this show she truly does fight for truth and justice, and the US does not escape scrutiny. That is to say, the US, while clearly identified as the Good Guy, is sometimes criticized for certain actions. The episode concerning Japanese internment camps from Season Two is a good example of this. (It is always Wonder Woman who analyzes the situation and, even though she is simply following the script, Lynda Carter is that much more attractive as a result)  In addition, Wonder Woman never kills the villains and uses only enough force to prevent their escape. This might come as a disappointment to some, but I found it a very refreshing approach. Instead of torturing people or beating them into submission, she uses her golden ""Lasso of Truth"" to get them to confess or provide details. I realize this came from the original comic book as well, but it very easily could have been much different in the wrong hands. There is an obvious feminism that runs throughout the series, such as Wonder Woman consistently overpowering men. However, it is treated in a way that should be acceptable by all but the most chauvinistic among us. Even though there are a couple weak episodes, there really isn't much I do not like about season one. The sets, while hardly elaborate, are believable as the 1940s. Sure, some of the effects are less than special, but that is the result of a low television budget. Episodes play like miniature, self-contained movies, which makes watching them only sporadically a good option. Also, I cannot praise Lynda Carter enough for the job she does with this role. She is so good that it seems she was born to play it. I find her to be one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen; she does a magnificent acting job and is physically imposing enough to make the superhero role seem plausible. I would watch her even if the show was not good, though the fact I find the show's content engaging makes it a favorite of mine.",1155254400,30,2722,4.66875
2046841,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Wow, what great memories this set brought back to me. I was a little kid when the series first aired in the late 70's, and I was a HUGE Wonder Woman (and Lynda Carter) fan. I watched every episode faithfully. I guess the main target audience was supposed to be female, but I didn't care. Just watching Lynda Carter run around in that star-spangled costume was pure magic. Looking back at it now, I can see the series was somewhat cheesey, and done rather tongue-in-cheek. This doesn't take anything away from it, however. Ms. Carter is wonderful in the title role, and she grew more comfortable in the part as the season went on. This first season stands apart from the other two seasons that followed, as it is the only season set in the World War 2 era, as the original comic was. This offsets the dated seventies production of the show,  giving it a somewhat timeless feel. All the episodes including the pilot are included here, and a great commentary track from Lynda Carter. The individual shows are clear, clean and the colors just glow. The sound is fresh and clear, with correct subtitling when wanted. I've watched all the episodes in the set, and again I felt like a 7 year-old boy gazing in awe at Wonder Woman deflecting bullets, picking up cars, and battling Nazis.

I had not really seen the show since it originally aired, but unlike some old shows this one does not disappoint.  The first season  holds up really well, and does not seem that dated.  The colors and the film make it look like it was filmed today, it does not have that washed out look common to many shows from the period.  The fact that it is set during WW Two also helps, yeah there is plenty of seventies feel but the show does have a kind of fresh ""timeless"" feel to it.  Another thing that is interesting about the show is the Nazi bad guys, used in much the same way as other tv shows, movies, and comics of the sixties and seventies.  Like Hogans Heroes the show could not be made today in our more sensitive times; notice how they stick swastikas on everything to identify the Germans just like in the comics.  So for children the show offers female ""empowerment"", and an overt yet child friendly sexuality(unless you are a puritan or radical feminist) that is missing these days.  It also has the heroes fighting for the ""red, white, and blue"" against the bad guys, another thing that is missing from most childrens action oriented tv shows and movies today. Finally, it offers a history ""lesson"", of course not that ""realistic"", but how many shows today could kids learn anything about the past and enjoy doing so.

What is amazing is as a man in his thirties, he still enjoys the magic, maybe even more, when rewatching the entire first season on dvd. Lynda Carter is the perfect Wonder Woman. She is what I imagined Charles Moulton pictured as his Wonder Woman creation in the 1940's. Lyle Wagonner's performance is wooden but his good looks offset his performance. Lynda Carter, of course, is the best looking thing in the entire series. Cloris Leachman, underrated actress, does a great comical performance as Wonder Woman's mother in the first show. Carolyn Jones does a great job too as her replacement. My favorite episode is the first episode. I love it when Wonder Woman walks into the dress shop and tries to walk away with a dress without paying for it. Highlights: Stella Stevens as a foe for Wonder Woman, Debra Winger in two episodes as Wonder Woman's sister, Roy Rogers appears in one episode and makes Wonder Woman wear a western outfit, this is behind the scenes, because he thought the Wonder Woman outfit was indecent. Buy this DVD. It is rare to see how the 1940's as it was and this is wonder magic. The cheap price for this dvd set is insulting. Take advantage.",1136073600,3,1243,4.599099099099099

2046859,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Others have more than properly covered the Lynda Carter aspect of the first season of Wonder Woman. So this is more of a shout out - basically a tribute - to the young Debra Winger.

You see, I'd never been a fan of ""Debbie Wingtip,"" and it also seemed that she died sadly in every movie I saw of her (I bet she was also mad that Barb Hershey got her role in Beaches). I also never thought she was very physically attractive, and that scratchy Susan Saint James/Kim Carnes voice was enough to drive anyone nuts!

Her main films - Urban Cowboy, Terms Of Endearment and Shadowlands - were only bearable because of factors other than her. And that recent awful ""Searching For Debra Winger"" documentary piece of tripe, wherein as the main subject of the thing as a big recluse, she predictably begs for another job in Hollywood at the tail end of it, is just patheticly B-A-D. So to me, her record had always been perfect -perfectly terrible.

I'd also never seen her on any Wonder Woman reruns, though. However, after finally seeing her in the WW 1st season DVD, I now have to admit that Winger looks - and sounds - very sexy! Gone is that ugly old lady raspy voice, and her body thankfully still has some early baby fat on it. The result is magnificent! She is a true sun-tanned young siren here (1976), a gorgeous goddess worthy of rivaling even the great Lynda Carter herself! In fact, since Winger didn't become a star until the 1980s, and her bod was so hot a half decade before that, one has to seriously ask why she didn't just go and make a fortune in porn!

She's only in three episodes, playing the role of Wondy's younger sister Wonder Girl - first appearing in parts 1 and 2 of The Feminum Mystique and then Wonder Woman In Hollywood - but her impact is nothing short of incredible. She's a sexy, shapely vision here, even out of her hip-hugging costume while playing her secret identity as a bouncing bobbysoxer.

So, Ms. Winger - my heartfelt apologies for thumbing my nose at you for all these many years. Although it's from a ""chauvanistic pig"" point of view, I am now at least acknowledging that you were, at least ONCE in your career, absolutely BEAUTIFUL!",1129420800,2,2171,4.472222222222222

2046861,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I had my first pre-teenage crush on Wonder Woman, as played by Lynda Carter: I wasn't hardly old enough to shave or wear deodorant, tho' I tried: heck I was only eleven!  Back then, in the 70's, women were far from ""liberated"", and it was definitely not a decided thing that women were ""equal"" to men in any way.  Billie Jean King began to redefine how we perceived women when she whupped the ass of Bobbie Riggs at a tennis game he should never have attended.  And Wonder Woman cemented women's equality into popular psyche, irrevocably.

Crikey!  Thirty years on, and she still radiates her magic!  I feel good and happy each time I watch this DVD.  Does Wonder Woman represent a milestone in the way we perceive Women and women's issues?  Is it an early guideline that says ""yes, she may be pretty, but she's pretty equal to any man.""  Youbetcha.  ""Wonder Woman"" did it first, the ""Bionic Woman"" did it second, ""Charlie's Angels"" did it third, and Joanna Lumley as the whup-ass dealing ""Purdey"" of the ""New Avengers"" capped it all off, forever beyond serious dispute.

But never let us forget.  ""Wonder Woman"", as played by Lynda Carter, was the Pioneer: she plowed the field that has by now been well explored by others who followed in her footsteps.  One day, this brief series will be recognized for the milestone in progressing Women's Rights that it properly is.  An American Classic!",1127779200,,1392,4.674897119341564

2046870,4,B0001ZMWYG,"It's really great to have a compilation of the New, Original Wonder Woman tv series, but it would have been better if it included all material the way it was originally presented on television. This DVD compilation is re-edited.  The opening teasers of 'Gargantua' and 'Jusdgement from outer space part two' are missing and the warner brothers logo at the closing credits is the current version rather than the original red logo of that time.  Maybe I am a bit picky but I would have liked to have seen everything that made the original Wonder Woman wonderful.

I am not sure if this box set should have been listed as the complete first season because the original pilot (missing on this DVD set - see comment below) was released in 1975 and was followed by two television specials in early 1976 - listed as episodes 1 and 2 on this DVD set.  Incidently the pilot is based on stories directly from the comics - All-Star Comics #8, 1941, Sensation Comics #1, 1942 and Wonder Woman #1, 1942.  Wonder Woman Meets The Baroness Von Gunther is based on the third story in Wonder Woman #1, 1942 and Fausta the nazi Wonder Woman is based on the story in Comic Cavalcade #2, 1943.  The first episode of the first season on ABC tv was Beauty on Parade which introduced new sound effects for Wonder Woman's powers and the famous 'lighting change spin'.

Does anyone remeber the pilot movie presentation well enough?  There were two different edited versions of the pilot.  The original (not presented here) is the true film entitled 'The New, Original Wonder Woman' in the opening credits.  This 1975 movie is edited slightly different from the pilot on this DVD.  For example the opening credits reveal the entire title after a tank explodes a wall in the old news reel, rather than the burst of stars which just says 'Wonder Woman' as revealed on this DVD.  Another example is when the animated Wonder Woman leaps down from the building she lands and deflects bullets then punches the bad guy.  This is replaced on this DVD with her twirling her golden lasso instead - used in the tv series opening as well (perhaps due to classification and rating reasons).  If you notice the bottom opening animated panel after the title 'Wonder Woman', you can see the panel in which she stands in the bullets and bracelets pose against a villain with a gun - this is the only evidence to show it existed!  Pretty much the story is the same, and most shots are identical except that the acting is played less campy, for example Ashly Norman does not roll his eyes firing at Wonder Woman near the close of the story.  Instead he his determined in this pilot version!  I have this version of the film on VHS and wish that this version could be released on DVD, perhaps with the 1974 pilot 'Wonder Woman'starring Cathy Lee Crosby and the 1967 'Wonder Woman: Who's afraid of Diana Prince' as bonus features.  That would truly be wonderful.",1125360000,2,2914,4.614341085271318

It's not the same in season 2 because it's steve's son. Also, in season 2, Diana seems more world weary.
Definitely watch season 1 first! It's such a great way to escape from the humdrum of daily life.

2046875,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Nominated for a single Emmy in its short three season stint, Wonder Woman - which premiered in 1976 - was the third attempt by the major networks to bring the popular comic book character to TV. Created as the result of a collaboration between the multi-talented William M. Marston and DC Comics publisher Maxwell Gaines, Wonder Woman made her world premiere in a 1941 comic book. The final product of Gaines' request for a female comic book hero, Marston never lived to see his creation become a television star (he died prematurely from skin cancer in 1947), but his legacy lives on through the Wonder Woman franchise which continues to entertain worldwide audiences to this day...

Wonder Woman follows the exploits of the Amazonian princess, Diana, who leaves her Paradise Island home in order to bring justice to the world of men. Athletic and intelligent, Diana Prince (as she's known to the outside world) also possesses special powers that are brought about when she whirls around to transform into Wonder Woman. Her magic belt gives her added strength, her metallic bracelets deflect bullets, and her tiara doubles as a boomerang... In addition, she's aided by a magic golden lasso which forces her captives to tell the truth! Season 1 of Wonder Woman takes place during the era of World War II where the Allies enlist the help of the female superhero to defeat the Nazis, while Seasons 2 and 3 take place in modern day times (1977-1978)...

The Wonder Woman (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere ""Wonder Woman Meets Baroness Von Gunther"" in which Col. Steve Trevor - the same man who crash-landed on Wonder Woman's home island, and thus prompted her to enter the world of men - is accused of sabotaging a series of missions under his command. Charged with treason and espionage, Trevor can only have his name cleared by Wonder Woman who uncovers a vast conspiracy by Nazi sympathizers... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""The Pluto File"" in which Wonder Woman must apprehend an Irish-born spy who steals an American-made machine that controls earthquakes, and ""Formula 407"" in which Wonder Woman travels to Mexico in order to recover a secret formula stolen by the Nazis...

2046889,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I remember when 'Wonder Woman' was on the air in the late 1970s and early 1980s as a young child. She was sexier and more entertaining than 'the Bionic Woman' (and just about every other woman on tv except maybe Suzanne Somer's character of ""Chrissie"" on 'Three's Company'), and had a real comic book character drama scripting episode by episode. What sets 'Wonder Woman' apart from 'Superman' & 'Batman' back-in-the-day is that you really got to feel her character as person first. And then as a super heroe. She was as personable as can be; yet, she knew just when to put you in check with her super powers. She was very selective and timing in using them.

Even as the times have adjusted now with the new exploration into who is 'Batman' movie of the Summer with darker themes, 'Wonder Woman' stands so far in front and unlike 'Catwoman' (movie) it actually was worthy of awards such as Emmys [being it was a tv drama]. I think it was nominated for an Emmy.

I called her up after I ordered this so we could watch it together (sans bathings suits and crowns or course!) When I popped in this DVD, I was transported back to that innocent time.

  Now, as an adult, I find different enjoyment in watching the DVD. I laugh at the campiness (Eric Braden's facial expressions in the early plane fight are to die for!) and the idealism that Wonder Woman stood for. I also love Lyle Wagoner's Steve Trevor.

2046897,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I was born in 1976, so when I was old enough to understand ""Wonder Woman,"" the show must have been in re-runs.  She was just as popular the second time around, and I predict her popularity will soar once again with the release of the first and second seasons on DVD.

I've always had fond, albeit vague memories of the ""Wonder Woman"" show.  ""Wonder Woman"" was my favorite tv show when I was a child, and Wonder Woman is still my favorite Superhero of all time.

When I heard the ""Wonder Woman"" theme song for the first time in about 20 years, I was ecstatic.  I love the way comic book art is used during the introduction, as well as the comic book feel of the episodes in general.  In addition, I like how the first season reflects the original comic book, which was also set in the World War II era.

One thing I really enjoy about the first season, (that is eventually weeded out in subsequent seasons,) is the feminist slant.  Wonder Woman was a great role model for young girls in the '70s and '80s, because she was not just a beautiful and sexy brunette, she was strong, intelligent, kind, tough, and an advocate for peace, women's rights, and freedom.

Watching Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman is really a treat.  Despite being an unknown and having very little acting experience, she took on the lead role like no one else could.  She is not only visually appealing, but a very talented actress as well.

I was nervous to watch ""Wonder Woman"" again after so long, because often the shows we like as children turn out looking overly campy and ridiculous when we watch them as adults.  Not so with ""Wonder Woman.""  The show was very well done, and innovative for the time.

I also enjoyed the documentary feature, with interviews.  They reveal a lot about how the show was developed and cast, and how they did special effects back then.

I highly recommend this DVD to any comic book/Wonder Woman fan, parents with children,(especially young girls,) anyone interested in television history, anyone who remembers having watched the show when it was first on tv, feminists, and teenagers.",1109548800,2,2089,4.602702702702703

Wonder Woman remains the greatest superheroine of all time, not to mention the longest-lasting, and in my opinion, much like Lou Ferrigno and the Hulk, no one can ever play Wonder Woman better than Lynda Carter.

2046910,4,B0001ZMWYG,"I remember when this show was first on TV.  A television critic once said that there were only two good things about this show...and both of them were holding up Lynda Carter's costume.  Hey, let's face it, the main reason that so many males watched this show, including teenage boys of the day like myself was to oggle at the beautiful, and well-built Lynda Carter.  Like all things nostalgic, when you look back at them years later with a more mature eye you can find a lot of qualities that you missed.

Wonder Woman was not, technically, a great show.  It was cheesy and campy but still darn good fun to watch.  Carter played her role with gusto and seemed to be having a great time.  I practically spit my lunch when I heard that Sandra Bullock was being considered to play Wonder Woman in a big screen film.  I'd rather have Carter now play Wonder Woman than bullock.

The set includes all 14 episodes from Season 1 including the pilot set during WWII where U.S. pilot Maj. Steve Trevor is shot down by Nazis and lands on paradise Islands where he finds the female race of Amazons.  Princess Diana (carter) helps Trevor to regain his health and then follows him back to the U.S. to help battle evil.  She takes on a secret identity ala Clark Kent behind thick glasses and workds for the war department.

Here are some of the best episodes from season one:

""The Nazi Wonder Woman"" - A female Nazi spy captures Wonder Woman to learn her powers then disguises herself as the real thing as Wonder Woman is taken to GErmany.  The Beutiful Lynda Day George played Fausta the Nazi spy.

""Wonder Woman vs. Gargantua""  In a real nod to 1940's comic book stories, Diana must battle a nazi Gorilla!!!

""Beauty on Parade""  - When Wonder Woman's alter-ego, Diana Prince, enters a suspicious beauty contest to uncover the truth behind the sabotage of radar scanning equipment, she and Steve discover that there is something much more insidious underway that threatens the security of the United States.

""The Pluto File"" - Wonder Woman has her hands full when an Irish mercenary named Fallon steals an American-developed device that can control or eliminate earthquakes. To make matters worse, Fallon is also a carrier of the Bubonic Plague and, as such, threatens America on two levels.  Guest stars Robert Reed of Brady Bunch fame.

One of the great things about watching these episodes is seeing many of the 1970's TV stars in guest spots for the first time in years as many have passed on.  The set includes nice extras including commentary on the pilot episode and a new documentary.  You have to see these for a wonderful ride on the ""way back"" machine.",1106697600,3,2652,4.63169164882227
2046911,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Thank you!! Thank you!! THANK YOU!  I nearly screamed when I saw this in the bookstore...  my friend must have thought I was nuts!!  I was saying, 'You know what DVD I wish they had...' as I looked down toward the w's... then I continued, 'Wonder Wo - GASP!'  I was almost jumping up and down with glee.

I went home and watched it and I was SO NOT disappointed!  It was spectacular!  Oh!  I loved it!  Linda Carter was my idol growing up... to this day, Wonder Woman is my FAVE comic character!  And I still can't think of anyone else who could play this role.  Linda played the part with so much elegance, class, style and panache... there is just no comparison.  And what a GIRL power concept!  It was and still is, wonderful!  Why can't there be more shows like this... where even the bad guys are treated with respect and dignity... Wonder Woman was just a smash hit of an idea and watching it again made me feel like a kid again.  Sure, when I saw it, it was already in syndication... but I would race home from school to see it...

I can't WAIT for Season TWO!! Hurry up March, 2005!!

If you loved Wonder Woman as a kid, you will LOVE this DVD!",1106524800,3,1152,4.187214611872146
2046912,4,B0001ZMWYG,"Anyone who grew up in 70s watching TV shows can not forget the amount of entertainment and enjoyment, week after week, the TV shows brought them and their families right in their living room. Linda Carter is not only beautiful, but captivating as Wonder Woman who in her satin tights in red, white and blue fights the bad guys. The show is set in 1940s; while trying to stop a Nazi plane from reaching the U.S., Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner) is shot down, landing on mythical Paradise Island: home to Princess Diana (Lynda Carter, former Miss USA 1973) who is intrigued by the Major and his tales of Nazis. She follows the Major back to the U.S. and joins the forces of good against the evil. There are three discs that contain 13 episodes; the complete first season. The quality of CDs is acceptable, and the picture quality is reasonable. If you are fan of 70s TV shows and you are considering buying this one; I recommend this, it is a good value for the money.",1105660800,3,969,4.480225988700565
2046913,4,B0001ZMWYG,"I was a humongous fan of ""Wonder Woman"" as a preteen. I recently viewed the first season on DVD and was surprised at how ""grrrrl power"" it is. Sure, it's seriously heavy on the fromage factor (I'd say it's cheddarella on the scale of cheesiness) but there are some great lines about how women are powerful in their own right and how we should look beyond gender. It's one of those shows they should resurrect with Lynda Carter playing the Amazon Queen this time around (Cloris Leachman in the pilot and Carolyn Jones in another episode played the part of the Amazon Queen).

  Things to love: the lounge performer slickness of Lyle Waggoner as stud muffin Major Steve Trevor, the Sidekick sighing of Beatrice Colen, the entire pilot episode with the exceptional over the top acting of John Randolph and Stella Stevens, the vaguely lesbian overtones in the pilot and other episodes, seeing Fannie Flagg in the pilot as the Amazonian Surgeon and Debra Winger as Wonder Woman's literal little sister.

2046915,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I have 4 kids ranging in age from 9 down to a newborn but this year for Christmas I was the one screaming and jumping up and down more than any of the kids.  When I opened up the Wonder Woman season DVD I almost passed out.  I just couldn't believe it. I was a HUGE fan as a kid.  I had wonder woman barbie, towels,etc.  I used to love to pretend that I was Wonder Woman with all my friends.  I even had told my kids all the stories of Wonder Woman that I could remember so that even THEY were excited when they realized they woudl finally get to watch the show and not just hear about it.  I don't think my kids knew how to react seeing their mom so hyped about something!!!!  When my husband hit play and the Wonder Woman song came on it all came back to me.  I was absolutely in heaven!!  I was dancing and rocking out to ""You're a wonder, Wonder Woman!!!!""  All my kids were dancing with me and I was so excited to see my kids being introduced to the greatest tv show of all time! Ok....well that could by my nostalgia from childhood but no matter how hokey this show was (and now as an adult I realize it was pretty hokey) I just don't care. As far as I am concerned Wonder Woman is still the best tv show ever made.  I love Lynda Carter.  I was such a loyal devoted fan that even when she starred in that one hour show with Lonnie Anderson later in the 80's that got cancelled quickly I still watched the show out of loyalty to Lynda Carter.  The show she was in with Lonnie was not a good show but I was a devoted Wonder Woman fan to the end.  I hope they come out with every single episode ever made. I will buy every one.",1104019200,79,1630,3.960122699386503
2046916,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Wonder Woman was undoubtably an early E.C.I. for Me, with her flowing black hair, pale skin, and crystal blue eyes, not to mention her knock-out physique. She seems a female version of Superman, and even Captain America, in most respects as well, with her alter-ego of Diana Prince, which seems equivalent to Clarke Kent {even though it was billed to be in response to the Batman series at the time}. This Solstice, LB received this gift from acquaintances, and watching it with her brought back quite an evocation, revitalizing lustful ponderations. Lynda Carter really is an amazing beauty {also a former Ms. USA}, unsullied by current depictions of enmasculated ""womyn"", and does carry a glamorous charm about her, really seen when she twirls for her transformation.

Set in WW2 era America, the primary enemy throughout the series are the Nazis, devising several ingenious ways to infiltrate the government, and when their plans reach too close for comfort, WW appears to save the day, ""in her satin tights"", along with Mjr. Steve Trevor {Lyle Waggoner}, who becomes more or less her sidekick, since being stranded on this uncharted isle in The Devil's Triangle after a sky battle. Born on Paradise Island, an 'amazonian' utopia, she enters into an ""olympics""-like event incognito, proving to be the most formidable contestant, and much to the chagrin of her mother, who desired that she stay with her and rule as warrior Princess, cannot deny her daughter her destiny, who then proceeds to enter the outer world of mere mortals to battle the Third Reich. With her transperent plane, bullet-proof bracelets and truth lasso, she becomes the legendary heroine of comic book legendry.

I was also delighted to discover that Wonder Woman's mother is portrayed here by none other than Carolyn Jones, yet another ECI evocation, whom you will remember as Morticia Addams; and even through this role, her elegant demeanor shines through.

WW became a representation for female strength without compromising the glamor inherent in the female species, which is womens' greatest asset, and that is truly powerful combination.",1103760000,3,2118,5.151162790697675
2046917,5,B0001ZMWYG,"And to think the pre recorded VHS copies were as few as the channels that showed this after ABC and CBS ""shelved it"".  I bought my set here at Amazon, and enjoy it immensely.  This first set as stated above is the Original ABC Series (which I call the ""war"" series) where all the episodes take place during World War II.  The show was comic strip basically, but still a lot of fun.  Besides Lynda and Lyle, the other regulars are Richard Eastham (most remembered from Disney's That Darn Cat) as General Blankenship (John Randolph plays him in the pilot though) and Beatrice Colen (previously just a bit part waitress on Happy Days) as Etta Candy (the general's secretary)  It's a shame that ABC just left them hanging, but there are just so many war stories you can tell. Then again, they did get a veteran like Roy Rogers to appear in a story dealing with cattle rustlers which helped out.  The series also marked the beginning of the career of big screen icon of the 80s: Debra Winger.  Watch for her in the 2 part ""Feminum Mystique"" and the season fianle ""Wonder Woman In Hollywood"".  By the way in the case of the 2 parters (""Feminum Mystique"" and ""Judgment From Outer Space"") the coming attractions for the part 2s are not included, but the past attractions FROM the part 1s are.  They will probably do this for the others as well in the other 2 sets (""Mind Stealers From Outer Space"" in Season 2 and ""Phantom Of The Roller Coaster"" and ""The Boy Who Knew Her Secret"" in Season 3) so watch for them.",1102636800,2,1503,4.4363636363636365

For not seeing it in so long when I first started watching it I was a little disappointed (I guess because all the TV nowadays has to do with sex, innuendo, language, sex and more sex and you expect it) but as I watched through the first disc I found I truly enjoyed watching it. It's clean, there isn't any foul language, it was funny and a little campy. And Lynda Carter is wonderful, who couldn't watch her all day? Wonder Woman talks about women sticking up for themselves and she goes out and proves it. It has now become one of my favorite sets to watch and I go around humming the tune all day.

The only thing I didn't care for was that the discs are double sided, other than that, I'm happily waiting for season 2 and 3 and wishing they had done more.",1097971200,5,859,4.168674698795181
2046927,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I liked this series!

Super hero productions are VERY hard to make. Casting the most important... You have to find an actor that not only looks the part, but also is good enough that the audience excepts them in the role, and the production has to treat the material seriously.

Until recently with XMen and Spiderman, these kinds of productions only got the casting correct twice... Christopher Reeve's SUPERMAN, and Lynda Carter's WONDER WOMAN. These actors were PERFECT for the roles, it isn't their fault the producers didn't take the serious approach to the stories.

At the time this program was made, it was such a novel idea for the women to go around saving the men (and not screaming and fainting), I guess the thought was that you have to make it lighthearted or the public wouldn't except it. I guess they also figured it wasn't lady like to give bad guy a boot to the head, or an upper-cut to the stomach.

Still, considering it's age, this was a great production. It was pretty faithful to the comic book version. Lynda Carter is just as impossibly beautiful as Wonder Woman is in the books (she still is even today!)... I also think she is very under rated as an actor, as only a good actor could make this kind of character work, especially dressed like that!

The first season is an example of what perfect casting, and good acting can do with rather average stories.

This is a great BOX set, the pilot was GREAT (especially with Lynda Carter's commentary). I love watching Wonder Woman throw bad guys around like yesterdays garbage! There are many actors and comics that had parts in the series that aren't alive any more... it is great to see them also!",1097452800,3,1673,4.597315436241611

All the fun of the vintage series is preserved here and you will enjoy seeing her fight the Nazi bad guys all over again....you'll also realize how significant this series was in the scope of popular culture.  (OK, ignore the fact that everything looks like it's shot on the Warner Brothers backlot and Pacific Coast Highway!)

Lynda and Lyle are dynamite (why did she prefer the updated series when it moved to ""present day!?!"") and having the pilot episode included is a real treat.  No one beats Stella Stevens, Cloris Leachman and Red Buttons for campy comic book fun.  Unfortunately, the commentary track with Carter and Cramer lacked focus and direction.  Great to have unscripted, impromptu commentary but not when it makes them sound dotty, which is the case here.

The documentary is pointless...short and unrevealing, with no real special moments.  The Wonder Woman phenomenon is so rich and still so powerful, a much better documentary is deserved and expected.  That's the real reason I have to lose one star off a perfect rating.  Fans, cast and crew should have been included beyond what's there.  A major (Trevor) disappointment.

2046946,4,B0001ZMWYG,"Long before Buffy staked her first vampire, and long before Xena wielded her sword, an Amazon princess pleased TV audiences with a bright, campy and stylish show that never played down its comic origins.  Remembering its smashing success with BATMAN in the late 60's, the ABC television network tried to make history repeat itself by using the classic DC comics heroine as the new focus. The show mainly covered the adventures of the super Amazon, Diana, who leaves her island home to help America fight off the evil Nazis during World War II in her new identity as Wonder Woman. Disguising herself as the yeoman secretary to Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner), Diana fights both the Germans, while harboring a secret crush for her boss.
 After a failed pilot with a badly miscast Cathy Lee Crosby, ABC hit gold with former beauty queen Lynda Carter in the central role.  Despite being very inexperienced at the time, Carter was perfect for the role.  Her leggy, raven-haired beauty fit the role like a glove, while her open and easy-going manner made the character very accessible. Indeed, Carter makes such a strong impression, that it's still hard today to envision anyone else in the role.  Lyle Waggoner, who had just left THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW, is solid as her laid-back, yet heroic, boss.  The plots are wonderfully cheesy, with Wonder Woman fighting anything from a Nazi controlled gorilla to evil cowboys. Debra Winger also makes a couple of memorable appearances as Diana's kid sister, who has her own superhero identity as Wonder Girl.
The DVD has a wonderful pilot commentary with producer Douglas C. Kramer and Ms. Carter as they both provide wonderful tidbits of information.  There is also a fun featurette covering the show's first season as well. Ms. Carter (who still is a stunner today in her 50's) definitely shows both respect and appreciation for the role that defined her career in this film.
WONDER WOMAN's campiness isn't as over the top like BATMAN's, but the whole World War II atmosphere and the charming performances make this a fun time for TV fans everywhere.  As such, this is definitely a show to recommend.",1094342400,2,2141,4.895027624309392

I'm definitely getting that too. Oh and Amazon's price is THE price to beat. I was in the US and Canada this summer and boy the price of it at the stores are not competitive at all. Thanks, Amazon.

I like the double-sided aspect of the DVD too 'cause that saves me space. However, it can be hard sometimes to find out which side I should put in when I try to watch it again and again.  Oh well...I still love it. Now, how about a T-shirt? Hmm....

It doesn't matter that the plots are poor and the characters are one dimensional at best (they are comic book characters after all), Ms. Carter is beautiful and I give her props for not only looking the part but playing the part with just the right amount of naivite and toughness.

Lynda Carter went from nowheresville to superstardom in a twirl and a flash.  One of the DVD-extras include a WW Retrospective almost 30 years since this premiered and Ms. Carter reveals that Executive Producer Douglas Cramer had to fight ""ABC suits"" to let her don the magic belt and golden lasso.  Good call, Doug.

ABC was scared off by a no-name at the time to carry one a one-woman, hour-long adventure show.  Who heard of a one-woman show in 1975?  Where were the superhero leading ladies?  They were all one-man shows (Six Million Dollar Man, Vegas, Hawaii Five-O, Rockford Files, etc).  Carter answered the call, rookie-status and all.

This 13-episode 1st season of Wonder Woman sticks truer to its comic book origins than the version we later saw on CBS (who the heck is Joe Atkinson in Wonder Woman-lore?!).  These episodes are set against the backdrop of World War II and an endless battle against the Nazi's.

Great guest starts like Christine Belford, Lynda Day George, Tim O'Connor, newcomer Debra Winger, John Saxon, Roy Rogers, Robert Reed, Dick Van Patten & Robert Hays led the way of likeable performances from good guys and bad.

Kudos to Lyle Waggoner who at a time of nothing but leading men, was able & willing to play ""second-fiddle"" to a heroine.  His willingness to bite into the role sold Steve Trevor.

Speaking of Mr. Waggoner, that was about the only thing missing from the DVD-package.  There were a few interviews, and Carter & Cramer gave a running commentary on the pilot, but where were interviews with Waggoner?

One negative which maybe can be revised in future packaging is the ""Feminum Mystique"" 2-part episode needs a disc-flip to catch both parts.  Bad call.",1092700800,5,1922,4.864615384615385
2046954,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Included in this DVD set are the original series pilot and the remaining 13 season one episodes plus an interesting documentary of Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman and the show itself. Diana Prince with those ugly glasses was still stunning and Wonder Woman was absolutely beautiful. The one thing that always puzzled me was that she didn't wear a mask, so how come Major Trevor never put the two together as smart as he was? Wonder Woman season one is a must for all 1970's TV fans and a great introduction to her character.

I can't believe it; ""Wonder Woman"" is finally here. This is 1970's fun filled cheese at its very best. What teenage boy didn't have a crush on ""Wonder Woman"" growing up? I know I did and I still love her today. With its memorable opening sequence from comic strip to live action and Lynda Carter in that spectacular outfit, the stage was set for Wonder Woman to save the world. One look at the beautiful Lynda Carter and you can see why the studio chose her to play Wonder Woman.

I think Lynda Carter created the character of Wonder Woman more than the studio created the role for her. Sure they could remake this series today with amazing special effects, but who would play Wonder Woman; nobody that's who. There isn't an actress in Hollywood today with the grace, charm and beauty of Lynda Carter. She was, is and will always be Wonder Woman to me.

This show was so popular in the 70's that many well known actors and actresses wanted guest roles on the show as villains. This DVD set is well done with an amazing picture and decent sound given the age of the original material. The artwork on the exterior and interior of the packaging is well done. The 3 double sided discs are a bit of a disappointment. While I'm not a fan of the double sided discs I guess it keeps the cost of the set down, so it's not really a big deal.

2046955,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Born in the early 1970s there are few television shows I remember from that decade - I have fleeting recollections of 'The Rockford Files' and 'Starsky and Hutch.' One television series I do have very vivid memories of is 'Wonder Woman.'

I remember sitting watching the adventures of the Amazonian superhero with my grandfather, gushing with excitement at every cheesy, over-the-top moment of it.

You see in the late 1970s I had two schoolboy crushes on actresses. One was Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in 'Star Wars' and the other was (Former Miss USA) Lynda Carter in her role as Diana in 'Wonder Woman.'

The day this came out on DVD I rushed out to the local video store to recapture the spirit of my childhood. Nostalgia is a very powerful force and for hours after returning home with my prize I was back in the 1970s, back watching 'Wonder Woman' with my late grandfather and, with adult eyes this time, noting just how ridiculous it was, but oh so enjoyably so.

That's one of the secrets of the shows success - it doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it doesn't expect - or want - its audience to either.

It was remarkable to hear Lynda Carter and Executive Producer Douglas S. Cramer share their memories in the audio commentary that accompanies the pilot. Almost 30 years later the two still share a warmth and strong memories of the groundbreaking show.

Amazing too was the documentary on the third disc of the set titled 'Beauty, Brawn and Bulletproof Bracelets: A Wonder Woman Retrospective' that featured Carter, Cramer and Wonder Woman creator Dr. William Moulton Marsten. I am a big fan of retrospective documentaries (like those that appear on the James Bond DVDs for example), much more so than the featurettes  that appear on newer movies. The passage of time allows for a better reflection on the product and a more genuine appreciation from those involved (too often in newer movies and shows the actors and crew are still in promotional mode).

This first season is truer to the original comic book character in that the adventures are set during World War II. I think this was an inspired and insightful decision by the producers as it made the show more timeless, with the clear cut villainy of cartoonish Nazi's as the baddies.

Included here is the complete first season, the pilot (originally aired on Nov. 7, 1975) and 13 regular season episodes (that aired from April 21, 1976 to Feb. 16, 1977).

With its limited special effects, cliched dialogue and self deprecating humor this show is so bad - it's good. I simply cannot wait for the further adventures of Wonder Woman to appear on DVD!",1091232000,20,2629,4.733041575492341
2046956,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Well finally, they made the first season in DVD, and complete too.  This is a bit camp, some cheese, but it is probably one of the best renditions of super hero comicbookdom ever made.  Any one who loves Wonder Women (pre-90's), this is a must have.  Now all they need to do is complete the series on DVD.",1091145600,3,305,4.224137931034483

2046958,4,B0001ZMWYG,"I fondly recall watching Wonder Woman when it first aired in the 70's an eleven year old.  I was a comic book fan, loved the Batman TV series, and for me this was more of the same.  The TV shows first season went with the WWII setting as that is the time when Wonder Woman first hit the comic scene.  The pilot was a movie of the week that did so well that 13 episodes were then ordered for it.  The pilot did so well that the Wonder Woman comic jumped back to telling WWII episodes for a period of time to help tie in to the show.  When season 2 and 3 came along and jumped her up to modern times, the comics followed suit.

Sure, the show is cheesy at points and is very much a product of 70's TV production, but I find it a good bit of programming that I can watch with my child (whose about the right age to still enjoy the innocent nature of the show).  With so much dreck on TV today, this is a nice change of pace!",1090886400,5,921,3.893048128342246
2046959,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I still can't believe I already have the complete first season DVDs of Wonder Woman in our collection! The moment I put it on the player and heard the famous jingle..I thought I was a kid again. I suddenly remember my sister breaking her arm after spinning while standing on a chair, with my mother scolding her before that because it was a Good Friday and my sister kept on playing Wonder Woman (rescuing me) hehe. Never mind if I have to spend a few thousand pesos just to ship this DVD here in the Philippines.  IT'S ALL WORTH IT. The picture quality, the sound, and the packaging were carefully processed to preserve the 70's look and feel and the POW effect that comes with every DC character! I've got no problems about the discs being double-sided. As long as people know how to take care of their precious DVDs then the discs would last a lifetime.  The packaging is also incredible. The colorful drawings, comic-style spread and the accompanying trivia about WW makes this collection stand out from other DVD packages. Warner Brothers sure knows how to come up with a good video collection.

Of course, Lynda Carter makes the show a success. She's the definitive Wonder Woman.  No one can replace her for the role. She gave it her all, being a new actress with a breakthrough role. I think what made her so effective is that Lynda in person is also a role model for women and for the rest of us. Did you know that when she had a concert here in Manila in 1980 she went to the slum people and gave many gifts to them? She rode on a train and kept on getting out to reach out to the poor along the rails. She's really a class-act. Even today she's still actively involved in many charitable projects and civic programs. She definitely continued the Wonder Woman legacy. And I think that's the reason why the role fit her perfectly. Lynda is indeed a WONDER WOMAN.",1090540800,8,1870,4.45906432748538
2046960,5,B0001ZMWYG,"When I first learned that this boxed set was slated for release, I was terrified to buy it. I was afraid that the show would not hold up 25 years later, and I did not want to tarnish my wonderful childhood memories of Ms. Lynda Carter (easily one of the most gorgeous women ever to grace the small screen) strutting around in her Wonder Woman outfit.

  Well, I am pleased to report that this show is as enjoyable now as it was when I was five years old. Yes, there are plot holes and silliness, but these episodes are flawed gems from a simpler, more innocent time of television. Carter and Lyle Waggonner (quite the looker as well!) are impossibly adorable and their chemistry together is charming, to say the very least.

  And Lynda Carter's commentary during the pilot is informative and funny! What a classy, humorous lady!",1090540800,5,829,4.5675675675675675
2046961,5,B0001ZMWYG,This is a great set of dvds.  The reviewer who said these episodes are out of order is mistaken.  They are also wrong in saying this isn't the first season.  It is.  These dvds look great and I'm glad I got the set.,1090368000,3,215,3.9302325581395348
2046962,4,B0001ZMWYG,"I think this season of the program holds up quite well, if you appreciate the tone that the cast and crew were aiming for. The telefilm from 1975 lays on the campiness with a heavy hand. The actors, with the exception of Carter, are truly going for laughs (especially Cloris Leachman and Stella Stevens).

 The remaining episodes from 1976 and 1977 dispose of most of the camp in favor of a light, but not mocking, brand of humor.

 Storyline implausibilities abound--but I can forgive that. If you're going to buy into WW being able to deflect bullets with bracelets, you may as well buy into the whole thing!

 Special effects are often flimsy and the fight scenes can be a bit underwhelming.

 Having said all that, this show still thrills me. Throughout, Lynda Carter is engaging. Her earnestness, grace, dignity and even her sometimes clunky line readings just work for the character. And it is as if the gods made her to wear that costume.

 The dramatic and sexy spin transformation, the funky theme song, the recurring plot device of men underestimating women, the ideals WW champions--integrity and learning from our mistakes, the delightful humor Beatrice Colen supplied as Etta Candy, the wholesome flirtation between Maj. Steve Trevor and WW--these are just some of the reasons I enjoy the show. And unlike the CBS version of the program, the ABC year actually embraced the comic book roots.

 Gargantua is the most unintentionally funny episode. The Pluto File and Formula 407 are the least involving stories. But both episodes have interesting bits. In Pluto we see WW demonstrating her mathematical/mental aptitude and in Formula 407, Carter shows some comic skills when Diana Prince finds herself in the unusual position of deflecting a pushy would-be lover man.

 There is some effective storytelling in episodes like Judgment from Outer Space Pts. I and II, The Last Of The Two-Dollar Bills and my favorite, Fausta, the Nazi Wonder Woman.

 Like the song says, ""You're a wonder, Wonder Womaaaan!!""",1090368000,3,2015,4.9880239520958085
2046963,1,B0001ZMWYG,"The ""First season""?-I do not think so !. The episodes are mixed chronologically from 1975-1977. You can tell anyway from the different hair and/or wigs Wonder woman wore every year. She also seemed to get less chubby and leaner towards the later years. Her costume also changed.

 They obviously put it out too quickly due to fan response.

 The prints are also put out from medium quality film prints-check out the lines and hairs that appear from time to time.

 True Wonder Woman fans will be outraged.

 If the the second season is like this , I will not buy it!

 Otherwise, this show is pretty good, but I expected more of a ""Batman"" feel considering Stanley Ralph Ross had such a hand in both shows. The DVD transfer looks great, however.",1090281600,3,390,4.953846153846154
2046965,5,B0001ZMWYG,This show still holds up very well. It's a bit cheesy but much less so than Otis in the Superman movies or many things in the Batman movies. Lynda plays Wonder Woman straight (not for laughs) and brings a real earnestness to the character. The special effects are really effective for the time. I loved this as a child and still think it's great. Belongs in every super hero dvd library. There's also a fantastic documentary and a fun commentary track with Wonder Woman herself. The picture and sound are very good too. Highly recommended.,1090281600,4,539,4.684210526315789
2046976,4,B0001ZMWYG,"With the entire world at war, freedom needs a special power on its side to prevail.  Fortunately, the war has attracted the attention of the Amazons on Paradise Island.  Venturing off, Princess Diana (Lynda Carter) travels to the USA to join the fight of the Allies along side Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner).  Constantly called on to help, Wonder Woman must use her super strength, bullet stopping bracelets, and unbreakable lasso of truth to stop the Nazis from taking over the world.
I was a little too young to watch this show when it was first on, but I've found reruns and grown to love it.  Yes, it has a certain cheese factor, but it's fun.  Lynda Carter is wonderful as our heroine.  I honestly can't picture anyone else in the roll.  And Lyle Waggoner is great as the sidekick.  While some of the special effects are cheesy, others hold up remarkable well today.
Unfortunately, the first season isn't quite as good as the season that followed.  Set in World War II, it seems cheesier then most.  Part of it is the over abundance of the camp factor.  And part of it is the dialog is rather poor at times.  This is especially true when Wonder Woman/Diana Prince is given ""women power"" lines.  The lectures just don't come off well.  Still, there is stuff to enjoy here, and the guest stars are impressive.  They include Cloris Leachman, Red Buttons, Robert Reed, Dick van Patten, Debra Winger in her first credited roll, and Roy Rogers.
Any fan of Wonder Woman will love this set.  It contains the extended pilot plus all 13 episodes for the first season.  These are all the World War II era episodes.  The episodes are spread out over 3 double-sided discs.  The picture (original full screen) looks sharp most of the time.  The stock footage from the 40's looks worse then the rest, but it's not on for very long.  The audio is 2.0 mono, which won't blow you away but certainly gets the job done.  The bonus features consist of an uneven but mostly interesting commentary by Lynda Carter and Executive Producer Douglas S. Cramer on the pilot and a new 20 minute documentary on the creation of the series.
This isn't my favorite season of the show, but there are still some entertaining episodes here.  It's interesting to watch the development of the TV show, and you certainly can't beat the price.  Bring on season 2!",1090195200,5,2331,4.615571776155718

When I heard that Wonder Woman was coming out on DVD, I was so excited!  But who knew that there were many, many others like myself, waiting in anticipation for this compilation of the Wonder Woman's first season?
And you know what?  It holds up well today.  Yeah, there's tons of cheesy special effects and some of the music is outdated, but what makes this work are two things:  comic book mentality and Lynda Carter.
The show works because it adheres to its comic book roots; pitting good guys and women against the bad guys (Nazis) while allowing Diana Prince to hide her identity as Wonder Woman.  And as WW, Lynda Carter is simply great.  I don't think she has ever received her due as an actress.  But she really is perfectly cast in the role.  I cannot see anyone else in this role, much like Christopher Reeve in Superman and Tobey Maguire in Spiderman.  She IS Wonder Woman.  She finds that perfect balance between light comedy and superhero.  She is not too serious in the role, yet you never doubt that she is this superhero who walks around in sexy shorts and bright colours.  She is charismatic, sexy, intelligent, and funny.  And she brings both these qualities to Diana and WW.  It's too bad she never received an Emmy for this role.  But then again, even today, Sarah Michelle Gellar never got her due for Buffy.
This package is worth watching.  It's loads of fun, perfect for the whole family.",1089504000,8,1483,4.5606060606060606

Plus the image and sound are really great on these DVDs.  But the real treasure is hearing the commentary by Lynda Carter and Doug Cramer. Ms. Carter brings the same honesty, fun, and happy outlook she has in the series to her commentary track. You can tell she is genuinely having fun watching the pilot for the first time in years.  She provides really interesting 'tidbits' about the show and how certain things were done.
Everyone already has commented how great she is in the show, how she really seems born to have played this part. And from evertyhing I've seen or read about Ms. Carter she really is a nice and genuine person and treats her fans with affection and respect.
I highly recommend this collection (the packaging is really nice too btw).

2047000,5,B0001ZMWYG,"In many respects, Wonder Woman needs no introduction - as soon as it debuted in 1975, the show exploded into popular consciousness.  We of a certain age will fondly remember the lunch boxes, Halloween costumes, Colorform books... and quite possibly our first crush.  But similar to The Batman Show, overexposure and increasingly indifferent writing killed the show after three short seasons.  Even so, it never really went away, showing up as repeats on various cable and local TV stations ever since.
For the uninitiated, the show began as a series of TV movies on ABC.  A previous, disastrous special starring Kathy Lee Crosby that had nothing to do with the comic book had recently aired, and producer Douglas Cramer decided to start from scratch, basing his new movie more directly on the DC Comics heroine.  This accounts for its somewhat bizarre title, The New, Original Wonder Woman.  It was a ratings hit, which prompted two more movies before ABC picked it up as a series in 1976.  Two things made the show unique.  First, it was set during the height of WWII.  Second, it played clear homage to its comic book origins, particularly in the opening credits and its use of handwritten ""narration blocks"" with each change of scene (""Meanwhile, at a top secret Nazi base in Germany..."").  Although it was successful, ABC declined to renew the series, and CBS swooped in and bought the rights.  CBS revamped the show, setting in the 1970s and removing the comic book ""feel"" to it.  It survived as an enjoyable, if somewhat lightweight, 70s action series for two years.
Wonder Woman: The Complete First Season includes the 2-hour pilot, the first 2 ""specials,"" and the rest of the 11 episodes from its ABC years, all set in WWII.  These episodes have tended to be the most popular, and ""wonderfully"" illustrate the show's weaknesses and considerable strengths.  On the negative side, it is clear, particularly in the first few episodes, that everyone was making everything up they went along.  Special effects are somewhat haphazard, acting can be uneven, and characters aren't fully developed.  Fortunately, all these improve as the season goes on.  On the positive side, Lynda Carter is perfect in the role.  She pulls off an extremely difficult trick, to run around in an outrageous costume and be both natural and believable.  You do not doubt her for a second.  Its also interesting to note that many big stars fought for bit parts in the series, giving various spies, senators, and saboteurs an extra degree of heft (or deliciously hammy acting!).  Most importantly, the show has, even after all these years, a considerable charm.  You can't help but smile when the great theme song with its chorus of ""Wonder Wo-MAN!"" comes in at climatic moments.  Its has the right amount of camp, adding fun without overpowering everything else.
The DVD set has few, but worthy extras.  Lynda and producer Douglas Cramer provide commentary for the pilot, and there is a short retrospective with Carter, Cramer, Alex Ross, and other notables.  The transfers are crisp, and the 70s sound is fine.  Best of all, we can finally watch these episodes in their unedited glory.  Sit back and enjoy!",1089158400,,3186,4.917602996254682
2047001,4,B0001ZMWYG,"You can't beat the color and unforgettable song to this series! Lynda Carter truly was the best choice for Wonder Woman, despite not having full acting chops. She endowed the character with an earnestness that survives the years.
The Paula von Gunther ep is easily the best, impressing me when it first appeared as now with the one-to-one adaptation of a very early WW comic. I'm quite partial to the Wonder Girl eps, starring Debra Winger, and all three are included in this set (since the character was forgotten when the series switched networks and changed time venues).
Unfortunately, eps like ""Gargantua"" are actually painful to watch. The pilot itself comes across with a very uneven view: is this a comedy, or are we playing it straight according to the comic book? It's badly directed, and the 70s effects are now, as they were then, quite cheesy. Well, some people like loads of cheese. Here it is!
Enjoy the 70's clothing sometimes being used in a 1940's venue. Watch for the camera angle changes that also accidentally disclose time of day or location/set switches. I got a kick out of seeing how many times a particular set of doors and a corridor were used during the run of the season. (Which reminds me: when is ""The Man from UNCLE"" -- which used a favorite set of stairs over and over [I think I saw it once with WW!] coming out on DVD?)
I was surprised to see the very feminist lectures (ah, so that's why the present-day comic book heroine spends most of her time lecturing!) that a behind-the-scenes commentary says was difficult for ABC to accept. Unfortunately, we also get ""treated"" to WW holding back discoveries that she has made in order to get Steve Trevor to realize them so he can get the credit and salve his male ego. Also in the Roy Rogers ep, we meet a co-ed group of kids -- but only the boys get to take part in the adventure.
I wish that the discs weren't two-sided; that makes me nervous for archival reasons. I also wish that only the discs that actually had special features (I think there are only two) would list them; the others, when you get to the ""special features"" section, says to check other discs. ???
When Wondie was good, it was a blast. Enjoy the best of WW with the excellent sound and picture quality that these DVDs have.",1089072000,,2276,4.54014598540146

Lynda Carter, the actress who played her, is such an awesome lady!  She does the acting so well....there is no one else that could ever do Wonder Woman quite so closely(even though Charisma Carpenter would come very close!!).  It is a real treat to have this show FINALLY come to DVD!  Just like the Dukes of Hazzard, the only real complaint I have about the quality of the DVDs is the sound.  While you are watching, the explosions sound really loud...but the overall sound of the voices and music are kind of low.  I guess it has to do with the age of the film or something.  Other than that, the picture is crystal clear...and the plots are still great!  I am so looking forward to Season 2!  I hope it will come out sooner than it took this one to make it to DVD!

2047016,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Wonder Woman has always been my favorite superhero. Alot of that has to do with Lynda Carter. She IS Wonder Woman. As a man in my early 30's - i can tell you that no other show has ever put a smile on my face like this has. Over the years Wonder Woman was rarely, and i mean rarely, show in reruns. And i know there was a demand for this dvd release because the first day it came out i went to Tower Records, Best Buy, Circuit City and Suncoast video and all these major chains were out of stock. They all said they sold out within hours of opening their doors on Tuesday. Finally i drove to Philadelphia and picked up a copy. What does this tell you? Hopefully that seasons 2 and 3 aren't far behind. It took Warner Brothers long enough. I am amazed at the quality of the picture. It's perfect. and i never realized that this show was a first for many things in network tv. i learned that from the commentary with Lynda Carter and the producer.
So the big question is--when is hollywood gonna get it together and make the movie? I think they should give Lynda Carter the role of the Queen of the Amazons. How cool would that be?
Dont miss out on this release. it is well worth the money.",1088812800,2,1188,4.147186147186147

My biggest complaint, however, is that the episodes themselves do not a ""scene selection"" option.  Of course, if your DVD player has the ability to directly access the chapters, this is not that big a problem.
Also, I really wish they had included the ""in the next episode of 'Wonder Woman'"" previews... I recall the one for episode 11, in which they had the shot of Wonder Woman being chloroformed, and the dramatic voiceover threatening ""is this the end of Wonder Woman?"" ... I was a nervous wreck for the following week.",1088726400,2,727,4.635658914728682
2047018,5,B0001ZMWYG,"As a child of the 70s, of course I did not miss this show.  However, unlike Batman, Wonder Woman did not enjoy the reruns over the last 25 years, so very few have seen the series since its original run.  Memory did not prepare me for the over-the-top cheesiness of this show.  After 10 minutes, I realized that Wonder Woman at times makes Batman look like Citizen Kane!!  There's the inane dialogue, plot lines that are way beyond suspension of disbelief, and of course the ""doll in the glass plane"" shots of WW in her invisible jet.  And seeing Lynda Carter nearly stumbling after her ""spin"" into WW during the first few episodes is worth the price of admission.  The appearance of Morticia Adams, Dr. Bellows and Mike Brady (among other sitcom icons) in one DVD is likewise a treat; and the video quality is simply amazing.
Needless to say, my 6 and 4 year old daughters already worship this show!!  Where do I sign up to pre-order Season 2??",1088726400,,944,4.517647058823529
2047019,4,B0001ZMWYG,"Wonder Woman is a classic piece of 70's television.  Lynda Carter stars in the title role and her stunning good looks and super costume brought notoriety to herself and the show. The first year of the show takes place during World War II and centers around disrupting Nazi plots.  Wonder Woman premiered as a 90 minute TV movie in November 1975.  In it, Major Steve Trevor's (Lyle Waggoner) plane is forced to land on Paradise Island in the Bermuda Triangle.  The island is home to Amazon women among them Princess Diana (Ms. Carter).  Upon learning of the Nazi threat, the queen (Cloris Leachman), holds a contest to determine a champion to send back to America to help fight the Nazis.  Diana wins and heads to American with Major Trevor.  The first Nazi plot they foil is an attempt by the Nazis to destroy an important bombsite.  The show reappeared in April 1976 for a two episode run that featured maybe the show's most popular episode, ""Fausta: The Nazi Wonder Woman"", in which an evil Nazi female operative (Lynda Day George) is sent to America to capture Wonder Woman, learn the secrets of her powers and brainwash her into helping the Nazi cause.  After that episode, the show went on hiatus until October 1976 when the first season's final eleven episodes were run until February 1977.  The second season came back in September, but it was changed and updated to the modern day.  During the first season, a whole slew of television stars guested on the show including Robert Reed, Red Buttons, Henry Gibson, Anne Francis, Dick Van Patten, Carolyn Jones, John Hillerman and surprising Roy Rogers.  A young Debra Winger appears in one of her very first roles as Wonder Girl.",1088726400,3,1683,4.745704467353952
2047020,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Wonder Woman, you could not have returned to the world at a better time (Thanks WB!).  We've presently got lots of liars whom you need to make tell the truth and the old red, white, and blue can use all the help it can get thanks to the schemes of some really rotten men whom we implore you to open a can of whup-ass on.
This is an EXCELLENT DVD set!
I'd have very much liked for them to do a full physical restoration (and digital enhancement) of the original film stock (And zap out those damn wires that you can see coming from the wings of the Invisible Plane!) but what's contained here is certainly acceptable enough and is sharper than anything that we ever saw on television.  The new documentary and commentary on the Pilot are both fabulous.
I first started my re-acquisition of this series through the Columbia House release and continued my subscription right up through the first few episodes of the second season.  I've found that the only must-have episodes are those episodes involving Paradise Island because (other than The Man From Outer Space episodes) this series was fairly self-contained on a episode to episode basis with little in the way of extended arc continuity.  I'm looking forward to the Season 2 and Season 3 DVD releases because (as far as I'm concerned) the costume didn't get perfected until then and also her fighting the Nazi's in the 1940's got to be really lame.
This series was an important piece of my childhood and became an important part of the foundation for my feminist philosophy in many ways.  As a friend of mine once wisely observed: ""Wonder Woman, girls, women, and gay men wanted to be her.  And straight men wanted to marry her!""
Now, when are we going to get the deluxe treatment on The Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman Television Series?",1088726400,2,1804,4.604361370716511

It is obvious that painstaking time and effort was taken with the set and the result is awesome! The picture clarity and the extras are great, especially hearing Lynda Carter and Douglas Cramer recall their memories of the show. For me it was like watching the show for the first time when I was three or four! I just hope that Warner Bros. knows how truly grateful we fans are to finally be able to own this piece of TV history and they will see the true demand for the subsequent seasons! Well worth the money. Buy it, take a day off from work to watch the whole thing and revel in the nostalgia!!!",1088640000,2,745,4.328571428571428
2047022,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I'll begin this by saying that I am a bit biased as a die-hard Lynda Carter fan.  However, I was so impressed with the DVD release of WW Season 1.  The clarity and the vibrance of the colors is absolutely amazing.  Lynda's comments during the pilot movie were wonderfully informative.  It was also interesting to hear the surprise in her voice as she saw scenes that she had forgotten!  I wish that Lynda had provided commentary on more episodes, but perhaps Warner Brothers will include more commentary in the release of seasons 2 and 3!!
Although I know every episode by heart, I was still glued to the set just as I was during the original airing of these shows in the 70's--a real testament to Lynda's portrayal of the character.
The ""retrospective"" was also a welcome bonus.  It was great to see Lynda and all of the others talking about the impact of the series.  I felt that Lynda was really given a lot of credit for the incredible work she did in making us believe in Wonder Woman.
I am very, very pleased with this release and recommend it to everyone.  It is a classic!!  Warner Brothers, please don't delay in bringing us the remaining seasons of the show!!  Also, give us some outtakes and photo galleries as well--the more bonus materials the better!!",1088640000,4,1265,4.557522123893805
2047033,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I have been waiting for the Wonder Woman series to debut on DVD, and thankfully, the wait is over. This DVD is worth every bit of effort or money spent to get it. The nostaligia alone os worth it!
The pilot episode features an audio commentary by Lynda Carter and producer Douglas S. Cramer. They both offer very interesting tid-bits of the casting, and production of the pilot, and at several points they marvel at sceenes and moments they have long forgotten. It's alomost as if they are in the room with you as you remember sceenes you have forgtten.
Aside from the pilot are the original 13 episodes that followed in the first ""season"", two of which feature Debra Winger's debut as Wonder Girl. The DVD also includes a mini featurette detailing the origins of the Wonder Woman t.v. movie, and subsequent epsiodes. It features interviews with Cramer, and the STILL very youthfull Lynda Carter, who expresses an inrterest in seeing a Wonder Woman movie made in the future, a wish many of us fans share, i'm sure.
All in all, this is an extremely enjoyable DVD, and a testament to the staying power of this wonderful t.v. series. I guess it's a matter of time before the second season is released. HOPEFULLY !",1088640000,3,1210,4.632558139534884

I was 4 or 5 years old when I would watch this show and did the twirling thing that she would to to transform herself into WW.I put the dvd on and my 4 year old daughter was watching it and the next thing you know there she was spinning around and chanting ""Wonder Woman!"" she absolutely loves it! The shows special effects are of course primitive by todays standards but you still enjoy it nonetheless. Lynda Carter is the only person that I could ever imagine who could be WW.Time hasn't touched her she still looks amazing! I sure hope they release all the seasons that were televised. If you grew up in the seventies I know it will bring back old memories.",1088553600,,710,4.266666666666667
2047035,5,B0001ZMWYG,"I admit, when I was 9 and this show was on I used to spin around hoping, just hoping I'd turn into Wonder Woman. Never happened :)
So far I have only watched the Documentary, the Pilot and the first episode. but from the moment I heard the theme again I was transported back to the townhouses in Port Coquitlam, glued to the TV whenever the show was on. To finally have this on DVD is bliss beyond measure. Watching the Documentary Lynda Carter is still as beautiful as she ever was. I am a bit sorry they couldn't get Lyle Waggoner to be part of it as well. I believe he was one of my first big crushes.
If Wonder Woman means as much to you as it does to me, this is a must buy.",1088553600,3,679,3.9635036496350367
2047036,4,B0001ZMWYG,"How wonderfully nostalgiac, campy,and fun watching this collection is!  Lynda Carter truly pulled this character off without taking herself too seriously, and the result is delightful.  Sure, it's cheeky, campy, sometimes inane, and always over-the-top, but it is NEVER boring.  Good entertainment only has to satisfy that last criterion, after all.
The picture quality is very good.  I don't rate it at excellent, because the prints used were not pristine.  The sound quality is also very good.
Look for Debra Winger's first acting gig as Wondergirl, a/k/a Drusilla, Wonder Woman's little sister, who's even more filled out in some ways than Diana, but much shorter!  Her characterization of Wondergirl is truly entertaining, and not just because the back side of her Wonder costume shows a great deal of the backside of her upper thighs.
If you like Lynda Carter, Superheroes, campy sci-fi/fantasy, or just plain ol' good fun, BUY THIS SET!  If you remember when television shows were all about hurrying home to turn the set on for that second part of the Bionic Woman or Wonder Woman show from last week, if you remember driving really big cars and not really worrying too much about gas prices, or wanted to wear your hair like Farrah Fawcett or Leif Garrett....this show will take you back to those days straightaway. And, don't forget...there were no VCR's back then.  It's worth the $30 just for that nostalgiac aspect of it.

i was only 3 years old when this aired for the 1st time in '76. the only episodes i think i ever saw were from the later seasons. this first season is all about saving the USA from the Nazi's. i don't remember any of that? its much closer to the factual comic book plot i hear.
(4 stars instead of 5 only because i don't like double sided dvd's that much. single sides have more art.)
watching this ""old"" T.V. show has made me realize how much todays tv sucks and lacks imagination. reality T.V. is wrecking the whole emersive thing that these campy old shows had.

The guys certainly did this with tender loving care. All I could do was laugh thru the chorus and the main page of the first disc. Laughter of pure joy, thankfulness and delight for now owning a great part of televised history.

POW! comic book feel to it as did the original season of the series. I also really enjoyed the retrospective on Wonder Woman, which had some very juicy tidbits about the character and her leap from comic books to television during the feminist movement. I also found the optional commentary track on the pilot episode with Lynda Carter and the show's producer fun to experience since it seemed like Ms. Carter was sitting in my living room watching it with me with all the excitement and wonder that I too had. I even appreciated the red, white & blue-themed double-sided DVD's, which I thought was a clever touch. And I should mention that the colors on the DVD transfer appear much richer than the VHS version. Which should come as no surprise. I do have to admit that my expectations were pretty low after owning the entire series on VHS (sans a couple episodes that regretfully never made it to video). But this collection on DVD is pure bliss! Thank you Ms. Carter-Altman for being such an integral part of the Wonder Woman legacy on various levels from being the creator of the now-famous transformation twirl to embodying the true essence and spirit of what Wonder Woman's creator, William Moulton Marston, had envisioned of his super heroine creation back in the early 40's. You're an inspiration to all of your adoring fans all over the world. And kudos to Warner Bros. for putting together such a great collection for true diehard fans of Wonder Woman and Ms. Carter and perhaps some new ones along the way.",1088467200,4,1645,4.795774647887324
2047041,5,B0001ZMWYG,"My 1970s television collection of DVDs could almost start and end with this -- one of my favorite super hero programs ever!  Lynda Carter was eye poppingly gorgeous as the Amazon Princess turned Nazi hunter, but more than that ... she made the show convincing with her acting chops.  Few people can pull off being a super hero without being laughable, and here's a testament to the fact you can have goofy kitschy special effects and STILL be better than half the CGI super heros around today!  Plus you get a young Debra Winger as Wonder Girl, and guest appearances galore from 70s icons like Cloris Leachman.  And of course Lyle Wagner as Steve Austin the love interest.
Included here are the first 13 episodes - set in the original comic's 1940s.  Wonder Woman was a WWII veteran in the original stories and here that remains intact.  In the 2nd and 3rd season they updated the time to the 1970s, so this set could really stand alone as the original concept and complete 1940s episodes.  You also get COMMENTARY from Lynda on the pilot along with the executive producer!  And of course you get the featurette describing the show and how it was made.
Before BUFFY saved the night, before XENA yodeled her way across mythology, and before NIKITA became a hired assassin for the government ... we had WONDER WOMAN.  She was a call to the world that women could be as powerful as men, and look a hell of a lot better fighting crime than them!  I can't wait to giggle at the doll in the invisible plane, see Wonder Woman rope someone and make them tell the truth, or deflect bullets with her bracelets!  And notice this ... she always seems to go to the SAME patch of trees to turn from Diana to Wonder Woman.

Please Warner Bros bring out the other two seasons.

Onto the show...The 1st season aka WW2 years are fabulous for their mix of action, comedy & style. In the pilot we see WW literally get in a knock down, drag out fight with Stella Stevens!

Watching them now, of course they may be dated in regards to special effects, but what comes through...still...is how charming and wonderful Lynda Carter is in the title role. I can't help but smile watching her magnetism on screen. Has an actress ever fit a iconic role more than Ms. Carter? I don't think so. This alone is worth the price of the DVD boxed set...but seeing the fun episodes and how entertaining they really are, makes it a keeper. You can have your special effects laden ""Super Hero"" movies.....give me the sweetness and strength of Ms. Carter's Diana Prince/Wonder Woman any day.",1081468800,2,788,4.676258992805756
2047062,5,B0001ZMWYG,"Created by Charles Moulton and published in DC Comics, Wonder Woman originally made her TV debut in a 1974 made-for-TV movie which starred Cathy Lee Crosby (a beautiful blonde), best known as one of the hosts from the popular '80s show ""That's Incredible!"" Lynda Carter (a stunning brunette) took over the role during  the 1975-76 season, appearing in three specials - ""The New Original Wonder Woman,"" ""Fausta, the Nazi Wonder Woman,"" and ""Wonder Woman Meets Baroness Von Gunter"" - before the title role became a regularly scheduled series the following season.

This DVD collection features Wonder Woman's complete first season which originally ran on ABC from December 18, 1976 to July 30, 1977. In this fan-favorite first season Wonder Woman assumes the secret identity of Diana Prince helping the Americans fight the Nazis. Also features love interest Major Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner), Steve's C.O. General Blankenship (Richard Eastham), comic relief Corporal Etta Candy (Beatrice Colen), and Diana's younger amazonian sister, Drusilla/Wonder Girl (Debra Winger), who was as easy on the eyes as her sister in her Wonder suit.

Everything you remember from the show's heyday is here for your viewing pleasure - Wonder Woman's incredible stength, speed and agility, bulletproof bracelets, boomerang tiara, magic lasso (""you are compelled to tell the truth""), and yes, invisible plane. Gotta love that infectious theme song and the comic-book opening main title. Many adults revisiting this classic show may scoff and snicker at the show's cheekiness at first glance but will be reminded quickly that Lynda Carter's earnest performance is what gives the show it's credibility and charm. As much a role model for young girls as Christopher Reeve's Superman was for young boys, Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman remains an American icon ""in her satin tights, fighting for our rights, and the old red, white and blue!""",1081382400,6,1912,5.303630363036303

8018917,3,B0001ZMWYG,"First,  I love the show itself.  No it isn't what the modern films with what modern CG and Gal Gadot can bring,  but I grew up on shows like these and enjoy them. Linda Carter will always be the true Wonder Woman to me. The commentary with Linda Carter on the first episode is great.  Now, the bad. The packaging the discs came in is awful. It comes with 5 single-sided discs stacked on top of each other making it difficult to put each disc away in order without having to take all other discs out, then you also have each disc sitting right on top of the other instead in it's own protected section.  I have Seasons 2 and 3 and those come in a case that folds with each double-sided disc in it's own section. What is odd is that the menu for this packaging suggests that it also should have double-sided discs. I suppose they changed the packaging and discs, but never changed the menu. It was very hard to put a 3 star rating on something that deserves a 4 or 5, but the packaging is all wrong. So be warned if you buy this.",1522713600,,1027,4.14070351758794
