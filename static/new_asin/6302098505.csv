421220,3,6302098505,"I was just 5 when I saw ""Ring of Bright Water"" and it was a great movie about a man's friendship with a playful little otter up until the end. I will never forget how upset I was when the poor otter gets killed at the end. I don't remember the details but I do remember sobbing for hours. My parents kept explaining the otter in the movie was an ""actor"" for days afterwards, but it did not help!! I don't think little kids should see this film. It's very upsetting.",1143763200,8,465,4.1208791208791204
421221,4,6302098505,"There was something about this movie, I saw it over 30 years ago, as a child, yet some images remained extremely clear in my mind. The otter, Mij, being watched through holes in a newspaper, the enormous shark. It was a movie I always wanted to share with my own children and I wasn't disappointed. The scenary is beautiful but the antics of Mij is what makes it so special, his almost human communication, his mischevious ways.

My game console obsessed, ten year old really enjoyed this movie and was as captivated by the Mij as I had been. It would be so good if movies like this were re released, maybe without the scenes that contain smoking, as they provide simple, clean entertainment. A warning though, Mij comes to a very sudden and sticky end that may upset some children.",1141171200,,782,4.546099290780142
421222,1,6302098505,We were very upset at the end when a neighbor kills the otter for no reason. It ruined the movie for us.,1132790400,14,104,3.772727272727273
421223,5,6302098505,"This is one of the most fascinating movies I've seen.  It is an early view of what it means to move toward an appreciation for the wild as opposed to moving away from it.  But beyond that Ring of Bright Water is the story of one man's transformation, a lucky (but not-always-so-lucky) sea otter's moment in the sun, a physician's very fortunate chance meeting with a sea otter and his benefactor, Graham Merrill, who is one of those rare individuals you could only hope to meet in the course of a lifeteme.

A lesson in tolerance, appreciation for those who live in the wild, and friendship.",1126569600,5,591,4.556603773584905
421224,5,6302098505,"I picked this up from one of those cheap DVD racks in a grocery store near my home.  What drew me in was the otter since I'm a ferret owner and find these ferret cousins to be equally appealing. I didn't expect it to be such a nice story with such amazing footage of the adorable otter, Mij.  I'm sure a lot of the interactions between otter and human had to be ad lib and the result is pure delight.  It's also got some really funny scenes - especially when Mij's owner is buying a train ticket to Scotland and tells the ticket booth he has a ""diving terrier"" and when Mij gets loose on the train.  The ensuing events made me realize Mr. Bean's slapstick was certainly nothing new!
The footage in Scotland is absolutely gorgeous and further convinced me I need to visit there someday.  The story does have some sad moments as other reviewers have revealed but all in all your left with a warm feeling of love between an animal and his owner and that life truly does go on.  If you've ever loved - and lost - a pet you will truly love this movie.",1088208000,11,1046,4.205
421225,5,6302098505,"I saw this movie when I was 7 years old and I never forgot it. Even at such a young age I could appreciate the humor and beauty of it. Theres just one thing, if you are buying it for a young child I would really reconsider. It had an overwhelming affect on me as a 7 year old to see Mij get killed. It was my first experience with death. I left the theater hystericaly crying,gave me nightmares and made me very fearful that people and animals I love would die. I had been looking for this movie for a long time and when I finally found it and watched it, it made me cry again,but now I can appreciate the end and how life goes on and the beauty in that. I think its a great movie but for older children (11 yrs old) and adults.",1075507200,87,728,3.925675675675676
421226,5,6302098505,"This film is a highly fictionalized version of what was actually a true story in the book of the same name by Gavin Maxwell.  As fiction, the screenplay takes dramatic license in ways both entertaining and trivializing.  But what the film does most compellingly depict is the beauty of the Scottish  shore, the uniqueness and remarkability of otters, and the life-changing relationship between a man and his otter.  I was one of the children who grew up watching the movie, ""Born Free.""  Those not of this generation may not be able to relate to the effect the movie (""Born Free"") had on our culture and our awareness of animals as conscious beings (probably had a big part in giving rise to the enthusiasm for animal rights and the animal liberation movement that occurred some years later).  I found ""Ring of Bright Water"" equally moving, albeit not for the same reasons, but for that same way of depicting animals with dignity and humor.  In the more than ten years since I've seen this movie, I never forgot it and eventually bought a copy of my own [....])",1014336000,24,1061,4.672043010752688
421227,4,6302098505,"Ring of bright water is a British film full of the images and sounds of the late 60's.  It is a wonderful story about a writer (Graham) who acquires an orphaned and much out of place young otter named Mij (pronounced Midge).  Graham decides to move and take Mij from the heart of London to a more natural setting, the coast of northwest Scotland. This story works on so many levels there is the relationship between Graham and Mij as each learns from the other about being friends. There is also the relationship between the two newcomers (Graham and Mij) and the locals.  The film takes you through a whole roller coaster of emotions.  This movie will make you laugh, smile and cry.  The end of the movie almost verges on letting you decide how the film really ended.  Hope and belief is a wondrous thing.",1008288000,32,806,4.486301369863014
421228,5,6302098505,"A middle-aged writer seeks solitude from his hectic London life, which he blames for his writer's block, to attempt his next novel.  He settles down in a quaint cottage near the water in a town so small that someone from the  street will run one of the local shops if the proprietor becomes ill.  A  young orphaned otter, Mitch, stumbles into his life and helps him learn the  true meaning of unconditional love, teaching him how to communicate and  reach out to other people.  Together they develop a closeness with the  town's veterinarian and her dog, Mitch's best friend.  The movie has a sad  ending which will melt anyone's heart; yet it tells us that as long as life  exists, there is always hope and happiness since life is not a start-stop  function, but the circularity of a cycle.",945993600,20,791,4.611510791366906

When I saw it here I just had to add it to my permanent collection.  If you believe in vicarious love for a critter half a world away, you'll fall in love with Mij.  The scenery is gorgeous, the story is moving, and there's no doubt at all that Mij is the star.

Lovely story. Adapted from a true story by Gavin Maxwell. ""Ring of Bright Water"".  A writer/artist  and his otter go to live in a remote little village on the edge of the water near the Isle of Skye in Scotland.  Beautiful scenery, music and storyline.

421360,4,6302098505,"I'd never seen this before, but bought it when it was a ""recommend"". OK, the vid takes a lot of liberties with the real story (I researched it on-line) and they change the names of those involved. The RL person the character of Graham Merrill was based on was Gavin Maxwell, and his SO was really Kathleen Raines, a fellow writer, not the town's doctor.

The beginning drags a bit, but that was done to establish how mundane Merrill's work-a-day life is. Contrasts nicely with his slowly developing infatuation with a pet shop otter. He has his doubts, and for good reason. His decision is made for him as he rushes into the shop to rescue the otter from several Germans who're discussing acquiring this otter for a circus, one of whom hints that he isn't going to be treating the otter kindly.

Graham quickly discovers that small London flats and active, inquisitive critters do not mix. Graham relocates to the Scottish countryside where the vid really takes off. The countryside is lovely. The friendship between Graham and the otter, now named Mij, really blossoms. Along a parallel line, so does the friendships between Graham and Doctor Mary, between Mij and Johnnie, Mary's dog.

Not gonna say what happens next, in case you haven't seen it yet, and don't know how it ends. However, I will say this: when you come to that scene where Mary, Mij, and Johnnie are leaving the falls for the town (Mary says she has to go to her surgery (doctor's office)) you can hit the eject button. You won't be missing much as the conclusion is otterly preposterous and not the least bit credible.

Yes, I know it's a G-rated, ""family friendly"" flick and they had to sanitize the ending since the real end of the story is too horrifying. I compare this flick with another flick, _Agora_, and how that one gave Hypatia a merciful, painless death, as opposed to what historically happened. They should have given RoBW a ""and they lived happily ever after"" type of ending. The ending of this flick is as far from the truth as though it had a fairy tale ending anyway. It is, after all, fiction based on a true story, and not the true story itself.",1405209600,,2135,4.595800524934384

So, it somewhat puzzled me to notice that, at the time of THIS writing, the average of all of its rankings, so far, was a mere 3.7 (out of a possible 5 stars).  Almost immediately, however, I began to suspect that some people either knowingly or somewhat unknowingly may have some kind of deeply ingrained personal problem with the portrayal of the film's controversial act of unwarranted brutality and slaying, just prior to the ending.  Since the expressed attitudes of the character who commits that act might be difficult to explain to a child, for those belonging to a possible majority of chronically speciesist human adults, without personally admitting that their own pretty much lifelong attitudes essentially match what was mirrored in that tragic turn of events in the movie.  I believe that THIS IS A MOVIE THAT DEFINITELY DESERVES FIVE STARS - and a lot of self reflective afterthought by a whole lot of people.",1356825600,,1232,4.903846153846154

As has been noted by other reviewers, this movie is quite charming and its simple premise is the joy of friendship flourishing amidst a beautiful backdrop of gorgeous dark hills, and brilliantly clean waters. However and here is the 'spoiler'...the otter meets his maker in a rather startlingly abrupt manner that would probably shock a child and mar them for days. I was quite stunned when I first saw that part of the movie as an adult. The movie is very easy and mild, and if not for that one tragic scene near the end I would say it would be a lovely children's film. However, it is merely a film that I would recommend only for older children, and for them it would probably lack many of the elements that hold their interest today, (action, adventure...etc.) So, I could hardly recommend this movie for children (too startling), for tweens (too flat and possibly boring), and for adults there really is no reason to see it...except that some of it is pretty.

421444,2,6302098505,"I happened across this movie on TCM last night and immediately became entranced by the story and especially by Midge, a wonderful pet otter full of life and personality, and also impossibly cute.  I was really enjoying it, but after Graham rescues Midge from a near drowning in the middle of the movie, I had a sense of foreboding in the back of my mind.  Sure enough, at the end of the movie, Midge is murdered by a fool named Angus who states after the murder that ""It's just an otter.""

I was sickened and saddened by this turn in the story, something I've seen all too often in movies over the years.  Why is it that movie makers continually resort to the gratuitous killing of animals to ""drive"" their stories?  Midge's death in this movie served absolutely no purpose and is gratuitous in the worst sense of the word.  Time and time again this crops up in movies, and I'm not talking about movies like ""Hachi: A Dog's Tale"" or ""Marley and Me.""

I give this movie 2 stars only because of the beautiful cinematography and the utter charm of Midge the otter.  I could only consoled myself with the knowledge that it's just a movie and Midge didn't really die.  In fact, I think Midge doubled as the otter we see at the end of the movie.

Surprisingly, Mij is killed.  However, you, and everyone, and everything, you will ever know will also die. (Though hopefully not before your time.)  In my belief, how you deal with death, and how you talk to your children about it is the more important thing.

Mij's children live on in happiness though, and that is an important aspect of the movie, and one which can be reinforced with children. That is the cycle of life we are all part of.

421486,4,6302098505,"I recently saw this DVD on the sale rack at my local grocery store.  The adorable picture of the otter on the cover caught my eye right away, and the description on the back cover spoke of fun and frolic and friendship and adventure.  I thought it sounded like an uplifting movie about the love people share with companion animals (a subject for which I've always held strong affection since I've always been a nature and animal lover).  So I bought the DVD and looked forward to watching the movie at home.

The opening segment is slow, but maybe that was done intentionally to covey the tedium of Graham's job and routine, and to establish the foundation of how his life is ripe for a change.

The otter, Mij, is adorable and enchanting from the very first moment he appears onscreen.

The movie really takes flight when Graham leaves his tedious job and big city life in London, and relocates to the stunning beauty of coastal Scotland.  Mij blossoms in a natural environment, and the bond between Mij and Graham grows very strong.  The shots of the otter frolicking in nature are easily the best of the whole film, and the cinematography of the Scottish highlands and shimmering seascapes is magnificent.

The relationship between Graham and Dr. Mary MacKenzie is handled beautifully.  Their friendship blooms into love, and their love is enacted onscreen in a refreshingly subtle manner.  And the friendship between Mij and the doctor's dog, Johnny, is very charming.

**Plot Spoiler**

So after all the enchantment of the animals, nature scenery, and the blossoming love between Graham and the doctor described above, imagine the surprise and utter shock when, as Mij and Johnny are playing and chasing each other through the grass and along the road on their way back home, Mij is suddenly, shockingly, brutally bludgeoned to death by an extremely ignorant ditch-digger.  I don't know if it's possible to describe how unprepared we as the viewers are for what happens to Mij, nor the shock over the senselessness of it.  I was completely appalled by the atrocity and brutality of it.  Nothing on the packaging or advertising, nor anything in the movie up to that point, had even hinted at this.  One minute Mij and his best friend are playing happily; the next Mij is brutally, senselessly, horribly murdered.  It happens so suddenly I almost couldn't even believe it.  And I couldn't stop crying for almost an hour afterwards.

I suppose this was done as a commentary on the ignorance of people who don't understand the love, companionship, and dignity of companion animals/pets.  To that end, it certainly was effective (too effective, in my personal opinion).  But for the pure cinematic value of this story, and perhaps because the film's leading actor and actress were also the leads of ""Born Free,"" I as the viewer had been watching and somewhat anticipating that the movie might build to a conclusion where perhaps Mij is released into the wild to live as a free otter.  The scene where Mij encounters a female otter on the beach almost seemed to hint at such a possibility.  When the movie ended with a female otter following her 3 baby otters as they instinctively headed to the pool in the stream where Mij used to swim (and where Mij seemed to be his happiest), and the beautiful ballad played during the credits as the exquisitely-filmed scenes of the otters at play in the water continued, there was  a bittersweetness to see Mij's babies following in their father's behavior, but knowing that Mij himself never got to see his children, and also that Graham wouldn't be able to have the same bond with them (the scene where Graham sees an otter emerge from the water, and calls out ""Mij!"" but gets no response from the otter confirms that Mij is truly gone). But Mij's life was not in vain since he was loved, happy, and fathered beautiful babies.  In his short life, Mij brought much life and love to live on in all around him.

I still give this movie 4 out of 5 stars, only taking off the 5th star due to the brutality of Mij's killing as described above.  Animal and nature lovers will still enjoy the wonderful scenes of Mij at play, and the beauty of the Scottish seascape.  Just be sure to watch this movie with a box of tissues close at hand.

**Update**

After writing this review, I began to research this film, and the book it was based on, and I learned that sadly this was a true story and that the real Mij was indeed killed just as depicted in the movie.  While I now understand that this means they had to include this heartbreaking episode in the film, it also makes the tragedy that much greater to know it really happened in real life.  Mij was adopted in 1956 and killed in 1957... yet he is immortalized forever in the book by the author who adopted and loved him, and in this movie, and also in the memorial statue of the real Mij on the beautiful Scottish seashores where he frolicked.  Thank you, Mij, for teaching us all about love and pure joy... in your too-short time here on earth, you managed to leave a legacy that will live forever.

The location is beautiful, I admit, though the filming is harsh and contrasty. Maybe the DVD is better quality than the VHS, which is what I watched. All in all, really a ham-fisted rendering of the book.

I've only started the book, but so far it is quite different from the movie (does not start in London, for example).

421496,4,6302098505,"After the success of the 1966 British film ""Born Free,"" which starred real-life couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna, is it any wonder that the similarly-themed ""Ring of Bright Water"" came out a few years later in 1969?

THE STORY: Travers plays a writer in London who is strangely drawn to an otter in a pet store window. After purchasing the animal he decides to leave the city to give them both some much-needed breathing space. They move to desolate coastal Scotland where he fixes up a shack to make it liveable. There they develop a relationship with another animal-lover, a rural doctor played by McKenna. Adventures ensue.

""Ring of Bright Water"" is a must for animal/nature fans. The film features a good assortment of animals, although otters are the main item. In addition the picture features some beautiful rural Scotland photography (filmed on location, of course).

Personally, I can relate to the protagonists' love for the otter and other cute & cuddly critters. A family of woodchucks (aka groundhogs) used to live by us until last May and we would get much enjoyment out of watching them, especially each Spring when the mother would have 5-7 cubs. We've become so familiar with woodchucks that we often spot them on our drives in the country. If you know what to look for you'll spot woodchucks almost every day in the Northeast. One day this past August we spotted ten woodchucks in ten minutes (!). But I digress.

""Ring of Bright Water"" is a quiet film, a breath of fresh air in this age of special-effects laden extravaganzas. To appreciate it you have to be in the mood for something that glorifies nature and is generally laid-back. The film is certainly family-friendly but, be forewarned, it has edge. This is a good thing, to me at least.

For one thing, there's a sequence where the couple goes out to an island looking for their missing otter (named Mij), who naturally went off looking for a babe. The sequence takes on an ominous vibe with mysterious shots of the ancient landscape.

Other reviewers rightly point out that the film ultimately takes an unexpected dark turn (even though it still ends on a positive note). Some have even given the dvd a low rating for this reason. I defend this ""dark turn"" for a number of reasons. For one thing it does give the film an edge. By this point in the story things had become a bit lull; something shocking NEEDED to happen.

I don't want to give away the ending so don't read the next paragraph if you haven't seen the film yet.

[SPOILER ALERT!] I found the ending uplifting despite the otter's death; in fact, it delivers quite a few important messages. The message of Mij's death is revealed in the words of the old man who killed him; he states, ""Oh, I didn't know it was your pet; I just thought it was an otter."" In other words, he killed the beautiful creature for no legitimate reason at all; just because Mij happened by him. This is a tendency of the fallen nature of human beings; it's ignorance & hostility and it must change if this world is to ever improve. Aside from this the ending shows the couple discovering that Mij had a mate and kids. His life begat life; and that life continues despite Mij's death. Another message is that perhaps otters should stay in the wild rather than become our pets; if Mij wasn't a pet he wouldn't have needlessly died the way he did. Yet another lesson is the cold fact of death in this world. Children (and people in general) need to learn and accept the reality of death sooner or later, why not sooner? The film opens the door for parents to discuss this important subject with their kids. It powerfully illustrates how death can happen at any time and can be quite a shock. We all know of friends and loved ones who have died suddenly, without warning, and what a shock it was to deal with. This movie preps us all for this inevitable happening. [END SPOILER].

Bad ending? No way; it's an important and necessary ending.

The film was based on the book of the same name. The ending sort of explains the strange title but IMHO they should have come up with a better title. ""Born to Frolic and Swim Free"" perhaps. Just joking, but just about anything would be better than ""Ring of Bright Water.""

Another highlight is the moving acoustic folk song played during the credits, which I assume (from the lyrics) is also titled ""Ring of Bright Water."" This is a simple yet magnificent & timeless piece, and the singer has a stirring voice.

The film runs 1 hour and 44 minutes.

Yes the end is sad, but it's life and reality and you'll gain an admiration for otters and all wild creatures that will really move you to tears.

Have you seen the famous ""Otters Holding Hands"" clip? If not you may really choose it as a youtube  favorite.

It's a movie reminiscent of ""Born Free"" and if you liked ""Born Free"", you'll also treasure this.",1204243200,14,883,4.368098159509202

Further to the above, I watched this movie for the first time with my boyfriend (per the above comment).  I loved the movie. My mom had read the book when she was at school and I can't wait to watch the movie again with her. I am sure it will touch her as much as it did me.

Many thanks for keeping the older movies in stock... what would we do without fond memories!",1201132800,,525,3.980952380952381
421532,5,6302098505,"I saw this film many times in a TV edit when I was young, and loved the film very much. Even with the heart break and the hurt that the arc of the film travels through, I think its a great gateway to two superb books, the original RING OF BRIGHT WATER and THE ROCKS REMAIN THE SAME; both of these books detail much that is not shown in the film. And whilst I know its not an exact replica of the book, the film has some great moments, with nary a time that drags or lapses due to the beautiful photography.
I am a little ambivalent about the much mentioned scene that hints at Midges death; its not explicit, but it is clear that Midge has been killed. But wether or not a child should watch this is a parental decision, since I know that some kids will deal with it, and yes they will cry at the scene, any human with heart will cry at that scene, so do we keep some Adults away from the film? Its all a matter of if the person watching can deal with the issues. The key for me, in my view, is that the Film should inspire the watcher to delve into the books. I know that for me, I loved the first book, which the film is based on, and I found that I loved the 1963 British edition very much, and tried successfully in many cases to get good copies as gifts. Gavin Maxwell gave us much in his books, and the inspired legacy of the film is just part of what he did, and I for one am grateful for a masterpiece like this existing, one that warms the heart as much as it may break it; Gavin Maxwell gives us a taste of his life.",1198022400,2,1526,3.957792207792208
421533,4,6302098505,"I was taken to this film as a child when it first came out. I remember being entranced by the beauty of Scotland and the cuteness of the otter, but the senseless and brutal killing of the animal at the end shocked and disturbed me, and left a lasting bad memory. I later thought I was maybe a bit sensitive, but these other reviews confirm that it left the same impression on other viewers. I now have small children of my own. They will not be watching this (otherwise excellent) movie.",1184803200,5,487,4.362637362637362

Because parents need to know these things, I must address this. This movie's description makes it sound like ""Andre"" or some other cute movie about a wild animal taken in by a family. Well, it is ... right up until the point where - out of the clear blue sky - the cute little otter is bludgeoned to death.

Parents of small children MUST know these things going in or they will have some seriously messed up kids. My wife watched it alone first and it traumatized HER! She's still angry that I even brought it in the house. I may not have if I'd had some warning on the video cover but it only talks about fun, mischief and frolic, not violence, tragedy and grief. Those subjects are legitimate topics for films but there should be some kind of heads-up.

The quality of the film isn't the problem, nor is the unflinching realism of it. It's the misleading advertising.",1184803200,34,882,4.46583850931677
421535,5,6302098505,"Graham (Bill Travers) works with cranky computers and reams of paper, but he doesn't realize just how dreary his hamster-wheel existence is until he sees a sea otter in the window of a pet store. The otter is taken with him, and vice versa. After several days of playing peek-a-boo through the plate glass, Graham is in the front of the pet store when he overhears some circus trainers discussing buying the otter and forcing him to perform in their show. He immediately dashes into the shop and buys the otter. Graham quickly learns that small London flats and active otters do not mix. Once ensconced in a remote seaside region of Scotland, the man and the otter thrive.

Then, tragedy strikes. This is a serious tearjerker, but the pain is worth it. ROBW not only stands the test of time, it encourages reading (Gavin Maxwell's book is superb) and leads to many interesting avenues (if you haven't seen it, you'll want to watch Travers in Born Free).",1181865600,2,953,4.6726190476190474
421536,5,6302098505,"I loved this distinctly British take on the cute fuzzy animal story -- the wry humor was bracing and much less gooey than comparable American versions.  As other reviewers have noted, the film is not without a traumatic window into the cruelty of human interactions with nature.  I cried my eyes out, but what I love about this film is that it captures the magnificence of Scotland and charm of the otter without the Disneyesque sugar-coating.  Anyone who is moved by animals and nature is bound to have their heart broken, because nature is cruel, humans are worse, and nothing lasts anyway.  But this film provides more than ample inspiration that one should not let the sadness of these losses diminish one's pleasure in nature's limitless diversity and beauty.  But I agree that it is inappropriate for sensitive children.",1175299200,,826,4.913669064748201
421537,4,6302098505,"This is a wonderful animal adventure movie with some humans stories thrown in for good measure. This is mainly about a tame sea otter, but to stretch it out we have his owner go from living in the crowded city to the beautiful Scottish countryside. Just remember you will become attached to the otter that will be brutally killed at the end of the movie. Heartbreaking for young adults and adults, devastating to children. So not for small children. I would recommend 8 or older.",1174262400,,479,4.647058823529412
421538,4,6302098505,"If you enjoy a good clean wholesome film that does not contain any sex, violence, explosions or people shooting other people, one that can remind you that life is not all about dealing with terrorism and counter-terrorism and one that contains some quite stunning photography showing off the beauty of Scotland then you really should not miss this one!

The general synopsis is that a gentleman by the name of Graham Merril (played by Bill Travers) who lives and works in London and is accustomed to and somewhat beleaguered by the so-called 'rat race', spots an otter for sale in a pet shop.  At first he tries hard to ignore the animal but the otter always seems to show great enthusiasm whenever he passes by the shop window.  Latterly he gives in and buys the otter (whom he calls Mij) but soon he finds that his small London flat is completely unsuitable for keeping such an animal - as does his landlady.

He leaves his job and buys a cottage on the North West Coast of Scotland and when he gets there, finds that it is in quite a bad state of repair.  He works hard in restoring the cottage (whose outlook on to the Western Isles is quite stunning) and settles in to his new job of being a writer.  Meanwhile Mij is seen in many wonderful shots thoroughly enjoying his new home.  The requirement to purchase some Methylated Spirits for his lamp takes him to the local doctor's surgery where he meets the General Practitioner Mary (played by Virginia McKenna) with whom he soon falls in love.  The film is refreshingly clean by today's standards and their love for each other is only really hinted at.

A thoroughly enjoyable film that will take your mind off all the troubles of the world.",1170806400,,1696,4.552631578947368
