8514713,5,B007CXQ7HS,Great Blu Ray that plays on US Blu-Ray players. It has English subtitles. One of the funniest French movies I've seen. The best part of the movie involves Gerard Depardieu - when he thinks the bad luck that follows Pierre Richard might be contagious... There are quite a few Gaumont Blu Rays that are multi-Region (including US) and have subtitles. Shipping is acceptable from Amazon France.

8514714,1,B007CXQ7HS,How does one sell a foreign DVD in America without emphasizing that it doesn't have subtitles in English?  I'm very unhappy at this point.,1415318400,3,138,4.75
8514715,5,B007CXQ7HS,I love the french comedies from the years '60-70s (mainly with Louis de Funes and Pierre Richard). They are the best! :),1364601600,,120,4.5
