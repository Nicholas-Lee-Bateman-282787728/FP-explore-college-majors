Now, almost 20 years later, the tape is ready to be thrown out. I'm SO glad I found it again. I've been searching for years. I hope that, someday, there will be a dvd release of this title. That way, it'll last a lifetime.

The story itself is about a young boy who grew up never knowing who his real father was. One cold evening, he was met by a huge flying head who claimed to be the spirit from the Land of Far Away. This spirit then took the young boy to this magical land, where he discovered that his father was the king and that his  own real name is Mio. This once flourishing land was now in deep peril, caused by the appearance of an Evil Knight. It's up to Mio and his new friend Jum Jum (pronounced Yum Yum) to put a stop to his evil doings.

This film is truly a marvel of its time. I still love watching it as an adult. It takes you to a world that only your imagination can go. I highly recommend it as a family film, but, as for very young children, it may be best to keep this title out of reach. It does get a bit creepy and scary in some parts. All in all, a must have for any movie collection.",1123027200,,1243,3.9246031746031744

The only part of the title i could remember was far away and so i kept ending up with the tom cruise movie.  anyways this was one of my favorite movies as a child!  it is sooooo good.  i highly recommend it.  it is the type of movie for kids who like The Labyrinth, The Narnia Chronicles and A Wrinkle in Time, fantasy type books.  It is a good buy!",993427200,,472,3.8541666666666665
7926723,5,B00004Y6BQ,"I watched this movie over and over as a kid and never got sick of it! I always dreamed of going there, hehe. Since I'm Swedish maybe it's easier for me to relate to it since the original author, Astrid Lindgren is Swedish and I've read all her books and seen all her movies and know the way she writes. It's a magic story and I truly love it! The music is great too. I own a copy myself and I recommend ppl with kids to let them watch it. Maybe not for small children since there are some 'scary' parts.",986774400,,503,3.99009900990099
