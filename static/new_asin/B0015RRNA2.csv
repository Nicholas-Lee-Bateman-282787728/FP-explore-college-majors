8259745,4,B0015RRNA2,"Writer/Director Carl Thibault has made a really good film. I just watched this movie at the San Joaquin Film Festival and it blew me away. The basic story is not new. Set in a small town in Texas in the late 70s, the main character, Matt, must make the most important choice of his life. He can stay buried in the going-nowhere job of mechanic in his father's run-down auto repair garage or he can escape to the outside world and rise above the dead end life he's destined for. This film is beautifully photographed, acted, directed, written, edited, and scored. It never has that feel of low budget. Thibault's excellent film is independent cinema at its best. I actually give this picture 4 and a half stars.",1212710400,9,710,4.5546875
