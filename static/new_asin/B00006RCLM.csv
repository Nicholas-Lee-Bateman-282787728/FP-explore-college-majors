1789860,5,B00006RCLM,Arrived in good time. Looks great. Haven't watched it because it's a Christmas gift.  Trust all is well.,1156377600,,104,4.777777777777778
1789861,2,B00006RCLM,"this is a good dvd, although if you are going to buy a dvd of elvis buy Elvis king of entertainment. it has just about the same material except with better quality, if you are collecting it is worth while, if not I suggest Elvis King of Entertainment,",1151625600,10,251,4.25
1789862,5,B00006RCLM,Title fits the DVD. Rare unseen footage. Its really cool seeing parts of Elvis's life that would normally not be shown on TV.,1127865600,4,125,4.478260869565218
1789863,5,B00006RCLM,"This video contains a large amount of hard to find video clips of Elvis doing everything EXCEPT singing. You will recognize a lot of these films which have been shown in various news stories or Elvis documentaries for just a few seconds, but they are almost never used in their entirety.  Really cool old teen music shows and interview shows he appeared on in the late 1950's, comedic sketches from appearances on comedy shows, appearances on other performers' television specials, etc.  Features several 1970's press conferences that are almost never seen on television - or anyplace else.  Also features a lot of other performers and television personalities who were at the height of their careers at the time Elvis appeared with them.  If you want to see how really cool Elvis was,  - even in comparison to everyone else in show business, -  then this is one video worth buying.",1123286400,34,882,4.846666666666667
1789874,3,B00006RCLM,too much like the first one I bought,1413849600,,36,3.625

1789876,3,B00006RCLM,This was almost the same video as Elvis King of Entertainment except without the music But It was ok I wouldn't purchase this one again I never thought I'd say that about Elvis items but sorry not as good as all others maybe because of lack of music,1405123200,5,249,4.208333333333333
1789877,5,B00006RCLM,"i became an Elvis fan in 1956, when i saw him on TV.  They only filmed him from the wast up.... Never did do anything wrong that I saw. He was just captivating the audience.",1382313600,,173,3.942857142857143
1789878,5,B00006RCLM,"Loved this dvd. Felt like family as I viewed this. Brought back so many memories of Elvis and special times in my life as well Memories, sweet memories.",1371168000,,152,4.464285714285714
1789879,3,B00006RCLM,My husband is a super Elvis fan and he was sort of disappointed with this.  He thought it would be  a little different.,1368489600,,119,4.130434782608695
1789880,4,B00006RCLM,"I found this enjoyable even though all the footage is pretty raw. It's like an amateur VHS compilation
of the best Elvis appearances (no music performances). It's great how it all chronological - beginning to the end.
It's worth watching and keeping.

I watched this DVD and Elvis on Tour the same night for the first time and enjoyed this better, really.

Snag your 1 cent DVD today!",1316131200,,384,4.632352941176471
1789881,1,B00006RCLM,"This is just exerpts from longer versions of scenes that are in the better documentaries. I fast forwarded through it, realizing I had already seen it all, and then tossed it. Not rare at all.",1180915200,5,192,4.514285714285714
1789882,2,B00006RCLM,"'Elvis:  Rare moments with the King,' is published by the same company that released 'Elvis: King of Entertainment'.  It is shorter and repeats the highlights of the latter.  With almost no musical samples, the '...Rare Moments...' is almost more an archive of Elvis's sociological importance.  It is interesting to see him interviewed on guest TV performances, but '...King of Entertainment...' has all of the best moments presented here plus some snippets of musical and film performances.

(3 1/2 *'s)  Get instead:  'Elvis: King of Entertainment,' which is more of a documentary than it is a compilation of performances.  An overview of the highlights of his life, his career, his performances, and his movies, it makes a fine sampler.  Interspersed with television performances and interviews, it is a testament to the phenomena that Elvis is and was.  The only drawback is that the brief touches of each highlight will only be a tease and never totally satisfying.  Seeing footage of his army induction, his wedding, and early as well as Las Vegas performances are an interesting draw.",1176681600,9,1091,5.142045454545454
1789883,5,B00006RCLM,"I loved this dvd.  It shows all the t.v. news clips and interviews in full format.

I do :)",1161129600,15,276,4.169811320754717

7972771,4,B00006RCLM,"I have seen some of the video recordings before. Except for the WINK MARTINDALE INTERVIEW, which I have heard about on Sirus XM radio the ELVIS CHANNEL from Wink himself several times. But I never seen it, it is on this DVD and there a quite a few more they seem to be in there entire  length, hard to know I wasn't there or heard about all of these. Historically interesting.",1461974400,2,376,4.295774647887324
