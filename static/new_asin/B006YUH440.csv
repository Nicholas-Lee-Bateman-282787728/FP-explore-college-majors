8506602,4,B006YUH440,I ordered this thinking it was a summary of the Diamond Jubilee events in London. This turned out to be something related but different. But I like it. It arrived on time and in good condition. It is a good addition to our library.,1359158400,,231,4.2727272727272725
8506603,1,B006YUH440,"I returned the Diamond celebration blu-ray disk from a supplier through Amazon, it had audio, subtitles were fine, however, absolutely no picture throughout. I went from section to section still no picture. The return process was easy and efficient, thank you Amazon.

I purchased the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Celebration again, this time from a different supplier through Amazon. Exact same problem as the 1st time, I can not believe it the exact same problem. My blu-ray disk player works fine.

Same problem twice, from two different supplies, I got to believe the product is faulty.",1347753600,,588,5.114583333333333
