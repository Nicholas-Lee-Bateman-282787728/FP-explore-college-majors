Of the official Dylan recordings, Winston appears only on the Unplugged album (1994), on My Blue-eyed Jane on the Jimmie Rogers Tribute album, The Songs of Jimmie Rogers (1997), and on one track of Time Out of Mind (1997), but he played drums with the live band for four years from 1992 to 1996. He brought great energy to what he calls the best seat in the house (the drummers stool)  so much so that he was given a break off-stage when Bob played acoustic numbers  and at least twice drew from Bob (when introducing the band) variations on this comment: I thought this guy was Ice-T when I hired him. When I found out he wasn't it didn't matter, he plays so good. And play good he did, in the opinion of most people other than Van Morrison, who Winston credits with a major part in his decision finally to quit.

This DVD provides a lot of information about what it was like to tour with Bob Dylan (and for the most part probably still is). Winston is a great interviewee with much to say about his fellow band members, some of the touring crew  the tour organization was 'a very well-oiled, squeeky little machine. I didn't have to worry about anything except playing drums  and we see inside the musicians tour bus, hotel rooms and concert venues, the places they visited, and hear about celebrity visitors, and the bands own visit to a Rolling Stones concert, where Bob was much impressed by the fire-breathing cobra that towered over the stage. Winston is at pains to emphasize that he found Bob warm, communicative and supportive. He was and remains a fan.

Drummers and aspiring drummers will be pleased to hang on to the tit-bits Winston drops about his art, wishing there were more; non-drummers may be glad to know this is no earnest how to video.

Winston also introduces us to his own family. We are honored, and we discover that this African-American combines several totally unexpected origins too. Again, it doesnt get too much; the whole video is very skillfully edited and produced.

Most of the background music is provided by the band Highway 61, the Dylan tribute band largely made up of former Dylan support musicians. Of course, they are not and could never be the same without Bob, so its definitely for the best that the soundtrack is mostly just rhythmic backing music.",1456444800,,2540,4.622222222222222
8401761,4,B003OYBM4M,"Before we get into the review of the DVD I'd like to state in 1995 Winston Watson was the drummer in Dylan's band and for that year in particular there wasn't a bad show infact every show dylan performed that year was like a 5 star performance each night...how i know this i used to collect bob dylan shows and listen to them and there never was a clunker...shows from 1993-1994 were great too but not quite as impassioned as 1995 for whatever reason...so having said that leaves alot of thanks and graditude toward the drummer...far as the DVD goes it was interesting and a behind the scenes look at how dylan works and thinks alot of the questions are addressed in the film, the only reason i gave it 4 stars in my opinion a little short on footage with most of it being home footage, would've loved to have heard live material but maybe copyright comes into play so it wasn't allowed...but in the end it was sad how winston watson left the band due to perhaps hateful comments made by van morrison who's really a man totally full of himself as proved by his work...at one time he was a great songwriter but those days have long passed by...i was a little saddened that winston watson has returned to being an electrician because he's a better drummer than that, perhaps simple but like dylan said he has a good vibe...i'd like to think winston watson did leave the dylan band and wasn't fired but i can understand his discomfort level as he was never given a contract or a container? he never mentioned that...a container is you get paid even when the band isn't touring so you'd remain with the band...i'm frustrated at the MTV show he said wasn't released couldn't find anything that he was talking about eg said there was a cover if i were a carpenter.",1410220800,,1758,4.462732919254658
