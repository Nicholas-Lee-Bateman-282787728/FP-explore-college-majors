7795296,2,0988143801,Here i will make some comments some reviewers couldn't know or may have overlooked. First the one who made the movie invited somebody into there life for help and then as soon as some of there issues came up spent most of the time trying to knock down bhagavan das. He tryed to justify himself in various ways. He had studied some psychology hypothesis. Yes even if its popular its hypothesis. He got the opinions of lost souls making some money in the spiritual supermarket. One even backed a false prophet. Lost spiritualy sleeping false prophet so and so came up with this model of thinking it means something..Also richard alpert may have old issues with bhagavan das especialy rejection and tied in with that jealousy. This new kid to spiritual seeking spends the bulk of the tine trying to belittle the guy he asked please help me. Next bhagavan das shouldt be tied in with guru scandals where someone says there a celibate but arent. He was open about his desires and what he did. If non intoxicated consenting adults agree to sex they have agreed. If the female hasent figured out how quick a guy will use them for sex by the time there an adult they are going around blind. Add to that the desire for 15 minutes of fame. Next is the value of the movie for bhagavan das. Certainly not a perfect guru as the saying goes. He had in his psyche linked himself with spiritualy corrupt aghory sadhus. Spending a month at a cremation ground doesnt make you an aghory. Also many of the modern agorys are corrupt using alsohol etc in the name of semething spiritual. If it doesnt help purify or others it doesnt help. So loke a kid who loves to smoke marijuana finfs rasta ideas and oh im a higher man. Bhagavn das linked his anything goes from modern day spiritualy corrupt agorys to back his i can do anything and be spiritual. Which resulted in 30 years of non spiritual helpfullness to himself and others. There are the real sadhus and the corrupt for example its ok to use alcohol and eat anything corrupt sadhus. Bhagavan das has a unique psyche like saul of the bible. Not as pure as saul but whatever he is doing he gives a great effort. If he is getting wasted he does that fullt. If he is walking that way fully then the other way fully a real character. Alot of the reviewers seem to be haters at someone who so easily has gotten so many females and famous. Its obvious there is jealousy. Also its good to point out 30 year getting wasted guys shouldnt be looked at as great authoritys on spirituality or anything else. Lastly is the subtlety of spirituality which can only be known diving very deep within oneself and earning grace to know something real. Maya is the India word who really knows behind the curtain ?certainly not the guy who did the movie. He didn't help his karma with the belittle movie..He felt insulted and made great effort for revenge on a guy he said please help me,1520899200,,2900,4.463276836158192
7795297,5,0988143801,"Yes, this is his first film. So, there are some minor issues with quality & framing. However, I'm giving it 5 stars because the message trumps all of that. This film maker really put his heart into the work and he told the story so brilliantly and honestly. This documentary basically turns the whole guru thing on it's head and forces us to look within to fix our own wounds. There are holly wood films with billion dollar budgets that don't come close to level of honesty and healing that work exudes. Definitely worth watching! I've watched it a few times myself!",1432857600,3,566,4.5588235294117645
7795298,5,0988143801,"It is extremely rare for someone to make a documentary like this about a spiritual teacher.  Spiritual documentaries usually fall into one of two camps: a. something bordering on hagiography--a saint's life, or b. an expose of the ""bad guru""--conman, sex addict, money grubber, and so on and so forth--you know the drill.  This is classic duality--it's either/or: light or dark, good or bad, true or fake--tiresome Western metaphysics, the human game of language which puts on/off switches--like a computers binary thoughts--on everything in the world, though the world is actually flows and ebbs, continuums and overlapping fields.  But this documentary explores both sides of the issue of the value of Bhagavan Das as a spiritual teacher.  It engages in an actual dialectic and leaves us in a third place that is beyond simple dualistic views of this ""guru,"" and which, not coincidentally, allows the filmmaker to actually get somewhere in his own spiritual growth rather than merely rehearsing the tiresome cliches of fanatic or disillusion ex-fanatic. Thank you, Jeff Brown, for a deep and thoughtful look at the guru phenomenon.  And to the guy who said the filmmaking sucks--I don't see that at all.  All those shots of the sun coming through the leaves were about trying to capture the nature spirituality of Bhagavan Das.  The trope is often used by professional filmmakers to convey similar ideas; I don't see any problems with Brown's use of it here.",1422316800,7,1460,5.083682008368201
7795299,3,0988143801,"I found this to be disturbing, quite honestly. I'm not sure how Bhagavan Das ever achieved recognition as a ""Guru"". He seems to be totally obsessed with sex and suffering from an unbalanced root chakra. Certainly not on the same level as Ram Dass.",1412726400,14,247,4.636363636363637
7795300,5,0988143801,"I loved this courageous, raw, brilliant movie. I have watched many spiritual documentaries but this one cut right to the heart of the matter in a way that felt so visceral and genuine. I love the way it went deep into the guru projections and looked at them from the inside out. And I loved all the humor that was threaded throughout, which softened some of the intensity. Anyone who is on a spiritual path should watch this movie. It is triggering and enlivening and asks the real questions we need to ask on the path. And the music was fantastic!",1411171200,8,548,4.435643564356436
7795301,1,0988143801,"Unbearable.  This video was made by a person who states at the beginning he never made a movie before - and it shows.  Lots of shots of tress with blinding sunlight and people driving in cars.  The documentary is about a shlubby guy who goes through a midlife crisis, decides to drop out of his law practice and go on a spiritual journey.  He discovers this guru and is bewitched.  I was horrified and embarrassed.  Yes, the guru makes nice music.  But get this - he is outspoken that his practice is to worship the vagina.  There is a cringe worthy moment where he is walking with his host to the airport and sees a pretty girl ahead and starts acting like a juvenile in heat - making cat calls and saying essentially how he'd like to f*ck her.  This is a 70 something year old man, mind you but would be inappropriate in any circumstance.  It soon became apparent to me that this guru is essentially a con man; one sees all the nubile women who for some reason find truth in him and the clear implication is that the worshipping process concerns him getting laid.  All of that would be fine except for the pretension that this ""guru"" has any insights.  His wisdom is loads of 1960s hippy talk devoid of insights or most importantly compassion.  Like so many of the 1960 hippies, it is all ultimately about ego.  As for the filmakker, he just seems a really confused person who projected onto this guru some fantasy without questioning in any substantive way what is going on.  A seriously disturbing documentary, but not for intended reasons.",1410652800,20,1544,4.503597122302159
