2295838,5,B0009JOJTA,"What can I say about this film that most of the other reviewers haven't already said. My wife and I first saw this film on the Catholic cable t.v. channel ETWN and needless to say, we both used up all the tissues in the box..LOL!

If you cannot feel the helplessness and sadness in the main character, you are not human. Barnabas has lost his wife, his best friend, his job and has no where to go for help until a good Samaritan takes him under his care. What happens soon after you have to see the film to believe. It IS a miracle!

I haven't been moved this much by a movie until I saw another recent film called Letters To God which my wife and I give a two box of tissues rating. LOL!

Again religion is not the dominant theme here - the film(s) I mentioned above, are for everyone. Enjoy! :)",1291334400,,796,4.122580645161291
2295839,5,B0009JOJTA,"I was given this DVD as gift to be watched especially Christmas Eve but anytime is great. The story depicts a man who feels his life is worthless, yet he offers the best, most appreciated gift to the Statue of Mother Mary. The response is exhilarating. This is an excellent movie for all ages and a wonderful Christmas tradition.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juggler-of-Notre-Dame/dp/B000BT02Z8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juggler of Notre Dame</a>",1264550400,2,487,6.507692307692308

It was the first movie that I saw that made me cry and it is one of the only movies that has touched me so deeply that I shed a tear or two. I think it is a timeless story of love and friendship and I plan to make a family tradition of watching it every Christmas.",1252281600,4,400,3.6627906976744184

2295844,4,B0009JOJTA,"Many years ago, my brothers and I were having Christmas at my parents house.  After dinner we decided to relax and put on the T.V.  There was this very sad movie that we watched.  We never saw it again.  We would talk about it each Christmas.  I have been trying to find it on either VHS or DVD for the past five years or so.  You cannot imagine my excitement when I actually found it!!!. I purchased a DVD for myself and one for my brother.  When I sat with my husband and daughters, I was a little disappointed in the movie at first. My kids made fun of it.  My husband and I, on the other hand, were so happy to re-live that Christmas past.  I truly do love this movie but warn that it is not a modern day classic.",1168819200,4,717,3.992957746478873
2295845,5,B0009JOJTA,"I saw this movie at about the same time that it was released.  I was maybe 10 years old.  I remember ""feeling"" for the main character, Barnaby.  I was moved by this movie, I cried for hours after watching it.  Growing up Catholic, this movie was also appealing because all of the characters appear to be Catholic that was the only world I knew at the time, I felt at home.  I just rented this movie and I have been debating on whether or not to purchase it for the last 2 years, but after seeing again 22 years later and having the same reaction as I did 22 years earlier.  I must own it.  I hope this little review helps people.  Maybe I'm weird, I can totally understand the pain that Barnaby feels.  This one is a good tear jerker.",1165536000,20,734,4.148936170212766
2295846,5,B0009JOJTA,"The Juggler of Notre Dame is one of the best, most inspirational Christmas movies I have ever seen.  It is such a simple movie, but one that has a strong message.  A wonderful family movie!!!  My all time favorite movie!!!!",1133049600,12,223,4.525

2295848,5,B0009JOJTA,"Although many people are calling this a ""movie"" I am almost certain it was a special show for either Wonderful World of Disney, or whatever show preceded that (Disneyland--? I can't quite remember) But it was a Disney special explaining its 45-50 minute run time. Now about the show--I love it.  It was a favorite of my Mother's, and watching it takes me back to many Christmases so many years ago. ***Spoiler Alert***  This is just to let you know that in reading the rest, you will find out most, but not all, of the story, from start to finish--venture forth at your own choice.  But you will get a good overview of the film.

It tells the tale of a loner man who juggles in the streets for a living, and who has this street guy (in the time they were called ""bums"" but he is quite likable and in more politically correct terms--is homeless--actually they both are.) who is positively awed by Barnaby's talent. He begins to tag along, unwanted at first, then eventually Barnaby relents and they become a team. The new friend eventually gets Barnaby to tell about why he gave up a professional career juggling and the audience sees these flashbacks that Barnaby has from time to time through the show of his newlywed bride who was a high-wire act, and who makes a misstep while he is in another area of the circus spinning plates and juggling. There is nothing graphic, inasmuch as you only see her lose her footing and begin to fall. The crashing of the abandoned plates and crystal bowls he was juggling an obvious metaphor for her broken body and his tragic loss. These two have a really nice friendship developing and on one particular day they come back with a nice sum of money. Other ""tramps""/homeless who are also living outside near the tracks observe this and steal the money, which Barnaby's friend tries to thwart--and in the process he is struck--only once, but apparently fatally. The next scene is of Barnaby looking over the makeshift grave of his friend, a pile of rocks and stones and a wooden cross.  He is crestfallen and all but ready to give up on life.  He tosses all of his Juggling paraphernalia into the river and simply begins to walk.

In his lonesome odyssey, he happens across the home of this man who sculpts (Merlin Olson), and he is intrigued by Barnaby, and wants to capture his likeness in a sculpture (clay). Barnaby is so despondent all the time that even Olson's sister, who is apparently the only one he lives with, observes that he just lives to eat and drink and nothing more. (You really get to dislike this woman, whose name is Dulcey, short for something like Dulcinea, I believe. She has absolutely no use for Barnaby and considers him a vagabond not worth her brother's time or talent. (She's also jealous that he never made a work of art out of her.) To make a long story short, they are all getting ready for a big Christmas Mass at a church that was damaged in an earthquake--and each parishioner is bringing a special gift of theirs for the infant Jesus to donate at Midnight Mass. Barnaby, of course, has nothing, and Dulcey goes out of her way to point that out.  The parish priest senses the depth of Barnaby's pain and shakes his head stating that he doesn't think he's ever met a man more lonesome or sad than Barnaby.  He does take the time to tell Barnaby about Olsen's tragedy (yes, he had one too and here is where a small flame is kindled inside Barnaby--you see he is so immersed in his own tragedies that he doesn't quite realize that others have had more than their share as well).  At this point you realize the moral of the story is not so much about Barnaby's tragedies--but how he has pulled within himself, while Olsen had taken a much more optimistic viewpoint and tried to do something better with his life--he begins to sculpt and mold. And there is something very peculiar about his gift to the church--a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, that bears a striking resemblance --to Barnaby's deceased wife.

Well, the big night arrives and everyone is going to Mass--but Barnaby decides to simply say farewell. Olsen's character is quite upset about it; as he's not quite finished the bust he is doing (and it looks quite good!) although really it's because he senses Barnaby's hurt.  The entire mood of the film changes as strains of the adaptation of ""Greensleeves"" is played to the tune of ""What Child is This""--everyone bringing their gifts before the Holy Infant in the manger and before the statue of the Blessed Mother. As the people drift away, and silence begins to pervade the scene, Barnaby strolls in to have one more look at that statue that so resembles his beloved Beatrice. A sound! He looks to his side and there is his homeless friend smiling at him--and he has been granted ""special graces"" to see Barnaby and tell him that he hasn't been unloved at all--and that he does have a *very* special gift he can give the Madonna-- he can juggle!  And what do you suppose is among all those things piled around the statue? Why there's Barnaby's bag of juggling gear.  After a very heartwarming talk with the spirit of his friend--Barnaby gives the only gift he can give--and he thinks it is going unnoticed--it isn't!  And the reward he gets for his efforts is what really makes the movie a worthwhile watch.

Yes, it's a tear-jerker; but unlike others, I think it has a ""happy"" ending--as a man who has fallen about as deep into despondency as one can get, realizes that life must go on, and it's how we handle our tragedies that either makes us survivors, or chronically depressed.  It is a great ""moral play"" as another reviewer points out--but it is also just a great and ""make you feel good all over"" film.  I already had it on VHS, but couldn't wait to find it on DVD--I got this one and have never regretted it. ***I WILL add that the film has STRONG ""Religious"" overtones, so the folks who do not wish to see/hear films that stress the Faith in God, or who become cynical and even sarcastic when there is a clear reference to God and/or miracles... that person will NOT like this film.  It is for those of us who have a Faith in God, and are proud to proclaim it--other than that, to each his/her own.",1416096000,4,6192,4.527305282005371
2295849,5,B0009JOJTA,I never cried so much--- at a Christmas miracle. I had seen it in the lat 80s and bawled out of sadnee but that was turned by the Christmas miracle given to a man who had lost all. A lovely story and everyone should see it. I don't know why they don't put this on every year...same with Emmett Otter's jug band Christmas (mumppet characters). They ne er put on the best.,1410825600,,370,4.152777777777778

2295851,5,B0009JOJTA,"I have watched this little-known Christmas tale every year since it was aired on local TV.  Then obtained BUS tape for several years.

Try it...it will become a new Christmas tradition for you as well.",1392768000,,363,4.698412698412699

2295853,5,B0009JOJTA,"I bought this for my mom for christmas. This was a made-for-television movie that she absolutely loved, and I looked for it on ""video"" for years and years with no luck. This past christmas, it popped in my head again and I thought I'd try here on Amazon. Not only did they have it, it was cheap! It was my slam-dunk gift this year.

I personally haven't seen this since it originally aired god-knows-when, but my mom has already watched it several times, and she's thrilled with it.",1390780800,,482,4.4772727272727275

2295855,3,B0009JOJTA,"Although very well-acted and presented, there are embellishments here to the original legend, and this is too sad for me.  Don't watch this one if you are lonely or sad at Christmastime. I still remember seeing the short ""made-for TV"" version with Kirk Douglas (from the 1950's?) late one night as a child - I would love to get a copy of THAT one if I could find it. It is a lovely story.",1389484800,,388,4.243243243243243

2295859,5,B0009JOJTA,One of the most moving stories I have ever seen. This story exemplifies that God loves us for who we are...not what we do. It is a family tradition to watch every year. Watch with an open heart and you will absolutely be moved.,1380153600,,227,4.181818181818182

2295862,5,B0009JOJTA,"One of the best kept secrets for Christmas.  This made-for-TV movie first appeared in the mid-Eighties as an ""After School Special"" TV show.  Starring Merlin Olsen, Melinda Dillon, and an unknown actor named Carl Carllson, who by the way is the whole movie, is just sad, sweet, and heart-warming.

2295864,1,B0009JOJTA,"This is a vey disappointing version of a classic story. Instead of emphasizing the spiritual beauty of the film, it meanders around a secular landscape that winds up meaning very litte. Maybe I was expecting too much, still remembering the wonderful Kirk Douglas black and white version from the fifties. Oh well, time and film marches on in its relentless pursuit of mediocrity. C'est la vie/",1346544000,,393,4.96969696969697
2295865,5,B0009JOJTA,"I first saw this movie twenty or more years ago. I tried to find it for a long time, and was very pleased to find it here. You don't usually see a Christmas movie that's not a rehash of A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life. Be warned, this movie doesn't dodge the reality of what Christmas is about. If you're someone who feels obligated to say happy holidays instead of merry Christmas for fear of hurting somebody's feelings,this probably isn't for you. It's one of my favorites.",1309737600,2,487,4.48314606741573
2295866,5,B0009JOJTA,"This tale combines the triumph of hope with a touch of religious belief. While the story takes place at Christmas time, it is appropriate for viewing throughout the year. Variations of this story can be traced back for centuries in old morality plays. A main theme is that kindness makes a difference, and that every gift, no matter how small, is great in the eyes of Heaven.

Although it is clean and wholesome, caution is urged. There are numerous flashbacks to a fatal accident. There is no blood, but there is graphic suggestion of destruction. Likewise, a scene depicting an attack shows the skirmish, but no blood. Additionally, a scene in which a statue comes to life may disturb some viewers.

This is one of those movies that can be watched over and over, with a new and subtle message to be gained each time.",1298764800,6,818,4.63448275862069
