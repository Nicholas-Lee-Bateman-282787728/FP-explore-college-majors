3589569,3,B001FXG2DK,The one customer review was a cut and paste from the description on the back of the box. This leads me to believe that the person who left it was involved with the film which I find to be a bit disingenuous,1226707200,13,206,3.9285714285714284

3589576,2,B001FXG2DK,I can't say I would recommend someone purchasing this movie. It's okay for a rental. Free stream it like I did. There is nothing interesting to say about it. It is a low budget movie. The acting is generic.,1455580800,,206,4.3076923076923075

3589595,3,B001FXG2DK,"Well, I am betwixt and between liking and disliking this film.! It's never clear to me if Tim really loves Joe as much as he claims--I feel its mostly a fling with possibilities! Also, I am not sure just what happened to Joe (did he accidentally kill himself, was he waylaid by someone and killed or was he doing a 'trick' and killed by the 'trick?' His 'recovery' from Joe's death seems quick for he quickly  tries to make it with (can't recall his name)the other guy, but is rebuffed by same because of the Test issue! For me there is no resolution in Tim's life so I was left in the4 dark as to his future. Acting was above par and thought Joe was hot and would like to see him  in another gay friendly film..",1438646400,2,712,4.189781021897811
3589596,1,B001FXG2DK,"After first 30 minutes I started to watch this movie with my finger on ""scan"" button. THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING INTERESTING IN IT ;(
The plot is sooooo sensless that I don't even feel like briefing it in one sentence.
Another example of very bad gay theme movie.
CRAP!",1295222400,,269,4.510204081632653
3589597,5,B001FXG2DK,"This is a far more polished film than Bulldog in the Whitehouse; it made me happy to discover that all of Verow's films do not look like that one. Except for a few grainy night scenes, you'd never know that this was shot on HD video - Verow's preferred medium. Between Something & Nothing is an unusual film; a weird cross between The Paper Chase and Midnight Cowboy. I liked the art class scenes (though I never had a male model that built when I took figure drawing class back in 1977; if I had I might have figured out that I was gay a year earlier) and I liked Joe's walks on the wide side too. The two opposing storylines are actually quite complimentary. There are some very sexy love scenes too and Tim Swain is major league cute, and then hot with a mohawk, as Joe. With the exception of some bad, or inappropriate music during a couple of climactic scenes, I can't find much fault with this film.

The acting throughout is also superb.

Is it for everyone? Maybe not but it sure beats some of the Brat Pack films from the '80s that tried to mine similar territory. I don't know how much of Between Something & Nothing is autobiographical and how much is fiction - or simply embellished - but it feels authentic and a lot of it got under my skin.

3589598,3,B001FXG2DK,"On the whole, I liked this quirky flick.  It had some of the elements of a film school senior thesis/1990s indie production.  Filmed as it was in Providence, RI, home to the Rhode Island School of Design, it could easily have been the former.  In any event, this is a challenging film, and whether it's worth the viewer's time is more subjective than usual.  If you prefer your films to have clear character motivation provided at some point as well as some kind of a visible conclusion, you probably aren't going to love this story.  On the other hand, director Todd Verow's look at the seamier side of student and urban life, is often colorful and interesting.

There were plenty of moments here when all of the otherwise very attractive principal characters seemed hellbent on some form of self-destruction despite their obvious intelligence, looks and talents.  No plausible reasons for the behavior are provided by filmmaker, which leaves a sizable hole in the story.  On the other hand, much of the excessive drinking, petty larceny, and coke sniffing on view here is probably not so far from actually happens when young adults are on their own for the first time in their lives.  (RISD would  probably not be fond of this reasoning and doubtless would prefer that the student characters not be poster kids for their school.)

On the positive side, there is some very interesting chemistry between the two lead male characters in the film--Joe and Ramon.  The first, a gay boy-next-door type and aspiring artist and the second a handsome and fairly articulate street hustler.  The attraction between these two attractive young men is totally understandable, but their growing relationship is far more complicated.  Likewise, the bond between Joe and his student pal, Jennifer--both of them outsiders at the school--has its logic and is touching at times.

I wished that there had been more resolution to this story, but there are some good moments to be mined here by the patient viewer.  A three-plus for an attractive cast and for a long look at Providence.",1238112000,9,2065,4.9077809798270895
3589599,1,B001FXG2DK,"Okay, I'm a little confused here, because this movie appears to have been filmed on a cell phone, but I think this pretty much is the plot.  We're in some dark post World War III future, when the world is divided into two clans.  First, there's the Clan of Old People, who are all stupid and extremely ugly and have to pay to have sex.  This sex part naturally involves EVERYBODY ELSE, namely the Clan of Young and Good Looking People.  And they steal a lot, and have sex a lot, and inexplicably die or commit suicide or vanish forever after one brief scene in the film.  Oh, and drink coffee.  (Gallons and gallons of coffee went into the making of this feature.)  This second clan is headed by a REALLY HOT GUY, who spends all his time wandering around empty city streets or abandoned buildings or construction dump sites or windowless basements.  (Come to think of it, I don't remember ANY rooms having a window.)  Anyway, eventually what he does is make a religious icon out of a broken mirror and paper and his own blood.  (Seriously!)  Apparently it wins him some contest, the prize being (I assume) a cell phone of his own so he can churn out even more films.  Please understand that I honestly DID try to verify my facts here by clicking on the EXTRAS button, which then called up DELETED SCENES AND UNUSED FOOTAGE.  I watched just long enough to verify that these are, in fact, ACTUALLY WORSE than the movie itself.  And since I'd already wasted almost two hours of my life on the previous crap, I figured that was punishment enough.  Your move.",1236902400,14,1554,4.480427046263345

8303026,4,B001FXG2DK,"This movie is odd and unpredictable. Maybe that is why I liked it more than most who reviewed this. While some scenes may not make much sense to many, real life is often that way, don't always make sense.

8303032,1,B001FXG2DK,"I have seen better films from undergraduate film makers, and watching this film felt even more amateurish.  The actors delivery of most of the dialogue has the emotional depth and authenticity of an elementary school play.  Among the bad films that I have seen in my lifetime, this one rates right at the bottom.  This film was not able to overcome its low budget and even make the bar scenes appear realistic.  Luckily, I stopped watching one hour into the film and saved the next 45 minutes for something more worthwhile.",1471564800,,523,4.714285714285714

8303034,1,B001FXG2DK,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever watched to the end. The sound is terrible, the music inappropriate, the acting stiff and the story time-line gets mauled. The RISD students are among the best in the art world, and this movie implies that they are all a bit off the wall or completely crazy. As for the street game in Providence, it is not all sordid as portrayed in the film. Not every hustler goes with just anyone, and a freshman from Bangor, ME would not fall quite so fast into street trade.  The movie is just not realistic on any level.
As to why I watched the movie until the end... I kept thinking something realistic would happen. I kept waiting for something familiar to ring true. I kept hoping the acting would improve. The only thing that improved was the change from the terrible sounding and inappropriate sound of the bongo playing to an obnoxious woodwind.",1464998400,2,883,4.484472049689441
