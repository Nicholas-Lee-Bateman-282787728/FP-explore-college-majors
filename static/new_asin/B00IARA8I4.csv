8640482,3,B00IARA8I4,"Weird Italian film with Bud Cort dubbed in Italian. Never heard of this film but I am a fan of the ""Raro"" releases. Since I got it so cheap it was worth the view. Can't recommended it to anyone one but hard core Italian 70s films. Not a ""Gallio"" not a ""poliziotteschi"" just a trippin' drug abuse film.",1419897600,5,301,4.206896551724138
8640483,3,B00IARA8I4,"Prior to purchasing this DVD, I have 2 other versions of this film--one was a VHS tape I received all in Italian, the second was from an eBay auction that was a of DVD with English subtitles.  I received the DVD in a very timely manner AND when I put it in my DVD player, I was very happy to see the excellent quality of the film-to-DVD transfer and that the film not only had English subtitles, but was dubbed in English as well.  However, I noted that a scene had been shortened from the original film, which was okay, but I was disappointed that the film had glitches where it froze throughout the last half of the film and the bonus features were not accessible.  I ended up sending the DVD back to Amazon as being defective and requested another DVD.  Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the replacement DVD and was about to send it back for a refund when, fortunately, my computer savvy son told me to play the DVD in my computer as some transfers don't play well in DVD players.  When I did, I was VERY happy that the film played well throughout with no glitches AND I was able to view the bonus features!

I would have given a much higher rating, were it not for the problem I had in watching it in my DVD player.  In future, I would suggest that buyers be told that before they return a DVD, to make sure that they try to watch it in their computers if it doesn't play well in their DVD players to see if it works better there.",1409875200,8,1443,4.187725631768953
