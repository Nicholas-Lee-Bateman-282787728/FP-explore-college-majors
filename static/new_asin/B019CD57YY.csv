8744680,5,B019CD57YY,"I don't know how I originally ended up watching this show, but it convinced me to buy the Blu-ray so I could watch it over and over. Foreign television makes me weep for TV here in the United States. I cannot wait for season 2! Just be advised - this Blu-ray will not play in US region Blu-ray players. You will need the proper region player or else rip it (check out MakeMKV) to a digital format so you can play it with something like Plex.",1494028800,4,441,4.1395348837209305
