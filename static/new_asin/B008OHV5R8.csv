5172981,4,B008OHV5R8,"Safety Not Guaranteed:  Seemingly everywhere these days, Mark Duplass stars this time in this offbeat but charming comedy.  Based on a whimsical ad placed in a newspaper, the film focuses on Kenneth (Duplass) who is looking for a companion to go back in time in his homemade time machine.

A magazine writer (Jake M. Johnson) bored and lacking a story, volunteers to head to a resort town in Washington to investigate.  He takes along two interns he calls the lesbian and the Indian.  He's speaking of Darius (Aubrey Plaza from TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") and Amau (Karan Soni).  Both are moderately quirky but adorable.  What Jeff (Johnson) is really wanting to do is look up an old high school flame (Jenica Bergere) and relive his sexual escapades.

When Jeff fails to get Kenneth to take him along on his wayback machine, Darius steps up to the plate.  Kenneth and Darius click and they are off and running gathering supplies and equipment.  Darius realizes that Kenneth is serious when they break into a manufacturing plant of high powered lasers.  Directed by Colin Trevorrow from a screenplay by Derek Connolly, the movie is a bit out there but is grounded by some nice performances by Duplass and Plaza.  The characters are given plenty of room to breathe and the humor ranges from subtle to hilarious one-liners.  Even with a fantasy-like conclusion, I enjoyed the movie throughout.",1343520000,,1392,4.897435897435898
5172982,4,B008OHV5R8,"This goofy little film starts at a (fictitious) magazine headquarters in Seattle. A writer is asked to investigate a classified ad which reads: ""WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED.""

He commandeers two interns to assist him and heads off to a small beach community on the Pacific Coast. In no time, he finds a ""lost love"" (the real reason he wanted to go!) and assigns the interns the task of looking into the local kook who placed the ad.

In this 2012 Seattle International Film Festival selection, we see:
  * Jake Johnson (""No Strings Attached"") as the magazine writer. This character is singularly unpleasant: rude, self-serving, hedonistic and given to mind-altering chemicals.
  * Aubrey Plaza (""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"") is one of the interns. She is highly skeptical of this whole time-travel scheme, but wants the story so she can keep her job.
  * Karan Soni (Lots of TV) is the poor intern who gets stuck with the writer. His main flaw, according to the writer, is that he is a virgin.
  * Jenica Bergere (""Rat Race"") is the writer's lost love. I was so glad to see that she has some common sense!
  * Mark Duplass (""Darling Companion"") is the time-travel kook. By the time he is teaching our gal martial arts and small-arms skills, we ALL felt skeptical!
  * Kristen Bell (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") probably only appeared in this cameo so the film makers could get financing.

BTW, the ubiquitous Duplass brothers have been all over Hollywood for over a decade. They act, direct, write and produce...pretty successfully, too. I'll bet their mother is proud! I wonder if she'll get her copy of the DVD from Amazon.",1342396800,4,1782,4.703225806451613
5172983,4,B008OHV5R8,"The last we heard of the Duplass Brothers (Jay and Mark), they brought us ""Jeff, WHo Lives at Home"". Now comes this, which is co-produced by the Duplass brothers and others, and which stars Mark Duplass.

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (86 min.) is based on a real ad which appeared in a magazine, looking for a time travel mate, ""please bring your own weapons, safety not guaranteed"". From that writer Derek Connolly made up this story. In its very essence, a journalist and 2 interns from Seattle Magazine go out to Ocean View, WA, to find out who placed the ad (which turns out to be Kenneth, played by Mark Duplass), and why. One of the interns, Darius (played by Aubrey Plaza) poses as the time traveler-wanna be. Apart from this main story line, there are several parallel lines, one involving the magazine reporter looking up a HS girlfriend, now 20 years later. Duplass plays Kenneth straight up and you cannot tell whether the guy really believes that he can time travel, or whether he's just putting us on. That is one of the movie's biggest strenghts as it keeps the interest in the plot. That said, I was a bit let down by the ending, which came with a number of things unexplained, or worse, simply not believable.

This is a quirky little movie that is mostly entertaining. The acting performances are great, in particular from Mark Duplass and Aubrey Plaza. Kudos also for the excellent soundtrack from Ryan Miller. Make sure to stick around to the very end, as ""Big Machine"", a song that Duplass briefly plays solo in the movie, plays in full band mode as the end credits roll, and it's a fantastic tune (performed by/credited to Ryan Miller and Mark Duplass). This movie is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are in the mood for a good indie movie, I'd readily recommend ""Safety Not Guaranteed"".",1341100800,13,1827,4.6532507739938085
5172984,4,B008OHV5R8,"Journalists at a small Seattle magazine pursue a man who placed an unusual ad seeking a partner for time travel. They are determined to see if he is crazy, or what other motives he may have. Aubrey Plaza is excellent here as an intern who seeks to connect with the man in order to find out what he is up to. The three young journalists are interesting characters and all bring unique personality traits to the film, and the man they are pursuing will keep you guessing if he is overly paranoid or has made an amazing discovery. This is very well-done film, and has likeable characters that all fit quite well into the storyline.",1340841600,3,628,4.469565217391304
5172985,5,B008OHV5R8,"I wasn't sure what to expect going in. I was intrigued by the trailer and the excellent reviews, and I love Audrey Plaza's April on Parks and Rec and Jake Johnson's Nick on the New Girl, but time travel? Not necessarily my thing. But I absolutely loved it. There was something just so moving and bittersweet about Darius and Kenneth's journey, and while I wasn't in love with the other characters (Jeff and Arnou), they provided some amusing comedy to balance everything out.

It's hard for me to know who will and won't enjoy this movie because it is quirky and a little different, like most indie movies. But I loved it. I saw it twice in theaters, and can't wait to get the DVD.",1340582400,10,681,4.448
5172986,5,B008OHV5R8,"""The mission is to do with regret and mistakes. The mission is also about love.""

this movie struck a long and very deep note.  we are all unfortunately time travelers, but the opportunity to go back and repair is of course a bit cliched.  what really beckons is going back to renew and re-create.

the film ends, more or less, with her saying ""i do"".  those are always good words from a woman you love, and usually lead to great and unexpected things.

for me, this film was a great and unexpected thing.  if you haven't, you should go see it too.",1340409600,2,548,4.313725490196078
5172987,4,B008OHV5R8,"I saw the trailer for this movie while at the theater for another movie.  Given that the majority of movies are worse than their trailers, I didn't think this one would be very good and was planning on skipping it.  The premise was intriguing, though.  When I saw that the NY Times had given it a star as being a notable film, I decided to give it a try.  It turned out to be much better than I expected.  There is some very funny snappy dialogue, especially in the first half.  Then there is the underlying suspense of whether the central character will turn out to be for real, or a possibly-dangerous mental case.  But in addition, there are half a dozen characters who are more than cardboard cut-outs.  The movie is really about how everyone has mistakes in their past that they regret and wish they could live over again.  I thought the ending was a bit rushed and there were a few dangling threads, but overall it is a very nice little movie.",1340323200,2,949,4.377142857142857
5172988,4,B008OHV5R8,"Darius, a young magazine intern (played by Audrey Plaza), is recruited to help a staff writer with a story about a bizarre young man who has advertised for a time-travel partner, specifying that ""safety is not guaranteed"". When she finds him, she goes undercover to get the story. As she gets to know Kenneth (played by Mark Duplass), his story gets more and more interesting. He really believes he'll be able to go back in time. Soon, she's attracted to the lonely young man and feels guilty about deceiving him.

I love indies. This one is funny, sweet, and unpretentious with quirky but genuine characters. Besides Darius and Kenneth, there is a second intern, Arnau, and the staff writer, Jeff. While Darius gets the story, Jeff and Arnau are pursuing everything but the story.",1339804800,,781,4.8283582089552235
5172989,4,B008OHV5R8,"There are times that even as a film critic with the endless amount of films that you see, hear about, and look into by word of mouth; some are bound to fly under the radar. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" was one of those films. The little independent comedy had quite the reputation after being shown at SXSW a few months ago, so it was obviously a film that was worth looking out for. But you get caught up in the mainstream releases, especially this time of year. ""Prometheus,"" ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" ""Brave,"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" all within seven weeks of each other among many others in between. This is definitely a year where smaller releases can slip through the cracks incredibly easily, but make it a point not to miss such a great little gem like ""Safety Not Guaranteed.""

Darius (Aubrey Plaza, ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"") is slightly cynical and pessimistic, but also incredibly realistic. She's trying to turn her life around by finding a new job to make it on her own. So far she's coming up short. Interning for a magazine company isn't exactly working out for her until the day Kenneth's (Mark Duplass) peculiar wanted ad is brought up by one of the writers named Jeff (Jake M. Johnson) in a meeting as an idea for an article. Oddly enough, Kenneth is looking for someone to accompany him as he travels through time. As Jeff, Darius, and Arnau (Karan Soni), the other intern assigned to the project, prepare to write an article on a delusional madman, they fail to foresee that this assignment will change each one of them by the time it's all over.

The film feels very indie as soon as it begins. The soundtrack is written and performed by Ryan Miller, but has this Arcade Fire type of feel to it. What actually came to mind was ""Wake Up"" from the ""Where the Wild Things Are"" soundtrack. It's mostly just this really solid indie rock that puts you in a better mood just listening to it. The humor is very dry, but also very smart and usually capitalizes on awkward situations; think ""Little Miss Sunshine."" There are some really memorable and funny one-liners in the film, as well. ""You're dangling my vagina out there like bait,"" is a personal favorite, but, ""There's no sense in nonsense, especially when the heat is hot,"" packs more of a punch.

Beneath the thick layer of comedy is a lot of really personal stuff for every main character. What's fantastic about ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is that not only does it touch base on what makes these characters flawed, what drives them, or what the reason for their quirks is, but the film also gives each of their story arcs the appropriate amount of time. It does seem like there could have been a bit more to both Jeff's and Arnau's side stories, but overall it's very fulfilling.

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is charming, laugh-out-loud funny, and unpredictable; basically all the things a unique indie comedy like this should be. Kenneth has this ""Napoleon Dynamite"" quality to him with all of his ""martial arts training"" and rolling around and the film features one of the funniest car chases of recent memory. It also has this ""Sound of My Voice"" kind of quality to it in the sense that you're left wondering if Kenneth can really travel to the future or not much in the same vein of questioning whether Maggie was from the future in ""Sound of My Voice."" ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is just fantastically enjoyable from all sides.",1339804800,3,3457,4.680921052631579

5173044,5,B008OHV5R8,"This is a charming, low budget comedy.  The script is spot on in capturing the three needy individuals sent by a trendy magazine to investigate a very peculiar ad in the personals column.  The story is captivating, the characters are fun, and the viewer really appreciates the fact that the movie never descends into creepy territory.  In fact, there is a rather sweet turn of events when the thirty-something reportersent on this quest with two weird interns uses the road trip to rekindle a torrid teenage fling.

The movie is dominated, though, by Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) who is absolutely perfect in the role of the angst filled, brooding, millennial oddball caught in an adult world for which she in no way prepared. (Basically the same character she played on Parks and Rec., but she does it sooooo well.) she is engaging and really funny in a role tailor made for her.

This is one of those really good, under appreciated gems one stumbles across on Netflix and then rewatches several times over the next week. I put this in the same basket with That Thing You Do. They are in no way similar, but they are both pleasant, engrossing films that are easy, low stress views.",1516233600,,1189,4.697115384615385

It claims to involve time travel, but you will find that it doesn't really involve time travel in the traditional, science fiction sense.  I believe that most people who see this movie don't get the real message.  Spoiler alert -- I'm going to spell it out for you, here and now.  As I already said, the film is a light romantic comedy, that is, until the last scene.  In that moment, the true meaning comes through.  And that meaning is this.  We are all time travelers.

I love seeing the locations around Long Beach (they call it Longview in the film) Washington where I spent many teen summers. Beyond the scenery (for me) I loved every one of these characters - they are not the cool people, but the flawed real people.

The idea of recapturing the past is a huge theme here - and who doesn't want to go back to their youth ... first love's, etc. You will care deeply about every one of the characters here - the awful boss that turns out to be a nice guy, the crazy guy building a time machine that turns out to be not so crazy. I'm not sure why Kristen Bell gets a top billing though - she is a minor role, and the lead actress (Lauren Carlos as Darius) knocks it out of the park as the quintessential Seattle chick - seeming disinterested in others, but is really heart-broken, and incredibly kind - not sure why we don't see her in more movies.

This film is an adventure with a lot of unexpected turns - in plot, and the many facets of each character. I have recommended this movie to anyone that will listen to me, and they have all loved it.",1501632000,,1297,4.138888888888889

The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Related equally to the male and female leads (big fan of Mark Duplass as a writer and director, too).  Great movie about staying true to yourself and your ideals regardless of what others think.  Only wish more movies were like that.  Anyway, so if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)",1494374400,2,1318,4.637931034482759
5173100,5,B008OHV5R8,"I just saw this movie a few days ago and while I had heard of it before I never knew what the plot was nor who was in it or anything.  The trailers didn't seem to say a whole lot about this movie so I honestly had no concept about what to expect from it. But, upon viewing this movie I was pleasantly surprised.

I must admit that what furthered my motivation besides the fact that I had no idea what this movie was about is Aubrey Plaza being in it.  She is a good actress in my opinion, plus she is drop dead gorgeous and incredibly smokin' hot.

Out of the cast, Aubrey is the only star in this that I am familiar with I admit.  Regardless of that I found the most of the performances to be remarkable and flawless.  Also, the characters were very relatable and believable as well.  The only performances in this movie that I found to be weak were the two actors playing the FBI agents.  Their acting was considerably sub-par and their characters acted way too mellow for Feds looking to bust someone.

I found Darius(Aubrey Plaza) to be an easy character to relate to as she is a wallflower feeling highly cynical and unlucky in love and life.  She also hates her intern job at a Seattle-based magazine.  From that you get to know that Darius isn't a bad person she just never got a break in her life so she feels cheated by life and has stopped caring.  Her boss Jeff(Jake Johnson) is a self-indulgent, fun-loving, alcoholic who's kind of a jerk, but when all is said and done he does care about other people's happiness even if he can't find himself any.  Her co-worker Arnau(Karan Soni) is a responsible, young twenty something, who works hard but doesn't make time for anything fun to do.  Finally, there's this strange guy named Kenneth(Mark Duplass) of whom is a grocery store worker that has left an odd message in the personals regarding a time machine mission.

Overall, what this movie offers is fun scenes of partying, relatable and interesting characters, mostly believable performances, a different approach from the usual movies, a mystery about one of the characters that keeps you guessing where the plot and situations will go to, romance, and besides an interesting plot and characters a positive measure as to how sometimes there are people and situations out there that are way bigger than us.

The cast is perfect, the story is charming, and the premise, about a newspaper classified seeking assistance with time travel, is true, though the story that follows is fiction. Director Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World, Star Wars Episode IX) carefully builds suspense in this character-driven story so that the audience cannot be certain whether or not time travel is possible until the end (I won't reveal either way). Aubrey Plaza leads the story as Darius and most of the story focuses on her getting to know Kenneth (played by Mark Duplass, from the League). A side story involves her co-worker Jeff (played by Jake Johnson, from New Girl and Jurassic World) trying to reconnect with an old girlfriend and help intern Arnau (Karan Soni, of Deadpool and Ghostbusters fame) break out of his shell.

5173139,1,B008OHV5R8,"""Safety"" was the winner of the Sundance Festival's screenwriters award but i don't know why. The movie's production values were adequet but missed in conveying atmosphere. Character development and dialog could have overcome this but this did not happen. Acting and dialog had no depth. The recurring theme seems to have been a confused imbalance between comedy as pathos and pathos as comedy. All of which was compounded by predictability except for the injection of "" I only have one ear "" which fit about as well as Hamlet proclaiming ""Yorick was not fulfilled by his career in ballet"". If your audience is cinematic Mensa wannabes, at least,  give them something worthy of thought. It didn't.

5173155,5,B008OHV5R8,"My heart is still beating like crazy when I think about the ending. I just couldn't stop playing this bluray last night while the ending credit was rolling.
YES, SAFETY WAS NOT QUARANTEED and you need some kind of pills to come yourself down to prepare for the sumptuous ending.

There are a lot of timemachine movies out there and honestly hundreds of them are more dazzling Sci-Fi effects and billions of budgets and star power involved, they could be more enjoyable, but if you watch this movie with a huge doubt the fact that there is not a single well known actor or this is not a huge budget film or even this was not a big boxoffice hit back then.
But oh man if you just go to the end of this movie, you will never in your life forget this movie till you die. I was almost jump to the ceiling of my house and made a hole with my fist punching it with joy and stimulation.

Instead of telling you the details of the story, let me tell you how many timemachine movies out there first.

Of course first in line is

1. Back to the Future 1-3. I still remember seeing the part one from the television at night on the holiday some holiday and I couldn't sleep that night. I just couldn't. How could Robert make a movie like that made me so excite? He was playing with the tool so well that I was his pray the whole time.
I will never forget Michael J. Fox and of course the most quircky doctor Dr. Emmett Brown the Christopher Lloyd. I even searched his name to see his other movies like Roger Rabbit.

2. Terminator 1- beyond. We all know this series. Although only part 1 and 2 were that good. We still think that the cyborgs are truely scary and the love stroy between Michael Biehn and Linda Halmilton is another side story which is another gift. And without Arnold this movie is nothing.

3. The Time Traveller's Wife. Yes I know this movie is not that superior comparing to the fact that is was based on the best seller and the director is Robert Schwentke who started artistic films like TATTOO! , Eierdiebe. We expected something more. But then again I thought that this was the most romantic timemachine movie ever. Becaue there was the most beautiful actress Rachel McAdams and another soft and tender guy Eric Bana every artistic director wants <Think about HANNAH-Joe Wright>.

4. The Time Machine (2002) Simon Wells is the director who made mostly animations like AN AMERICAN TALE, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, MARS NEEDS MOM TOO. This movie is based on H.G. Wells' novel and they made it pretty impressively original and pretty scary way.

5. Donnie Darko. This is an instant cult film. Some say the story is kind of unkind but I wouldn't say it's something like surrealistic or experimental film like unkind. It's just strange. But most of those who sees movie like more then 10 a month will die to own this on dvd. Rabbit man with one eye appears and keep telling the troubled teen what to do. Following that bunny guy he is more in trouble. So what's it got to do with the timemachine?
Because we all know that the plane part was crashed inside the house of the antagonist and probably he is dead already.

6. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban We all know this movie. It's just great. Alfonso Cuarn is the director from Mexico that can be trusted from his movies like GRAVITY, CHILDREN OF MEN, and provocative Y tu mam tambin and cute A Little Princess. This was not the best hit film of the series but if you see the movie you will see that it's a precious piece because it has time travel and all.

7. Time Bandits THE Terry Gilliam is the name you should remember. The great maestro director who has no luck so far who created films like BRAZIL, 12 Monkeys, THE FISHER KING, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus , Monty Python and the Holy Grail , The Adventures of Baron Munchausen and recently The Zero Theorem. This is more for kids but if you see the dark scene with the bunch of cube like figure hang on the rope that was kind of artisic to look at. It was 4 dimentional and quite original too look at. His way of framing is always indeed original.
Look at BRAZIL his legendary film when the angel, the antagonist's dream woman is flying and lots and lots of dream city is crashing down scene. It was just work of art and at the same time great mis-en-scene.

8. Napoleon Dynamite. A most quircky timemachine film of alll time. The director is well known for one more film Nacho Libre a comedy. Now you have more idea. This is a teen flick and is so quircky that it's not for everyone. But some calls it a cult film.

9. Primer You know the budget of this film and you will freak out. $7,000 (estimated) is the word. Really? Yes. I mean really? YES!! But it's a Sci-Fi film. YES! But it has science fiction touch? YES!  Is it wacthable? YES the hell yes!!!
He made another great film called Upstream Color (2013) this time the budget was $50,000 (estimated) Are you for real?

10. Bill and Tedd's Excellent Adventure  another teen 80's flick. You will enjoy or else you are not human although it's quircky and two of the main actors are childish.

11. Hot Tub Time Machine comic and pretty original. I have no idea why the budget of this film was  $36,000,000 (estimated) though. The  $36,000,000 (estimated) final gross was. It's fun to watch. It will shine your evening for sure. No more comment about it.

BUT you know what?
All of these lists cannot beat the one movie which is SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED.
Because the safety is not guaranteed because of the ending.",1475798400,,5488,4.389162561576355

I only rented it because the original ad that they show was a real advertisement placed in ""Backwoods Home"" magazine by one of its writers (of course, the intent of the original ad was to find a life partner willing to live by the old ways.) I got immediately into the story and the hour and a half sadly went by in no time flat. I found it so good I purchased a DVD copy. One note - there is a serious side to this and a comical side to it. I found the characters related well to my own family, and the implausible story line combined with the reality of what would happen if someone figured out how to time travel, a very interesting combination. Well acted too, or I would not have given it 5 stars. Mind you, you need to like films like ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" and ""Time Rider"" to appreciate this one.",1459209600,3,834,4.21875

When the intrepid journalists head out to find the real scoop on this guy and one of the reporters has an ulterior motive too, he wants to hook up with an old girlfriend, you will run into all manner of crazy or is it crazy?

Aubrey Plaza is attractive and well cast as the ""goth-girl"" turned undercover journalist-intern who befriends the author of a classified ad-based invitation to travel in time. Her transition from initial skepticism to growing fondness and eventual acceptance of the genuine intent of the would-be time traveller is compelling stuff. The revelation of the complex nature and past history of the time traveller is slowly unreeled as the story progresses, making you want to root for the success of his seemingly ill-conceived project. Mark Duplass turns in a very credible and heartfelt performance as the time traveller.

5173462,5,B008OHV5R8,"I like to watch a variety of movies, some of which are things that I have never heard of before.  Usually there's a reason I've never heard of them.  However, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is one of those rare gems that you really hope to find when you are looking through more-obscure movies.

You know the setup from the main review above: reporters track down a man who placed an ad for helpers on a mission back in time, ""safety not guaranteed.""  Much of the movie is spent with them figuring out whether he's actually a time traveler or just crazy.  Refreshingly, the movie answers this question.  What's also refreshing is that this is an ""actors' showcase"" of a movie that isn't dull, tedious and boring.  Mark Duplass and Aubrey Plaza play unique characters who are not overly precious or dramatic; they are who they are.  By the time the movie ends, whether or not Duplass' character is a nutjob, you're rooting for that odd duck.

I don't want to give too much away, and really I don't have to.  This is a short, well-written, well-acted, well-directed, and well-edited film.  I wish more movies were like that.  Highly recommended; it even makes a nice gift for a friend.",1438041600,,1176,4.628019323671498

That said, this is a fun, thoughtful, and surprising film.  You keep thinking the main character (Mark Duplass) is most certainly out of his mind, but then, the movie keeps reeling you back in, so you think, No, this guy's a genius, or something... Great acting by Aubrey Plaza, as the princess-of-irony and attitude newspaper intern who finally earns her way into Duplass' weird time-travel world of intrigue, black ops and paranoia.

5173515,3,B008OHV5R8,"I have got to stop reading ""blurbs"" on packaging. The blurbs on this DVD package indicated it would be a good movie, funny, sweet, charming, etc., a Sundance winner.  Mostly it was just vapid, silly, implausible to a fault and yet not clever enough to be a ""fairy tale"" type story. Not quite absurdist but definitely absurd. One of the many, many, many projects of recent years that seem to say, ""let's be quirky. let's by 'different.' let's be weird characters without any other point and see if that will look ""artistic"" and clever.""  It doesn't work. It is forced, contrived, nonsense.  I am a fan of Aubrey Plaza in ""Parks & Recreation"" (""April Ludgate"") and she was ""April"" in this movie but with a slightly sweeter, warmer edge here. The two males with whom she travels, her boss and the other intern, are so thoroughly unlikeable -for different reasons - that they distract from everything else in the movie, especially the ""boss"", a character so offensive and annoying that he would most likely be completely avoided by others, but not in this movie. His language, behavior and attitudes are abominable.  Then there is the character, ""Kenneth"" who is, what? depressed? psychotic? subversive? genius? Answer is: mostly just ridiculous and bizarre and not clearly defined as anything that makes sense. Movie ended at our house and there was almost simultaneous ""it was OK, at best.""  I wish I had not bought it. I wish one could still sell movies on Amazon. I would say this was a waste of money and time. The story ideas were not original, have been done before in other movies/TV, and the execution of the ideas in this movie was just sophomoric, weak.",1432425600,,1660,4.75

A magazine writer and two interns from Seattle attempt to track down the placer of a classified ad seeking a companion for traveling back in time. As they learn more about him, they begin to question if he is actually able to perform the feat.

What did I think?

The film initially threatens to drown in the quirks and indie precociousness of its premise, but the sharp script manages to dig deeper and find moments for the characters to reveal new layers and hidden motivations. The central performances by Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass are a real joy, giving aimless slackers everywhere a decent name. Youre kept guessing until the final moments about how things will play out and the conclusions, bar one frustrating side plot, are satisfying and uplifting.",1431648000,,778,4.834586466165414

5173518,3,B008OHV5R8,"This cute and gentle movie COULD have been awesome with just a little more attention to detail. The characters are sympathetic and relatable but their back-stories, which would have made them more real, is completely absent. It's as if in the final weeks the makers simply lost interest and walked away. I am talking about a total of 5 - 10 minutes more of filming to give the movie a more finished feel and introduction to the motivations of the characters. For example, many of the characters engage in behavior you don't understand until you realize from their actions what is driving them, while a set-up at the beginning would make them alot more engaging. Meanwhile, the main character, who is a time traveler, is made to look like a kook instead of some kind of mystterious scientist which he is. Some mystery needs to be added to give dramatic weight to the ending, which is never in doubt. You know how this movie is going to turn out, the fun is how you get there and this could have been better in this regard. The main characters have good romantic chemistry and look good together. It's just too bad that more effort wasn't expended making this movie from 3 to 4 stars. It would have cost them  next to nothing to achieve it.",1431302400,,1238,4.526785714285714
5173519,1,B008OHV5R8,"All I wanted was a few laughs on a Friday night, and the reviews here led me to believe that was a possibility with this film but NOPE. This is a script that needed better writers--ones with a sense of humor--and tons more editing. The simplistic story takes forever to get going, and the characters remain cardboard cut-outs of themselves from minute one!  Not one sub-plot feels even remotely developed--and don't get me started on how cartoonish the ""time-travel"" aspect seemed. The plot and the gags feel tired and recycled...I actually yawned more times than I laughed during this film. This might be a film you could put on and then fall asleep to or to have playing in the background when you're doing other, more ""interesting"" things--like dusting or lint-rolling all of your black garments.

Why the producers and promoters felt they HAD to use what moderate star power Bell provided to promote this movie is lost on me--mainly because it's such a great story.  The basic premise surrounds a mysterious classified ad that is looking for a special person to travel in time (presumably backward) with the ad's author.  The local newspaper gets wind  of the ad and assigns a reporter and a couple of interns charmingly and skillfully played by Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation), and the woefully geeky Karan Soni (from those AT&T commercials). They finally track down the paranoid author of the ad (Mark Duplass--also a producer with his brother on the film), and all kinds of quirky shenanigans begin.  Just as we're convinced Duplass is absolutely off his rocker, the story takes a fantastic turn with a very satisfying conclusion.  I would watch this movie as a double feature with ""I'll Follow You

""Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.""

Three people from the magazine decide to cover or uncover a story. At least that is how it appears on the surface. It may have been the original intent but as time progresses each finds their self and a road of discovery. It is like reading a Joseph Campbell story.

The execution is sort of on a lighthearted level but the encounters are anything but. If the viewer cannot relate to each of the characters then something has been mist in their journey through life and this film can be an eye opener.

Be sure to watch the DVD extras to see what the intent was and see if they accomplish the movie that this was intended to be. We also get a little insight as to the characters and the actors that played them.

This is ultimately a story about living with regrets vs. living in the here and now and the idea that if you really had a chance of changing one event from you past, would you change it and, if so, what event would you change. This little indie movie presents a sweet romance between a lost intern, Darius, and a man obsessed with changing his past and the trust slowly growing between them as they work towards doing the impossible and setting things right in their lives. And, in the process of watching this, you just might fall in love with movies again which, to me, achieves the goal of settings things right quite nicely.",1409961600,,833,4.4868421052631575
5173663,5,B008OHV5R8,"Loosely based on writer Derek Connolly's experience while working at a small magazine that needed to improve readership. Paramount mission: Locate interesting stories or pink slips would be prepared. Desperate, he found a classified ad that said:

""WANTED: Someone to go back in time with me. This is no joke. P.O. Box 91, Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.""

While the real story was what one would presume - linear and static - this movie takes the tack of asking:

Suppose the person were deadly serious?

So begins this tale.

A senior writer and two interns, one of which is beautiful Ms. Darius Britt, are assigned to run down the story - find out what it's all about, and if print worthy, their jobs are secure.

The smartass senior decides the guy who placed the ad is indeed serious. But having burned his introduction, they need another in.

Darius is ordered to go undercover and see where it leads. Misgivings are prompted in her own defense. The obvious fear is that this guy might be dangerous. However, as his job is on the line, he informs her that she's going or she's fired. Her complaint that he's ""dangling her vagina as bait"", only prompts her boss to comically further his point. He notes that if the guy turns out to be some kind of cannibal serial killer, ""The story only gets better.""

Resigned to her destiny, she rolls her eyes back into her head.

How to approach offbeat and reclusive Kenneth Calloway? Become someone he can relate to: A fellow conspiracist. And once the hooks are in - he carefully looks over his newest applicant, in particular noting her very sad eyes. He informs her that ""training"" begins immediately.

Suddenly, she's being drawn into Ken's world. One where mandatory daily exercise meets zombie survival guide, where zen meditation meets psychiatric exhumation, and stunning engineering crashes into outright criminality as the pair end up stealing state-of-the-art lasers from a government-funded laboratory. Darius now realizes that their collective efforts potentially endanger not just themselves but many other innocent people if Ken is allowed to proceed.

Yet, as her training continues, she comes to understand the man, his mission, and the terrible motivation which fuels his desperate desire to go back in time and fix what went so wrong. It's a feeling that she relates with only too well, coming from a place of deep hurt when she lost her mother when she was still a child. And what Ken is offering becomes so much more than a simple story to save her job.

Enter Homeland Security. Ostensibly, the theft has brought them looking for answers. But they seem to know so much more about ""The Mission"".

She doesn't know what to make of it all. Her sensibility yo-yos wildly between getting caught up in Ken's manic, but sincere exhortations; to outright disbelief culminating with her introduction to the so called ""time machine"" - which turns out to be nothing more than an old aluminum dingy sitting in a duck pond.

The senior writer and fellow intern are stepping back. They no longer want any part of this craziness. They insist she pull back too.

Darius dives in deeper.

Is he a broken but sympathetic genius? A temporal terrorist who might actually warp the timeline and cause unimagined havoc? Or just plain old mental patient crazy?

Overall, an outstanding indie that delves into our collective desire to change the past. Not for ourselves, but for those we love.

What motivates this impossible dream? We know we cannot ever go back in time, yet we continue to fuel our passion to explore this theme; to somehow make amends to those we have hurt and eliminating those individuals whose hurts have been inflicted upon us.

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" explores those issues thru the eyes of two damaged souls in a clever and, surprisingly, fresh take in the Time Travel genre.

5173695,3,B008OHV5R8,"Having known about the internet meme from almost the beginning, I expected this movie to be much funnier.  Much more tongue in cheek.  Maybe even slapstick.  Instead, it's a semi-sappy love story with a very indie-vibe.

Three journalists (Aubrey Plaza, Jake Johnson, Karan Soni) investigate a ridiculous want ad about time travel.  They find a bizarre loner (Mark Duplass) who is sincere about his time traveling exploits.  The result is that each journalist discovers something about themselves, realizing what really makes them happy and what makes them love.  They realize their strengths, weaknesses, and individuality is geared towards a specific person, and sometimes it's not who they expect.  Duplass comes off as an unfunny MacGruber, and Plaza is the same bland character she was in every other thing in which you've seen her.  Johnson has a moment here and there, but even he's unconvincing.

They warped a very unique story, something that could have been completely original, into The Notebook.  Simply put, this movie did not push it to the limit.",1398816000,,1062,5.152046783625731

That's the classified advert which starts off this quirky indie comedy thriller. The heroine, Darius (played by Aubrey Plaza) is one of two interns assigned to accompany cynical senior reporter Jeff (Jake Johnson) on an assignment to track down whoever placed this advert and discover the truth behind it in hopes of a story.

It soon becomes clear that Jeff had ulterior motives for proposing this assignment and asking for two interns to accompany him.

The journalists track down Kenneth (Mark Duplass), the man who placed the advert, but he doesn't quite appear to be what any of them had expected ...

This isn't a time-travel film, it is a film about relationships and particularly what goes through the minds of Darius and her colleagues as they try to work out whether Kenneth is a looney, a fraudster, or whether there is any chance that he really can build a time machine.

Some good acting by the relatively unknown cast, a large helping of amusing humour in the plot, but it never crosses over the line between humour and farce.

5173708,5,B008OHV5R8,"Spoilers below. . .

Safety Not Guaranteed is like a romantic comedy or chick-flick except it is geared toward men. Looked it up, it is considered a 'time-travel romantic comedy'. Critic Roger Ebert gave the film a glowing review, especially praising the script. It won a screenwriters award. I have to agree with the late Mr. Ebert, this is a wonderful movie. I watched the film a second time and enjoyed it even more. There's a little song that goes with the film called, 'The Machine'.

The story is about three writers for 'Seattle Magazine' (a male and a female intern, and their boss), tasked to write a story about a newspaper-classified that is advertising time travel. Jeff, their boss, volunteers to cover the story because the ad was placed in a small town that also happens to hold an ex-girlfriend that he wants to hook up with again. Before the article is finished all three will be involved in a romance. The female intern, 'Darius', will have developed feelings for the man who claims he can time travel. Much of the film is about finding who placed the ad, and then Darius infiltrating his set-up as she volunteers to be the traveling companion he is advertising for. She probably is named 'Darius' because she's a bit daring and the (non-depressed side of her) is mouthy. She's bold and mouthy.

Kenneth, the reputed time traveler, who placed the ad, trains for his next time travel journey by running, doing calisthenics, and practicing shooting in the woods. He constantly uses words like 'the mission'. It's slightly amusing. Kenneth acts a little weird. He wants to go back in time to 2001 and change things. Watching a second time, I paid more attention to the making of the film (or how I imagine it must have been made). I think they (Kenneth and Darius) are holding real guns and really firing them in the woods. There's a short, funny scene in the movie where Kenneth is running back and forth in front of Darius and Darius kind of laughs or smiles out of character (she's holding a real gun). The filmmakers decide to include the scene in the film. Kenneth robs a tech store in the film, and when Darius see's the gun being used in a robbery (she's in the getaway car) she's taken a little aback. Kenneth says something like 'Don't worry' as if it's not loaded and then says, 'here, take it', and gives it to her saying, 'This will make you feel safer'. That is the end of guns in the film.

Kenneth is the picture book of the kind of guy women's magazines advise readers to avoid. Every article written in a women's magazine, every person ever to give advice, has told women to avoid, not just anything questionable, but just this guy, and if somehow unavoided, just leave him. Every daytime TV show ever aired has had this same message (with the exception of the Steve Harvey Show)? Every thing in Kenneth's life is a red flag, not the least of which is his belief that he can travel in time. When she tells her boss, 'the guy could kill me or something'. He replies, 'good, then it will be a better story'. One reviewer called Kenneth 'a wanna be unibomber', another 'part of the tin-foil hat and black helicopter crowd'. This is the kind of guy we've been warned about but the film makes him likable and in fact the reporter falls in love with him. In this sense the film is an escape from the real world. Perhaps most films are. Another review notes that Kenneth falls in love with her too, but like a typical guy, doesn't know it himself until the very end of the play. It's not hard to believe, Darius was just too cute in the film.

Jeff, I think (other than Darius at times being very cute), is my favorite character in the film . . . both Darius, and Jeff, her boss, are just very honest in the film. They play off each other well. Poet Maya Angelou once claimed that the most important virtue is courage because without courage one cannot practice any other virtue consistently. Their honesty is believable in the film. The writer characters are very honest, but it is almost as if the rest of the film is an ode to some weird guy the writer used to date.

Jeff, in the film, gets kicked out of a couple of places including from the stands of a local high school football game. In the extra footage attached to the film, the director points out that the writer says that the three main characters are based, somewhat, on her personality. I'll go with that . . . The three writers in the film all portray different aspects of her personality. Closer loser to the truth - Mark Twain's observation that a good writer always has his friends with him. It all does make a good movie.

Thinking of the screenwriter, I was reminded of an episode of the Sci Fi show 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'. In the episode, the crew go back in time to the 1950's where they find themselves Sci Fi writers working for the magazine 'Incredible Tales' with one writing a story called 'Far Beyond the Stars'. The Black character and the female character, both writers for the magazine, are asked 'not to come in to work the next day', company photo day. In our modern times, in a diversity-obsessed society, what would be the purpose of actually reducing the images of diversity we see? To promote a kind of White supremacy? To keep the 'workers' happy? To sell more tickets to those who are more the targeted audience? Propaganda is thought more effective if it comes from our own kind? To increase alienation or resentment?

At the end of the film, there is a voice-over of one of the actors talking. The film both begins and ends perfectly. The film is at its strongest when Jeff is reuniting with his old high school fling. Time travel is meant to be a metaphor for revisiting this relationship. This is just at one point, the film doesn't continue in this direction. Sadly, Jeff and his old girlfriend cannot quite come to terms. The third romance is between the male intern, Arnau, who is portrayed as a virgin, and a young girl they meet. Both of the earlier love affairs take or appear to take time to develop. In the final love affair, their boss just sits the two youngsters beside each other and leaves. The young couple begin kissing before, presumably, doing it. I've noticed, in these romances, it always seems that whoever is together in the movie, they'll have an affair. In real terms this would mean you should have an affair with the boy who sits beside you in school. Perhaps this (what seems like is happening) is done because of film length concerns. Maybe I'm old fashioned, or a supporter of patriarchy, or a chauvinist, but personally, I would like to one day marry a woman who is a virgin -- too bad I can't travel back in time to before 2001 and 'apologize'. To be honest, I'd also like to have sex, marriage or not, or even if I never marry. . .

Perhaps there is some 'classism' in the film in that Arnau, once or twice, mentions to the group that 'Darius is a very attractive young lady'. He's just telling the truth (and perhaps his approach might serve as a dating-tip to viewers). By being honest, he is really begging for sex, or begging to be able to date the young woman that he notes, is, 'a very attractive young woman'. Jeff tells him a couple of times, 'easy Arnau'. Darius is too good (and the two youngsters are portrayed as virgins) to get with Arnau so easily, but Jeff does set him down with an (even younger) lady who might appear to have a bit more experience.

This is just a great fantasy that is just so much the opposite of real life. I'm going with the story . . . but one thing I have to say . . . If you're dating a guy who acts a little weird, maybe it's you.",1393200000,,7628,4.446032880629021

The leading characters are played by actors who haven't had many leading roles, which suits the movie well. The story is of the obscure goings-on of unknown people in a small town, and how they develop over time. Is the reporter intern just playing along for the story?

5173759,4,B008OHV5R8,"I enjoyed this movie, first and foremost, for the premise: the absurd idea that a guy built a time machine and is looking for a time-travel partner. Not the first time this plot device has been tried. Yet, in Safety Not Guaranteed, it is more a metaphor than an actual necessity. Pile in a bunch of great actors and you have a fine movie about not fitting in, living stereotypes, and what it takes to live a dream. In the beginning, a magazine reporter and his two interns seek out the time machine builder. They quickly find him and the female intern plunges into his world to find out what's really going on. She's as quirky as the guy she's stalking and soon the two fit together hand in glove. Aubrey Plaza plays the female lead brilliantly, balancing the off-beat with the sincere, her character's job with her character's desire for a connection to someone. The story meanders a bit (that's why 4 stars instead of 5) through the past of our intrepid and arrogant lead reporter. He tries to help the other intern score chicks while hooking up with his own past love. Nonetheless, this movie is a slow-burn with the best of intentions all culminating in a bit of a surprise at the end that leaves everyone agog. What I liked most was how the script maintained a sort of low-intensity tension that built gradually but steadily. This is hard to do in a movie like this and the screenwriter and director deserve mountains of credit for not going too far with the gags or maudlin with the love-story.

Let's start with the plot, a quirky enough premise that sends a trio of unlikely compatriots on a quest to find who is placing classified ads for a companion to time travel. Yet the more the idea unfolds, the more unlikely it seems that the main character could really pull off such a feat as we see him in action. The subplots range from annoying to inane, really mostly dead-ends that do little to support the main theme or offer the characters much to do other than be boring or annoying.

None of the characters really seem like folks we could ever connect with, and their lack of chemistry around each other just adds to the lackluster tone and energy of the movie.

By the time the climax rolls around, it is hard to care what happens to anyone, much less believe that this time-travel flick is the real deal.",1376956800,2,1044,4.572192513368984

5173767,5,B008OHV5R8,"Most films with a science fiction element go for the big spectacle and visual effects missing out on the most important element of storytelling--the people. ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is about reconnecting with our emotions, our humanity and those opportunties we've missed out on and want to fix.

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" which was based on a real ad that appeared in Backwoods Magazine as filler and a joke, is a character driven, quirky mixtured of comedy and drama.

SPOILERS:

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" focuses on an oddball where Ken Calloway (Mark Duplass) a lost soul claims to have figured out a way to travel back through time. He wants to fix something from his past that had a massive impact on him but he's also looking for a partner to share the journey. A journalist (Jake Johnson)takes on the assignment because it will allow him to reconnect with an old flame while Darius Britt (Aubrey Plaza)and Arnau (Karan Soni) goes along because it will provide them with a bit of adventure in their otherwise dull life. What the trio uncover is more than just a disturbed individual who can't separate fantasy from reality and it, ultimately, changes all their lives in different ways.

END OF SPOILERS:

If you come to ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" expecting a big budget visual effects driven movie, you'll be disappointed; the scale of the film is small and focuses on the character interactions.

The Blu-ray presentation of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is quite nice although it isn't a perfect presentation (possibly due to the source); the outdoor scenes look positively stunning. Skin tones look natural and the colors are natural looking. The earlier, indoor scenes, however, aren't quite as detailed looking and aren't quite as strong.

The DTS-HD 5.1 sounds quite nice with the dialogue sounding clear and the ambient sound effects are often quite subtle but they are there.

The special features, unfortunately, aren't quite as strong probably due to the low budget assigned to the home video release. We get ""A Movie Making Mission"" which is a typical ""making of"" featurette with very little insight garnered or any great behind-the-scenes stories.

Likewise ""The Ad Behind the Movie"" is all too brief. I would have loved to hear more about what those who first read the ad not knowing it was a goof might have thought of it including those at the magazine. Still, as brief as it is, it does give us a bit of insight into the origin of the film. We also get previews for other films.

Ultimately people decide if they like a film as much based on the beginning and ending of the film (at least in my experience) more than the rest of the content of the film. The director manages to pull off a number of difficult tasks with ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" and does so quite well on a very limited budget. It's an impressive movie that reminds us that for every film that is about the spectacle, there needs to be just as many about the people with well drawn and defined characters.

The movie progresses a little slow but you have to hang in there until the end to appreciate its unique take. You are left to wonder throughout the movie about where this is going to go and how its going to end. The story could have been written a bit better and a little more cohesively as well.

But the ending leaves you surprised and although it is not the best movie I have ever seen, I enjoyed it being different than your normal popcorn movie. At least this story has some creativity in it, unlike a lot of Hollywood is turning out these days.",1373155200,,934,4.325714285714286
5173799,4,B008OHV5R8,"For all the criticisms of M. Night Shamalayan, he must be given credit for making the twist ending a stable part of Hollywood movies.  Saying that, this movie is part drama, part comedy for about the first half of it.  In the second half the movie becomes a romance film, and it finishes as a science fiction - fantasy film.  From the title and brief description of the film, you can probably figure out what happens in the end.  The acting is good, the casting is spot on, and the dialogue is very believable.  For a low budget film like this which came out under the radar in 2012, it features better writing, on-screen chemistry, and a more believable plot than bigger name releases of that year such as Prometheus, Snow White and the Huntsman, and Avengers.  All in all, well worth the 1.5 hours watching it.",1372723200,,812,4.489795918367347

5173802,3,B008OHV5R8,"An enjoyable, but not great (or even average) foray into territory originally homesteaded by Nicholas Meyer's ""Time After Time"".  If only this serviceable tale of romance had been produced by someone with a checkbook. What is an otherwise perfectly adorable movie is marred by sloppy editing, film school-grade directing, and rehearsal-grade acting.  It's still watchable because an underlying love story shines through just when you think the film is ready to fall apart.  Basic storyline is highly creative and keeps you guessing until the end when some freakishly bad special effects confirm your suspicion that the only reason you're still watching the movie is because you want to watch the lead characters finally fall in love.  There's plenty of room for a sequel which, hopefully, will have enough budget for second takes and quality ADR.  Jake Johnson plays a time traveler who has placed an ad in the paper (a dead giveaway he's from the past?) to find a fellow (time) traveler.  Aubrey Plaza's character, a reporter who believes she's hot on the trail of a good story, responds, and fnds herself providing the love interest to our quirky time traveler; a typical guy who won't realize he's in love until much later in the film. There's not much of a time travel story here, but Tin-foil hat and black helicopter story elements create drama and a few chase scenes, while our hero's ramshackle boat, half sinking from the weight of Radio Shack dumpster recoveries, provides our lovers' getaway vehicle.  Bonnie and Clyde they ain't, yet we care because they are loveably innocent.  Not bad enough for mocking and heckling with your robot friends - better save this movie for those in-between paycheck date nights.",1371427200,,1722,5.017543859649122

I've never been a big fan of comedy movies of any type. And, I won't be looking at a whole lot of romantic comedy movies just because of this one.  Most comedy movies just don't move me in any way.

There are a few over-the-top moments/scenes, but they work out extremely well. I just watched it last night and I still can't stop thinking about it. Aubrey does an amazing job portraying someone who's not mainstream, and staying true to who she really is. She doesn't try to fit in because it's what most of us do that are considered different. She holds strong to who she is, and gets rewarded in the end. This movie, (a romantic comedy), had me very caught up in it. I even jumped a few times as my emotions went into over-drive. Yeah, a movie like this with superb audio also. What more can anyone ask for in an extremely good movie. I never imagined the audio/soundtrack of a romantic comedy would move me like this.

5173808,3,B008OHV5R8,"This movie was on pace to EASILY be a top-tier low-budget movie with the likes of Juno and Terminator.  But the last 5 minutes everything spun out of control and flipped through the ditch.  In essence there were too many ends left untied.  There were so many thoughtful story lines intertwined into well written characters, but I now feel like the director simply stumbled into that and when arriving there had no actual idea what to do with it.  Great characters should crescendo and discover they've got what it takes, or that there's a nugget of good within them - not leave the audience wondering why someone bothered to write them in.

Why didn't the guy pick up the phone and tell his boss to shove it and share a moment of discovery and passion instead of storming out like a mad 2 year old?

Why did they go back in time if the guy already got the girl he wanted?

Why did she kiss him around the campfire - reserve that moment for the boat.  ""I changed my plans, I was going back for you"" - *kiss* - ""You don't have to, I'm coming with you"".

Why does everyone stand there with their thumb up their butt when the boat disappears?  This ain't Rocky V dude, put your arm down and go tell that girl you actually love her.

Why is the poor Indian intern reduced to a college frat boy? A+ for sex with a minor, champ.

Why carry the laptop the whole freaking movie and do nothing with it?  Why not discover the ex girlfriends location on that instead of the boss calling?

Why have this incredible story line about the old army truck and boyscout campground and just let it hang off the end?  They could have had a note blow out of the box and get stuck on a tree that was a wedding invitation - show the machine worked, show the happily ever after.  I bet an 8 year old could have wrapped this up tighter.

5173831,3,B008OHV5R8,"For a film that was hyped and buzzed as incredibly unique and special, `Safety Not Guaranteed' didn't win me over like I wanted it to.  Outside of the fantastic cast, I really didn't find this to be all that engaging, unique or special.  At the end of the day, it was marginally funny and only occasionally insightful, and if it weren't for Aubrey Plaza's exceptional blend of dead pan comedic chops and tender reserved emotional temperance the film probably would have fallen apart completely.  I'm all for the quirky indie, but this just didn't seem to pair well with what it was promising.

It felt cheap.

Plaza, Johnson, Duplass and Soni make the most of their roles and try really hard to make this film draw you in, but Derek Connolly's script just isn't up to par.  It isn't that he doesn't carve out a moving finale and `reveal', but the way he actually goes about etching out that development is just not quite `there'.  Basically, this follows a team of journalists who are investigating an ad placed in the paper looking for something to go back in time with a disturbed man named Kenneth.  Jeff takes the story because he wants to hook up with an ex-girlfriend, and he takes Darius (who wants to go for more personal reasons) and Arnau with him as assistants.  Darius becomes the guinea pig as she's sent to persuade Kenneth to take her on his journey with him.  Of course, all isn't as black and white as it seems and Darius begins to fall for Kenneth and put faith in his claims and, well, if you decide to watch this then I'll leave the ending a surprise.

My issue is that it just doesn't always connect tonally.  It feels like a poorly constructed television show most of the time, with the gags landing slowly and the action awkwardly slapstick in a way that feels off kilter with the direction of the film.  Still, Plaza is really, really good here and so I hate to say `skip it' when her performance is that special.  She's got a major career ahead of her.

If you like quirky indie comedies with heart then I'm sure you've already seen this or at least contemplated it.  I love them too, but this one didn't do it for me.",1366675200,3,2143,4.456410256410257

Basic storyline - A journalist and two interns search for a man who placed an ad in the newspaper asking for a time traveling partner, safety not guaranteed.  One of the interns ends up connecting with the man and together they prepare for their travel.  Throughout the process, they both learn lessons about love, trust and letting go of what you know to be true.  Mark Duplass is amazing in the lead role.  He plays a man that could have easily been cartoonish and silly but was anything but that.  Funny, heartbreaking and inspiring are fair words to sum up the character.  I love Aubrey Plaza and she plays the same type of woman in everything she is in but in this movie, she let the softer side shine.  I don't know if she's the best actor but she is someone I really like to watch and enjoy the projects she chooses.  The B story is the journalist's struggle with the realization that he is getting older.  It is also a touching story that probably could have used it's own movie but Jake Johnson really does an amazing job of taking his character on a full journey in the realitively short amount of time devoted to his story.

5173878,4,B008OHV5R8,"I wanted to check this movie out because the powers that be at Universal (and Steven Spielberg) put their trust in the 4th installment of the Jurrasic Park franchise to Director Colin Treverrow.  Treverrow has directed only one other film and that is this delightful movie ""Safety Not Guaranteed"".  Being that ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" and ""Jurrasic Park 4"" are two completely different stories, it remains to be seen how well he helms ""4"" but if you just go by the task of directing I believe he can handle the job.
But, back to ""Safety Not Guaranteed"".  I really liked this movie.  I liked the cast, the cinematography, the directing and especially the story.  Actors Aubrey Plaza (NBC's Parks & Recreation) and Mark Duplass own this movie.  It's a joy to watch their relationship take off.  Plaza's deadpan acting style will grow on you as she slowly begins to get what Duplass's likable, but weird character is all about.  It will be interesting to see where these two fine actors go in their careers.  Another actor that is beginning to grow on me is Jake Johnson (Fox's New Girl).  He makes you believe that his character, reporter ""Jeff"", a sarcastic and despicable skirt chasing jerk is not such bad guy after all.  There is a story for each of the main characters and Treverrow puts it all together and wraps it up nicely.  ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is a very nice easy to follow and sweet film for just about everyone.  Do yourself a favor, rent this film (or stream it from Netflix) and take the time to enjoy it.  I don't think you'll regret it.

5173897,4,B008OHV5R8,"This film was inspired by the September/October 1997 issue of Backwoods Home in which a joke ad filled the classifieds:

""Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.""

The plot picks up by treating the classified as a real ad, which piques the interest of a Seattle magazine. Mistreated interns Darius Britt (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni) are roped into the assignment by disaffected journalist Jeff Schwensen (Jake Johnson).  The impromptu road trip leads them to Ocean View to profile the author of the ad: Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass), a stock clerk at a local grocery store.

Jeff's real plan for visiting Ocean View is to visit ex-girlfriend Liz (Jenica Bergere), a fling from his teenage years. Jeff seems to be chasing not just memories of his time with Liz but his own lost youth, a youth he projects onto Arnau.  Meanwhile, Darius - who has been moping through life since the murder of her mother - connects with Kenneth in unexpected ways.  It's a lot like ""Ghost World,"" only with college students.

At the heart of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is a question of authenticity.  Kenneth believes he can time travel when everyone else thinks he's a loon.  Conversely, Kenneth can immediately sense that nothing about Jeff is genuine, which is why he connects with Darius instead.  Jeff doesn't know what's genuine anymore - he's an unlikeable sleaze ball who has interns do all of his work - and desperately seeks to recapture his own lost youth.  Rumors of conspiracy theories and government agents culminate in a series of revelations about the true nature of everyone involved.

SPOILER GUARANTEED: ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is predictable if you know the genre. Fans of the sci-fi movie genre know that in any film involving time travel, the time travel is always real. It's hard to blame the directors - time travel is a big payoff - but the secret to their success is more about the destination than the journey.

5173917,1,B008OHV5R8,"This movie reveals that actress Aubrey Plaza has no range as an actress. She pretty much recreated her April character of ""Parks"" here--although I'm sure that wasn't intentional. I'm guessing the very last thing she wanted to do was come across as stiff and expressionless as her April character, but unfortunately that's what she does. And Mark Duplass was miscast as the anti-social uni-bomber wannabe. Even the most mediocre actors typically do well playing misfits--and it usually makes their career. However, Duplass was just a bland hunk of flesh with absolutely no fascinating characteristics in this movie. And then there's the shmuck actor playing the shmuck magazine journalist. It's just hard to believe that character was able to conceal his greasy weaselly shallow persona long enough for his old high school interest to develop feelings for him. As a matter of fact, the only credible actor in this movie was the woman that played her. Very natural and believable. And, by the way, are techy geeks the only roles young eastern Indian males actors are given these days??

There were also just so many minute flaws popping up all over the place--such as the three journalists not really putting much effort into not being seen together by the Duplass character. Or Aubrey convincing the FBI within a matter of seconds that she's not an accomplice of Duplass's. And then there's the scene at the end where the journalists freak out because the FBI are approaching them with fears of being sent to prison dancing in their heads--but then they suddenly discovering Duplass left his garage door open and think it's the perfect time to casually snoop around the place (""Hey! Look at all this stuff! What was he building in here??"" A freakin' TIME MACHINE, you morons! Remember??).

But the over-all irritant of the movie is its heavy-handed attempt to pull at our heart strings. I can't count how many times the director had Aubrey Plaza cast a clandestine smile as an endearing reaction to something ""weird"" Duplass had done. Or the uber-sappiness of Duplass's coworker being given a box of money just to drive the fact home our ""crazy"" guy has a huge heart of gold under those layers of paranoia and delusion--and of course Aubrey's reaction to that gesture is a heartfelt smile in his direction when she knows he's not looking.

I have a feeling the majority of the positive reviews here were written by people under thirty that have had no exposure to GOOD quirky indie romance comedies. And I also doubt they've spent much time exploring movies of the 1930s, 40s and 50s that churned these girl-meets-geek type movies practically on a weekly basis--and each one being better than the next. Frank Capra this movie's director is NOT.

5173967,4,B008OHV5R8,"SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is an off-beat, low-key independent romance/comedy/drama.  It will most assuredly not be for everyone.  It's talky.  It features characters with lots of annoying characteristics....people we might not like much if we met them in real life.  But it also features a very original basic idea and some moments of genuinely earned laughs and other moments of truly deserved...well, not tears exactly, but at least warm feelings.

The story begins in the newsroom of a Northwestern City newspaper.  The editor is looking for story ideas, and one reporter suggests that he go interview the guy who ran odd wanted ad.  The ad says, essentially, that he's looking for a partner to travel in time with him, must bring own weapon, safety not guaranteed.  And he mentions that he's only traveled in time once before.  The story is quirky enough for the reporter (NEW GIRL's Jake Johnson) to get the gig.  He heads off with two interns, including moody, shy Aubry Plaza (from PARKS AND RECREATION).  They stalk the time traveler (the seemingly ubiquitous Mark Duplass...at least, in movies like this), and while he rejects working with Johnson...he does take a tentative liking to Plaza.

Johnson plays a truly annoying jerk who has other reasons for coming to this small town...and he doesn't care much about the story he's chasing.  But Plaza and Duplass, the stars of the film, develop a very interesting friendship.  It reminded me of a low key version of the Bradley Cooper/Jennifer Lawrence pairing in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK.  Two damaged people finding a connection, but not being miraculously ""fixed"" or ""cured"" by the new relationship.  Their scenes are talky, but quite witty and frequently touching.  Turns out that Duplass has a very specific time-travelling task in mind, and Plaza has a very specific goal in mind herself.  Naturally, Plaza doesn't actually believe they'll be travelling in time, but she seems to enjoy going along with the fantasy.  Duplass appears to be DEAD serious, though.

The time travel aspect is certainly important to the film, particularly as the end approaches.  But most of the movie is an exploration of troubled relationships, loss and regret.  This sounds depressing, but the film never gets lower than melancholy.  This is not a wallow.  You won't need any Kleenexes to get you through.  But (much like the thoroughly enjoyable ROBOT AND FRANK), the sci-fi trappings are fun to experience and prevent this indie movie from dipping too hard into clich&eacute;s and actually give some familiar themes a feeling of freshness.

SAFETY...  rambles a bit too aimlessly at times.  The Jake Johnson character fails to win sympathy where clearly it is being sought.  But the delightful Plaza and the less-annoying-than-usual Duplass are great fun to watch, and the movie is never less than interesting.  I do recommend it.",1360108800,,2871,5.085653104925053

In 1997, a classified ad appeared in a survivalist magazine which read: ""Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before."" The ad eventually became a sensation on the internet and the basis for the movie, 'Safety not Guaranteed'.

If you're expecting this film to be a contribution to some dark world of brooding, noir-like sci-fi, you'll have to look elsewhere. Director Colin Tovorrow is a talented enough director but one wonders why he chose Derek Connolly's quirky comedy as his first feature film. On the surface, the concept appears to be a whole lot of fun, but for a number of reasons, it ultimately leaves one with both a dour and sour taste.

I realize this film is supposed to be a fantasy of sorts, but there's no question that the film lacks verisimilitude. I'll skip around here for a moment in referring to the plot, just as an example. What exactly is up with those government agents? These bumbling fools arrive at the house to take down Kenneth, and it sure takes them a quite a bit of time to chase the paranoid 'time traveler', after he runs out of the back of the house. When they finally get to the lake, do they draw their guns and at least command Kenneth to get out of the boat and apprehend him? Or do they end up standing around like a bunch of schmucks and let him accomplish his nefarious goals? If the point is that they're just a bunch of buffoons, to my mind that's simply an example of weak, weak storytelling.

The same goes for what happens after the inciting incident. The editor approves Jeff's idea to investigate the so-called 'time traveler' and sends him, along with the two interns, to find out who the nut job is. Fine enough. But after Kenneth rejects Jeff, then you must suspend your disbelief that Darius is allowed to gain Kenneth's trust, despite the fact that he's obviously paranoid and dangerous (imagine the kind of lawsuits the magazine would be subject to, if harm had come to Darius). Of course all you lovers of quirk will object by saying that it's supposed to be silly, and that's the whole charm of it!

If there's any saving grace in 'Safety Not Guaranteed', it's in Ms. Plaza's performance, who acquits herself well as she handles the raving Kenneth with aplomb. An opportunity for some really cool time travel is lost however, when Darius admits that she lost her mother when she was young but there's no attempt later on to send her back and perhaps prevent the awful event from occurring.

Where Mark Duplass manages to be charming under the direction of Lynn Shelton in 'Humpday' and 'Your Sister's Sister', as Kenneth, he's a complete, unlikeable loser. All respect for the character is lost when the film's scenarist allows him to actually commit a burglary, stealing lasers from a restricted facility. Why Darius plays along is mystifying.

For awhile Jake Johnson as Jeff does well in conveying an overall noxious demeanor and imperious hold over the interns. Eventually, after looking up his long lost high school love, Liz, he turns into a love sick puppy dog, begging her to abandon her life in the small town and come back with him to the city. Wouldn't you know it that after being rejected by Liz, he plays mentor to Arnau, and encourages him to get laid with some local teenage girls they pick up in town. It seems to be a common requirement of films of this ilk, to depict the rite of passage as a young male finding the gumption to end his virginity once and for all.

Much has been said of the 'clever' ending. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. Yes, crazy Kenneth turns out to have been telling the truth. The paranoid loser is actually a genius, outwits government agents and gets the girl. One problem is that we never get to see if he changes time (too bad dear reader, you expect too much!).

For lovers of quirk, 'Safety Not Guaranteed' will prove the breakout comedy hit of 2012. Other more discerning critics I'm convinced will see this first feature effort as partly unpleasant, but really just far more silly.",1359417600,,4200,4.589333333333333
5174008,5,B008OHV5R8,"To be honest, of late, I've found it less appealing to check out indie cinema, because too much of it seems to rely on trying to be too relevant, too hip, too irreverant, or just too strange to be something truly enjoyable. Thankfully director Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly decided to skip much of the pretense of indie cinema and go straight for the heart, mind and funnybone with SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED. Also thankfully, they got the right people for the right parts. Aubrey Plaza (who I honestly have only ever seen in SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD, but left a wonderful impression), Mark Duplass and Jake Johnson are all superb in this very brisk indie rom-com which will restore your faith in film's power to inspire.

I can't say too much about this film that hasn't already been said, particularly in the Amazon Editorial Review, which hits every point on why this film is so special with unfailing accuracy. The relationship between Plaza and Duplass's characters is never something that feels telegraphed. You never know from one moment to the next what's going to happen between the two of them. Also nice is not bogging the film down at all in over-reaching for the ""science"" of the time-travel device that Kenneth (Duplass) is creating. In fact, we never really hear a word about it, other than Kenneth's need for lasers (which leads to one of the funniest sequences of the whole film) and how his calculations are ""frickin' spot-on"".

SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED is not necessarily just a catchy title based on a potentially-unsettling part of the want-ad that Kenneth leaves, but it's how we go through life and love and how nothing is either safe or guaranteed, but sometimes, you just have to take someone's hand on faith, and it might lead you to heartache caused by the person you've always dreamed of, but it also might lead you to the person you never expected.

Couldn't take my eyes off the screen!

Disclaimer: I am not related to anyone involved in this movie. I just wish the cast and crew would make a bunch of sequels! If they can keep the charm alive and not lose the wonderful campy look of reality vs what Hollywood pumps out, this could easily be Dr. Who with humor included. Absolutely loved it!!!

5174064,2,B008OHV5R8,"This oddball of a movie falls in a unique category of romantic sci-fi comedy. I wish they had been able to pull it off! :(

The concept is awesome -- a Washington newspaper trio investigates a mysterious classifieds ad, in which a man is seeking a time traveler partner (bring your own weapons). Unfortunately, the majority of the movie is focused on character development, rather than plot development. There is virtually very little plot; you instead just watch the characters reveal details about their pasts to each other. Too much talking, odd romances, and the Indian kid had no real role... Why was he even in the movie? He might have been solely there for comic relief, but halfway through the movie, you forget he exists. They should have played him up more!

When there IS progression in plot, however, it's GREAT! I really enjoyed the 20% of the movie that was actually about time traveling. The movie does an incredible job of making you wonder, ""Can he actually time travel, or is he just crazy?"" There's an interesting balance between the two, which made me doubt myself and keep changing my mind -- this is definitely my favorite takeaway from 'Safety Not Guaranteed.'

If you have an hour and a half to spare, I recommend you watch something else. On the other hand, if you're really interested in this, you should give it a shot, ONLY because the majority of reviews seem to be against me. Statistically, you're probably going to like it. I was NOT a fan of 'Little Miss Sunshine' (which shares the same director), and noticeably, I am not a fan of 'Safety Not Guaranteed' for many of the same reasons.",1358467200,2,1619,4.673684210526316

She makes a brief cameo about two-thirds of the way through the film, and using her name so prominently feels a bit like bait-and-switch.  This minor complaint does not take away from the enjoyment this film provides. Stumbling upon Safety Not Guaranteed feels a bit like unexpectedly finding a great small restaurant that you want to immediately share with your friends.  The simple premise of the film is a cynical and somewhat disillusioned magazine writer finds an unusual classified ad that he thinks might make for a fun article. He convinces his grumpy editor (the always wonderful Mary Lynn Rajskub) to send him out with two college interns to find and interview the person who placed the ad.  The rest of the film is an amusing (but never condescending) character study of the magazine writer, the two interns, and the writer of the ad who is seeking out a companion to join him time traveling.

And yet Safety Not Guaranteed is a great film, one of my favorite of the year.  Without getting too far into the specifics of plot, it is human, endearing, and very funny.  Aubrey Plaza brings the same snark and standoffishness that defined April Ludgate but adds a vulnerability to the shtick that makes her far more human.  Jake Johnson is a hilarious douche.  But Mark Duplass strays the farthest from his TV persona and steals the show as the recluse who thinks he can time travel.

I first saw the trailer for Safety Not Guaranteed last March and I was excited because of those four TV stars.  The film basically follows three magazine employees (one full time, two interns) who respond to an ad requesting a partner for time travel.  Where it goes next, I'll leave a secret so that you'll watch it...but I will say that there's heart, vulnerability, and some great laughs as well.

5174189,3,B008OHV5R8,"I was intrigued by the storyline of ""Safety Not Guaranteed."" It is a thought-provoking film, but not one that I'd need to watch again hence the 3-star rating.

A seemingly paranoid man places an ad in his search for a partner to travel through time.  A journalist decides to investigate, but it quickly becomes obvious that his motives are self-serving as he hopes to reconnect with an old love.  He brings two interns with him on the investigation and Darius is successful at forming a real connection with the time traveller.  Ironically this is the most honest and deepest relationship of her life.  Darius reveals the pain of having lost her mother as a young woman and her regret at the last words she said to her mother.

There is an interesting contrast between time-travelling Kenneth and our disillusioned and embittered journalists.  Kenneth appears eccentric at best or crazy at worst, but he is oddly endearing regardless.  He has a greater purpose and pursues it with conviction, while our journalist heroes don't seem to believe in anything.  Faith in the wonder and magic of life is restored in the most unexpected of ways.  Perhaps that is the hidden gem of the movie; a reminder that faith is believing that things will improve or work out despite all indications to the contrary.  That sometimes we have to weather the unexpected surprises and blows that life brings our way knowing that the storm will pass and bring a new day.

The journalist (Jeff) is portrayed by Jake Johnson, who is Nick in TV's ""New Girl.""  I was curious to see him in something different, but in this film he recreates the same character.  Jeff is a flawed character who blusters through life to hide his vulnerabilities.  Just when things appear to be going his way, he resurrects his walls and sabotages a promising relationship.  People hoping to see Jake Johnson in a different context or light as I was will be disappointed.

In summary, it was an interesting and thought-provoking film.  I borrowed the film so did not feel cheated that I had paid too much for the movie as my investment was limited to the time I spent watching it.  Definitely worth the nearly two hours, just not the $20.",1357084800,,2189,4.728232189973615

I wish I could get everyone to see this movie because it's just one of those movies that draws you into their world. I didn't find it all that predictable like someone said.

5174243,2,B008OHV5R8,"I enjoyed Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist.  I enjoyed Juno.  I enjoyed Scott Pilgrim Verses The World. I like magical realism and I think quirky movies are fun.  But there is a certain trope of which I am even more tired than the sex-worker-with-a-heart-of-gold trope.  That trope is that mental illness is funny, quirky, lovable or ""crazy"" (in an adventurous sort of way).  I am not going to give away plot details but I am going to say something about the main character that might be considered a ******SPOILER/******** The main character is a White male in his 40's.  He lives out in the woods alone. He is willing to commit crimes in order to further his ""goal"". He likes guns and preparing for combat.  He is extremely socially awkward.  He has no real friends.  He has memories of what happened in his personal history that don't jive with actual facts.  He is highly intelligent in applied science. Instead of painting this character as a paranoid schizophrenic Ted Kazenski, or Timothy McVeigh or Adam Lanza type, the character is painted as a lovable, caring, ""misunderstood"" nice guy who, despite all the evidence is not actually crazy at all. *******/SPOILER*******  . Well, I am not buying it.

The female lead is no more believable.  She underwent a life altering event in her teens.  In her early 20's she is not engaged with life, detached.  Yet the plot never calls for her to question whether she actually got the therapy or meditation or spiritual whatever she needed to deal with her life altering event or whether not dealing with it has something to do with why she feels the way she feels now.

The movie's answer to how this young woman is going to get re-engaged with life is to have her fall in love with a man who, for all intents and purposes, seems crazy.  Yeah, that is it ladies.  You know that gun loving, combat preparing, living in the woods guy.  He is just misunderstood and he need YOU to have his back.  Once you give him your heart your own depression will lift, he will, in the next scene, really become the person you want him to be and all of both your problems will evaporate.  That is the kind of messaging that gets women beat and killed.",1356393600,5,2185,4.565552699228792

5174247,5,B008OHV5R8,"""Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 91 Ocean View, WA 99393. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.""

Who would think this joke an editor of Backwoods Home Magazine put in his magazine would spread to popular culture and end up as the plot of an extremely low budget and independent film called Safety Not Guaranteed. I doubt John Silveira the editor who posted the joke ever did. To be honest I had never heard of the magazine add before until I learned about this film, and I had never heard of this film until I saw the article at IGN called 20 Great Movies You Might Have Missed in 2012. I saw the film title, the synopses and the trailer and something about all of that drew me to this great film and I watched it over the weekend. Who knew a film based on a joke article and a nonexistent budget would turn in to such a great film, and Safety Not Guaranteed is a great film.

The film is really short at only around one hour and twenty five minutes long, so I shouldn't have to give to many details about the plot. Of course you know the basic plot line of the film with copy of the add I posted above. Jeff Schwensen (Jake M. Johnson) a journalist a Seattle, WA heads to an sea side town called Ocean View along with two interns Darius Britt (Aubrey Plaza) and Arnau (Karan Soni) to investigate and interview the man who posted the add. The story concentrates on disillusioned pessimist Darius who doesn't expect anything good out of life. When we first meet her she's interviewing for a job at a restaurant, but is too honest and doesn't get the job. She ends up at a magazine and heads to Ocean View with Jeff and Arnau. There she finds Kenneth Calloway (Mark Duplass) the man behind the add, and she follows him where Kenneth works at a local grocery store. These three don't expect anything from this trip as Jeff really came to look up his old girlfriend from his teenage years and don't really take Ken seriously, but as Darius goes undercover with Ken they form a bond and she begins to realize Ken is serious and what he says might be true. Wow a film with an actual original plot. This is the first film I've seen with a premise or plot like this and it works. Is the plot perfect? No it's not. I thought the character Arnau was out of place and wasn't developed well, and some might find the film boring. There are no great special effects you'd expect from a time travel film, and really the time travel elements aren't really important in the scheme of things it's about the characters and growth and experience throughout the film. The only real scene is the climax where Darius and Ken escape on their time machine boat.

The small cast is led by Aubrey Plaza who has mainly found a career doing independent films and guest appearances on TV shows. Aubrey brings Darius to life perfectly displaying her hopelessness with life in her eyes and face and how they slowly come to life throughout the film and her dealing with Ken. Jake Johnson I think is probably best known for his role on the Fox comedy New Girl. Jake plays the slacker Jeff perfectly as he finds he wants more in life after he meets his ex-Liz. Mark Duplass along with Aubrey steal the film. From what I've learned about Mark he's an actor, writer, director and producer who's done mainly independent and low budget films. Along with acting in this film he also produced it. As an actor Mark gives real depth to Ken and gives a really engaging performance. Probably the best known actor or actress in the film is Kristen Bell in a minor role. I remember when there was such praise for the actress with role Veronica Mars that was supposed to lunch the actress to major stardom, and has seemed to have fallen off the radar.

Is this film for everyone no I don't think so. The film has a really low budget that might be only around half a million. Also the time travel elements aren't important and only really make an appearance with the great and moving ending. I can understand some might find this gem of a film boring and uninteresting, but it's not. Safety Not Guaranteed is a heartwarming comedy of trying to find meaning and purpose along with an actually original plot, some minor sci-fi elements, great acting and good characters. I highly recommend everyone at least give this overlooked low budget film a try.",1356307200,,4427,4.421568627450981

What a surprise of a movie!! It's just awesome when you go into a theater for a film with no expectations for it to be as good as it ends up being. Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) is one of those rare theatrical treats. It just blew my mind at how fun and heartfelt it was considering its humble roots. It's a real testament to the power and potential of indie filmmaking in this day and age when the democratization of filmmaking is better than its ever been. Jus as the poster promises, if you liked Little Miss Sunshine (2006), then you'll probably dig this one. Not because the stories are similar, but because they're both filled with quirky and interesting characters that are on personal journeys.

Written by Derek Connolly and directed by Colin Trevorrow, Safety Not Guaranteed is the first feature film for both. And they really hit a home run (or at least a triple) with this one. The writing is superb with realistic dramatic dialog paired with great comedic punches. I laughed, I cried and really connected with the story on an emotional level. And of course that's in large part due to the phenomenal acting from Mark Duplass, Aubrey Plaza, Jake Johnson, and Karan Soni. The chemistry and camaraderie is just spectacular among these actors. They pulled off a story that in the hands of lesser actors, could go wrong really quickly.

With beautiful cinematography, good production design, solid editing and music that helps emphasize the story without overpowering it, Safety Not Guaranteed is guaranteed to take you away into a story that's both believable and unbelievable. I really don't want to say anymore because most of the fun of this film is knowing nothing going in. So I'll leave my review at that.",1355616000,,1748,4.759075907590759

Well, unfortunately, I have to bring these other reviews back down to earth... not by compensating with a one-star, but by giving it the star rating it deserves.  This is an okay movie; a 3-star movie.  It has its funny parts, and it has its sad and serious parts.  The story isn't terribly riveting, complicated, impressive, or particularly redeeming.  I would describe it as odd... mysterious... and a little slow at times.  It does peak some interest and curiosity (no worries... no spoiler alerts here), but I can't say that I am pleased to have paid a few bucks for the streaming rental.

If you're bored and you've seen everything that you'd like to see already, feel free to watch.  But if you're expecting your favorite Parks and Rec, New Girl, or The League character to be hilarious, fun, and impress you in another role, you're not going to find it here.

The movie takes characters you think you know in the beginning and takes them all on a journey, you don't know exactly who will end up where and in what mental state they'll be in but you want along for the ride nonetheless. I won't go into story as you no doubt have already read it but know, while it sounds far-fetched and bizarre, its executed eloquently with witty writing and an amazing setting that gives you this feeling all through the movie of being in a far off wonderland that you still feel at home in.

The only bumps in the road for me were I wished I'd seen more of some characters, you'll know who I'm talking about after but for the short span they each have their appearance they're so unique and hilarious you just want more of them.

And here I thought I made a great discovery!  Obviously, the secret is out.

This afternoon I saw the latest James Bond movie (Skyfall) at an IMAX.  The movie cost between $150m-$200m to make.  In a word, the 23rd Bond film was ""awesome""!

Tonight I needed something to come down from the adrenaline rush (and a coffee lovers waffle cone from Cold Stone Creamery).  I stumbled across ""Safety Not Guaranteed"".  Made with a budget of $750k (or 4-games salary for Arod, assuming he played in all 162-games) and starring Mark Duplass (of who I am a fan of in ""The League"") and Aubrey Plaza (whose work I didn't know, though I am a fan now).

The 2-movies that I saw today could not have been more different.  The brilliance of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is in it's simplicity.  That there is chemistry between Plaza and Duplass is clearly evident.  However, my personal connection to the film is based on a recurring fantasy I have about traveling back in time a day and mapping out a detailed strategy on how I can get rich as a result. While the movie offers a more noble pursuit, I couldn't help but root for it's success.

A great change of pace when you feel like something different.",1354320000,,1196,4.5327102803738315
5174414,5,B008OHV5R8,"Lately I've been teaching myself how to create and edit video, so when I watched this film I wore my ""director's"" hat instead of my ""viewer's"" hat. Despite my best effort to analyze each scene, I kept getting swept up in the movie as a viewer, and for that I give it 4.5 stars.

Aubrey Plaza plays Darius, an unhappy misfit intern at Seattle Magazine. Jake Johnson (from the Fox series, ""New Girl"") plays Jeff, an obnoxious magazine reporter who chooses two interns, Darius and Arnau (played by Karan Soni) to help investigate an ad written by someone wanting a time travel partner.

Is this time traveler serious about time travel? The three set off to find this person and write a story. During the film I kept wondering whether Kenneth (the ad writer) had actually built a time machine or was deluded.

Who might want to be cautious about this film...
  - People who aren't used to a slower pace. It's not a slow film, but it's slower, and there's plenty of conversation.
  - People who don't enjoy quirky films. I realize ""quirky"" is in the eye of the beholder. With that said, here's my very biased film list that may help guide you in deciding whether to see this film. If you like most of the films below, you'll likely enjoy ""Safety Not Guaranteed."" Not all of these are quirky, but they all have a lot of dialogue.

  - ""The Sixth Sense""
  - ""Being John Malkovich""
  - ""A Beautiful Mind""
  - ""Up"" (a Pixar film)
  - ""A History of Violence""
  - ""Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist""
  - ""Road to Perdition""
  - ""Up in the Air""
  - ""Frost/Nixon""
  - ""Moonrise Kingdom""

What I liked...
  - Good character development and performances. Characters felt real.
  - Intriguing story with good dialogue and pacing.
  - Very few spots dragged on. Just about every scene kept me interested.
  - It kept its balance (you'll know what I mean when you watch it).

What I didn't like...
  - I said I wouldn't give away spoilers.
  - But what I can say is that there were some ""holes"" in the story that bothered me.
  - I had mixed feelings about the ending as did some of the other reviewers.

Even with minor flaws, I give it 4.5 stars.",1354320000,,2131,4.449086161879896

5174419,4,B008OHV5R8,"Back in 1997, John Silveira would write a joke classified ad for Backwoods Home Magazine asking for people to accompany him to time travel.  Who knew that over a decade later, that joke would inspire a film titled ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", directed by Colin Trevorrow (""Reality Show"", ""Home Base"") and written by Derek Connolly.

Executive produced by the Duplass brothers, actor Mark (""The Puffy Chair"", ""Humpday"", ""Cyrus"") and writer Jay (""Baghead"", ""Cyrus"", ""They Puffy Chair""), the film was created with a budget of $750,000 dollars and the independent film would earn over $3 million in the box office.

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" would star Aubrey Plaza (""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"", ""Parks and Recreation"" ""Funny People""), Jake Johnson (""21 Jump Street"", ""New Girl"", ""No Strings Attached""), Karan Soni (""Worst. Prom. Ever"", ""1600 Penn""), Mary Lynn Rajskub (""24, ""Julie and Julia"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"") and Kristen Bell (""Veronica Mars"", ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", ""When in Rome"").

VIDEO:

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  While the majority of the outdoor scenes are outdoors, colors are well-saturated for those scenes, showcasing good detail.  But there are some scenes that were shot in low-light in which we see a lot of noise start to creep up.  But for the most part, picture quality for ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" looks good on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The film is primarily a dialogued-driven track, so much of the HD audio is front and center-channel driven.  There are not many scenes with crowds either, so the lossless soundtrack is appropriate for the film.  There is probably one scene in the film that involves Kenneth's creation that utilizes the surround channels but for the most part, it's a film that is primarily dialogue-driven with some scenes with music which are crystal clear!

Subtitles are in English and English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" comes with the following special features:

  A Movie Making Mission - (15:16) Interviews with the cast and crew about the film and how the film became a reality.
  The Real Ad Behind the Movie - (2:19) A short featurette of how the joke classified ad would inspire an actual film being created.

EXTRAS:

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" comes with a UltraViolet code that allows you to stream or download the film for your iOS or Android smart phone or tablet.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have learned from watching low-budget films that have some connection to the Duplass brothers, that sometimes they are able to create entertaining films with a low budget.  And with ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", working with director Colin Trevorrow and writer Derek Connolly, they were able to craft a time travel film, but not so much about the time travel but focused on character relationships.

And for a film to be based on relationships, it all comes down to the audience believing the characters.  And for ""Safety Not Guaranteed"", this is where casting really makes a big difference in the film.

Aubrey Plaza is the right person to play the disillusioned character, Darius.  And in some way, she kind of reminds me of the popular animated character ""DARIA"" (a popular animated cartoon from the '90s that was shown on MTV) in behavior and mentality, and made me wonder if Darius was inspired by the character.

But the film required for Darius to be this person that is silent and you really can't figure out because she seems like the quiet type.  So, whenever she does speak, sometimes the words that come out of her mouth is just fun and so sarcastic.  I really enjoyed watching her character.

And Mark Duplass as Kenneth.  Another character just as unpredictable as Darius.  Part of you feels that this guy is totally delusional and possibly crazy.  But there is that little part of you that hopes that maybe he has created an actual time machine.

And while the film does focus primarily on Darius and Kenneth, the writers give the audience some breathing room and introduce other relationships.  For the character of Jeff, he's a man who wants to hook up with his high school girlfriend and then you have computer nerd Arnau.  Arnau is a very nice guy, but there is no way he is ever going to get close to Darius and because of his meek character, Jeff feels so bad that he wants to get Arnau to loosen up and maybe hook him up with a woman.

So, these four characters are pretty fun to watch throughout the film.  You also get a few scenes with Mary Lynn Rajskub (from ""24) as Jeff's editor and also a brief scene with actress Kristen Bell.

As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality for this low-budget film is good, as with the lossless audio.  And there are two special features included.

Overall, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is an entertaining film because the unpredictable nature of its storyline and characters.  As the film revolves around one man wanting people to travel in time with him, the concept is so ridiculous that you feel that maybe that Kenneth is crazy.  Or is he?

""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is definitely a rare treat!  It may not be a perfect film but it's a comedy that will surely entertain you thanks to the performances by Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass and its far-out storyline.",1354320000,,5304,4.8923766816143495

5174421,5,B008OHV5R8,"After one too many special effects laden blockbusters with people I didn't care about (Prometheus) it was wonderful to find this surprise little movie.

5174422,4,B008OHV5R8,"Not surprising for a movie made by the creators of ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" this is an introspective character piece with a quirky premise.  Three jaded coworkers pursue a time-travel ad for a human interest piece and as an out-of-town vacation on their company's dime.  In different ways, they all begin to allow their walls to come down.  Aubrey Plaza's character finally allows herself to feel grief over her mother's death.  Jake M. Johnson's character works through his superficial womanizing ""cool guy"" ways in hope of something deeper.  Karan Soni's character (though criminally underused) takes a few tentative steps towards extraverted human interaction.

I didn't find this movie to be a comedy, although it had comedic moments.  Also, only an indie character study could make the suspense of ""is the time-traveler crazy, and either way, is he being followed by someone sinister or just paranoid?"" secondary to ordinary character interactions and artsy conversations punctuated with meaningful pauses and changes in cinematography.  All together, this story felt much slower and less full of adorably quirky incidents against which the characters are highlighted and fleshed out than ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" and in my opinion, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is the worse for it.

Still, the movie is engaging and worth a watch, as it showcases the facets of identity, belief, hope, and disillusionment.",1354233600,,1404,5.3744292237442925

But I took a chance on ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" based on the strength of so many positive reviews, and I'm glad I did. It's clever, light as a feather, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It never overplays its offbeat energy or devolves into cutesiness. The acting is perfectly understated and... dare I admit it?... just the right amount of amateurish for this script. I was especially surprised at how much I ended up siding with Jeff (Jake Johnson), a vain sleazebag whose brah-vado is dimming with age. His quest to carve one more notch on the bedpost of an old high-school flame takes a surprising turn. Only Arnau (Karan Soni) remains two-dimensional, although he and Jeff share the funniest (and most oddly touching) scene in the movie (""this guy crushes chicks!""). Even the live indie-folk song performance works, movie-bombing us from out of nowhere. Certain plot points will remind you of fellow quirkies ""Moonrise Kingdom"" and ""Young Adult,"" and even though it isn't quite in their league, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is considerably less precious and self-important than either of those films. If such movies usually make your eyes roll, you might still want to give this one a chance. It's offbeat, witty, atypical and subtle in all the right ways. Unlike 99% of indies, every line, scene and character has a good reason to be there. And it's genuinely funny throughout... I'm a little bummed I didn't get to see it in a theater and share all that mild, good-natured laughter. This is indie filmmaking done right.",1353974400,,1643,4.89247311827957

5174485,5,B008OHV5R8,"Excellent movie. Surprises the viewer in lots of ways. It moves effortlessly from a tongue in cheek premise, to a couple of possible love stories, to a movie about regret filled people trying to believe in other people again.

In the midst of the tumult, at the point when the viewer has probably finally accepted that he has no idea what to expect next the most cynical character (who is a reporter) is asked ""What kind of story is this?"" The cynical character replies: ""I don't really know any more."" It is my favorite moment in the movie because it is a beautiful moment when a cynic accepts a world of possibilities. But also because the viewer feels the same way. It's the moment where I stopped trying to guess and just let the rest of the movie absorb me.

This movie is about regret. ""If only I had known..."" Time travel, as a conceit, seems like it would be tailor made to erase regret. But the characters are resolved within the story, not by some magical means. And in the end, more seems possible than ever.",1353715200,,1019,4.44385026737968

While the premise of the film revolves around time travel, don't expect to be bombarded with special effects and scientific lingo. Safety Not Guaranteed is very funny at times and is extremely heartwarming.

I'm a big fan of Aubrey Plaza on ""Parks and Recreation"" and I'm happy to say that she absolutely shines here. I'm hoping this role will lead to more projects so the world can see what a terrific actress she's become. Another one of my favorite rising stars is Jake Johnson who is also great in the movie. Perhaps one of the biggest surprises here is Mark Duplass who plays the paranoid yet sweet Kenneth. The movie is very well directed and the cast is very well utilized. I highly recommend this movie.",1353283200,,812,4.71830985915493
5174528,5,B008OHV5R8,"This is a really good movie. There were a few minor things in the movie that I did not like, which I will point out later, but they were drowned in the superior light of the film as a whole, just as the stars drown in the light of the sun. The story is about a magazine writer, and two interns, who decide to write a story about an ad posted in a paper asking for a companion for a time travel expedition. The magazine writers set out to determine whether the person who posted the ad is serious, crazy, or both, although the magazine writer has an ulterior motive, and hopes to use the trip to reconnect with an old flame. It is a very unique idea for a movie and everyone involved (writer, actors, director, etc.) pull it off brilliantly.

The acting is great all around, but Mark Duplass has to be singled out as Kenneth. The role of Kenneth, I imagine, would be a difficult one to play (I am not an actor). It is to this film's credit that they have created a real character in Kenneth. He is not there just to be the constant butt of the joke. That means the actor playing him has to walk a very fine line. Even when the movie does use Kenneth for humor (like in his training sessions) they do not go ridiculously over the top with it. We believe that Kenneth believes in what he is doing, and Kenneth is aware that other people might view him as ridiculous, and is very conscious about being made fun of. Mark Duplass pulls all of this complexity off perfectly. It really is an achievement.

The movie is quite funny in places (I especially liked the robbery scene), but it also has real heart. It is, on the one hand, about depressed people. Jeff (played by Jake Johnson) is clearly going through some kind of mid-life crisis. He clearly believes that the best days of his life are already over, and tries to live vicariously through Arnau (played by Karan Soni). The Arnau story is one of the minor things I did not like in the movie. Karan Soni does a great job, and I like the character, but it is the one part of the movie that seems sort of cliche to me. The whole story line seemed too American Pie to me. There is not anything necessarily wrong with American Pie, I just do not think that that is what this movie really wants to be. It feels a little out of place. I think more could have been done with Arnau.

There is one really good moment between Jeff and Arnau, when Jeff has invited three teenagers (two girls, one guy) back to their motel room, ostensibly for Arnau's benefit, but really to try to relive his early years through Arnau. Arnau is hiding in the lobby, waiting for the three teenagers to leave, and Jeff comes and tries to convince him to return to the room. Arnau says ""Do you just want to see me get embarrassed?"". That was a good moment, in my opinion, and it would have been the perfect place for Jeff to come to a realization about what he is doing, i.e. trying to turn Arnau into someone he is not so that he can live vicariously through him. But I feel like the movie goes a more traditional route, and Jeff convinces Arnau to return to the room, and he winds up (at least) making out with one of the teenage girls. This story arc just feels a bit out of place to me. In a movie that is very original, it feels like the one part that we have seen many times before. But, like I said, it is a minor point, and the rest of the movie is so good, it does not really matter that much. Arnau is still an excellent addition to the film as a whole.

The real heart of the movie, of course, is the relationship between Darius (played by Aubrey Plaza) and Kenneth. Darius is depressed as well, or as her father says ""sad"". Her mother died some years back and she does not seem to like her job. She clearly feels alienated from the world around her, and has for a long time, as we see in the opening scene, where she is at a high school party, standing motionless, while everyone else is dancing and having a good time around her. I think, and this may just be my interpretation, that she is fed up with the cynicism around her, and is looking for some kind of innocence. Her favorite song is ""Over the Rainbow"" after all.

That is one reason this movie really spoke to me. I have recently become aware of how huge a role cynicism plays in our culture. What I mean is that jaded negativity, or critical detachment, which never commits positively to anything, but instead, stands back, and criticizes those who do commit positively to things. There are people who like things, and then there are the people who sit back and make fun of other people for liking things. I am as guilty of this, at times, as anyone else, but recently I have become aware of how much I think it controls our lives, and how destructive it can be.

One of the best scenes of the movie is when Darius and Kenneth are in the woods, and Kenneth is explaining how, when he was a kid, he used to bring his Star Wars figures with him on boy scout camping trips, because he thought they got lonely at home without him, and how some of the other cynical kids made fun of him for it. That is a perfect example of what I am talking about. Kenneth's sensitivity is a good quality, the kind of quality we should be nurturing in children, and yet children seem to have an almost instinctive determination to squash that kind of thing (and it is not just children). I do not understand that. That is one of the mysteries of human life to me, that we are often taught to be ashamed of our best qualities, and it is a question that this movie explores in detail. In a way the whole movie is about that kind of cynicism, since Kenneth is committed to something that he truly believes in (time travel) and the magazine writers are essentially there to make fun of him for believing in it. I think Darius recognizes in Kenneth someone who is free from the cynicism of the society around her. I think we all want that, because I think we are suffocating under this cynicism, which is why I think the themes of this film are so universal, and seem to speak to so many people. It is exhausting to be so jaded all the time.

There is another brilliant part in the movie. It comes at the very end. I do not think I will be giving anything important away by describing it, but just in case, I will give my SPOILER ALERT. Kenneth has Darius record him talking to a camera about their planned trip through time. At the end of the movie some excerpts from those tapes are played, and Kenneth gives a brilliant little speech about the relative pros and cons of the single life versus committed relationships (he is actually talking about why he chose to have a partner on his time travel trip but it works perfectly as a metaphor). I have decided to quote the speech in full since I think it is a good speech. Kenneth says: ""To go it alone, or to go with a partner. When you choose a partner you have to have compromises, sacrifices, but its the price you pay. Do I want to follow my every whim and desire as I make my way through time and space? Absolutely. But at the end of the day, do I need someone when I am doubting myself, and I'm insecure, and my heart's failing me? Do I need someone, who when the heat gets hot, has my back?"" Then Darius asks, ""So, do you?"" And Kenneth replies, ""I do"". Kenneth is talking about his trip back in time, but it would be hard to imagine a better synopsis of the pros and cons of relationships (and is it a coincidence that the last line of the movie is ""I do""?). This is really good writing, in my opinion. The kind of writing we rarely see in movies.

Now I really need to give my SPOILER ALERT since I am about to give away the ending. In the end it turns out the time machine is real. I read some reviews that claim the ending was ambiguous. To me the ending does not seem all that ambiguous. The time machine disappears into thin air, and I am not sure how else to explain that, other than to assume that they really did travel back in time. At first, I did not like that the time machine turned out to be real. I wanted it to be more ambiguous than it was, but as I reflected on it, I changed my mind, precisely because of the cynicism theme. I looked up cynicism on Wikipedia and this is the definition Wikipedia gave ""a general lack of faith or hope in the human race or in individuals with desires hopes, opinions, or personal tastes that a cynic perceives as unrealistic or inappropriate, therefore deserving of ridicule or admonishment."" I think it is important, therefore, that the cynic turn out to be wrong at the end of this movie, and that means that the time machine has to be real. The believer has to turn out to be right. Ultimately, if it turned out that Kenneth was just crazy, then the message of the movie would have been very different. I think I disliked the ending at first because actual time travel feels somewhat out of place in a realistic movie like this, but I think it serves an artistic purpose. It sends the message that the world belongs to the innocent, the sensitive, and the sincere, and not to the cynic.",1353283200,4,9063,4.243775332947307

SPOILER ALERT - Kenneth runs his car into a guy's house who's girlfriend he has a crush on.  So, basically, he tried to injure or even kill them, because he liked her.  He later claims that she was his girlfriend who was killed by some lunatic who ran his car into her house and that he has to go back in time to save her.  Somehow that's irrelevant if he is actually building a time machine and not just ""crazy"".  Already way crazy on the first count.  I didn't find the storylines created for Darius' coworkers particularly touching, either.",1353196800,2,766,4.786259541984733
5174532,5,B008OHV5R8,"There are indie films that could have been brilliant if they weren't too in love with themselves to shine (I think of Your Sister's Sister) and then are the independent films that get everything right: story, pacing, character development, mystery.

Darius (Plaza) is an intern for Seattle magazine. She is indifferent to life's excesses and stupidities and feels out of place and time. When Jeff (Johnson) needs two interns to help investigate a story about a man in need of a time traveling partner - a classified ad appearing in a local newspaper - she volunteers along with Arnau (Soni). From there, the trio drive off in Jeff's Escalade to Ocean View, a sleepy town on the Pacific coast.

In Ocean View, they stake out the post office to find out who the time traveler is. Well, it's Kenneth (Duplass) who is quirky and serious, someone you are never quite sure of until the film's end. Jeff tries to get to know Kenneth first but the latter isn't impressed with the pompous writer. It's Darius who gets the green light and finds herself getting caught up and confused in Kenneth's world.

What makes this film wonderful is the chemistry. I think of the line: Everything in its place and a place for everything. This platitude applies here. While Darius and Kenneth become closer, Jeff and Arnau share a kind of surprising, quasi-mentor-prodigy bond. Jeff's main concern isn't so much the story about the time traveler but hooking up with a former sweetheart in Ocean View and in his search, discovers more than he intended to find. He tries to impart some wisdom on Arnau about life and women. In some films Jeff would be written off as the hot shot but he's got wounded layers along with Arnau. No one here is one-dimensional.

No one character carries the film but I'll admit, Aubrey Plaza is easy on the eyes and her character will appeal to anyone who feels out of place in life. Her portrayal of Darius is very human and she bring warmth, compassion and composure to a role that could have been handled differently in Hollywood-backed hands. Let's hope Plaza, as her career unfolds, doesn't become a satire of herself like Zoey Deschanel.

Mark Duplass is also equally excellent. He brings gravity and realism to his role. And what's great, he keeps the mystery alive. As a viewer, you're never quite sure if he's built a time machine or not. The ending is definitely rewarding.

One thing I will close with is that it must have been a lot of fun making this film. There's nothing lacking here.",1353196800,,2505,4.681818181818182

Films like Battleship deserve to play in limited locations for their utter stupidity but films like Safety Not Guaranteed serve to be shown everywhere, for it is really that great. Aubrey Plaza does a great job but even more fantastic is Mark Duplass, playing the man who wants to time travel.
I normally don't write reviews but this film struck me as beautiful. The time-travel factor may make someone think that this film will be stupid but it contains so much more than time-travel. It is about friendship, mourning, and finding solace in something that haunts you. Time travel is that solace for Kenneth, the main who wants to time travel, because it's the only hope he has left at redoing something he regrets from the past.

It reminds me of the best of the movies I used to discover in the days I spent attending films at art house theaters before the internet age.  Thankfully, I can now find this kind of treasure on my computer devices and watch it at home.

This is set on the Pacific coast of Washington State.  A reporter and two interns from SEATTLE MAGAZINE are sent there on assignment to investigate a guy who placed a personal ad with it looking for a time travel companion whose safety he cannot guarantee and who better bring some weapons along. The person interviewing for this position becomes the female magazine intern.

The key here is the hero who really grows on you.  At first he strikes you as a nerd but this does not last. And throughout the question looms, is he for real about this time travel where he can't guarantee your safety? The answer to this is absolutely brilliant.

Here's the scoop. A trendy magazine comes across a possible story about a guy looking for a companion to travel with him back in time. The editor assigns one of the writers who picks two interns to investigate. They find out a lot about their time traveler but also a lot about themselves.

A lot of people liked this movie a lot. I liked it enough but I kept seeing how good......no, great it could have been. It's an indy film through and through. There are limited sets and frou frou. It's mostly writing and acting, and it was all just Okay. This was the frustrating part. The script was well measured but lacked something. It needed a more powerful climax. The directing, likewise, was efficient but needed more umph. I liked the soundtrack quite a bit. There were a lot of nifty indy tunes that were well matched with the action. I liked the characters and the actors that played them, but it all seemed to fall short.

This is a decent watch. I just kept seeing the possibilities. If you're at all into this sort of thing it's well worth your time to view it. Just don't expect too much.",1352764800,,1347,4.423387096774194
5174564,4,B008OHV5R8,"According to Joseph Campbell, movies inspired by myths and fairy tales (Odyssey, Hidden Fortress, The Wizard of Oz, etc) can also be viewed as metaphors for the inner journey of self discovery and understanding and if that's the case, perhaps this is a film which can be viewed as a metaphor for preparing to take such journey. The Protagonist once tried ""going back in time"" (ie: review his past) and realized that it was a task that needed more preparation.  Before going again, he decides to do more research, obtain some self protective skills and advertise for a companion, someone who will be there and still be accepting when he reaches his vulnerable spots.  ""Grief is healed when it is witnessed by a caring other.""

The protagonist is an intelligent middle-aged man who might be punishing himself by limiting himself to a job in a grocery store because he feels guilty and responsible over his mother's early passing.  He clouds it by saying that he is responsible for the death of his former girlfriend even though she lives nearby and has a happy life.  Facing hidden guilt and fears is not an easy thing to do.  Safety is not guaranteed.  The suspense in this movie is wondering whether or not he'll actually begin the journey.  Marie-Louise Von Franz says that oceans and forests are symbols of the unconscious and in the final scene, we can see our hero and his companion running freely in a forest implying that he's off to a good start and more prepared this time around.  I also enjoyed this light-hearted comedy with a bit of mystery and suspense filmed in the Seattle area.",1352678400,,1593,4.701438848920863

What's it about?
Three magazine employees head out on an assignment to interview a
guy who placed a classified ad seeking a companion for time travel.

What did I think?
Have you ever gone to eat dinner at a restaurant just because you
love the deserts?  This movie had those qualities.  It was a funny
independant comedy, but there were parts where I was just hoping to
just skip to desert.  The ending is pure cheesecake, but you have to
eat an overpriced burger to get there.  It's worth going for the
desert once, then you decide if it's worth owning and you can keep
going back.",1352678400,,737,4.6953125

A journalist and two interns are sent to a small shore town to look for the poster of a rather cryptic ad about time travel. All three are closed in their own ways. The journalist is looking to light a spark with an old high school girlfriend, one of the interns spends all of his time with his computer out of fear and Darius, our main protagonist never really interacts on a deep level with anyone. Kenneth, who posted the ad, is looking for a partner to time travel with and in Darius he finds the ideal companion.
I can't say enough about how wonderfully this movie is acted and how fresh the characters are. The direction, music and cinemetography are also spot on, absolutely in tune with this sweet little story. I highly recommend it.

5174572,4,B008OHV5R8,"""There's no time like the present to think about the past"" might be a theme in this film.  Even though ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" is supposedly about time travel, the present is the most important time in the character's lives.  ""Time"" itself might even be a character in the film.

I used to live in Seattle, so I wanted to see some of the old sites.  But in reality, most of this film is set in Ocean View, a town that I don't believe I've ever been.  Fair enough.  There was some sunshine in Ocean View, something that you won't see much of in Seattle.  (OK.  Seattle supposedly had a very dry summer this year - 2012 - but that is an anomoly.  It stops raining usually after July 4th, and starts again Labor Day.  Almost every year.  You may count on that again in 2013.)

This film reminds me alot of ""Sideways"":  flawed characters, quirky, a road trip, and very funny.  VERY funny.  I laughed most of the time, which I believe was the intent of the writer and director.  There is a lot of slightly innapropriate dialog from characters - not offensive, but just unexpected - which will make you laugh.  Example:  ""I want to make you a homemade dinner.""  ""I want to eat that homemade dinner.""  And the actors are almost pitch perfect here, in particular Aubrey Plaza.  Her deadpan act is awesome.

The only thing that was extremely annoying to me is the fact that this is one of those movies that the volume constantly changes from very low level of sound, then a musical interlude that switches to extremely high volume levels. I was constantly having to turn the volume on my surround up/down as I find it annoying when the volume level of a movie goes from 1 to 20 on a scale in matter of seconds then back down.

5174668,5,B008OHV5R8,"This is a little movie that surprised the heck out of me.  It is a movie that you can't put firmly into any one genre as it drifts from drama to romantic comedy to sci-fi.  I gave it a try because I'm a fan of Jake Johnson (of the TV series ""New Girl"") and Aubrey Plaza (of the TV series ""Parks and Recreation"") and was very happy that I did.

The movie begins at a Seattle magazine where the boss, played by Mary Lynn Rajskub (who you may remember as Chloe from the ""24"" television series) is looking for story ideas.  Jake Johnson's character Jeff suggests investigating a bizarre classified ad that reads:

""Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed.""

The story idea is a winner and so begins the road trip taken by Jeff, Darius (played by Plaza) and intern Arnau (played brilliantly by Karan Soni) to investigate.  They discover the man that placed the ad, Kenneth (played by Mark Duplass) and after Jeff fails to get close to him it is up to Darius to win his trust in order to join him on his quest.

I think the beauty of this movie is that the three characters sent to investigate this ""time traveler"" are all on different tracks in their lives as far as time goes.  Jeff, it turns out, suggested the story because his first girlfriend from high school lives in the same small town where the ad originated.  He's trying to recapture the past just like Kenneth.  Darius is suspended in time, not happy with her job, not wanting to date because she's unsure of herself so it's like her life isn't moving at all.  Arnau is the intern who's life is zooming forward, he just took the magazine internship because it looks good on his resume and he's rushing through school and not having any fun at all.

They're all on a journey, and I found it to be a very fun movie to watch and be swept away in.  It shows that you don't need a huge budget (this was made for about $750,000) to create a good film.  I'd highly recommend it.",1351641600,,2074,4.295629820051414

The movie is quirky enough for the non-""main stream"" crowd to really get into. The acting and plot are enough to carry this movie and little by little you find yourself rooting for the ""crazy"" guy and really hope he can do what he says. So many movies like this start off so good and become way too cheesy by the end that it ends up ruining the movie. This is the exception to that rule and the ending is perfect and ends in about the only way that I think it could have. When you watch you may have a different opinion but I think it was a perfect ending to this movie. Overall, if you a looking for a fun movie that is different then most of the offerings out there then this is a very good choice.

In truth, Jeff really just wants to visit the area of the ad writer for personal reasons and to shirk his job - so he takes two young interns with him, Darius (Aubrey Plaza of NBC's Parks and Recreation) and Arnau (Karan Soni), who wind up doing all the work and investigating the story.

Turns out, the writer of the newspaper ad, Kenneth (Mark Duplass) is working in a local grocery store and lives in a cabin in the woods. He's an oddball character, and you'll wonder whether he is a quiet genius or simply a nut case. Because Darius (Plaza) is assigned to 'get close to him', we see some really nice interaction between the characters and what could be a budding romance. Soni and Johnson provide most of the comedy, with Johnson slowly maturing a bit and becoming less than a one dimensional character.

I won't divulge anything about the ending or key plot points, because it's better to enjoy them in the film. I had the privilege of seeing a special screening of Safety Not Guaranteed that was attended by Aubrey Plaza, and was able to meet her. Had it not been for that opportunity, I probably would not have seen the film, since it played in such limited release.

I highly recommend this brilliant little indie film that combines good writing, good directing, captivating plot, and great casting and acting. Keep your eyes on this cast - they will soon be much bigger names.",1349395200,7,1999,4.6543909348441925

Like I said, I had high expectations going into the movie because I am a big Aubrey Plaza fan and had heard many good things about the movie already.  What separates this movie from the herd is that it lived up to the hype and then some.  The script is wonderful, charming, poignant, and creative in all the right places.  At the end of the showing in my theater everyone gave it a standing ovation.  This film honestly blew me away, and it deserves at the very least a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars.  If you were unsure of watching this movie, don't hesitate.  You will love it.",1348099200,2,692,4.4015748031496065
5174690,5,B008OHV5R8,"Truly one of my NEW Favorite movies. I CANNOT WAIT for this to come out on BluRay. I went in with no expectations and walked out floored. Great cast, pathos, ethos and story that grabbed me from the first scene and held me to the end. Left me totally satisfied and as much as I want to know where the story goes next I pray there is NO sequel and that my imagination can take me to 100 different possibilites.

Great for a Date Movie, Sci-Fi fans & More.

5174691,5,B008OHV5R8,"It is such a good movie! I almost cried a few times, and it has a surprising and satisfying ending. It has mystery, suspense, love, deceit, and it is hilarious.",1347580800,,160,4.366666666666666
5174692,5,B008OHV5R8,"This is a great gem of a movie that has all the tell tale markings of a sleeper hit. I have to say this film made me realize how jaded I've grown toward independent films. Having seen the trailer, I expected to be entertained and enjoy the film, but I was sure that I was beyond its warm and fuzzy sentiments - I never expected to fall so hard for this movie.

It was absolutely lovely to watch a film that both my teenage son and I could enjoy that has great characters, plot, dialogue and direction. Not to mention heart, warmth, and a refreshing lack of violence and nudity. The film walks a fine line, yet never falls into the realm of the sappy, clich, or bland family film. This is the kind of film that shows you how delightful it is to be surprised and charmed by everyday reality.

Highly Recommended!",1347408000,68,810,4.287581699346405
5174693,5,B008OHV5R8,"An ad appears in the paper:

""Wanted: Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. I have only done this once before. Safety not guaranteed.""

Jeff (Jake Johnson from ""New Girl""), an assistant editor for a magazine  convinces his editor to let him and his two interns Arnau and Darius (Aubrey Plaza from ""Parks and Recreation"") try and find the person who placed the ad as there might be something there about which an article can be written.  She agrees.

It turns out he has an ulterior motive, his old girl friend lives there and he wants to see if you can go home again.  One of many subplots, this adds depth but is not the main focus of the film.  They find the author of the ad, but he spots the assistant editor as a ringer right away.  They then send in the incredibly withdrawn intern Darius and in an unconventional way, they bond.

Although the question of whether or not he can build a time machine is answered, I'm not going to reveal that here.  That's OK; you see, It Doesn't Matter.  This is not a movie about time travel.  It's about what happens to all these people in the process of finding out.

I can't say enough good about this film.  Well acted, well directed, good story, the whole thing.  I can say that almost everyone will be thoroughly delighted.  Sometimes hilarious, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes joyful, sometimes philosophical, always charmingly offbeat, this movie is a unique treasure.

I also can't say enough about what a pleasant surprise this movie is.  It grossed less than $4 million so far, it's not the ""Dark Knight"" after all, so there is a whole world out there that hasn't yet experienced this gem.  Become one of them.  This is HIGHLY recommended.

A recommendation:  Get the DVD vs. the Blu-Ray.  This is a small indie film, and neither the video nor the audio are going to benefit that much from Blu-Ray.  So, as long as they do a decent DVD transfer (and if they don't it's unlikely they'd be able to afford to do so on the Blu-Ray), I wouldn't endorse the 25% surcharge for Blu, especially given how well players upscale DVDs.",1347321600,11,2157,4.5
5174694,5,B008OHV5R8,"I went to a local indie movie house on a Saturday afternoon because it was hot as Hades and the theater, unlike my home, was air conditioned. I vaguely remembered the title and premise of the movie from Sundance, where it did well. I was pulled in immediately, laughed out loud at several scenes and fell for these quirky, slightly flawed characters. The movie is never pretentious about its independent roots. The acting is superb and the time travel element, while a definite part of the story, becomes secondary in importance to your feelings for the characters.

Can't wait to own the DVD so I can watch it again and again!",1344902400,11,627,4.648648648648648
5174695,5,B008OHV5R8,"Safety Not Guaranteed is a quirky love story that sucks you in the second it starts.

The story is about a team of 3 journalists (Aubrey Plaza, Jake M. Johnson, and Karan Soni) who decide to write a story about a man who is seeking someone to travel with him back in time. He doesn't say where he's going or why, but the ad he writes is interesting enough for the story. Besides a wonderful subplot, thats basically the story. Its funny, cute, and above all else brutally honest. Our three journalists are all in someways emotionally damaged or emotionally distant, and watching these characters grow is a wonderful and move beyond their troubles is pure joy. Mark Duplass as Kenneth, the one who wrote the ad, is fantastic. He does such a good job with the character that about halfway through the movie, you begin to question if he really does know how to travel back in time or not. Aubrey Plaza as the one who gets close to him also does a great job, a character worth rooting for and one that by the end may have you holding back a few tears. Karan Soni plays the lovable geek while Jake Johnson has a subplot involving a past lover that is as heart wrenching as it is funny.

This movie is so beautifully simple that I can't recommend it enough. The performances are great, the music is wonderful, and the story is all being told in front of a beautiful backdrop (mostly filmed in or around Seattle).
