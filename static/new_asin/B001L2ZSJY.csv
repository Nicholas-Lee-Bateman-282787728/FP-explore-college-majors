3677957,4,B001L2ZSJY,This movie shows the influence James Brown had on a people...and how one man squash a potential riot.  And a must see performance!,1366329600,,130,4.6521739130434785
3677958,3,B001L2ZSJY,"I'm sure James Brown's performance helped the tense situation but too much time was spent on glorifying his role. My interest was in his performance. The film devoted to the actual performance was 5 stars, the rest only 2 stars at best.",1364688000,,236,4.642857142857143
3677959,5,B001L2ZSJY,"I was pleasantly surprised about all the positive aspects of this production.  It goes far beyond documentary style reporting to tell an eloquent story about leadership and will always remain relevant.  I recommend its viewing to all ages and backgrounds, including those with an interest in history, business, leadership and, of, great music.",1364515200,,343,5.452830188679245

3677961,5,B001L2ZSJY,"Anyone ever notice that it is always the voices that preach peace, love, progress, and equality that are cut down by an assassin's bullet? This quite excellent film is a great demonstration and examination of race relations in the northern states during the 60's. The Civil Rights Movement was on balance a success in that equality amongst races in the US (at least in the eyes of the law) was ensured and secured by legislation and judicial decisions.  With that said, we have to ask ourselves, at what cost?
The country lost a generation of dynamic, intelligent, and inspirational leaders by violent insidious actions.  What help could/would they all have been in the class war that commenced a decade or so later? I digress...
The film, should have been called ""Mayor White's Courageous Act: How PBS and James Brown soothed Boston after tragic day"" or something to that effect... That said, the working title probably made it a bit easier to raise funds for the film. In any case, it offers great insight in to the ""enlightened north"" during the civil rights movement, and explains that although big cities and northern states were more progressive that the downright backward ex-confederacy, not all was well in terms of race relations. Even in Cosmopolitan Boston, white apprehension and prejudice was alive and well in a good portion of the population.  Thank goodness those bloody backward times are in the past...
Now all we need is to find Class Warriors like the murdered civil rights advocates of days past that will fight fiscal inequality like MLK, RFK, Malcom X etc. fought racial inequality...",1355011200,,1608,4.948148148148148
3677962,5,B001L2ZSJY,I was very impressed with this documentary. I highly recommend.  Very insightful.  I was inspired by it and I hope that everyone can see this.  In my opinion it is a great piece of American history.,1329004800,,198,4.444444444444445
3677963,5,B001L2ZSJY,"This is a thorough documentary film about James Brown's influence and personal position on the civil rights movement in the fragile moments after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in April, 1968. The film chronicles the extremely tense racial atmosphere in the United States in general, and in Boston in particular, following King's murder via interviews with Boston's mayor at the time, a former city councilman, Brown's former business manager and two of his band members. Also, there is footage of James Brown providing his own commentary on the necessity black unity.  Dr. Cornell West and Rev. Al Sharpton provide some good commentary on James Brown's strong character and courage during this racial powder keg. The film provides awesome footage of classic JB stage showmanship. This is a must see film and a must have addition to your library for its entertainment value, but more importantly, as an educational film that showcases a critical period in the United State's democracy experience.",1318032000,,1022,5.193939393939394
3677964,5,B001L2ZSJY,"Though footage of the legendary concert (mostly copies of copies of copies) have been floating around for ages, it is only recently that its been commercially released.

The back drop:  1968, the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King...
Countless American Cities are burning...
The question:  How can the powers that be get as many people as possible to stay home and possibly pass up on the big riot?

The answer:  James Brown, the hottest performer in show business to cool down one of the most explosive situations in the city's history...  So public TV station WGBH decides to televise a special concert at the Boston Garden asking everyone to stay home...

This documentary features talking heads such as Rev. Al Sharpton, Dr. Cornel West, Rep. Alan Young, legendary Boston DJ James ""Early"" Byrd, the Mayor of Boston (at the time) and plenty of footage of JB from the era when he was busting out dance moves that literally seemed to defy the laws of gravity (I'm not joking...)  Also includes intersting JB footage... and interesting commentary (especially by Rev. Al Sharpton and JB manager Charles Bobbitt on how JB didn't necessarily agree with all of MLK's ideas about pacifism and the Viet Naam war, but how he respected him greatly...  It also includes some incredible behind the scenes commentary...

Though I've seen a lot of the footage together, the documentary still is incredibly insightful and a great companion to the actual performance - - really though, it should have been issued as a companion to the documentary, not a separate purchase...  That said, beyond the concert, the documentary discusses the politicization of James Brown, from his concept and practice of black entrepreneurialism, endorsement of Hubert Humphrey and Bobby Kennedy, his trip to Viet Naam, the recording of SAY IT LOUD, I'M BLACK AND I'M PROUD and his controversial endorsement of Richard Nixon and more.

Also includes brief commentary by Fred Wesley,  Marva Whitney, Jabo Starks - - The only criticism that can be made is that to an extent, the film is JBE propaganda... No doubt, the man was larger than life, and although the film mentions that some of his actions did anger many portions of the black community in that era, no representatives of that point of view appear in the documentary... considering that the copy-write to the film is held as ""The James Brown Estate"" this is not exactly surprising - - Fred Wesley's appearance is also interesting after the publication of his own auto-biography which paints a far less than flattering picture of JB...&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hit-Me-Fred-Recollections-of-a-Sideman/dp/0822335484/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hit Me, Fred: Recollections of a Sideman</a>&nbsp;That said, JB indeed was larger than life, and so too was his music.

P.S.  Ending moments capture a great Jabo Starks drum solo with great film work ! ! !",1254441600,7,2925,5.233404710920771
3677965,5,B001L2ZSJY,"April 5, 1968. Martin Luther King assasinated the day before. Riots in over 100 American cities. Scheduled for a concert in Boston Garden that night: James Brown. Should the concert be held? Would anyone show up? What if we televise it? Can we? Would Mr. Brown allow it? Will any station broadcast it?
This film documents the times leading up to the events of April 5th, and the things that happened afterwards. Throughout this remarkable film is the music and the presence of James Brown, Soul Brother #1.
If you want music, there's a lot here. If you want history, there's a lot here. This is an amazing film that Everyone should see at least once in their lives.",1242432000,5,665,4.5966386554621845
3677966,4,B001L2ZSJY,"Interesting documentary about the true story of the nights following Martin Luther King's assassination, where many of the cities in America were in turmoil with riots and looting. But in Boston, things were quiet, in large part due to Mayor Kevin White's decision to broadcast James Brown's show at the Garden live on PBS that night. Some cynics say it was just to keep the black residents away from the white area of North Station, and that might be partly true, but I think for the most part the intentions were good (and it worked). Good documentary pointing out everything from how James insisted on reimbursement ($50k) to the fact that PBS had never done a live rock band before, and wasn't even sure how to mic and mix it!",1241136000,3,730,4.623076923076923

8317061,5,B001L2ZSJY,James Brown played an important role in cooling the race riots after MLK was assassinated. This documentary told the story of the power of music to bring people together.  Brown did not agree with the pacifist philosophy but he loved and respected the man who so passionately promoted peaceful integration. This was a history lesson with a good beat and you can dance to it.,1366848000,,374,4.753846153846154
