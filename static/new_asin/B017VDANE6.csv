Spoilers

1.[US TITLE][ 2/3 FALLS MATCH]KALISTO VS ALBERTO DEL RIO-excellent opening match that not only was two great wrestlers going at it but it was also for a title. I cant believe that this match was on the pre show as it was most definitely worthy on main card status. Things start fast as both men go right into it with Del Rio working over Kalisto. The Lucha Dragon fights back hard with his high flying style, so much so that Del Rio uses a chair on the outside getting disqualified. That put Kalisto up one but it wouldnt be long before Del Rio evened the odds after a devastating looking double stomp off of the ropes. The third fall would come much later as the longest part of the match, at least for Kalisto as he is dominated for the majority of it. Still the little man with the big heart keeps his belt after a well timed roll up. Excellent opening match that should have been on the main card.

2. SASHA BANKS & BECKY LYNCH VS TAMINA SNUKA & NAOMI-main card opens with this Womens tag match. This was a good tag match with all four looking good. Lynch and Banks of course were not on the same page for a good portion of the match. As the match goes on though they find a way to come together and also get the win. This was a good match between these ladies.

3.[I-C TITLE]KEVIN OWENS VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-Ziggler was getting a shot at the title in his home town after beating Owens twice leading up to this night. This was a great match that the fans were really into. Great back and forth battle that showcased both of these warriors skills from beginning to end. Ziggler of course was a favorite going in winning previous matches and being in his home town. But Ownes was not to be defeated on this night, great match.

4. THE WYATT FAMILY VS KANE, BIG SHOW & RYBACK-this was a good match between these six huge guys. This was a good power against power matchup that would see for the most part Show, Back, and Kane dominating. I am not sure why the WWE never really has The Wyatts go over. They are one of the most entertaining groups they have, especially Bray. Anyway this was a fun match for the middle of the card.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]CHARLOTTE VS BRIE BELLA-this match would see Brie trying to take the title from the woman who took it from her sister. Of course Charlotte had her father at ringside which always plays into it. This was a good match especially for Brie who looked better here than she had in a while. Good back and forth with the emotional favorite Brie looking lime she might take it. Still in the end Charlotte makes Brie tap with a figure eight.

6. CHRIS JERICHO VS AJ STYLES-this was probably my favorite match of the night. Two of my all time favorite guys go at it in this rubber match. AJ had defeated Y2J on Raw only for Jericho to avenge that loss on Smackdown. That of course set up this third match to see who the best was. The match is a back and forth war with each many countering many of the others signature moves. Both men looked outstanding here but Jericho would falter tapping out giving Styles the victory, they would shake hands after which would end up continuing the storyline between them.

It is at this moment that we get Edge Christians Cutting Edge Peep Show for an interview with The New Day. Of course with all of these guys it is very funny and entertaining. Then The League of Nations comes out only to be dissed by all five guys. Good little segment.

7. CURTIS AXEL VS R-TRUTH-this was a quick and very short match that was still entertaining. Sure it should have been on the kickoff show and the US title match should have been here but whatever. Either way this was a fun little quick one with Truth looking good until Goldust costs him the match accidently.

8.[#1 CONTENDERS MATCH]BROCK LESNAR VS DEAN AMBROSE VS ROMAN REIGNS-the main event was to see who would go on to face Triple H at Wrestlemania for the title. This was a hard hitting match with all three competitors going at it with friendships set aside. Ambrose and Reigns to team to take on Brock but every time he is out of the picture they go at each other tooth and nail. There are many great moments here involving the announcers table and am excellent suplex. This was a really fun match that may have been the best on the card. Reigns of course wins but we all knew that was going to happen.

This was a really good event that a real fun vibe to it. Of course it was the last PPV before Mania so it was most likely going to be good. I would recommend this DVD to any wrestling fan out there.",1461801600,,4551,4.311111111111111

8740807,3,B017VDANE6,"The Sasha Banks & Becky Lynch vs. Naomi & Tamina tag team match was a solid match with an easy to follow story and a satisfying ending that was predictable. The match was a bit longer than I expected. I feel like they could have shaved off a few minutes and it would have helped them. There were a few minutes in there with the heels on offense that were really boring. The ending was really well done, though. This result should set up Lynch and Banks as the contenders for the Divas Title at WrestleMania. A triple threat is likely there. The Intercontinental Title match between Kevin Owens vs. Dolph Ziggler was no surprise that they had a great match when they got over 10 minutes in the ring. Thats their third awesome matchup in the last month and this was better than the other two. Ziggler did a great job of fighting back from Owens power offense and he got a lot of believable offense in there. The crowd hasn't been hot the whole night, but they certainly made a lot of noise by the end. Owens is outstanding as a bullying type heel against a smaller wrestler. Owens winning made sense because he just won it back last Monday. As Ive written for weeks now, my hope is that Owens faces AJ Styles at WrestleMania. I have no idea if thats going to happen, but I think it would be an outstanding match. Owens has been tweeting about #KOMania for weeks and the announcers put it over too. I hope he gets a singles match at the biggest show of the year. He deserves the spotlight. Zigglers been in WWE for about ten years and deserves it too, but he probably won't get a singles match at WrestleMania. The Big Show, Ryback & Kane vs. Erick Rowan, Luke Harper & Braun Strowman-6 man tag team match was a yawner. It was a decent match with a bunch of power spots. At least the finish was pretty good. Im surprised by the result because I figured the heels needed the win a lot more. Arent they trying to put over the Wyatt Family as this unbeatable group? They just lost to a bunch of midcarders teaming for the first time that have lost more matches in the last six months than theyve won. Isnt Wyatt going to be pushed against Brock Lesnar? Apparently not. I just don't get the booking decision at all. Perhaps it will make sense in time, but right now Im confused by it. The Divas Title match between Charlotte vs. Brie Bella was a lengthy match with a good effort by both women. There were some believable nearfalls by Brie as well as the near submission spots. I thought the first half of the match was just too slow. It was as if they didn't know how to get to the 13-minute mark without it. Thats partly a Brie thing because shes never been that great in the longer matches. Charlottes more capable. Im not saying Brie is bad because I appreciated the effort. I just think Charlottes on another level. It was the right call to keep the title on Charlotte. As for the future, this likely sets up a WrestleMania triple threat for the Divas Title with Charlotte against Sasha and Becky. That will be awesome. The AJ Styles vs. Chris Jericho match was another excellent match in this series that theyve had. They really booked it evenly from start to finish because they each had the advantage for brief periods of time. Its not like one guy dominated for several minutes. There were nearfalls for each of them. I liked the way they executed the last few minutes. Jericho was able to hit the Codebreaker yet he wasn't able to get the win with it. When Styles hit the Styles Clash he didn't win, which was a very believable nearfall. Styles getting the win with the Calf Crusher was a smart way to end it because they need to build it up as a credible submission. Im a little surprised that the Styles Clash didn't end it, but thats okay. Hell win other matches with it. The important thing is the new guy Styles got the win as he should have. The R-Truth vs. Curtis Axel match was just a filler bout and that's that. The Number One Contenders Match for the WWE Title: Dean Ambrose vs. Roman Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar  was a great triple threat match full of some memorable high spots, big moments for all three guys and a finish that was predictable even though Im sure some people were angry about it. Would it have been better to have Ambrose win? Yeah, but I didn't expect it. I liked the way Lesnar was booked in the match with him dominating early on, then the other two had to work together to put him through the tables twice to stop him and he came back to dominate again. That spot where he did a German Suplex while Reigns had Ambrose up for a Samoan Drop was pretty cool. The match actually reminded me of the Lesnar/Rollins/Cena match from Royal Rumble 2015 (my match of the year) although it was a notch below that. The only thing I really didn't like is that Ambrose nailed Reigns with a few chair shots to the back, Reigns sold it for about five seconds before coming back with a Spear and the win. It just felt like it was too soon. It makes Reigns look like too much of a Superman. Ambrose did a great job all match. Im not sure who he or Lesnar will face at WrestleMania. Maybe they face eachother? Since there was no Wyatt Family interference they might end up doing that. Im not really sure. Overall, I enjoyed this match a lot. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1456617600,3,5284,4.315895372233401
8740808,4,B017VDANE6,"Sasha Banks & Becky Lynch vs. Naomi & Tamina - Team B.A.D. was able to take advantage of miscommunication between their opponents early on before they were able to get on the same page as B.A.D. was able to keep the momentum using tactics to single out & isolate one opponent away from her partner while Banks & Lynch were able to get on the same page relying on various double teaming & dual offense on their opponents including one finding unique ways to keep using her knees to attack her opponents in a solid tag match.

Intercontinental Champion Kevin Owens vs Dolph Ziggler - Dolph was in his hometown of Cleveland with Owens taking a cheap shot before working him over keeping him grounded while Dolph attempted to pick up the pace with some big moves & repeated elbow drops as they traded momentum with both men taking advantage of the mistiming of their opponents & having moments of being a ""show off"" while executing their trademark & impactful offense including executing similar moves against each other while also having counters for their opponent's in a back & forth match.

Big Show, Kane, Ryback vs. The Wyatt Family (Luke Harper, Erick Rowan, Brawn Stroman) - Bray Wyatt sat at ringside (in Byron Saxton's chair) as Show & Kane & Ryback were dominate early playing to their individual strengths including overpowering them in ways I don't recall seeing before & Ryback using some new offense while the Wyatts attempted to use the ""divide & conquer"" strategy of isolating a member of the team in their half of the ring using offense to neutralize their opponent's power in a nice match that was better than expected.

Divas Champion Charlotte vs. Brie Bella - Brie was out for revenge for the woman who ended her sister Nikki's record setting title reign & wearing her husband Daniel Bryan's kickpads from WrestleMania 30 while Ric Flair was in his daughter's corner.  Charlotte mocked Bryan early on with her own ""Yes"" chants causing Brie to not only work over a specific area of the body but also return to taunt to not only Charlotte but Ric on the outside while using offense from her husband & sister while Charlotte was able to use her powerful legs to her advantage in different ways & still taunt Brie as they traded momentum only for Brie to come back delivering various dropkicks & submissions from different positions.  This was definitely the best singles performance I can ever remember seeing from Brie Bella in a solid match.

A.J. Styles vs. Chris Jericho - The third match in their trilogy over the previous month they were evenly matched in the early moments before Jericho was able to get the advantage with the match briefly going to the outside & going aerial various times including catching & countering A.J. in mid-air on more than one occasion while Styles had his own counters to some of Jericho's trademark offense along with delivering some unique ones of his own as they continued to trade momentum throughout the contest with more innovative counters & submission attempts in a really good competitive match.

Right around here was Edge & Christian's return (complete with ring announcer Tony Chimmel returning just to do Edge's classic introduction) for the ""Cutting Edge Peep Show"" with New Day that eventually led to a confrontation with the League Of Nations in a segment that had it's moments of entertaining back & forth talking but reminded me of WrestleMania V's Piper's Pit where it went on too long for my taste & could have been better placed on the pre-show.

R-Truth vs. Curtis Axel - This was a quick match that was under 2 minutes with it's only purpose being to further the story between Goldust attempting to be Truth's partner only for it to once again not go according to plan.

Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Brock Lesnar - The winner of this match would go on to face Triple H for the WWE Championship in the main event at WrestleMania.  Brock knew he was the odd man out so he took the fight to both men right at the start with one man being taken to ""Suplex City"" in the opening minute & both opponents continuing to be suplexed multiple times including catching one in mid-air at one point to deliver another one while Dean Ambrose continue to show how much of a lunatic he was by continuing to taunt & attack Brock in different ways only to get the fight taken to him & begging for more while all three men would take advantage of an opening whenever the situation occurred with two opponents so focused on fighting each other that they would temporarily forget about the third man as this match went on with various highlights such as Reigns & Ambrose resorting to their old days of The Shield to take out Brock more than once only for them to immediately turn on each other using whatever they could get their hands on to beat on each other as both men showed how well they knew each other by having counters & avoiding the other's offense in a match that was nothing short of physical.

(Pre-show) 2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: United States Champion Kalisko vs. Alberto Del Rio - Del Rio focused on a specific area of the body right away along with attempting to disrespect Kalisko only for him to respond using his speed for quick strikes & lucha inspired high flying offense as the contest went to the floor with both men taking advantage of their surroundings with one man showing what J.B.L. put on commentary as ""more focused on winning a war than a battle"" as the action returned to the ring with Del Rio putting Kalisko in a specific position more than once to attack with both men performing moves from using a tilt-a-wirl & from the top rope in another really good encounter in their series of matches over the past few weeks that told a good story.

This was a really good show with the only real negative I have is that the show pretty much died right before the main event with the talk segment & pointless short match which could have been easily switched with the pre-show match but that's about it as I enjoyed the show & it's worth checking out.",1456444800,3,6035,4.603720930232559
