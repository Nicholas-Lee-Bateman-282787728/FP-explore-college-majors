1887889,5,B00009PY16,I first got this in VHS . I have enjoyed it over and over again. Now I bought the DVDD version. If you have ever been to the Concord or any Catskills resorts you will love this!,1390608000,,177,3.810810810810811
1887890,3,B00009PY16,"We laughed a lot, but I think this appeals to an older generation that grew up with Catskill humor.  Not sure my children would enjoy, and surely not my grandchildren.",1372464000,,167,4.566666666666666
1887891,5,B00009PY16,"We've shared this with many people and laugh every time we watch it.  We're especially fond of
Mal Lawrence's part in the film.",1365379200,,127,4.521739130434782
1887892,5,B00009PY16,If you were ever in the Borscht Belt you will truly enjoy these comdians. If you were never in the Borscht Belt these story tellers will give you an idea of what that experience was all about.,1342310400,,192,4.216216216216216
1887893,5,B00009PY16,Catskills on Broadway is a wonderful way to remember the golden days of the hotels in that area....the food...the activities...and the comedians! Such a training ground for young talent does not exist...which is a shame!,1307491200,,220,5.314285714285714
1887894,5,B00009PY16,"How can you criticize a show that is called ""Catskills on Broadway"" by complaining that it's too Jewish, too focused on the Catskills, and performed by second-string entertainers?

This show is comedy at its finest! Freddie Roman, Dick Capri, and Mal Z Lawrence were there when it was happening, honing their craft in the Catskills in its golden years. They are hysterical, and when Mal Z goes off on a tangent about the way the guests enjoyed (and lived for) their food in the massive dining rooms, you will be on the floor hysterically laughing.

Louise Duart, although not a borscht belt comedian, is a fine impersonator, and did an incredible job in her poignant interpretation of George Burns that had the audience in tears. But, most of the show had the audience in tears....of laughter!

If you love comedy, if you enjoy memories of the Catskills, and if you love to laugh, you will certainly enjoy this DVD.",1221436800,2,915,4.7421383647798745
1887895,2,B00009PY16,"The jokes are OK even though dated which was to be expected. However, expected more main stream of the Catskills - missing the big places, i.e. Concord etc. and the comedians who made the big time that started there.  These were second string performers; having said that the disc was worth the money. But, PBS has shown better stuff from time to time.",1217116800,,352,4.587301587301587
1887896,3,B00009PY16,"This was an enjoyable DVD but the humor has a limited appeal because it is so narrowly focused on Jewish humor.  The comedians are exceptionally talented but their topics are, because of the audience, narrowly circumscribed.",1153440000,3,224,5.222222222222222
7992421,2,B00009PY16,"What a disappointment ! I saw Catskills on B'way when it was ON B'way. I thought this was that show....sadly it's not. That show was the greatest, this isn't. I wish I hadn't bought 2 videos [ one was supposed to be a gift].  Freddie Roman is the only FUNNY PERSON on this disc.",1493164800,,278,4.148148148148148

7992423,5,B00009PY16,"I am 34 years old. I watched this with my grandparents, both of whom are in there mid 80's.  We were actually laughing out loud. I came across this while I was at the library looking for a broadway performance on dvd. It was an awesome accident. I'll highly recommend anyone looking for a fun evening add this to your library. I'm considering purchasing one myself. And I've seen it.  Enjoy!!!",1447459200,,393,4.52112676056338
