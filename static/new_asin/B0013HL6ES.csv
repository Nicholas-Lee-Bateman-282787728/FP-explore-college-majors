3111180,5,B0013HL6ES,"The Band's Visit is well described on Amazon's main page.  An Egyptian band comes to Israel to play at an Arab culture center in a small town.  They arrive at the wrong town and spend the night there, waiting for the next day's bus to take them to their performance site.  In the meantime almost nothing happens, except that the Egyptians and the Israelis learn of their common humanity.  Nothing 'happens', but they learn everything.  The film is sweet, funny, heart-rending at times and cinematically perfect.  Each group has its representative figures, the predictability of the varieties of the human spirit underscoring their true humanity and deep commonality.  The film has been subjected to some political slings and arrows since there are both Israeli and Palestinian actors working together here.  When the director was asked about this, at Ebertfest, he responded that his job is to create art and he has no time for politics such as this.  This was the perfect answer.  The film is deeply 'political' because it is deeply human, something for which the deeply political often have little time.  The performances are very special and the film's warmth and beauty transcends the stark, lonely landscape in which they are revealed.  This little film is now the largest-grossing Israeli film every exhibited in America.  See it.",1209340800,6,1336,5.045662100456621
3111181,5,B0013HL6ES,This is a great little film - in a big way - full of surprising humor and warmth....and it offers hope that our similarities as human beings are more important than our differences.  Every character in this film is memorable.  One of the most charming movies I have seen in a long time,1207267200,4,285,4.3584905660377355
3111182,5,B0013HL6ES,"One of the most humane and psychologically nuanced films I have seen in years. I don't think the director had ever intended this rather short (and probably low budget) film to be a revelation. But it certainly is... at least, it was for this reviewer. The melancholy wind-swept landscape of an Israeli ""middle of nowhere"" (if such a thing can exist in tiny Israel) serves as a backdrop to the travails of a hapless band of Egyptian police musicians lost on a tour of Israel. Their chance encounters with residents of a desert Israeli town provide us with a low key but profound examination of human vulnerabilities, of the tenderness of our inner souls. And that Dina... Simply superb!",1206748800,5,685,4.764705882352941
3111183,5,B0013HL6ES,"It's hard to imagine that a movie could be made about Arabs and Israelis without offending someone.  ""The Band's Visit"" may accomplish that seemingly impossible task.  Politics are invisible -- and that's one reason the movie is so entertaining.

An aging, ragtag eight-man Egyptian band is stranded in a desolate and dull town in Israel overnight.  Without much in the way of money they depend upon the questionable goodwill of the local Israelis to feed and house them. The interaction between the Egyptians -- formal and dignified -- and the Israelis -- rough and tough, but good-hearted -- is explored slowly and meticulously. There's no excitement here, or flashy scenes.  The movie holds your attention by developing an interest in the characters.  It's amusing but not funny.

In a wonderful scene, for example, the neer-do-well of the band, a handsome young womanizer, teaches a painfully shy young Israeli boy how to romance his equally shy girl friend at a roller rink.

You wonder throughout the movie when the band is going to play music. Be patient.  It does -- in the genre of classical Arab music, or so I understand.

Smallchief",1206748800,7,1144,4.942408376963351
3111184,4,B0013HL6ES,"The Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra gets lost in Israel. After taking a wrong bus from the airport, this small police band from Egypt is stranded at a small, sleepy town in Israel. Tired and hungry, eight members of the band all clad in light-blue uniform decide to stay overnight at the place. Using this simple story, Israeli-born director Eran Kolirin (his feature film debut) has made a very amusing and charming film.

Israel-France-US film ""The Band's Visit"" relates a set of episodes about the band's members and the local residents. Nothing big happens here, just small things that happen between Israeli hosts and Egyptian guests, but all these small things matter in ""The Bands Visit,"" a bitter-sweet tale that will make you smile in a traditional way, without being too political.

The most impressive part for me is about the band's rigid and stoic conductor Tawfiq (Sasson Gabai) and the restaurant owner Dina (Ronit Elkabetz), who is also an attractive woman (in red dress). Difficulties of communication still lie between them when he reluctantly accepts her invitation to dinner, but they slowly begin to reveal what is hidden deep in their heart to one another (and us) - after all Tawfiq may not be the only one who has been left stranded at this quiet town. The excellent performances from Sasson Gabai and Ronit Elkabetz are really fantastic.

Another memorable episode is an equally charming and almost silent one. It happens at the roller disco scene where one of the band's younger members teaches a timid local boy how to seduce a girl. It is a little gem and you have to see it for yourself to understand that sometimes silence is the best way to tell a good story.

The theme of the film may not be particularly new, and it must be said that this quiet film may require patience for some viewers. Still with the great performances from the cast ""The Band's Visit"" is a lovely little film with genuinely magical moments.",1202947200,20,1952,4.817910447761194

3111202,2,B0013HL6ES,"It would be great to have more movies about Arabs and Israelis mixing it up, accidentally or otherwise, but why insist on boring us to death?  The beginning scene of a town in the middle of nowhere with no movement or talk was enough to get that idea across.  Hurry up after that -- if you have anything to say or offer in a movie....move!  I think the director must have overemphasized BOREDOM to the actors and literally FORCED dead time on each and every scene -- unnaturally. Communicating the presence of boredom in the location is different from boring the audience to death thorough-out a movie. Plot, universal themes, change, are required for art

Rich people like to visit poor towns and then leave after a few hours saying ""how touching, how moving..."" They feel good for visiting.  It is not OK to leave things like that in a artistic work.  We don't go to movies and fiction for that kind of dead end.  The idea of bringing the Alexandria police band to this dried out Israeli town was good. The authenticity of the the people was good.  But you still have to DO something with the material and work to improve what develops:

For example, the ""general"" could have shared his guilt over his son's suicide and wife's broken heart WHILE they were on the bench and the woman could have asked how he knew it was his fault, and whether there may be other factors that contributed to the suicide, challenging his stuckness...This would have brought in  the real poverty underlying his life....his choice of music as an outlet..a choice in his life that no doubt brought both good and bad....a moment of awareness, perhaps even an element of self-forgiveness...

The woman was a good actress but she could have started out more antagonistic toward Arab visitors then been changed forever by her encounter (yes, FOREVER, why not? Is that too unsophisticated? Impossible for poor people?)...her pain from the general's rejection could have been shown, quickly, sensitively, as motivation for her behavior: that is, her having desperate sex with the young man.  Instead the sex comes across as simply tawdry and low-life, cynical without human feeling or human awareness.

A few changes and a little honest speech and immediately more depth and a solid movie.  Instead the film maker insists on deadness, boredom, failure, brokenness, END OF STORY.

More music...more, Arabic or Middle Eastern  music, easily added, would have improved the movie tenfold.  The last song sung by the general was utterly fantastic..I was so hungry for it by the end.  Again why why why bore us to death until this last performance of the band? The theme of the movie should have been the universality of music. Emphasize boredom in the music if you insist, but the music could carry the magically sustenance of the blues.

The movie's awards are feel-good trophies.  I hate being fooled by that kind of thing.  Awards resting on political feel-good should be distinguished as such so that we know what're paying for.  Make a politically liberal feel-good movie, but it must be art too.",1456617600,,3069,4.816793893129771

3111218,4,B0013HL6ES,"The Egyptian Police Band is supposed to perform at the opening of an Arab cultural center somewhere in Israel, but due to a series of miscommunications they end up in the tiny desolate desert town of Bet Hatikva. They've arrived on the last bus of the day, and the woman who runs the local caf agrees to put them up for the night at her home as well as the home of a friend. They can communicate only in English, because the Egyptians speak Arab and the Israelis speak Hebrew. The stiff, unemotional band leader, Tewfiq, keeps a tight rein on the 7 other band members, most of whom remain silent and stiff in the bright blue uniforms.

The band members communicate awkwardly with the locals, but through a long evening, they manage to break down some cultural barriers and open up to each other a bit. Dina, the caf owner, is lonely and stifled in this tiny town and tries to reach out to Tewfiq, but he can't really loosen his tie and get to know each other in the way she really wants.

The film strives to be humorous at times, but there are few laugh out loud moments. Quirky, uncomfortable, maybe a bit heartwarming, the film demonstrates that people are people everywhere, regardless of language and cultural barriers.",1426982400,,1224,4.53393665158371

3111237,5,B0013HL6ES,"'It's the wrong time and the wrong place...' - there are so many excerpts of songs quoted in this movie and ones that stimulate memories of old songs that are very much in keeping with the title and the story, THE BAND'S VISIT (BIKUR HA-TIZMORET). A timely piece, this little film is about humanity and the possibility of communication by various means that overcome differences between cultures far better than treaties, summit meetings, and physical and verbal demonstrations. It is a thoughtful, engaging, and completely delightful success.

The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra with 'General' Tewfiq (Sasson Gabai) rigidly in charge provides music for occasions, and the particular occasion for this venture is a ceremony in Israel. Flying in from Egypt well dressed in light blue uniforms to perform for the new Arab Culture Center, the small band is not met as expected at the airport. Tewfiq attempts to resolve the lack of proper greeting and transportation by reserving space on a bus - a trip that mistakenly (through problems originating in language confusion) results in the band being dropped off in a small village Bet Hatikva. Frustrated with circumstances, the band is met with genial hospitality by caf owner Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) who not only feeds them but puts the small band up for the evening. Dina has eyes for Tewfig and plans an evening out on the town with him - an evening that has its own surprises as each lonely person shares life circumstances. The other members of the band are placed in lodging with Dina's workers and at a dinner party discover similarities in their lives. Khaled (Saleh Bakri), a somewhat antagonistic ladies' man, spends an evening with a terrified young man Papi (Shlomi Avraham) on his first real date, and in the course of the evening introduces the fine art of courtship to Papi in a hilarious but touching scene.

The use of English as the common language between these Arab and Hebrew speaking people adds elements of humor as well as moments of sweetness as both the band members and the Israelis grow to know and care about each other. The conversations among each separate group are delivered in Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles and this degree of modified privacy becomes almost more humorous because of the bumpy language barriers shared with the audience. Everyone grows through this short visit and by the time the band departs for their correct destination by the next morning's bus, bonds have been made that preserve the dignity of nationality while overriding the limitations of differences peculiar to each country. This is a quiet, gentle, at times very humorous little movie that offers insights of how to attain global community for us all. Writer/director Eran Kolirin deserves special recognition for assembling and molding this excellent cast for this remarkable, genuinely compassionate statement about important issues.

3111238,5,B0013HL6ES,"The Band's Visit is a little masterpiece by Eran Kolirin who both wrote the script and directed the film. On the surface, there are gaps of silence that make the plot appear slow moving but in actuality the silence mixed with the dialogue makes for a powerful statement about humanity in general and how people can relate to one another even when they have been enemies much, much longer than they have been on somewhat friendly terms. The casting was very well done and the acting, often by relatively unknown actors, is completely convincing and memorable at once. The cinematography and the choreography work well and the musical score enhances the film.

When the film starts, we quickly meet members of The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra who have traveled from Egypt to Israel to play at the opening of an Arabic cultural center. Unfortunately for the members of the band, they arrive without anyone to welcome them--and thanks to the stubborn pride of uptight, repressed band leader Lieutenant-Colonel Tawfiq Zacharya (Sasson Gabai) who refuses to ask for help they go by bus to a remote Israeli town of Beit Hatikva instead of Petah Tiqva after womanizing band member Haled (Saleh Bakri) gets the wrong directions at a bus terminal because of a language gap.

The band meets the owner of a small restaurant in Beit Hatikva, Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) and her friends Papi (Shlomi Avraham) and Itzik (Rubi Moskovitz). Tawfiq feels very awkward but the band members are hungry and so he asks Dina for some food. Dina, who tries to hide her loneliness by acting very self-confident and even bouncy at times, gives in and feeds them--and, because there are no more buses that night, arranges for the band members to spend the night in her home and Itzik's home; the band will be able to continue on to Petah Tiqva the following morning. This is much to Itzik's chagrin because it's his wife Iris' birthday; but Dina puts her foot down and the band members stay.

3111239,5,B0013HL6ES,"The Band's Visit is a little masterpiece by Eran Kolirin who both wrote the script and directed the film. On the surface, there are gaps of silence that make the plot appear to move too slowly but in actuality the silence mixed with the dialogue makes for a powerful statement about how people can relate to one another even when they have been enemies much, much longer than they have been on somewhat friendly terms, not to mention humanity in general. The casting was very well done and the acting, often by relatively unknown actors, is completely convincing and memorable at once. The cinematography and the choreography work well and the musical score enhances the film.

When the film starts, we quickly meet members of The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra who have traveled from Egypt to Israel to play at the opening of an Arabic cultural center. Unfortunately for the members of the band, they arrive without anyone to welcome them--and thanks to the stubborn pride of uptight, repressed band leader Lieutenant-Colonel Tawfiq Zacharya (Sasson Gabai) who refuses to ask for help they go by bus to a remote Israeli town of Beit Hatikva instead of Petah Tiqva after womanizing band member Haled (Saleh Bakri) gets the wrong directions at a bus terminal because of a language gap.

The band meets the owner of a small restaurant in Beit Hatikva, Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) and her friends Papi (Shlomi Avraham) and Itzik (Rubi Moskovitz). Tawfiq feels very awkward but the band members are hungry and so he asks Dina for some food. Dina, who tries to hide her loneliness by acting very self-confident and even bouncy at times, gives in and feeds them--and, because there are no more buses that night, arranges for the band members to spend the night in her home and Itzik's home; the band will be able to continue on to Petah Tiqva the following morning. This is much to Itzik's chagrin because it's his wife Iris' birthday; but Dina puts her foot down and the band members stay.

Of course there's more to the plot and I've already left out some of the details.

3111240,5,B0013HL6ES,"This is a film about the complications around behaving with decency. It is cinematic story telling at its best. It is a simple enough story, a brass band commissioned to play at a ceremony. The difference is it involves an Egyptian police band playing in Israel. Due to a stuff up, they are left stranded at the airport, but resourceful, they make their own way to where they are supposed to play. From there it is about trying to honour the gig and the interplay of the different personalities in the band and the Israelis they meet. It is a series of interactions of worlds interacting that would otherwise not have ever had contact with one another. It brims with humanity. It is remarkably lacking in judgements. Overall, it gives five stars for humanity when we share a common decency, when we are prepared to communicate across the deepest gulf and share what we have in common.",1350000000,,884,4.6369426751592355

They have taken the wrong bus and another bus will not come until tomorrow.  Across the street is a small cafe, evidently the only business in town. Regarding them are two bored layabouts and a sad, darkly beautiful woman.  They feed the Egyptian men and put them up for the night.  This Arab-Israeli interaction becomes a quiet, sweet, funny sharing of loneliness which adds poignancy to the finale when the band does at last play its concert.

3111243,4,B0013HL6ES,"I made a New Year's Resolution this year to watch a movie each from the four world regions I had never seen a movie from. One of them was the Middle East, so I chose ""The Band's Visit,"" which was at the library where I go to college. I was expecting a low key, slow-paced film with a few chuckles, and that was just what I got. However, I also got more: the movie has some interesting thoughts about music, I really related to the main character, Tawfiq, and I enjoyed the music in the movie. It's unassuming and tells a very simple story, which is part of its appeal. The tone reminded me a little bit of the German film ""Schultze gets the blues,"" in that both are about music, culture clash, and don't try to do anything except simply tell a story. The acting is very good in The Band's Visit, and there are touching moments as well as funny ones. It also captivated me because it showed me something new - everyone in the movie is Semitic, and it is my first Middle Eastern movie. Being a language major, I also found it interesting that the Egyptians spoke Arabic amongst themselves and the Israelis spoke Hebrew amongst themselves, but they spoke English to each other. In other words, it was interesting to hear my own language used so much in a film made in such a distant place. The Band's Visit also showed that Middle Eastern people have a lot of the same things that we have in America. I wasn't expecting a skating rink to be in rural Israel, but I can't say I've ever thought about it, either. If you like music and straightforward movies, and especially if you like both, I recommend The Band's Visit.",1332720000,,1615,4.368770764119601

3111245,5,B0013HL6ES,"This delightful gem contains a subtle and powerfully moving tale of how, underneath our differences, we all carry the same sense of loss and hope, sadness and joy. Whether it was the cultural differences between the Egyptian band members and their Israeli saviours, or between the easy-going charm of the youngest band member Haled clashing with the stiff formality of the Colonel, this movie stripped away differences and revealed the heart of the human soul. At times, there were gentle moments so poignantly funny, we weren't sure whether to laugh or cry!

The cast of actors was superb. While all the actors, to the briefest comic appearance (such as the airport cleaner), were excellent, the performance by Sasson Gabai as Lieutenant-Colonel Tawfiq Zacharya was simply superb. Ronit Elkabetz as the kind-hearted, lively but lonely Dina refusing to wilt in her bleak Isreali settlement town, also turned in an outstanding performance (coming close to her brilliant rendition of Ruthie in ""Or, My Treasure"".)

The story of The Band's Visit is of a police band who somehow end up one town over from where they are supposed to be for a concert the following night. The movie thus revolves around this one night stuck in a very (and I do mean ""very"") sleepy outpost in Israel.

Filled with excellent acting performances from all concerned, the director also understands it's not necessary to fill up the movie with dialogue. Much of it is in Hebrew or Arabic with broken English bridging the gap (and this is broken English that seems quite natural among people who would obviously not be fluent give their circumstances and background). The situations are simply delightful and have an almost Napoleon Dynamite quality to them from the visit to a local roller rink to the two main actors visit to a ""park.""

It's definitely a movie that is much more than the sum of its parts. It touches on how life can bring the strangest of bedfellows together in ways that give us all hope that no matter how simple a town may seem, it is filled with people who have stories to tell.

3111250,2,B0013HL6ES,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This low key ""dramedy"" from Israel is about a police band from Alexandria, Egypt scheduled to play at an Arab Cultural Center in a particular Israeli town. They end up in the wrong town and spend the night as guests of a single Israeli woman and a young married Israeli man. Although the band consists of eight men, the screenwriter fleshes out only three of them.

The main character is the band's leader, Tawfiq who mainly interacts with the film's protagonist, Dina, the single Israeli woman who tries to make the best of life in what she considers a boring town. There's also Khaled, the youngest member of the band who goes into town with a young Israeli guy and ends up coaching him on how to be more successful with woman. And finally there's Simon, who ends up playing his unfinished ""concerto"" for Itzik, the young Israeli married man trapped in an unhappy marriage. The movie tries to stress the common humanity of both the Israelis and the Egyptians as they awkwardly interact with one another. The only two characters who rise above sentimental stereotypes are Tawfiq and Dina. Tawfiq is first introduced as being a bit of an authoritarian, especially how he won't allow Simon to conduct the band and orders Khaled around as if he's a child. But later, Dina brings out Tawfiq's softer side when he confesses that his son committed suicide and his wife died of a broken heart; revealing that it was his own heavy handed methods of child-rearing that led to the son's suicide. One wonders what causes Tawfiq to be so impressed with Dina. She confesses while they have coffee in a diner that she's having an affair with a married man. Later at the end of the film, Tawfiq gets up in the middle of the night and overhears Dina and Khaled having sex. Nonetheless, he thanks Dina for her hospitality when the group leaves the next morning.

Dina is impressive as a world weary single still looking for love but again I question how she was able to open up shy Tawfiq in the space of one night. Khaled isn't all that believable as both ""love counselor"" and rebellious band member. Beyond the little comic moment when he shows Papi how to be successful with women at the skating rink, a few moments of tension with Tawfiq and the fleeting glance of him having sex with Dina, we don't find out much more about him. Even worse is Simon and Itzik who bond over Simon's unfinished musical composition. Itzik has a few comic lines about the difficulties of his marriage and Simon has nothing more to do than his play his clarinet. The other band members are mainly content to remain silent and let the three principals do the talking.

Much of the conflict between the characters in this film is too ""soft"". It allows the filmmaker to suggest that Arabs and Israelis can overcome their differences since they are so alike. But people are more complex and the screenwriter fails to give his characters enough nuances and enough conflict for this drama to work on a deeper level.

Nonetheless, the film keeps one's interest to the end and there are enough revelations (albeit underdeveloped) that make this film worthwhile seeing.",1286841600,2,3169,4.672043010752688
3111251,4,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is an unusual film.  Gentle, warm, insightful but never reaching to great heights.  This is a pity.  I believe it had much to offer.  It somehow failed to convince in the end.

Briefly, the film covers the visit to Israel by the Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra.  They are due to play at the Arab Cultural Centre in an Israeli town but manage to catch the wrong bus.  They end up in a boring little town in the desert.  They are lost and out place.  It is how the band interacts with the locals that is the basis of the film.

I suspect that many might think that an Egyptian orchestra in Israel would be the setting for hostility.  Rather, the two sets of people seem to get on well.  They are both tolerant and patient.  The film succeeds in bringing this relationship to life.  Unfortunately, it does little else.  The film is a study of reactions between two peoples.

The acting by the cast of relative unknowns is excellent.  Hollywood should take a hint.  Big names don't necessarily make great films.  Yet, for all its charm (and it has this in bucket loads), the film fails to compel.  It needs something more than just a study of characters.  It seems to meander at times.  It lacks a plot.  Put simply, there is something missing.  This is a shame.  The film has much to offer.  It could have been great but fails to make the final step.",1279929600,,1373,4.413654618473895
3111252,4,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is a charming, small film about misplaced people in foreign cultures that manages to have no overbearing message other than we're often more common than we want to think we are. After a language issues accidentally diverts the eight member Egyptian Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra to the middle of nowhere, they have to depends, warily, on the kindness of Israeli strangers. The Israelis, led by free-spirited Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) separate the band between three families, the staid leader of the orchestra, General Tewfiq (Sasson Gabai) winds up with her.

Little scenarios come up that are more gentle than caustic in their conflict, and are often humorous, sometime melancholy. The scene where ladies man Khaled (Saleh Bakri) coaches the shy Papi at the roller-rink in the fine art of the Pick Up is hilarious. The scene where the frustrated composer Simon and his host Itzik dwell over lost idealism is sadly touching. But none of these scenes is forced or exploitative, while they've had the power to stay in my memory for quite some time. Watching Tewfiq attempt to explain music with his conductor's gestures alone made me love this film, and I recommend it highly for those who don't mind spending time with a movie that opens itself up gradually without banging you over the head.",1279411200,,1316,5.0091324200913245

3111255,5,B0013HL6ES,"Unfortunately it seems that most of the reviewers have missed the point of this film- which is understandable, as when I initially first saw it, I missed the point too. It's very subtly expressed
and depends on an insider's understanding of Israeli society.

Expecting a tale of cultural rapprochement, of an underlying common humanity despite cultural differences, I was disappointed to find precious little bridge building taking place. I kept waiting for the moment of enlightenment, the turning point, a climax which never came, not even in the final sexual encounter. I left wondering what the point was.

Upon analysis, I realize that the film is not about Egyptians and Israelis meeting each other, and reaching accross cultural difference. The film is about Israelis looking for a part of themselves that has been lost.

The first clue is the location of the fictional town of Bet Hatikva: A dusty desert town in the Negev. The type of town that would have been initially settled by North African Jews, the parents and grandparents of the film participants. So we are not talking about people from accross cultures; we are talking about people from nearly the exact same culture! How did such a gap develop?

The second clue is language: The film was not admitted to the foreign language competition because too much of the dialogue was in English. But why are the Egyptians and Israelis speaking English to each other? This is not just a political statement- that neighboring countries don't know each other's language. This goes beyond that, if you realize that ARABIC was the first language of the parents of the Israeli film participants. Remember how Dina recalls how the whole neighborhood used to shut down while everyone watched Arab movies on TV? But now, they cant speak a word of arabic.

The cultured Egyptian band members contrast markedly with the Israelis. How did these Jews wind up with ""No Arab culture, no Israeli culture, no culture at all""??? Upon meeting the Egyptians, the Israelis sense a shadow of their lost selves, and sense a longing to fill it.  Dina is not just a desperate divorcee looking to bed an exotic stranger in uniform. She seeks a lost part of herself, and she seeks in sex, what she failed to accomplish in speech and in deed.

In an ironic twist, the film reverses the mythical role of the Jews in the world: In the diaspora the Jews were the wandering, the homeless, the sojourners who birthed two great religions and in many other ways imparted culture to their host societies. But in their homeland, in this little town of Bet Hatikva,  it is the wandering Egyptians who arrive bearing culture, from their music to their guidance in matters of romance.

This is a film about Jews in search of themselves in the aftermath of cultural upheaval, in my opinion an unacknowledged source of many social tensions (class, ethnic, religious) in modern Israel today.",1277510400,5,2909,4.872469635627531

In Eran Kolirin`s stripped-down and understated human comedy ""The Band's Visit,"" a small orchestra made up of eight uniformed Egyptian policemen travels to Israel as part of a cultural-exchange program.  Thanks to a scheduling snafu, the band members find themselves stranded in a tiny village in the Negev Desert where they are looked after by a kind and attractive restaurateur (the luminous Ronit Elkabetz) and one of her friends who agree to put the men up for the night.  The musicians include a crusty old conductor, played by the marvelously deadpan Sasson Gabai, and a handsome young womanizer and trumpet player (Saleh Bakri) who don't exactly see eye-to-eye on much concerning either music or life.

Like many such films from abroad, ""The Band's Visit"" eschews obvious narrative flourishes in favor of a more slice-of-life approach to storytelling - indeed, almost to a fault in the case of this particular film.  Yet, while there are times when the movie's ""smallness"" is of so determined and deliberate a nature that it begins to border on the self-conscious, ""The Band's Visit"" finds its truths in the minutiae of everyday life, in the heartfelt exchanges between characters (particularly between Gabai and Elkabetz), and in the way it acknowledges the commonality of the human condition.  The people in the film may come from different - even antagonistic - cultures, but they are quick to discover that there is far more that unites them than divides them in the grander scheme of things.

Coming in at a brief 86-minute running time, ""The Band's Visit"" is a mere vignette in what is obviously a larger tale of Egypt/Israel relations, one that makes its case for cooperation among all the world's peoples without undue fuss or fanfare.",1269734400,5,1758,5.041379310344827

The picture of the eight of them in their formal powder blue uniforms against the stark desert landscape says it all. They're lost. What happens next is not a summit meeting that will solve all the Israeli-Palestinian issues but it does show how, as human beings, we all share similar stories in this journey called life. The story centers on three main people, the very stern, rigid leader of the band, a young free-spirited ladies man in the band and a middle aged woman who runs a deli and agrees to put the band up for the night since there is no hotel and the last bus for the day has left. Both the woman and the band leader open up to each other in ways they would never have expected at the beginning of that day. This is a delightful little story that reminds us that some of the best moments in life can be the unplanned ones, the interruptions that are initially very frustrating but can be life changing or, at least, very influential. Like having a flat tire in the middle of nowhere and a stranger stops to help. Though this movie does not attempt to solve any of the world's big problems, it does remind one that, as humans, we forget that we have more in common than we realize.

3111266,5,B0013HL6ES,"I loved this movie.  It is a true gem.

The story is about an Egyptian Police Band that is supposed to do a performance at the opening of a new Egyptian Cultural Center in Israel.  One of the band's members asks for directions to the city and mispronounces the Hebrew word for the town.  Thus, the misadventures start.

The band ends up in a small town in the middle of nowhere.  It is certainly not a place of any culture says the woman who runs the restaurant where their bus lets them off.

This comedic and poignant film unfolds duing a period of little more than 24 hours, until the band can catch the next bus to the right place.  We see lust, love, pain, grief and hope.  We laugh a lot. I guffawed a few times. We are witness to how people learn to accept one another and go past their prior negative feelings.

I recommend this movie without reservation.  It is wonderful.",1235347200,2,881,4.310975609756097

3111268,5,B0013HL6ES,"... and I'm an easy mark for slow movies! Most of my favorites are slow, sly, and understated - Wild Strawberries, Babette's Feast, Ikiru, for examples. ""The Band's Visit"" isn't quite that good, but it's one of the most intelligently slow films I've seen recently. The redoubtable Grady Harp has done a competent job of summarizing the action and introducing the characters, leaving me free to be tangential. Being tangential goes hand in glove with loving slow movies, and The Band's Visit is one huge tangent on the insanity of the Arab-Israeli hate fest. The very ordinary Israelis and the quirky but also ordinary Egyptians in this film show an ability to accept each other's humanity that would win them all Nobel Peace Prizes if they were in charge of anything.

""The Band's Visit"" is also wryly funny. Not the loud guffaw kind of funny. Mostly the tightly engaged chuckle kind of funny, though a few scenes brought audible whoops from my teenage son. And it's sad. Yes, very sad. The two principal characters -- the widowed Egytian bandmaster and the divorced Israeli 'woman of a certain age' -- are too real not to be sad. Two more disparate humans couldn't be found on the planet, and yet they emerge with a sincere appreciation of each other. The acting, by the way, in this film is so natural and and crafty that one has to pinch oneself to remember that 'they' were acting. Perhaps that's why so many reviewers have stopped at four stars in their ratings; the artfulness of this movie is so understated and sly that the viewers forget they're watching a film, an artifact of cameras and cutting rooms. This film deserved all the various industry awards that it received from people who appreciate their art.",1234137600,,1719,4.749163879598663
3111269,5,B0013HL6ES,"If you like slapstick humor, or if you think TV sit-coms are funny, you probably won't like this movie.  The humor in this movie is much more sophisticated.  One scene was particularly funny when one of the band members, who viewed himself as quite a ladies man, was coaching one of the Jewish men, who was painfully shy with women.  Like all the humor in this movie, it is dead-pan humor.  The band leader never cracks a smile because he takes everything so seriously; but the situations he encounters are very funny.  This movie uses humor to show the universality of the human experience, and that it can overcome political differences.  The movie works because it is an Egyptian band, a country at peace with Israel; I don't think it would work if it was an Hamas or Palestinian band.  One other aspect I found interesting was that when the Hebrew speaking Jews talked directly to the Arabic speaking Egyptians, they used English! - [So, it is not all subtitled, although you might want to use closed captioning because of their accents.]

It is a shame that several reviewers here have such an immature understanding of humor that they can't get past the TV humor that is so stupid or put-down that they have to put in a laugh track to let people know when to laugh.  This movie is for those with a mature sense of humor.",1233532800,,1326,4.53781512605042
3111270,5,B0013HL6ES,"When the blue-uniformed Egyptian police band 'The Alexandria Ceremonial Orchestra' gets lost in small town Israel on its way to an Arab cultural centre, it sets the scene for personal and ideological differences to be tested and turned around - and the results are both achingly funny and truly life-affirming. ""The Band's Visit"" has clocked up over 35 International awards and having enjoyed every rather lovely and quirky minute of it, I can easily see why it's captured the hearts of so many.

Tewfiq - the regimental, guarded and awkward 65-year old bandleader - is played with truly stunning restraint by veteran Arab actor SASSON GABAI - who in turns strikes up an unlikely relationship with the town's feisty and vibrant 35-year old caf owner Dina - played with relish and gusto by the gorgeous RONIT ELKABETZ - an actress who lights up the screen every second she's on it. This woman has a choker of gold around her ankle and her toenails are painted - any interesting man who comes to her 'dead' town had better watch out. Tewfiq is an interesting man - despite their huge age difference. But he's also the sort of old school gentleman who will open a door for a lady, but won't answer her probing personal questions - even if love 'is' on the cards...

The orchestra of 8 has its youngest member in the womanizing romantic that is Halib - played by the handsome SALEH BAKRI. The scene where he sings ""My Funny Valentine"" to a pretty receptionist behind a glass protection panel at the airport is both hilarious and touching.

In some respects not a lot happens in ""The Band's Visit"" - hours pass, backgammon is played, roads lined with thousands of overhanging streetlights stretch out for miles in either direction without a car every bothering the shimmering tarmac. A fork falls on the kitchen floor, someone clips a moustache, a hat is hung over a picture of a tank so as not to offend. But then - against all this boredom and monochrome existence - you're hit with scenes of unexpected tenderness. There's a local lad waiting all night by the town callbox for his girlfriend to call. The shy and awkward band member played superbly by KHALIFA MATOUR sitting on the bed of the family who have offered him overnight accommodation; he's watching their baby boy sleep - when he suddenly gets the notes in his head to finish that concerto for clarinet he's been writing, but sadly never finished. His face as he realizes his dream. Or in the local dancehall - where the impossibly awkward and shy lad Papi - who wants an equally awkward and shy girl - is helped by the woman-knowing Halib. It's as funny and as tender as cinema gets - truly fantastic stuff.

Alongside the silences is the other character - Music - and its ability to break down barriers, bring people together, dissipate awkward situations. It features heavily throughout the film and it gives the piece its emotional heart. The father of the family who sings Gershwin's ""Summertime"" at the dinner table and all the religions join in; the pop music on the radio in the car breaking the silence for the youngsters as they drive through Saturday night; the band practising an Arabic lullaby in the warm evening air outside the town caf...

But there's better than that. There are about five scenes with Tewfiq and Dina where their discussions about men and women and marriage and children - are just electrifying - and its easy to see why so many of those International Film Awards were for the screenplay which the Writer/Director ERAN KOLIRIN freely admits took 9 years to perfect. Dina is lonely despite her vivaciousness and Tewfiq has deep hidden pain. When Gabai and Elkabetz are together, they're dialogue and interaction really are something else - both of them rising to the great material. (His discussion about fishing being the most 'important thing in the world' gives this review its title).

If you were to highlight downsides, they'd only be minor niggles - the entire end credits rolling up in front of you are in Arabic and not in English so you can't understand a single word - nor know who did what. And in the Special Features Section - the Photo Gallery pictures many of the actors without telling us Westerners who they are. Sloppy. However, these are countered by a lovely 20-minute ""Making Of The Fairy Tale"" featurette, which has interviews with the director, the traditional/modern music editor HABIB SHADAD and the principal actors - and is both warm and very illuminating.

With Arabs and Jews, Palestinian and Israeli artists all making this movie together - ""The Band's Visit"" is Israeli cinema coming of age and something of a cultural milestone. It's about music and love and made with the same. Eran Kolirin has produced a little gem out of all that political mayhem and personal demarcation - and he and his crew should be rightly proud of it.

Like ""Caramel"" and ""The Namesake"", this is a foreign film that does not dwell on the extinction of life, but the living of it. I was deeply moved.

Put ""Bikur Ha-Tizmoret"" or ""The Band's Visit"" high on your rental/to buy list - highly recommended.",1233273600,,5102,4.736486486486487

When this group of musicians is invited to come to Israel in the local Arabic Cultural Center to perform, they find themselves on a wrong bus and in the wrong village.  Stranded in the city with limited resources and no translators, the band is left to their own devices for food, and overnight sleep.  This is where the hearwarming part of the movie starts.  Locals unaccustomed to any visitors, open their hearts and homes to these strangers.  Simple show of kindness such as giving them food and a bed to sleep opens up everyone involved in the deeper reflection about their own lives, their purpose, about the art and about meaning of family and community.  One cannot help but laugh about universal domestic bickering; understanding about strain unemployment brings to a young family; heartbreak about loneliness and despair; universal need for love and understanding.

3111273,5,B0013HL6ES,"This is a beautiful film leaving the viewer uplifted, and with a renewed sense of hope.  An Egyptian Police Ceremonial Band, played mostly by Palestinian actors, ends up in the wrong town on their way to an Arab cultural center opening.  As they emerge from the bus, they are in a remote Israeli town, with no bus out until the next morning, no hotel in town, presumably no other Arabs in town, and essentially no money.

The band is led by a very stiff ""General"" who is now forced to depend upon the kindness of strangers in looking after his charges, until the next bus out of town the next day.

Although it could have been a mindless comedy, the film takes a very serious approach to character development and depicting the interaction of the two cultures, resulting in many intensely humorous moments.

All the main characters are touched by the meeting of these two cultures and groups of peoples, and changed by it in positive ways.

The movie's humanity and love characterize it, and give us all hope for greater interaction between Arabs and Israelis along a similar vein, allowing such a recipe to emerge again, and again.

3111274,5,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is a charming, gentle, low-key art film telling the tale of a  touring Egyptian police band that finds itself stranded in a podunk town in the Israeli desert. Short on cash and having missed the last bus of the days, the forlorn Egyptians are forced to rely on the kindness of strangers -- in this case, the same Israelis who they have recently been at war with. But the Israelis are every bit as forlorn as the Egyptians -- everybody's a little bit broken inside, struggling with the same little lonelinesses and discarded hopes. The two groups don't entirely bridge their cultural gap, but they come pretty close. This is a very deliberate, quiet film -- some may find the pacing a bit glacial, but it certainly pays of in the end. Definitely worth checking out!

3111275,4,B0013HL6ES,"The Band's Visit (2007) aka Bikur Ha-Tizmoret (2007), the directorial debut of Erin Kolirin, is the winner of three 2007 Cannes Festival's awards and 8 Awards of Israeli Academy of Film. Even though its subject, the relations between Jews and Arabs, is complex and controversial, the movie is gentle, sweet, hopeful, optimistic, a little sad, and well worth of seeing. The movie tells about the Egyptian policemen-musicians, the members of the Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra and how they arrived to Israel one day to play at the opening of the Arab Cultural Center in Pet Hatikvah. Somehow, no one met them at the airport, and they took the bus that got them to the small town or rather village of Bet Hatikvah, in the middle of nowhere, or to be precise, somewhere in Negev desert. The musicians with their instruments wearing sky-blue uniforms stuck in Bet Hatikvah for the night because the right bus only comes once a day. How Egyptians and Jews communicate during that night, how they impact one another, what they learn about complete strangers and about themselves - makes the simple but very real and very hopeful story. The film is minimalistic, it does not use special effects or many words but it managed to tell us something important about these people by looking closely at their faces, observing their body language, sympathizing with them. You know, it is so good to see or a chance a movie with no villains, chases, guns, predictable situations, obligatory affairs, etc. It is really nice to be able to get drawn inside the movie, to feel like you've met good friends, not perfect or heroic, sometimes shy and awkward, but real and interesting to us. Two main characters as played by very good Israeli actors who are terrific in their riles and I'd love to see them getting international acclaim. Ronit Elkabeth is stunning - I could not take off my eyes off her face. Intense, passionate, sexy, three times winner of Israel Academy awards for acting, actress/director/writer, she is a national treasure. Sasson Gabai, who is apparently famous in Israel but not outside the country, was also outstanding as the repressed and shy leader of the band, Lieutenant-colonel Tawfiq Zacharya. With the running time only 87 minutes, The Band's Visit is one of the best and most memorable films from last year.

3111276,5,B0013HL6ES,"Good writing, it has been argued, demands a keen sense of what to leave out. This remarkable film excels in its choice of what to omit.

Never before in viewing a film have I so strongly felt the presence of matters off-screen. This film, I believe, is nothing less than a  profound fable about the whole of relations between the Arab and Israeli worlds. Remarkably what triumphs here is the humanity of each culture. Each is heroic; each is humane.

Sadly, there is never peacefulness, just tension never resolved; sadly, there is never triumph, just accomodation. There is an aching sadness throughout the film--there has been loss; there still is loss, there will always be loss. Throughout the film--especially in the silent moments (where I swear you hear the voices of Jewish and Muslim dead) and especially in the memorable shots of empty landscapes and ruminative shots of main characters--which never seem to fully fill the camera frame (where I swear you see the ghosts of Arab and Israeli dead)--there is the weight of a ruinous past, a troubled present, an unresolved future.

They rarely smile, say much or do anything. It seems like this movie has a lot of potential for friednships to form, but it ends up seeming like an inconsequential visit.

3111278,4,B0013HL6ES,"Like the utterly different Paradise Now, The Band's Visit finds the complex humans behind the popular dichotomies of the Middle East.  A budget-pressed Egyptian police band, still resplendent in their (as one character says) ""Michael Jackson"" uniforms arrives in Israel, is not met by their sponsors, takes travel matters into their own hands, and winds up lost and nearly without money in the most dreary desert town this side of Wristcutters: A Love Story.  The band is hungry; its straitlaced director approaches the restaurant owner, Dina, and asks for food and the chance to pay with Egyptian money.  She prepares a meal and, after telling them there is no hotel in town, invites them to stay in her home and that of her unemployed friend with marriage problems and a wife's birthday.

And so the bare desert stage is set for a singular night.  Among the many quiet, amusing and lonely vignettes:  the band director, Tewfiq, reveals his personal sadness to Dina in a concrete plaza as they listen to an imaginary sea; a band member unconsciously wipes out a glass as if in a dubious restaurant, except he's sitting at table with his Israeli hosts; and -- best of all -- the band's ladies man gives dating help in a roller rink to a painfully shy Israeli.

Day comes, the band moves on to its correct destination, and plays.  Life returns to normal, but normal for the dozen characters in The Band's Visit has been forever, if only slightly, altered.",1224720000,,1454,4.764940239043825

However, for those of you who intensely dislike subtitles, almost all the dialog is in English as it's the only language the Egyptians and Israelis share. A small Egyptian Police orchestra is sent to Israel on a cultural exchange program, but gets badly lost due to the differences between Arabic and Hebrew. The band director sends the youngest member of the group to the bus ticket booth, but he's too busy flirting with the pretty vendor to pay much attention to what she's actually saying. In Arabic the letter P doesn't exist, so Arabs usually say B instead as in Bebsi Cola. So instead of going to Petah Tikva, just outside of Tel Aviv, they wind up going to a small isolated desert town, Bet Hatikva where they quickly become stranded. Although both sides are immediately suspicious of each other, the townsfolk take them in and give them food and shelter for the night, and over time the two groups find they have more in common individually and culturally than either imagines. Every thing is low key, and while there's quite a bit of humor throughout, it's not really at anyone's expense. However, the scene where the young Egyptian coaches a young Israeli on how to approach a woman is a scream. Well worth watching.",1224201600,2,1317,4.730434782608696

Due to a mix-up they are not met at the airport and take the bus to the wrong destination - Beit Hatikva instead of Petah Tikva. It turns out to be an almost deserted, run-down hole in the ground somewhere in the desert where, as one character says, there is no Arab culture, no Israeli culture, no culture at all.
  The movie traces the interaction of the band members with some of the locals who offer them hospitality. Little by little, we learn about these characters -- their frustrated hopes and hidden sorrows. Divided by language and culture, they manage to find common ground in some of the small details of daily life.
  This is a quiet, restrained movie which makes its points subtly, without blaring them. It is also a movie, made through cooperation of Israeli Jewish and Palestinian actors, from which politics is entirely absent. These people don't have the time or energy to fight out the Middle East peace process -- they are too busy trying to get through their tough and unsatisfying lives with some dignity intact.
  Visually this movie was a delight. The weird sky blue of the band's uniform is posed against the drab desert background of the town.
  This movie is not flawless. I found it difficult to believe that the feisty lead female character would allow herself to be stuck in a place like Beit Hatikva.

3111283,4,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is an unexpected comedy about the meeting of Arab and Jewish cultures in Israel -unexpected because the cultures don't clash in any obvious way, and there is no hostility between the characters. Instead, a few bored working class Jews living in a dull desert town welcome the change of pace occasioned by a band of stranded Egyptians. The eight-man Alexandria Ceremonial Orchestra has traveled from Egypt to play at the opening of an Arab Cultural Center in Petah Tikva. But through an error of pronunciation, they take the bus to Bet Hatikva instead, a fictional drab desert town dominated by ugly mid-rise apartment buildings. A free-spirited, lonely restaurateur named Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) volunteers herself and two friends to put the band up for the night.

Writer and director Eran Kolirin has made a sweet, low-key dramedy in which everything is played straight, not for laughs. Indeed, Dina's loneliness and band leader Tewfiq Zakaria's (Sasson Gabai) embarrassment are palpable. That's not funny, but the characters seem genuine, and their situation is awkwardly amusing. Ronit Elkabetz deserves a lot of credit for making frank, bored Dina into a real charmer who steals every scene. Saleh Bakri is also a lot of fun to watch as handsome Haled, the band's youngest and most insolent member whose primary pursuit is flirting. Though ""The Band's Visit"" is obviously contrived to make a socio-political statement as well as to entertain, it is successful because these are characters that the audience would want to spend time with.

of playing at the opening of a cultural center.  Their egotistical
band leader gets them lost beyond help and they end up staying where
they are stranded in a small town where there are quirky but sleepy
characters.  The only problem is...it wasn't funny.  I found myself
wanting to laugh.  The movie gets heavy really fast.  The serousness
of these characters lives: an aging divorcee, an arguing young couple,
a social awkward young adult all bog down the storyline.  In the end
all you can manage to do is shake your head.  The only humor in the
movie, as the band tries in the beginning to make their way around

The interactions between locals are as likely to be awkward (and funny) as those between locals and the visitors, just in more familiar ways. Maybe the film is about how emotions can cross cultures (even cultures known to have animosity), but I just found it funny and sweet and (sometimes) sad. But it is very well done, and I recommend it.

3111288,4,B0013HL6ES,"'It's the wrong time and the wrong place...' - there are so many excerpts of songs quoted in this movie and ones that stimulate memories of old songs that are very much in keeping with the title and the story, THE BAND'S VISIT (BIKUR HA-TIZMORET).  A timely piece, this little film is about humanity and the possibility of communication by various means that overcome differences between cultures far better than treaties, summit meetings, and physical and verbal demonstrations.  It is a thoughtful, engaging, and completely delightful success.

The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra with 'General' Tewfiq (Sasson Gabai) rigidly in charge provides music for occasions, and the particular occasion for this venture is a ceremony in Israel.  Flying in from Egypt well dressed in light blue uniforms to perform for the new Arab Culture Center, the small band is not met as expected at the airport. Tewfiq attempts to resolve the lack of proper greeting and transportation by reserving space on a bus - a trip that mistakenly (through problems originating in language confusion) results in the band being dropped off in a small village Bet Hatikva. Frustrated with circumstances, the band is met with genial hospitality by caf owner Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) who not only feeds them but puts the small band up for the evening.  Dina has eyes for Tewfig and plans an evening out on the town with him - an evening that has its own surprises as each lonely person shares life circumstances.  The other members of the band are placed in lodging with Dina's workers and at a dinner party discover similarities in their lives. Khaled (Saleh Bakri), a somewhat antagonistic ladies' man, spends an evening with a terrified young man Papi (Shlomi Avraham) on his first real date, and in the course of the evening introduces the fine art of courtship to Papi in a hilarious but touching scene.

The use of English as the common language between these Arab and Hebrew speaking people adds elements of humor as well as moments of sweetness as both the band members and the Israelis grow to know and care about each other.  The conversations among each separate group are delivered in Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles and this degree of modified privacy becomes almost more humorous because of the bumpy language barriers shared with the audience.  Everyone grows through this short visit and by the time the band departs for their correct destination by the next morning's bus, bonds have been made that preserve the dignity of nationality while overriding the limitations of differences peculiar to each country.  This is a quiet, gentle, at times very humorous little movie that offers insights of how to attain global community for us all. Writer/director Eran Kolirin deserves special recognition for assembling and molding  this excellent cast for this remarkable, genuinely compassionate statement about important issues.

Since this one-horse town has no hotel, the proprietress of a local diner and some other folks put up the band members for one night until they can catch a bus to the correct destination.  That night challenges them all.

To say that the movie is understated is an understatement in itself.  Ronit Elkabetz is excellent as the smoldering Dina.  But the film moves at a glacial pace that may tax the patience and attention span of many viewers.

Arab and Jew are supposed to be enemies, bit the film is effective in showing that one a person to person level, affinities can overcome these prejudices.",1218240000,4,810,4.551724137931035
3111290,4,B0013HL6ES,"This movie was different from what I expected. I thought it would be faster-paced; a little bit on the edge, perhaps a little controversial.  It was none of these.  Instead, ""The Band's Visit"" is a quiet movie, made great by terrific acting, both by the Israelis and by the Arabs. Each part was played to understated perfection. I also liked the way the director cast very ordinary looking people, some with less than great teeth or bodies, to be the stars of the movie.  In addition, the people in this film seem weighted down by boredom, loneliness or both- just like in real life! But moments of real insight do occur, which make the movie touching and worthwhile.  Watch this movie when you are in a reflective mood, and enjoy!",1217894400,,731,4.6
3111291,5,B0013HL6ES,"Other reviews here detail the story and the plot, so there is no need to repeat that. The Band of Egyptians ends up in a small town (small? I think the population must be less than 100 residents) for the night when they get off at the wrong bus stop and there is only one bus per day.

Originally I though that that it would have the Arabs lost in a big Israeli city with a different culture. But this small town is not the typical Israeli big city with its own cultural prejudices. This two is much more laid back. ""Laid back"" and ""subtle"" are two phrases that constantly came to mind as I viewed this quiet 87-minute gem of a film. No one rushes. There is no loud screaming or yelling. And there are moments when there are no words.

This film is really tri-lingual. Much of the dialogue is in English. When called for, the Israelis speak in Hebrew and the Arabs speak in Arabic. And it's not always consistent. When the dialogue is not in English, there are easy to read English subtitles in yellow. It's interesting that the final credits - which must go on for more than five minutes - are in Hebrew and Arabic with no translation as to which cast members played which roles. You will learn this, however on the 10 minute ""Making of"" featurette that, along with a ""photo gallery"" forms the ""Bonus Features"". There is no commentary. The ""Making of..."" doesn't add much, except to identify the MAJOR cast members.

I agree with the others that the scene at the roller rink is the most memorable one. It really stands out.

This film won lots of awards - and deservedly so - and should attract more fans as it hits DVD shelves later this month.

In three words: I WAS MESMERIZED!

Brilliant Creation! Deserves OSCARS in every single category!",1214870400,3,213,4.3
3111293,5,B0013HL6ES,"I vote for this as one of my favorites of all time. It is as close to a perfect film as I've ever seen, and it is not even in the same dimension of reality as the current crop of movie products with their ear-splitting audio effects that come at you from every side of the cinema, with their special digital enhancement, and with their increasingly tortured and multi-layered plots that remind one of video games.

This film will seem unbearably slow if you are a fan of such current movie spew. If you slow down enough to understand that you are seeing brilliant filmmaking and photography, this is a rewarding two hours. One is struck immediately by the carefully wrought visuals...the sere desert vistas broken by the neon blue of the band members' uniforms. The dialogue is spare; one learns about each character by watching his or her face and movements. The story is straight forward: a small-town Egyptian policemen's band travels to visit a village in Israel to play a concert, when they are misdirected and end up, too late in the day to rectify their mistake, at a village with a similar name, far from their destination. The story takes place during that evening and the next morning.

There are some moments from this film that are etched in my memory...one in a roller-skate disco where the noise from the crowd and the dancers obscures most dialogue. We watch the main characters from across the room and the action is over-the-top hilarious. The small art cinema where I was watching exploded in laughter time and time again, for five minutes.

If you can catch it at a cinema or art theater, do see it there. If not, the DVD will be out soon.",1210636800,3,1658,4.594594594594595
3111294,5,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is 87 minutes of perfection from writer/director Eran Kolirin.  There's little dialogue, accounting in part to language barriers, but more due to the dearth of things to talk about in the forgotten outpost of Beit Hatikva.  Moreover, its residents seem talked-out and beaten down.  Beautiful but weary Dina (the wonderful Ronit Elkabetz) nails the essence of the town's residents when she says that their misdirected Arab guests - looking for the Arab Culture Center - will find ""No Arab culture, no Israeli culture, no culture at all.""

I'm struck by how Kolirin makes those few words matter so much.  Over a dozen scenes are stuck permanently in my head a full month or more after our viewing.  Two scenes in particular stand out:

- An indescribably well-played wordless piece where jazz hipster Haled (Saleh Bakri) leads an inept Papi (Shlomi Avraham) through his first encounter with a girl.  Brilliant direction here by Kolirin.

- A brilliant scene in which band director Tawfiq (regally portrayed by Sasson Gabai) reluctantly reveals the reason behind his romantic reticence.  The core of the scene - when Tawfiq says ""You are a good woman, Dina, I am sure of it"" - elicts a reaction from Ms. Elkabetz bemoaning a life spent worrying about silly things that don't matter now.  It's stirring cinema.

So, now we add ""The Band's Visit"" to my growing list of Israeli films you must see:

3345677,5,B0013HL6ES,"The Band's Visit is well described on Amazon's main page.  An Egyptian band comes to Israel to play at an Arab culture center in a small town.  They arrive at the wrong town and spend the night there, waiting for the next day's bus to take them to their performance site.  In the meantime almost nothing happens, except that the Egyptians and the Israelis learn of their common humanity.  Nothing 'happens', but they learn everything.  The film is sweet, funny, heart-rending at times and cinematically perfect.  Each group has its representative figures, the predictability of the varieties of the human spirit underscoring their true humanity and deep commonality.  The film has been subjected to some political slings and arrows since there are both Israeli and Palestinian actors working together here.  When the director was asked about this, at Ebertfest, he responded that his job is to create art and he has no time for politics such as this.  This was the perfect answer.  The film is deeply 'political' because it is deeply human, something for which the deeply political often have little time.  The performances are very special and the film's warmth and beauty transcends the stark, lonely landscape in which they are revealed.  This little film is now the largest-grossing Israeli film every exhibited in America.  See it.",1209340800,6,1336,5.045662100456621

I don't think the director had ever intended this rather short (and probably low budget) film to be a revelation. But it certainly is... at least, it was for this reviewer. The melancholy wind-swept landscape of an Israeli ""middle of nowhere"" (if such a thing can exist in tiny Israel) serves as a backdrop to the travails of a hapless band of Egyptian police musicians lost on a tour of Israel. Their chance encounters with residents of a desert Israeli town provide us with a low key but profound examination of human vulnerabilities, of the tenderness of our inner souls. And that Dina... Simply superb!",1206748800,5,685,4.764705882352941
3345680,5,B0013HL6ES,"It's hard to imagine that a movie could be made about Arabs and Israelis without offending someone.  ""The Band's Visit"" may accomplish that seemingly impossible task.  Politics are invisible -- and that's one reason the movie is so entertaining.

An aging, ragtag eight-man Egyptian band is stranded in a desolate and dull town in Israel overnight.  Without much in the way of money they depend upon the questionable goodwill of the local Israelis to feed and house them. The interaction between the Egyptians -- formal and dignified -- and the Israelis -- rough and tough, but good-hearted -- is explored slowly and meticulously. There's no excitement here, or flashy scenes.  The movie holds your attention by developing an interest in the characters.  It's amusing but not funny.

In a wonderful scene, for example, the neer-do-well of the band, a handsome young womanizer, teaches a painfully shy young Israeli boy how to romance his equally shy girl friend at a roller rink.

You wonder throughout the movie when the band is going to play music. Be patient.  It does -- in the genre of classical Arab music, or so I understand.

3345681,4,B0013HL6ES,"The Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra gets lost in Israel. After taking a wrong bus from the airport, this small police band from Egypt is stranded at a small, sleepy town in Israel. Tired and hungry, eight members of the band all clad in light-blue uniform decide to stay overnight at the place. Using this simple story, Israeli-born director Eran Kolirin (his feature film debut) has made a very amusing and charming film.

Israel-France-US film ""The Band's Visit"" relates a set of episodes about the band's members and the local residents. Nothing big happens here, just small things that happen between Israeli hosts and Egyptian guests, but all these small things matter in ""The Bands Visit,"" a bitter-sweet tale that will make you smile in a traditional way, without being too political.

The most impressive part for me is about the band's rigid and stoic conductor Tawfiq (Sasson Gabai) and the restaurant owner Dina (Ronit Elkabetz), who is also an attractive woman (in red dress). Difficulties of communication still lie between them when he reluctantly accepts her invitation to dinner, but they slowly begin to reveal what is hidden deep in their heart to one another (and us) - after all Tawfiq may not be the only one who has been left stranded at this quiet town. The excellent performances from Sasson Gabai and Ronit Elkabetz are really fantastic.

Another memorable episode is an equally charming and almost silent one. It happens at the roller disco scene where one of the band's younger members teaches a timid local boy how to seduce a girl. It is a little gem and you have to see it for yourself to understand that sometimes silence is the best way to tell a good story.

The theme of the film may not be particularly new, and it must be said that this quiet film may require patience for some viewers. Still with the great performances from the cast ""The Band's Visit"" is a lovely little film with genuinely magical moments.",1202947200,20,1952,4.817910447761194

3345699,2,B0013HL6ES,"It would be great to have more movies about Arabs and Israelis mixing it up, accidentally or otherwise, but why insist on boring us to death?  The beginning scene of a town in the middle of nowhere with no movement or talk was enough to get that idea across.  Hurry up after that -- if you have anything to say or offer in a movie....move!  I think the director must have overemphasized BOREDOM to the actors and literally FORCED dead time on each and every scene -- unnaturally. Communicating the presence of boredom in the location is different from boring the audience to death thorough-out a movie. Plot, universal themes, change, are required for art

Rich people like to visit poor towns and then leave after a few hours saying ""how touching, how moving..."" They feel good for visiting.  It is not OK to leave things like that in a artistic work.  We don't go to movies and fiction for that kind of dead end.  The idea of bringing the Alexandria police band to this dried out Israeli town was good. The authenticity of the the people was good.  But you still have to DO something with the material and work to improve what develops:

For example, the ""general"" could have shared his guilt over his son's suicide and wife's broken heart WHILE they were on the bench and the woman could have asked how he knew it was his fault, and whether there may be other factors that contributed to the suicide, challenging his stuckness...This would have brought in  the real poverty underlying his life....his choice of music as an outlet..a choice in his life that no doubt brought both good and bad....a moment of awareness, perhaps even an element of self-forgiveness...

The woman was a good actress but she could have started out more antagonistic toward Arab visitors then been changed forever by her encounter (yes, FOREVER, why not? Is that too unsophisticated? Impossible for poor people?)...her pain from the general's rejection could have been shown, quickly, sensitively, as motivation for her behavior: that is, her having desperate sex with the young man.  Instead the sex comes across as simply tawdry and low-life, cynical without human feeling or human awareness.

A few changes and a little honest speech and immediately more depth and a solid movie.  Instead the film maker insists on deadness, boredom, failure, brokenness, END OF STORY.

More music...more, Arabic or Middle Eastern  music, easily added, would have improved the movie tenfold.  The last song sung by the general was utterly fantastic..I was so hungry for it by the end.  Again why why why bore us to death until this last performance of the band? The theme of the movie should have been the universality of music. Emphasize boredom in the music if you insist, but the music could carry the magically sustenance of the blues.

The movie's awards are feel-good trophies.  I hate being fooled by that kind of thing.  Awards resting on political feel-good should be distinguished as such so that we know what're paying for.  Make a politically liberal feel-good movie, but it must be art too.",1456617600,,3069,4.816793893129771

They've arrived on the last bus of the day, and the woman who runs the local caf agrees to put them up for the night at her home as well as the home of a friend. They can communicate only in English, because the Egyptians speak Arab and the Israelis speak Hebrew. The stiff, unemotional band leader, Tewfiq, keeps a tight rein on the 7 other band members, most of whom remain silent and stiff in the bright blue uniforms.

The band members communicate awkwardly with the locals, but through a long evening, they manage to break down some cultural barriers and open up to each other a bit. Dina, the caf owner, is lonely and stifled in this tiny town and tries to reach out to Tewfiq, but he can't really loosen his tie and get to know each other in the way she really wants.

3345734,5,B0013HL6ES,"'It's the wrong time and the wrong place...' - there are so many excerpts of songs quoted in this movie and ones that stimulate memories of old songs that are very much in keeping with the title and the story, THE BAND'S VISIT (BIKUR HA-TIZMORET). A timely piece, this little film is about humanity and the possibility of communication by various means that overcome differences between cultures far better than treaties, summit meetings, and physical and verbal demonstrations. It is a thoughtful, engaging, and completely delightful success.

The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra with 'General' Tewfiq (Sasson Gabai) rigidly in charge provides music for occasions, and the particular occasion for this venture is a ceremony in Israel. Flying in from Egypt well dressed in light blue uniforms to perform for the new Arab Culture Center, the small band is not met as expected at the airport. Tewfiq attempts to resolve the lack of proper greeting and transportation by reserving space on a bus - a trip that mistakenly (through problems originating in language confusion) results in the band being dropped off in a small village Bet Hatikva. Frustrated with circumstances, the band is met with genial hospitality by caf owner Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) who not only feeds them but puts the small band up for the evening. Dina has eyes for Tewfig and plans an evening out on the town with him - an evening that has its own surprises as each lonely person shares life circumstances. The other members of the band are placed in lodging with Dina's workers and at a dinner party discover similarities in their lives. Khaled (Saleh Bakri), a somewhat antagonistic ladies' man, spends an evening with a terrified young man Papi (Shlomi Avraham) on his first real date, and in the course of the evening introduces the fine art of courtship to Papi in a hilarious but touching scene.

The use of English as the common language between these Arab and Hebrew speaking people adds elements of humor as well as moments of sweetness as both the band members and the Israelis grow to know and care about each other. The conversations among each separate group are delivered in Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles and this degree of modified privacy becomes almost more humorous because of the bumpy language barriers shared with the audience. Everyone grows through this short visit and by the time the band departs for their correct destination by the next morning's bus, bonds have been made that preserve the dignity of nationality while overriding the limitations of differences peculiar to each country. This is a quiet, gentle, at times very humorous little movie that offers insights of how to attain global community for us all. Writer/director Eran Kolirin deserves special recognition for assembling and molding this excellent cast for this remarkable, genuinely compassionate statement about important issues.

3345735,5,B0013HL6ES,"The Band's Visit is a little masterpiece by Eran Kolirin who both wrote the script and directed the film. On the surface, there are gaps of silence that make the plot appear slow moving but in actuality the silence mixed with the dialogue makes for a powerful statement about humanity in general and how people can relate to one another even when they have been enemies much, much longer than they have been on somewhat friendly terms. The casting was very well done and the acting, often by relatively unknown actors, is completely convincing and memorable at once. The cinematography and the choreography work well and the musical score enhances the film.

When the film starts, we quickly meet members of The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra who have traveled from Egypt to Israel to play at the opening of an Arabic cultural center. Unfortunately for the members of the band, they arrive without anyone to welcome them--and thanks to the stubborn pride of uptight, repressed band leader Lieutenant-Colonel Tawfiq Zacharya (Sasson Gabai) who refuses to ask for help they go by bus to a remote Israeli town of Beit Hatikva instead of Petah Tiqva after womanizing band member Haled (Saleh Bakri) gets the wrong directions at a bus terminal because of a language gap.

The band meets the owner of a small restaurant in Beit Hatikva, Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) and her friends Papi (Shlomi Avraham) and Itzik (Rubi Moskovitz). Tawfiq feels very awkward but the band members are hungry and so he asks Dina for some food. Dina, who tries to hide her loneliness by acting very self-confident and even bouncy at times, gives in and feeds them--and, because there are no more buses that night, arranges for the band members to spend the night in her home and Itzik's home; the band will be able to continue on to Petah Tiqva the following morning. This is much to Itzik's chagrin because it's his wife Iris' birthday; but Dina puts her foot down and the band members stay.

Of course there's more to the plot and I've already left out some of the details. Look for what happens when Papi goes out for a night of partying with his blind date Yula (Rinat Matatov) while Haled very kindly gives Papi tips on how to attract women. Meanwhile, Dina and Tawfiq go out on a casual date. In addition, there is band member Simon (Khalifa Natour) who sometimes conducts the orchestra and is working on his ""concerto;"" and Uri Gavriel gives a great performance as Avrum. We learn so much about these characters and the others during the course of the evening especially as the Israelis and Egyptians try their best to communicate using English; it's all a poignant slice of life.

The DVD comes with a bonus featurette on how they made the movie; this includes brief but insightful interviews with the principle members of the cast.

The Band's Visit is a work of art that highlights how people of different cultures discover they are more similar than not when they have to spend some time together.

3345737,5,B0013HL6ES,"This is a film about the complications around behaving with decency. It is cinematic story telling at its best. It is a simple enough story, a brass band commissioned to play at a ceremony. The difference is it involves an Egyptian police band playing in Israel. Due to a stuff up, they are left stranded at the airport, but resourceful, they make their own way to where they are supposed to play. From there it is about trying to honour the gig and the interplay of the different personalities in the band and the Israelis they meet. It is a series of interactions of worlds interacting that would otherwise not have ever had contact with one another. It brims with humanity. It is remarkably lacking in judgements. Overall, it gives five stars for humanity when we share a common decency, when we are prepared to communicate across the deepest gulf and share what we have in common.",1350000000,,884,4.6369426751592355

They have taken the wrong bus and another bus will not come until tomorrow.  Across the street is a small cafe, evidently the only business in town. Regarding them are two bored layabouts and a sad, darkly beautiful woman.  They feed the Egyptian men and put them up for the night.

3345740,4,B0013HL6ES,"I made a New Year's Resolution this year to watch a movie each from the four world regions I had never seen a movie from. One of them was the Middle East, so I chose ""The Band's Visit,"" which was at the library where I go to college. I was expecting a low key, slow-paced film with a few chuckles, and that was just what I got. However, I also got more: the movie has some interesting thoughts about music, I really related to the main character, Tawfiq, and I enjoyed the music in the movie. It's unassuming and tells a very simple story, which is part of its appeal. The tone reminded me a little bit of the German film ""Schultze gets the blues,"" in that both are about music, culture clash, and don't try to do anything except simply tell a story. The acting is very good in The Band's Visit, and there are touching moments as well as funny ones. It also captivated me because it showed me something new - everyone in the movie is Semitic, and it is my first Middle Eastern movie. Being a language major, I also found it interesting that the Egyptians spoke Arabic amongst themselves and the Israelis spoke Hebrew amongst themselves, but they spoke English to each other. In other words, it was interesting to hear my own language used so much in a film made in such a distant place. The Band's Visit also showed that Middle Eastern people have a lot of the same things that we have in America. I wasn't expecting a skating rink to be in rural Israel, but I can't say I've ever thought about it, either. If you like music and straightforward movies, and especially if you like both, I recommend The Band's Visit.",1332720000,,1615,4.368770764119601

3345742,5,B0013HL6ES,"This delightful gem contains a subtle and powerfully moving tale of how, underneath our differences, we all carry the same sense of loss and hope, sadness and joy.

At times, there were gentle moments so poignantly funny, we weren't sure whether to laugh or cry!

The cast of actors was superb. While all the actors, to the briefest comic appearance (such as the airport cleaner), were excellent, the performance by Sasson Gabai as Lieutenant-Colonel Tawfiq Zacharya was simply superb. Ronit Elkabetz as the kind-hearted, lively but lonely Dina refusing to wilt in her bleak Isreali settlement town, also turned in an outstanding performance (coming close to her brilliant rendition of Ruthie in ""Or, My Treasure"".)

The story of The Band's Visit is of a police band who somehow end up one town over from where they are supposed to be for a concert the following night. The movie thus revolves around this one night stuck in a very (and I do mean ""very"") sleepy outpost in Israel.

Filled with excellent acting performances from all concerned, the director also understands it's not necessary to fill up the movie with dialogue. Much of it is in Hebrew or Arabic with broken English bridging the gap (and this is broken English that seems quite natural among people who would obviously not be fluent give their circumstances and background). The situations are simply delightful and have an almost Napoleon Dynamite quality to them from the visit to a local roller rink to the two main actors visit to a ""park.""

It's definitely a movie that is much more than the sum of its parts. It touches on how life can bring the strangest of bedfellows together in ways that give us all hope that no matter how simple a town may seem, it is filled with people who have stories to tell.

3345747,2,B0013HL6ES,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

This low key ""dramedy"" from Israel is about a police band from Alexandria, Egypt scheduled to play at an Arab Cultural Center in a particular Israeli town. They end up in the wrong town and spend the night as guests of a single Israeli woman and a young married Israeli man. Although the band consists of eight men, the screenwriter fleshes out only three of them.

The main character is the band's leader, Tawfiq who mainly interacts with the film's protagonist, Dina, the single Israeli woman who tries to make the best of life in what she considers a boring town. There's also Khaled, the youngest member of the band who goes into town with a young Israeli guy and ends up coaching him on how to be more successful with woman. And finally there's Simon, who ends up playing his unfinished ""concerto"" for Itzik, the young Israeli married man trapped in an unhappy marriage. The movie tries to stress the common humanity of both the Israelis and the Egyptians as they awkwardly interact with one another. The only two characters who rise above sentimental stereotypes are Tawfiq and Dina. Tawfiq is first introduced as being a bit of an authoritarian, especially how he won't allow Simon to conduct the band and orders Khaled around as if he's a child. But later, Dina brings out Tawfiq's softer side when he confesses that his son committed suicide and his wife died of a broken heart; revealing that it was his own heavy handed methods of child-rearing that led to the son's suicide. One wonders what causes Tawfiq to be so impressed with Dina. She confesses while they have coffee in a diner that she's having an affair with a married man. Later at the end of the film, Tawfiq gets up in the middle of the night and overhears Dina and Khaled having sex. Nonetheless, he thanks Dina for her hospitality when the group leaves the next morning.

Dina is impressive as a world weary single still looking for love but again I question how she was able to open up shy Tawfiq in the space of one night. Khaled isn't all that believable as both ""love counselor"" and rebellious band member. Beyond the little comic moment when he shows Papi how to be successful with women at the skating rink, a few moments of tension with Tawfiq and the fleeting glance of him having sex with Dina, we don't find out much more about him. Even worse is Simon and Itzik who bond over Simon's unfinished musical composition. Itzik has a few comic lines about the difficulties of his marriage and Simon has nothing more to do than his play his clarinet. The other band members are mainly content to remain silent and let the three principals do the talking.

Much of the conflict between the characters in this film is too ""soft"". It allows the filmmaker to suggest that Arabs and Israelis can overcome their differences since they are so alike. But people are more complex and the screenwriter fails to give his characters enough nuances and enough conflict for this drama to work on a deeper level.

Nonetheless, the film keeps one's interest to the end and there are enough revelations (albeit underdeveloped) that make this film worthwhile seeing.",1286841600,2,3169,4.672043010752688
3345748,4,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is an unusual film.  Gentle, warm, insightful but never reaching to great heights.  This is a pity.  I believe it had much to offer.  It somehow failed to convince in the end.

Briefly, the film covers the visit to Israel by the Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra.  They are due to play at the Arab Cultural Centre in an Israeli town but manage to catch the wrong bus.  They end up in a boring little town in the desert.  They are lost and out place.  It is how the band interacts with the locals that is the basis of the film.

I suspect that many might think that an Egyptian orchestra in Israel would be the setting for hostility.  Rather, the two sets of people seem to get on well.  They are both tolerant and patient.  The film succeeds in bringing this relationship to life.  Unfortunately, it does little else.  The film is a study of reactions between two peoples.

The acting by the cast of relative unknowns is excellent.  Hollywood should take a hint.  Big names don't necessarily make great films.  Yet, for all its charm (and it has this in bucket loads), the film fails to compel.  It needs something more than just a study of characters.  It seems to meander at times.  It lacks a plot.  Put simply, there is something missing.  This is a shame.  The film has much to offer.  It could have been great but fails to make the final step.",1279929600,,1373,4.413654618473895
3345749,4,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is a charming, small film about misplaced people in foreign cultures that manages to have no overbearing message other than we're often more common than we want to think we are. After a language issues accidentally diverts the eight member Egyptian Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra to the middle of nowhere, they have to depends, warily, on the kindness of Israeli strangers. The Israelis, led by free-spirited Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) separate the band between three families, the staid leader of the orchestra, General Tewfiq (Sasson Gabai) winds up with her.

Little scenarios come up that are more gentle than caustic in their conflict, and are often humorous, sometime melancholy. The scene where ladies man Khaled (Saleh Bakri) coaches the shy Papi at the roller-rink in the fine art of the Pick Up is hilarious. The scene where the frustrated composer Simon and his host Itzik dwell over lost idealism is sadly touching. But none of these scenes is forced or exploitative, while they've had the power to stay in my memory for quite some time. Watching Tewfiq attempt to explain music with his conductor's gestures alone made me love this film, and I recommend it highly for those who don't mind spending time with a movie that opens itself up gradually without banging you over the head.",1279411200,,1316,5.0091324200913245

3345752,5,B0013HL6ES,"Unfortunately it seems that most of the reviewers have missed the point of this film- which is understandable, as when I initially first saw it, I missed the point too. It's very subtly expressed
and depends on an insider's understanding of Israeli society.

Expecting a tale of cultural rapprochement, of an underlying common humanity despite cultural differences, I was disappointed to find precious little bridge building taking place. I kept waiting for the moment of enlightenment, the turning point, a climax which never came, not even in the final sexual encounter. I left wondering what the point was.

Upon analysis, I realize that the film is not about Egyptians and Israelis meeting each other, and reaching accross cultural difference. The film is about Israelis looking for a part of themselves that has been lost.

The first clue is the location of the fictional town of Bet Hatikva: A dusty desert town in the Negev. The type of town that would have been initially settled by North African Jews, the parents and grandparents of the film participants. So we are not talking about people from accross cultures; we are talking about people from nearly the exact same culture! How did such a gap develop?

The second clue is language: The film was not admitted to the foreign language competition because too much of the dialogue was in English. But why are the Egyptians and Israelis speaking English to each other? This is not just a political statement- that neighboring countries don't know each other's language. This goes beyond that, if you realize that ARABIC was the first language of the parents of the Israeli film participants. Remember how Dina recalls how the whole neighborhood used to shut down while everyone watched Arab movies on TV? But now, they cant speak a word of arabic.

The cultured Egyptian band members contrast markedly with the Israelis. How did these Jews wind up with ""No Arab culture, no Israeli culture, no culture at all""??? Upon meeting the Egyptians, the Israelis sense a shadow of their lost selves, and sense a longing to fill it.  Dina is not just a desperate divorcee looking to bed an exotic stranger in uniform. She seeks a lost part of herself, and she seeks in sex, what she failed to accomplish in speech and in deed.

In an ironic twist, the film reverses the mythical role of the Jews in the world: In the diaspora the Jews were the wandering, the homeless, the sojourners who birthed two great religions and in many other ways imparted culture to their host societies. But in their homeland, in this little town of Bet Hatikva,  it is the wandering Egyptians who arrive bearing culture, from their music to their guidance in matters of romance.

This is a film about Jews in search of themselves in the aftermath of cultural upheaval, in my opinion an unacknowledged source of many social tensions (class, ethnic, religious) in modern Israel today.",1277510400,5,2909,4.872469635627531

In Eran Kolirin`s stripped-down and understated human comedy ""The Band's Visit,"" a small orchestra made up of eight uniformed Egyptian policemen travels to Israel as part of a cultural-exchange program.  Thanks to a scheduling snafu, the band members find themselves stranded in a tiny village in the Negev Desert where they are looked after by a kind and attractive restaurateur (the luminous Ronit Elkabetz) and one of her friends who agree to put the men up for the night.  The musicians include a crusty old conductor, played by the marvelously deadpan Sasson Gabai, and a handsome young womanizer and trumpet player (Saleh Bakri) who don't exactly see eye-to-eye on much concerning either music or life.

Like many such films from abroad, ""The Band's Visit"" eschews obvious narrative flourishes in favor of a more slice-of-life approach to storytelling - indeed, almost to a fault in the case of this particular film.  Yet, while there are times when the movie's ""smallness"" is of so determined and deliberate a nature that it begins to border on the self-conscious, ""The Band's Visit"" finds its truths in the minutiae of everyday life, in the heartfelt exchanges between characters (particularly between Gabai and Elkabetz), and in the way it acknowledges the commonality of the human condition.  The people in the film may come from different - even antagonistic - cultures, but they are quick to discover that there is far more that unites them than divides them in the grander scheme of things.

Coming in at a brief 86-minute running time, ""The Band's Visit"" is a mere vignette in what is obviously a larger tale of Egypt/Israel relations, one that makes its case for cooperation among all the world's peoples without undue fuss or fanfare.",1269734400,5,1758,5.041379310344827

The slow pace of the film was appealing, but the lack of any kind of redemption in the characters wasn't. Everyone acted just as you expected they would... there wasn't even any political or social commentary (unless the producer wants to point out that Israeli women are either harpies or sluts) there were no surprises and therefore no redemption in this film and I was very disappointed.

Somehow their connections get mixed up and they end up stranded in the middle of nowhere in Israel. The picture of the eight of them in their formal powder blue uniforms against the stark desert landscape says it all. They're lost. What happens next is not a summit meeting that will solve all the Israeli-Palestinian issues but it does show how, as human beings, we all share similar stories in this journey called life. The story centers on three main people, the very stern, rigid leader of the band, a young free-spirited ladies man in the band and a middle aged woman who runs a deli and agrees to put the band up for the night since there is no hotel and the last bus for the day has left. Both the woman and the band leader open up to each other in ways they would never have expected at the beginning of that day. This is a delightful little story that reminds us that some of the best moments in life can be the unplanned ones, the interruptions that are initially very frustrating but can be life changing or, at least, very influential. Like having a flat tire in the middle of nowhere and a stranger stops to help. Though this movie does not attempt to solve any of the world's big problems, it does remind one that, as humans, we forget that we have more in common than we realize. While world leaders may use angry rhetoric and accusations, the vast majority of the world wants to learn to get along even with those we may call 'enemies'.

A lyric comedy of Egyptian policemen found themself in a strange environment of a semi-hostile country, surviving on mercy of ordinary Israeli-Jewish generosity, having in common with the Jews much more than, according to media, mullahs and politicians round a world assert.

Perhaps, pro-Western female emancipation itself is a very different experience for a male-dominated culture Arab guys used usually to and constitutes a very line of a story telling humoristically of inter-national grassroot human bridges possible and occurring with English only by singing American melodies and mentioning American musicians.

The story is about an Egyptian Police Band that is supposed to do a performance at the opening of a new Egyptian Cultural Center in Israel.  One of the band's members asks for directions to the city and mispronounces the Hebrew word for the town.  Thus, the misadventures start.

The band ends up in a small town in the middle of nowhere.  It is certainly not a place of any culture says the woman who runs the restaurant where their bus lets them off.

This comedic and poignant film unfolds duing a period of little more than 24 hours, until the band can catch the next bus to the right place.  We see lust, love, pain, grief and hope.  We laugh a lot. I guffawed a few times. We are witness to how people learn to accept one another and go past their prior negative feelings.

3345765,5,B0013HL6ES,"... and I'm an easy mark for slow movies! Most of my favorites are slow, sly, and understated - Wild Strawberries, Babette's Feast, Ikiru, for examples. ""The Band's Visit"" isn't quite that good, but it's one of the most intelligently slow films I've seen recently. The redoubtable Grady Harp has done a competent job of summarizing the action and introducing the characters, leaving me free to be tangential. Being tangential goes hand in glove with loving slow movies, and The Band's Visit is one huge tangent on the insanity of the Arab-Israeli hate fest. The very ordinary Israelis and the quirky but also ordinary Egyptians in this film show an ability to accept each other's humanity that would win them all Nobel Peace Prizes if they were in charge of anything.

""The Band's Visit"" is also wryly funny. Not the loud guffaw kind of funny. Mostly the tightly engaged chuckle kind of funny, though a few scenes brought audible whoops from my teenage son. And it's sad. Yes, very sad. The two principal characters -- the widowed Egytian bandmaster and the divorced Israeli 'woman of a certain age' -- are too real not to be sad. Two more disparate humans couldn't be found on the planet, and yet they emerge with a sincere appreciation of each other. The acting, by the way, in this film is so natural and and crafty that one has to pinch oneself to remember that 'they' were acting. Perhaps that's why so many reviewers have stopped at four stars in their ratings; the artfulness of this movie is so understated and sly that the viewers forget they're watching a film, an artifact of cameras and cutting rooms. This film deserved all the various industry awards that it received from people who appreciate their art.",1234137600,,1719,4.749163879598663
3345766,5,B0013HL6ES,"If you like slapstick humor, or if you think TV sit-coms are funny, you probably won't like this movie.  The humor in this movie is much more sophisticated.  One scene was particularly funny when one of the band members, who viewed himself as quite a ladies man, was coaching one of the Jewish men, who was painfully shy with women.  Like all the humor in this movie, it is dead-pan humor.  The band leader never cracks a smile because he takes everything so seriously; but the situations he encounters are very funny.  This movie uses humor to show the universality of the human experience, and that it can overcome political differences.  The movie works because it is an Egyptian band, a country at peace with Israel; I don't think it would work if it was an Hamas or Palestinian band.  One other aspect I found interesting was that when the Hebrew speaking Jews talked directly to the Arabic speaking Egyptians, they used English! - [So, it is not all subtitled, although you might want to use closed captioning because of their accents.]

It is a shame that several reviewers here have such an immature understanding of humor that they can't get past the TV humor that is so stupid or put-down that they have to put in a laugh track to let people know when to laugh.  This movie is for those with a mature sense of humor.",1233532800,,1326,4.53781512605042
3345767,5,B0013HL6ES,"When the blue-uniformed Egyptian police band 'The Alexandria Ceremonial Orchestra' gets lost in small town Israel on its way to an Arab cultural centre, it sets the scene for personal and ideological differences to be tested and turned around - and the results are both achingly funny and truly life-affirming. ""The Band's Visit"" has clocked up over 35 International awards and having enjoyed every rather lovely and quirky minute of it, I can easily see why it's captured the hearts of so many.

Tewfiq - the regimental, guarded and awkward 65-year old bandleader - is played with truly stunning restraint by veteran Arab actor SASSON GABAI - who in turns strikes up an unlikely relationship with the town's feisty and vibrant 35-year old caf owner Dina - played with relish and gusto by the gorgeous RONIT ELKABETZ - an actress who lights up the screen every second she's on it. This woman has a choker of gold around her ankle and her toenails are painted - any interesting man who comes to her 'dead' town had better watch out. Tewfiq is an interesting man - despite their huge age difference. But he's also the sort of old school gentleman who will open a door for a lady, but won't answer her probing personal questions - even if love 'is' on the cards...

The orchestra of 8 has its youngest member in the womanizing romantic that is Halib - played by the handsome SALEH BAKRI. The scene where he sings ""My Funny Valentine"" to a pretty receptionist behind a glass protection panel at the airport is both hilarious and touching.

In some respects not a lot happens in ""The Band's Visit"" - hours pass, backgammon is played, roads lined with thousands of overhanging streetlights stretch out for miles in either direction without a car every bothering the shimmering tarmac. A fork falls on the kitchen floor, someone clips a moustache, a hat is hung over a picture of a tank so as not to offend. But then - against all this boredom and monochrome existence - you're hit with scenes of unexpected tenderness. There's a local lad waiting all night by the town callbox for his girlfriend to call. The shy and awkward band member played superbly by KHALIFA MATOUR sitting on the bed of the family who have offered him overnight accommodation; he's watching their baby boy sleep - when he suddenly gets the notes in his head to finish that concerto for clarinet he's been writing, but sadly never finished. His face as he realizes his dream. Or in the local dancehall - where the impossibly awkward and shy lad Papi - who wants an equally awkward and shy girl - is helped by the woman-knowing Halib. It's as funny and as tender as cinema gets - truly fantastic stuff.

Alongside the silences is the other character - Music - and its ability to break down barriers, bring people together, dissipate awkward situations. It features heavily throughout the film and it gives the piece its emotional heart. The father of the family who sings Gershwin's ""Summertime"" at the dinner table and all the religions join in; the pop music on the radio in the car breaking the silence for the youngsters as they drive through Saturday night; the band practising an Arabic lullaby in the warm evening air outside the town caf...

But there's better than that. There are about five scenes with Tewfiq and Dina where their discussions about men and women and marriage and children - are just electrifying - and its easy to see why so many of those International Film Awards were for the screenplay which the Writer/Director ERAN KOLIRIN freely admits took 9 years to perfect. Dina is lonely despite her vivaciousness and Tewfiq has deep hidden pain. When Gabai and Elkabetz are together, they're dialogue and interaction really are something else - both of them rising to the great material. (His discussion about fishing being the most 'important thing in the world' gives this review its title).

If you were to highlight downsides, they'd only be minor niggles - the entire end credits rolling up in front of you are in Arabic and not in English so you can't understand a single word - nor know who did what. And in the Special Features Section - the Photo Gallery pictures many of the actors without telling us Westerners who they are. Sloppy. However, these are countered by a lovely 20-minute ""Making Of The Fairy Tale"" featurette, which has interviews with the director, the traditional/modern music editor HABIB SHADAD and the principal actors - and is both warm and very illuminating.

With Arabs and Jews, Palestinian and Israeli artists all making this movie together - ""The Band's Visit"" is Israeli cinema coming of age and something of a cultural milestone. It's about music and love and made with the same. Eran Kolirin has produced a little gem out of all that political mayhem and personal demarcation - and he and his crew should be rightly proud of it.

Like ""Caramel"" and ""The Namesake"", this is a foreign film that does not dwell on the extinction of life, but the living of it. I was deeply moved.

Put ""Bikur Ha-Tizmoret"" or ""The Band's Visit"" high on your rental/to buy list - highly recommended.",1233273600,,5102,4.736486486486487

Stranded in the city with limited resources and no translators, the band is left to their own devices for food, and overnight sleep.  This is where the hearwarming part of the movie starts.  Locals unaccustomed to any visitors, open their hearts and homes to these strangers.  Simple show of kindness such as giving them food and a bed to sleep opens up everyone involved in the deeper reflection about their own lives, their purpose, about the art and about meaning of family and community.  One cannot help but laugh about universal domestic bickering; understanding about strain unemployment brings to a young family; heartbreak about loneliness and despair; universal need for love and understanding.

An Egyptian Police Ceremonial Band, played mostly by Palestinian actors, ends up in the wrong town on their way to an Arab cultural center opening.  As they emerge from the bus, they are in a remote Israeli town, with no bus out until the next morning, no hotel in town, presumably no other Arabs in town, and essentially no money.

The band is led by a very stiff ""General"" who is now forced to depend upon the kindness of strangers in looking after his charges, until the next bus out of town the next day.

Although it could have been a mindless comedy, the film takes a very serious approach to character development and depicting the interaction of the two cultures, resulting in many intensely humorous moments.

All the main characters are touched by the meeting of these two cultures and groups of peoples, and changed by it in positive ways.

The movie's humanity and love characterize it, and give us all hope for greater interaction between Arabs and Israelis along a similar vein, allowing such a recipe to emerge again, and again.

3345771,5,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is a charming, gentle, low-key art film telling the tale of a  touring Egyptian police band that finds itself stranded in a podunk town in the Israeli desert. Short on cash and having missed the last bus of the days, the forlorn Egyptians are forced to rely on the kindness of strangers -- in this case, the same Israelis who they have recently been at war with. But the Israelis are every bit as forlorn as the Egyptians -- everybody's a little bit broken inside, struggling with the same little lonelinesses and discarded hopes. The two groups don't entirely bridge their cultural gap, but they come pretty close. This is a very deliberate, quiet film -- some may find the pacing a bit glacial, but it certainly pays of in the end. Definitely worth checking out!

3345772,4,B0013HL6ES,"The Band's Visit (2007) aka Bikur Ha-Tizmoret (2007), the directorial debut of Erin Kolirin, is the winner of three 2007 Cannes Festival's awards and 8 Awards of Israeli Academy of Film. Even though its subject, the relations between Jews and Arabs, is complex and controversial, the movie is gentle, sweet, hopeful, optimistic, a little sad, and well worth of seeing. The movie tells about the Egyptian policemen-musicians, the members of the Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra and how they arrived to Israel one day to play at the opening of the Arab Cultural Center in Pet Hatikvah. Somehow, no one met them at the airport, and they took the bus that got them to the small town or rather village of Bet Hatikvah, in the middle of nowhere, or to be precise, somewhere in Negev desert. The musicians with their instruments wearing sky-blue uniforms stuck in Bet Hatikvah for the night because the right bus only comes once a day. How Egyptians and Jews communicate during that night, how they impact one another, what they learn about complete strangers and about themselves - makes the simple but very real and very hopeful story. The film is minimalistic, it does not use special effects or many words but it managed to tell us something important about these people by looking closely at their faces, observing their body language, sympathizing with them. You know, it is so good to see or a chance a movie with no villains, chases, guns, predictable situations, obligatory affairs, etc. It is really nice to be able to get drawn inside the movie, to feel like you've met good friends, not perfect or heroic, sometimes shy and awkward, but real and interesting to us. Two main characters as played by very good Israeli actors who are terrific in their riles and I'd love to see them getting international acclaim. Ronit Elkabeth is stunning - I could not take off my eyes off her face. Intense, passionate, sexy, three times winner of Israel Academy awards for acting, actress/director/writer, she is a national treasure. Sasson Gabai, who is apparently famous in Israel but not outside the country, was also outstanding as the repressed and shy leader of the band, Lieutenant-colonel Tawfiq Zacharya. With the running time only 87 minutes, The Band's Visit is one of the best and most memorable films from last year.

3345773,5,B0013HL6ES,"Good writing, it has been argued, demands a keen sense of what to leave out. This remarkable film excels in its choice of what to omit.

Never before in viewing a film have I so strongly felt the presence of matters off-screen. This film, I believe, is nothing less than a  profound fable about the whole of relations between the Arab and Israeli worlds. Remarkably what triumphs here is the humanity of each culture. Each is heroic; each is humane.

Sadly, there is never peacefulness, just tension never resolved; sadly, there is never triumph, just accomodation. There is an aching sadness throughout the film--there has been loss; there still is loss, there will always be loss. Throughout the film--especially in the silent moments (where I swear you hear the voices of Jewish and Muslim dead) and especially in the memorable shots of empty landscapes and ruminative shots of main characters--which never seem to fully fill the camera frame (where I swear you see the ghosts of Arab and Israeli dead)--there is the weight of a ruinous past, a troubled present, an unresolved future.

3345775,4,B0013HL6ES,"Like the utterly different Paradise Now, The Band's Visit finds the complex humans behind the popular dichotomies of the Middle East.  A budget-pressed Egyptian police band, still resplendent in their (as one character says) ""Michael Jackson"" uniforms arrives in Israel, is not met by their sponsors, takes travel matters into their own hands, and winds up lost and nearly without money in the most dreary desert town this side of Wristcutters: A Love Story.  The band is hungry; its straitlaced director approaches the restaurant owner, Dina, and asks for food and the chance to pay with Egyptian money.  She prepares a meal and, after telling them there is no hotel in town, invites them to stay in her home and that of her unemployed friend with marriage problems and a wife's birthday.

And so the bare desert stage is set for a singular night.  Among the many quiet, amusing and lonely vignettes:  the band director, Tewfiq, reveals his personal sadness to Dina in a concrete plaza as they listen to an imaginary sea; a band member unconsciously wipes out a glass as if in a dubious restaurant, except he's sitting at table with his Israeli hosts; and -- best of all -- the band's ladies man gives dating help in a roller rink to a painfully shy Israeli.

Day comes, the band moves on to its correct destination, and plays.  Life returns to normal, but normal for the dozen characters in The Band's Visit has been forever, if only slightly, altered.",1224720000,,1454,4.764940239043825

However, for those of you who intensely dislike subtitles, almost all the dialog is in English as it's the only language the Egyptians and Israelis share. A small Egyptian Police orchestra is sent to Israel on a cultural exchange program, but gets badly lost due to the differences between Arabic and Hebrew. The band director sends the youngest member of the group to the bus ticket booth, but he's too busy flirting with the pretty vendor to pay much attention to what she's actually saying. In Arabic the letter P doesn't exist, so Arabs usually say B instead as in Bebsi Cola. So instead of going to Petah Tikva, just outside of Tel Aviv, they wind up going to a small isolated desert town, Bet Hatikva where they quickly become stranded. Although both sides are immediately suspicious of each other, the townsfolk take them in and give them food and shelter for the night, and over time the two groups find they have more in common individually and culturally than either imagines. Every thing is low key, and while there's quite a bit of humor throughout, it's not really at anyone's expense.

It turns out to be an almost deserted, run-down hole in the ground somewhere in the desert where, as one character says, there is no Arab culture, no Israeli culture, no culture at all.
  The movie traces the interaction of the band members with some of the locals who offer them hospitality. Little by little, we learn about these characters -- their frustrated hopes and hidden sorrows. Divided by language and culture, they manage to find common ground in some of the small details of daily life.
  This is a quiet, restrained movie which makes its points subtly, without blaring them. It is also a movie, made through cooperation of Israeli Jewish and Palestinian actors, from which politics is entirely absent. These people don't have the time or energy to fight out the Middle East peace process -- they are too busy trying to get through their tough and unsatisfying lives with some dignity intact.
  Visually this movie was a delight. The weird sky blue of the band's uniform is posed against the drab desert background of the town.
  This movie is not flawless. I found it difficult to believe that the feisty lead female character would allow herself to be stuck in a place like Beit Hatikva.

3345780,4,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is an unexpected comedy about the meeting of Arab and Jewish cultures in Israel -unexpected because the cultures don't clash in any obvious way, and there is no hostility between the characters. Instead, a few bored working class Jews living in a dull desert town welcome the change of pace occasioned by a band of stranded Egyptians. The eight-man Alexandria Ceremonial Orchestra has traveled from Egypt to play at the opening of an Arab Cultural Center in Petah Tikva. But through an error of pronunciation, they take the bus to Bet Hatikva instead, a fictional drab desert town dominated by ugly mid-rise apartment buildings. A free-spirited, lonely restaurateur named Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) volunteers herself and two friends to put the band up for the night.

Writer and director Eran Kolirin has made a sweet, low-key dramedy in which everything is played straight, not for laughs. Indeed, Dina's loneliness and band leader Tewfiq Zakaria's (Sasson Gabai) embarrassment are palpable. That's not funny, but the characters seem genuine, and their situation is awkwardly amusing. Ronit Elkabetz deserves a lot of credit for making frank, bored Dina into a real charmer who steals every scene. Saleh Bakri is also a lot of fun to watch as handsome Haled, the band's youngest and most insolent member whose primary pursuit is flirting. Though ""The Band's Visit"" is obviously contrived to make a socio-political statement as well as to entertain, it is successful because these are characters that the audience would want to spend time with. In English, Hebrew, and Arabic with subtitles.

The DVD (Sony 2008): Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min), a Photo Gallery of 29 stills, and a featurette called ""The Band's Visit: Making the Fairy Tale"" (14 min). It interviews writer/director Eran Kolirin about the project, composer Habib Shadah about the score, and actors Sasson Gabai, Ronit Elkabetz, and Saleh Bakri about their characters and working with Kolirin. Subtitles for the film are available in English. More than half of the film's dialogue is in English, as it is the language that the Israeli and Egyptian characters have in common. But due to their strong accents, the English dialogue is also subtitled.",1222387200,,2244,5.145205479452055
3345781,2,B0013HL6ES,"I remember feeling excited about this movie when I saw the previews.
Finally!  A movie about the oddness one would feel if travelling in
a usually hostile land.  When I saw ""The Band"" trailer, it seemed
hilarious.  An Egytian Band touches down in Israel with the intention
of playing at the opening of a cultural center.  Their egotistical
band leader gets them lost beyond help and they end up staying where
they are stranded in a small town where there are quirky but sleepy
characters.  The only problem is...it wasn't funny.  I found myself
wanting to laugh.  The movie gets heavy really fast.  The serousness
of these characters lives: an aging divorcee, an arguing young couple,
a social awkward young adult all bog down the storyline.  In the end
all you can manage to do is shake your head.  The only humor in the
movie, as the band tries in the beginning to make their way around
Israel, is the sense that you're the butt of the joke.  As an Egyptian-American, I was looking forward to this movie; in the end I regretted buying it.",1221264000,3,1040,4.5675675675675675
3345782,4,B0013HL6ES,"The case for this DVD advertises that this movie has earned over thirty-five international awards. In my mind it has earned every one of them. Pitched as a comedy, the film moves beyond mere laughs to that deeply human place in each one of us, no matter what your language or culture. Eight members of the ""Alexandrian Police Ceremonial Orchestra"" from Egypt, complete in their powder blue band uniforms, are on a visit to the Arab cultural center in Pet Hatikvah, Israel. A bad bus ride strands them in the isolated and desolate village of Bet Hatikva. In their broken English, members of the band and their Israeli hosts communicate across the boundaries of language, culture, gender roles, and, of course, millennia of mutual suspicions. But with the help of music and the vulnerabilities they experience because of their predicament, they open themselves up to each others' stories.

Well, the script is a masterpiece: not only for what is said, but what is unsaid.  The acting is magnificent: you see and feel the joy, sorrow, anxiety, loneliness, melancholy, satisfaction, mistrust, respect.  The cinematography is extraordinary: a thread of beautiful still photographs, seamlessly stitched to form a beautiful tapestry.  While we may be culturally diverse, have different religious beliefs, or none at all, speak different languages, harbor ancient distrusts, we are in fact human, and must exercise the right to act humanely.  No film I know says this quite so clearly, or beautifully.  The winner of 35 international film awards, The Band's Visit is The Best Movie I own.",1220227200,2,876,5.090909090909091
3345784,4,B0013HL6ES,"An Egyptian police band flies to Israel to play a concert but takes the wrong bus and ends up stranded in a tiny Israeli hamlet. They get to know a number of the locals, and the interactions run the gamut: painfully (hilariously) awkward, funny, sad.

The interactions between locals are as likely to be awkward (and funny) as those between locals and the visitors, just in more familiar ways. Maybe the film is about how emotions can cross cultures (even cultures known to have animosity), but I just found it funny and sweet and (sometimes) sad. But it is very well done, and I recommend it. (My wife and I both gave it an 8/10, which is strong praise.)

The film is in English, Hebrew, and (presumably) Egyptian Arabic. We picked it up at our local Blockbuster.

The film is PG-13. I remember one swear word and one split-second glimpse of a couple of arms and legs (which could be interpreted as sensuality).",1219622400,,912,4.58282208588957
3345785,4,B0013HL6ES,"'It's the wrong time and the wrong place...' - there are so many excerpts of songs quoted in this movie and ones that stimulate memories of old songs that are very much in keeping with the title and the story, THE BAND'S VISIT (BIKUR HA-TIZMORET).  A timely piece, this little film is about humanity and the possibility of communication by various means that overcome differences between cultures far better than treaties, summit meetings, and physical and verbal demonstrations.  It is a thoughtful, engaging, and completely delightful success.

The Alexandria Police Ceremonial Orchestra with 'General' Tewfiq (Sasson Gabai) rigidly in charge provides music for occasions, and the particular occasion for this venture is a ceremony in Israel.  Flying in from Egypt well dressed in light blue uniforms to perform for the new Arab Culture Center, the small band is not met as expected at the airport. Tewfiq attempts to resolve the lack of proper greeting and transportation by reserving space on a bus - a trip that mistakenly (through problems originating in language confusion) results in the band being dropped off in a small village Bet Hatikva. Frustrated with circumstances, the band is met with genial hospitality by caf owner Dina (Ronit Elkabetz) who not only feeds them but puts the small band up for the evening.  Dina has eyes for Tewfig and plans an evening out on the town with him - an evening that has its own surprises as each lonely person shares life circumstances.  The other members of the band are placed in lodging with Dina's workers and at a dinner party discover similarities in their lives. Khaled (Saleh Bakri), a somewhat antagonistic ladies' man, spends an evening with a terrified young man Papi (Shlomi Avraham) on his first real date, and in the course of the evening introduces the fine art of courtship to Papi in a hilarious but touching scene.

The use of English as the common language between these Arab and Hebrew speaking people adds elements of humor as well as moments of sweetness as both the band members and the Israelis grow to know and care about each other.  The conversations among each separate group are delivered in Arabic and Hebrew with English subtitles and this degree of modified privacy becomes almost more humorous because of the bumpy language barriers shared with the audience.  Everyone grows through this short visit and by the time the band departs for their correct destination by the next morning's bus, bonds have been made that preserve the dignity of nationality while overriding the limitations of differences peculiar to each country.  This is a quiet, gentle, at times very humorous little movie that offers insights of how to attain global community for us all. Writer/director Eran Kolirin deserves special recognition for assembling and molding  this excellent cast for this remarkable, genuinely compassionate statement about important issues.

3345786,3,B0013HL6ES,"This is a moderately engaging tale of an Egyptian police band who become stranded in a backwater Israeli town after taking a bus to the wrong place to do a concert for the opening of an Arabic Cultural Center.  Since this one-horse town has no hotel, the proprietress of a local diner and some other folks put up the band members for one night until they can catch a bus to the correct destination.  That night challenges them all.

To say that the movie is understated is an understatement in itself.  Ronit Elkabetz is excellent as the smoldering Dina.  But the film moves at a glacial pace that may tax the patience and attention span of many viewers.

Arab and Jew are supposed to be enemies, bit the film is effective in showing that one a person to person level, affinities can overcome these prejudices.",1218240000,4,810,4.551724137931035
3345787,4,B0013HL6ES,"This movie was different from what I expected. I thought it would be faster-paced; a little bit on the edge, perhaps a little controversial.  It was none of these.  Instead, ""The Band's Visit"" is a quiet movie, made great by terrific acting, both by the Israelis and by the Arabs. Each part was played to understated perfection. I also liked the way the director cast very ordinary looking people, some with less than great teeth or bodies, to be the stars of the movie.  In addition, the people in this film seem weighted down by boredom, loneliness or both- just like in real life! But moments of real insight do occur, which make the movie touching and worthwhile.  Watch this movie when you are in a reflective mood, and enjoy!",1217894400,,731,4.6
3345788,5,B0013HL6ES,"Other reviews here detail the story and the plot, so there is no need to repeat that. The Band of Egyptians ends up in a small town (small? I think the population must be less than 100 residents) for the night when they get off at the wrong bus stop and there is only one bus per day.

Originally I though that that it would have the Arabs lost in a big Israeli city with a different culture. But this small town is not the typical Israeli big city with its own cultural prejudices. This two is much more laid back. ""Laid back"" and ""subtle"" are two phrases that constantly came to mind as I viewed this quiet 87-minute gem of a film. No one rushes. There is no loud screaming or yelling. And there are moments when there are no words.

This film is really tri-lingual. Much of the dialogue is in English. When called for, the Israelis speak in Hebrew and the Arabs speak in Arabic. And it's not always consistent. When the dialogue is not in English, there are easy to read English subtitles in yellow. It's interesting that the final credits - which must go on for more than five minutes - are in Hebrew and Arabic with no translation as to which cast members played which roles. You will learn this, however on the 10 minute ""Making of"" featurette that, along with a ""photo gallery"" forms the ""Bonus Features"". There is no commentary. The ""Making of..."" doesn't add much, except to identify the MAJOR cast members.

I agree with the others that the scene at the roller rink is the most memorable one. It really stands out.

This film won lots of awards - and deservedly so - and should attract more fans as it hits DVD shelves later this month.

3345789,5,B0013HL6ES,"I saw this film on a plane to Israel.
In three words: I WAS MESMERIZED!
 It was a pure Magic!  I even didn't know the name of the movie until it ended.
Brilliant Creation! Deserves OSCARS in every single category!",1214870400,3,213,4.3
3345790,5,B0013HL6ES,"I vote for this as one of my favorites of all time. It is as close to a perfect film as I've ever seen, and it is not even in the same dimension of reality as the current crop of movie products with their ear-splitting audio effects that come at you from every side of the cinema, with their special digital enhancement, and with their increasingly tortured and multi-layered plots that remind one of video games.

This film will seem unbearably slow if you are a fan of such current movie spew. If you slow down enough to understand that you are seeing brilliant filmmaking and photography, this is a rewarding two hours. One is struck immediately by the carefully wrought visuals...the sere desert vistas broken by the neon blue of the band members' uniforms. The dialogue is spare; one learns about each character by watching his or her face and movements. The story is straight forward: a small-town Egyptian policemen's band travels to visit a village in Israel to play a concert, when they are misdirected and end up, too late in the day to rectify their mistake, at a village with a similar name, far from their destination. The story takes place during that evening and the next morning.

There are some moments from this film that are etched in my memory...one in a roller-skate disco where the noise from the crowd and the dancers obscures most dialogue. We watch the main characters from across the room and the action is over-the-top hilarious. The small art cinema where I was watching exploded in laughter time and time again, for five minutes.

If you can catch it at a cinema or art theater, do see it there. If not, the DVD will be out soon.",1210636800,3,1658,4.594594594594595
3345791,5,B0013HL6ES,"""The Band's Visit"" is 87 minutes of perfection from writer/director Eran Kolirin.  There's little dialogue, accounting in part to language barriers, but more due to the dearth of things to talk about in the forgotten outpost of Beit Hatikva.  Moreover, its residents seem talked-out and beaten down.  Beautiful but weary Dina (the wonderful Ronit Elkabetz) nails the essence of the town's residents when she says that their misdirected Arab guests - looking for the Arab Culture Center - will find ""No Arab culture, no Israeli culture, no culture at all.""

I'm struck by how Kolirin makes those few words matter so much.  Over a dozen scenes are stuck permanently in my head a full month or more after our viewing.  Two scenes in particular stand out:

- An indescribably well-played wordless piece where jazz hipster Haled (Saleh Bakri) leads an inept Papi (Shlomi Avraham) through his first encounter with a girl.  Brilliant direction here by Kolirin.

- A brilliant scene in which band director Tawfiq (regally portrayed by Sasson Gabai) reluctantly reveals the reason behind his romantic reticence.  The core of the scene - when Tawfiq says ""You are a good woman, Dina, I am sure of it"" - elicts a reaction from Ms. Elkabetz bemoaning a life spent worrying about silly things that don't matter now.  It's stirring cinema.

So, now we add ""The Band's Visit"" to my growing list of Israeli films you must see:

Nothing is resolved, but in the end the audience comes to the same conclusion as the characters: we are all human, all out of place, and all beset with problems.  The political message is obvious.  It's way too rosy, but does not intrude into the story.  But, then, no critic would want to criticize a message like this. That's probably why it is overrated.
