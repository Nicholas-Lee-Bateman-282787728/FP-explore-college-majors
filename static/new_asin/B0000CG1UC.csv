7999290,4,B0000CG1UC,"I cannot believe this video has not been rated yet. I, and what's more important--my almost 4-year old--love it. It's so playful and positive. It teaches vocabulary, too, and is interactive beyond just following the particular exercises. And it is absolutely age-apporiate--both setting, instruction, and exercises. All the breathing techniques coupled with yoga postures really calmed down my little bundle of nerves. The only small criticism I have is that they should have stretched the session over a few more minutes (or have offered a longer version of the session--more repetition), because at times we felt a bit rushed--especially where new vocabulary was concerned.",1123113600,6,675,5.5
