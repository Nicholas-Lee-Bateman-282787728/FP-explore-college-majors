8078548,2,B00007JZUV,"If I'd had a chance to rent this DVD first, I definately wouldn't have bought it. It's a trashy story (part 1+2), the acting is very bad, but there are some parts that are worth watching. If you are into independent movies, this movie could be some fun , but try to rent it, do not buy it. It's a waste of money.",1085270400,2,312,3.9682539682539684
