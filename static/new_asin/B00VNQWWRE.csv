8710687,4,B00VNQWWRE,"A stage version of Fame, as one of the first Western musicals performed in China, is taught to the graduating senior class of the Central Academy of Drama (Beijing) in about 2008 and filmed for a documentary released in 2013. Fame has been staged by native performers (with their languages) in most of the major countries of the world.

Could easily be five stars. Would like to have seen more background on the academy, the instructors and the students. I understand that there are budgetary, time, logistical and personal barriers to making it more complete. Also, for more accurate statistical reasons, would have liked to see the, several years later, outcomes for more of the A group and B group students we see involved in the Fame production.

What is so strikingly revealed in the film is the commonality across humanity of dreams, thoughts, behaviors, parenting, growing up. What is a little less obvious are some of the differences in cultures such as freedom of expression and individuality. Not meant as a value judgment as sacrifice, cooperation and obedience are also important values. Best illustrated in Jasper, the American musical director, who comes over to help instruct and seeing his personality interacting with the students (by the way he would make a great teacher of any subject).",1437782400,,1306,5.013824884792626
8710688,5,B00VNQWWRE,"Watched this film when it screened at the Asia Society in NYC last year. It's really not a documentary about the making of an American musical, but an examination of China's youth and the aspirations and limitations of their and their parents' generations. China is in the headline news constantly, and most of the time the news is about its human rights abuses, about how horrible the communist party is. This film gives a refreshing look at the ""common"" people (granted the kids are in the most prestigious acting school) and how they think and react to what's happening in China. Highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in contemporary China.",1437523200,,652,4.882882882882883

This (approximately) 90 minute documentary by director Hao Wu (who was a biologist in the US for 12 years before returning to his homeland of China) follows five of the 16 young students at Beijings Central Academy of Drama on their quest to make a future life in the dramatic arts. They are the first of the generation since China put into place a one-child rule and they are much different than their parents. The mechanism that director Wu uses is the joint production of the Broadway musical Fame. (Not the film or the TV show with the same subject and name but with different songs.

This film is not unlike documentaries like Hoop Dreams (basketball) or dance or piano competitions. The director has no way of knowing how the story will end. He just keeps filming and hopes for the best.

The students who are chosen come from varied families  some have single parent, some are rich, while others are poor.
You will see rehearsals but there are no complete songs.  And the score from the Broadway version did not have the staying power of that in the original film (songs by Michael Gore and Dean Pitchford). I did see the musical in tryouts in Philadelphia but, other than the title song  carried over from the film and TV series  none were still in my memory.

Yes, I enjoyed seeing it. I like documentaries like this. But I do wish there was more music.

The DVD has one bonus feature. It is a 21-minute Interview with Hao Wu, per the description on the package. In fact it is a discussion (not an interview) among two women (one of who is an American who attended primary school in China. She spends a lot of time discussing the subject of the one-child policy with the other woman and they virtually ignore Wu. He gets to say something at the end but I got very little info about the film from this 21 minutes.

I really wanted to love this film but I found it dragging at times. I want to really give it 3  stars but will round off to four.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
