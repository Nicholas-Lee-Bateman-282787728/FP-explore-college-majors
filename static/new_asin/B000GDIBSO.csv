2605013,4,B000GDIBSO,"""Our Brand Is Crisis"" (2005 release; 85 min.) brings the story of the 2002 Bolivian presidential campaign of Gonzalez ""Goni"" Sanchez, an affluent American-Bolivian who already once was president of Bolivia in the 90s. As the documentary opens, we are told ""February 2003"", and get to see shocking footage of riots in the streets of LA Paz, Bolivia's capital. After that, we are transported back to a year earlier, February 2002, and we get to meet Goni and his team of advisors. It includes an arsenal of savvy (and surely expensive) Washington K Street consultants, including of course James Carville, who are trying to devise a winning strategy for Goni, lagging far behind in the polls, with only 6 months to go before the elections. To tell you much more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is one heck of a riveting documentary. It helps that apparently the film makers were given unprecedented all-access to seemingly the most confidential and most strategic of meetings. It helps if you don't know the outcome of the election (which was my case), but I will venture to say that even if I had known, it would still have been one heck of a ride. Second, the strategies used by the American consulting team (focus groups, negative ads, etc.) are of course used widely here in the US, but it is fascinating to see them deployed in this foreign context. Third, one of the campaign slogans used by Goni and his team is,,,, dare you guess.... ""yes it can be done!"". Sounds familiar? Last but certainly not least, we get to the election results about an hour into the movie. So you are probably wondering what is left to be said for the next 25 min. and I'm certainly not going to spoil it here. Just watch! You will be surprised...

Bottom line, if you like documentaries or if you are interested in politics in general, and foreign politics in particular, you don't want to miss this. Truly an excellent documentary that seems as fresh today, 2014, as when it came out in 2005. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1389830400,,2129,4.674666666666667

2605016,5,B000GDIBSO,"""Our Brand Is Crisis"" (2005) is an extremely interesting documentary that tells us about the campaign of Gonzalo Snchez de Losada to become president of Bolivia. How did he become president, and why did he decide to ""brand crisis"" in order to run a successful campaign? What role did the American political strategists he hired played in the 2003 Bolivian elections? And what ended up going wrong, after he was elected? The answers to those questions, and more, can be found in this dvd.

I would like to highlight the fact that this documentary is made out of real life footage of meetings between Snchez de Lozada and his advisors (before, during and after the campaign), and also contains some footage of the events that led to his resignation. This is not fiction, but reality, and that is one of the reasons why it is so illuminating.

I believe that this dvd should be seen by those who are interested in political campaigns, political advertising or mass media, but also by the kind of people who like to watch an engaging documentary that helps them to understand the world we live in. ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" shows us that a presidential candidate is promoted in more or less the same way a product is advertised. However, if you buy the wrong product you can always return it. If you choose a president that is not good for your country because you believe what a wonderful advertising campaign designed through polls tells you, your country suffers.

All in all, I am very happy I watched this dvd. It is the kind of documentary that you don't forget, and that gives you food for thought. Highly recommended!

2605017,4,B000GDIBSO,"This documentary traces the re-election campaign of Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (Goni), which was largely run by paid, American political consultants.  Their challenge: to get their candidate re-elected even though as president his highly unpopular free-market policies had done nothing to alleviate the extreme poverty and unemployment the country was facing, and even though he was perceived as an arrogant, elitist, fair-skinned, American-raised ""gringo"" who was out of touch with the poor, indigenous majority of Bolivia.

Despite all these obstacles, we see how the consultants were able to use polls, focus groups, negative attack campaigns and advertisements to successfully market their candidate (Noam Chomsky always talks about how political campaigns are like selling toothpaste; here we see a perfect example).  They also benefited from a political system in which a candidate could win with a plurality of the vote: the vote ended up being divided between three main candidates, allowing Goni to win with only 22% of the popular vote.

However, as Goni continued to implement unpopular policies even after the election, the Bolivian people took to the streets en masse to demand his ouster.  Goni fled to the U.S., where he now resides, while his vice president took over until the next election in which the indigenous, left-wing candidate Evo Morales came to power with an overwhelming majority of the vote.

What I found most amazing was how little the paid, American political consultants knew about the policies that ""their"" candidate was implementing and how adversely they were affecting the people.  Knowing that he was the ""free-market"" candidate (a supporter of the so-called ""Washington consensus""), was enough to convince them to work for his re-election; and these are the people who represent the ""left"" in the U.S. (James Carville and the like).  It was also shocking and disappointing to see how easily people are manipulated (i.e., Goni is not faring well in the polls so the political consultants run some ads discrediting his opponent and re-inventing Goni's image; the next focus groups and polls show that it has had the desired effect: people now like Goni better than his opponent).  People always say they know political ads are bogus, but yet they clearly work each and every time.  One questions the viability of ""real democracy"" when so many people are so easily manipulated.

Personally I would have liked to see more information about the mass protests that ousted Goni and brought about the rise to power of Evo Morales.  But, I suppose that would really be another documentary.  Still, this one is worth watching.",1166832000,,2655,5.218823529411765

This sowed the seeds of violent dissent and led to Goni's eventual resignation and the rise of Evo's revolutionary regime. The documentary is excellent, and there is a final shot of Evo, having learned he is now in power, looking out the window of his airplane, a stunned, worried look on his face.

8130781,5,B000GDIBSO,"I intend to watch the 2015 film Our Brand Is Crisis sometime within the next 14 days. However, I followed my intuition to check out the documentary that the 2015 movie is based on in order to get a stronger understanding of what is happening and to help me further understand and enjoy the 2015 movie of Our Brand is Crisis (starring Sandra Lee Bullock and Billy Bob Thornton) when I go to watch it.  I admit that shocked is probably an understatement a person can use to describe what is listed online to be Our Brand is Crisis from the year 2005. The following are some of the facts that I was able to write down from the Our Brand Is Crisis Documentary (any that I left out was done with harmless intent as I was also doing my best to relax a little while watching Our Brand is Crisis documentary);
The Film opens February 2003-Anti government riots break out in the streets of La Paz Bolivia. One Year Earlier February 2002; Greenville Carville Schrum (GCS) a political consulting firm in Washington D.C. is contacted by MNR Party Candidate Gonzalo (Goni) Sanchez De Lozada an MNR Party Candidate.  One of the Scenes then flashes to Jeremy Rosner GCS Pollster & Chief Strategist.
Then the screen flashes Boynton Films Presents In Association with  The BBC, Films Transit, Urban Empire, and The Slough Pond Company a film by Rachel Boynton. The film lists that Goni Sanchez was a Bolivian businessman raised in the U.S.  From 1993 to 1997 he was president of Bolivia one of the poorest countries in Latin America.  As president, Goni opened Bolivia to foreign investment in a controversial program called capitalization. This capitalization move was unpopular with many Bolivians but garnered him international praise. Now In 2002, Goni was running for president again as one of 11 candidates. He hired a team of American political consultants to advise his campaign on polling, campaign management, strategy, and advertising. The consultants flew to Bolivia to help Goni communicate his message to the people; James Carville GCS strategist, Stan Greenberg GCS pollster, and they showed Carlos Mesa the VP candidate to Gonis presidential candidacy. There was a pop culture reference of Winnie The Pooh. Other details;  Tad Devine an Advertising consultant for GCS was featured, Tal Berstein GCS consultant, Mauricio Balcazar Gonis Press Advisor, Then there is a tv ad where Goni states; Carlos mesa and I have prepared an emergency plan, restore social security, invest money in gas for youth education because Bolivia had more natural gas than any other country in Latin America;  they were planning public works to create jobs and stop the crisis, goni and mesas message at the time; were planning public works to create jobs and stop the crisis, the economy must be managed with honesty and seriousness, its not time for radical change or irresponsible experiments. Further quotes affiliated with Goni; we can stop the crisis and return hope to Bolivia. Then who appears to be one of Gonis PR (press men) says yes it can be done  with a photo of an old man smiling and the Spanish saying Si Se Puede (yes it can be done).  Goni;s campaign headquarters is shown and his political rival Evo Morales an MAS Party Candidate; Then there is a female journalistss luncheon at Gonis home, an informed female journalist posed this question to Goni at the luncheon;  they say indigenous leaders are stealing some of the MNRs traditional voters, supporters of the MNRs national revolution in 1952 what do you think, Gonis Reply; Its a strange phenomenon, very authoritarian, leaders like Evo Morales force communities to vote a certain way, well challenge this in the elections, you cant say to a town if I don't win here the indigenous leaders will punish you.
More Details in the Our Brand is Crisis documentary; Manfred Reyes Villa NFR Party Candidate, part of Reyes statement;  A President must be sensitive, he must travel throughout the country listening to the people we no longer want to see 800,000 children working in the streets selling candies, polishing shoes, or washing cars, that must be the Boliva of the past, the Boliva of the old, Cochabamba you allowed me to change this city as its mayor, now I ask you to help me change our beloved Bolivia so we live with sovereignty, dignity, and care for one another. Then the documentary moves to a scene at the home of Carlos Morales-Gonis campaign manager. Another scene at what is listed in the documentary to be called the Marketing SRL in Bolivia shows the citizens (a forcus group)of Bolivia mentioning this about Goni for the purpose of the American political communication consultants collecting polling information; Remember when Goni was president what did he do? Social Security, health insurance, educational reform, capitalization, what do you think of capitalization and Goni/ He says capitalization created jobs, it didnt, it brought investments, foreigners came took our jobs and left us with nothing, Goni thinks the last time he was president everything was pink, just great. Now Goni wants to do everything the same, which is bad, our governments haven't met our basic needs; education, housing, jobs, thats why we feel discontent. Then there is a scene showing Manuel Rocha- U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia. Election Final Results;  Goni-22.5%, Evo-20.9%, Manfred-20.8%, fast forward to 7 months after election February 9, 2003-Goni admits that the country of Bolivia is at a crossroads and implied that changing the income taxes are a way to get the money flowing in Bolivia again. The Our Brand is Crisis documentary listed these tax proposals from Goni; If You Earn 1000 BS (143 dollars a month at the time) then the tax is 15 BS (2 dollars per month), If you earn 2000 BS (285 dollars per month) the tax is 140 BS (20 U.S. dollars at the time; 2003).",1446163200,,5824,4.895537525354969
