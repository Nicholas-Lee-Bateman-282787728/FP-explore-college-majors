1068682,5,6305761310,"This is a lovely film. I warn you that some may find it too slow because it takes a very painterly look at the microcosm of this aging man's world.  If you can lose yourself in the art of it though, the pace will be just right.  One of the people I saw this film with in the theater found it very depressing because of the old age approaching death aspect.  Although the elderly painter is certainly moving in that direction, this film is much more about how his art is integral to his life and how his family fits into this scheme when they visit him one Sunday in his country studio and home.  If you are an artist or art lover, you will adore this film for the visual feast that it is.

1068683,4,6305761310,"Just want to corroborate what the earlier 2 reviews state and to add that on the dvd is an audio commentary track by the director, a fact I had not seen published anywhere and did not actually discover until I purchased the  dvd.  Lovely transfer, lovely film.",959990400,17,260,4.51063829787234
1068684,5,6305761310,"Every frame of this film is like watching an Impressionist canvas in motion. This gentle, poignant character study of an elderly painter in the  early 1900s is packed with beauty, insight and three-dimensional  characters. Louis Ducreux, a French stage star who made his movie debut  here at age 73, is subtle, compelling and deeply moving, as are the rest of  the actors. The exquisite sound track (based mostly on the chamber music of  Gabriel Faure) enhances the sunny yet wistful tone of the film. It's  defintely not a movie for thrill-seekers, but for those seeking a two-hour  vacation in a slower, gentler and lovelier world, it's a gem.",919555200,30,645,4.916666666666667
7894296,5,6305761310,"a very great movie, photography, the music of faure, with a story line of great sadness and great joy.  The interplay between the artist and his daughter is so moving and the family dynamics are real and poinent.  This is one of my all time favorite movies, you must be sensitive to the arts to really appreciate this wonderful fiilm, Jacques Linder",1457049600,,349,4.612903225806452
7894297,3,6305761310,"This is a feel-good, sentimental, nostalgic movie about an old man and his children and grandchildren. Expert an experience but hardly a story.",1428019200,,143,5.260869565217392

7894299,5,6305761310,"This is one of the great films.  A very universal and touching story that is well told.  Visually, a beautiful trip to the art of early 20th century France with well chosen Faure music of the period.  This would be especially good for high school viewing and discussion.  The French is clear and good subtitles.  I had this on VHS and awaited it on DVD for years.  Finally it is here.",1385251200,,384,4.338028169014085
7894300,5,6305761310,"This beautiful film is also a meditation on beauty and regret.  The beauty is obvious - it's pre-1914 France, a Sunday in the country, and the landscape, clothes, food and people are gorgeous.  And yet the patriarch of the family is a painter who rejected the Impressionists and is now wondering if that was the right thing to do.  And so the theme of regret enters the movie.  Then comes his son and his wife and their children.  The son, despite once being a painter himself - he gave it up to avoid being his father's rival - is a solid member of the bourgeoisie and clearly a disappointment to his father.  The son knows this and regrets it.

Then the old man's daughter comes.  Everyone loves her, including the children. The scene where she plays a game with the children that ends when the parents want to join in is a very well-observed one.  Somehow the son and his wife are cut out of that joy of childhood, and they regret that.  And we find that the daughter has her own complicated life back in Paris, too.  The children are the ones that don't regret.  One is tempted to say that that is what defines them as not yet adults.

At the end of the film is a beautiful scene of the landscape that serves as a reminder of the beauty around us.  And yet I wonder if the old man would look at it with regret, since the Impressionists have already painted it so well.  And yet the beauty remains.",1300665600,8,1401,4.293893129770993
7894301,5,6305761310,"Since the first opening shot, you will be conveyed into a magical world at the beginning of the XX century, where the impressive talent of one of the most remarkable French directors ever born - Bertrand Tavernier - renders his personal homage, not only  to Jean Renoir's ""A day in the country"" ; but the Impressionist art of painting with Manet as the principal starring.

The fabulous images, arresting landscapes, lavish photograph hover the whole picture; around the lives and times of an elderly widowed French artist who never the made the grade in order to achieve a major receptivity into his artistic circle. He is visited by his short family a Sunday and so we will witness with astonishing accuracy and fluid camerawork, the intimacies of this family. There are smart flashbacks around Irene his vanished wife and the peaceful way of living of the last days of the XIX Century.

The script flows with organic majesty and marvelous dignity. Tavernier achieved a genuine jewel of infinite carats.

By no reason you should miss this treasured film of the Eighties. One of my favorite films to watch over and over again.",1171411200,6,1127,4.854166666666667
7894302,5,6305761310,"I had hunted for this movie for some time - thinking that it was named ""A Day in the Country!"" I remember that when I initially saw it in a theater that it made a distinct impression(!) on me. it was less the melancolly story than the visually beautiful French countryside and farm where the movie takes place.  It is not unlike experiencing an Monet painting comming to life!  One of the most beautifully filmed, relaxing movies that I have ever viewed.",1168300800,3,454,4.524390243902439
7894303,5,6305761310,"Proof that sometimes the simplest approaches can achieve the greatest results. An old man (played by Louis Ducreux), a successful Impressionistic painter in turn-of-the-century France, is visited one Sunday by his son (Michel Aumont) and his daughter (Sabine Azema). Over the course of the movie we see Ducreux's supreme disappointment in his dull, overly careful, and plodding son, and his delight with his enthusiastic, live-wire daughter, who has rarely come to visit him. The film is beautifully photographed, as pleasantly eye-filling as any Impressionistic painting might hope to be. There is not a lot of plot or action, but the simple unfolding of peaceful events over the course of what appears to be a typical Sunday afternoon in the spring countryside reveals not only a serene setting, but an excellent work of visual filmmaking. A rich movie-watching experience.",1139961600,6,875,5.3478260869565215
7894304,5,6305761310,"Set during the Nazi occupation of France, in ""Conduct"" we see the often chaotic, painstaking process of making movies, made even more challenging by the presence of an enemy whose central doctrine discounts free artistic expression. These filmmakers (played to perfection by Jacques Gamblin and Denis Podalydes) deal with their German overseers to get their movie made, while risking their lives aiding the resistance. Their authentic courage is more compelling than any hero they could manufacture on-screen.",1125878400,,509,5.623376623376624
7894305,4,6305761310,"The film is breathtakingly beautiful making me wish to spend time in the country in France. In an old quaint house surrounded by nature. You can almost smell the fresh air and the appertifs they sip under the portico with the trees rustling in the breeze. The movie centers around the aging patriarch of the family. His wife has passed on and he keeps his lonliness at bay with the help of a housekeeper and his consistant Sunday visits from his ploddingly staid son and wife, two grandboys who much rather play together than be with the adult and one granddaughter who seems somewhat shy and clinging toward her mother. The daughter in law seems also somewhat ordinary with a need for chruch and religion in her life. Than in comes his other child, a daughter, quite the opposite of her brother, full of life, passion and a great desire for the country. She has brought her auto, which was a big thing. The movie is set in pre-WW1 France. I forgot to mention the main character paints, he seems to paint alcoves of the room, pieces of furniture, indoors kind of stuff. The daughter wakes him up out of his complacency, also waking up the rest of the Sunday family visitors. She gets them out of their lethargy and moves them to action. She is the first to leave but her prescence lingers. When the movie ends you have a strong feeling that the main character has made a shift from painting only objects that grace his indoor sanctuary.
