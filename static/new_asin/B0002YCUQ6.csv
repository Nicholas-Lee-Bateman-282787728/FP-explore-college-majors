2144722,2,B0002YCUQ6,"Don't take my rating wrong, I don't hate this cartoon, what I hate is the way Lucasfilm has handled the property. Basically what this release is is 8 episodes from the first season of the show cobbled together to form two very unbalanced animated films. What we do get is basically 8 episodes of the show with new adult Wicket voice-overs. What we don't get is the opening theme song, original end credits, and I have a feeling original music (though I guess I'll never know since this will probably be the only release in this format.) At least the ""chapters"" are labeled with the original episode titles. I know this sounds nit-picky and in the vein of the ""complainers"" of the ill done reissues of the Original Star Wars trilogy on DVD, but come on. What is the purpose of releasing an old saturday morning cartoon, almost certainly because the fans demanded it for nostalgia purposes, and then heavily editing it so that it has almost no feel of how it originally aired?",1112572800,24,974,4.603448275862069

I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about the first release of these two ""Ewok"" cartoon episodes, ""The Haunted Village"" & ""Tales from the Endor Woods"" some I agree with, others I don't. I remember seeing this animated series during its original television run in 1985 through 1987 as I went from a 10-year-old boy to a 12-year-old pre-adolescent and I loved these cartoons growing up and I still do. I only wish that Lucas had released all of them instead of just two of them. These ""Ewok"" cartoons take place before the two Ewok television movies as we watch Wicket, Princess Kneesaa, and Teebo grow up on the moon of Endor. Once again George Lucas is executive producer as he did with ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" & ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"" and that in part is what made this animated television series so good, because George Lucas is a great storyteller, creating great characters and a great adventure to watch those characters grow within the episodes, but he is no director. Any episodes of this wonderful animated series is highly recommended and a great & positive influence for children to watch.",1110931200,7,1166,4.660194174757281
2144724,2,B0002YCUQ6,"I loved this series, when I was still a kid living in Germany.

It was much more popular than DROIDS here. I think because of the nice stories and ""bears"" are more popular than robots - at least for girls....

But this isn't it - the old videoreleases where a ripoff too,

only one episode on one video- but at least chronologically.

They could have released a whole season, the whole series,

or only one episode, but not for this price !

If you don't have the videos, you can try it -

but better buy the videos.

This is only a VHS on DVD, it just isn't using the possibilities of the DVD.",1105747200,3,594,4.149122807017544
2144725,1,B0002YCUQ6,I was so disappointed!!  I'd settle for the worst cartoons on Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network than waste any more precious time watching this garbage!!,1104883200,3,150,5.25
2144726,1,B0002YCUQ6,"Glad I didn't waste my money on this!

I'm sure it is just as hacked and bad as Droids.",1101600000,3,87,3.5789473684210527
2144727,1,B0002YCUQ6,"Clearly, the Lucasfilm motto: ""Don't give them everything, or else how are we going to milk this in the future?""

Yes, it's wonderful that they are releasing this - but be honest - this is either a half-hearted effort OR a devious plan for future double dipping. Lucasfilm is started to gain a notorious rep for releasing titles with little features (i.e. the Indiana Jones box set - no commentaries) or ""modified"" versions with obvious plans for double-dipping the public (i.e. The Star Wars Trilogy - hello). I agree with the many reviewers who wanted the complete series of Ewoks and Droids. Expect this to happen with the future planned Star Wars TV series, too. Why release the entire season, when they can milk several DVDs throughout several years. And yes, the Holiday Special will get released eventually (""Because you demanded it..."") with several DVD editions. I wish Lucasfilm would recognize the fan base, instead of just mapping out where the dollar signs are. They did a wonderful job with books in the 1990's, now it's time for the DVDs.",1100649600,23,1053,4.85
2144728,1,B0002YCUQ6,"The problem with this is that unlike all other TV series which generally include proper credits for each episode, commentaries, special features, original music & sounds... in other words, the real TV series, this offers NOTHING. This is a cheap way to test the waters to see if anyone would drop the cash on the whole set. Lucasfilm says ""this is what people have been waiting for."" No, no it isn't. Season one of the Ewoks ran with the droids in a program called ""The Ewoks & Droids Adventure Hour"" & had a wonderful theme song by blues artist Taj Mahal. The stories were wonderful & in a way, built on one another. Season two ran alone & was drawn a bit differently & focused mainly on Wicket, Teebo, Kneesaa, & Latara. It was geared mostly for the very young, except for a couple of episodes (""The Night of the Stranger"" & ""Battle For The Sunstar""). Season two also was a bit more varied with several of the episodes split into two stories, offering more tales from the Endor woods.

 At any rate, this IS NOT what people have been waiting for at all. It's the same as it was on VHS, meaning that they only offer a few episodes, different music, & a whole lot of nothing else. Wait for the release of the rest of the series (but not too long, because they never will). If you want to blow your dough on this, go ahead. I certainly wouldn't.",1096848000,31,1344,4.350597609561753
2144729,5,B0002YCUQ6,"It was great, the 2 Ewoks movies, and now the Ewoks cartoon series re-released on dvd. I hope they release the rest of the ewoks cartoon episodes to complete the series.",1096675200,7,169,4.483870967741935
2144730,1,B0002YCUQ6,"Man, I was really looking forward to this. ""Ewoks on DVD? Sweet beans!"" Ah, no. Instead of a standard DVD boxed set of the thirty-eight episodes in the series, we get, after years of waiting, a couple of poorly edited episodes stuck together and billed as a ""feature film"" just a few years after the same stunt was pulled on VHS. Hmmmm . . .

Seriously now: does ANYONE prefer these cobbled-together ""movies"" with about five separate plots to the ordinary method of NOT BUTCHERING the original episodes and packaging them together by season with the opening theme song and closing credits intact? Maybe if they made both versions available, but NO. We get stuck with the same crap that we can still get on VHS.

And as if this abominable amalgamation wasn't bad enough, they're not even releasing all the episodes in this format. Someone, PLEASE help me wrap my head around this logic. What possible reason can there be for not releasing all of the episodes, especially when half of the ones they are releasing, screwed up though they may be, were just released a few years ago? What is this, some kind of sick mental game? Will they wait until DVDs are obsolete and then start selectively releasing episodes AGAIN?

Come on, Lucasfilm, you're better than this. Almost EVERYBODY ELSE gets this stuff right; why can't you?

Looks like I'll just have to sit back and wait for ""next time,"" whenever that may be.",1094947200,84,1408,4.6882591093117405

2144744,1,B0002YCUQ6,"I have read what other reviewers had to say about this Ewoks DVD release and I completely agree, they are not being nitpicky, they are telling the truth - This is total CRAP!  I found my copy for 4 dollars at a local pond shop where I live which is the only reason I even picked it up.  I would never have paid amazon's outrageous price for it.  I have never seen anything butchered this badly in my life.  I used to watch this show when I was a kid and I remember it soooo differently.  The episodes that are included are badly edited together and have footage missing(in addition to the already missing original opening theme song and original end credits).  All I can say is is that if George Lucas were ever to be roasted on the comedy network, this particular DVD release would be thrown right in his face.  Hopefully one day this show will be released in proper seasonal packaging with all the episodes fully restored.  But this CRAP is a total abomination to the star wars saga and a major insult to every star wars fan out there.",1306281600,3,1037,4.33678756476684
2144745,2,B0002YCUQ6,"I've been looking forward to Ewoks the Animation to come to dvd just as long as I've waited for She-Ra, He-Man, etc. But it's not a box set, or Volume series. It's just a few episodes, enough to tease, then disapoint you. so if you think you'll be content with a few episodes go ahead.

2144747,4,B0002YCUQ6,"My 5 year old loves this DVD to the point that we have had it for a little over a week and he has already watched both sides numerous times (asks for it every night). The best way I can describe it is a Star Wars Carebear cartoon. A little less cutesy than the Carebears, but basically the same target age-group/level. However, the other C3P0/R2D2 cartoon DVD was not liked as much and he actually got bored of it fairly quickly.",1216857600,,429,4.308641975308642

2144749,1,B0002YCUQ6,You buy these types of shows for the nostalgia.. Not to see a new edited version of the show.

2144750,5,B0002YCUQ6,"Wow! I am thrilled they released the Ewoks on DVD! I bought it the day it got released, and have been watching it ever since :) One sad thing though is that it's only 8 out of 13 total episodes. I sure hope Fox Home Entertainment will release the last 5 episodes on an additional DVD!

The DVD includes the following episodes:

THE HAUNTED VILLAGE

- The Haunted Village

- The Cries of the Trees

- Rampage of the Phlogs

- Sunstar vs. Shadowstone

TALES FROM THE ENDOR WOODS

- Wicket's Wagon

- The Travelling Jindas

- To Save Deej

- Asha

Missing episodes:

- The Tree of Light

- The Curse of the Jindas

- The Land of the Gupins

- The Three Lessons

- Blue Harvest

Picture and sound quality is very good, and if you feel it would fun watching your old favorite animated adventure, go ahead and buy this exceptionally great DVD!",1116374400,13,837,4.256410256410256
8034751,2,B0002YCUQ6,"Word of warning for those investigating this item -- it is NOT the complete ""Ewoks"" cartoon on DVD.  It's eight episodes of the show spliced together to make two almost-feature-length movies.  If you're expecting all episodes of the show in one collection, this isn't it.  And sadly, unlike the ""Droids"" collection where the two ""movies"" were at least coherent and made sense, here it's quite obvious where the various episodes have been patched together.  To make matters worse, whereas the ""Droids"" cartoon at least makes sense within the ""Star Wars"" mythos and had some epic adventures, the ""Ewoks"" cartoon is full of elements that make little to no sense in the context of the rest of the ""Star Wars"" universe, and are just childishly done to boot.

The first ""movie"" follows a conflict between the Ewoks' shaman Logray and an evil witch named Morag, each of which possesses a mystic stone (the Sunstar and the Shadowstone) that they use to access magic.  Morag wants revenge on Logray for stealing the Sunstone, and on the Ewoks for daring to be connected to Logray, and she spends the ""movie"" coming up with plots to destroy the Ewoks.. plots usually foiled by three young Ewoks named Wicket (a.k.a. the Ewok who first finds Princess Leia in ""Return of the Jedi""), Teebo, and Princess Kneesa.  The second movie is a bunch of unconnected episodes, though they all do feature a regular antagonist in the form of the Dulocs, lazy and bad-tempered creatures who seem to exist just to make the Ewoks' lives miserable.

The disconnected, episodic feel of the ""movies"" is annoying enough, but the cartoon is just not terribly good overall.  It shares the iffy, frequently-off-model animation of the ""Droids"" cartoon, and somehow it manages to be even more childish than ""Droids"" was.  I understand that this cartoon was aimed at children, but at least ""Droids"" still managed to entertain with its space adventures and connection to the original trilogy.  ""Ewoks"" is almost a ""Star Wars"" cartoon in name only, and might as well be about a hidden village of magic teddy bears instead of anything related to ""Star Wars.""

That's not to say that the show is eye-bleedingly bad -- the voice acting is decent, the creature designs can be quite imaginative (though there's some occasional weirdness, such as the tree-goats), and if you can forget it's supposed to be based on the original franchise then you'll probably enjoy it as a cute, if VERY '80s-looking, cartoon.  It simply doesn't fit in with the rest of the ""Star Wars"" mythos, especially with its use of magic.  I know the Force is probably indistinguishable from magic, but the Ewoks are shown doing things with their powers that have never been established as actual Force-powers, such as shape-shifting, magic potions, etc.

Probably best for young children, this collection is bound to disappoint people wanting a full collection of the ""Ewoks"" cartoon, as well as fans expecting it to mesh well with the rest of the ""Star Wars"" universe.  I'd recommend the ""Droids"" collection instead... or better yet, Genndy Tartakovsky's ""Clone Wars"" cartoon.",1490400000,,3103,4.961389961389961
