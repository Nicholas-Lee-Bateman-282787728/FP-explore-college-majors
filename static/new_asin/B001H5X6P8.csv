8307878,4,B001H5X6P8,"This is a delightful children's nature movie, a sort of animal mother bear's docudrama, as it were. I am surprised and a bit disturbed that there had been no reviews of this 2006 film so far, which is so skillfully made, and that is a CANADIAN production, for cat's sake (!!), on Amazon's Canadian site until now (i.e. as of writing these lines, in summer 2017). The narration and the photography of polar bears, of white Arctic foxes living in symbiosis with them, of other critters (especially seals, which are polar bears' main prey, and humans making their intrusion into the far North), shot partly in the wild, Canada's Arctic North, partly of polar bears in captivity, are genuinely excellent, The moving images derive from many different sources and blend well, so skillfully edited, into a single narrative.

Despite how gently the film approaches the subject, it does not shy away from how polar bears and other animals hunt, slay, and devour the flesh and fat of other species and even -- dreaded cannibalism raises its hoary head! -- other polar bears. However, I suspect that children actually get delighted thrill out of that kind of thing rather than are frightened unduly, unless they truly are overly cosseted and pampered. Children are more morbid beings than most adults notice or remember children -- their younger selves included -- to be. What really terrifies children usually is so much more unpredictable and peculiar compared to anything that these bears and the critters around them do as seen in this film!

There are no subtitles on the DVD edition viewed (Peace Arch Entertainment, without release/catalogue number). However, most of the narration comes across sufficiently clearly, at least in English, the choice of language (with French the other option) that I made for the movie's audio.

The human voices, including that of Canada's gruff but beloved hockey announcer, Don Cherry (as a macho but helpful husky hound), do a great job of providing anthropomorphic personalities for the animal characters. I especially like the adorable and frisky artic fox, Pupa, as spoken by Howie Mandel, being the canine Northerner, who at film's end has found his vivacious vixen mate and has sired twelve pups. Pupa has made his trek with the mother bear and her two current cubs through the Arctic in search of nutrition.

I am an oldster, in my seventh decade of life, dwelling here in the northwestern part of Qubec, but I vouchsafe that I enjoy this movie as much as most kids very likely will revel in its story and visual excellence!",1499385600,,2562,4.923611111111111

8307880,1,B001H5X6P8,"I agree this movie isn't for kids. The dialogue just plain sucks. My six year old is into polar bears, and I thought she would love it. The movie shows a dead polar bear, and the capture of another bear by helicopter, and also lots of blood. There were images of bears being abused. The story is narrated by one of the polar bears which is cute, but that's about all it has going for it. I think I will throw this away...too much for a little kid. My whole family hated it, even the adults.",1453766400,,490,4.114583333333333
8307881,1,B001H5X6P8,"My 6 year old and 3 year old boys wanted to watch this movie, and it looked very ""cute"". Oh how looks can be deceiving. This kid movie, is more like a documentary about polar bears. Which is not bad, but some of the content was not for my 3 year old. They are not sheltered by any means, but this movie was a bit graphic. I would definitely recommend renting this movie, and having a parent preview it before it is purchased.",1312588800,3,425,4.132530120481928
8307882,5,B001H5X6P8,"My son is very much into animals. We rented this movie from our local library. It is very education and very creative. The polar bears talk in the film- which my son loved. Instead of a narrator saying this is what polar bears eat, hunt, etc. The polar bear themselves talk about their story. Very fun and educational. We had to buy it!",1257984000,,336,4.349206349206349
8307883,5,B001H5X6P8,"A very cleverly done combination of live-action footage and computer animation.  This engaging tale of a polar bear family's struggle for survival against the backdrop of global warming and the resultant inadequate food supplies will charm the young and 'young at heart'.  The gentle twist at the end is a nice touch.  A few scenes may be jarring to some, but these are handled tastefully and are brief so as not to dwell on the harsh reality of life in todays' arctic.",1241308800,2,469,4.695121951219512
8307884,1,B001H5X6P8,"THIS VIDEO IS NOT, I REPEAT NOT FOR KIDS, within the first 10 minutes you see a ""cute"" seal being eaten by a polar bear with blood all over the place and 10 minutes after that you see the Dad frozen in ice with a hideous face. Imagine explaining this gory imagery to your kids. I know you can't return movies but they should really take this one back. I turned the movie off after the Scary Frozen Dad Face and told my kids the movie was broken. This movie is really a normal wildlife adventure with fake lips slapped on and cheap music sold as a video for kids. They should be ashamed of themselves.",1233532800,11,600,4.181034482758621
