This was a great educational tool for me. Highly  recommended. Even though I am taking phlebotomy, I feel this would
an excellent tool for nursing students, medical assistants and even CNA's. For anyone who has to draw blood.
Thank you so much Mr. White for this DVD.",1495929600,,379,4.921875
8449012,5,B004YXDFJ2,A very basic but very educational video. Its not for everyone but I can say it should be viewed by the student. I don't believe it was made for instructors but for beginners and students who want to know about phlebotomy. I liked it!,1425081600,,233,4.318181818181818
8449013,2,B004YXDFJ2,I am very much disappointed about the video because it's not worth the money. I can learn more by just reading a chapter about Phlebotomy in a book and so much informative videos in the youtube search. All i can say is that i regret buying this!!!,1363737600,4,247,4.276595744680851
