With obesity being such an epidemic in the USA, adults & kids can really benefit from watching this DVD and utilizing the jump rope skills that coach Dennis teaches in this series of videos. I would highly recommend this for all adults and kids alike! If you have a child stuck on the couch or if you have become a couch potato yourself, get this DVD and get your body moving by jumping rope!!",1323561600,2,464,4.344827586206897
