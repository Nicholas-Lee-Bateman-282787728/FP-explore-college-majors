3450530,5,B001AI774S,"Medium Season 4 was the turning point in the series, but not for the bad. We begin to see what happened after Season 3 ended with Allison being exposed and not only how she, but her family had to deal with the publics reaction.  This is one of my favorite seasons and a must for all you die hard Medium fans! The writers are getting better and better and this show is getting better, however, I wish the 5th season started earlier because we need more Medium. This bump in the road for the DuBois family is something all of us can relate to with the Economic hardship that is facing the majority of us.  It also has some great episodes. The two parters of Burn Baby Burn and Wicked Game are among the best. So that being said, I am hoping NBC decides to bring Medium back earlier and leave it on Monday nights since it seems to do better on that night!!",1221523200,5,853,4.195121951219512
3450531,5,B001AI774S,"Another great season of a great show. The tension this season from Allison and Joe needing jobs to money problems to Meghan Doyle really hooked me. It was nice to see more fleshed out family and human problems. However, the writer's strike made for a short and choppy season.  It is too bad Arquette did not get another Emmy nomination this year, she certainly had a lot to do.  Huston did, and hopefully a win this year.
The bonus material on the discs is great, I love the gag reel every season.
Exciting and smart series, I am glad it will be back for season 5 so Patricia has another shot at an Emmy.",1221004800,,604,4.2894736842105265
3450532,4,B001AI774S,"Season 4 of medium, just so happens to be the best season medium has had.. It did get renewed for a fifth season, but it won't air until Jan, unless Nbc cancels one of the new falls show before then..But back to medium!!

This is an amazing season, and worth every penny.. but season this season had 16 episodes, same as season 1, and guess what season 1 costs 22.99. This set is way to expensive for an incomplete season.",1220745600,2,422,4.275
3450533,4,B001AI774S,"Medium is a great show, and this fourth season did have some excellent episodes.  Unfortunately, the writer's strike split this season up on air and ended up cutting it rather short.  In addition, the presence of Sofia Vassilieva (aka Ariel) in this season was mostly off-camera, with the writers/directors only half-handedly trying to explain her absence.  In one episode, we see none of the daughters at all - Allison calls them for breakfast; they don't show up before the scene cuts away.  It seemed like just kind of an odd, slumped season that no doubt was pushed around by the strike and the inevitable off-set needs of teenage actresses.  That being said, I would still recommend the set - I have all the others because it is one of the most well-acted and directed (though not always written) series on television - just wait until it goes on sale.",1216425600,17,857,4.724832214765101
3450534,5,B001AI774S,"Medium is the best show on television.  The production values, writing and amazing cast manage to mesmerize, thought provoke and terrify with tales that are very unique and intelligent.

The cast led by the amazing Patricia Arquette expands this year and only for the better.  The story line since season one plays like a continuous movie.  There are stories each week but underneath is a continuous story that evolves and grabs the viewer.

Patricia Arquette is the ultimate example of how great it is when a film actress brings their talents to tv.  She carries this show totally on her shoulder and her performance is so real and complex one can't help but watch with amazement.

Most shows on network tv are formulaic and predictable.  Hospital shows that are more about romance are a dime a dozen.  This show in a very realistic way shows a very believable family and all they go through as well as the professions of the characters with the sasme realism.

It really bothers me when people give a low review based on Amazon and their performance or the writers strike affecting the # of episodes or even the price.  Reviews here should be based soley on the dvd set of medium - Season 4 and that rates a definite 5 stars.  I can't wait for September and Season 5.",1216425600,13,1269,4.591111111111111
3450535,3,B001AI774S,"This is a wonderful series, but I am guessing that season 4 will come up short of episodes because of the strike mid-year. Shouldn't the pricetag of this be a tad lower? This will be a recurring theme for most of the shows last season.",1216252800,4,235,4.2444444444444445

There are only a few minutes throughout a show that I have a need to do so.  The show uses such a scene as an antecedent thus referring back to the scene verbally.

3450630,5,B001AI774S,Medium was one of my favorite shows when it was being produced and shown originally.  It hasn't lost any of its charm in reruns on Amazon Prime.  In fact it's better than ever!  The only problem I ever had with it was the series finale.  I hated it.  Not because of the writing but because of the storyline.  It would have been better if they had skipped it altogether and we could just imagine that everything was going along as before.  I considered the finale as a dirty trick on the viewers.,1464220800,,495,4.315217391304348

3450703,2,B001AI774S,"I don't believe in ghosts or the like, so, to begin with, I have to suspend my disbelief in order to watch a show like this.  (I don't believe in Santa Claus, either, but I still enjoy Christmas.)  This season seems to be struggling to find stories that fit with what they originally said Allison was or the things they said she could and couldn't do, so they're branching out a bit farther all the time.  The farther they go, the harder I find it to suspend my disbelief and the less sympathy I feel for any of the characters.  The Allison character grows irritatingly more inconsistent, having the courage and fortitude to chase and threaten ghosts and demons with dire consequences, but turning into a spoiled, weepy, whiny brat when real-life things don't go her way.  I don't like her.  I wouldn't want to know her.

What annoys me most of all - and this is a problem with the show in general, not just with this season - is that I've lived in the Phoenix metro area for more than 50 years, and these people don't sound like Phoenicians.  They use the wrong terms.  They don't talk about the right subjects.  The weather's wrong.  The scenery's wrong.  The topography's wrong.  The architecture's wrong.  The flora's wrong.  There are exceptions, but the farther into the show we go, the more generic all of this becomes, until I wonder why they bothered to set it in Phoenix at all.  They could have just set it in your standard NYC or SoCal location and it would have made no difference whatsoever.  Just a few examples:  We don't have district attorneys.  We have city and county attorneys and a state attorney general.  We have no state assembly or assemblymen.  We have a state legislature with senators and representatives.  We've had serial killers and other big crime emergencies, and we don't panic, and local news reporters don't say we do because they know better.  When it rains, we talk about it because it's a relatively rare thing, and it's usually not a polite rain but is often a violent, damaging event that gets discussed to death for a day or 2.  The shameful thing is, it would have taken very little effort for competent production staff to correct such inaccuracies and give the show a genuine Arizona flavor (as long as they went to the trouble of using Arizona for the setting) instead of just supposing that viewers are too inattentive or stupid to notice such things.  Or maybe they didn't realize that, at the time the show was taped, there were more than 3 million people living in the Phoenix area who might just notice the sloppy differences.  Maybe they just figured that anyone who could suspend their disbelief in spooks and mediums could also suspend their belief in the existence of a real Arizona.",1446768000,,2739,4.619047619047619

3450771,4,B001AI774S,"Allison Dubois (Patricia Arquette) is a thirtysomething woman like countless others. She's a wife and a mother to three adorable young girls, Ariel, Bridgette and Marie. Yet Allison struggles with something that sets her apart -- the ability to dream about crimes, communicate with the dead, read minds and other physic abilities. Wanting to use her gift to help others, Allison works with the Phoenix district attorney, Manuel Devalos (Miguel Sandoval) and detective Lee Scanlon (David Cubitt) to try to help solve area crimes -- sometimes after the fact, and other times, before they actually happen.

Unfortunately, Allison's dreams -- more accurately called nightmares -- are often horrifically graphic, and usually not very clear. So, she must relive them, night after night, hoping to gain new details and understanding with each new version.

Allison's daughters -- especially teenage Ariel -- also possess psychic talents of their own, which often troubles their father Joe (Jake Weber). Luckily Joe is basically a laidback type of man, who has come to grips with the fact that he shares his life with four very special women.

At the start of the fourth season, Allison's abilities have been made public, and there's something of an outcry from many, who don't like the idea of such a person working with their local police and legal system. Meanwhile Joe is attempting to strike out on his own after being let go from Aerodytech following the previous season's hostage situation.

Notable Season 4 episodes include ""But for the Grace of God,"" where Allison works with Det. Cynthia Keener (guest star Anjelica Houston) while Ariel begins dreaming about her mother's own teenage years, and the two-part ""Wicked Game,"" where Allison and Cynthia attempt to solve the mystery of Cynthia's own daughter's murder and keep the killer from striking again.

Other notable guest stars include Kelly Preston as Megan Doyle, a new business partner of Joe's who may have her own agenda in mind, and Kelsey Grammar as FBI Agent Edward Cooper.

All in all, ""Medium"" is a great show -- it's a perfect mix of fascinating mysteries and crimes, while balancing the very human Dubois family and all its day-to-day issues.",1250208000,2,2210,5.0911602209944755

3450785,4,B001AI774S,"I have been watching Medium since it first came out and I truly feel it is the best series on TV.  Patricia Arquette and Jake Weber are so believable as Allison and Joe... they make the perfect married couple some times it is difficult to believe they aren't really married.  The only reason I didn't give this FIVE stars is because of the writers strike, the season is kind of on the lite side.  There are only 4 DVDs so you kind of feel like you were cheated on the number of episodes.  BUT, there are some really cool behind the scenes footage (which I really love), and whether there are 4 or 40 DVDs this is some quality writing and acting.

So, if you are a fan of Medium and you haven't already purchased this DVD set, I strongly suggest buying it.  I almost didn't because of the number of episodes, but I am so glad I did.  If you haven't bought any of the season, I strongly suggest you invest in this wonderfully written and executed series.",1234483200,3,952,4.284916201117318

3450787,4,B001AI774S,"If there was a writing strike and they still launch a reduced version, then reduce the price accordingly. Also I am not impressed with the new staff issues which only interfere with the psychic story line. The new staff and environment do not hold the same magnetism which was evident in earlier episodes.

3450789,5,B001AI774S,"I have loved everything about this show from the beginning, the relationship between Allison & Joe, their relationship with their kids and how her ""gift"" works is wonderful and very interesting.  I also enjoy how (much as in real life) those dreams are sometimes misinterpreted and you can see how easy that is to do --- but when it all comes together, it's awesome. The only thing that bugs me is that the DA and the cop they work with, so often blow her off even after seeing so many times how good/useful her ""gift"" is. I like how it's realistic in how she has to pretty much hide her ""gift"" because mainstream society would view you as a total nutcase OR drive you crazy trying to get you to ""read"" for them, etc.
EVERY season of this show has been amazing - I sure hope you see them all at least once, I'm sure you'll enjoy them too.",1227830400,,838,4.270440251572327

The only reason why I got the DVD is because I am such a fan of the series and want to continue my collection. This one though has left me feeling very resentful.

3450791,5,B001AI774S,"I'm so glad to have the fourth season of ""Medium"" on DVD.  This has been my favorite show on TV for 4 years now.  While I tried to watch each episode, I never saw ""Car Trouble"" during broadcast; so as Allison tried to catch a Hispanic killer, only to find he is a model who was on a poster completely engaged me.  ""Lady Killer"" with Patricia Arquette's sister Rosanna Arquette starring as an author who writes a best seller about how older women can get guys turns into an exciting tracking of a serial killer.  ""Drowned World"" that traces a story of a family's dysfunction as it is manifested into dreams of running water built with great unexpected turns.  What Glenn Gordon Caron calls ""story arcs,"" stories that span a number of episodes, brings Angelica Huston as Cynthia Keener, the representative of an organization Ameritips that try to find lost children.  Huston's character builds until her final climactic episodes of ""Wicked Games.""  The season had a tremendous setup from the previous season as both Joe Dubois and Allison find themselves out of work.  Their struggle with family bills, trying to find ways to say no to the children who want money for special things, and having to ask for help from Joe's mother all give this show the duality of the fantastic element of the paranormal and the everyday life of an American family trying to make ends meet.  Joe & Allison's love for each other shines well, particularly in the episodes where Allison gets jealous of Kelly Preston's character who plays Joe's boss on several episodes.  The packaging on the box is excellent.  I particularly appreciate watching the shows without commercial breaks.  While shorter than previous seasons, Season 4 is a welcome addition that will come out from time to time for return engagements on my DVD.  Enjoy!",1224979200,10,1808,4.8122977346278315
3450792,3,B001AI774S,"Medium has been excellent and I was really looking forward to series 4.

However the writer's strike seems to have not only shortened the season (only 16 episodes here as opposed to 21 in season 3), but also some of the 'Medium' creativity was missing.

A few episodes seemed to have sort of weirdly 'scooby doo' endings. Much weaker than previous seasons.

Hopefully season 5 will see a return to the creative and quirky path for Alison. Still worth watching for the best written family and marriage on tv. And they all have lovely hair :)",1224806400,7,540,4.604166666666667
