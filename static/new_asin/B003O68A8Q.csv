8401410,5,B003O68A8Q,"I love Mirabai Holland's dvds. I have several and working out to her has brought me great results. I'm 67 years old. Mirabai's dvd's, along with my work with a physical therapist, have made me stronger and leaner. My sciatica is a great deal better. My overall agility and energy are greatly improved. I needed the challenge as my walking program simply wasn't enough to address my total body fitness. Do yourself a favor. Get on board with Mirabai Holland. You will be glad you did.",1493683200,5,483,4.627906976744186

Both tape 1 and tape 2 are very easy to follow and cover most all muscle groups.  The scenery always makes us jealous.  Great job.",1381190400,5,257,4.08

8401414,5,B003O68A8Q,this series of tapes is great for  older people or for anyone wanting a light workout. i go to the gym for heavier workouts. i am 65 yrs old and for me this would not do for my heavy duty workout but is ok for a nice light home workout on days i do not go to the gym. it would also be good for someone only wanting a light work out period.,1369612800,8,339,3.643835616438356
8401415,5,B003O68A8Q,"I'm an 80 year old polio survivor. I made it for 50 years on braces and crutches; then PPS gradually set in and my arms and shoulders have weakened. Traditional exercise is not appropriate, but these gentle routines have helped alleviate arm-shoulder stiffness and pain. Much appreciated.",1320624000,8,288,5.148936170212766
8401416,5,B003O68A8Q,"I have some physical limitations that prevent me from being able to do ""regular"" yoga.  I was looking for DVDs to help me with stretching and flexibility.  Ms. McCallum's program does that and much more.  Her instructions are clear and easy to follow.  I would definitely recommend her DVDs.",1320537600,9,291,4.877551020408164
8401417,5,B003O68A8Q,I like to chair video because I can't get up and down on the floor like I did a few years ago.  It is done with great music and she does it with clear instructions.,1320192000,8,164,3.6857142857142855
