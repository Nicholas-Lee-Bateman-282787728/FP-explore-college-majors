On the other three copies, nothing came up on any of my three DVD players or my computer.  I purchased the 4 copies over a four or five year period hoping that Eros would finally destroy all the defective batches and come out with one that works.  No such luck.  Eros should know better to continue selling a DVD they know is defective but they don't.

I suggest that anyone interested in this DVD should either wait until a different release comes out or purchase used from someone who has actually watched the DVD and can verify that it plays perfectly beginning to end.",1263859200,2,714,4.298507462686567
