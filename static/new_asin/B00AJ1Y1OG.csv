5439931,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"Kristen Schaal just gave one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen. In one hour, she dismantled all the conventions of comedy, and left nothing in its place. Not only is she completely fearless, but she has an uncanny understanding of audience expectations and how to mercilessly twist those expectations. She does not deliver ""comedy"" in the usual sense, but like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it will become iconic. Her special may not make you laugh now, but it will in the future.",1364774400,10,489,4.764705882352941
5439932,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I loved it!
I would say ignore the negative reviews if you are already familiar and love her work from The Daily Show or Flight of the Conchords.
She does what she does so well.
A genius that takes quirk to the highest levels.
A perfectly peculiar performer with a comedy style and approach so fresh and unique.
I cannot wait to see the full DVD!",1364774400,7,346,4.257575757575758

5439934,1,B00AJ1Y1OG,"There's an hour of no laughs that I won't get back.  What a complete waste of time.  The little kid was mildly amusing, but that only lasted about 30 seconds.",1364774400,5,158,4.233333333333333
5439935,2,B00AJ1Y1OG,"Just watched this and really didn't get it.  Had a couple good moments, but was she trying to channel her inner Andy Kaufman?  Long moments of silence in the audience?  As performance art, maybe it works, but I was hoping for more laughs.",1364774400,7,238,4.488372093023256
5439936,1,B00AJ1Y1OG,not sure what she was trying to accomplish here. It was awkward and not funny...at all. 54 minutes in and I am waiting for it to get in a good laugh,1364774400,7,148,3.806451612903226
5439937,2,B00AJ1Y1OG,"Even though I watched this live performance twice, it just doesn't work for me. It is right to say that Schaal's act was performance art, but at whose cost? To me, the second half of this comedy concert drained the upside of the first half.

This doesn't change my appreciation of Kristen Schaal and her disarming but edgy demeanor. But, in the best window of performance art, nothing I'd care to watch again happened after a very good beginning.",1364947200,4,446,4.6455696202531644
5439938,1,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I like Kristen Schaal.  Her first Comedy Central half-hour special, love her on The Daily Show.  THIS show was unfunny, and painful to watch.  I get that it's supposed to be that way, given that multiple tapings went the same way (according to comments by audience members).  But comics are supposed to make you laugh, or make you think, or evoke some kind of reaction other than ""what the hell's going on here?"" If you do buy this thing, the bit where she starts going on about an ""r-plane""...shut it off there.  It just goes downhill from there. Plummets from a cliff, actually.  You'll miss the funniest part of the show, where a little girl takes the mic for a few minutes to ""show her how it's done"", but it's not worth suffering through what LOOKS LIKE self-destruction.",1364947200,4,776,4.586956521739131
5439939,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"On the lines of Andy Kaufman this DVD is incredibly genius, and misunderstood. More power to you Kristen Schaal I got the jokes!!!",1364860800,4,130,4.695652173913044
5439940,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"Wow, never reviewing before I just had to add in my quick two cents. No, really.
Absurdist comedy, Surreal Comedy, call it what you want it, it is dead. Kristen Schall bring is back to life and does it best in our new generation of
autobiographical comedy. She even references in this in the special. Even the beloved Louis CK does it on his TV show, but that is a TV Show, not a
a ""LIVE AT"" event. (Tell me if you haven't sat there totally perplexed after watching his show sometimes than rewatching it and thinking, holy s*** that was brillant.
People that sit here and complain and write bad reviews are more then likely lovers of knee slappers we have come use to from newer and older comedy greats.
It's unfair to call the act that Schaal just did as ""a waste of time"" ""Worst Show Ever"" ""Bizarre, but not in a good way"" ""disappointing""
to be fair LIVE at the Fillmore is not for everyone, but being one that has watched many of her shows and seen her live,
I don't find it odd that the wool has been pulled over your face. She even paraphrased it best with the opening line,
""this is probably my last stand up show"" She said is best. She's past that, her performances from now on will be that,
not stand up, but Performance Art. Truly original and brillant in my eyes.

5439941,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I loved this! I can't wait to get the chance to show it to my friends ASAP. There are a lot of mixed reviews, and I get that. This special is like nothing else that has aired in a long time, and because of that it tends to get dismissed because it does not fit the expected mold. Some people get the joke, but don't find it funny and that's a valid opinion applicable to any joke. This is one of those rare items that a person is going to have to experience for themselves. Maybe you won't get it and hate it. Maybe you'll get the joke and hate it. Maybe, like me, you'll get the joke, appreciate the craft, and love it.",1364860800,6,620,4.008064516129032
5439942,2,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I originally thought of giving Kristen Schaal's ""Live at the Fillmore"" three stars, but then I realized that I couldn't be that impartial to it. This is one of those things that will make strong opinions in one direction or the other. I liked Schaal's odd Hazel character on ""30 Rock"", and I enjoy her bits for ""The Daily Show"", but I can't seem to appreciate what she is trying to do here.

Granted, I ""get"" what she's doing, in contrast to some of the 5-star reviews that suggest us negative reviewers missed the point. I get it. The whole hour-long special leans heavily into Kaufman territory, and that was supposed to be the joke. Unfortunately it's a joke with an nonexistent set-up and no punchline. The problem lies in the fact that Schaal is really performing two completely different acts here.

In the first half-hour Schaal performs some eccentric-but-traditional routines. She spends a good deal of time (moreso than I enjoyed) discussing the taint, but then has a rather amusing ""audition"" as a magician's assistant and a goofy-enough-to-be-hilarious bit about ghost poop than segues into commercial break. When she returns Schaal performs a corny joke that falls flat and after that point the entire show does an one-eighty. I'll leave the other reviewers to describe what happens next, but needless to say it is an unexpected foray into absurdist comedy that confused me more than anything else. Schaal's later denial of the show on social media and in the press only adds another layer of WTF-ness to the whole thing.

This may be an act that takes some time to be appreciated, like Kaufman or Norm MacDonald's oddly positive anti-roast of Bob Saget. By the end of it, as Schaal does her impersonation of a horse while her partner does his best at turning the place into a barnhall dance, I was pretty certain Schaal was either some sort of genius or was trying her best to disassociate herself with Comedy Central.

I think I would have appreciated this more if the whole show was as strange as the second half, or as eccentric as the first, but not both. I guess sometimes I like to laugh without having to think about it too hard.",1364860800,6,2150,4.710106382978723
5439943,2,B00AJ1Y1OG,"It really is unfortunate that I have to give this special such a low rating. The first half of Kristen Schaals first special is actually quite funny. A bit ""out there"" and perhaps not everyones cup of tea but good laughs to be found nonetheless. If long(10+min) jokes/rants about taints are not something you enjoy then feel free to just stop reading and move on. However after one joke goes poorly shortly after the thirty minute mark, Schaal appears to fall completely to pieces. She mumbles on and on about the pronunciation of airplane. It was very bizarre, she went off stage for a short period of time and you could tell this was not the same comedian when Schaal came back on the stage. Seemed to be extremely nervous for the  rest of the show and none of her jokes were landing. As I said before it's too bad because the first half was hilarious.",1364860800,4,854,4.4743589743589745
5439944,1,B00AJ1Y1OG,"This entire show was horrible. She is painfully unfunny, at one point fleeing the stage to escape the silence of the audience. The first half of the show was unconventionally entertaining, but the second half collapsed into a terrible descent into unfunny randomness. Kristen Schaal did a twenty minute bit about the human taint, which, later in the show, a girl of about thirteen or fourteen came on stage to repeat. I found that to be in terrible taste and a form of child abuse. She attempted to pronounce the word ""airplane"" for five minutes, repeatedly pronouncing it ""areplane"" in an increasingly pathetic manner. The entire thing was unfunny and ended with a ten minute sing and dance section of her dancing like a prospector while a man sang ""Kristen Schaal is a horse"" over and over and over again. Only those five words repeated to no music over and over again. She herself admitted that the show was a failure and that she was certain it would never air. If it's an April Fool's joke, and it did air on the day, I saw no punchline, just a desperate woman dancing as the audience silently cleared out of their seats and left. She also admitted that her act, which was full of toilet humor, curse words, and inappropriate sexual comments about felatio, among other things, was probably inapropriate for the children all throughout the audience who no doubt came to see the woman who'd done a Sunday cartoon show and not a disgusting rant on her sexual behavior. I'm glad i didn't pay for it and nobody should.",1364860800,5,1518,4.646840148698884
5439945,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I am really surprised by the amount of people who didn't realize every bit of her show was scripted. The alleged disastrous second half where her jokes are bombing and she twice leaves the stage was all a put-on and intentional. You were supposed to feel uncomfortable watching it. How could anyone actually believe all that ""mental meltdown"" stuff was for real?  Duh. I guess that is a compliment to her talent as she obviously fooled many people. I understand she did two shows and both were exactly the same. I don't think it was a coincidence that this premiered on April Fools Day. I feel many reviewers here simply did not quite understand what Kristen was doing during the second half of her new special. I don't see how anyone could not laugh out loud during the first half.  This is very funny stuff.  I see many hated it but I thought it was hilarious.  To each his own.  This is daring comedy that reminds me a bit of the things the late Andy Kaufman used to do.  Not everyone found his antics funny either but I did. I have watched this show all the way through a second time and found it even funnier than the first time.  The bit with the little girl in the audience is hysterical. I also liked it when Kirsten went bonkers and started destroying things in the dressing room. Her exuberance and agility during the ""Kristen Schaal is a horse"" bit at the end is amazing to watch. Heck, all of it was funny. This is inspired lunacy that some misunderstand but for the rest of us is wonderfully funny. This woman is brilliant.  I sincerely feel sorry for anyone who didn't like this. I had a wonderful time and will watch it again very soon! Please goto vulture.com and read what it says about her comedy special there,",1364860800,3,1729,4.4321766561514195
5439946,1,B00AJ1Y1OG,"Just watched this on Comedy Central, it was painfully bad. Bizarre, but not in a good way. I really don't see the humor in contriving a bombed comedy act. If you're a fan of her on the Daily Show then don't ruin your perception of her by paying for this terrible performance. I hope they didn't charge that poor audience to sit through that dreadful show, you could only feel pity for them as the fled their seats at the end.",1364774400,6,425,4.2592592592592595

8552440,4,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I think Kristen has done an awesome job here, but I can see a bit why people are complaining about the 2nd half. I think she is still great, but definitely not as much as the first. Still love her comedy though!
Btw, first time reviewer, I just had to say something about this bc I enjoyed it so :)",1382227200,,298,3.9833333333333334
8552441,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"...If you're willing to trust her and just let it happen, because this isn't like other stand-up shows out there. It's surreal and often brilliant. The tiniest joke is developed into an amazing performance with perfect commitment and skill. I think Kristen has a background in theater, I know she has one in sketch- in this she makes use of both and goes beyond the typical stand-up format into something very different. If you don't like silly or strange humor, this isn't for you. If you do, you'll never be able to shut up about this comedy special. I haven't. It's been months. I've lost many friendships. My boyfriend hates me.",1368748800,,632,4.702702702702703
8552442,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"This was kind of like an hour long version of Kristen Schaal is a Horse. At first it is just solidly funny and absurd comedy. In the middle you might question what is happening. You might ask yourself, ""Is this real?"" Or maybe you'll be saying something like: ""This doesn't seem like a very well thought out comedy routine."" After this delirium there are still many solid jokes that fill the swell of mounting absurdity. By the end you'll realize that Kristen Schaal always was, is, and will forever be, a horse.",1367280000,,512,4.576086956521739
8552443,1,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I am a long-time Kristen Schaal fan and quite looked forward to her first special.  Alas, it turned out to be the sort of thing that 80%+ of her potential audience would probably hate.  Although it starts off well enough, it descends into a Kaufmanesque pit that in the end simply fails to be entertaining.  A small minority of people will love this odd deliberately awful performance, but for most people, even devoted enthusiasts of stand-up, it will either bore or irritate.

Had this been a 10 minute routine rather than an hourlong special, the concept might have worked.  Or it also might have worked had the deliberately awful part been entertainingly bad.  As it is, I rather suspect many who saw it originally on TV turned it off around the 45 minute mark.  I made it to 55 minutes or so myself, but in the end, I had to ask myself whether or not I could spend those five minutes better.  I could.

Schaal is an extremely talented comedian and if this is the only thing of hers you've seen, don't judge her based solely on this.  Give her another shot.",1367280000,4,1061,4.479166666666667
8552444,5,B00AJ1Y1OG,"I watched the special when it aired on Comedy Central and I, like many others, were a little confused on what happened. But I was still impressed, and being a big fan of Schaal I appreciated that her talent was recgonized with an hour long special. Also, the fact that she had to basically play along with the whole unhappy feelings toward the outcome of the show via all interviews and social media conversations, that also made the show even more entertaining when all brought together. I would have given it probably a 4 without purchasing the actual DVD.

Now that I have watched the DVD, I enjoyed the performance even more and I think it made more sense and was more encompassing so that those who didn't like what it was ""premised"" on would appreciate some of the other jokes of hers that were cut out due to time restraints. She is a very physical performer, and I think that most people want comedy that is vocal: they hear it, recgonize the joke, and then laugh because it sounds funny. Schaal, especially here, uses a high amount of physical humor to pair with her fresh comedic ideas. So, if you can't pay attention to what's going on and just want the special on in the background for the noise of jokes, this is NOT something you will probably enjoy.

Yes her special was different, but different doesn't necessarily mean ""bad"" or ""wrong"" like so many people seem to think. I believe Schaal achieved what she sought to do with this performance, and that is an accomplishment in and of itself, and makes for a good comedic show.

**Side note: Not to mention the extras within the DVD are great! You get her comedy central presents, her john oliver special, AND 3 great sketches from her Daily Show apperances. I had to pay for the 2 previously mentioned specials via Itunes, so for them to be included on the disc is a great deal and will allow you to further delve into the comedy stylings of Kristen Schaal.

So with the extra content from her show, the fact that I already enjoyed the show the 1st time around, and all the great extras included on the DVD it was an obvious 5 star product for me.",1367020800,3,2112,4.463730569948186
8552445,1,B00AJ1Y1OG,"This comedy special was a disaster I'm sad to report :(

For such a seasoned comic its strange that she didn't calculate that
when you spoof your own ""wreck"" onstage, there HAS to be a resolution!
Meaning that one's fake screw up onstage has to be obvious to the
audience, UNLESS there is true brilliance to the gaff of making the
audience believe that the star is really screwing up.

See, when the audience genuinely believes the star has erred, then
the resolve has to be brilliant to make the viewer feel like they ""get""
the joke at the end, and therefore shouldn't feel sorry for the star.

Her special was going well, right up until she faked her
mispronunciation of Our-Plane.  It went nowhere.
She took it nowhere.

Like an unfunny version of Andy Kaufman

Kristen, a seasoned comedienne should know IT HAS TO BE FUNNY TO
BE FUNNY.

It was just dumb.  And not even in a funny way. Really hurts since I was such a big fan and really liked all her work on The Daily Show.",1365638400,2,977,4.388888888888889
