2657226,5,B000IHYXKS,Just the thing for a cold winter night in front of the fire.  The acting is superb and it's fun to see some well-known names when they were younger.,1195603200,2,148,4.103448275862069
2657227,1,B000IHYXKS,"We ordered this DVD because we saw it described in a PBS catalog as having ghost stores with intricate, twisted plots.  We're not into the blood and gore, slasher movies, so this seemed like a great alternative.  On the positive side, some of the stories did build up the suspense.  It was very hard to follow the plots to the stories,though, and there was always a huge letdown at the end.  We suffered through all six stories simply because we had paid for the DVD, and we kept hoping the stories would get better.  They didn't.  Ghost stories don't need to be bloody, but they do need to be spooky.  These stories definitely were not.

Two ghost stories that do have twisted, intricate plots and are genuinely spooky are The Innocents, starring Deborah Kerr, made in 1961, and The Others, starring Nicole Kidman, made in 2001.",1193184000,7,829,4.63013698630137
2657228,5,B000IHYXKS,"Shades of Darkness is a British production which was shown in the US on PBS' ""Mystery"" about 1984.  I enjoyed it then and waited anxiously but fruitlessly for a rerun, so I am glad that at last it is available on DVD.

Each segment of Shades of Darkness is about an hour long and is drawn from short stories by Edith Wharton, Elizabeth Bowen, and other luminaries.  The scripts are literate and faithful to the original stories.

The most pleasing thing about these short films is their ability to create an atmosphere of creepiness mounting to horror without having to fall back on the old horror movie standbys of fanged monsters and bloodshed.  These are stories of people going about their ordinary lives who gradually become aware of the presence of the supernatural.  My favorite episode is ""Afterward"" by Edith Wharton, where the viewer, like the principal character, doesn't even recognize the ghost is a ghost when it appears.

If you are accustomed to seeing horror delivered through the blows of an axe or by screaming monsters you will find Shades of Darkness just as frightening but far more equivocal and intriguing.",1179360000,20,1130,4.854166666666667

2657232,4,B000IHYXKS,"I'd been wanting to see this series for years and now (most of) it's finally on DVD.  Very gloomy, shot on-location ghosts stories: decaying country houses, seaside graveyards, muddy roads, but all done with the utmost respect for the material and the genre.  I actually haven't watched the final tale (""The Demon Lover"") yet.

The story ""The Maze"" left me indifferent, and has an embarrassingly directed sex/wood-cutting scene, and lots of that awful tinkly piano music that's supposed to sound suspenseful.  This is NOT characteristic of the other tales, whose music is much more appropriate and less distracting.  The acting is actually quite good, but I just couldn't get into it.  Even the hedge maze is disappointing--more like a halfhearted smattering of old bushes.  Oh well.

""Afterward"" is excellent (I'm quite a fan of the Edith Wharton tale): perfect location, period detail, just the right moodiness, smartly underused musical scoring, etc.  The woman who plays the main character is outstanding, and we get a real sense of her choking, mute dread--the devastating truth she's unable to articulate or fully understand.  The actor who plays her husband is stiff but serves his purpose and disappears soon enough.

""The Intercessor"" and ""Bewitched"" are both beautifully done, BEAUTIFULLY acted, and more emotionally involving than might seem possible with ghost stories.  I was really impressed.  Eileen Atkins OWNS her role, and makes it something deeply ambiguous.  These tales aren't really about ghosts; they're about the trials of the living, for which the ghosts provide poignant counterpoint.  (Note: One of these two tales is so brilliantly told you might not even realize there's no ghost in it!).

""The Lady Maid's Bell.""  Not the strongest of the tales, but very atmospheric.  As the first on the lineup it provides a nice prolog to the others, establishing mood and tone.  And I enjoyed the ambiguous ending.

As stated in another review, the pacing of these six mini-movies is rather slow, but not too slow.  We're allowed to absorb and contemplate the environments, and get the sense that the characters are moving through actual time, not skipping from one jarringly edited scene to the next.  If you long for the days when you first read Poe, if you remember most fondly not Halloween itself but the bleak quiet weeks leading up to it, when you explored that old barn in the meadow or made up ghost stories around the fire, believing every word, these DVDs are for you.",1169510400,27,2496,5.036585365853658
2657233,4,B000IHYXKS,"Shades of Darkness is a 1980s British production centering on tales of the supernatural. It was produced by June Wyndham Davies and is an ITV production. Initially there were seven hour-long episodes produced in 1983 and there were an additional two hour-long episodes produced in 1984 and screened in 1986. This DVD collection only has six episodes.

Here is a listing of the episodes:
The Lady's Maid's Bell
The wonderful Joanna David stars in this creepy episode as Miss Hartley who is hired as a lady's maid for Mrs. Brympton. Initially Miss Hartley finds her employer and the other staff to be quite amiable, and learns that the prior lady's maid, Emma Saxon, had died after serving Mrs. Brympton for 20 years. Miss Hartley then begins to experience strange encounters with a ghostly figure. Who or what is this entity and what does it want of Miss Hartley?

The Intercessor
Mr. Garvin (John Duttine) is a writer who seeks a quiet place to write his book. He goes to live with the Falshaw family who have no children, so that he can have some peace and quiet. Instead he hears a crying child at night and encounters the spirit of a dead girl and this moves him to uncover the sad tragedy that unfolded at the Falshaw farm in the past.

Afterward
A rich American and his wife move into an old English manor reputed to be haunted, although the nature of the haunting is a little strange - those who see the ghost are not aware that it is a ghost they see until some time has passed since the encounter. The American's wife is soon to have a similar experience under tragic circumstances.

The Maze
At the end of WW II, Catherine Frode (Francesca Annis) and her family move back into Catherine's childhood home, a place that holds unhappy memories for Catherine. She insists that her daughter Daisy not venture out into the maze near the home but of course Daisy breaks this rule and tells her mother she had met a man in the maze. Who is this strange man and what are his intentions?

Bewitched
Set in a little hamlet along the English coast, the story centers on a young woman who is presumed by the local villagers to be a witch. After her death, villagers see her walking along the shore. Eileen Atkins plays a local housewife who believes her husband is wasting away due to his affair with the ghost of the dead woman. This prompts the village minister (Alfred Burke) to probe into the circumstances of her death in the hope of freeing the troubled spirit.

The Demon Lover
A creepy tale of long-lost love. It is 1941 and Kathleen Drover (Dorothy Tutin) has just packed her family up from London and moved to the country. Watching her son and his girlfriend makes her think back to her younger days when she was in love with an RAF pilot who was killed in 1916. She also inadvertently finds a note which mentions the promise made, that no matter what happens, she and her pilot lover will be reunited 25 years later.

Final thoughts - I bought this DVD used from a second hand bookstore, but it plays well and the audio and picture quality are good, despite the dated production details.  I'd recommend this anthology for fans of atmospheric supernatural dramas.",1169337600,,3169,4.566901408450704

8145539,1,B000IHYXKS,"All these rave reviews, and I can't fathom why.

Pros:
The sets were nice and creepy. the acting was very solid.

Cons:
The stories were very dull. Some stories were interesting, but either had a dumb ending leaving you frustrated you sat through it just to get that kind of a lousy pay off, or the ending made no sense at all.

When my family watched it, we ended up pulling a Mystery Science Theater 3000 and made jokes through the whole ""The Maze"" story just to make it interesting. This story was odd that everyone, even the men, wore bright red lipstick. Oh what fun we had with that! Plus, in every new scene, something was a brilliant red. Sometimes the little girl's hair bows, sometimes a car, sometimes the trims on clothing, etc.

My advice? Buy something else.",1302480000,4,772,4.492857142857143

8145541,5,B000IHYXKS,"I bought this DVD because I was scrambling for any British production to watch on television. British productions always have excellent writing and production values. And then I found ""Shades of Darkness' I love ghost stories, especially British ghost stories and this DVD set certainly delivers. The stories deal with the human soul and its complexities and the price one has to pay if you betray it. Great casting as well. The British have a way of putting the spectator right in the middle of the drama as though you are there as well. I reccommend this DVD to anyone who appreciates great story telling.",1200355200,2,607,4.79047619047619
