8388752,1,B00359FGGG,This lady's voice is annoying and she is an absolute idiot......then again so am I for actually paying money to watch the video!,1364083200,3,128,4.608695652173913
8388753,5,B00359FGGG,Becky is so great! This is a very informative DVD for beginners! I also enjoy Becky's down to earth style!,1341705600,,106,4.35

8388755,1,B00359FGGG,"This video belongs on YouTube. It's that short and poorly done. It is made at home with extremely basic computer and camera work, and Becky has no script, and no gift for speaking without one. This video MIGHT be worth it if it cost a dollar, but is a total and complete rip-off for $30. It was awful. I'm sorry to have to say it, because I'm sure Becky knows what she's doing and is a very nice lady, but she has no business making instructional videos and selling them for the amount of money that would lead one to believe it's a high-quality production packed with excellent information. It is neither! DON'T BUY!!!",1333929600,9,619,4.43859649122807
8388756,1,B00359FGGG,"This video is far too basic to be of any assistance to anyone with more than a real basic knowledge of horses and hoof care. I found her kindergarten attitude somewhat abrasive, and was totally disgusted when she mis-named the parts of the horse. That said, if all you want is a beginners (or kindergarten) version of hoof trimming, I guess it's okay for that. I feel like it was a total waste of my money.",1329436800,14,406,4.355263157894737
