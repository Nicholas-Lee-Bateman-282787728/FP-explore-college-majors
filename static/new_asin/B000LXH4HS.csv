2716093,5,B000LXH4HS,"I'm in this!  Okay, in something that can't even really be called a cameo, but nonetheless...in one of the early scenes the host goes to a 'costume party' where almost no one else dresses up; he starts looking at all the people there and describing them to the audience, ""Suit, suit, suit, suit, suit, a couple of dresses, suit, almost a costume, suit, pirate.""

And yes, I am the pirate.

I've never been prouder.  It was a benefit for the Hong Kong ballet.

And, dammit, if they hadn't been filming the show, I would have won!

Oh, but about the DVD, they explore the seldom seen parts of HK, from some lovely kayaking in the outlying islands, to a fantastic traditional village house; they visit local racconteur Nuri Vittachi and a fascinating and somewhat strange photographer/visual-performance artist identified only as Amy; they go shopping in Mong Kok, one of the most densely crowded places on Earth; they ride along with the marine police on a night patrol to catch smugglers (which they don't actually manage to do), and they meet a kung-fu artist/stuntman.  It's loads of fun, and I saw parts of Hong kong that I hadn't seen here in real life having been here 17 years!  But it was rather odd that the majority of people they met here were NOT CHINESE.  Sure, there are a lot of expats living here, but you'd think that more locals would give you more of a local sense of the place.

And keep an eye out for the pirate.  (The Marine Police still haven't brought me in!  HAHAHAHAHA!)",1177113600,,1495,4.578947368421052
2716094,1,B000LXH4HS,"1. The theme was not corresponding to the title of this DVD - a proper title would have been ""the life of the native people of S. Africa/ Cape Town"".

2. The duration of the DVD is only 46 mins(...fortunately!!) instead of 60 mins written on the back of the DVD package.",1175731200,3,270,4.1923076923076925
8164854,3,B000LXH4HS,"Lonely Planet is a travel series in which the host (either Toby or Asha) heads to a city and interacts with different people in the city. This is not a guide to the sites of a city (if you're looking for a guide to London, I recommend Rick Steves or Globe Trekker Ultimate London). It's more about exploring a particular city's culture.

After getting off the London Tube, Asha met the host of a radio show. They headed to a protest against global warming. The people at the protest claimed that if nothing was done about global warming, London would be 6 feet underwater in 50 years. Next, Asha headed to Piccadilly Circus where she met some people who wanted to bring back the ""Chap Movement"" (which is essentially old-fashioned British culture).

Later, Asha rode a double-decker bus. The bus had a conductor. The conductor, who was a black British man, entertained the customers by playing the harmonica. Asha stopped by a nightclub in Soho. The nightclub had some drag queens (I'm not homophobic, but Lonely Planet seems to have some LGBT obsession). Asha concluded the night by riding a monster truck through the streets of London.

In the second half of the episode, Asha and a friend went on a scavenger hunt along the bank of the River Thames. She also went to a Hindu festival and a wildlife preserve.

Most of the activities and the people she met were interesting. The scavenger hunt was a waste of 5 minutes. I didn't want to see drag queens at a nightclub. Other than that, this was a decent episode. It showed London from a different perspective.",1404604800,,1561,4.644927536231884
8164855,4,B000LXH4HS,"In the Lonely Planet Series, Toby Amies, a British travel guide, seeks to meet six random people in a foreign city. This is NOT a guide to the attractions in a particular city. However, it shows a different perspective of a city.

Tokyo has a nice skyline. At night, it looks like Vegas. The first person Toby met was an attractive Japanese girl (who spoke English). He also met a Japanese scientist. The episode starts boring, but gets interesting as it progresses. Toby went to a sushi restaurant in the downtown area. The next person he met was a female photographer who took him to the red light district and then the batting cages. Since Toby is British, he knew nothing about baseball. He swung the baseball bat like a cricket bat.

Toby later hung out with some male escorts. Ironically, many of their clients were attractive women. Since he missed the last train home, he stayed at a ""capsule"" hotel. The next person he met took him to a Shinto Shrine and then a Manga-themed caf, which I thought was a little weird. Overall, I enjoyed this episode. If you're interested in Japan, I also recommend Rudy Maxa's Japan episode.",1400803200,,1132,4.626865671641791

8164857,3,B000LXH4HS,"Low-tech, low budget and poor visual quality yet humerous and delightful.  You will see parts of Mexico City not in your normal travel books and places you may or may not want to visit, especially if you are a a cautious traveler. Complex topics, such as the role of death in Mexican society and the multifaceted nature of the Day of the Dead celebrations are treated in a light-handed manner.  It's not unpleasanst yet strange to watch a young mexican, in a party-like situation, rub honey from a bucket over his almost nude body and then pour the remainder over his head to run down his torso while the audience drinks honeyed drinks.  I laughed throughout this hour long video, yet that may say more about me than it does about the video.  It seems a bit overpriced so we borrowed it from the local library. It would be great running in the background for a Cinco de Mayo or Day of the Dead party (Nov. 1-2).",1257638400,,911,4.437125748502994
8164858,3,B000LXH4HS,"OK, given the plethora of Lonely Planet guides, Britz, Rough Guides and all the rest out there I suppose the idea of doing yet another standard guide to a world city like Berlin would of been a tad pointless. Not without some merit perhaps, but a bit blase. So the city is given the 6ix Degrees treatment whereby a host - in this instance Toby Amies - starts off with a single well connected person and essentially follows the links to other people and ultimately the idea is to present an off beat view of a place. The series is reasonably extensive and basically if you buy one and like the style the others are a safe bet too.

This particular episode sees our host explore golf but not as you know it. Instead it's now an urban extreme sport! There are encounters with a performance artist, chess boxing, squatters and 'the Bernie Ecclestone of Berlins cockroach racing scene'. And those snippets of info will probably tell you if this light hearted and truth to tell not overly practical city guide is for you. Personally I find the off the wall methodology kind of fun but then I'm not about to travel to these places and attempt to use these DVD's as a guide. I view them more as an enjoyably pointless exercise. If that sounds like something that might float your boat grab one of the series and check it out for yourself, they are often available embarrasingly cheap.",1256774400,,1376,4.504
8164859,3,B000LXH4HS,"As part of the 6ix Degrees Lonely Planet city guide series this 47 minute travelogue caught my eye due to having been to New Zealand and being blown away by the physical beauty of the place. Having been in Auckland all too briefly I thought this would be a good way of reminiscing and also getting ideas for what I'd missed.

As per the rest of the series the idea here is that starting with a single point of contact the host gets around to all sorts of quirky 'insider only' adventures. The trick here is that Auckland, while a nice enough city and a gateway to many of the delights of the North Island of NZ, struggles to come up with enough quirky aspects of interest to flesh out even this brief DVD. It's actually the sort of city that might have fared better with a more traditional approach taking in the proximity of the apparently gorgeous Bay of Island (I say apparently as I've not been there myself), the wine growing regions to the south and the awesome natural attractions that are within a days drive of the city such as Rotorua and it's geysers.

Normally I love any sort of travelogue style show and while off beat even this series often gives me inspiration to travel to different places, but I feel this DVD doesn't really do justice to a beautiful city nestled in a beautiful country. Thus - three stars only for this one.",1256774400,,1343,4.411290322580645
8164860,4,B000LXH4HS,"The Lonely Planet city guide series the idea of you needing one point of contact to get to know a city. Hence the 6ixDegrees part of the title. Now the trick with this series is that it attempts to show you how once you have a single point of contact things can spiral from there so that you meet all sorts of weird and wonderful people and various off-beat and insider only glimpses of a city.

And that brings us to the crux of the matter. These are not guides to a city telling you the best deal you can score on a tour of the Tower of London. Any idiot can get themselves on a 24 hour hop on/hop off bus tour. I know - I did it! This series aims at delving a little deeper into various niche aspects of the city in question. The product descpription for this particular instalment is very good as it gives you an idea of the shennanigans host Asha Gill gets up to in this 47 minute travelogue.

Personally, having seen a number of the 'must see' sights of London already I took a bit of a shine to this instalment and in fact the series itself as I am totally onboard with the whole concept of quirky travel. If you are after a more serious explanation of what to see and how to see it you would probably be better off grabbing a city guide from either Lonely Planet or one of their competitors.

So I give this four stars for a short blast of London weirdness, but if you were not aware of what you were getting then yes, it would be a real disappointment.",1256774400,,1461,4.1192982456140355

8164862,1,B000LXH4HS,"This is not what I expected.  It is like those six degrees of separation shows where one person encounters another person, etc.  It should not be listed as a travel guide at all.  It's more about these quirky people than it is about London. We wanted a travel guide that highlighted places not to miss.  This is full of weird little places only people who live there would ever go to.  Very disappointing.",1196035200,,405,4.493150684931507
8164863,2,B000LXH4HS,"I was hoping this would be a good overview of things to see on my trip in Hong Kong.  But it didn't really offer much information.

The host is nice enough, but there wasn't much info about things to see, places to go, what to expect, etc...

If you're looking for something to help plan your trip.  Save your money.  On the other hand, the Frommers guide is quite helpful.",1188432000,,373,4.271428571428571
