This is actually the second film of the 2 Operation condor films. The one that the american  market claims to be OC2 was made back in 1986, whereas this one is from the  nineties.

905388,5,6304681518,"This is classic Jackie Chan, and it's better than many of the others for one reason: it has some cool stuff in it besides the stunts! Not only does it have the classic Jackie fights and some truly excellent stunts, but it  is also very entertaining and has a cohesive story.

905390,4,6304681518,"I love to watch Jackie Chan in action, the only reason this DVD didn't get full 5 stars is, as I prefer to watch the movies in Chinese with English sub titles, better sound.  Apart from that Top Film.",941500800,,200,4.128205128205129
905391,5,6304681518,This movie was much better then Armor of the Gods.  It was filled with mad action from start to finish.  The wind tunnel and whole warehouse action scene is some of the best fight scenes he has ever done.,916876800,,204,4.205128205128205
905484,4,6304681518,"A good Jckie Chan formula movie. There is plenty of action with Jackie climbing walls, fightng mutiple vilians, and a quite good storyline backing the action.

905487,4,6304681518,"What do you get when you mix the gadgets of James Bond, the scenery and story like Indiana Jones and martial arts master Jackie Chan? You get Operation Condor. This one has it all, tons of action that includes some really fantastic scenes of Chan's particular style of 'making everything look cool', some balancing comedy, exciting adventure and even more.

Let's be honest, the main reason to watch Jackie Chan movies is for the impressive action, so don't expect a particularly unique story with excellent dialogue and Oscar performance acting. It's pretty clear that Chan doesn't like to take anything too seriously, and when you watch this movie you shouldn't either and you'll probably enjoy a classic action driven, comedy laced Jackie Chan flick.",1399593600,2,753,5.07258064516129

He soon discovers that he is not the only one searching for the gold; there are people willing to kill to get their hands on it. ""Operation Condor"" is a very funny Jackie Chan movie. This movie has all the Jackie Chan charm. Great fight scenes, stunts and action but also lots of slapstick comedy to keep you happy. ""Operation Condor"" is a funny and great movie, and I recommend it.",1266278400,,576,4.495238095238095

905564,5,6304681518,"I watched this movie as a child, loved it, and today it stands as one of Chan's finest. I love Chinese humor, it's really hilarious! Jackie is full of portraying a humorous, yet serious role. He is a great lead role here, with two or three excellent sidekicks. Embarking on hunt for treasure was never this fun!",1214265600,,311,4.473684210526316
905565,4,6304681518,"Jackie Chan's hugely enjoyable romp Operation Condor - Armour of God 2 sees him on the trail of Nazi gold in the desert in a plot that's no more than an excuse for several spectacular stunts - and this contains some of Chan's most impressive stuntwork. His most expensive HK picture, it's also one of his most enjoyable in its uncut version, but sadly this Miramax/Dimension version has typically cut 14 minutes from the Hong Kong version (the US theatrical version actually cut 26 minutes!). It ain't art, but it is fun, and some of the stunts in the massive underground set have to be seen to be disbelieved.

Unfortunately, this a disappointing DVD all round. It's not just that UK label Hong Kong Legends' excellent Hong Kong DVDs have raised the bar in terms of extras and picture quality, this Dimension release is the dubbed and heavily edited US cut. The UK PAL  release is uncut, but  sadly dubbed and  not the best of  transfers. A budget title in every sense of the word, you're much better off sticking to the Hong Kong releases.",1210896000,,1041,4.605405405405405

905617,5,6304681518,"I think it is unfair for the anti-dubbing purists to give this dvd a low ratings simply because it is a dubbed version.  If you don't like dubbing, nobody is forcing you to buy this.  IMHO, there is good dubbing and bad dubbing, and the dubbing on this movie is actually quite good.

Unfortunately, this dvd doesn't have any special features.  However, it is a nice true widescreen presentation.

The movie has lots of humor, action, great stunts, fantastic fights, pretty girls, interesting locations.  It also has one of the best chase scenes I've ever seen.

This is supposed to be a sequel to Armour of God, but it stands on it's own, and I'd have to say I thought it was the better of the two.  One I'll definitely enjoy watching again.",1169769600,,741,4.518796992481203
905618,3,6304681518,"Jackie Chan is a physical genius and this,together with a sense of comedy and an air of winning self-deprecation,help set his movies apart from those of other action stars such as the wooden Van Damme and the pompous dirigible Seagal. The physical skills are well in evidence here as are the comedy traits -although personally I find them less well showcased this time around
Operation Condor is clearly an expensive movie and makes widespread use of well photographed North African and European locations ,in its tale of Chan and some female colleagues hunting abandoned Nazi gold in the face of opposition from Arab terrorists and one of the gold's former owners.
There are draggy bits in the middle when the story gets bogged down in broad comedic interludes ,and the dubbing throughout is execrable. All is forgiven when it comes to the climax -an elongated fight scene in a wind tunnel that has flair ,pace and panache.
The end credits show the injury sustained by Chan in making the movie when a stunt went wrong-proof that here is an action star who does not stint on placing himself on the line .Four stars for Chan -and marked down only for the dubbing and the misfiring comedy scenes which simply don't travel well to Occidental audiences",1059436800,3,1248,4.809302325581395

905620,5,6304681518,"This dvd is worth the money! I'm Italian and there are a few Jackie's movies translated into my language, luckily there are the english versions... but I also like to watch them in chinese with eng subtitles...
This is a really good movie, with a bit of Indiana Jones, a bit of James Bond and Jackie's funny humor. The background is also interesting and whimsical: the desert, the nazi's base... ok, the story is not so original, but the situations that came out with Jackie and the 3 girls are funny.
And the wind tunnel scene (though it is a fake... they are not flying, there are wires to pull them around...) is GREAT!!!
A challenging movie, that gave some problems during the filming, sand was everywhere and Jackie really got hurt folling from the hanging chain in the nazi's base and dislocated his sternum...
And hey, you can watch this film just because Jackie is always the n. 1",1043366400,5,888,4.55625
905621,5,6304681518,This film isn't as good as its previous one but it's still good! I am sorry but i can't tell you the plot because I'll give everything away! Highlight: the fight in the wind tunnel.,1037059200,,181,4.2
905622,5,6304681518,"This is a confusing situation. now ""Operation Condor"" is also known as ""Armour Of God 2: Operation Condor"" whilst ""Operation Condor 2: The Armour Of The Gods"" is also known as ""Armour Of God"". Why is this? Well Armour Of God 1+2 was their original title but Armour  2 came out before Armour of God 1 and so Armour of God 2 was named Operation Condor. a Great film!",1036886400,,364,4.27536231884058

There is a completely new soundtrack featuring modern music ( which doesn't sute the film ) and during an excellent acrbatic end fight, having funky music ( like U.S version of Black mask )in an end fight is crazy, makes me mad, hk fights should not hav music, except maybe the very modern films that don't need sound affects but O.C needs to hav the sound affects to make the fights more realistic, that is waht this dvd is lacking of. But this film is a cracker, about 5 fights mybe more with an unbaliveble end fight, great film, poor dvd.",1023580800,,644,4.201612903225806
905624,4,6304681518,"I bought this DVD knowing it would be cut like most US films of Jackie's.  The reason I bought it is because Jackie dubs his own voice - I just love his voice, whether he is speaking Cantonese, Mandarin or English!  It just adds so much more to the enjoyment of his movies I feel.  And there are cut scenes - the most obvious a very funny scene in the desert with Jackie trying to give his female off-siders water without their bumbling Arab captors knowing!  Notwithstanding all this, this film is one of Jackie's best with amazing stunts and the fight scene in the wind tunnel has to be seen to be believed.  A must see, whether it is this version or the original uncut Cantonese with English S/T.",1007337600,4,699,4.346153846153846
905695,4,6304681518,"How could they?! - This American re-relase (complete with snazzy titles) has been cut to ribbons in a vain attempt to keep it serious! How dare they!! slapstick humour IS jackie chan. Whole scenes are actually removed from the film in order to appeal to po-faced Steven segal fans! Having seen the original version on TV, i rushed out to buy it, then being disappointed by the edited version. Its ironic that the humour is censored, rather than the violence.
Still, despite these drawbacks, Its one of Jackie's finest. Big budget (without ruining it like rush hour 2!), very funny, and highly original - the fight in the wind tunnel is both spectacular and hilarious at the same time!.
Its a bit of a downer that its been edited to tone down the humour, but its still a superb Chan flick.",1002585600,22,788,4.595744680851064
905696,5,6304681518,"Chan goes all out with mind blowing stunts and tons of action and fight sequences.  This is a true gem in the Chan mans collection.  The best of the bunch is, well, all of the scenes can stand on their own.  Of course if the scene in the Nazi war room fighting a dozen mercenaries doesnt do it for you, nothing will. Jackie also shows off some cool gadgets along the way and this movie is regarded as the most expensive to make of all his films.
I highly recomend this film!",995328000,,474,4.130434782608695
905697,5,6304681518,"This was both the first Jackie Chan I saw, and owned for the VHS, and as such, this is one of my all time favorite Jackie Chan films.  It's a simple story about Chan and two very hot women (later on, a third one joins!) who are sent to Africa to find an old Nazi gold base and get the gold out before the European nations begin to quarrel over it.  What they are not told (but Chan finds out really quickly) is that there are a few other small factions of criminals after it also.
The movie opens with a great Indiana Jones parody, which is more than enough to get you used to Jackie Chan's character.  The other characters are either comic support, or stuntmen in which a few can act well enough to say a few lines before they get beaten up in some of Jackie's coolest action ever.
This movie quite possibly contains more action than any other Chan movie, as every scene is either a fight scene or a setup for one.  It is high charged, whitty and fast; hey, it was written, directed and co-produced by Jackie Chan himself!  Now with the DVD version, you can see more via widescreen, and the added detail really adds to both the picture and intensity, for there were badguys standing next to Jackie when he was beating up one of their mates that you can't see on the VHS version.  If you want cool, fast or funny action, get this movie; hell, it's all three!  Trust me, it's great.",983059200,,1381,4.248091603053435
905698,4,6304681518,"This is Jackie Chan's best movie.  Awesome fight scenes.  Most seem very realistic.  The usual awesome Jackie Chan stunt scenes.  This is Chan's version of James Bond.  Also one of Chan's funniest.  Any Chan fan will like it.
As a government agent, Chan is sent out with a female desert guide to search for the tons of lost gold in a buried WW2 Nazi base in North Africa.  Along the way, Chan picks up another female accomplice, the German granddaughter of a former base officer.
Several other governments are also aware of the gold, but don't know its location.  They either fight Chan or try to follow him to the gold.  Good, believable story.  Great scenery.",982022400,,661,4.620689655172414
905699,4,6304681518,"I still get a kick out of all of Chan's films, the comedy and action work perfectly.  One quibble here: could the U.S. distributors stop editing these things to include just the action and barely any story?  This routine is sloppy when done, and old.  And yes, this is the second film after the mysteriously titled ""Operation Condor 2.""

This film is also cheesier than usual, amazing fights but. NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL; armour of god.",974332800,,376,4.544117647058823
905702,2,6304681518,"Most people probably won't agree, but I found Operation COndor to be a bit lacking.  Yes, there is a lot of hand-to-hand combat to the film but it leaves a lot to be desired as the action sequences (with the exception of  the car chase and the last one) lack creativity and start to feel rather  repetitive after we watch Chan beat up the same guys over and over and over  again.  As to where First Strike featured the fabulous sequence that  involved Chan fighting with chairs, tables, sticks, a broom, and even a  ladder (a big one, too) and Who am I? had the great two against one martial  arts fight on top of a building Operation Condor basically has Chan  fighting a bunch of hired guns underneath the ground.  It surprisingly  lacks tension and excitement considering this is Jackie Chan we're talking  about.
Chan's attempts for Indiana Jones are a bit misplaced.  Yes, there  are some genuinely humorous moments, particularly in the beginning, but I  found the majority of the jokes to be flat and unfunny, something that's  usually not common with Jackie Chan films.
But the most damaging aspect  of the movie were Chan's three female companions, played by Carol Cheng,  Eva Cobo de Garcia, and Ikeda Shoko.  While Garcia was okay and mostly  unannoying in her role, Cheng and Shoko really know how to get on the  viewer's nerves.
Chan's later attempts after this proved to be better (in  my opinion) and he has since then made some of his best films.  Condor has  some punch but it never quite connects.",956188800,,1514,4.626415094339623
