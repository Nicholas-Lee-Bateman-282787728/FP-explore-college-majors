7544159,4,B018AXRM9U,"A movie that starts and ends at the same time...  I like what they tried to do here.

Do not expect a mind bending  movie that stands up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ink/dp/B00SRU0DIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ink</a>&nbsp;, but conceptually interesting.

Having said that, I think that the writing is a little weak to make this an actual 4 star movie.  The concept, however, is the reason that I am giving it 4 stars.  This is worth watching once.  The story line is a little confusing (it's supposed to be), but if this had been written a little better and possibly produced a little better, this could have been a great movie.  I have to agree with a previous review in saying that the acting suffered because of the scripting.  There is a point in the movie that slows down to a little bit of a crawl and I actually found myself dosing off..  (no i'm not an ""old"" man)

If you are open to many types of movies, this is worth watching.

There is not as much depth as I would have liked to this movie.  If you are pretty genre specific, or are looking for a deep psychological movie, this doesn't quite hit the mark.  Based on the title and movie cover, I expected a little more... Science Fiction.

Overall, I would have to say,  if you have some extra time, watch this movie as it has a different spin than similar movies.",1456185600,,1378,4.702928870292887
7544160,1,B018AXRM9U,"Unwatchable, I turned it off after 15 minutes.  The photo was the most intersting thing about this film.  Don't waste your time.",1456012800,,128,4.7727272727272725

7544176,5,B018AXRM9U,This movie was great. I love the concept and how they played around with it. I think the people who are giving this a low score either didn't realize it was a sci-fi film or didn't watch till the end. I will probably watch this movie again later on.,1465084800,,249,4.1020408163265305

8741920,4,B018AXRM9U,"This movie reminded me a little of Memento. Both movies do a great job of depicting memory loss and trauma. The lead character is made dependent on his father, yet he instinctively doesn't trust his father. He can feel that his father is withholding important information from him, essentially lying by omission. Without discussing the ending, I will say that it becomes clear that his father sees him as someone only he can ""fix"" and that as his father, he should be able to fix him as he sees fit, regardless of how his son feels about that. Not everything can be fixed, some things need to be accepted as imperfect.",1470787200,,618,4.576576576576577
8741921,1,B018AXRM9U,"I watched it because some people liked it and some people didn't.  I usually wind up liking those type of movies.
I really can't even give you a spoiler alert because the whole thing was confusing.  However, I will spoil what little plot there is so YOU don't waster your time like I did.

As you get to find out 45 minutes in (talk about a slow buildup!!!), the main character had a chip implanted in in head by his neurosurgeon dad after an accident and suicide to make his brain functional, but the life he lives is a lie as he lives in his old memories or some stupid stuff like that.  It's real confusing and his reality is mixed up.  In the end, he get his implant removed and BAM!;  end of movie.  it was like bad sex with nobody having an  orgasm and and it was all meaningless anyway.

I usually don't write spoilers, but I am saving you and hour and a half of your time.  You are welcome.  This pretty much is the worst movie I have watched all year.  If you watch this movie anyway, do not blame me if you read this review first when you agree it was awful.",1470355200,2,1068,4.106280193236715

8741923,4,B018AXRM9U,"Definitely ""out there"" and not a good film to watch if you are tired. (you have to pay attention). Confusing at times, and I hope that's intentional, it's only weakness is that the characters aren't likable enough to get to involved with. I liked the movie, and thought Justice Leak was really good in this. If I could have rated this between Okay and Like I'd have done that instead. But gave it the higher mark for effort. Good SciFi without really having to be science fiction.",1469232000,,480,4.528735632183908
8741924,5,B018AXRM9U,"Unexpectedly good for the mixed reviews.  Great acting for actors not normally seen.  Although at times this movie feels like a TV film, it overall delivers a big screen feel and the story combines thriller and Sci-Fi.  Loved the twist at the end.",1467676800,,247,4.6976744186046515

Keeping the audience off balance and confused is not a good enough excuse for a badly done movie, even if that idea, keeping the audience off balance and confused, is now fashionable in movies.  The sum total of the movie, a sense of pointlessness, not even fashionable cynicism, just pointlessness and a waste of time.",1466294400,,415,4.736111111111111
