8124477,3,B000FKPE5Q,"CENTRAL PARK DRIFTER
I've known for a long time that this film was cut for an R-rating. The title on this film is still GRAVEYARD SHIFT, which is displayed during the opening credits. I've always wanted to see it uncut and found a version on YOUTUBE that probably has all the missing gore. It's in Spanish and under the title CENTRAL PARK DRIVER that runs 86 minutes. This DVD runs about 89 minutes but is cut; the difference in time from that YOUTUBE version is probably because it's from a PAL source. I didn't compare the dialogue sequences between the 2 versions, but there's quite a bit of censoring with this R-rated version. This DVD is the same as my R-rated VHS with one exception. When those vampires surround and kill that guy towards the end, there's a brief shot of a vampire with the guys severed hand. I don't know why that isn't in my R-rated VHS; perhaps from an improper reel change or something. Anyway, this DVD is almost worthless to me because of all those assorted cuts that definitely damage the film. I really like the films soundtrack that's on YOUTUBE; it's worth listening to. If you want the film, I think it's best to buy it in this pack because it's nothing more than a censored version. At least it won't be a total waste of money because you've got the other 2 films.

 The color and contrast are fine, but it's soft and very dark. This needs a better picture.

TWO ORPHAN VAMPIRES
This is an overlong, talky, slow-moving and low on exploitation flick from Jean Rollin. There's a topless scene, as well as a part when you see some topless nudity from both of the vampires. One of them gets fully nude, but you can barley see anything because it's shown from a distance at night. The film displays some nice scenery, and some of the dark and dimly lit atmosphere is effective; however, it isn't comparable to some of Rollins earlier classics. There's very little blood in the film and absolutely nothing that's graphic. It's uncharacteristic of Rollin to make a tame film like this. The directing was fine, and both of the lead vampires did a competent job. It isn't a traditional vampire film. They can walk around during the day but are blind, but they regain vision at night. The main score during the credits is also pretty good. The film couldn't hold my interest. It just kind of goes from one sequence to the next, without anything really interesting happening and mostly boring dialogue. If you like slow drama and more sophisticated films that are mostly with a calm tone and talk, you might like it.

The quality overall is good, but it would've been better with improved picture quality because it would've made the atmosphere and scenery more enjoyable. Perhaps if I get the blu ray later on, I might like it more with another viewing. There's 2 interview extras, a photo gallery, and you get to listen to 20 tracks in a soundtrack extra. The English subtitles don't work on the DVD, so I had to watch the dubbed version.

FIANCEE OF DRACULA
With the exception of some slight bits of comedy with the nuns earlier on that doesn't belong in this type of film, this is a really good exploitation flick from Rollin. The story basically involves a woman who is traveling to meet Dracula with 2 vampire hunters in pursuit who are out to kill him and his evil forces. With gothic castles, stone buildings and assorted other effective scenery, this has a really nice look to it. The atmosphere with the darkness and dimly lit sequences are good also. There's a pretty good amount of nudity in the film (although some may want a little more because it's a Rollin film) with full nudity being shown. It's also much bloodier than TWO ORPHAN VAMPIRES. There's a really good gore scene involving a heart removal. Then that bloody woman rises from the dead and caries her bloody heart and throws it in the fire place; all that was cool. The only problem is that it gets slow in some parts towards the beginning with those nuns. Without those slow parts, it would've been a better film. It's also not an action-packed vampire film, so don't expect lots of fighting and stuff like that; if you're looking for one of those action type vampire movies, I wouldn't recommend it. This combined with those slow parts may be a problem with some.

The quality is very good, but I would like to see a blu ray with upgraded quality. There's an interview with Rollin. The subtitles work on this one.",1416960000,,4416,4.569444444444445

8124479,4,B000FKPE5Q,"Although this isn't a 'great' set, it is notable. Each movie gets a little better with production value and quality of storyline, starting with Two Orphan Vampires which is the least valuable movie in the collection. Although it is a horrible movie, I found myself minimally interested in how the story unfolded. The acting is a little bit better in Fiancee of Dracula, as well as production quality. Still, not a great movie but worth it for the price. But the real winner here is Central Park Drifter. It does have moments of slowness, but manages to somehow pull together a almost tangible storyline. With the highest production value and better actors/actresses in this feature, it makes the entire experience worth buying this box set of vampire movies. I recommend this collectio for completionists and horror enthusiasts only. If someone is just looking for high entertainment value only, they should invest in another horror triple feature such as the Bloody Schoolgirls Triple Feature.",1368921600,,994,5.104294478527607
8124480,4,B000FKPE5Q,"This review is from: Central Park Drifter: Graveyard Shift

This was a very popular movie rental under the title ""Graveyard Shift"" back in the 80's. The movie has a combination disco/ Miami Vice feel to it. The Travolta looking lead as well as the sound track gives it that classic 80's feel. Steven is a vampire in NYC who, like all vampires works the Graveyard Shift. Steven senses when women are in their ""death cycle"" at which time he makes them his lover and gives them a nibble. They in turn become vampires, who Steven never calls. He is a cab driver.

There is a subplot involving a woman named Michelle, who directs vampire videos, but apparently not to well. She is also terminal. Steven eventually ends up at a Halloween party at her house. Michelle's husband, who plays the field, is jealous, but Michelle is in love. The women vampires kill their victims. The cops are trying to figure out where the bodies are coming from.

The film uses red and blue lighting to represent heat and cold, hot and cold bodies. Sometimes it is effective, other times it doesn't work and is annoying. The movie also had some erotic nudity, especially one blue-lit scene with Kim Cayer, which was perhaps the main reason for its popularity. They don't even show her scene on the back cover and they should have plastered it on the front. It sold the movie. I think they did themselves a disfavor by re-releasing it under a different title, especially a bad one.

PARENTAL GUIDE: Sex and nudity. Not much blood for a vampire film.

This review is from: Fiancee of Dracula:

The movie starts out in a cemetery as a woman emerges at midnight, removes her robe as she bites the neck of a willing circus midget. The first thing I noticed was the directors good use of lighting, shadows, and color. Eric and his hypnotist colleague badger the midget to get information as to the whereabouts of Dracula (a word that pronounce the same in English and French). They eventually end up at a convent controlled by quirky nuns(Order of the White Virgins). Dracula's fiancee is located here. Only she knows how to get to the Master.

The nuns have lost some of their sanity because of their nearness to Isabella, Dracula's fiancee. This made what would normally be a dull scene, interesting. The hypnotist uses his whammy on the girl...and he can now read her thoughts as well. Eric and the hypnotist also communicate by mental telepathy. At times, Isabelle looked liked Michele Bachmann on the cover of Newsweek.

The movie makes use of symbols and colors, almost like Ingmar Bergman. I was curious as to what ""parallel creature"" would pop up next, something perhaps underutilized by the director. This film would make for a great Cohen Brothers adaptation, or a cultist Roger Corman production.

PARENTAL GUIDE:No f-bombs, no sex, full frontal nudity.

This review is from: Two Orphan Vampires:

Two teen girls are blind orphans by day. At night they regain their eye sight for hunting. They are apparently frequently killed and part of the film is flashbacks to previous lives, the first of which was extremely boring with no dialouge, just music. They are adopted by a rich elderly doctor.

The girls wear Catholic girl outfits, frolic in the graveyard, and even partake in dog's blood. In one scene they dare each other to stand naked outside their adopted father's window. They believe they were once ancient Aztec/Inca goddesses. The dialouge is culturally odd in the translation as the girls are described as ""so sweet, so pure, just like the sisters of baby Jesus."" Another bit was ""all gods are real because they are imaginary.""

The movie was artsy and not a real horror style vampire film. As an art film, I failed to grasp the message.

Lame sound track. PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, no sex, some nudity. Neither erotic or scarey.

These 3 films are for people who like oddball vampire movies with nudity. They are not by any means first run features.",1346976000,,3942,4.734306569343065
