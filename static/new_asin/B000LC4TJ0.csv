2701967,5,B000LC4TJ0,"Speaking from experience, opera buffs are the most passionate, opinionated, fanatical, divisive and stubborn people you'll ever meet. An opera production or a singer that some exult and will die for, others hate to the core! And that's good and exciting, hoping it will never stop. This experience is validated by the reviewers and commentaries made of Le Nozze di Figaro, the 2006 Salzubrg DVD of the Vienna State opera. Almost equally divided, some hated it and some love it. Out of nine reviewers, four gave it five stars and five one or two. For various reasons, both groups are right from their own perspective. I ordered this DVD on the stregth of Netrebko and D'Argangelo, two of the most electrifying opera superstars of today. Any regerets? After I played it, absolutely none!
Some purists were incensed with with Harnoncourt's slow tempo. So what's new? Two of the most-sought-after conductors of operatic and symphonic music- no names please- have been panned by critics for tampering with tempo- slow or fast. Some found the period staging of this production dull and monochromatic. Here it is how I see it:
Opera is a dying art. The average age of the Met Opera attendee is sixty or older. Opera productions have to become more relevant, even if it means that you have to get by without boudoir decors, brocade gowns and puffed-up wigs, so be it, as long a the music and the message are not compromised. Singers have to become less stilted and more annimated, interacting with each other. Mondernizing oprea productions- some call it Eurotrash- may be the only way to save the art and attract new opera lovers. The only problem is that in order to succed in modernizing opera staging, you need singers and actors of the highest caliber possible, for they're contantly exposed, and there's no place for them to hide. All singers, especially Netrebko (Suzanna), D'Argangelo (Figaro),Roschmann (La Contessa,)and Schafer (Cherubino) sang and acted superbly, taking this production to a higher level of theatricality, traditions amd musical interpretive syle notwithstanding. After all, opera was founded on theatrical principles inspired by Greek playwiters, dramatoutrgic and comic alike. Without hesitation, but regrtetfully so, I'll give this DVD five stars for six are not allowed!

2701968,5,B000LC4TJ0,"After reading some of the critical comments about this performance, I was prepared for really really slow music.  But those who hesitate buying the DVD because they fear Harnoncourt conducts in slow motion can relax.  It's a fine performance with a wonderful cast and a conductor who makes a strong case for a somewhat darker approach.  He is not treating it as a light comedy.  It's on the slow side, but nowhere near what you might guess after reading some reviews from people listening with a stopwatch in their hand.  And the slower (not slow!) pace has its merits.  You will hear things you have never heard before because they usually fall by the wayside.  If you don't like the director's concept or the conductor's approach, buy one of the other 50 Nozze-DVDs out there.  I am sure there is one for every taste by now...",1184284800,17,828,4.623287671232877
2701969,5,B000LC4TJ0,"Ignore unfair comments to this masterpiece. Listen to it twice and pay attention to the words, music and acting. It is Mozart's music with all its beauty where everything fits (words, singing, music, feelings). In Harnoncourt's Figaro all music is sublime.
Harnoncourt is the only person that can afford to take risks, playing the opera a bit slower is a great decision. This is perhaps shocking in the First act. But listen (or watch) the second and third act to appreciate Mozart's music at full extent and realize why Harnoncourt is one of the greatest conductors alive.",1183680000,11,573,4.917525773195877
2701970,5,B000LC4TJ0,"One cannot say that the majority of the reviews here are wrong, but that they--like this one--are merely opinions.  Interestingly, many of the reasons they give for not liking the production and conducting are the same reasons I would give for it being quite overwhelming.  As usual, when Harnoncourt reverses expections, it produces shcoked reactions.  This, surely, will gain the reputation as THE Figaro production that shows up the superficialities of most other producitions: the one that all the others will have to take into account.
Harnoncourt has always argued (rather than merely believed) that the tempi adopted in most productions of Figaro are usually taken too fast, especially taken in relation to the other two da Ponte operas.  Not only that, but that most productions ignore the specific relations of tempi within this particular opera and arbitrarily decide the tempo of each piece without taking into account the tempi of all the other pieces in the work.
Harnoncourt has also pointed that NONE of the da Ponte operas end happily; rather they open up chasms in the intertwined relationships between the characters that will hardly disappear after the curtain falls at the end.  Desparate (in the sense of despair) is his word for it.
This production takes these ideas to heart and provides the antidote to all those productions that think of Figaro as a proto-Rossini comic opera.
Translating these ideas into theatrical terms, Guth's production comes over, in fact, as visually very beautiful.  The characters are more like ghosts haunting this deserted oversized empty house, and who constantly play out the ""desparate"" relationship games that da Ponte and Mozart and Guth and Harnoncourt have designed for them.  They are frozen in time at the beginning, and at the end Cherubino, the Count's doppelganger who just wants to love but who is the catalyst for exposing the emotional chasms both within and between the charaters, falls down dead.
The music is directed with such intensity and, indeed, with a much greater variety of tempi than usual so that every moment counts.  As usual with Harnoncourt the lines are very cleanly articualted and he brings out elements of the orchestration largely ignored heretofore.  All five leads are among the best of contemporary singers, and deliver their performances--both musically and theatrically--accordingly.  And the Vienna Philharmonic is, of course, sans pareil.",1183507200,21,2435,5.236503856041131
2701971,2,B000LC4TJ0,"This production of ""Figaro"" has to rank as one of the most ungainly ever staged. Although it has a cast of distinguished singers, they are sabotaged by a conductor bent apparently on proving the old canard that Mozart's music has too many notes. Perhaps this is why he lingers unduly over each one, moving through the score at an elephantine pace. Similarly, the stage director has eliminated whatever in the text is light, bright and sparkling, matching the conductor in weighing down this sharp comical satire with an inappropriate dourness. I agree with earlier critics of this DVD, wishing only that I'd read their comments before I purchased it. Question: Are there any productions from M22 that seek to do other than be ugly and boring in novel ways?",1182643200,17,756,4.868217054263566
2701972,1,B000LC4TJ0,"Much appreciation to Susan Eisenberg, Toni Bernhart, and I.H. Gaulard all of whom are obviously knowledgeable and sophisticated opera buffs. Because I am addicted to Anna Netrebko, I bought the set anyway. Alas it was as disappointing as described in the three reviews: the sets were sparce and ugly - Act One looked like a great prison cell. The characters were so much in black: wrong color for a comedy. There was hardly a smile anywhere. Where in the world did they come up with the feathered, mute, cherub dancing around the screen? The whole effect was as sombre as a Mass.

Poor Countess! For her entry she is all in black; severe; plain as a shoe; and also without any sparkle or smile. No wonder the Count's eye was wandering - not that he was any maiden's dream: he looked totally dissolute, dull and boring.

Of course, this has little to do with the voices. D'Arcangelo, Netrebko and Roschmann sang beautifully. Skovhus sang passably but not memorably. But, so what? The orchestra was dull, slow, and often with loose ensemble (The Vienna Philharmonic, no less!)

Over the years, I have often been disappointed with Nicholas Harnoncourt - even in ""the old days"" when he concentrated on distorting the baroque. There have been a few good recordings, but this is a real ringer.

Even if you are a Netrebko enthusiast, this is pretty much a waste of your money.",1182297600,29,1370,4.7196652719665275
2701973,5,B000LC4TJ0,"Maybe because I'm a newer devotee of opera than others, but I found this Figaro to be interesting.  The singers are all wonderful.  I suppose if I had been used to another version, I might not like this one, but for those who love Ms. Netrebko, I think you'll like this as well.

Here is a sample of some of the critics reviews: This new, excitingly original production of Mozart's most popular opera was the sensation of the 2006 Salzburg festival.  ""What young director Claus Guth has made of Figaro - with Harnoncourt's active collaboration - is genius... The stellar cast performed with power and precision... This Figaro is as dangerous as the midday sun in one's eyes"" (Le Monde).  ""A triumph for Mozart... Netrebko's golden radiance and dark velvet are ideal"" (Salzburger Nachrichten). ""Shatterting, unforgettable"" (The Guardian).  Bloomberg echoed the positive accolades: ""This Marriage of Figaro should go down in history as departing director Peter Ruzicka's greatest Salzburg achievement . . . four hours of perfection.""

Here is one last review I came across: ""The acting is a lot subtler -- more filmlike, if you will -- in a 2006 Salzburg Festival staging of Mozart's ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" (Deutsche Grammophon 00440 073 4245), but director Claus Guth's angst-filled deconstruction packs a wallop just the same. Reimagined as a study of marital dysfunction, this ""Figaro"" evokes the deep well of sadness and ripple of forlorn comedy found in the best films of Ingmar Bergman (an influence Guth cites in a documentary on the DVD). Those who like Mozart for his surface froth will hate this production. Those seeking a revelatory evening of theater that taps the score's melancholy undercurrents -- shot by video-director Brian Large to communicate a palpable sense of live stage-performance -- will find themselves haunted by Guth's vision.

All the production elements are cut from the same cloth -- Christian Schmidt's peeling, hospital-white sets and elegantly straitjacketing 1920s costumes; Nikolaus Harnoncourt's probing, expansively paced conducting; and, not least, the casting of some dramatically compelling singers. If focus most consistently rests on Anna Netrebko's Susanna and Dorothea Roschmann's Countess, credit is due not only to their ravishing voices and canny acting but also to Guth's eye-opening decision to have both characters actually carrying on the sexual affairs they're accused of having. Bo Skovhus's Count, too, emerges as a fascinatingly conflicted character -- sheepish when not bullying, hormone-driven yet visibly nauseous over his infidelities. Nothing is taken for granted about these characters; all are conceived with a fresh eye and a sharp theatrical instinct.""",1182124800,20,2715,5.356807511737089
2701974,2,B000LC4TJ0,"This is one of several recently released DVD's from the 2006 Salzburg Festival at which all of Mozart's operas were performed. They've been dubbed the Salzburg M22's. Regrettably, I've yet to see one that I can recommend.

This production has so many fine performers in it. Unfortunately, you have to buy a bunch of other DVD's to hear those performers at their best: Anna Netrebko as Violetta in ""La Traviata"" and as Adina in ""L'Elisir D'Amore""; Ildebrando D'Arcangelo as Leporello in two different productions of ""Don Giovanni""; Dorothea Roschmann as Fiordiligi in ""Cosi Fan Tutte"" and as Pamina in ""The Magic Flute""; Christine Schafer as Gilda in ""Rigoletto."" I've gone to the trouble to list these other operas because these four performers deserve the recognition. They are as good in those productions as they are disappointing in this one.

Much of the fault lies with the tempo set by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. The extremely slow pace he insists on results in the comedic feel being sucked right out of the opera. Many of the scenes that make me laugh-out-loud in  ""Marriage of Figaro"" drag on interminably here. The slow tempo affects all of the comic performances.

For example, I know that Anna Netrebko can be playful onstage and even use her dark-toned voice to comic effect because I've see it in her portrayal of Adina in ""L'Elisir D'Amore."" But here, as Susanna, she's grim most of the time; there's no sparkle to her performance. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is a rich and expressive baritone (he's my favorite Leporello), but here, he's too heavy-handed as Figaro.

Christine Schafer seems miscast as Cherubino. The role sounds better when performed by a mezzo-soprano because otherwise there's no contrast in sound with the other two sopranos. Dorothea Roschmann, one of my favorite sopranos, is also disappointing as Rosina. She brings no decorum or nobility to the role (this may reflect the director's instructions to her). She's so ""common"" in demeanor that it's hard to believe she's a Countess. As a result, the opera's satire based on the different social classes of the Count/Countess and Figaro/Susanna is sorely lacking, even though it's an essential theme of Da Ponte's libretto.

Mozart's music is brilliant even when poorly executed (thus, two stars) but I like to watch ""Marriage of Figaro"" when my spirits need lifting or I just feel like having fun; next time, it won't be this production I reach for. For a great time at the opera with ""Marriage of Figaro,"" try these DVD's: Theatre du Chatelet 1993 (Gardiner conducting); Glyndebourne 1994 (Haitink conducting); Opera National de Lyon 1994 (Olmi conducting).",1181520000,35,2635,5.073903002309469
2701975,2,B000LC4TJ0,"As soon as the Wiener Philharmoniker play the first bars of the Overture, we know that we are going to be in for a looooong evening. Nikolaus Harnoncourt's tempi are extremely slow and will remain so for the next three hours and sixteen minutes (excluding credits and curtain calls). This is a good ten minutes more than his previous efforts in Zurich (on DVD) and in Amsterdam (on CD). It is about 15 minutes more than the average performance, 25 minutes more than Gardiner or Mackerras.
This in itself, would be nothing special if Harnoncourt was able to inhabit his tempi, to draw meanings to them. Unfortunately, he doesn't. The reason for this lies in the fact that the music does not really lend itself to ""contemplative"" visions. ""Le Nozze"" is first and foremost a comedy, the pace is supposed to be reasonably brisk on stage: Nozze is not Parsifal and the big risk of a slower, more dramatic approach means that the piece is deprived of its meaning: your turn a slice of life into a meaningless, inanimate musical object, beautiful at times but completely devoid of life. The big finales at the end of each Act (pick any: I, II, III or IV) will be the saddest example of this static musical direction. The music does not move, the musical material remains motionless, and ultimately one loses interest in front of such a stubborn view of ""Le Nozze di Figaro"".
By conducting ""Le Nozze"" this way, Harnoncourt lends a sympathetic hand to the production of Claus Guth. An extremely good, profound stage director, Guth is much more at ease with tragedy than comedy (Fliegende in Bayreuth, Zaide/Adama in this M22 collection). He therefore turns Nozze upside down and offers us a grim, petit bourgeois world that is unilaterally grey and evolving around a big staircase - Claus Guth LOVES staircases. In this Ibsenian, Bergmanian world, the Count is a pathetic middle-aged bourgeois cheating on his wife, the countess a cheated wife with no nobility whatsoever, and these three hours are just an isolated, one even feels almost a common routine in the uninteresting lives of these extremely unsympathetic characters.
One feels that the cast has been chosen with this musical/staging project in mind. It evolves around the dark-toned Susanna of Anna Netrebko, great sounding but Susanna is not Violetta: however, she fits perfectly Harnoncourts's and Guth's designs. Dorothea Roeschmann has a big voice, but there is no nobility in her Countess: listen to Te Kanawa or Fleming, and you'll know what I mean. Again, in light of her position in the ""concept"", it makes sense. The Count of Bo Skovhus is very tired. A pronounced vibrato has invaded the voice and his is simply not nice to hear, but this is again in line with the concept. Schaeffer was very successful even if she is not my cup of tea: I prefer a mezzo-soprano Cherubino. Selig barks, McLaughlin is a fun Marcellina. The only one who refuses to play Harnoncourt's game is Ildebrando d'Arcangelo. He is very often ahead of the orchestra but he has a beautiful voice and he tries to impose his conception of the character at all costs, despite the conductor and despite the staging.
Brian Large directs the video: the numerous close-ups on Miss Netrebko - even when she is not singing are extremely annoying after a while.
Let's face it: there are not a lot of good reasons to own this Figaro. I'll stick to Haitink/Fleming in Glyndebourne (NVC Arts). Deutsche Grammophon has two very good performances in its catalogue: a film by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle (Prey/Freni/ Boehm) and a very good performance by Gardiner and Terfel. Harnoncourt should always be commanded for his sense of experiment and his permanent willingness to take risks, but here the experiment blows in his (and our) face. Avoid.",1179014400,112,3757,4.862714508580344
2702009,4,B000LC4TJ0,"I was impressed by Anna Netrebko in La Traviata, so I purchased this because she was in it as Susanna...  Well, now I am very, very disappointed at her singing... maybe only for this Opera? Or maybe not...

While she was singing alone, she seems good... and she's very easy to look at too...

But in the duet in Act III, Sull'aria, Anna and Dorothea Rschmann sing together, and what a contrast! Dorothea completely overpowered  Anna, it was ridiculous! Anna can sing, no doubt, but she does not have nearly as beautiful voice as Dorothea... not even close! Anna's singing is more like that of a digital piano, vs. Dorothea more like a Steinway? Yes, it's about so called tonal complexity.... And her voice is not changed or anything in this particular duet... It was the same voice I heard in La Traviata.

Or maybe it's just me... she just don't have my type of voice I guess....

Anyway, all other male singer's aria isn't good at all as well, tempos are not necessarily all slow either, but they are just not good... I don't think I will watch and listen to this Blu Ray again, but this is a very clever staging, and something fresh too, so it was well worth watching once. Anna Netrebko is really beautiful here too, a very believable Susanna.",1375315200,2,1247,4.52
2702010,1,B000LC4TJ0,"I didn't even listen to the whole thing. I watched a few minutes, and listened to 30 seconds of the overture. And that's all you need. This is a nightmare Figaro from hell.

I understand the impulse to take the great artists of the world (Shakespeare, Mozart) and update to make them more relevant. I honestly do. And sometimes the impulse to update works. For example, I saw a production of Schiller's Mary Stuart with the fabulous Janet McTeer on Broadway, and all the men were in suits. It was perfect, highlighting the ruthless and businesslike nature of the men who surrounded these women and attempted to use them for their own ends. To put them in capes and ruffs would be to hide their manipulation in romanticism. It made Schiller's themes all the more clear.

But sometimes--particularly in a postmodern academic and artistic world--we take great works of art and ""make them in our own image, in our own likeness"" in a way that serves ourselves rather than the intentions of the artist. And this Figaro is such a one. It strikes me as revisionist for revisionist's sake--emperor's new clothes--trying to make Mozart into a man that has seen two World Wars and world wide epidemics. And--hate to break it to you Harnoncourt--Mozart was not a 21st century postmodernist. He simply was not, and to try and change his work so dramatically is to argue that his original vision (on surface level, opera buffa; but on a deep level, a profound commentary on marriage, money, and what makes people truly happy in the domestic sphere) doesn't matter. And I think his original vision did, does, and will matter.

Moreover--Netrebko as Susanna!?!??! Who the HELL made that decision? She's bad enough as Mimi (seen at the Met in the gargantuan Zefirelli) but her Susanna is atrocious. She's a sexpot and a diva, and, don't get me wrong, I love her for it, but neither of those is either MiMi or Susanna. The whole POINT of Figaro is to contrast the incoming 19th century beogeoisie but contented fidelity with the outgoing 18th century aristocratic flippancy and heartbreak. And Netrebko cannot do contended (but clever) 19th century style beogeoisie. She cannot. I adore her Violetta, and I think she would make a brilliant Tosca (though apparently she thinks she's too cool for that). But Susanna? Give me a woman like Elizabeth Bennet vocally: witty, clever, sharp, but at her core, modest, virtuous, and fiercely faithful to those she loves. Casting her was perhaps the biggest mistake in opera history.

If you care about Mozart's original vision of mischief and good-humor, with a subtle message on marriage and money, (once again, the analogy to Jane Austen seems appropriate), spend your money on the Solti recording with the London Phil. No one can beat Sameul Ramey (except perhaps Bryn Terfel, also seen at the Met). TeKanawa is......lovely TeKanawa; indescribably elegant and mournful. The energetic Lucia Popp sounds like her name: full of quickness, cleverness and vitality. And Fredica VonStade? Wonderful as Cherubino.

As far as DVD goes, I think the recent David McVicar production plays up the sexual tension in such a way that makes it accessible to modern viewers and non-opera goers, so I'd strongly recommend that one. Spend my Fourth of July (of all days!) ironing and watching it. That is an example of an successful update (though could we truly call it that? It's only to the 1830's, where the Count and Countess seems even more outdated in the century that loves the individual and the non-aristocratic). It succeeds in making Figaro slightly darker and less merry without plunging wholeheartedly into the abyss in the way that Harnoncourt does. Honestly--we have the Requiem, which is plenty dark. WHY do we need to darken Nozze di Figaro? Other than to pat ourselves on the back and congratulate ourselves for how fresh and modern we are? It smacks of arrogance, truly. Don't waste your time; don't soil your soul.",1363910400,7,3941,4.911411411411412
2702011,1,B000LC4TJ0,"My best advise is to watch a couple scenes on You Tube, before committing to buying this.  It is by far the worst opera production I have ever seen. The director must have a real disdain for Mozart, because he did everything is his power to minimize Mozart and Da Ponte's genious work. It's one thing to see a work in a different light, but this production was all the about the stage director's ideas.  Mozart's and Da Pointe's intentions were just in his way. Not even a great group of singers could turn this ugly stage direction into something of value.  The direction was ridiculous and many times laughable....the Countess writhing on the floor during ""Porgi Amor"",  Susanna and the Countess making out with Cheribino during the dressing aria, this Eros dancer on the Count's shoulders during ""Hai gia venta la causa"", Bartolo in a wheelchair and so soooooooooo much more.  This experience was nothing but a very bad memory.",1361059200,5,930,4.751552795031056
2702012,4,B000LC4TJ0,"Musically excellent especially the lead performers.  However, too many feathers in actual performance.  I have seen many productions of this opera without the feathers.  Also there is a extra customs' charge of 13.57 on top of the purchase price and this is not mentioned on the website.  The opera was, however, well worth the price I paid.

I really enjoyed the performance but could have done without the feathered addition.

Christine Harris",1346716800,,445,5.111111111111111
2702013,4,B000LC4TJ0,"As you may gather from the (currently) seven other reviews on this Amazon page, this is a rather idiosyncratic production of Mozart's first operatic masterpiece. Most have hit on the most noticeable aspects, namely  the sparse setting (usually all in white with stairs leading up or down), the extra character (the Puck-like ""Cherub,"" undoubtedly used as a fairy-like parallel to Cherubino), and the unusual tempo choices (usually much slower, giving the music a ponderous weight I don't think it's used to carrying). What it all adds up to is a Figaro played with a postmodern aesthetic and a quite serious sensibility. It's certainly not the comedy of errors interspersed with sweetness and longing we've come to know and love. Harnoncourt and co. seem to view the opera as being closer to the tragic profundity of Don Giovanni (or, God help all Mozarteans, Wagner) rather than the buffoonery of Serail (or Rossini's ""prequel"").

But it must be said that however controversial the production it doesn't take away from the talent of the performers, and this is a very talented Figaro cast. I've been somewhat skeptical of Anna Netrebko in the past, but in a cast that's solid from top to bottom, her Susanna is the undeniable star. Even without her good looks, her velvety voice manages to traverse the complexity of Susanna's character, from the playfully sexy and charming, to the more introverted and uncertain moments. Sometimes she manages both, such as the sublime ""Deh, vieni, non tardar."" That aria is taken at a slightly quicker tempo than usual, highlighting the contradictive forces in Susanna, namely both the desire and apprehension for the night to be over with. She's one of the few Susanna's that plays the character as ""knowingly"" as I think she was written, as opposed to just rendering her as the pretty-voiced, somewhat nave victim of the Count's advances. Or, to put it another way, Netrebko gives her brains as well as beauty (and a beautiful voice).

It could be argued that the rest of the cast doesn't excel quite to the level that Netrebko does, but I think what they do is a deliver a consistently strong ensemble performance. Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is an appropriately dashing Figaro, but perhaps slightly less charming in voice than in looks. If anything, he seems to play Figaro as more of an introvert than the usual gregariousness with which we're used to thinking of the character as possessing in spades. Although he has a vocal richness that's well suited to his pairings with Netrebko. Boje Skovhus is a rather raging count, bringing more of the darkness of the character out rather than the more usual buffoonery. I think his approach works better for the Count as opposed to D'Arcangelo's for Figaro. Christine Schafer is a sweet Cherubino, and the character whom I think most benefits from the modern production. Her ""Voi che sapete"" is treated with a rapturous sensuality, (not to mention the nigh-orgiastic ""Venite"" three-way between Susanna, Cherubino, and The Countess).

If there a slight weak spot in the cast it's Dorothea Roschmann. She's certainly not a bad Countess, but I simply don't think she can generate the pathos necessary to make ""Porgi, amor"" and ""Dove sono"" the transcendental pieces of musical drama that they are. If I had to argue why, the simple answer would be that she plays them too one-dimensionally and melodramatically--perhaps an irony since this is, literally, a ""musical drama,"" but Netrebko is a model of how to be both natural and ""musically dramatic"" simultaneously. Watch the exaggerated hand gestures in Dove sono, especially, to see what I mean. With all that said, she's still spot-on vocally, and she does get to shine more in the finale.

As for Harnoncourt's tempos and dynamics, I think anyone going into a Harnoncourt production with any knowledge of the maestro would expect some risk-taking. Right from the opening of the overture it's obvious that Harnoncourt is in a more meditative mood, as opposed to a lively one. Say what you will, I find this approach to Mozart fascinating enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, especially in an age where most conductors seem to agree that Mozart liked his tempos to be rather brisk, slowing them down gives us another perspective. I already mentioned the ""Venite"" three-way, and one can see the affect of this approach most vividly there, where it creates a much more luxurious, even licentious feeling to the music. It certainly helps that he's aided by the impeccable Wiener Philharmoniker, who do manage to play with a sense of dramatic urgency.

The production, much like Harnoncourt's tempi, is love it or hate it. I'll guess I'll be contrary and say I neither love nor hate. I guess I might say that the style doesn't innately appeal to me, yet it's different enough to keep me interested. While most have noted the sparseness, I think everyone has missed the abundance of details, like the fact that the stage floor is strewn with leaves, or the abundant feathers, or the stuffed birds in the windows. All of these elements gives one the sense of characters whose emotions are merely feathers/leaves in the wind, free to be blown about with little control over themselves. The birds are symbols of escape and flight, yet their ""stuck in the window"" lifeless, frozen positions seem to mirror how the characters are emotionally stuck. I'm surprised one reviewer thought that Susanna's lack of a ""hat"" in the opening scene was signs of cheapness in production when it was obviously a conscious artistic choices. By Susanna ""pretending"" to have a hat it highlights the fact that Figaro is off in his own world and ignoring his wife, something that's frustrating enough to Susanna that we begin to sense that maybe she would consider giving in to the Count's advances. It's one little touch that, in my opinion, adds to the conflicted depth of her character in this production that's absence in others.

The Cherub character is likely the most controversial aspect, and one can't help but get a sense he's somewhat of a knockoff of Shakespeare's mischievous Puck. But Uli Kirsch plays the character with enough physical talent and charm to sell me on the choice. He's paired visually, in terms of costume, with Cherubino, significantly highlighting the fact that it's Cherubino's own baffling, misunderstood, uncontrolled love and lust that's equally controlling the other ""mature"" characters. Thematically, it highlights the fact that these are all still adolescents in love. Personally, I think the more postmodern, ""metafictional"" touches (like characters freezing in mid-song, or moving like puppets, or whatever) is less successful than Cherub. It gives the feeling that the director, Claus Guth, wanted to go for something more knowingly artificial while Harnoncurt preferred the more naturalistic drama inherent in the opera. Although, I did appreciate the inverted staircase towards the end that reminded me of Escher's famous lithograph, as well as the movie Labyrinth.

So what does all of this add up to? I think it adds up to a solid production that's worth seeing if only for Netrebko's outstanding Susanna and the bold choices made in both the conducting and production. Obviously, these choices have not pleased everyone, but I would think for veterans of the opera whom have already seen dozens of ""traditional"" productions this might come as a breath of fresh air as it did to me. If nothing else, the video and audio quality of this blu-ray is superb, and should set a nice benchmark for other opera-on-blu-rays to live up to.",1330041600,8,7582,4.997624703087886
2702014,3,B000LC4TJ0,"Approaching this interpretation of one of the best operas ever written, with such a star-studded cast, one holds his breath in anticipation.  It has been a perennial favorite since its grandiose triumph in Prague in 1786, after nine performances in Vienna at its premiere; since those times Le Nozze remains part of the most popular repertoire.  There are many reasons for it.

It's been four years since Mozart's breaking off with his abusive hereditary employer archbishop Colloredo in Salzburg, a character resembling in his feudal attitudes Il Conte Almaviva.  Mozart's arrival in Vienna then in 1782  was marked by the composition of his first opera as a freelance composer - Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail, premiered in 1782 to a huge success.  By now, in 1786, Mozart was a well-established composer in Vienna, brimming with energy and creativity, very successful with instrumental works and concerts, but wishing again to astonish the public with a great opera made on a fashionable and somewhat scandalous subject regarding the conflict of aristocrasy and the others.  The French Revolution ideas are already circling over Paris, Vienna and progressive European capitals, the terrible uprising is only a few years away, but at the moment all the ruin, bloodshed and horrors are not foreseen, and the daring dangerous satire is extremely popular.  The Figaro  trilogy by Pierre-Augustin de Beaumarchais is now complete with the first two parts:  Le Barbier de Sville ou la Prcaution inutile (written in 1772, first performed in 1775) and Le mariage de Figaro, ou La folle journee (completed and first performed in 1784).  Both works were a great hit in Europe, and it was Mozart's idea to set the drama to music.  He handled the Beaumarchais play to Lorenzo da Ponte and the work on the libretto started.

It is quite amazing that Mozart and da Ponte had decided to use as a base the material banned by Emperor - Joseph II has forbidden the play in Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, an opera was allowed to be done and performed!  Why did he do it?  There are a few explanations, all of which are not very convincing - including the one that the Emperor wanted to teach the nobility the political lesson that a servant can assert his rights against his master.  However, it seems that such liberal policies that allowed the mockery of the existing regime were exactly the reasons for the collapse of monarchies, starting with the Fremch Revolution, in which Joseph II's sister met an atrocious end.  Why were liberal monarchs, patrons of the arts, so short-sighted?  The questions remains an enigma, but the good thing is that Emperor's patronage made it possible for us enjoy this opera.

Le Nozze had a predesessor - as mentioned, it is the second part of the Figaro trilogy; however the first part Le Barbier de Sville was set to music by by Giovanni Paisiello to an opera  Il barbiere di Siviglia, ovvero La precauzione inutile (The Barber of Seville, or The Useless Precaution).  The opera was premiered in 1782  at the Imperial Court, Saint Petersburg.  It is curious to note that the same libretto was reused by Gioacchino Rossini for his masterpiece, in 1816, with then old Paisiello, having lost his position as a privileged court composer, witnessing such an irritating development.  Paisiello was born before Mozart - in 1740, and died long after the French Revolution and Mozart - in 1816, and one can only imagine what he must have had to say about all he had seen in his eventful life, which encompassed epochs from Louis XV to Napoleon, with Catherine the Great in between.

Now, with a such a trail of an extremely rich history, what can be said of the performance in question?  Perhaps we can start with the good things - and to me, the conducting was an absolute perfection.  Nikolaus Harnoncourt followed the great tradition of Herbert von Karajan, and when listening to Karajan after this Harnoncourt, one can hear an unmistakable likeness in the approach:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-Nozze-di-Figaro/dp/B000TEPM5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Le Nozze di Figaro</a>

I love the tempi, the unhurried spirit, the phrasing and the pauses - Harnoncourt is very sensitive to give singers an opportunity to sing, and they do it so well until the overall stage direction interferes to ruin the great conducting.  But we still concentrate on the positives, so next plus will be again Harnoncourt's in-depth respect for the score - for example, both arias that are sometimes omitted in Act IV  (as they are in Karl Bohm's otherwise excellent interpretation&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-The-Marriage-of-Figaro/dp/B0007P0LNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro)</a>) are preserved - Marcellina's ""Il capro e la capretta"" and Basilio's ""In quegli anni in cui val poco"".  Regarding the latter, the story is even more interesting - a tenor sings this aria in this performance - Don Curzio/Oliver Ringelhahn; this must be a tribute to the first Basilio - an Irish tenor Michael Kelly, who sang both Basilio and Don Curzio at the premier in 1786.  Today Basilio is sung more by baritones, as is the case with this production, but the aria is preserved in its tenor appearance.

About the performers - surely Anna Netrebko is the main focus here; she is in a perfect form and is a delight to watch and listen.  Yet Susanna has only one aria, and the role when it comes to pure singing is not as rich as the Countess; Netrebko is a great Susanna but the overall dull production does not let her shine to her fullest.

Figaro (Ildebrando D'Arcangelo) is convincing in his singing, but again the ravages of the production dull his performance.  Hermann Prey had set a standard, with a cunning witty character, and a serious and slow-minded Figaro is not what can make an audience smile.

Bo Skovhus is a good Count, he sings expertly - I saw him in Arabella in Wiener Staatsoper in March 2011, he was singing Mandryka, a role requiring the same type of voice, and also of a country aristocrat.  He was very good, but here as there his manner is somewhat reserved; the oddities of this production affected his performance in a negative way; in any case, I wish to see a swaggering, proud Count - then he is amusing in his miseries; but this image is just a hopeless loser, which is not too entertaining.

Cherubino with Christine Shafer is marvelous, even if not too charming.  Her singing expiates for any flaws in appearance - that is, she is not a sweet and adorable young boy-doll with whom every lady wants to play.

Now, the not so good points:

The stage director found it necessary to introduce Ibsen and Strindberg into the libertine opera buffa.  What can possibly be a more lunatic idea?  The result is this giftless, wan and dull production, desperate to say something new and original, but coming out as dislocated and incongruent.  The most annoying Cupid truly ruins the great aria of the Count and the whole opera ""Vedr mentr'io sospiro"" by all the acrobatic routine of a pest. The music which is actually written in the style of opera seria, an expression of aristocratic grandeur and hauteur, inspired Beethoven for his ""Waldstein"" sonata, dedicated to the Count von Waldstein.  But here it did not play to what it amasses - the singer Bo Skovhus spent some of his energy on that petty fight with Cupid, so irrational in this particular place, too - as the idea of the aria is not really an amoroso one, but of a general power of a lord over his subjects.  This is probably the most glaring example of the bad, pretentious production, which was looking for clues in a wrong place - why did they not look in Mozart, da Ponte and Beaumarchais contemporaries???

The whole atmosphere of sensual innuendo, the naughty amusement, the funny mischief of the ambiguous libertine spirit of the time when the work was created and performed - all that is absent, mortified by Freud and Strindberg macabre shadows, and even the color palette of this spectacle is grey and blue, fleshless and withered.  It is an extremely serious opera, with no trace of goofy buffa, and it lacks the luster of a heartfelt comedy.

Countess Almaviva here is an unattractive woman, which also simplifies the idea of a licentious libertine who gets bored from a prey already captured, no matter how beautiful or ugly.  I think a beautiful Countess, like Kiri te Kanawa, would be much more convincing.  Besides, Dorothea Roschmann has too much vibrato, although overall her singing is very good.

The production put action accents in wrong places, too - the annoying adult awkward Cupid is all over in scenes where maximum attention needs to be called by the music itself, to the unbreakable concentration on the arias; but in a place where an action and a show is invited,  it was stunningly static!  During the famous March in Act III Finale - ""Ecco la marcia, andiamo"", there was no movement at all on stage!  What a bizarre solution again!  Perhaps it was deliberately made to annoy the spectator, in the great neurotic tradition of Freud and Strindberg.

Along the same lines of ugliness and modern preferences for the crude and repulsive, Marcellina and Bartolo made old wrecks, not funny at all, she sang very poorly, in a cracked voice, maybe on purpose but it was painful to listen; Bartolo is in the wheelchair, why?  His ""La Vendetta"" aria does not dance in such a mise-en-scene.

Costumes are simply boring, showing lack of that creativity and imagination that permeates Mozart's music.

Last October there was a similar ""Le Nozze"" in Teatro La Fenice in Venice, it went even further in the same direction as this one,  at times becoming truly outrageous, but it was much more entertaining, in a way.  Seeing my videos from it now, I think it was overall a more interesting interpretation than this one, lest for the extremism in some of its scenes, with spanking, hair pulling, whipping, raping and finally the Countess jumping out of the window, like Tosca.  At least it was less monotonous, and deserved a lot of hearty boo from the scandalized public, but it did generate some string reaction, while this production bores into the end.

Overall, this performance is worthwhile, mostly musically; it does not bring out the whole visual potential of such a great laugh and witty entertainment as ""Le Nozze"";  there is a caf ""Figaro"" in Mozarthaus in Vienna, but as this production, it does not do a true justice to the greatness of this opera.",1327449600,7,10623,4.944256756756757
2702015,2,B000LC4TJ0,"This production is unconventional, okay.
But it is not a 'successful' pioneer.
Rather, it is dark, gloomy, boring: lack-luster to be exact.
Music wise, the lead singers are all big-guns, but to a very large extent, they were either miscast, or not in their best form. In the former category the two ladies in the lead role and the 'boy' - Roeschumann as Rosina the Countess, Netrebko as Susanna the maid, and Schafer as Cherubino the boy page. In the latter category is Boje Skovhus, a seasoned Mozartian but singing in a lack-lustred manner here.
Production wise, not only were the attires boring; the entire dramatic action smacked stoicism despite the presence of an 'angel'. There were scarcely any real 'movements' that should flow naturally from the script. The characters are like wooden puppets, moving on a winding machine.
This is not the worst bit, though.
The saddest bit is the overall laboriousness that this performance and production brings onto the audience.
From the start, a dark-toned Susanna seals the entire atmosphere - this is NOT the chirpy witty wiry Susanna - she is some thing more schemy, more wilful and abusive (she slaps Figaro many times in the Fourth Act duet). The Countess is a street-sweeper in this production, faceless and graceless, despite the fact that she sings well.
D'Arcangelo's Figaro fared much better in the La Scala production in the same year os 2006.
If you want a REAL 'Le Nozze di Figaro' starring D'Arcangelo in the title role, go for that La Scala production which is 50 times better all round.",1323648000,4,1550,4.875
2702016,4,B000LC4TJ0,"If you like your Figaros in the tradition of sunny and funny--a kind of age of enlightenment sitcom--run don't walk away from this DVD. You will not like the way they messed with your beloved opera and will be inspired to write a review of outrage right here in this very spot. But if you don't mind being challenged, Harnoncourt's Figaro is definitely worth your while. My first reaction was: ""What the?!"" There's silent character not written by Da Ponte, Cherubim (Cupid perhaps?), who invisibly yet literally pulls, pushes and manipulates the characters through a feverish, hellacious day in thrall of love. I disliked him at the outset, but he proved to create an apt kind of symbolism for this opera. (It's a delightful moment when he encounters Don Basilio and literally bounces off of him. The man is love-proof.) After a while I entered into the spirit of this production and came to respect and admire it. I mean, when you think about it, Figaro has darkness at its heart. Sexual abuse. Betrayal. Duplicity. Class warfare. Child abduction. Absolutely nobody is happy, except momentarily. Even at the end of the opera, do you really believe the Count will stay true to the Countess? Pull the other one. (He's an oligarch, and oligarchs--as we know well these days--leave destruction in their wakes.) One aspect of this production that I can remember encountering only once before--in Otto Klemperer's unique EMI recording of the late 60s--is its powerful subtext of revolution. When Beaumarchais's play premiered, it was a thunder stroke. The servants smarter than the masters? No great European piece of art had ever dared say such a thing. Harnoncourt's rendition has that quality in spades, and I deeply admire it for that reason. The slow tempos are one of the things that give it that kind of social and human gravity. There are plenty of laugh lines, of course, but this is serious stuff. I certainly wouldn't want to be without lighter, more traditional Figaros. But--as with Shakespeare--there's plenty of room for contrary approaches. And no other Figaros that I'm aware of have been as contrary as this one. P.S. from 4-13-13: A friend very kindly gave me a copy of the DVD and I just want to note that if you're watching on a nice LCD or plasma screen (as I am), you may want to hold out for the Blu Ray. The DVD is not very well mastered, especially considering that the opera is spread over 2 disks. A well mastered DVD will look awfully close to the sharpness of a Blu Ray, upscaled on a Blu Ray machine; but this doesn't--there are jaggies, artifacts, and lack of sharpness.",1320710400,5,2597,4.773333333333333
2702017,5,B000LC4TJ0,"If one thinks comic book fans are a tad over-zealous in filmed approaches to their tight-wearing heroes, then a quick glance at reactions from many American opera fans, to contemporary opera, will reveal that those Marvel boys are a subdued lot. American opera fans tend to approach staged/filmed opera the way some fundamentalist Christians approach the good book, insisting on face value inerrancy and or the King James Version. So impassioned, or insistent on orthodox and/or period staging, are such American Opera fans that their first line of attack is to typically spew the over-used, tiresome, and oh so predictable ""EURO-TRASH"" slur. The idea, for those inclined, is to keep the composer locked in his or her own boxed time and, thus, shut the composer off to newer generations and fresh interpretations (Traditional Shakespeare fans are almost as bad). However, Mozart is still a vital voice in music, regardless of his worshippers. It is no accident that opera in Europe is far bigger, far more attended, and better supported than it is here in the states where the opera ""fans"" make a false religion out of the art form, slap an institutional sheen on it and transform breathing theater into a museum piece.

Over two hundred years after its debut, The Marriage of Figaro remains an extraordinarily three dimensional work, which does not flinch from portraying deeply flawed characters. Numerous filmed versions of the opera have been released, but the 2006 Salzburg entry may be the most uncompromising to date. There is, of course, Peter Sellars mid-nineties version which, aptly, takes place in Trump Tower, but the line-up of the 2006 film should be a yield sign to opera fundamentalists. The conductor, Nikolas Harnoncourt, has a well-earned reputation for ""weirdness."" In that, Harnoncourt,an Austrian by birth, possibly even surpasses that typically eccentric German music director Michael Gielen. Harnoncourt lead several of the M22 projects but Le nozze di Figaro is Harnoncourt at his most personal and insightful. Harnoncourt's is not porcelain conducting here; he mirrors the disconcerting underside of Da Ponte's libretto as interpreted by star director Claus Guth. Harnoncourt's seasoned pacing reinforces the nuanced poignancy, beauty, mature humor, and prospective, life-affirming drama of this music. Thankfully, Harnoncourt does not try to coat Mozart's writing with a kind of Rossini whipped topping.

Oddly,the romantics,more often than not,dismissed Mozart as one of those ""powdered wig composers"" and seemed oblivious to his remarkably progressive (and darker) hued works. While Figaro has comic elements, like Cosi Fan Tutti (the final and most complex of the Mozart/Da Ponte operas), it embraces every facet of human complexity. If one dispenses of pre-conceived notions and honestly approaches Da Ponte's libretto (which 'fans' are rarely disposed to do) then the context, rather than the period content, of the opera prevails. Guth, Harnoncourt, Christian Schmidt (whose stage design is exemplary),a uniformly excellent cast, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the production team do just that.

It is Susanna and Cherubino here who are the eyes of Figaro's storm. Anna Netrebko (a bonafide opera sex symbol,but hardly an artistic lightweight)as Susanna is objectified, but conflicted. She is pragmatically determined and,through sheer cunning, she attains her goal. The always interesting Christine Schafer is assurance personified as the shell-shocked, testosterone spitfire Cherubino.  Both women vividly resonate in their acting and singing. The men are nearly equal. Bo Skovhus paradoxically evokes repulsion and sympathy as the clammy Count Almaviva, who is consumed with fragile, Poe-like compulsion for the servant he truly seems to love, yet cannot fully attain.  Ildebrando D' Arcangelo's gallant, mercurial Figaro scorches suggested impotence, yet he never loses his admirable splendor.

Guth and company do not flinch from the libretto's displays of ruthless, erotic intrigue and the director employs poetic liberties: Susanna and the Count are already engaged in an affair. The Count has been secretly claiming his privilege with Susanna. Susanna is attracted to the Count, but she loves and is protective of the sensitive Figaro. She wants to put an end to the Count's sexual liberties with her, and her recourse to the cessation lies in the Countess. This Figaro is comic in a Bergmanesque manner: the humor is birthed from expansive contemplation.  Chrubino's angelic double (another poetic liberty) sets the motion, manipulating and advancing the unfolding, dizzying range of sweltering agendas, like chaotic lines in a diagram (at the end of the third act). These agendas reveal the inherent hunger of the characters. This is no vegetarian Figaro but its sets, hauntingly deprived of furniture, echo the decay of the aristocratic, cannibalistic mindset.

This probably should not be an introductory Figaro. Nor should the 2009 Netherlands Figaro, which features the resplendent Danielle de Niese as Susanna and is set, by directors Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito,inside a car showroom (it is actually not as ill-fitting, whacky as it sounds and really is winningly charming). If one needs to start off with a more traditional staging, then  there are two equally strong recommendations: Oliver Mille's 1994 version with Alison Hagley as Susanna (Hagley may be the quintessential Susanna on film) and Constanze Backes' memorable rendition of Barbarina's cavatina (an example of Mozart's ability to take a simple song, about a lost pin, and turn into sublime poetry). The more recent 2008 version by David McVicar and featuring Miah Persson as Susanna has almost become a universal favorite among traditionalists. However, Guth's Figaro restores the provocative sense of danger to Mozart's greatest opera. It is a memorable, shattering and potent alternative to an over-crowded field of staid productions.

2702018,5,B000LC4TJ0,"I don't understand what the bad reviews are about. Why the fuss about how this interpretation ""misses the boat"" on goals that the production clearly never had? And, not to judge a book by its cover, but if you want Rococo furnishings and all the ladies in hoop skirts or something, maybe don't go for the video with a nearly black-and-white photo on the cover...?

This Blu-ray, in many ways, brings out the best of what opera on Blu-ray can be. As everyone has said, he music and picture quality are dazzling. Also, the high-contrast costuming really makes the characters pop.

The bareness of the stage did a lot for me. It kept me completely engaged in the singing, which is all I want when I've got singers of this caliber. Netrebko's singing is such a delight, and it doesn't hurt that she's enough of a hottie that my boyfriend was willing to sit through the first act with me. I also loved the fact that the lack of stage clutter allowed the characters to sweep from one end of the stage to the other, with cameras chasing them the whole way. It really enhanced the dynamism of the music.

Like some other reviewers, I also appreciated the extra character. Yes, it's a little cheesy in that bordering-on-the-pretentious way, but who cares? Isn't the point of theater -- to have new interpretations? The attitude of ""same old, same old"" is precisely why people my age don't go to the opera! Which is precisely why people like me can't afford to go now that we don't get student rush tickets!

The only thing I wish were different is Figaro. WTF? (Why The Face?) It's like watching drunk karaoke amateurs trying to reach the top notes of a Journey song. Made me feel mildly constipated whenever I had to watch him. But small price to pay, since here's another great feature of Blu-ray -- I can skip through his bits when I don't want the bother. And it's a really minor bother anyways.

Overall, I think it's an excellent production with quality music and amusing staging. And aren't quality and amusement what Mozart does best?",1301270400,2,2033,4.589531680440771
2702049,2,B000LC4TJ0,"I bought this disc shortly after the purchase of my first Blu-ray player and, as a great Mozart lover, and particularly a lover of this very opera I looked forward to experience lot of high qualities, both in artists' performance and recording technology. Alas, after just first play of this disc I had known already, that only the latter one had basically fulfilled my expectations.

Although some kind of modern scenography - placing the action of the opera in far later times than the original scenery had been conceived by Da Ponte and Woferl, did not disturb me watching the performance, but I found the musical interpretation rather annoying. The one to blame is the director - Mr. Harnoncourt himself, I believe. I have to point strongly, that this is pure my personal opinion and many of the owners of this disc may disagree with me. I also do not try to diminish the fame of the said director, who is obviously better expert in music than myself, but in this particular case his way of performing this opera has nothing to do with its classical spirit and character. What I mean exactly, are specifically the tempos chosen for numerous arias. Even the fabulous Anna Netrebko was not able to change my general opinion.

But, if you don't worry about loosing some money spent of this BD, just try and find out for yourself.

2702050,1,B000LC4TJ0,"Upon coming across Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake people who have never seen a ballet may feel qualified to express the view that the experience was earth-shaking.  People who have never seen an opera and are confronted with this recording may also feel qualified to comment upon what Mozart and da Ponte had in mind when they put together the Marriage of Figaro.  To prevent such individuals from making complete fools out of themselves, here are a few explanations.

The Marriage of Figaro offers overwhelming evidence that, no matter what Aristotle says, a tragedy does not necessarily end in catharsis.  In other words, a tragedy does not necessarily lead to resolution.  The Marriage of Figaro is a tragedy. Susanna, the Countess, Figaro, the Count, Cherubino, Barbarina -- are all attractive and caught in the steel net of human emotions, urges and passions.  They thrash about trying to assuage the yearnings that choke them, and fail totally.  When the opera ends, absolutely nothing has been resolved.  We feel for them because we have all been there. But we feel doubly for them because they are more attractive than we are and it seems unfair that, perhaps, they hurt so much precisely because, unlike us, they are attractive.

I discovered the Marriage of Figaro fifty years ago, in Graduate School, when I realized I had locked myself in the wrong discipline.  It is no exaggeration to say that this opera kept me from committing suicide.  Since that time, I have collected every recording ever made and I have repeatedly gone to Milan, Vienna, New York and Salzburg to see what different artists were doing to this marvel.

This recording is a sacrilege.  Using tiresome variations of Scandinavian angst as a starting point, it has violated the exquisite taste of the composer and the urbane melancholy of the librettist.  It has introduced a deplorable creature with feathers to point at the obvious, and, in the name of modernity and innovation, it has made Susanna, Figaro, the Countess, the Count and Cherubino not attractive at all.  Over the years, I've listened to worse singing but nowhere have I witnessed a comparable determination to make a stupendous work of art look third-rate.

It is possible that someone for whom opera is terra incognita will see this travesty, think it's just great, and become curious about an art form that is far removed from disco music. Curiosity may then lead to a systematic exploration of what looks like an alien universe.  When some familiarity with the universe in question has been secured, the former ignoramus will feel deeply embarrassed that he rushed to give his vote of confidence to something he knew nothing about.

Hopefully, he won't do it again.",1295136000,8,2713,4.951434878587197

This is the very first instance in my whole life that I have gotten bored listening to any major work of Mozart. When a conductor tries to bring in Wagnerian 'isms (sic!) in to Mozart, you have this resultant. If there were negative stars (black holes) that could be given to a DVD, I would start with this one. Of all people, Harnoncourt.... never ever expected such a reading from him.

From the moment the orchestra starts the overture, you know you are in for a very different interpretation. I gave it a fair chance, and in fact saw this production twice just to make sure I was really bored the first time... I would call this tempo LUGUBRIOUS.

Singers are really terrific, but their voices are wasted on this rendition. Netrebko, although makes for a very pretty Susannah, I think is mis-cast in that role although she fits into Harnoncourt's plans quite well. The introduction of an angel who further distracts attention from the 'action' and music, spoils the production totally. Actually that fellow would have made a nice Cherubino if only he could sing.

All in all, a DVD worth avoiding.",1293840000,6,1110,4.682051282051282
2702052,5,B000LC4TJ0,"no, this is not your traditional commedia version of Nozze and those offended by the darkness of the performance have panned the Bergman/Strindberg approach, yet for the first three acts it works incredibly well: so, if you are prepared to explore the tremendous sense of distrust and unease between men and women that haunts all the Mozart/da Ponte operas (tensions that are too often fudged or glossed over in so many productions) then this is a performance you MUST see since for the most part this Nozze deserves far more than five stars, seven or eight at least, despite the seeming lack of the director's trust that his singers could bring home the last act cleanly and successfully without (unnecessary) arch over-staging

 with Netrebko (a simply magnificent Susanna), Roschmann (a fascinatingly deeper and more powerful Countess than her fine work under McVicar/Pappano released in 2008), Schafer (a glorious voiced awkward Cherubino), McLaughlin (a stunningly sung Marcellina) and Liebau (a beautifully voiced Barbarina) rivaling the excellently voiced men (including a much unfairly maligned Bo Skovhus as a Count whose aristocratic sense of guilty entitlement is excellently portrayed vocally despite the cumbersome over-use of his white handkerchief, and an excellent Basilio from Patrick Henckens)

and with sumptuous orchestral work throughout from Harnoncourt and the Wiener Philharmoniker beautifully recorded

and with excellent camera work from video director Brian Large

this is a performance very much for this age

however, the fourth act is problematical:  with the gender tensions and eroticism already deeply explored in the first three acts the notoriously difficult to stage fourth act can only offer more of the same - especially with the action supposedly taking place in the park still confined to the house:  moreover, and unfortunately, the directorial conceit of the added Cherub becomes here a downright nuisance drawing attention away from the characters the singers have superbly created by their acting as well as their magnificent voices, as does the totally unnecessary 'show and tell' staging of the temptations for men and women which interfere with the excellently sung fourth act arias from Marcellina and Basilio

despite this qualification this Nozze will take pride of place in my collection, even though I might be tempted to only listen to most of the fourth act instead of watching (thank goodness for the lack of interference with  Babarina's opening Cavatina and Susanna/Netrebko's beautifully sung 'Giunse alfin il momento')",1281052800,3,2577,5.43609022556391
2702053,4,B000LC4TJ0,"Be honest with you, I didn't like the tempi of the overture. It surprised me that was from Harnoncourt. Because he was the forerunner of Mozart and other Baroque music for me. I have listened almost all his recordings on symphonies, he is the one who 'think-again' rather than just 'follow' the conventional taste.

And later, I listened the overture again while I was watching this Figaro DVD (I never watched this opera before). You know, this time, I didn't bothered by the tempi of the overture anymore. I think it's fine. Even it's a lot slower than most of the version, the phrasing and the imagination are still there. Nothing really missed. The Wiener Philharmoniker is great of course. (I actually hear clearly the sound of the concertmaster, has anyone noticed that? he plays way louder than others)

Since this is my first time to watch Figaro, I didn't had it's 'comedy' deep in mind. So, after I watched this production, I felt it is more like 'drama' than 'comedy'. This has been stated by other reviewers.

I am not a huge fan of Anna (Susanna), I just think her voice is not as 'concentrated' as others (only for my taste). Maybe her voice could be better for Romantic operas. I will find out later though. But, her acting is not bad. And her dress in this Susanna is very elegant for me and I like her shoes (good choice) :)

The 'invention' of the angel boy in this production is a genius idea. The stage sets are not changing much as usual probably because of the place. House of Mozart is relatively small.

I think I am going to watch another version of Figaro later to see the different.

Make sure you watch the bonus on the second DVD. It explains why Harnoncourt think the story of Figaro maybe can express in an altered direction.

2702055,5,B000LC4TJ0,"I entirely agree with M Van Loon.  This is a marvellous performance with superb singing from all the artists.  While it is probably unfair to single out any one performer I have to give specific praise to Netrebko, Schafer and Roschmann.  Simply gorgeous voices and all of these artists have such good acting ability that it brings a new dimension to opera.  Over the years having seen many Figaros I have to say that this one is in a league of its own.  As to the previous comment which critised the sparseness of the set, I would have to question the rationale of going to the opera. Is it to hear glorious music well sung and acted or is it to see beautiful costumes and colourful sets?  To my mind the minimalist staging concentrates the mind on the singing and the performance of the artists.  If I want to see authentic costumes I can always go to a museum!

It also has to be said that the quality of the Blu-ray is top notch.  Wonderful clarity and detail with stunning sound.  Nothing to dislike.

On a personal level I enjoyed the introduction of the Cherub acting as a sort of unauthodox 'guardian angel'. This is a graceful performance which added to my overall enjoyment of the performance.  I suppose that strict purists can always take issue with any deviation from the norm.  However, I like to regard opera as a continually developing art form.  New interpretations can often bring new life into familiar territory without diminishing the appeal of the original.

This disc also has very interesting interviews with the artists and selective excerpts from rehearsal.  The disc is excellent value for money, being cheaper than many standard definition opera dvds.",1256601600,5,1679,4.718213058419244
2702056,5,B000LC4TJ0,"I find this a superb recording of a beautiful opera. The decor is modern and sparse, focusing on your eyes on the excellent acting. This performance is so packed with emotion that I don't see what furniture would add to the experience.

As for the singing, I can't find fault with any of the performers. It's hard to point out a highlight since I really enjoy every second.

I think the extra character is a succesful experiment. His appearance drives home the morale of the opera (in my view) that even if the characters think they are in control of events, they're really being driven by forces out of their realm. His expulsion (by the original characters) at the finale is comforting to us who believe in free will.

If you feel operas are static performances that should be played in their original decor, by all means skip this rendition (or merely buy it for the sharp audio). If you enjoy a good experiment, I'm sure you'll enjoy this edition!",1254182400,9,951,4.58235294117647
2702057,2,B000LC4TJ0,"Seldom has such stellar talent taken such glorious source material and produced such unconvincing results. As an admirer of Netrebko, Schafer, Harnoncourt and ""concept"" productions in general, I looked forward to this DVD with much anticipation, and I find it hard to overstate my disappointment. Productions that add new insights by taking calculated risks are to be welcomed, but this one is too clever by half, misses the point and ends up compromising one of the greatest operas.

The main culprits are Harnoncourt and Guth, who have decided to turn this edgy and brilliant comedy into a dreary and often pretentious bore.

The set is a depressing over-scaled turn-of-the century interior gone to seed. Dead crows, feathers, leaves and other detritus litter the stage. This sets the tone, as the opera's extraordinary subtlety, inference, pace and wit are overshadowed by heavy-handed symbolism, occasional nastiness, and depressing, ponderous tempos. An unscripted teenager dressed as a cherub flounces on stage every now and then to remind us that the protagonists' love-interests are complex and intertwined, on one occasion providing us with a PowerPoint presentation in case we are too dim to get the point. Every time this ludicrous figure enters, the protagonists go into slow motion, which would be merely silly if the entire production wasn't already in slow motion, Harnoncourt having decided to linger over every phrase, in the process losing most of the sparkle and tension in the score.

Guth takes an outstanding cast and wastes them. Christine Schafer would have been wonderful as Cherubino had she not been forced into agonizingly slow tempi and ridiculous situations. In one memorable moment, when Cherubino says to the Countess "". . . perhaps these lips would dare . . ."" she does so after both the Countess and Susanna have been sucking Cherubino's lips off his (her) face. And then the unscripted cherub drifts in, symbolically dispensing feathers over the protagonists.

As for the rest, Ildebrando D'Arcangelo is a dour Figaro, Bo Skovhus a nasty Count, Patrick Henckens a bizarre Basilio in a wheelchair (on one offensive occasion, falling out of it). Dorothea Roschmann a pathetic Countess. Anna Netrebko tries her best as Susanna, but not even she can inject enough levity to redeem this humourless and pretentious show.

2702105,1,B000LC4TJ0,"I had great hopes when I bought this disc but they were soon dispelled when I started to watch. I already have several DVD versions of this masterpiece in my collection - for me the best one by far was directed by Jean Pierre Ponnelle in a film studio, back in early 1980s. This blue-ray production borders on being an artistic travesty. It is so bad that I have given it only a one-star rating, the lowest I have ever given an opera on either DVD or Blue-ray. This disc's only redeeming quality is that it is technically  excellent - the video direction is exemplary and the DTS-HD 5.1 soundtrack  outstanding.
Unfortunately, the stage direction and overall presentation are among the worst I have ever seen. It is puzzling that a conductor with the experience and knowledge of Nikolaus Harnoncourt would ever agree to be associated with it. The staging is an unmitigated disaster as are the custumes. The addition of a cherub is both distracting and ridiculous - the stage director (Claus Guth) would have been very wise to present the work the way Mozart wrote it. If this is the best Mr. Guth can do then I think he ought to seriously consider an early retirement and not inflict his bizarre intrepretation of great operas on an unsuspecting public. Quite honestly, the custumes were far too austere and bordered on the absurb. The less written about the monochromatic sets and complete absence of elegant furniture the better.",1237507200,20,1431,4.742971887550201
2702106,5,B000LC4TJ0,"Sometimes before writing a review, I take a few moments to read the criticism of others. By doing this I can often gain some insight into the greater perspective, whether the thoughts and ideas of other reviewers are objective or subjective I can in some way further understand the impact a particular work of art has had on others.

For me, I was immersed in this production of Figaro. But I understood why. If Ingmar Bergman had attempted to direct 'Figaro' late in his life, this is the opera I would have envisioned. Also, I am fairly new to opera and thus, so far, a novice in terms of appreciating the nuances which others more critically aware can pick up on. From my newbie eyes and ears, I enjoyed everything and I was entranced by the music, the story and the layering of moral questions which occur in this piece.

Forewarned is forearmed and I'm sure I would have seen this production despite the reviews. There is an element of 'dramedy' to this interpretation. I found the clothing to be particularly Franco-Fascist in design - Seville of the 1930's. And the director's take on relationships is equally dark (not to mention 'stark') but not without its depth and humanity. Infidelity is an eternal aspects of the human condition. The pursuit of sex outside marriage and relationships is a common theme in literature and I think to take this work as both an examination of these ideas with Mozart's music is not outlandish.

There is a tender sadness to this piece. The stage had a bourgeois-austerity to it, emphasizing the entrapment of these characters. The ending proved both thrilling and solemn, the lighting suggesting these characters are lost within themselves, not to mention their desires which further their weakness. Being a reader of Schopenhauer, I can appreciate these subtle touches. In the philosopher's take on life, human beings are essentially self-concerned by their will, totally immersed in pleasing themselves. In this 'Figaro' everyone is out for themselves and any form of kindness shown by these characters is tinged with self-gratification (as we witness in the scene with Cherubino being 'assisted' by Susanna).

If this all appeals to you, I highly recommend this production. It is perhaps the Pessimist-thinking man's take on Mozart.",1236384000,3,2278,4.971128608923885

And talk about sparse; Susanna sings her opening aria about her hat without wearing or holding one!  Most of action takes place on a bare set with no furniture.  This is a travesty and a disappointment.  I was so hoping for a new production with wide screen, superb sound and top performers but this is not it.",1230768000,34,634,5.048076923076923

It became about picking up papers and how he would get back in the chair! The ""non piu andrai"" was the worst travesty. I'm sorry the Salzburg audience had to be subjected to this at those prices.

2702111,5,B000LC4TJ0,"This is an intense and unblinking look at human relationships and the social frames in which they are set. It is about our desperate determination to fit into such frames and to uphold them, against our deepest yearnings to transcend them. There are lovelier and funnier versions of Figaro, but I doubt that there is a more gripping exploration of the interplay between the social and the personal, public and private.

The production takes many risks, but it is so daring in conception and so creative in execution that all gambles pay off. The staging is one of complex visual allusions and minutely devised choreography. While not bathed in rococo pink, it is never bleak or monochromatic. The characters dangle in hope and fear, longing to connect and not having the courage to do so. Love is imagined, craved for, groped for, and then suppressed, deemed impractical, pushed aside. Repressive power does not simply emanate from the Count. It is internalized in everyone--albeit to varying degrees. Harnoncourt's tempos allow the opera's emotional intensity to fully unfold and passages of haunting beauty to emerge afresh. A number of scenes have a dream-like quality; they put you into a trance and allow you to truly hear the shades of feeling in the music. It could be called a modernist production, but none of it is there just to be different. It is there to visualize the relationships expressed in the music. It illuminates angles that I had never seen, heard, or imagined before. The comparison to an Ingmar Bergman film is apt in terms of the emotional and erotic charge, the superb use of light and shadow, even the camera-work. The shots from high above the stage, toward the folly, desolation, and--yes--hope below are magnificent. For despite all the loneliness and brutality and despair, there is hope. `Voi che sapete' is the most heavenly I have ever seen. Yes, seen, as this is a performance that you really have to see, not just hear.

This is a version for adults. Dim the lights and let yourself be moved. Our ability to overcome pre-given frames is at the heart of Figaro.",1218240000,6,2097,4.854748603351955
2702112,5,B000LC4TJ0,"This is not your grandma's Figaro. At first I was surprised, then taken aback, then intrigued and then completely mesmerized. It's Figaro meets Psycho. The pacing is slower, more deliberate and the whole tone and atmosphere darker and more intense. And in the end, I think it works. The whole theme of this production is the maddening power of Eros (here portrayed by an extraneous character- a seductive non -speaking/singing young man dressed in school boy uniform with cherubic wings running around trying to manipulate all the characters) locked in a battle with ""Love."" In the end ""Love"" triumphs. (except for poor Cherubino who throughout the opera is portrayed as a poor young thing totally defenseless against the power of Eros--in the end he's reduced to a zombie). The singing and the technical quality I thought were first rate (It's a very recent production so it utilizes the latest in live sound recording..not like some of the older productions where the sound drifts when the singer moves in and out of microphone range).I think if you are not familiar with the more standard productions of Figaro, you'll have a hard time with this production, both in following the plot and understanding all the new meanings and interpretations that are being created. But if you already have seen a number of standard productions, I'd thing you may enjoy this, if not just for its strangeness. I doubt this production will ever replace the more standard production, but it sure made for an unexpected and interesting evening of opera.",1215648000,50,1537,4.98443579766537

2702114,5,B000LC4TJ0,"If you are really patient, read my whole article cause I've worked hard on it, however, if you need fast answer to decide whether to buy or not this DVD, just read a few more lines.

If you are ready for a new Figaro (this doesn't mean you are gonna replace your old Figaro versions), buy it.
If you like good graphics and good sound. Buy it.
If you are looking for a good orchestra with a huge conductor and good (not best) singers, buy this.
If you are looking for something new in Mozart's Opera, without changing the libretto, just with a new reading of it, buy it.
If this is the first time that you are coming to ""Le nozze di Fgaro"", don't buy it.
If you are not ready to see your Figaro slow and sad. Don't buy this DVD.

I got myself crying at the end of this ""Le nozze di Fgaro"", when Rosina sang ""Pi docile, Io sono, I dico di s"" and my ears could not believe in that slow and strong march at the end.
Actually, I must admit that my favorite Fgaro will always be the ""comedia"", but this ""tragedia"" was very well done.
Harnocourt's task here was to turn a very soft and funny opera into a very complex human being's relationship. He did it very well.

Before listening to this Opera, I could never have imagined a ""Figaro"" in a Drama, but this opened my eyes and I wait anxiously for new versions of it.
This, rather than ruinning Mozart's music shows that it is so sublime that with a bit of slowness and pushing it (without blinding the singers) a little you can, with a lot of wit, change the spirit of the thing.
By using dark and big scenarios, the director brought a sadness to the house. This , I think, fits very well the idea of transposing the opera from the 18th to 20th century.

All is right here, in the 18th century, the treason was something more common and funny. In the 20th it had changed. To betray your husband/wife was something really ashaming. You can see that Susanna (in this version) really betrays Figaro with the count and that she is divided. Ana Netrebko says, in the making off that a person can love two people and this, I think, is true.
You can see here an anger ""Contessa"" and a very violent ""Conte"". The only carachter for me that looses its strength is Figaro. Here he looks like a man, commanded by the 2 women and this is a bit concerning, couse the name of the Opera is The marriage of Figaro, thus, he should be strong and I didn't like this submission.
Well, with all this, I just wanna express that I enjoyed this production, though it is not the usual way this opera is done.

The good points for me are: The strings in the orchestra. They are really impressive and you can notice it in the 4th act arias, where they are demand to be great. The winds are not in the same level, but are ok;
The inclusion of the Marcelina's Aria, which is sometimes cut off from the opera, but in this case, is very important for the plot, cause explains what women are feeling there.
Harnocourt know how to conduct one good orchestra and he does it very well here. Some reviewers said he is too slow here, but this is part of the make up.
The Finale in the fourth act is great and combines with the DARK air in the whole Opera.

Scenario and Filming are amazing. The ""Cupid"" is also a very enjoyable additional.

On the other hand, there are bad things: The choreography is ugly. If they tried a realistic Opera, why to use these ugly dances?
In the wedding I got disappointed, the scene does not work. The women's choir is terrible. They turned a beautiful girls' crew into a German female army.
Don Bartolo is not well played here. The first scene of him, in a wheelchair causes anguish.
I didn't like d'Arcangelo like Figaro. You cannot notice him in the stage. His voice, on the other hand, is nice and his Italian is perfect (off course) .

I hope to have helped and I rated it 5 stars cause it is in most, really beautiful and new. Nevertheless, I would never change my ""pera Buffa"" Figaro by this one.",1212364800,36,3945,4.264705882352941

The introduction of the cherub distracts from the music, the camera, and viewer, spent more time watching that ridiculous character than attending to the music.

Let's not forget the dead crows tossed out the window.  And what's with Harnoncourt himself?  The orchestra members are dressed to the nines in tuxedos and he's wearing a black shirt.

2702131,1,B000LC4TJ0,"I have collected so many different recordings of this most wonderful opera. It is so full of fun and life to make me feel so good. Some of my favorite recordings are conducted by Bohm (I have four with him and all are wonderful), Walter, Giulini and Rosbaud. Bohm had a tendency to be a little slow but that didn't matter much because everything made sense and was in harmony, and was so much fun in addition.
I had heard a couple of excerpts of this recording, which is also available on CD, and I knew it was slow but I had no idea until after I bought it just how slowly it was conducted. The slow tempi were so annoying and many times, especially in the recitatives, everything stopped. The harmony of the music were so many times simply destroyed by Harnoncourt because of the his changes from really slow tempo to even slower and to yet even slower tempo. The whole opera became almost depressing to listen to because of the extreme seriousness that was created because of the tempi. The playful and wonderfully melodic music of Mozart was gone! Bohm could be slow but you could feel that his tempi made sense and the fun of the piece was not sacrificed because of this.
Even though I have listened to the opera so many times the forth act finale always gets me. The fun when Figaro pretends that Susanna is the Countessa when he is making love to her in front the Count and seeing his reaction, and the wonderfully tender and forgiving music when the Count asks the Countess for forgiveness. All of this is simply not there in this recording by Harnoncourt. I personally feel that a good recording of Le Nozze di Figaro should be both funny and elegant. This one is neither.
Another fact that irritated me was that a harpsichord was used instead of a fortepiano (or a piano) in the recitatives in addition to that the recitatives were seldom accompanied by the harpsichord. It was just there to punctuate the sentences.

On to the solists. Anna Netrebko and Ildebrando d'Arcangelo, as Susanna and Figaro, were really excellent. The two of them were so good together to almost merit buying this DVD, almost. Bo Skovhus, as the Count, was not good at all. He really struggled all the time to keep a good tone. He was really wobbly. Dorothea Roschmann, as the Countess, sang well but dramatically she was even worse than Skovhus. She was definitely not a noble woman in her singing. She sounded much too common for a Countess. Christine Schafer, as Cherobino, was ok but nothing more.

Last but not least were the really horrible staging. Everything was staged around a giant staircase. The color palette that was used just added to the depressing view of the whole opera. This goes for the costumes as well. THE most annoying thing about the whole production was the addition of the cherub who just danced around and interacted with the solists without interacted with the characters. When d'Arcangelo was singing his first aria in act 1 the cherub was blindfolding him. When Skovhus sang his act 3 aria the cherub was sitting on one of Skovhus' shoulders which added even more stress on his voice because he had to carry the actor in addition to holding his balance and singing at the same time.

The addition of the cherub was just an annoyance and just made me like the whole performance was bad along with the really bad and inconsistent conducting. I realize that Harnoncourt has another view of the opera and score than what is generally performed, but this is well beyond just another view. When all the charm, fun, harmony and elegance of the whole piece is gone because of this view I would say that he should stay away from this opera. And when he says that everyone before him has conducted the opera wrongly I just say ""What arrogance!!!"".",1185667200,30,3756,4.586309523809524

In this latest example of the (Euro)trashing of the classic repertory, Strindberg meets Mozart in what can only be described as the stuff of opera parody.  By the time that poor Ildebrando d'Arcangelo has to carry the dead black bird across the stage in slow, stylistic Robert Wilson-esque movement, I didn't know whether to howl with laughter or rage.  What a waste of an extraordinary cast, each of whom looks palpably uncomfortable as he or she tries in vain to make sense of directorial misteps that really have to be seen to be believed.  (Or not.)  And to compound the stunning idiocies of the staging (including a cavorting winged figure representing -- oh, God knows whom), Harnoncourt's turgid tempi completely suck the air out of this most glorious of scores.

As a result, some of the old cliches are done away with.  I was especially amazed at Bo Skovhus' Count who is not a one-dimensional tyrant with entitlement issues.  His Almaviva is so much more complex and interesting to watch.  The same is true of all the singers down to a really sexy young looking Antonio who really SINGS the music.  When was the last time we heard Antonio's music SUNG and not barked?

Despite all this, the director's concept is not always inspired by the music.  The color scheme of the production is monochromatic.  The addition of a mute cherub to clarify the subtext of the characters is gratuitous and annoying.

8160929,5,B000LC4TJ0,"I think this is the best opera performance I have ever seen ... Superb acting (in all details) and singing, and the performance just vibrates with the tensions created by erotic desire, jealousy, fear, righteous anger and many other emotions. Some viewers are not so fond of Bo Skovhus, but I think he is a perfect count, horny and dangerous. So beautiful. I am profoundly grateful to Mozart, Harnoncourt, the singers and the musicians for the pleasure I have in seeing and hearing this opera again and again ....

P.S. Edit: I forgot to give thanks to Da Ponte and Claus Guth as well.",1413590400,2,585,4.625
8160930,5,B000LC4TJ0,"controversy surrounding this work almost a decade on is hilarious...goes to show there is something here.  Freud's critics often site that his theories were so bad that they couldn't even be wrong, and for a proper piece of art, there should be haters...otherwise, it has not done its job.  A lot of people will hate the idea that something as asinine as Eros could be controlling the overall mind...nobody wants to believe one is not in charge of his or her mind, but from Cosi fan tutte, and the overall tone of his works, I'd think Mozart himself will agree with this staging.  The other cool thing about the staging is that it is in black and white...the music and the body language frees the mind of everyone...and that is why there are opinions all over the board...everyone feels compelled to comment on it, just like the Taj Mahal or something brutally symmetric like a Mozart opera...don't ever believe that Mozart wanted u to feel good..he wanted to communicate something, and this obviously did it...as to the comments on Harnoncourt, The only people entitled to criticize him are the ones that have devoted decades of their lives to Mozart, otherwise, watch the opera again",1401321600,2,1185,4.799019607843137
8160931,2,B000LC4TJ0,"At the risk of being labeled a retrograde, I would like to use this example of how not to stage opera.  The production had everything at its disposal - a host of talented singers, a first-rate orchestra, and this amazing new technology that allows the sound to be cleanly captured no matter where the singers turn or where they are on a stage.  Yet almost everything went wrong.  I imagine Claus Guth is a highly skilled director of... okay, maybe Broadway-type shows (I almost said ""burlesque"", that's probably where his true talents are), but he is clue-less in opera.  First of all, he moved the action to early 20th century, and all the flirtatious and easy-going romp of Beaumarchais, on whose 1778 play Mozart's opera is based, became unimaginable.  To correct for that he added some wildly sexual behaviors to the major characters without the slightest regard for the actual story.  E.g., Susanna apparently cheats on Figaro with the Count, making the whole point of her and Figaro's game unnecessary.  The Countess at one point together with Susanna forms a mnage-a-trois with Cherubino...  A cupid-like mute character was written in to simply hang out, spread feathers, and pull at the singers' clothes.  At one time he actually rides on the Count's neck (!), making it a super-human feat for Bo Skovhus to sing his show-stopping aria.  While a minimalist modern staging (e.g. La Traviata or Eugene Onegin) can work, this foray into Regietheater isn't minimalist, but just weird and falls flat 99% of the time. And I don't mean from all those stairs.

A renowned Austrian conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt leads his very capable orchestra on a path that (quite mysteriously) tries to contort comedy into tragedy.  If it was the slowness itself I could live with it.  But he clearly accentuated lower winds and strings in strategic places, so to speak, and the whole effect is rather menacing.  E.g. Figaro's Act 1 aria where he asks signor contino to dance, or Bartolo's entrance and aria (on a wheelchair!).  Had I not known they're from ""Le Nozze"", I could've easily assumed they're from a tragic opera like Idomeneo.

The voices are marvelous, some more suited to this opera, some less.  I'm absolutely awed by Ildebrando D'Arcangelo's resonant bass, he recently recorded a splendid Don Giovanni, and his Figaro is predictably a commanding figure.  In fact, I would probably prefer a less dramatic sound for this fun character.  Same goes for Anna Netrebko.  She's a consummate actress, so she even manages to pull all the tricks Guth inserted into the play.  But her big dark sound doesn't have an iota of soubrette-ness, so necessary for Susanna.  Bo Skovhus is nearly an ideal Count.  He recorded the role years ago under Abbado and performed it many times, so it became a second skin.  He is, however, severely hampered by, again, the production.  He often has to sing one thing and act another, and so the music suffers.
Dorothea Rschmann has a beautiful voice, but it's much lighter than Netrebko's Susanna's, and when they sing together it's quite distracting.  Still, she manages her two big arias with a lot of musicality and dignity.  Christine Schfer's Cherubino works exactly half the time.  She doesn't come across as a boyish mezzo (in fact, as I was just reminded she's actually a soprano), so her arias while beautifully sung seem a bit out of context.  She acts really well, which is quite an achievement given this overly sexualized production and the hideous clothes she's made to wear. Of the supporting characters I really enjoyed Basilio's ""donkey's skin"" aria, thankfully he was allowed to sing it without any painful distractions, unlike the poor Count.

In the end, kudos to the singers who managed to pull it off despite Guth's and Harnoncourt's best efforts to mess with a perfectly fine opera. For that alone it's worth to get it.  But there are just so many wonderful productions blessedly devoid of extraneous ""finds"" by either the director or the conductor.
If Blu-ray is a must, go for the 2011 Teatro Real, Madrid, production, directed by Emilio Sagi, starring Ludovic Tzier, Barbara Frittoli, Luca Pisaroni, and Isabel Rey, under Jesus Lopez-Cobos's baton.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-nozze-di-Figaro/dp/B005FWEQPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro</a>. The singers are terrific and the traditional period production perfectly captures the humor and the wit of ""Le Nozze"" that Mozart himself and Da Ponte would've approved.  If Blu-Ray isn't a deciding factor, I would recommend the 1985 MET production with Ruggiero Raimondi, Carol Vaness, Kathleen Battle, Frederica Von Stade, and Thomas Allen, directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and conducted by the incomparable James Levine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-nozze-di-Figaro/dp/B0064R8618/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro</a>.
