8349019,1,B0021FP3J0,"This movie is only 74 minutes long, but it seems like it takes forever with the bad acting and even worse directing. There wasn't even a conclusion at the end of the movie; it's like they just got tired of it and quit at some random point.",1399680000,,239,4.1063829787234045

8349021,1,B0021FP3J0,"The cinematography is enough to make your eyes cross right from the first scene.  They used this super load speed camera that can't keep up with a conversation over diner let alone a fight scene.  At one point they were trying to show that one of the fighters was dizzy... It didn't look any different to me.
Story line is okay, Character development descent, acting is, well... it's a B movie but I think the acting and cinematography are just terrible it's not worthy of such a title.
I cut it short after the fight between the main characters when Jesus came home.  The actress who played Jesus' sister, her role was an epic FAIL.  I just didn't want to waste another minute of my life, hopefully my eyes will uncross soon.",1377302400,,726,4.4772727272727275
