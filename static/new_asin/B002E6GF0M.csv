8366925,4,B002E6GF0M,"This DVD is great, though certainly ""low budget."" It is a great addition to a bird guide, and pleasurable to just watch. It is organized like a guide, so it matches how your Sibley's or Audubon's or Peterson's presents orders of birds. Some species have limited representation, which is understandable given the amount of work this thing must have taken to put together, given the limited means the execution suggests the producers must have had.  Anyway, it's great, and that low budge vibe, while endearing and sorta cool, is maybe a reason I give it only four stars.  However, the main is that I wish they'd give a range map for each bird after video footage. This might be easier said than done, but I do find it a shortcoming. At any rate, there is nothing else like this out there as far as I know, and any passive to serious birder can find a way to use it. My favorite use for this DVD is to just watch it with a guide in hand and familiarize myself with birds I might see and to re-assess the birds I often see or at least I think I often see. You can learn a lot by using the DVD in this manner. Follow along with your guide, checking range maps, and overall bolstering your understanding of each order, family, species, whatever. Though sort of ""home-project"" like, and lacking the polish of a five-star product, it is a labor of love--charming, useful, and just great. It is also just pleasing to watch: the land- and soundscapes are beautiful, and make you just want to get out there in nature. I recommend this DVD very much!",1518912000,,1539,4.434628975265018
