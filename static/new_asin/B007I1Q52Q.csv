5088022,5,B007I1Q52Q,My husband is into war movies and history.  He loved it!  I got it for a Christmas present last year and it was a hit.,1322784000,4,118,3.68
5088023,1,B007I1Q52Q,"I purchased The World Wars: The Complete History of WWI and WWII, produced by the History Channel, at a bookstore. It is terrible. The title is deceitful because it should really read: The Incomplete History of WWI and WWII. The HC used whatever old documentaries they could put together and sold it as their own creation. Most of the segments are uninteresting, and the editing is amateurish. Save your money, and don't buy this. I think the History Channel constantly manipulates the public with their leftist ideological beliefs instead of showing an objective view of History, and by this I mean, ""objective,"" in a relative manner, by showing at least two sides of the same issue. They should call themselves ""The Pseudo=-History Channel"".",1278028800,24,743,5.048780487804878

5088065,1,B007I1Q52Q,"I watched it to make sure it was of good quality before giving it as a gift as I intended. I'm glad I did! The explanations of the causes of the two World Wars were over simplified to the point of being useless and a little misleading.  The rest of the time is filled with random, poor quality newsreel films pieced together.  The only redeeming feature is the interviews with the veterans.  Since I have opened the sealed package, I m not sure I can return it but I'm going to try because I will never watch it again and I certainly will not give it as a gift! I am a fan of the History Channel so I am very disappointed in this set.",1416614400,,634,4.056
5088066,4,B007I1Q52Q,"I liked them, they are well made and give you a good over view of the wars",1415664000,,74,3.411764705882353
5088067,1,B007I1Q52Q,"terrible. It is a bunch of superficial 1 hour TV shows all on dvds. They do very little to educate and inform. The totality of WW! is "" a lot of people died and they used machine guns, tanks, airplanes, and gas"". For so many hours of watching you would think they would have some in depth plans and accounts, but you are left feeling like you read the introduction over and over again. VERY SHALLOW AND DISJOINTED",1415577600,,413,4.3076923076923075

5088072,1,B007I1Q52Q,"Just a bunch of old newsreels thrown together, no continuity , nothing like the shows I've watched on TV. Some are 1985 with very poor color, looks like the first color TV  production, hazy and out of focus.",1407542400,,207,4.447368421052632
5088073,5,B007I1Q52Q,This is the first time I actually understand the time line of events.  Best World Wars show ever.  I will watch it over and over.,1407110400,,129,4.12

5088096,3,B007I1Q52Q,Nicely boxed set that has many DVd's. It does fill in some gaps in my DVD library relating to WWI.,1404777600,,98,3.95
5088097,5,B007I1Q52Q,I love anything to do with wars. This is a very interesting documentary on WW1 and WW11. Great job. A must for historical buffs like me.,1403568000,,136,4.269230769230769
5088098,5,B007I1Q52Q,"We've never seen WWI and WWII displayed together in such a way as to help clarify the timeline, the leading characters and the geography of the various key events that were unfolding.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and appreciate how history was ""pulled together"" for us in The World Wars.",1402876800,,284,4.795918367346939
5088099,4,B007I1Q52Q,I needed a brush up on my History and this provided some quality revisits to the past Wars. They could have expounded with probably another 2-6 more hours as some things were just briefly touched upon. I had forgotten how Stalin rose to power and this filled those details.  I was reminded how Chamberlain had a complete appeasing approach to Hitler and thankfully Churchill was the only voice of reason for defending England. I had forgotten Patton slapped a G.I. and was removed from active duty but later recalled to assemble a rouse mission to allow for D-day. Tojo and Japan and the bombs were illustrated and accurate narrative about American lives saved because it lead to their surrender was fair. Yes war world 1 and trench war was covered and the early days of all the pivotal men in 2 were discussed. My 8 year old and I watch in 1/2 Segments. I couldn't say I found overt commentary suggesting a leftist or rightist agenda regarding the interpretation of these historical events. I did however want more on the Air bombings of London; More pivotal naval battles; Discussion of the Final Solution. Certainly this series could have easily been expanded.,1402012800,5,1163,4.786069651741293
5088100,4,B007I1Q52Q,"The History Channel presents a miniseries of six hours on three nights as an overview of the concept that the beginnings of WW I and the events that occurred in that first World War were played out by the same set of characters and in doing so the series presents the backgrounds of each of the major world players in a manner that allows us to see them as individuals rather than historical tropes. Until Amazon makes this available this review is pictured by another series made two years ago with a bit of a different approach. But for those who may be deciding whether or not to catch the current series, hopefully this brief overview will assist.

As the description for the series state, `The World Wars tells the story of three decades of war told through the eyes of various men who were its key players: Roosevelt, Hitler, Patton, Mussolini, Churchill, Tojo, DeGaulle and MacArthur. The series examines the two wars as one contiguous timeline starting in 1914 and concluding in 1945 with these unique individuals coming of age in World War I before ultimately calling the shots in World War II.

Narrated by Jeremy Renner and with comments throughout the series from Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, Leon Panetta, John McCain, John Major, Mario Monti and many historians and correspondents form the US and Britain, the series is a collage of battle scenes (some repetitive, but war is repetitive), but adding the young and old versions of Stalin (Jacopo Rampini /not listed), Mussolini (Nabil Vinas/Jonathan Hartman), MacArthur (Prescott Hathaway/not listed), DeGaulle (Michael Perrie. Jr./Don Meehan), Churchill (Tom Vickers/Ian Beyts), Hitler (Maximillian Klas/not listed ), Lenin (C Conrad Cady), Patton (Matt Dearman/Don Hartman), FDR (Kevin McKillip/not listed), and Tojo (not listed).

The series is directed by John Ealer and written by Chelsea Coates, Zachary Hartmann, Claire Lawton, Alec Michod, Jordan Rosenblum, and David White. No, it isn't all the information about he wars but it is a psychological study of the men who were at the helm of each country involved. It is disturbing but the series does provide insights we should appreciate. Grady Harp, May 14",1401408000,14,2175,5.069832402234637
5088101,1,B007I1Q52Q,Amazon  should not even be offering this pathetic fictitious attempt at history. The effort completely ignored the vital facts of Britain's air war. Much of the time the background music was so loud it drowned out the actors' lines. The history they invented about Hitler had no resemblance to actual history. And the most important events of our war on two fronts were totally ignored. Another decline in the ever foundering role of the History Channel as a valid contributor to modern day television.,1401321600,5,502,4.976190476190476

5088103,2,B007I1Q52Q,Thea's twelve DVDs are merely a collection of smaller sets of DVDs put together.  I was so disappointed as I began viewing and realizes I owned all the subsets separately..,1356825600,5,172,4.733333333333333

8517215,1,B007I1Q52Q,"Glad that I borrowed this for free from my local library rather than paying good money for it.  It's a hodgepodge of various other episodes from the History Channel, thrown together in this ""collection"" simply to sell more copies.

8517220,5,B007I1Q52Q,Very interesting.  Really enjoyed seeing how the events evolved and how they intertwined between the decades.  It gives a thorough picture of how things played out and how the key participants contributed during both World Wars.  Highly recommended.,1421712000,,249,5.5
8517221,5,B007I1Q52Q,"Saw the series when on History Channel and am pleased to have it to watch again and again.  My husband and I are both history buffs, he having majored in history and my having minored in same.  This will make the history of the ""35 years War"" very understandable.  This should be viewed by high school students in AP and regular American history classes.",1421193600,,354,4.5
8517222,1,B007I1Q52Q,"VERY disappointing, and sad that History would put their name on it. (I actually wondered if it wasn't put together by somebody else and they stole the logo to give it street cred) .

Many of the discs are simply a compilation of other videos thrown together, with many of the transitions so broken I felt like I would get whiplash the direction turned so violently. You would be watching one narration, when suddenly it would switch to an entirely different narrator/video that may or may not be an exact continuation of the story. Typically you would be in about the same time period, but it obviously doesnt transition from the first to the second. Its like somebody took a big bunch of older shows/clips and threw together everything quickly with minimal editing just to get SOMETHING to sell.

And I could see them throwing together just a bunch of old programs renamed as a collection, but this is worse. Some stories are roughly (or not) edited stitched together parts of different shows.  I would call some of the segments on this ""Frankensteins"". (15 minutes from show A, 5 minutes from Show B, 20 minutes from Show C, then 10 minutes from Show A again.)

If you can find this for $20 or less, it might be a good buy simply due to the massive amount of raw footage and information. This is NOT a well edited series you would expect from The History Channel, and would NOT be aired on their network ""as is"".",1421020800,,1415,4.537254901960784
