2012147,5,B0001L11LA,"One of my favorite movies. Lambert plays such a different role than his usual sword wielding warrior that it takes you by surprise. Plus it's a star-studded cast, most in their twilight years playing sweet roles; hard to believe this film didn't get more noticed than it did.",1290988800,4,275,4.75
2012148,5,B0001L11LA,"Christopher Lambert ist so und so einer meiner Lieblinge &uuml;berhaupt und immer schon gewesen. Vielleicht liegt es ja auch nur daran, dass er Franz&ouml;sisch spricht und ich Frankreich sehr liebe, aber ich glaube, dass es auch der Blick ist, denn er aufsetzen kann, und dann bekomme ich eine G&auml;nsehaut 1. Grades.....

jedenfalls, kenne ich keinen Film mit oder von ihm, der mir nicht gef&auml;llt. Und einer der Allerbesten ist nun mal GIDEON!!!!!! Er zeigt einfach das wahre Ich im Alter und dass man als alter Mensch auf keinem Fall seine Hobbys und W&uuml;nsche aufgeben soll und darf.... Das lehrt uns dieser Film!

Wenn einem das genommen wird, was man sein Leben lang geliebt und praktiziert hat, dann gibt man die Hoffung auf, und das jehe Ende kommt sofort...

Das h&ouml;rt sich jetzt wahrscheinlich total philosophisch an, ist es aber auch, da es im Film des &ouml;fteren auch erw&auml;hnt wird. Und Charlton Heston als Ober-Philosoph ist total cool und ich glaube auch, dass er im wahren Leben auch dannach gelebt hat.

ich mu&szlig;te nat&uuml;rlich auch sehr weinen, aber ich glaube, dass jeder mu&szlig;, der den Film gesehen hat. Ich bin auch durch Zufall auf diesen tollen Film gesto&szlig;en! hab noch nie mal etwas von ihm geh&ouml;rt. Leider!!!
Aber Gottseidank......

Eines noch: eine der sch&ouml;nsten Szenen war, als er mit den Wildtieren kommuniziert hat!!! Wunderbar!!!!",1288828800,,1403,5.273542600896861
2012149,5,B0001L11LA,"I don't know why I didn't see this movie when if first came out! The list of actors in it alone would draw me to it. It has simple humor in that all of us have experienced and can relate to, yet its message of mortality and ageing touch your emotions and make you realize that anyone of these characters could be you in a few years. Its funny, its sad, but you feel good after watching it. You will want to tell someone else about and offer to bring it over and watch it again with them!",1281830400,4,487,3.979591836734694
2012150,5,B0001L11LA,"Outstanding movie with more accomplished actors and actresses than Gone With the Wind!  Heartwarming!  Some language, but actually it adds comic relief.  You'll have to see it!",1253577600,3,176,5.444444444444445
2012151,5,B0001L11LA,"CAUGHT THIS BY ACCIDENT FLIPPING THROUGH CHANNELS, AND WAS RIVETED FROM THE GET GO....  MANY TEARS LATER I HAVE DECIDED THIS WILL BE ONE OF MY FAVORITES....",1202688000,2,156,4.777777777777778
2012152,5,B0001L11LA,"Apart from ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan"", Christopher Lambert has been relied upon to make action films as the studio's principle source of revenues.

This film actually provides us with something far more substantive and uplifting.

Along with an outstanding cast of previously big name stars like Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors, Shelley Winters, Harvey Korman and more, Lambert gives us a shy, mentally disabled and dying man who provides redemption and new life to a group of seniors who are simply waiting to die.

Gideon Dobbs, who as one character (Mykelti Williams) remarks is ""dumber than a bag'a rocks"", proves that intellect is nothing when compared to selflessness, compassion and a willingness to love your fellow man.

Within the seemingly limited scope of Gideon's apparent idiocy beats a heart that changes the lives of all those around him for the better....That is, with the exception of the Shelly Winters character....the ""mean old bitch from hell....""

This film is a thoroughly uplifting, funny and warm hearted portrayal of one man's love, friendship and the redemption of the human soul.....

Buy it............. I think it's the best thing Chris Lambert has ever done.....

2012153,5,B0001L11LA,"This is among the best films ever made.  I had never heard of it until I found it in a bargain bin.  The ensamble cast is perfect, and Christopher Lambert should have recieved an award for his portrayal as Gideon.",1143504000,12,213,4.3

2012197,4,B0001L11LA,"A mysterious young man moves into a retirement home for reasons that no one can really understand.  As he makes friends with his new neighbors, his easy-going attitude towards life reawakens the desire to not just exist, but to live in the home's elderly residents.  Though his stay at the retirement home turns out to be a brief one, his impact and his spirit live on much longer.  This is a heartwarming movie that is very well acted by classic stars of the screen.",1357689600,,467,4.535714285714286
2012198,5,B0001L11LA,"This is a terrific movie, bring your kleenex girls, it's hard to find, so if u see it advertised on Movieplex chanel, be sure not to miss it, if u r a child of the seventies, u will recognize every1 in the cast.. 2 thumbs up",1348704000,,224,3.891304347826087
2012199,5,B0001L11LA,"I like the movies where the aged screen stars of yesterday gather to give an outstanding performance in a drama or comedy. Think Cocoon, The Crew, or Space Cowboys. This is one of those plots where the grumpy, ""put out to pasture"" crowd in an ""old folks"" home rediscover what they love and get one last shot at doing it due to the arrival of an unusual younger man.

This is a gem for those who appreciate real acting where you identify with the characters. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with Charlton Heston's character. It makes me wonder if he was a deep thinker in his personal life. I also thought that Carroll O'Connor hasn't lost his acting ability.",1338854400,,667,4.558333333333334

2012203,5,B0001L11LA,"Arriving all alone and beautifully dressed the gentle, loving Gideon, much younger than other residents, completely changes the culture of this nursing home.  Through his interactions with other residents he opens up possibilities in each of them from which they create a different life  a different culture from the dreary repetitive submissive one they have been living.  Wonderful understated performamnces by so many beloved and well known actors add to the nice feeling and sense of connection to us this film engenders.

It is definitely a must on any list about the ""spirituality of aging"" and a must see for all nursing home patients and their families reminding them that their personal choices can also create more humane and joyful possibilities than is dispensed by nursing home staff and administrators.  And regardless of our personal conections to nursing homes, this film is a lovely reminder that we do create the life we live..and always have choices.

I hope it will become available here on Amazon for sale.  It's a keeper..a good one to own.",1328400000,5,1062,5.068965517241379

8014032,5,B0001L11LA,"I have loved this movie for years, and my only wish is that they would put it on DVD.  It has so many classic great stars that are now gone and acting legends who did such great acting in this ensemble and the story is such a wonderful thought provoking and heart provoking movie.  Some of the classic acting legends are Charlton Heston, Shirley Jones, Carroll O'Connor, Mike Conners, Harvey Korman, and Shelly Winters.",1470182400,,419,4.648648648648648

8014040,4,B0001L11LA,"Very good story line. Loaded with famous 'older' actors/actress like Shirley Jones, Carroll O'Connor, Charlton Heston, Mike Connors & Shelly Winters. These people can still act & entertain us in their later years, as they did when they were younger. Shows compassion for the elderly, which we will all get there someday, even though when you are young you don't think about old age. Love & respect your elders - - - one day you will be in their place, so you will know how it feels to be placed in a retirement home waiting to leave this world. Christopher Lambert played a great part as Gideon with his talent for movin' & grovin' the residents of Lakeview retirement home.",1395273600,,674,4.625
