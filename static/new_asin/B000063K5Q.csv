1690322,5,B000063K5Q,"What an incredible Abs/glutes workout! Billy Blanks makes sure he gives you a complete workout (by introducing moves besides the basic crunch) to hit every muscle group in your abdomen and gluteus. Billy's extremely personable, is always encouraging, and makes you feel like you have complete control over your workout. This Abs/Glutes workout would be considered by the average person as at an advanced level...so keep that in mind before purchasing. Although this workout is just 30 minutes in duration, it is one of the most intense workouts I have ever experienced, and I am an avid exerciser. It takes extreme control and willpower to complete this tape, but is worth it in the end. I have seen INCREDIBLE results in the month I have owned this tape...amazing definition in the abs, and VERY firm muscles in the gluteus. Billy is constantly reviewing the proper techniques to follow when performing the moves, which is excellent. I have nothing but respect for Billy Blanks and the time and energy he puts into making quality TaeBo videos that will get you the results you have always wanted. As Billy always says, ""If you have the will, TaeBo's the way!""",1026604800,18,1160,4.893401015228426
1690323,5,B000063K5Q,"I love this routine. To me, the 30 minutes fly by, you are constantly moving. I've only had it for maybe 6 weeks, and some parts are a little hard yet for me (flexibility wise), but I can do it all to the finish.
And I can see that it's working! I've measured, I've looked in the mirror, my husband has commented. And the tape is pretty inexpensive. What more could you ask for!",1021852800,25,378,4.121621621621622
1690344,5,B000063K5Q,"This tape will get your abs, glutes and legs in shape FAST.  Since re-incorporating this video back into my workout routine, I have noticed a significant improvement in my abdominal muscles, booty, thighs and legs.  The warm-up and stretching/cool-down segments are about the easiest parts on this tape.  Everything else in between - LOOK OUT!  You WILL be challenged! This is NOT for the beginner; advanced Tae Bo users only.  WORK IT!  WORK IT!  WORK IT! :O)",1292371200,,460,4.896103896103896
1690345,5,B000063K5Q,This video is PERFECT for an athlete looking for a great ab routine.  I've talked body builders into trying it (the kind who do 800 crunches a day) and it totally wipes them out.  Fit it in just once a week to your fitness and diet program and you WILL see results!,1148428800,3,265,4.076923076923077
1690346,3,B000063K5Q,"this workout plays as if it's on fast-forward, down to the music which literally sounds like a cassette tape that's playing in fast mode. and the music has to be the most godawful workout soundtrack i have ever heard! having said that, if you do not want to risk pulling a back muscle, try doing the workout at a slower pace. the ab work is good and works the whole group of muscles BUT there is simply no need to go at that breakneck pace. advanced doesnt mean it has to be faster.",1126483200,,482,4.193548387096774
1690347,4,B000063K5Q,"This was my first Tae-bo tape and had had concerns, since I hardly ever enjoy fast-paced workouts and I usually hate to be shouted at through the TV screen. Now, even though it IS fast-paced and the instructor IS yelling at me like crazy, I still love it. :o)

Combining some of the old-time favorite abs and glutes exercises with new variations AND speed results in a short workout that proves to be real effective. I hardly ever find tapes that leave me feeling the burn afterwards; now, after doing this one for the first time, I could hardly move for two days! I'm not saying it is necessary for a workout to be effective nor is it necessarily good, but it will definitely keep me inspired, since I feel like ""good, so I HAVE done some serious work"".

Having said all that I would like to explain why I've still given this tape only 4 stars. There ARE a few reasons. First of all, they lose count several times, thus completing a few sets more times on one side than the other, sometimes even forgetting some. Also, don't expect very detailed cues, which might mean wrong moves that will either cause poorer results or actually even the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. My last concern is also connected to this: those of you that mainly want to lose some fat on the abs AND then tone them, might actually realize that their abs are GROWING instead of TONING - this workout is VERY tough on abs and even though you'll be sweating like crazy (at least I am :o)), you'd better include some serious cardio in your routine and follow a healthy diet, because this tape alone will not melt away the fat on the abs.",1106697600,12,1622,4.421404682274248
1690348,5,B000063K5Q,"I have done at least more than 15 Abs or buns workout tapes over the years. This is the best!

I have gained 43 lbs with my 2nd baby. With this tape, the pounds just melted away in just 2 months of workout.  Last time with my 1st child, it took one year! This time, I didn't even have to starve from dieting. Just keep a low carb, high fiber diet. I alternate this tape with another one of Tae-bo's Advanced workout. With 2 little kids, I only manage to work out 4 times a week.

I was in a wedding and saw a lot of people I haven't seen for a while. People were amazed how fast I lost the pregnancy weight. The compliments I got is worth EVERY single SWEATING Tae-Bo minute.",1102377600,8,675,4.022388059701493
1690349,5,B000063K5Q,"Probably the hardest thing for a video to do is to keep you interested enough to come back.  After doing these exercises (and enjoying the pain.....) you realize that there is no way you could not have results if you keep doing them....and the workout is only 30 minutes and fun.
This is one of the best of the Taebo tapes.",1070755200,4,323,4.295081967213115
1690350,5,B000063K5Q,"First of all, this video is a great length.  At around a half hour, it gives you an amazing workout.  He starts off with a fast-paced warmup (as usual), then moves into ab work, then some buns, and then a few extra abs before the cool-down.  Most of the moves are ones I've seen in other videos, but he puts the best together to create a wonderful workout.  It makes you nice and sore, and gives you energy to start the day.  Billy is wonderfully motivational as usual, and I find myself working harder when hes watching me, and answering when he asks questions.  This video is great, and I hope he comes out with more in the ""focus"" series soon!  HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!",1047513600,22,667,4.373983739837398
1690351,5,B000063K5Q,"I've had excellent results from the glute portion of this video.  This is the 1st home workout that has really made a difference in my appearance.  However, I didn't get as good as results with the abs as I did with the glutes.  He moves a little too fast and I find it hard to get a full range of motion.  I've combined this workout with Winsor Pilates and now seeing results in the ab area also.",1044748800,10,397,4.116883116883117
1690352,5,B000063K5Q,"this video is about 30mins long, it starts with about a 3-4 minute warm-up and then its an 8 minute abs workout, I will say that the pace goes very fast, and your heart rate will definitely go up a bit, you do crunches of all kinds, and do a few really good exercises for the lower abs, which is excellent because most of us have that problem area that won't go away!!
then proceeds to the buns....all I can say ouch! that goes for about 7-8mins also, for those exersises you get on all fours and lift up the legs to every direction, then lie down on your stomach and do some more buns and lower back exercises, then do some 5 or so minutes of abs, which focus more on lower abs....then a good cool down.
This is a good workout, I highly recommend it to people who are in the advanced level....but when I got it, I was a beginner/intermidiate, and now I can definitely feel harder abs and buns.
Just stick with it!",1037232000,31,914,4.169491525423729
1690353,4,B000063K5Q,"My goal for the year was to get six pack abs, and I think that by using this video daily I may attain my goal!  After 2 weeks I am seeing results, and the 30 minutes is so convenient for my schedule.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of counting errors and some cinematographical problems, but you BARELY notice.  I love this buns workout especially because the moves used are straight out of my kickboxing class and aren't the knee-killer squats and lunges.  All the moves are unique and effective!  Buy this video!",1029369600,,528,4.402061855670103
7959274,5,B000063K5Q,"I love this video & had one for years but it wore out & I have been without it for awhile. I need a floor video while my feet continue to heal from surgery & I remember how effective this work out is from the floor. I havn't been able to find one I like as much. So it's worth having it in VHS because they don't have it in dvd form. I have many Taebo dvd's, this is my all time fave workout.",1470528000,,392,3.6785714285714284
7959275,5,B000063K5Q,Great to deal with. Product is very nice as expected.,1419811200,,53,4.4
7959276,4,B000063K5Q,One of my faves of the Tae-Bo series. I just wish I could find it on DVD instead,1419811200,,80,3.5

7959278,2,B000063K5Q,I just prefer standing workouts more than floor workouts.  I didn't prefer this one because it was harder on my bad knee.,1368230400,,121,4.5
7959279,4,B000063K5Q,This is a great workout for your abs and butt!  Only problem is I don't have a VHS recorder any longer - but... the tape was great while I did!,1364601600,,143,3.7666666666666666
7959280,5,B000063K5Q,Another excellant workout by Billy Blanks. VHS tape was in very good condition. Your abs and glutes will be burning when your done. My husband already noticed my muscles firming up after working out for only a month.,1349827200,,216,4.7105263157894735
7959281,4,B000063K5Q,"This is one of the best abs/butt/hips workouts I've ever experienced.  I definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about toning up.  It's not for the faint-hearted, but it works.  I give this product four stars only because it doesn't come in DVD format.",1327363200,,255,4.883720930232558
7959282,5,B000063K5Q,"I have had this VHS version for SO many years and I have borrowed it out many many times over the yearsand sometimes was hard to get returned! ;) I have tried many other workouts over the years and many other dvd's focusing on abs and glutes but this one is the best by far! You WILL see the results if you follow it! I just wish this workout came on DVD because harldy anyone has a VHS anymore and I'd love to give them for gifts!!
Enjoy! :)",1311897600,,442,3.9775280898876404
