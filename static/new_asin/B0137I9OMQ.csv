8727090,4,B0137I9OMQ,"I'm an old-timey cinema buff, but John Gilbert, famed silent film star, falls outside my wheelhouse. THE PHANTOM OF PARIS is a suspenseful early talkie from MGM and the first Gilbert vehicle I've seen. The man's performance convinces me to explore his other films. This one's based on the Gaston Leroux novel, ""Cheri-Bibi,"" which happens to be the name of our protagonist. And, now, some plot spoilers - you've been warned. Cheri-Bibi (Gilbert) is a celebrated stage magician and escape artist having a grand time working the Parisian circuit. The posters promoting his act tout him as ""La plus grande sensation du monde,"" meaning he doesn't suck. But then he dares to reach above his station by romancing Cecile (Leila Hyams), a mademoiselle of nobility currently stepping out with the Marquis du Touchais (Ian Keith). The ambitious marquis means to marry into wealth and it's M. Cheri-Bibi's misfortune that du Touchais is a first class nogoodnik. When Cheri-Bibi and Cecile's disapproving father (C. Aubrey Smith) engage in a heated verbal spat, du Touchais parlays this into undermining Cheri-Bibi and Cecile's romance. To be exceedingly blunt, du Touchais murders Cecile's father and frames the flamboyant stage magician.

Those gaudy posters also hail Cheri-Bibi as ""L'artist qui disparait"" (""The Disappearing Artist""), and I guess there's truth in advertising because he vanishes behind bars, there to languish for four years. But, then, moments before his scheduled execution, our man breaks out of stir in clever fashion. Bent on revenging himself on the Marquis du Touchais - who, in Cheri-Bibi's absence, ended up marrying Cecile and having a child by her - the fugitive undertakes an audacious impersonation.

Note that THE PHANTOM OF PARIS, bears a similarity, title-wise, to THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. This was originally conceived as a Lon Chaney starrer and titled so as to capitalize on the success of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. When Chaney passed away from cancer in 1930, MGM scrambled to find a leading man and dug up John Gilbert. I say ""dug up"" because, by then, Gilbert's star was on the wane, some say because the moviegoer's shift in taste had evolved past him, some say because his feud with Louis B. Mayer compelled the studio boss to deliberately sabotage his career, some say it was his alcoholism. Whatever the reason, THE PHANTOM OF PARIS constitutes a last chance for Gilbert to make a mark in the talkies. It turned out to be his last hurrah.

He's good here, really good, actually. I hadn't seen him in anything else so I'm not sure how much he lived up to his erstwhile rep as a great screen lover. Here, his performance rides on the strength of his terrific acting and that he's dashing and heroic and silkily plays off his lead actress Leila Hyams. Film buffs more dedicated than I may recognize Hyams for her roles in FREAKS and ISLAND OF LOST SOULS. Regardless of Mayer's rumored rancor against him, MGM gives this 1931 picture the full glossy treatment. There's always an element of wish fulfillment involved when the narrative trots out a magician. Gilbert is very much in his element as the masterful showman. He's convincing in his moments of sleight-of-hand. He conjures up a strong performance, putting the lie to the faltering prowess of a once magnetic leading man. This ends up a fairly satisfying story of revenge and redemption, and I don't know if I mean the plot itself or Gilbert's career.",1457827200,,3440,4.937823834196891
8727091,2,B0137I9OMQ,"Whatever this movie may have lacked, it wasn't the plot. John Gilbert plays a magician falsely accused of murdering his girlfriends father played respectively by Leila Hyams and Aubrey Smith. After he escapes from the sight of police; his girlfriend unwittingly marries the real murderer (Ian Smith). Shortly after their wedding, her husband dies mysteriously and his dead body is carried to a plastic surgeon where John Gilbert impersonates her husband and comes back alive! Confused? But read on, John Gilbert and Ian Smith were most look-alike actors in the pre-code era of Hollywood, which further complicates the plot of the film!! John Meredith directed this concoction that also starred other notable actors like Lewis Stone, Jean Hersholt and Natalie Moorhead. I am a big fan of John Gilbert but disappointed with this movie.",1443052800,,833,5.223880597014926

Has a charm about it and makes you wish that MGM would have put more effort in picking Films for this movie star. John Gilbert did a fine job in playing the character of Cheri-Bibi. It was like having his acting from the 1920s coming alive in the new era of the 1930s. This movie is based on the novel by Gaston Leroux . A nice Adaptation. If you are a fan of Gilbert, this DVD is a must have in your collection. The other actors in this movie did a great job too.. The film moves quickly in the style of the early talkies. I was not sound that destroyed the career of John Gilbert but poorly produced movies. MGM did help in picking good roles or directors. He did the best with what was offered to him. His drinking did not help matters. He was never given a chance to prove himself in the sound era.  His last that film with Greta Garbo  could not restore his career. It is sad. Yet we now can watch many of his films on DVD. I own 25 of his films. He will always be a true Movie Star in my opinion.  Judge for yourself and you will not be unhappy in the long run. The first time I ever saw a John Gilbert movie was on PBS in 1970. The Film was titled: LOVE (1927) starring Greta Garbo  and John Gilbert.. I waited  41 years to find it DVD. A little known fact that  John  Gilbert's silent movies are the most popular films that have revivals  at silent film festivals. Pure Entertainment. Please go find for yourself  the joy of seeing a John Gilbert movie.",1439942400,6,1613,4.088888888888889
