8460817,5,B0057JHMO6,"As the title of my review indicates, this collection is a must for any fan of the Roach lot. Some of these shorts, like PASS THE GRAVY, and SHOULD SECOND HUSBANDS COME FIRST are forgotten classics. There is also the tantalizing footage that survives from LOVE 'EM & FEED 'EM, the only pairing of Davidson with Oliver Hardy. Each disc also includes a bonus talkie: HURDY GURDY on disc one, which depicts a New York tenement populated with every dialect, including that of Kennedy the Cop; and THE ITCHING HOUR on disc two, a rare haunted house comedy, and the only non-Roach entry in this collection. I love this set, and if you've got this far, you probably will too. Please be advised that you will need a region-free DVD player, as it was lovingly created in Europe.",1376524800,6,768,4.572463768115942
