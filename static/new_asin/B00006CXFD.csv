1741974,5,B00006CXFD,"After hearing to this wonderful performance, I couldn't avoid and started to compare it (mentally) to the Met's DVD of this same opera taped in 1980. Both have their strong and weak points:

1- The production: Both Moshinsky (1980) and Faggioni (1991) offer the viewer rather conventional productions that, however, work very well, being inobtrusive to the action (something essential to me).

2- The conducting: Personally, I prefer Giuseppe Patane's (1980) to James Levine's (1991). Sometimes Levine doesn't underline certain moments where this would be most welcome and can also be a bit crude, but these are minor quibbles. Both he and Patane were on the helm of one of best orchestras in the world, so nothing could go wrong.

3- The singers: PAVAROTTI's voice is clearly heavier and darker in 1991 rather than in 1980, but his is a performance to treasure (in both productions). He is to me, the one who best knows how to perform this character. Just watch, in both productions) the way he acts when he learns from Ulrica that he will be murdered. He almost has Gustavo (Ricardo) in his blood. APRILE MILLO is a very good singer, with a nice, resounding voice and with very good acting abillities (just watch her ""Morr, ma prima in grazia""). Her Amelia is a very moving portrayal. I just would like her to sing a little more pianissimo in some moments, which I know she can but, some how, doens't manage to do. KATIA RICCIARELLI in 1980, has a more sweet, less powerful voice, and she, like Millo, plays Amelia with great sensivity and care for the music. Both Amelia's are very good, among the best one can come across with. In my own opinion, both Renato's (almost) steal the show. QUILICO (1980) and NUCCI (1991), though possesing different timbres manage to express, at first, the deep faithfulness of Renato for his King and then, the humiliation and the rage the character feels. QUILICO is the most 'regular' (his first aria is wonderfully sang), NUCCI has a somewhat shaky start, but both reach to great heights as the opera progresses. both do entire justice to Renato's music. Ulrica has always been a difficult character to bring off, because it is only present in one act and because it needs a very low female voice. BIANCA BERINI (1980) and FLORENCE QUIVAR (1991) lack this last, specially the first. Beyond that, BERINI'S voice is not as full as QUIVAR's. Despite this, they both hold their own against the rest of the singers, though QUIVAR seems to me more effective. The only singers who really bring off Ulrica are, in my opinion, LUDWIG (with Solti) and COSSOTTO (with Muti). The Oscar of HEROLYN BLACKWELL (1991) is very well sung and acted, but I prefer JUDITH BLEGEN's (1980) more refined portrayal (specially in vocal terms). Sam and Tom (Horn and Ribbing) are well cast in both productions. WILLIAM WILDERMAN and JULIAN ROBBINS (1980), TERRY COOK and JEFFREY WELLS (1991), have all good voices and make a nice impression.

In way of conclusion, I think both performances are excellent with any weak link. It all depends on the singers one may prefer.",1129075200,47,3081,4.807547169811321
1741975,5,B00006CXFD,"In this modern age of acceptability with anything passing as a voice, especially in Verdi, this DVD is balm.  Pavarotti is lyric but so wonderfully poised and golden toned

and really at his peak in this captured gem.  Millo IS the real thing. Novices harp on

anything to SOUND like they know, they don't. This is the best modern Ameilia of her

day. Warm, rich tone, NO HINT of vibrato,fearless high notes and piani superbly supported and evocative in color.... for those of us who know the Italian sound and who expect it when he hear Verdi....Milanov,Tebaldi, voices with cut and velvet.

She is a thrilling throwback to the day when people knew how to phrase with beauty and poetry, and fill that out with luxurious, molten gold.  She and Pavarotti are a match

for each other pouring out reams of melody and gorgeous singing.  Miss Millo is neither plump or fat here, and looks stunning in this production of Faggioni. Nucci is

a little blustery but always authentically Verdian in phrase and utterance, and Quiver

offers a good reading of Ulrica,a role a little too low for this lovely voice. Levine reminds he is the best in opera with a sensitive, often thrilling reading of Verdi's great score.  This is the one to buy.....for those who know.",1122163200,14,1254,4.701834862385321
1741976,5,B00006CXFD,"I am, as you might glisten from the title, a big fan of this production.  It is right on, from begging to end.  the Metropolitan goes with Verdi's original, set in Sweeden.

  Pavarotti is in his very best form as Gustav.  He has often written that he has a special identification with the Role, we can tell.  he really tries to act.  He is incredibly believable.  He looks like a Big, naieve, fun loving Aristocrat, who waxes melodramatic.  pavarotti brings this straishtforward across wonderfully.  his voice rings solid throuought.

  April Millo is just smashing, no complaints. her Amelia is perfect, and the audience knows it, showering her with praise after her 3nd act Aria.

Her tone is dark, and there are no issues with vibrato as stated elsewhere.  Visually she works well with Pavarotti, they are both middle aged and large.  this is not to say that Millo is not beautiful, for she is.  But is is just the type of beauty that is appropriate for Pavarotti's Gustav.

  To me, Leo Nucci streals the show.  His Renato (Ive forgotten the swedish equivalent) is incredible.  his high notes go right to your ear.  The resonace is so alive.  The A flats and G's are right on pitch with  no strain.  As an actor he bumbles around the stage capable, a very grumpy character, always scowling.  One could understand the coolness between he and Amelia.

  The Ocscar of this production, the name escapes me, deserves special mention for a incredible soprano tone and energentic acting.",1098662400,36,1486,4.75494071146245
1741977,5,B00006CXFD,"Nos encontramos francamente ante una funci&oacute;n del 'Ballo' de grand&iacute;simo nivel, con un reparto que encabeza una APRILLE MILLO (Amelia) en absoluto estado de gracia, bien secundada por LUCIANO PAVAROTTI (aqu&iacute; Gustavo) y un LEO NUCCI (Renato) que, tras un comienzo irregular, no tarda en calentar para ofrecernos otra de sus funciones gloriosas. Entre los secundarios destaca la poderosa Ulrica de FLORENCE QUIVAR, y el punto d&eacute;bil lo encontramos en el sobreactuado y cantado con suficiencia Oscar de HAROLYN BLACKWELL. El resto del reparto cumple con corecci&oacute;n, y JAMES LEVINE lleva bien a la orquesta del MET y la producci&oacute;n es cl&aacute;sica, pero bastante atractiva.",1062028800,4,708,5.752380952380952
1741978,5,B00006CXFD,"It's great to finally have this BALLO on DVD! This has always been one of Verdi's best works and it is handled here with a terrific cast and conductor.  I prefer this recording to the medicore BALLO from 1980, also with Pavarotti, but Ricciarelli and Quilico are nowhere near as effective as Millo and Nucci.  NOt to mention, this production, with a historically acruate setting of Sweden, is much more pleasing on the eye than the barren attempt to recreate colonial Boston of the older production.
BALLO falls flat without a strong tenor, and here we have Luciano Pavarotti, in his mid-fifties, and still producing one of the best tenor sounds out there.  THough his voice is clearly darker and heavier than what it was in 1980, he still handles all the top-notes with ease.  On top of all that, this is the role that he seems most comfortable with- and it shows! He actually attempts to act at times and his death scene is surprisingly very touching and effective.
Aprille Millo is heard here in the midst of her short-lived zenith.  She sings quite possibly the greatest ""Ecco L'Orido Campo"" I have heard at the start of the second act.
Leo Nucci doesn't have the most elegant voice, but he manages to do an excellent job in this and clearly edges out the competition (Quilico & Cappucilli) on the competing versions.
Strong support comes from mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar and soprano Harolyn Blackwell as Ulrica and Oscar, respectively.
James Levine keeps it all together very well and, once again, proves himself a Verdi specialist.",1034208000,102,1539,4.8143939393939394

1742030,4,B00006CXFD,"Having been disappointed with the Pavarotti/Solti recording of ""Ballo"" -- mainly because of problems with microphone placement -- it was interesting to go to this video of a Metropolitan Opera performance almost 10 years later (1991), with Pavarotti at 55, and to notice that the microphones at the Met caught the distinctive timbre and beauty of the voice better than Decca had done in their early digital recording. It's a solid, traditional production, a bit busy in the Ulrica scene, and rather cheesily stark in the scene by the gallows (the love duet scene), but the performers are committed, and, like the Sutherland/Kraus ""Lucia,"" it works. Pavarotti, though too heavy to be very nimble, sounds in very good voice, and only in one or two places does it let him down a bit -- nothing to mar the overall performance, though. Interestingly, he plays Gustavo as a king who takes Ulrica's prophecy seriously, so that ""E scherzo"" is played as a deliberate attempt to make light of a serious matter and not as a carefree blowing-off of the situation. The love duet with Aprile Millo goes very well, except for a moment when Pavarotti can't produce the volume he wants, and Millo covers for him very nicely. Levine knows how to conduct the emotional arc of this scene in a way that escaped Solti. Millo is an absolutely reliable Amelia -- a good-sized handsome voice, more naturally fitted to the part than Margaret Price on the Decca recording, and sounding a bit gusty and loose in her very first scene (in Ulrica's cave), but fine thereafter, in both her solos and concerted pieces. Renato is Leo Nucci, trim as a whippet, with his well-focused but not very rich voice, who puts over the character splendidly. Florence Quivar's voice is almost too lovely for Ulrica's, but you can't complain about that. She's costumed as a kind of voodoo priestess, in the manner of Dr. John on some of his cajun albums! Oscar is Harolyn Blackwell, singing well but a times a little edgily in a role that I always find a bit irritating, no matter who is singing it. The conspirators are solid too, and in general the camera work for video is apt. Most importantly, Levine knows how to shape and pace this stuff, and the orchestra sounds great.

When one listens to CDs as much as I do, I find it easy to forget just how involving a committed live performance can be. This is such a performance -- never mind that Pavarotti is getting old, or that Millo didn't have the distinctiveness of Leontyne Price, or that one would like a bit more richness from Nucci. They're alive in the moment, and it's exciting to hear.",1390262400,2,2601,4.679039301310044
1742031,5,B00006CXFD,"I previously had the Sydney Opera version which looked as if it were a good stage production in there trying to get out that was not captured in their published DVD.  They should be ashamed of themselves for issuing such a low quality production.  In the Australian version you could tell that the stage production was done well.  In the Aussie DVD the sound was terrible and the visual portion was sub-par.  I had to turn up the volume twelve clicks and it was still low fidelity.  I sold the Aussie DVD to Half Price books for a pittance and bought this Metropolitan Opera edition and received a DVD of their usual high standard.  This Met publication was very satisfying.  I recommend buying this.  I have never been disappointed by a Met produced DVD.  In future purchases of Opera DVDs I will stick with those from three sources most of the time.  Metropolitan Opera, Royal Opera Covent Garden,  and Glynbourne.  There are many exceptions of course, but be wary and check for audio quality from  other producers.  The music is everything.

1742032,5,B00006CXFD,"Both protagonists are at their prime in this version of Ballo. Luciano is simply excellentissimo in voice, timbre, presence and even acting.  Milo is perfectly acceptable, and Nucci is quite good.

Those were the days of beautiful sets and the suspension of disbelief.  The new Met production is all suspension of any belief.

1742033,4,B00006CXFD,"This is a great performance with a wonderful cast led by Luciano Pavarotti in great form. His singing is masterful and I did not realise how good an actor he was.

1742035,4,B00006CXFD,"All in all a very good presentation. The Soprano took a little while to warm up, ""Oscar"" was a delight, and Pavarotti was not in his strongest voice but, as I said, a very good presentation.

1742036,4,B00006CXFD,"I purchased this after hearing a number of interviews with Luciano in which he satated repeatedly that Un Ballo In Maschera is his favorite opera.  Interviewers were trying to put words in his mouth and Luciano kept repeating, no...that Ballo is his all time favorite, then stated his reasons.  I purchased this performance based on Amazon customer reviews.  Pavarotti, Nucci and Milo and Levine are suprub, as usual.  However, when I will be shopping again I will look for a different production.  Not, of course, because I already bought this one...but, because I believe I'd find better renderings of this opera with Luciano Pavarotti.  Please shop around.",1199750400,6,659,5.11214953271028
1742037,5,B00006CXFD,"Un Ballo In Maschera has long been my favorite Verdi opera since seeing it first, live, with Placido Domingo and Gilda Cruz-Romo in Ft. Worth in the late 60's.  I've seen and heard it many times since, but my new DVD with the exceptional cast of Pavarotti, Millo, Nucci & Blackwell is the best ever.  The love scene brought tears such as only perfect beauty can induce, and the death of King Gustave (Pavarotti) brought tears of sadness as I realized that this incomparable singer is forever silenced.  Thankfully, there is an enormous library of his recordings available, and I couldn't recommend any one more than this opera for the new opera-buff.",1191628800,8,650,4.785714285714286
1742038,5,B00006CXFD,"This opera runs a little over two hours, and it will be the fastest two hours of opera you will ever see.  James Levine and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra support a superstar cast.  The costumes and set are magnificent.  This DVD is a must-have for your collection.

One thing that I found unusual about this opera is the lack of any big choruses, the normal Verdi trademark.  It doesn't matter.  What choruses there are were well-sung by the Met chorus.

The principals are stunning, starting with former Broadway star Harolyn Blackwell as Oscar.  She has a leggiero soprano that is clear as a bell, and she is captivating on stage.  The great baritone Leo Nucci sings the role of Renato, the jealous husband of Amelia, and the guy who gets to stab Pavarotti in Act 3. His best scene was definitely the opening aria of Act 3 (""A tal colpa e nulla il pianto"").  In this aria, he is convinced that wife Amelia has been having an affair with King Gustavus, and vows to kill her then and there.  It was very well sung and convincingly acted.

Big-voiced mezzo Florence Quivar sings the juicy part of Ulrica, the gypsy/witch/fortuneteller.  You will not believe her low notes, so have the home theatre system or TV speakers turned up.  She is a true Verdi mezzo.  Her voice has serious cut in all the registers.  She dominated the stage every time she sang.

The legendary Luciano Pavarotti sang Gustavus.  This performance was recorded in 1991, when Pavarotti was still on his game.  What is so amazing to me in watching him is that he had absolutely no tension anywhere.  He proves that you don't have to bust a vein to produce sound.  He has some spectacular moments in this opera.  I loved the singing in his big scene with Amelia in Act 2 (""Teco io sto""/""Gran Dio!"").  Pavarotti got on my nerves in this scene because, even though it is a love duet, he never even looked at Aprile until the end.  I guess he just had to keep his eye on the prompter.  He sang it well, though.  His death in Act 3 was very well sung.

Aprile Millo was just fantastic in the coveted role of Amelia.  Interestingly, she didn't ""grow into"" Verdi roles, she sang them from the beginning.  When you hear her sing this role, you'll see why.  Her first big aria (""Ecco l'orrido campo""-""Ma dall'arido stelo"") was superb.  But her next big aria (""Morro, ma prima in grazia"") was a literal showstopper.  It drove the Met crowd into loud and prolonged cheering.  The acting in this aria was amazing.  This aria follows husband Renato's aria, when he threatens to kill her.  In her aria, she asks to hold her son one last time before she dies.  At one point, she reaches for Renato's hand begging for forgiveness.  He coldly rejects her.

What a great performance.  We are lucky to have it available on DVD.

Highly recommended.",1171152000,23,2801,4.546184738955823

7967153,4,B00006CXFD,"This is a traditionally costumed and, for the most part, a traditionally staged version of this opera. A few scenes left me puzzled, such as when Oscar (the page) presents the ball invitation, to Amelia. Why is Oscar accompanied by two weirdly dressed and weirdly posed characters, who seem to have no relevance to the activity at hand? Also, why is Oscar being portrayed partly as a page a partly as a clown/court jester? Many of this characters motions and actions don't seem to fit the rest of the story.

 Other than that, Oscar, portrayed by female singer Harolyn Blackwell, is very well sung, as are the parts of Amelia (Aprile Millo) and Gustave 3rd (Luciano Pavarotti).

 Why is it that the creators of todays DVD and BlueRay recordings seem to insist that we spend time in the orchestra pit, before the start of the opera, as well as between the acts? Who really cares about the mechanical motions of the orchestra or the conductor, required to provide the music? The music should be background to, not interfere with, the enjoyment of the opera.

 I couldn't give this recording a 5 star rating, only because of those inappropriately presented characters and the annoyance of the multiple orchestra pit scenes.",1462147200,,1220,4.813397129186603

7967157,3,B00006CXFD,"Piero Faggioni has achieved the impossible.  He has taken Verdis turbulent and stirring Un Ballo in Maschera and converted it into a dull, plodding and almost lifeless production.  Much is made of the fact that this production reverts to the use of late 18th-century Sweden as the setting for the opera and the apparent use of Verdis original libretto before the Neapolitan censors compelled him to relocate the opera setting to colonial Boston.  However, apart from the occasional reference to Sweden in the libretto and the use of the name Gustavo for King Gustavus III, the difference between this production and many others set in Boston is very small.

We have become accustomed in recent years to enjoying opera as a total theatrical spectacle in which the story plays a role almost as important as that of the singing.  The Faggioni production reverts very much to the really old-fashioned stand up and sing type of style.  Much of the blame for this devolves on Mr. Pavarotti.  His large size limits his ability to move around the stage.  Worse than this is his almost total lack of involvement in the opera plot.  He often looks as if he wishes he were anywhere but on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera.  His acting, if one can call it that, consists of raising one or other of his two eyebrows.  The great Teco io sto/Gran Dio love duet between him and Amelia (as sung by April Mille) while sung well is almost lifeless.  Mr. Pavarotti hardly casts a glance in the direction of Amelia while he apparently strains to look at the prompters box.  At the masked ball in Act III he looks more like a beached whale than a dying monarch.

Ms. Millo sings beautifully and her Morro, ma prima in grazia in the second act is as good as it gets and she deserves the strong audience applause that she gets.  However, her facial expression hardly changes during the course of the opera and is confined to occasional squinting.  Mr. Nucci as Renato (Anckarstrom) sings steadily but moves around the stage with a frozen scowl on his face.  His Eri tu che macchiavi quell anima in Act III seemed rather lifeless and it is only in the trio with Counts Ribbing and de Horn that follows Eri tu that we hear some really stirring Verdi singing.

The lesser roles are on the whole reasonably well done.  Florence Quivar as Ulrica does not attain the contralto depth that the role requires but sings well and her Re delabisso in Act I is very good indeed.  Harolyn Blackwell as Oscar is a ray of sunlight in this lugubrious production.  The roles of Counts Ribbing and de Horn are well sung by Jeffrey Wells and Terry Cook.  Indeed, the scene in Act II in which the conspirators find Anckarstrom in an apparent liaison with his own wife near the gallows at midnight is probably the best in the entire opera.

The sets for this opera are very bleak although there is some improvement for the masked ball in Act III.  The costumes appear ridiculous often.  Maestro Levines slow tempos throughout the opera seem to contribute to the dullness of the production.

The quality of the DVD is somewhat poor.  One has to make allowances for the fact that the video was obtained in 1991.  Close up shots of the performers are adequate but slightly distant shots of the entire stage are grainy and unappealing.  Colors are drab and look washed out and the stage lighting is poor.  The audio quality is excellent.

The Metropolitan Opera Company seems to have no luck with their productions of Verdis great opera.  The 2012 production with Sondra Radvanovsky, Marcelo lvarez, and Dmitri Hvorostovsky, conducted by Fabio Luisi seemed pretty bizarre and I would not buy a DVD of it if it ever became available.  The fact that the Met can do Verdi well is shown by their more recent and excellent revival of their 1983 production of Verdis Ernani which Im hoping will become available soon on Blu-Ray DVD.  I found this 1991 production of Un Ballo in Maschera so boring that I really cannot recommend it to anyone who is not a diehard Pavarotti fan.",1410480000,4,4023,4.635593220338983
