8656689,5,B00K7ZIZMS,An excellent video on one of the worlds great cities. If you have never been to Istanbul this video will give a wonderful tour of what is to be seen. A truly a great video.,1421712000,,172,3.942857142857143
8656690,5,B00K7ZIZMS,"My wife and I have travelled with Grand Circle Travel in Turkey, and were fortunate to have  Serif Yenen, the originator of this DVD,  as the director on our trip.  He is an excellent director & teacher, and a ""living encyclopedia"" on Turkey.  The DVD on Istanbul is very good, indeed excellent!",1418688000,,295,4.615384615384615
8656691,5,B00K7ZIZMS,"My friend and I enjoyed ""Turkey Unveiled"" very  much.  Having been to Turkey twice, It brought back wonderful memories.
The director of this documentary,Serif Yenen, was our guide on both of our trips and what a great knowledgeable guide.  He has also  written a wonderful book on Turkey called ""Turkey Odyssey"".",1409270400,3,312,5.0588235294117645
8656692,1,B00K7ZIZMS,"Ordinary travel movie, very disappointing when there is so much history/interest in this city. I would not recommend this.",1407024000,2,122,5.473684210526316
8656693,5,B00K7ZIZMS,"I loved this documentary because it does so much more than tell you what to do and see in Istanbul.  It also shows different aspects of the culture by way of interviews with Turkish people.  (Watch the baklava maker.  Amazing!) You hear a belly dancer, a whirling dervish, the imam of the Blue Mosque, a prominent business woman, and others tell about (and demonstrate) their lives and their occupations.  It's fun to watch.  Beautiful photography.",1400371200,2,448,4.92
