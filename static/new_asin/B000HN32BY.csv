2639405,5,B000HN32BY,"FYI Previous Reviewer: You know what else is so yesterday? Using the phrase ""so yesterday.""",1504828800,3,91,5.133333333333334
2639406,5,B000HN32BY,"I have been waiting for years hoping this would be released to DVD. I used to own the VHS copy years ago and haven't got a clue to why I gave it up back in my trading days. I kept everything else in Alice's catalog, but I let this one slip away. I am so happy and am going to pre-order very soon. Now, if the original appearance of Alice on the Smothers Brothers show performing ""Unfinished Sweet"" could be released, this would totally be wonderful!",1501545600,6,449,4.232558139534884
2639407,5,B000HN32BY,"How nice that this great show is FINALLY coming to DVD. Couldn't care less that it's not available on Blu-ray, since a nice DVD copy will look good on good equipment, anyway! Just let the AUDIO be excellent, please.",1501372800,7,215,4.538461538461538

2639409,5,B000HN32BY,"I am so excited to see ""The Nightmare"" released on DVD. I have a VHS ripped DVD and I'm hoping the official disc will be clearer quality. Yes, bluray would be better. The tv special with Vincent Price is a true classic. I had requested tat to be released a couple time through Alice Cooper's radio show email.",1500595200,4,309,4.344827586206897

2639412,5,B000HN32BY,"The Nightmare is a must see for fans of the Welcome To My Nightmare album. With some changes to the music and lyrics, it is a real treat to hear these alternate versions. Vincent Price is always cool. The sound and picture quality are exactly what I would expect from a 1975 production. This is a trip back in time well worth taking!",1519862400,,333,4.301587301587301

2639415,3,B000HN32BY,"The VHS transfer of ""The Nightmare"" which is why I bought this, ooks exactly as good as my own VHS transfer! You would think they would have gotten a better source than the VHS tape! The live WTMN show looks exactly like the last 2 releases! At least they are released but the quality is very poor.",1517616000,2,298,4.245614035087719

2639420,1,B000HN32BY,"Worse DVD of Cooper's performance EVER!  Not only is the dvd of poor quality, the last 3 songs on the dvd are so corrupted, you can't make out any part of the songs, visually or musically. It pauses, blinks, skips, freezes, etc. all at the last few minutes.  I am a HUGE Cooper fan and can't stand watching this dvd; I am so sorry I wasted my money and bought into the reviews that it was so great! I would never recommend any one purchase the dvd.  This dvd is not the original ""Welcome to my Nightmare Concert"" but rather some conglomeration from the TV special ONLY.  I feel I was mislead into believing this was the concert version  plus the tv special.  NOT THE CASE AT ALL!",1514937600,,679,4.265625
2639421,5,B000HN32BY,"Alice Cooper,this is a great DVD,been waiting ever since I messed up the VHS copy that took me years to find back in 1984! This is great!",1514505600,,137,4.111111111111111
2639422,5,B000HN32BY,"I am very happy this finally came out on DVD. Film quality better than expected considering old TV source material, and of course Alices Performance is amazing. Great for any Alice Cooper fan and/or Vincent Price fan.",1514246400,,217,4.891891891891892
2639423,5,B000HN32BY,I saw this show when it was originally shown in theaters.  I've been a BIG fan ever since.,1513814400,,90,4.0
2639424,3,B000HN32BY,"I was somewhat disappointed with this. I expected poor audio and video, but they aren't that bad. I was looking forward to the concert, but the tv special was better than the concert.
Perhaps with the timing of this tour Alice was suffering from the effects of the lifestyle that led him to go to rehab just prior to from the inside. I'm not sure, it just seems a little short of the mark.  The band is good and there is a nice face off between Hunter and Wagner that is worth a look. The audio is ok, but the mix is not very clear and it detracts from the prcedings and leaves Alice sounding a bit ragged.
The tv special is more coherent if not somewhat schmalzy.
If you are an Alice freak get it, if you are just a passerby keep on walking.",1512864000,,742,4.117241379310345
2639425,5,B000HN32BY,For film from the 70's this looks and sounds great...not only the TV special but also the concert. very recommended.,1511913600,,116,4.85
2639426,3,B000HN32BY,"Alice Cooper has been hit or miss for me over the years. When he's on, I love him. I definitely like his earlier work better than the  stuff he's been churning out the past few years. Nightmare was a great album. The tv special is very Alice in the sense that it's very odd, and dark. It was also pretty cheesy, even for the 70's. The live performance how ever is great. Though I tend to lean more towards live shows in general since I'm a musician.",1511654400,,449,4.160919540229885
2639427,5,B000HN32BY,"The Welcome To My Nightmare movie has been previously released on DVD, but the The Nightmare TV special finally sees its first DVD release in this package. The video/audio quality of the special is the best that we have seen on home video, the only other official release being on VHS in the early '80s. The only extra in the package - but I guess the Nightmare itself is really an extra - is an eight-page booklet containing photos and liner notes.",1510963200,,449,4.487804878048781

2639433,3,B000HN32BY,"The concert footage, which was professionally shot, looks and sounds fine.  The TV special, however, looks to have been sourced from videotape (and maybe not even a first generation copy) and looks horrible in places - lots of video noise and color blobs.  I'm guessing this was shot on videotape instead of film, and thus couldn't really be ""remastered.""  I accept it for what it is, but it was still disappointing.",1508803200,2,416,4.830985915492958
2639434,5,B000HN32BY,"I saw this tour in Buffalo, NY back in 1975 and was thrilled. WTMN remains one of Coopers greatest triumphs. The audio for the concert was never very good but the visuals were fun to watch.
The TV special was interesting to watch as a teenager but some of the songs were slightly different from the album versions.
I listen to WTMN every Halloween and it still packs a thrill.",1507852800,4,376,4.385714285714286

2639437,5,B000HN32BY,"To Heck with all of these Bad reviews... The actual show was on tv when??? 1975 I think..  And people have been wanting it on DVD for years... It was taped in the mid-70's.... It has finally came out on DVD.... And you always have some punk complaining about something.... Even when It was announced this was coming out on DVD... The what I call Blu-People were already complaining about why it isn't it coming out on blu-ray??? Which is a very stupid question...
  To me?... I am really happy it came out on DVD... I am a vary big fan of Alice Cooper....And I have no complaints about the DVD... the actual tape came out over 40 years ago... There is nothing at all wrong with it.... And to get it so cheap... I'm proud of it.... To Heck with those Punks giving it less than a 5 star review... especially the Great blu-people.... they are truly STUPID asking why it wasn't released on the blu-ray.",1506988800,4,898,4.365269461077844
2639438,5,B000HN32BY,Fantastic! I've waited forever for this to come out on DVD and it was worth the wait. Classic Cooper!,1506988800,2,101,4.368421052631579

2639441,4,B000HN32BY,"The Nightmare is just slightly better then the VHS. There is a little bit of hum in the audio that the VHS tape dosn't have.  The picture is a little sharper when it comes to close ups but otherwise isn't that big of a upgrade.
 What you are missing from the Rhino release of WTMN is the 5.1audio as this is 2.0, the A.C. commentary track, Memorabilia Quiz/Game and the 25 minute interview with Alice.",1506297600,4,401,4.333333333333333

2639443,4,B000HN32BY,"So happy that this is finally on DVD. The down side is the quality is not very good. It looks like it's been through countless dubs. I suspect the master is long gone or just wasn't available. I wouldn't be surprised if someone out there somewhere has a better looking bootleg. BUT at the end of the day, its still a great TV special with that great cheesy 70's production and editing style. I love Vincent Price's ""How much are they paying me again?"" look on his face!",1505692800,4,469,4.340909090909091

2639445,5,B000HN32BY,"Love this DVD, have been waiting a long time for the Nightmare! The Nightmare TV special is taking a trip back to 1977, it's cool that Alice recorded different vocal performances for the TV special, Devil's Food is pure gold, Alice's vocal performance is great, so are the other songs on the TV special. Of course there are chessey moments, but it's the Coop, and the 70's! The live concert from Wembley is also great. I have had the Rhino DVD for years, this one seems a little brighter and the sound is a little more bottom heavy, just wish that the DVD commentary from the Rhino release was on here too. The only con for me was that the DVD came in a Blu-ray style case. Other than that this DVD would get a 6th star if there was one!",1505433600,2,737,4.23404255319149
2639446,5,B000HN32BY,"get it while you can... I have been waiting for the VHS replacement...  my VHS had those lines going through it , so I am happy to get this version of The nightmare which I remember on TV in 70s, my fav. of all cooper stuff :) if you love that record, you will love this movie like video of the whole album and Vincent price is awesome :) classic. at. I will buy the nightmare again if they put it on blu-ray or find any extras, but it was tv stuff, so I'm sure nothing will be found. so I am guessing this will be the release for many years. better quality from original tapes would be nice though :)",1505347200,2,601,3.9669421487603307

2639448,1,B000HN32BY,"Had to give a star but it deserves none. Playing this on cheap tv speakers might be ok if you don't care about sound in the least bit. I couldn't get thru the 1st song. Sounds like headphones laying in the middle of the floor. The only thing about ""Special Edition"" is the money I wasted with high expections that it would be a listenable dvd  being a brand new release of and old product. I will take this garbage to someones house and leave it tucked into their couch cushion and deny ever owning it if asked.",1505347200,,511,4.214285714285714

2639450,5,B000HN32BY,"This is the first time ""The Nightmare"" has been released on DVD, so this is a welcome addition to any Alice Cooper fan's collection.  The quality is about as good as you could expect from a release that is not fully restored and cleaned up, and it is MUCH better than the VHS edition.  The concert video is the same as the previous ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" DVD.",1505001600,6,362,4.3088235294117645
2639451,5,B000HN32BY,"I've been waiting for The Nightmare to be released on DVD! I've been tempted on buying the VHS or Beta for a while and I'm glad I didn't. This is one disc, The Nightmare coupled with its concert. The Nightmare is a cheesy masterpiece,  but Alice and Vincent Price's performances shine through.

And to the previous reviewer: What would be the point of having this on BluRay? There would be no noticeable difference considering the quality of these 40 year old tapes. No point or reason to make a BluRay.",1504915200,9,503,4.5777777777777775
