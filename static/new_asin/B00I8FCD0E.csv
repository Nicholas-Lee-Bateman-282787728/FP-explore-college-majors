It is triumphant in distilling the sweeping spirit of the novel and in augmenting the humane and compassionate nature of the principal characters - lending this version a sympathetic and emotional nuance.

In this version, Christian Duguay, the director, succeeded in giving utmost respect not only to each of the story that was chosen to be told - without any artifice that would distract viewers from the heart of the story - but also to each of the characters that were brought to life as whole as possible from Tolstoy's ink.

The multinational cast artfully supported the director's vision, with Vittoria Puccini at the helm as the eponymous heroine. Vittoria was stunning, dignified and, above all, she was a remarkably convincing Anna. As Count Vronsky, Santiago Cabrera possessed a powerful and seductive presence  he was masculine, composed and confident. Anna and Vronskys adulterous love story was unabashedly captivating and bold, owing to solid build-up and tug-of-war between the two, as well as passionate performances by Vittoria and Santiago. Benjamin Sadler also offered a standout performance for his steely and rather intimidating Karenin.

The production value deserves songs of adulation, with its lavish, palatial sets and indulgent period costumes of 19th-century Russian opulence, as well as mesmerising camerawork that contrasted the atmospheric loftiness with revealing close-ups of the characters' intimate emotions and turmoils.

Of course, not every character, encounter and discourse in the novel could be transplanted onto the screen within a three-hour timeframe, and such condensation of scenes and characters  as well as the modernisation of some dialogues - was fair and did not compromise the overall soul of the story.

All in all, this was a truly ravishing, satisfying and resonant interpretation of an esteemed piece of literature. Of all the other versions Ive seen, this was the only version where I felt emotionally responsive to Anna and her harrowing story, and it has easily become my favourite adaptation. A new soaring benchmark for Anna Karenina has been set and it deserves to be seen and exalted by readers of the novel, as well as fans of wonderfully crafted period drama experience.",1397260800,11,2386,5.363636363636363
