2205642,4,B0007989RU,"A black comedy set in the 1950s about Freya, a woman who returns to Iceland after spending several years in America. An air of mystery pervades her. In the eyes of her young cousin Agga, she is an evil woman, a murderess on the run and one who will kill again. But this is not a mystery, a whodunnit or a thriller. It explores the role of Icelandic women in the 50s, that strange time after the war when women who had gone out to work when their menfolk were away, again find themselves back in their traditional roles as housewives.

The film is beautifully shot and evokes a strange, little seen landscape of permanent ice and barren black rock. The landscape is sere, almost devoid of color, which makes Freya's vibrant red, green and blue fashion statements stand out in truly stark contrast.

The film was apparently released with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (very wide) but this DVD from HVE (Home Vision Entertainment), affiliated to Criterion, is an open-matte version at 1.85:1 letterboxed into a 16:9 anamorphic widscreen. Very strange. There is no statement to say that this is a director-approved release although the director, Agust Gudmundsson, did write the introductory essay in the accompanying leaflet. Comparing the 1.85:1 main feature to the 2.35:1 versions of the deleted scenes and various trailers, I personally found the 1.85:1 picture composition more satisfying. But this was obviously not the theatrical release version so I'm quite confused.

The film is in Icelandic, a little heard language, and the DVD comes with optional English subtitles.

Despite the questionable choice of aspect ratio on this DVD, it is still a beautiful transfer of a lovely film and well worth buying.",1111536000,10,1705,4.930313588850174
2205643,5,B0007989RU,"Takes place in a small town in 1950's Iceland where a local  woman returns from America with contemporary ideas and attitudes, and the latest fashion, and turns the town on its ear . . . think Betty Davis Does Iceland. The storyline follows the influence she has on a young, impressionable but spirited female relative, as well as the affect on men and women in the town as a whole. It's a delicious, dark slice of life from a place/time I knew nothing about--a commentary on strong women and conformity.  A fresh, original film, by a woman, of course.",1105142400,7,552,4.565656565656566
8046061,5,B0007989RU,"This is a marvellous little black comedy about what happens upon the return from the US of Freja (Margret Vilhjalmsdottir) to her Icelandic hometown.

Actually, it's about the sorry things that happen to those who cross her, or the people in the family-coven that takes her in. But I won't spoil the watching. The setting is an Icelandic fjord village-port; really, a world largely dominated by women. Freya, the main character, is possibly a witch and most certainly a bitch - er, sorry: a force to contend with - but in any case, the tale is told from the child's perspective.

Ugla Egilsdotti plays the 11-yr-old Agga. It's a complex role, where Agga must ultimately decide whether to be loyal either to what's right and fair, or to her kind: i.e. women. Egilsdotti is especially promising as an actress. This is a ladies' film pretty much throughout, although there's enough androgyny and misogyny here to keep most any healthy male giggling away with recognition: self- and other!

Witty, unusual and ironic throughout, this low-budget flick from a still poorly-known, tiny country is disproportionately well worth watching.

8046062,5,B0007989RU,"Bought this video based on excellent reviews in preparation for a trip to Iceland in summer 2011.  Watched by myself first time and was absolutely blown away by nearly all aspects of this film.  A strong interesting story line of the return to Iceland of a beautiful mysterious woman who may be hiding a dark past and her interactions with both men and women, young and old, old acquaintances and new and, most importantly, with a young girl who lives in a house populated by five women and into which the protagonist settles (or, unsettles, as the case may be).  Although the story line centers on the mystery woman, it is her effect, as well as the effect of all of the other characters, on the young woman (girl turning to woman over the course of the film) that really is the main subject and theme of the movie.  Without detailing the plot, let me just say that for a man who struggles with the significance of American Feminism, this was a powerful story of strong women and the challenges they face.  This is not ""put the toilet seat down"" or ""I can open my own door, thank you very much"" feminism.  It is, rather, ""take one more step and you lose most of what you seem to value in life"" feminism.  I watched this film subsequently 2 more times; once with my recently college graduated son who loves cinema and my wife who enjoys film, but doesn't live for watching movies, and both of them loved the movie at least as much as I.  Both felt it to be a movie of significance as well as supremely well written, acted and filmed.  Highly recommended.  My other favorite Icelandic film, BTW, is ""Noi.""",1316390400,,1604,4.4436860068259385
8046063,4,B0007989RU,"Good flick, but not for everyone. No spoilers here, but I want to warn people that this is a dark movie. Yes, it's sort of a comedy, but a distinctly dark one. There is an abundance of irony, but not many laugh-out-loud moments. Interestingly, the most sympathetic characters are three oldest: two older women who work in a fishery and the husband of one of them, an old fisherman with strong socialist leanings. Class distinctions and snobbery of the Iceland of the early 1950s are an important undercurrent. Freyja, the main character, is an intense and headstrong seductress with a number of admirable qualities. But, and that's a crucial but, those are not the only qualities she possesses. It helps to know that Freyja is the name of a Norse goddess who is often associated with lust as well as battle and death. Those with some knowledge of Icelandic lore would realize the significance of Freyja's nightly walks. Not knowing this, however, probably does not detract too much from the movie. I better leave it at that, so as not to reveal too much.",1234051200,4,1054,4.733695652173913
8046064,4,B0007989RU,"This remarkable little dark comedy from Iceland is not so little. It tells a rambling story of women in a remote part of the world dealing with men who make poor marriage material. From the three village drunks to an engineer in a fine house, there is not a one to provide a secure home and a lasting relationship. A handsome young policeman seems the sole exception, but he has trouble accepting the truth about this war between men and women when he's presented with the facts, which happen to come from the mouth of an 11-year-old girl he believes is making up stories. When she finally grows into a young woman herself, he's ready to believe her, but by then she has become self-protective and deceptive, like all the older women before her.

Set in the early 1950s it centers on the affairs of several women living together in the house of an older sailor who is for the most part at sea and earns a degree of respect within the framework of the film by being a) a socialist and b) absent most of the time. A cousin returning from America after the sudden death of her young husband (a murder?) settles in with them and makes her presence known in town as a kind of Rita Hayworth in its midst, catching the eye of its most eligible bachelor while taking matters into her own hands when the men who cross her path step out of line. Full of ironies and dark humor (it begins and ends with the Crew Cuts' song ""Shboom""), the film is also beautifully photographed with a large cast of characters. The DVD has a brief making-of featurette and deleted scenes. For filmgoers who like something way out of the ordinary.",1229817600,5,1616,4.441077441077441
8046065,5,B0007989RU,"Dark comedy is pretty common in Iceland, and I've got to say this is actually fairly light. Children's stories in Iceland are darker humor than this. Really, it's not so bad. ;)

What I loved about this film is it took me home. My family is from Hafnarfj&ouml;rur. The sound of the snow crunching under their feet, I could almost taste the p&ouml;nukukur and the kleinur... Hiding and playing with friends while my Amma was sewing... The stories about the elves in the hills.. running through the lava fields. i can't vouch for the representation of how the rich live, but Agga's life and family definitely took me home.

I highly recommend it to other Icelanders.",1191283200,3,664,4.7155172413793105
8046066,5,B0007989RU,"""The Seagull's Laughter,"" an Icelandic film, just goes to show you that great things can come from small countries. A somewhat ""black comedy,"" the film revolves around Freya, who returns to her family in a small Icelandic fishing town after being widowed in America. She sets herself out to improve the social standing of herself and her relatives, and a few fatal ""accidents"" occur in the course of her social climbing. Freya's younger cousin is unimpressed, and frequently reports her actions to the town's lone policeman as homicide. The policeman, fascinated by Freya, pooh poohs the younger girl. There's even a great twist at the ending of the film.
Worth buying, and it should be seen over and over again!",1190937600,3,712,4.941666666666666
8046067,4,B0007989RU,"First and foremost, this movie is rated a big, fat ""R."" It contains nudity and sexuality in a big way!

The first WOW of this movie is the main character. She's stunning, graceful, underhandedly empowered, and oozing sexuality in a non-femme fatal sort of way--at least the magistrate and all but the young cousin assume she's harmless, that is.

The second WOW of this movie is the style! My but they dressed these women beautifully! If you love the style of the post-WWII years, this is one of the best movies to watch!

The third WOW is garnered from the intriguing plot line. On the surface, the story appears to be about a widow who goes about the not-so-hidden task of finding a replacement husband--preferably one who will help her keep the lifestyle she was accustomed to in the States. But then there are the layers...

Fascinating story!",1189296000,3,847,4.702702702702703
8046068,5,B0007989RU,"I pulled this movie off the shelf at the Seattle Public Library not knowing what to expect. Was I pleasantly surprised.

A chapter in the age-old struggle between the sexes. Here the women are on top. The men of the small Icelandic village are-with the exception of the fisherman grandfather-stupid and often drunken louts. The women are superior-if only by default. It is called a dark comedy, but the men who get bumped off are so loathsome their deaths are not very dark. And the killings are more self-defense in the broader sense than premediated murder.

I do disagree with those reviewers who see Freya the cousin who returns from seven years in America as the feminist heroine. Instead Freya is just another attractive female who cunningly uses her sexuality against men. Her quest is merely for material gain and status. She is an Icelandic Becky Sharp.

The real hero I think is Agga, wonderfully played by Ugla Egilsdottir. She is a shrewd observer of the follies of the adults around her -with a gift for profitting from their antics. As she matures from age 11 to 14 she comes to understand that the men around her are not to be trusted. She begins to acquire her cousin's sexual allure, but with a deeper understanding of the world than the merely staus-conscious Freya.

A superb movie well worth watching and owning. I only wish the novel on which it is based was available in English.",1169251200,2,1401,4.706122448979592
8046069,5,B0007989RU,"Other places provide good descriptions of this movie; I'll just mention how it made me feel, which is lighthearted and happy.

These are characters you'll never forget from a world that no longer exists in land that is timeless. The story is full of warmth, humor, paradox, and intrigue.

The protaganist, Freya, is beautiful, cunning and principled;is she a witch or a saint? You're never really sure. Agga, her 11-year old foil, tracks her every move and often directs the action; she's a clever and wise 11-year old who's also a kid's kid, given to spontaneous cartwheels and pre-adolescent sulks. Together, the two set an entire town on it's ear and nothing is ever the same.

This movie is atmospheric and attentive to detail, from down-covered beds to the crunch of the snow to hanging fish and fresh-brewed coffee. All create a distinctive sense of time and place. And the magnificent, Icelandic light and austere terrain is breathtakingly beautiful.

A lot of the story is charming/funny, even quizzical, like the women's subdued reactions to catastrophic or unexpected news, or the grandfather's blythe acceptance of the wacky antics of his estrogen-laden household. Whether just Nordic temperament or great story telling, I'm not sure, but whatever it is, it's great fun. Imagine Alan Ball collabroating with Frank Capra after consulting with Ocsar Wilde, and you've got it. Highly recommended.",1151193600,13,1404,5.171806167400881
8046070,4,B0007989RU,"Much like that underrated early Nicole Kidman satire, The Seagull's Daughter is a funny, dark black comedy set in Iceland in the 1950s.  I was impressed by the strangely compelling cinematography, capturing Iceland in the various seasons, not so much beautiful as more other worldly.

The actors are well-cast, with a true star turn by the unpronounceable but stunningly beautiful star, and the precocious and charming young cousin.  The narrative includes peculiar and endearing townsfolk, love, lust, humor, intrigue, murder, and lots of dried fish.  It's a potent mix.",1147132800,6,571,5.382022471910112
