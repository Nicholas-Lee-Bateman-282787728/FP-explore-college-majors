8429042,5,B004GYKNGC,This is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time.,1481068800,,57,4.2727272727272725
8429043,1,B004GYKNGC,The people claiming to 'love' this movie must be paid to say so. This 'movie' is total garbage. It was promoted to my family and I as a religious movie. And we were assured it was for the entire family and did not contaain offensive langage. It is full of foul langage and sexual talk.,1410134400,,285,4.2
8429044,3,B004GYKNGC,"It's not a great movie.  It's not all that interesting and doesn't have a good storyline but it's not terrible.  It's not Good, but  just O.K.",1373241600,,142,4.384615384615385
8429045,4,B004GYKNGC,"This is a lovely movie.  It makes one believe that true, unselfish  love is possible after all.  I would recommend to all.",1333238400,,122,4.454545454545454
8429046,4,B004GYKNGC,"It's an independent film with budgetary constraints (by that should be expected with before purchasing). Outside of that, the underlining story of the film is very good and very much relatable to the concept of Christianity. The main character played by (Chyna Layne) really embodies the struggle that comes with accepting Christ into our lives. This film is say to its viewers... You're not just doing what you want to do, hanging with who you want to hang with, and living by certain scriptures that you want to live by. You're surrendering and humbling yourself before God; and changing your lifestyle. It's the best and most difficult decision you will ever make in your life. Some people will have a hard time understanding, accepting and even will condemn the new you that's in Christ!
The acting and the film alone is rated about a three (3), but the concept of the film I would rate a 4.5!",1333238400,,897,4.719745222929936
8429047,5,B004GYKNGC,I watched this with my man and it also helped us see what we were doing wrong in God's eyes! This film shows us what is right and what is wrong in building a relationship with others and with GOD. THIS IS A 10+ movie.,1318118400,3,217,3.8444444444444446
8429048,1,B004GYKNGC,"The movie rating of ""Not Rated"" is unfortunately for those who anticipate enjoying a presentation about love and relationship, that clean and free of the unecessary profanity.  An accurated rating or information of the content should have been presented for potential consumers viewers.  If you don't enjoy sifting through the disappointing proformance to get to the end, this isn't for you. This film earns a two thumbs down!!",1316217600,3,427,5.264705882352941
8429049,5,B004GYKNGC,"This movie was excellent, it changed my life. Thank you writer for inspiring me and giving me hope. I highly recommend this movie.",1303171200,6,130,4.695652173913044
