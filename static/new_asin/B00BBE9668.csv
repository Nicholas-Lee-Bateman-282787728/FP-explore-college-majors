5569941,5,B00BBE9668,"One thing I can say about Pureflix is they make action movies but still keep the church intact in the movie.  This was a very good movie with action, drama and a man trying to find himself in the midst of it.  I would advise to order part 1 first and be prepared because it set it up for a 3, but you will enjoy this movie if you know about the end times.",1372809600,,355,3.7837837837837838
5569942,5,B00BBE9668,I am happy that Christian movies like this are being made to Hollywood standards. These types of movies seemed like backyard movies in the past but now are top quality pictures I would recommend it to anyone. Also the theme with end time prophesy is what Christians like me believe will happen very soon. Great movie!,1372636800,12,317,4.678571428571429
5569943,2,B00BBE9668,If you did not see Mark 1 then its likely you will be confused for the first hour. Acting I found to be very wooden and I just could not get into this film. In fact I give up after an hour. Its heavily Christian based .,1371168000,,219,3.6808510638297873
5569944,3,B00BBE9668,"""The Mark 2: Redemption"" will be familiar to anyone who's seen other Christian end times movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Left-Behind/dp/B000XY6RA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Left Behind</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apocalypse/dp/B000056WRR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apocalypse</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moment-After/dp/B002UNXS68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moment After</a>"". The rapture has just taken place and we get to follow those left behind as the world unites under a charismatic new leader (Antichrist). The bad guys still want the microchip that's implanted in Craig Sheffer's arm. ""The Mark: Redemption"" is less preachy compared to some other films in this genre and can be enjoyed by non-Christian fans of apocalyptic action movies if they can overlook the occasional religious references. But be prepared for another open ending that lets a lot of loose ends untied to make room for one or more sequels.",1368576000,4,1069,7.56
5569945,5,B00BBE9668,This movie has you on the edge of your seat and the quality of the video is wonderful. I enjoyed the low cost and how fast the seller shipped them out. I highly recommend if you are into end time movies and the seller.,1364428800,3,218,3.977272727272727

5569970,5,B00BBE9668,"I love these thrillers and faith movie makers imaginings of what the very end times will be like. Incredible action, great,  at start,  reluctant hero for God,  all the evil One might expect from the Enemy,  who wants to put a chip in everyone.
For me it's entertainment; don't expect it to follow the details of the Bible. How could they do that?",1445731200,,347,4.4603174603174605
5569971,5,B00BBE9668,"Both of the Mark movies are excellent and do not scream Christian flik.  However, this movie has a to-be-continuted ending and they never made a Mark 3.  It is complete, as is the first one...but it is like watching a weekly series and having it cancelled before wrapping up the loose ends.  Too bad.  Well-acted by all the people.",1444089600,,331,4.559322033898305

5569985,2,B00BBE9668,"I tend to error on the side of the movie when it comes to these type of shows, but I just have to say that this rendition of the end times after the rapture was not very good.  To many flash backs. Actors going from one scene to another with very rough transition.  Story line choppy. I hate to say it but it seems like this movie was made just to make more money.  Don't they realize that if they make a good quality movie in this category, there are literally millions waiting to see it?  This movie really missed the ""Mark"" and I would be hard pressed to view sequels.",1421539200,,571,4.117117117117117

5569991,2,B00BBE9668,"I watched ""Mark"" before watching this one, and I ""enjoyed"" that more than I did this one, although perhaps ""enjoy"" is a bit strong. If you have not watched the first movie, stop reading - you will probably like it more than this one and I don't want to spoil any expectations. This movie takes up where the other left off. Chad and Dao land back in Thailand and Chad tries to remove the chip. I forget why, but Dao somehow remembers she has a sister who was kidnapped by mafia/Triad/evil asian gang guys, so Chad decides to help rescue her. This relates very little to the book of Revelations, other than to allow the backstories of the chip and the evil ""one world government"" to be introduced to us. I've watched other Revelation movie series and found them much better than this one. This seems more like someone tried to splice a low budget Hong Kong ""rescue the girl movie"" together with a story about the Antichrist.  I think the story could be much better told. After watching the first movie of this series I was not satisfied. I was even less satisfied with this one. Go watch Left Behind instead.",1415577600,,1106,4.475247524752476
