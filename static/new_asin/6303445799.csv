Carol guides one through every step of teh way and shows adaptations to keep you going even if it gets tough. Its blend of breathing, movement, stretching, meditation, & relaxation enable you to look great, feel great, & relax! It works on every aspect of your body, mind and being. The increase in your energy levels makes you feel better immediately after practicing just one of these exercises. It is non-stressful and I find it to help promote flexibility, cardio-vascular capability, weight & stress management, energy, serenity & personal power. Sut Nam!",996624000,7,686,4.773109243697479
