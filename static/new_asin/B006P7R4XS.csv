8502644,5,B006P7R4XS,"Another decent film from Sweden made in 2011. Starring Bill Skarsgrd, son of Stellan, brother of Alexander who does very well as the talented ice hockey player. Another fine performance comes from Alicia Vikander who really stands out in this.
With just under two hours of fine acting, the film is in Swedish with English subtitles.
Well worth a watch!",1351728000,2,352,4.883333333333334
