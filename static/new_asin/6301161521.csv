323950,1,6301161521,"Horrible, Low budget, Unfunny, Boring, Dated, Badly Filmed are a few adjectives you can use to describe this 80's stinker. I remember when Vestron Pictures threw in the towel, and this was one of the remaining movies on their slate to be released. It sat around for awhile before it eeked out onto VHS via IVE (later to become LIVE, Artisan and finally merging with Lionsgate), and died a sudden death. It never made a dvd debut, for a good reason.. Familiar cast just performing for the paycheck (Christopher McDonald especially).. Word to the wise: stream it be4 you buy it...",1366329600,,578,4.732673267326732
323951,4,6301161521,"This is an intense video series following Paramedics around on some of their more severe and complicated calls. If you can't deal with the sight of blood, broken bodies, and death this is NOT for you. This is a completely unedited video series. The video quality is moderate at best, and there's no narration so if you're not involved in the medical field and trying to figure out what exactly is going on you may be confused at times, but this is a 100% true life look into the world of Emergency Medical Services.",1357689600,3,515,4.48936170212766
323952,3,6301161521,"i guess i expected more medical information...not just someone showing at an accident scene.i  don't think I could recommend as a purchase video, would be better if you  could rent it from the library and return it!!  SORRY",1356912000,,223,4.815789473684211
323953,5,6301161521,"If you have never seen it, then your in for a real treat. It was back in the USA'S Up All Night days when I saw it as a kid. Glad to see it made it on dvd. It brings back my old memories from when I was a kid!",1347235200,,209,3.2
323954,5,6301161521,I was unable to watch it because my tape player decided it didn't want to work. lol  Condition of tape...case....tape is acceptable.  This movie I recommend will make yore belly ache from laughing so hard.,1346544000,,205,4.828571428571428
323955,4,6301161521,"This is a throwaway comedy, but it does feature arguably the hottest Playboy Playmate of the 80's, Karen Witter. In this film, she enjoys hiking up her skirt to show off her legs to any passing paramedic van. Yup, this girl's got it bad for paramedic guys and she loves standing out on the side of the road waiting to get picked up. And she does. She's a nymphomaniac with a strange fixation for the guys - or maybe even girls too?  - in uniform.
Apparently, she's got it so bad she doesn't discriminate and will take on white, black, old and young and plays the part with a lot of gusto. She even gives an elderly fella a heart attack after apparently riding him on his bed (we don't get to see this, sadly).
Anyway, there is actually a story - not involving a Playmate - but you will soon forget it. The film is mostly hi-jinx and a couple of young upstarts sticking it to 'the man.' but trust me, you'll only remember Karen's gorgeous face and those stunning legs!",1308614400,,967,4.313186813186813

323957,5,6301161521,"This is about two Paramedics who are not your usual First Aid responders, This comedy shows the lighter side of paramedics and the way they feeel a ambulance should be equipped, Also what happens when thier peers don not agree with their way of doing things. There is a situation in which they are assigned to area where there are street battles and a funny way the respond to it.",1268611200,,380,4.442857142857143

324072,1,6301161521,I love 70s and 80s silly movies but I remember going to bed and telling my wife...that was s t u p i d. I feel like it was trying for that wacky two dudes feel that just didn't deliver. The guy from Grease 2 seemd really out of place. I don't think paramedics live together like firemen. Maybe they did then. It did have the 80s tits you expect in this sort of film. That's what got it the one star.,1445558400,,399,3.8780487804878048
324073,5,6301161521,Great movie for those of us in the beginning of ems,1444176000,,51,3.727272727272727

324105,2,6301161521,Not great. Sound made it kind of difficult to understand. Some things were not clear. Some brief female nudity if that offends you. Some profane language. Horrible action scene. We really did not like it.,1439510400,,204,4.857142857142857

324111,5,6301161521,"I get the feeling these dvd's were made for people who enjoy the 'Faces of Death' or 'Traces of Death' videos. It has a shockumentary feel to it. It was also distributed by a low-budget horror film company, so it was made for people who want to see actual gore and death.

But nevermind that. Despite it's less than wholesome purposes, what these dvd's are best for is a preview for future emt's and paramedics in what they can expect on trauma calls. If an emt student can't stomach the scenes of severed limbs, crushed skulls, stabbings, gunshot wounds, and vomit, then the world of EMS is not for them.

This should be required viewing for all ems students.",1427760000,,660,4.53781512605042

324160,5,6301161521,"It's funny.  It's silly - rather stupid in some places.  It's your typical B-movie effort and I find it to be great fun in a completely irreverent way.  There is a bit of nudity - but personally a certain insurance company should take notes on this movie's portrayal of ""Mayhem.""  It is an ""Adult"" movie for adults who don't want to think or who want to have a really good laugh.  Check out the late Ray Walston (My Favorite Martian) in the opening - who knew?",1376956800,3,460,4.3023255813953485
