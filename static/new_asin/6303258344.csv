Well, this is the best bloody ribbing I have ever seen out of Hollywood - this film is the best bit of satire this side of the Discworld novels! While not so well known (indeed, I've only known one other person who has heard of it) as Spinal Tap, The Rutles succeeds brilliantly at the over-the-top humour which eluded the other film. This is THE best example of intelligent-satire-disguised-as-farce that has come along since ""Carry On Cleo."" If I could choose one film to represent the comedy genre, this would be it. I can but hope that the studio will one day see fit to re-release this comedic masterpiece on video, so a new generation will be able to experience this gem.",970531200,3,836,4.506578947368421

Featuring Eric Idle and Bill Murray, ""The Rutles"" is often sillier and more entertaining than ""This is Spinal Tap"". A must for Beatles fans that don't take themselves too seriously.

Neil Innes does John Lennon better than John Lennon. The songs  are outstanding and funny as hell. Two things are very impressive about  this film: first, the attention to the most minute details--gestures,  facial expressions, people in the background--it seems that every inch of  film was thoroughly thought out.

611446,5,6303258344,"""All You Need is Cash"" is a mockumentary dreamed up by Eric Idle and Neil Innes (often called ""the seventh Python"") about a '60s British rock band whose career eerily--and hilariously--parallel that of the Beatles.  While I am no Beatles expert I am conversant with their music, and the music parodies are exquisite.  I have watched this show with Beatles freaks who lovingly pointed out the little things only they would give a rip about.  In fact, you'd think, after working so hard to get it right, they would have pop-ups on pointing out these details, but alas!

While it looks like an all-star blending of Python and ""Saturday Night Live"" (the mockumentary derives from a short film cooked up by Idle and Innes in England and shown on ""SNL"" back in the 70s), the Americans (Dan Ackroyd, John Belushi, Bill Murray) look like what they were at the time . . . improv comedians shot to sudden fame on a live tv show.  Of their lot only Gilda Radner acquits herself particularly well.  As for other Pythons, only Michael Palin also puts in a welcome appearance.

The film also has insert snippets by the likes of Mick Jagger and Paul Simon, describing the Rutles.  Though Jagger occasionally looks a little too close to laughing, he does get the ultimate punch line, well worth waiting for.

And, most importantly, a cameo by George Harrison (in makeup) gives the whole piece a seal of authenticity.

The care and precision they put into the Rutles' look is remarkable, from their clothes and hair to their album covers, to the very way the old films are shot.  This work is clearly done with love for the Beatles, but not fawningly.  They are perfectly happy getting in their digs, but there's not really a nasty moment and the whole thing comes off as a joyful ride.  But it's spooky how Neil Innes seems to be channeling John Lennon, though Lennon was alive at the time.

The most fundamental thing about the show, however, as it was about the Beatles themselves, is the music.  If the music parodies had fallen flat the whole show would have been lost.  But Innes' parodies are all spot-on.  Not only does it sound amazingly like the Beatles sound you'd swear you had heard those tunes before), the lyrics are beautifully vapid and ridiculous.  You'll come right back to Amazon and order the albums.",1433894400,,2304,4.660891089108911
611447,5,6303258344,"Great movie about a parody of The Beatles. Even the songs are great mock up Beatle songs.
Eric Idle is great as the guy telling the story of The Rutles and also plays Paul McCartney.

The music is exceedingly well done by Neil Innes and Eric Idle wrote a great script.  The cameos by Mick Jagger and MANY other ""real celebritys"" also spice up the film about the ""Pre-Fab Four"" mightily.

Expect Monty Pythoneque humor (this was an Eric Idle project that started out as a Saturday Night Live skit; it proved so popular that the hobby horse ran off with its rider).  Fun and silly.

611518,5,6303258344,"This is THE must see parody of the Beatles story  an affectionate and clever look through their history using their alter-egos, the Rutles.  It takes them from their discovery in the Cavern by a manager fixated by their trousers, through to Let It Rot  a film, an album and a lawsuit.  Along the way, you can relive Rutlemania, enjoy the early success of, A Hard Days Rut, and Ouch! and the bands misuse of tea...  I note that other reviewers have mentioned you should dislike the Beatles to watch this, but it is certainly shown regularly at Beatles conventions and is quoted often by fans.  Neil Innes does a wonderful job with the music (the later Rutles album, Archeology, a pun on the Beatles Anthology, is also well worth a listen).  There are also lots of great members from both the Saturday Night Live teams of the time and the Pythons, plus obviously the Bonzos;  with Eric Idle not endearing himself to Paul McCartney, Neil Innes, Michael Palin,  Bill Murray, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd and even George Harrison in a cameo role.

There are lots of extras on this DVD, including a mini documentary on The Making of the Rutles, which shows how a musical clip for Rutland Weekend Television introduced the Rutles.  Later it was shown on Saturday Night Live as a joke, after an appeal for the Beatles to get back together (oddly enough, John Lennon and Paul McCartney once saw an appeal for a Beatles reunion while watching TV at the Dakota together and considered going to the studio, but sadly decided not to bother).  The public reaction to the Rutles clip led to All You Need is Cash  this full length documentary.  Other special features include Inside Shabby Road, the making of the music of the Rutles and some deleted scenes, featuring Mick Jagger and Paul Simon.  Both Jagger and Simon are very funny and it is worth watching for a revealing story about Paul Simon first meeting Dirk (or should that be Paul)  in London.

611572,5,6303258344,"it makes sense. we keep hearing Monty Python described as The Beatles of British comedy, and also that there was a certain camaraderie between the two. it's a bummer that it had to be the work of a solo Python with a cameo appearance by one other (Michael Palin) rather the collective Python, but on the whole it still seems only fitting.
possibly the most obvious thing to need to be said is that it is ""Rutt-les,"" not ""Root-les."" i always assumed it was the latter and still think that's the funnier option, but it turns out there's a logic to it. the concept began in Eric Idle's series RUTLAND WEEKEND TELEVISION. one of the running gags is that the series originated in Rutland, the very smallest, least influential province of the entire U.K. just about everything that happens in Rutland is so trademarked, usually with that ""Rut"" prefix, in the fruitless hope that one of these projects becomes famous and finally puts Rutland on the map.
the familiar story tells how the ""Prefab Four"" - Dirk, Nasty, Stig, & Barry - go from Liverpool to Hamburg to The Ed Sullivan Show and just about every point in between. geographically speaking, they go the same route as a certain John, Paul, George, & Ringo went in a parallel universe.
the most to be appreciated thing is that the comedy aims for the Beatles phenomenon, and even their personalities, but has proper respect for their music. the film understands that the achievement of The Beatles is such that they are sacred. after all, The Beatles did pretty much invent music!! (i don't usually believe in sacred cows, but every rule has an exception.)
so much so, in fact, that the music is actually pretty good. under the supervision of Python crony Neil Innes, The Rutles come off as a competent Beatles-inspired act, a' la Gerry & The Pacemakers or The Dave Clark Five. what's more, when it gets it's most Beatles-esque, it's so faithful it almost sounds like the real deal. take ""Love Life,"" the song Innes fashioned from ""All You Need Is Love."" it's refrain goes ""love is the meaning of life, life is the meaning of love""...and you actually find yourself wondering how John Lennon missed that mantra.
what's parodied is the hysteria surrounding Beatlemania and it's most ludicrous aftermaths. take Lennon's infamous ""more popular than Jesus"" debacle. here, Nasty gets in trouble for saying the band is ""bigger than God."" it turns out he actually said bigger than Rod, meaning a not yet famous Rod Stewart.
(from Eric Idle's commentary we get a not often told story of divine justice: it turns out the interview in question was months old at the time the controversy exploded. a radio station form the Deep South found the article and threw a hissy-fit solely to get themselves on the map. how the Almighty felt about The Beatles became clear not long after when a lightning bolt put the station out of business.)
there are numerous celebrity cameos, including one George Harrison as one of numerous interviewers. possibly because the film is co-produced by Lorne Michaels, several Saturday Night Live alumni - Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Al Franken - turn up. Murray ""The K,"" a disc jockey from the midwest who rode the crest of Beatlemania to the point that he dared to declare himself the 5th Beatle, is played by a certain Ghostbuster as ""Bill Murray The K.""
and there are some pretty good bits of Pythonism that don't necessarily relate to The Beatles. one running gag has Idle's interviewer character reporting as he walks down the street, and having to run when the truck carrying the camera speeds up for no apparent reason. the same interviewer states that, in order to explore the blues roots of rock, he's on his way to the banks of the Mississippi...and we find him in the city next to the sort of bank that involves money.
but still, it's the Beatles-related jibes we're here for. like when the Rutles' final tour culminates at ""Che Stadium, named for the reknown Cuban Gueriila leader...Che Stadium.""
i'm tempted to ask you to please give THE RUTLES a shot even if you're not a Beatles fan. but come to think of it, there's only one legitimate excuse for not being a Beatles fan, and that's being deaf.",1369526400,2,4187,4.729138166894665

611606,5,6303258344,"Yes, another review here, but so many others before me have done such a great job of outlining the film and its appeal that all I have to say is all you need IS cash.  I think that George Harrison had far more to do with this mocku-rockumentary than playing a reporter outside of the Apple building (laugh out loud funny, because people are ripping stuff off during the interview), because his sharp, wicked sense of humor has its thumbprints stamped indelibly all over it.  Niel Innes is by far and away the best Nasty (John) I've ever seen in either a straight or comic film, and his songs are actually very good parodies.  In fact, I really like ""I Think I'm in Luuuuv,"" a lot!  What else is very funny when they do a sendup of ""All You Need is Love,"" but change the lyrics to ""Love is the meaning of life; life is the meaning of love.""  I can still see my late brother laughing his kiester off to that bit.  My brother loved the Beatles, but he also had a sense of humor about them, and it's one thing I always credit him for when he got me into them as kids.  The thing that always makes me laugh the hardest is Riki Fataar--quite obviously of Eastern descent--playing George's character, because it's just too close to home.  Also love the Paul and Linda spoofs courtesy of Eric Idle and Bianca Jagger.  It really closely fits some of the comments John made about him as a songwriter.  Along with the Monty Python cast, we are treated with the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players, Paul Simon, and--best of all--a coolly funny Mick Jagger who is obviously enjoying himself.

If you  don't think this movie is funny or you think it's mean in any way, you're not getting it.  Whether you're a fan of this movie or prefer something a bit less dry to your taste with more Beatle humor, I would like to suggest a companion film made responsible by the SNL people called ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand.""

What is most interesting and insightful is Eric Idle's commentary throughout the movie.  He casts a picture of how it was made on a ""dime"" and my guess is that most of the players in this movie, did it for little or no money.

Idle mentions that the budget was $500,000 against what the BBC would have offered which was in the neighborhood of $30,000.

Given that the movie was made in 1978, it still comes across as ""fresh, irreverent and funny"" with Idle's puns, subtle British humor and ""running gags"" withstanding the test of time and not looking dated or cheesy.",1308873600,,738,4.6106870229007635

The legendary Rutles came out of Hamburg (via Rutland) and changed the face of rock music. George Harrison participates as a reporter interviewing an APPLE CORP. security officer (Michael Palin) while the entire contents of the building are pilfered in a parade of thieves and talent agents.

Remarkably good parodies of Beatles tracks were written by Neil Innes.

611609,5,6303258344,"OK, just think of the ""mathematical possibilties"" here:  this was produced by Lorne Michaels, the guy who produced (well...still does, actually) ""Saturday Night Live"" while it was still genuinely funny; it was written by Eric Idle, probably Monty Python's brightest light, who also ""co""-co-starred as the narrator and as (giggle) ""Dirk McQuickly,"" obvciously patterned after...well, I have to tell you ""who,"" you're beyond hope; Neil Innes, late of the brilliant ""Bonzo Doo Dah Dog Band"" played the Lennon character, & was also responsible for the DIRECT HIT-SPOT ON musical score, which serves both as a parody and a genuine memorial to the Beatles' music; former Beach Boy Rikki Fataar did the Harrison character & played his parts, musical and satirical, brilliantly and correctly; and actor/musician John Halsey was the ""Ringo,""perfect in size and talent.  And George Harrison gave ""the Rutles"" both his blessing, and he played a small cameo as an interviewer in the movie
To say that the music is satirical is to completely miss the point.  Innes, along with his own band, had served as the ""music director"" for Monty Python (that's him singing ""the mighty brave Sir Robin ran away/when danger reared its ugly head, he turned and tucked his tail and fled"" in ""Holy Grail,"" too), and his absorption of all FOUR Beatles musical talent & tastes made the music for the Rutles sound frightenly like an ""undiscovered Beatles album.""  My personal favorites are ""Good Times Roll"" with the lyirc, ""like ice in a drink/invisible ink/or dreams in the cold light of day/the children of rock and roll never grow old, they just fade away,"" ""Get Up and Go"" which, according to legend, kind of ""bugged"" John Lennon, due to its near direct ""reflection"" of ""Get Back.""  And the best song on the record/tape/cd, your call, is ""Piggy In The Middle.""  If you are making a ""personal tape"" or cd or something, and you sequence ""Piggy In The Middle"" immediately after ""I Am The Walrus,"" honestly, it sounds like the Beatles ""paused briefly,"" dropped the key of the song down two steps, and continued with a fourth & fifth verse.  Brilliant.  I had the opportunity to view this on/in its inital incarnation as a TV special with a Beatles fanatic.  My buddy had warned me that he'd ""86 th' TV if it got too stupid.""  Evidentally, it didn't...by the end of the viewing, we both had our acoustic guitars, and were madly trying to learn/remember the material.
Again, this isn't satire: it's more of a reverential ""thank you"" letter...  I gave it ""5 Stars"" because ""500 Stars"" wasn't an option.",1298246400,4,2569,4.8963133640553

611642,5,6303258344,"The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash is a hilarious spoof of The Beatles, Beatlemania and the documentaries that have been made about The Beatles. Beginning with the formation of The Rutles and following the fictional group all the way to their eventual breakup, we get scenes very similar to those so well known by Beatles fans--only here, with The Rutles practically impersonating The Beatles, there's a huge comic twist in every moment. The plot moves along at a good pace--you won't get bored and you won't feel any resentment at the fun being poked at The Beatles' real life story. This will be very funny for just about anyone; but if you're a Beatles fan who knows their history well you'll laugh out loud every step of the way! In this review I give you lots of information and it may seem as if I've given all the laughs away. Trust me--I didn't! You'll know when you watch this.

We meet, of course, a documentary style interviewer (Eric Idle) who also plays Dirk McQuickly, a member of The Rutles. He's the perfect candidate for the sloppy interviewer: a loser who never gets his story straight before reporting on it; and this leads to countless screwball comedy scenes including his interview with Ruttling Orange Peel (Bob Gibson), a man in New Orleans who claims to have ""invented"" The Rutles' sound. When Ruttling Orange Peel's wife jumps into the conversation, things heat up fast and it's extremely funny--and very well acted, too. It may be a short scene but it's incredibly funny.

Then, of course, there are The Rutles themselves. There's Dirk McQuickly (Eric Idle) who plays The Rutles' Paul McCartney, Barry Wom (John Halsey) who represents Ringo, Stig O'Hara (Ricky Fataar) who is their comic version of George Harrison and Ron Nasty (Neil Innes) who is their spoof of John Lennon. Their personalities--and even their voices--are remarkably like those of The Beatles, except for Stig, who plays ""the quiet Rutle);"" he has no lines in the film! This is clearly a reference to how George Harrison was always the one Beatle who preferred to remain relatively quiet and in the background. In addition, there's their ""discoverer"" Leggy Mountbatten (Terence Bayler) who got them their record deal and put them in suits; and look for a great performance by Henry Woolf as Arthur Sultan, The Surrey Mystic who tries to help them in the latter half of the 1960s.

The film uses archival footage of fans waiting for The Beatles at a New York City airport in February, 1964 and even a clip of Ed Sullivan as he announces ""The Rutles"" will be on his show that night. There's excellent brief cameo interviews with Mick Jagger, Paul Simon and Gilda Radner who plays the role of a woman stopped on the street to answer the interviewer's question about The Rutles. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Bianca Jagger and George Harrison himself also have cameo appearances. Excellent!

The DVD comes with deleted scenes and an optional commentary by director Eric Idle. There's a small feature of notes entitled ""Eric's Memoir"" and a still photo gallery.

The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash is excellent comedy for anyone--anyone--but if you know about The Beatles it's even funnier. Practically everything about their real life histories is spoofed and it's all done rather well. I highly recommend this DVD.",1246492800,2,3313,4.856637168141593
611643,5,6303258344,"What a great spoof of Beatlemania! This dvd is a must for any serious Beatles fan. Done in the style of monty Python, Eric Idle ,(who incidently plays Rutle Dirk McQuickly and the narrator), brilliantly captures the Beatle's story with a twist. The personalities of McCartney,(Dirk McQuickly), Lennon,(Ron Nasty), Harrison,(Stig O'Hara), and Starr, (Barrymore Womble...who changes his name to just Barry Wom...to save time), are perfectly mached. The music is first rate as well. They sound as if the pre-Fab Four could've written them. My favorite, Piggy In The Middle,is a spoof on I Am The Walrus, and is awesome. The film goes over every aspect of the Beatle's history including their infamous legal battles and the down spiral of their company Apple Corps. Beatle George makes a cameo appearance in the film as a reporter asking Python's Michael Palin about the thefts that happen daily  at ""Rutle Corps"". They even cover the 5th Rutle, Lepo and their manager Leggy Mountbatten (Epstein) and his antics concerning his associations with bull fighters. Interviews with Mick Jagger and Paul Simon about the Rutles is a nice touch giving the idea that the Rutles were an actual band.

There are a few funny gags, but not nearly enough funny, memorable lines.  The pros of this movie are: great cameos, catchy Beatles-eque songs, the depictions of Idle as Paul and Innes as Lennon, and some funny laughs with Idle as the narrator.  However, this movie is nowhere near as funny as Spinal Tap and doesn't even come close to Holy Grail.  Whereas those two movies had lines that were so memorable that they are still quoted today, The Rutles movie is missing that.  It doesn't have a very good flow to it and it feels choppy and there is too much time between each joke.

611698,5,6303258344,"Though the humor is perhaps not for everybody, most will love the wacky take-off on the Beatles legend.  Eric Idle, of Monty Python, a self-confessed Beatle fan, put this film together in the late 1970's as a mocu-mentary, and it may be one of the first ever made.  As such, it is the forefather of movies such as 'This is Spinal Tap' and 'Borat'.

What makes this movie so much fun is that it lambastes the Beatles from beginning to end without trashing them.  The movie takes a layer of patina off the Beatles' near-godlike status without tarnishing their legacy.  George Harrison liked the movie so much he has a part in it. Ringo liked most of it, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono, always enthusiastic about avante-guarde projects even at their own expense, were said to love it, even though Ono's character is supposedly the daughter of Adolf Hitler.  Of course, McCartney wasn't big on it, but he probably had a problem with his portrayal as overly-precious and doe-eyed.

Particularly hilarious are cameo appearances in mock interviews by Mick Jagger and Ron Wood of the Stones and Paul Simon.  Bill Murray is over-the-top funny as Murray the K. The out-takes of Mick Jaggar are hilarious, as he forgets where the fictional Rutles are from (Rutland) and makes some other unusable comments about the Rutles' sex lives.

The Rutles themselves look nothing like the Beatles, which is in itself funny.  In fact, one of them looks like he's of East Indian extraction (though maybe this was intentional as he plays the George-like character).  But the actor who plays the John Lennon character was also a top musician/composer, and he wrote songs that are so Beatle-esque that it's uncanny.  The songs are all take-offs on actual Beatles songs, but with slightly altered melodies and satirically-altered lyrics.

Filmed on location in England and the United States, the scenes take us through the career of the Rutles, from the jerky black and white images of the Ratskeller to the appearance on Ed Sullivan and on into their wierd psych stage.  Even the rooftop concert is parodied.  The locations, outfits, hairstyles, even the sounds are right-on.

The new DVD has the extra bonus of voice-over commentary by Eric Idle, out-takes, stills, Idle's take on the making of the film, and the viewer is even able to listen to each individual Rutles song singly.

Hugely enjoyable for any Beatles fan.  You do not want to leave this piece of Beatles satirical history out of your collection.

611699,2,6303258344,"I enjoy Monty Python and I am a big Beatles fan, so I was surprised I didn't like this movie.  Basically, there are only a few laughs, and they weren't specific to the Beatles so it could've been put in any mockumentary.  What also disappointed me was there was not much interaction of the Rutles - you don't get to see them talk to each other much, which could've provided many funny moments.  The song parodies weren't that funny, either.

What I did like was the visual aspects of the movie - they really did get the look of the Beatles throughout the years pretty accurately.  It was also good to see many of the original Saturday Night Live cast and they provided much of the few funny moments in the movie.

If you want to see a funny mockumentary, check out ""Spinal Tap"" and ""Fear of a Black Hat"".  Both movies have two necessary ingredients that this movie lacked: hilarious banter between the band members and funny lyrics in the songs.",1181952000,3,945,4.459302325581396

Neil Innes is outstanding as 'Nasty' (i.e. Lennon), and of course was also responsible for the wonderful spoof songs (""Let it Rot"" ""Ouch"" ""A Hard Days Rut"" etc""). Eric Idles presenter is a classic Python type character. The scene at the beginning where the presenter is being filmed from a moving vehicle which gets faster and faster is pure Python.

There are cameo roles for George Harrison, Mick Jagger and Paul Simon. George Harrison isn't playing himself, so you have to look a little harder to spot him.

Idle and Innes hit a grand slam here. Every scene is hilarious, nearly every line is a complete crack-up. The Beatles needed to be spoofed and they gave their blessing for this project. My guess is they even found it funny (though I doubt John liked seeing Nasty's wife portrayed as a Nazi).

The capper is the music. Some of the songs are just brilliant rip-offs, combining two or three elements of three Beatles songs. Example, ""Hold My Hand"" combines ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" the ""Eight Days a Week"" intro, and ""She Loves You."" Just priceless.

Like everything else Eric Idle has done, The Rutles is both clever and funny. Indeed, I found myself laughing out loud a couple of times--mostly over the one liners he inserted into his narration (as the mock reporter). The real problem with the film is that the parody is too close to the original. Showing the exact same type of circumstances, shots, and motifs as the Beatles undercuts its satiric worth. Placing their faces into well-known fab four scenarios is amusing at first but gets old after awhile. When something is practically a carbon copy of the original then it is no longer very satirical.

Mad Magazine parodies are usually meaner than this movie, which provides a very detailed overview of the Fab Four story, but it never really wants to hurt anyone's feelings. The costumes and sets are dead-on; anyone who knows the Batles story well will recognize the many details, right down to what the Beatles were wearing at the rooftop concert. But those involved here seem to like the Beatles too much to really go for satire heaven in the way Spinal Tap did. For example, wouldn't it be great to satirize the bitchy, exhausting Let It Be sessions? Couldn't they do more with the Yoko character than call her a Nazi? Couldn't more have been down with the Sgt. Pepper than call it Sgt. Rutters? Over all, the Rutles is full of lost opportunities. When John Belushi's Allen Klein character shows up, we expect him to do something really funny. But he doesn't. And after a minute or two, we never see him again. And I was surprised at how much Eric Idle's newsman commentator was in the movie. Wouldn't it have been better to avoid the narration entirely, and just let the Rutles be the Rutles?

611825,5,6303258344,"When I saw this movie on public television in 1978, I knew even then that this was the quintessential rock and roll parody.  It was released five years before ""This is Spinal Tap.""  If you follow along carefully, the historical (hysterical) references in this movie are dead-on accurate, although convuluted in the extreme of parody.  For example, the Beatles mystical trek to India was parodied as a Rutles trip to a small town in England by train, where they became involved with a mystic that looked like an undersized and undersexed accountant.  Brian Epstein's death was parodied as Leggy Mountbatten's (charmed by their trousers) tragic decision to move to Australia where he accepted a teaching position.  One would think that the Beatles documentary movie entitled ""The Compleat [sic!] Beatles,"" which almost mirrors ""The Rutles"" change by change, chronologically preceded The Rutles...but NO.  ""The Compleat Beatles followed ""The Rutles"" by several years, suggesting that ""The Rutles,"" despite its parody, actually served as an accurate chronogram of The Beatles.  Besides the dry and silly wit, the parody, and the ostensible historical accuracy, the music was spectacular!!  Neil Innes (aka Ron Nasty in the movie) created a CD worth of music in two weeks for that film...and it was, in my opinion, absolute genius.  Besides the steely integrity and high quality of the soundtrack, the music harked strongly back to the Beatles--but not so much via copying lyrics and riffs, but by melding styles and lyrical constructs that suggested rather than copied different Beatles songs to make unique music that stands on its own merit as Rutles music (although a precious few songs did sound very much like one particular Beatles song).  The lyrics to each song tended to parody a corresponding Beatles song, or even a set of several Beatles songs--lyrically and conceptually.  One has to be a Beatles freak to really understand that, but if one is, then one will get it.  The follow up CD was equally great...giving TWO great CDs worth of music to go along with the classic 1978 movie.  The fact that an array of stars were in this movie, to include original SNL greats, members of the Beatles and Rolling Stones, and more than one Monty Python member, was secondary to the parody itself.  The concepts tended to eccentricity and were oft times abstract, as exemplified by the parody of George Harrison's character being a super-reticent Indian fellow.  This was also noted by the Yoko Ono parody.  Her character was not Japanese, but instead--German, i.e., from another ""axis"" country, wearing a Gestapo uniform and being characterized as the daughter of the ""...man who invented World War II...""  All in all, ""The Rutles--All You Need is Cash"" is not the BEST move ever made, but it is up there and it is my FAVORITE movie due to the extreme parody, my appreciation of the Beatles, the superb cast, and the great accompanying music.  Although ""This is Spinal Tap"" is extraordinarily great in its own right--both the movie and the music...Rob Reiner, the creator of Spinal Tap, still should pay Eric Idle and Neil Innes royalties for peeling the crux of the ideas for ""Tap"" from The Rutles concept. For major fans of the Rutles, there is the 25th anniversary follow-up to ""All You Need Is Cash,"" a re-hash of the original with a few new wrinkles, to include an array of new interviews with an eclectic array of star entertainers that bolster the parody concept.  However, for the less enthusiastic fan of The Rutles, the follow-up movie would be nearly useless. It really is difficult for me to stop gushing over the greatness of The Rutles, but I guess this apotheosis for ""The Rutles-All You Need is Cash,"" has to end some time, and will do so right here, but not before I admit to the world that I, indeed, have participated in the ritual drinking of tea--and lots of it.",1140912000,8,3880,4.90519877675841

The commentary is much louder than many of the song sequences - notably Hold My Hand, Love Life, etc. And the special features are rubbish - unedited, clumbsy and unfunny outtakes from the Jagger/Simon interview sessions and Eric Idle's pointless 23 years on intro.

611828,5,6303258344,"From their early days in the Cavern club, to their sojurn in Hamburg, rise to fame in the British and American charts, and growth as artists in their own right, the Beatles will always make for a legend worth revisiting....um, but this review is about the Rutles, doppelgangers of the most extreme kind.

In 1978, when Spinal Tap was just a gleam in Rob Reiner's eye, Eric Idle introduced us to the ""Prefab Four"", a hilarious send-up of the original Fab Four. You don't have to be a diehard Beatlemaniac to get the jokes, but it helps. So do an intensive study of the Fab Four's history before you view this film. Or not, it's up to you.

We get Idle in multiple roles (as the narrator, a music critic, and ""Dirk"", the Paul variation), as well as Neil Innes channeling early John and his eccentricities, Ricky Fataar as an Indian (as in India) George, and John Halsey deadpanning it as Ringo. But apart from the obvious play on the Beatles' legend, there's more here than just simple parody. At its heart, ""All You Need is Cash"" is a scathing send-up of the sort of ""celebrity profiles"" that unfortunately still plague the nation's TV schedules today. If you've ever caught yourself watching ""E! True Hollywood Story: Pam Anderson"" and felt really, really dirty, this is the movie for you.

The Rutles travel down some familiar paths to fans of the Beatles: their discovery by a ""special"" manager, their signing away the rights to their songs, their rise to fame, and all the attendent madness that colored the Sixties. It doesn't take much of a leap to conclude that, in it's own way, the film captures the actual situation of the Beatles and their rise and fall perhaps more accurately than the overlong and overdone ""Anthology"" did some twenty years later (when the tragic passing of Lennon rendered such satire almost in bad taste).

In a pre-December 8, 1980 period, ""All You Need Is Cash"" spoofs each of the individual Beatles as well as their management team, their fans, their women, and their creative ruin (Apple Corps). Idle (who actually is a musician, despite the claims of one previous reviewer) wasn't able due to his overload of duties to contribute vocals for the Dirk song performances, and despite his obvious inability to even mime playing the bass he captures Paul's unique mixture of smarts and stupid ego in the performance. The other compelling figure is Innes' Nasty, who lives up to the name in his less-than-peaceful pronouncements (it's hard for some fans to imagine Lennon as a young, brash man, but that's what he was for the majority of his tenure in the group, and Innes channels him brilliantly). Fataar and Halsey also have memorable moments, but it's the Nasty-Dirk combination (as well as intercut interviews with others connected to the Rutles story) that carries the film.

In a triumph of loving satire and just plain fun, ""All You Need Is Cash"" is an essential companion piece to any Beatles video or documentary. In the Rutles, we find a band that's strangely familiar, yet not. And thank God for having them around to take a gentle beating to the legend. Sometimes you need to lampoon what you love to find the truth of the matter, and ""All You Need Is Cash"" is just about right.",1134086400,3,3221,4.703900709219858
611829,4,6303258344,"And in many ways it does. Neil Innes' songs are the clear highlight, and his portrayal of Ron Nasty - a wickedly absurdist version of John Lennon - makes it clear he was drastically underutilized in the Monty Python films. And there are some genuinely uncanny recreations of classic ""Beatle Moments"" that come perilously close to making you believe you're watching the film biography of an actual band.

But if there is one thing that stands out as both the film's primary asset and major detriment, it's Eric Idle. He can take the bows for tapping Neil Innes, for the many spot-on jibes at the whole Beatles legend, and getting the job done in the first place. However, he must also take a few brickbats for his overly broad twitting, as Dirk McQuickly, of Paul McCartney, which diminishes the uncanny genuineness that suffuses the rest of the production. As for his obvious incapacity on the bass (he's not even trying to pretend he's really playing), this is a jarring incongruity when he's shown playing with his ""bandmates"" - who are all portrayed by professional musicians, including Innes, and look it. The fact that he also shows up in other roles further compromises the realism.

Plainly, Idle should have stuck to playing the presenter/narrator/interviewer, a fine creation that could have only benefited from Idle's undivided attention as a performer. McQuickly would in turn have benefited from being given to, say, Ollie Halsall, who did McQuickly's singing (and only got a fleeting moment onscreen as ""5th Rutle"" Leppo).",1126483200,2,1535,4.9921875

I sat there just waiting for clever jokes but there were only a couple. The lyrics to the music are just too plain - really lacking jokes.

Maybe rent this one from the library, but you can save the money - you'll see my copy up on ebay soon.",1123545600,3,418,4.036144578313253
611831,5,6303258344,"Just to supply some missing facts. Contrary to what has been stated in other reviews, The Rutles did not originate on Saturday Night Live. The idea goes back to 1975, when Eric Idle dreamed up a TV company called ""Rutland Weekend Television"". Rutland is the smallest county in England, a mere 152 square miles, and  RWT was set up as a pretend rival to LWT, or London Weekend Televison, a commercial TV company founded by David Frost. Of course RWT wasn't a TV company at all, but a programme that Idle developed for the BBC. It aired in 1975-6 (George Harrison guested in one episode singing a Harrison-Idle composition).

In one sketch Neil Innes sings a mournful Beatles-style song, ""I Must Be in Love"", which gradually morphs into a black and white film of four lads singing in the style of A Hard Day's Night. Inevitably, they were called The Rutles. What else?

Later, when Idle hosted Saturday Night Live in America, he imported this sketch into one show, and it proved popular enough to be turned into a TV movie by NBC.

The original tapes of the Rutland Weekend Television series probably still exist, but so far the BBC hasn't chosen to put them out as DVDs. Why don't you email them and complain? They'll never do it unless they think there's a demand.

The Harrison connection really goes back much further. The first episodes of Monty Python aired in 1969 on the BBC's minority channel, BBC2. If I recall right, it went out at about 11 p.m. and was watched only by a few insomniacs like me. To begin with the viewing figures were small enough that the BBC might easily have cancelled the show before the first series was over, except that by that time its small audience had become quite fanatical. George Harrison was one of them. He actually phoned the BBC after the first episode to say that it was the best thing he'd ever seen. So it's possible that MP owes its survival to him.

Whatever - the Rutles movie has its faults. For one thing, I think a lot of the sketches were trimmed to fit when they made the movie, and the originals from which they were developed were funnier.  But it's great entertainment. And it's not a satire on the Beatles, but a tribute to them. You couldn't parody Beatles songs as well as they did unless you knew them inside out.

It's a steal. What else would you prefer to spend your money on?",1120694400,10,2341,4.504716981132075
611832,4,6303258344,"There's a problem with trying to spoof The Beatles. They had such a good sense of humor about themselves, and Beatlemania was intrinsically so ridiculous, that your efforts are bound to pale by comparison.

Neil Innes gives it a good shot anyway;  his song parodies are knowing, faithful, and affectionately funny.  Not only are the words, melodies and arrangements just right, but the recording studio plays the important role it did in the creation of the genuine articles:  historically correct musical instruments are manipulated with a large dollop of appreciation for producer George Martin's (and, for once, let's not forget Geoff Emerick's) role.

Innes' Ron Nasty is good work, too. His ""off-the-cuff"" comments to reporters are no less funny than those of his model, John Lennon. His close attention to Lennon's body language alone is good for some grins.

Eric ""Shamelessly Recycling My Past"" Idle has Paul McCartney's calf-eyed narcissism down pat. But his screenplay stumbles, flogging its very few, very slender jokes to death. It may be vaguely amusing that instead of getting into drugs the Rutles got into tea. Milk that notion a dozen times and it crosses the pleasure/pain divide.  His solo work more or less cinches it: Idle was the ""Ringo"" of Monty Python:  a craftsman surrounded by geniuses.

The most effective comedic sequences skewer The Beatles' film career (let us face it: The Beatles are remembered primarily for reasons other than acting skill). I assume co-director Gary Weis is responsible for these scenes, which reproduce the inane physical humor of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help!"" and the cheapo surrealism of ""Magical Mystery Tour"". To tell the truth, the only time this movie makes me laugh out loud is during the ""Ouch!"" clip (modeled on Richard Lester's ""Help!"", obviously). In four consecutive close-ups, filmed in slow motion, each of The Rutles gets hit on the head with an apple and mouths the word ""Ouch!"" The moment works probably because the actors seem to know they've got a good bit on their hands: the takes used show each one stifling the urge to crack up.

Or maybe getting hit on the head with an apple just really hurts.

This DVD earns an extra star for two of its bonus features: lengthy mock interviews in which Mick Jagger and Paul Simon improvise ""recollections"" of The Rutles based on their real-life experiences with The Beatles. Not much of this material made it into the feature, where it's drab anyway. Taken on its own, it's surprisingly entertaining (now here are some musicians who can act).  Between the two of them they stumble just once while inserting the appropriate Rutles-related names, places and album titles into their stories. We knew these guys were smart.",1118880000,4,2735,5.0

It really seems that the later Delilah Films production lifted from ""All You Need Is Cash"" wholesale to provide the structure for the real thing. Just watch both and you'll see what I mean.

What also shocked me when I watched the movie were the lengths that SNL went to exactly copy the Beatles gigs ( the ""I am the Walrus"" parody song looks like it was taken off Magical Mystery Tour. And of course there's the songs....""Piggy In the Middle"" and ""Ouch!"" are favorites of mine. Overall, great movie!",1111190400,2,715,5.163793103448276
611894,5,6303258344,"The stars and planets must have been aligned just right when Eric Idle and Neil Innes got together to make this brilliant movie.  With an in-depth knowledge of the Beatles, Idle (who plays the McCartney-esque character, Dirk) satires the history of the Fab Four.  Innes (Nasty, the John Lennon-like character) demonstrated an uncanny ability to write songs that both make fun of and pay tribute to the Beatles.  As mentioned by other reviewers, his songs stand alone admirably.  Without the combination of great story line and songs, the movie would have flopped.

This movie is not a ""mockumentary"", just as Neil Innes is not Weird Al Yankovic.  Despite the satire, there is an aura of respect for the Beatles that shines through.  The deleted scenes with Mick Jagger and Paul Simon illustrate this point; when you watch the interviews, although they say the word ""Rutles"", you know that they are thinking ""Beatles"".

There is a joyful vibe that permeates the entire film.  It looks like it was a joy to make.  And despite being made in 1978, it is as timeless as the Beatles themselves.  I highly recommend this movie to all Beatles fans.

One last thing:  For you older SNL fans, look for a cameo by a youthful Al Franken.",1108512000,2,1225,4.748815165876778

The song ""Goose Step Mama"" filmed in what's supposed to be The Cavern, is so funny it's worth it alone. You'd swear this was a real documentary of early 60s British Invasion bands. Even if you're not a Beatlemaniac, you'll still enjoy this, as the song parodies are brilliant, and watching Idle as an interviewer chasing the camera is priceless. Having a real Beatle, George, and others in cameos was great. This is simply the best parody of anything ever, makes This Is Spinal Tap look like a Fleischer cartoon.

611896,5,6303258344,"This is a warm, affectionate, funny tribute to a wonderful band who bear an uncanny resemblance to another famous 60's Liverpool band, the name of which I can't recall at the moment.

 I'd love to have seen some input by the other members of that other band, and a commentary by Neil Innes would have been great. Nevertheless, it is a very enjoyable film, and the commentary by Eric Idle adds a lot of background information on the making of it, as well as to the actual events that inspired it.

 However, my favourite feature is the Play Songs Only option, and it's the songs which really elevate this above other pop music parodies. Neil Innes is apparently an extremely gifted and underrated songwriter/performer, who, for the most part, managed to create songs in the various styles of Lennon and McCartney without actually copying them. For instance, the lyrics of his song Let's Be Natural echo the song Mother Nature's Son, whilst the guitar sounds are similar to the song Dear Prudence. Actually, all the songs stand up very well on their own merits, as well as heightening ones appreciation for the originals that inspired them.

The 'historical' segments work quite well within it's limited budget and look fairly authentic in spite of some obviously late 70's hairstyles and a parked VW Rabbit in one shot.

The recreations of some of That Other Band's films are spot on, especially the Tragical History Tour, which looks like it was lifted directly from Magical Mystery Tour, but is in fact much more fun to watch!

This is a fun picture throughout, and although the humour can at times seem a little strained, the songs will undoubtedly still be playing in your head long after you've stopped watching.",1105574400,7,1716,4.796610169491525
611897,4,6303258344,"Still surprisingly effective and the template for its far more popular and successful successor, ""This is Spinal Tap"", ""All You Need is Cash"" is its own magical mystery tour... a bizarre journey through the Beatles' story that twists & turns between the inspired and the downright silly but which, in the end, gets you there.

First off, Eric Idle's opening narration leaves you feeling that you're on some kind of second-rate Monty Python jaunt but, pretty soon thereafter, you hit the first of Neil Innes' brilliantly written and performed pastiches of Beatles' songs and things get much more impressive. And, from here on, it's a roller-coaster ride through some hilariously good and other, fairly weak re-workings of the Fab Four's career including brilliant send-ups of ""Magical Mystery Tour"", the Apple Corps debacle, ""Yellow Submarine"" and the ""Get Back"" rooftop session. But what makes this whole weird & wonderful ride hang together is the music... inspired, ""tongue in cheek"" gems that are so good that it's often difficult to remember they're not in fact original Beatles recordings. And, finally, the DVD's additional ""deleted scenes"" from the film's interviews with Mick Jagger & Paul Simon add fascinating insights into how The Beatles impacted on them while providing some wonderfully unintentional entertainment as they both struggle to remember that they should be talking about ""The Rutles"" rather than the real thing.

But what makes the film really interesting is that it's much closer to the reality of what actually went on than you may think. George Harrison's involvement as an actor in it, coupled with his close association with Eric Idle and the Monty Python team suggests that a great deal of ""insider knowledge"" was involved... how much remains a mystery in itself but the hand of someone ""in the know"" is most definitely there, making this flawed but highly entertaining film more than just an enjoyable spoof.",1103932800,5,1940,5.155555555555556

The Rutles, a mockumentary which takes a rather satiric look at the phenomenon known as the Beatles, is an excellent vehicle for Eric Idle with a stellar supporting cast from some of his Monty Python pals as well as cameso from the likes of John Belushi and Gilda Radner.  These two cameso alone make it worth the price of admission.

It is obvious that the Beatles are the object of Idle's scorn but it is by far one of the funniest parodies to come along in a long time.  I was thrilled to see it has been released on DVD and if you are a fan of wry, British, humor coming from the likes of Idle, you are definitely in for a treat!

His little bits, which perfectly parody the Beatles that Idle so adored, fit seamlessly into Innes' fantastic songs. Idle comments that Innes' songs added another dimension to the Beatles songs they're based off of rather than becoming shameless parodies (are you listening Weird Al?) and he is quite right.
The film contains moments of comic genius, but mind you they're mostly subtle moments of comic genius. The people I've run into that didn't think this film is funny at all tend to like the blatant, loud, American-style humor. So be patient with the humor, enjoy the music and discover the true genius of the Rutles.

IT is the ultimate parody of Beatlemania. The Rutles was initially released as a made for NBC TV film in 1978. Created by the Saturday Night Live team and Eric Idle (Monty Python), it has a distinct British flavor and Pythonesque sense of humor. It is basically a ""mockumentary"".  Here's an example: after ""Nasty"" (John Lennon) proclaims the Rutles are bigger than God, the public is outraged, and start burning Rutle records. Record sales soared, people were buying them just to burn them! It turns out that the journalist who interviewed Nasty was hard of hearing. Nasty said the Rutles were bigger than ""Rod"" (Stewart)!!
The mockumentary covers the entire Beatle phenomenon up to their break-up.
The film gained more fans on video, and is now a bonafide cult classic.  The music by Neil Innes (who wrote songs for Python) is superb, and he is perfect as John Lennon. Eric Idle plays McCartney and directs. The songs parodies are also on cd. They are amazingly Beatle-like.
The film is never critical, but made as a tribute with large doses of humor. The harsh aspects of Beatlemania are lightened.  For example, Brian Epstein does not die in Rutleland, he accepts a teaching post in Australia.
Even if you are not a Beatle fan, this film is still a lot of fun, although you may not get all of the references.",1072742400,23,1419,4.713709677419355

The problem is that the film is just not as funny as it wants to be. So, you feel like all the cues are there for you to laugh: there's Eric Idle's goofy face, there's the pause before the punchline, there's the inevitable joke. But the clever touches are somehow only halfway clever enough, so there's very little oomph to the laugh.  The overall concept is fine; one can only wish that Idle had put the script and gags through a couple more drafts to get the most out of his material.
So, my advice, for what it's worth, is to buy the first Rutles CD (which is wonderful).  But rent the film before you buy it.

1 Love The Beatles. Or, at least have enough knowledge and understanding of Beatle history to appreciate the humor in this clever ""mockumentary"".
The Rutles, or the Pre-Fab Four as they are called, are four lads from Liverpool, England, who make it big, not because of any musical talent, but because of their tight-fitting pants. Rutlemania is born! They are introduced by Ed Sullivan himself (cleverly dubbing the word ""Rutles"" in place of ""Beatles""). The Rutles soon conquer the world! They make hit films like ""Hard Days Rut"", ""Ouch!"". But when Nasty (the Lennon-esq member of The Rutles) makes his coment about being ""bigger than God"" , things soon fall apart for The Rutles. People burn their Rutles records, and record sales go up as people buy records to burn them.
Then they make films such as ""Tragical History Tour"", and ""Yellow Submarine Sandwich""(excellent animation, by the way. Looks extremely similar to the actual ""Yellow Subarine"" film animation!)
The George Harrison-esq member is believed to be dead (considered to be the ""quiet one"" he hasn't spoken since 1966, so people assumed he was dead, and that The Rutles had gotten a wax-dummy replacement) because he is not wearing any pants on the cover of the ""Abby Road""-like album; and on ""Sgt. Ruters Only Darts Club Band"", he is leaning a certain way.
Special cameo apperences include Mick Jagger, Paul Simon, George Harrison (keep your eyes open for him. I almost missed him. He plays an interviewer), Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, and others.
And, 2, if you enjoy British humor, like Monty Python's Flying Circus. Eric Idle, of Monty Python fame, created the Rutles. He plays a few characters in the film, such as the McCartney-esq Rutle, Dirk McQuickly, as well as the documentary interviewer. It is funny when, as the interviewer, he is standing there talking, and the camera moves away, and he has to run to chase after it.
Also, this DVD offers, as one of the special features, Eric Idles memoir of making The Rutles; it is good reading. I found out former Beatle, George Harrison, supported Eric Idle all the way, and encouraged him to make the movie. I learned all four Beatles had enjoyed watching The Rutles movie; Especially John and Ringo. Yoko Ono has a good enough sense of humor, as well. She didn't seem to mind being portrayed in the film as ""Hitler's daughter""!
So...Love and appreciate The Beatles? love to laugh? are in the mood for good humor? Then buy The Rutles now. (Come on, you know you want to)",1044662400,2,2551,4.786848072562358
611960,5,6303258344,"The Rutles stands as perhaps the greatest Beatles' tribute ever made.  Every single time I watch it, I marvel at the amount of detail that went into crafting this spoof of the Beatles' history.
In a way, this film is as essential to any Beatles collection as the Anthology series.  Eric Idle conceived and wrote the film, and while he sends up the Beatles in a sometimes very biting way, he obviously loves the group very much.  This is a consistently hilarious film, though the more you know about The Beatles, the more you will appreciate it.  But even if you have a more casual interest in the Beatles and the music of the '60s, there is much to enjoy, including cameos from Mick Jagger, Paul Simon...and even the late great George Harrison himself.
Neil Innes wrote the songs of The Rutles, and they are spot-on parodies of the many styles of the Beatles music.  In fact, they are so well written and performed, some of the tunes manage to stand on their own (some are more tied to actual Beatles' songs than others).
What if you aren't a big Beatles fan?  Will you still enjoy this?  If you're a Python fan, the chances are you will.  If you're a fan of early Saturday Night Live, this is also a must-see.  Lorne Michaels produced the film and it features priceless cameos from Bill Murray, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and Gilda Radner.
The dvd itself presents the movie as good as it probably can look.  It was shot on 16mm (with some ""tv footage"" shot on video), and it is meant to look like a documentary.  There are a handful of special features, as well.  Best of the bunch is an informative commentary track from Eric Idle.  The deleted scenes, photo gallery, and new (brief) introduction by Idle are all nice to have.
On the commentary, Idle talks about how much the real Beatles loved this film.  He tells a nice story about visiting George and Ringo, and how they sang ""Ouch!"" to him, which was the Rutles answer to ""Help!""  Idle also refers to times when George would (intentionally) reference Rutles-history as if it were actual Beatles-history.  As Idle puts it:  ""You can't quite tell where the legend ends, and the comedy takes over.""",1044316800,4,2152,4.5625

611962,5,6303258344,"Monty Python evilly conspired to wreck yet another genre: Music.  They wrecked the pursuit of the Holy Grail, the Meaning of Life, and a lot more.  This time, they set their crosshairs on The Beatles and let her rip.  The result was one of the funniest films of all time.
The Beatles didn't sue too harshly, well, if only because squeezing Monty Python for money and an onion for blood, only delivers mashed onions.  George Harrison (a former Beatle) helped Monty Python do their work.  They forged an alliance with Saturday Night Live and ran true to course.  The result is an irreverent romp all over the Sixties, music genre, and a whole lot more.
The Rutles were Dirk McQuickley, Barry Wom, Nasty, and Stig O'Hara.  They pan, in order, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, John Lennon, and George Harrisson, with the occasional jape at Beatles' Producer, Brian Epstein.
The Rutles saga starts in a vacant lot near skid row.  Commentator Eric Idle points to a spot on the ground,and says, ""This is where Stig and Barry bumped into each other.  Stig was only an amateur drinker, and Nasty offered to help him get up . . ..""  The camera pans right, and the commentator follows at a sprint.  ""The Rutles legacy began a few feet back there . . ..""  It did no good, the camera truck saw their chance to leave him and took it.  In another scene, they leave him in the middle of the street, chasing he van.  Another scene, Idle puns, in a cellar full of rats, and the crew turn out the lights.  Later, the crew drives over the Commentator.  The next scene, he is in the hospital, bandaged head to toe.  There are other subplots, all wildly funny.  One scene shows the Producer cowering in a bathtub, wearing swimming trunks at his wife's demand, so that he would not look down on the unemployed.
It is cheeky, irreverent, wildly funny, and believe it or not, you could show it to the preacher's wife and not give too much offense.  Well, maybe not to the point of excommunication: just a Papal interdiction or the rack or sentenced to life as a movie reviewer or something nasty.
The movie goes on like that one madcap spoof and one-liner after another that is guaranteed to send you out of your chair to the floor laughing so hard it hurts.  I recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good hard laugh at something that is clean, acceptable in the company of puritans and deviates like me, and just plain wildly funny.

612023,5,6303258344,"What's genius about the Rutles is this: Watch the Rutles, and then watch one of the Beatles documentaries (the Compleat Beatles, etc) - then note that the Rutles was made PRIOR to any of the decent Beatles documentaries, yet looks like a parody of the real deal.
This mockumentary pre-dates Spinal Tap, and takes a different approach - by chronicalling supposed ""source"" material - news reels, press conferences, etc. The approach works well for Eric Idle, and the music by Neil Innes is perfect - slightly silly, but more Beatles than Weird Al.
The knowledge of the Beatles - their personal history, their tv appearances, their scandals, etc - is so well known by Idle -  makes this mockumentary spot-on accurate, and all the more funny.
The DVD is worth having. If you have this on VHS, you've got a pretty lousy transfer from the original 16mm film. The film was restored and retransfered for DVD, and it casts the movie in a whole new light of clarity.
The bonus material isn't much to write home (or Amazon) about, but it's nice to have the stuff added on such a low priced DVD.",1023148800,11,1083,4.61139896373057

Instead of just taking the lyrics to the songs and slightly altering them, the music itself was altered as well.  The end result is a song parody which is just as enjoyable to listen to as the original.
I loved the DVD so much that I watched it 3 times on the day that I got it!  ......

612026,5,6303258344,"This is an example of that most unusual art forms : an affectonate parady.  Eric Idol had followed up his success as part of the Monty Python team with the TV series ""Rutland Weekend Television"" from that came a guest spot on ""Saturday Night Live"" where the idea for the Rutles was born.
Idol, as usual, plays a slightly put-upon television journalist who tries to re-trace the steps of the pre-fab-four and augments the story with archive clips of the band performing their hit songs.  The songs, which are reminicent the real thing, were written and performed by Niel Innis who had his own TV series in the U.K. the early 80's.
Considering the limited budget, or even not considering it, the ""archive"" clips look great and even more are very funny. The annimation on the""Yellow Submarine Sandwitch"" sequence is particularly well done.
Some of the sadder aspects of the Beatles story are glossed over or ignored like the Brien Epstien character's homosexuality and his eventual demise; but you can't realy blame the makers for that and of course ""All You Need Is Cash"" was made before John Lennon's murder so the ""Nasty"" character is less sympathetic than you might expect as he kicks one of the crew off the Rutle Corps roof at the start of the ""Get Up And Go"" sequence.
The guest apperances by among others Paul Simon, Mick Jagger and even George Harrison perpetuate the joke but ultimatley the joke is not on the Rutles but on the media hysteria that surrounds them.
Rhino have done a great job restoring this and have gone to great lengths to make sure even the FBI warning at the start is funny.  A must-have for any Beatles fan with a sense of humour.",1008806400,7,1658,4.63265306122449

612032,5,6303258344,"Upon the break-up of the TV Pythons, John Cleese studied the fundamentals of French and Italian farce in order to create the outstanding 'Fawlty Towers', Michael Palin and Terry Jones went back to boyhood adventure stories to devise the brilliant 'Ripping Yarn' parodies, and Eric Idle teamed up with ex-Bonzo Neil Innes to write the 'Rutland Weekend Television' (RWT) series for BBC2.  Borrowing most of its name from a genuine TV station (London Weekend Television), RWT anticipated the unstoppable rise of regional television produced on a shoestring.  (Several comic teams have copied the idea since, for instance the Deayton/Perkins/Pope-created 'KY-TV'.)  I saw many of the episodes of RWT, but it's no coincidence that they were rarely (if ever) repeated and that the series has never made it to video.  The sketch failure rate was very high on RWT, far higher than even late Python episodes.  We watched RWT less for the jokes and more for the anarchy.  The Rutles started off as short spoof pop video for one episode and got expanded into this 70-minute mini-film documentary.
'The Rutles' was an exception to the rule that a single sketch can't be built up into a full series or film.  It worked brilliantly.  Until buying this DVD, I had only seen the film once -- on its original UK broadcast at 8.45 on 27th March 1978 -- but I was instantly overcome with Rutlemania, buying the LP and writing off to WEA for any posters or Rutle merchandise they could send me.
I'm sure the Rutles documentary helped to define the classic visual moments in the Beatles' only story.  George Harrison was closely involved in the project, so it had the stamp of approval of at least 25% of the original Fab Four.  According to Eric's commentary on the DVD, both Ringo and John also enjoyed it.  I suspect that Paul McCartney had more problems with it; Eric's imitation of Paul's wide-eyed innocence is stunningly accurate, and the scene in which Dirk is struggling to compose a nursery-rhyme-like song for his nuptials with Bianca Jagger is an incisive and wicked depiction!
The jokes, such as they are, have not stood the test of time.  From this evidence, Eric comes across as better at networking than at humorous scriptwriting.  As is obvious from the stars who appear in the film and Eric's constant name-dropping on the DVD commentary, he has known many of the top stars in the pop business.  The improvisational star of the video is really Mick Jagger, lying through his teeth, and as Eric cleverly points out, giving away far too much about his true feelings towards the Beatles and women.  The other star is Neil Innes, for his song-writing and his Lennon impersonation.
One of the best decisions that Idle took for the creation of this film was to play the pop videos pretty well straight, without trying to insert many jokes into the performance.  Most of the opportunities for visual humour within a mimed pop video tend to be fairly Chaplinesque knockabout and don't last well for the tenth viewing.  (Not that any of us expected in those pre-video days to be able to see programmes multiple times.)  In those videos, Idle reveals himself as arch-copyist: so long as you change just a few actions or expressions, then copying the original Beatles films as closely as possible is the best way to let the humour in Innes' songs to shine through.  Innes revealed in a radio interview at the time that his composing strategy was to take the original Lennon/McCartney tune and change as few notes as he could get away with, without being prosecuted for copyright theft.  (No doubt Harrison, with his subsequent experience of being sued for stealing the tune of the Chiffons' 'He's So Fine' for 'My Sweet Lord', could have helped him here!)
Eric reveals that he's writing a new Rutles documentary, though it's hard to believe it will be as good as this one.  Presumably the one-legged Leggy Mountbatten returns to Britain in response to the teacher shortage, announces that he is no longer quite the man he once was, and gets engaged to Dirk.  Stig sits at home in his fortress, having become a vigilante.  When he's not waiting with his nuclear arsenal for the next attempted break-in, he's busy inventing new media formats (beyond CD and DVD) to enable yet more re-releases of Rutles' material.  Nasty can only be contacted via e-mail; he runs an Internet Web site which dispenses multi-faith blessings and online tea at reasonably exorbitant prices.  And Barry has sold his chain of hair salons to present a weekly radio show for the over-60s; he also does the voice-over for a series of sex education videos.
The problem is that too much tragedy has crept into the Beatles' lives in the past quarter-century for it to be made fun of.  Awareness of personal tragedy may be the key reason why many comedians who hit the big time in their 20s gradually become less funny as they get older and their loved ones die.
But 'All You Need is Cash' is Idle at his post-Python zenith, not quite in his 20s, but close enough.  I much appreciate the arrival of this film on DVD and can only lament the fact that I had to visit the US to buy it.  This is a region-1 only DVD, so  those of us in region-X will need to run it on our PCs or multi-region players.",998092800,6,5250,4.707103825136612

This 70-minute ""semi-feature"" film conceived by ex-Python Eric Idle who plays the Paul McCartney-esque character Dirk McQuickly was produced by Lorne Michaels of SNL and includes various cameos from the classic SNL cast (Bill Murray, John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd, Gilda Radner) as well as cameos from Mick Jagger, Ron Wood, Paul Simon, ex-Python Michael Palin and even George Harrison himself as an interviewer! Neil Innes (who plays the John Lennon character Ron Nasty -- quite brilliantly I might add) also contributes some of the greatest Beatles song parodies imaginable -- they are both hilarious and actually quite clever in that they still manage to stand on their own as original songs. Anyone who has seen the later real documentary, THE COMPLEAT BEATLES (or even the ANTHOLOGY), will have to see this to believe it -- the major events of The Beatles twisted around and reapplied to The Rutles! The mock performances will have Beatles fans howling with laughter.

612096,5,6303258344,"I got the title of these remarks from a 1990 review of the CD.  The author wrote that, despite its similarities to ""The Compleat Beatles,"" a serious documentary, ""The Rutles"" was actually released first.  True or not, this is a marvelous film in its seamless combination of humor and music (sometimes humorous music).  The group is discovered by Stiggy Mountbatten.  After he dies, a reporter asks the mother what first attracted him to the group.  ""I think it was the tight pants,"" she replies.  The music is excellent and, as in ""This is Spinal Tap,"" holds up on its own.  How much like the Beatles it sounds can be illustrated by the following anecdote:  During the ""hourglass segment"" (news clips) of the British Invasion installment of Peter Noone's old VH-1 show ""My Generation,"" the Beatles' appearance at Shea Stadium is accompanied by a Rutles tune.  Was it an inside joke?  Did a producer goof up?  The song was half over before my wife and I figured out why it seemed out of place to us.  [""My gosh, it's not the Beatles, it's the Rutles.""]  Since the VHS is unavailable at present, I strongly urge you to order the CD soundtrack of the film.  I also recommend highly a second CD,  released just after the Beatles issued ""Anthology.""  The Rutles album is title ""Archeaology,"" and the songs on it are a more serious, musically brilliant, tribute to the Fab Four from Rutland's Pre-Fab Four.

For those reviewers arguing about whether this is a SNL or Python production here's the Word from Mr Innes Himself (I went to see his one man show last night)
The Rutles started of as a small item in the Sketch Programme ""Rutland Weekend Television"" the episode was first aired in the UK on 12 November, 1976  (BTW Rutland IS a real geographical region in the UK not made up as one reviewer claims)
Rutland weekend television was written by Eric Idle with music provided by Neil innes. Innes and Idle had met working on a children's TV programme  called ""do not adjust your Set"" (along with soon to be Pythons Idle, Gilliam, and Jones) that ran from 1967-69 on ITV in the UK.  In October 2, 1976 after Python had spread across America, Eric Idle was invited to be the host of a Saturday Night Live show. Aired on that show was the Rutles sketch from ""Rutland weekend television""  (actually ahead of it's UK airing) this was included as part of a long running spoof attempt by SNL to get the Beatles back together. It got a massive viewer response which prompted SNL to put up the money for a full length film based on it. This was written by Idle with music from Innes (None of the other Pythons were involved) and had cameos from SNL regulars, some Pythons, pop stars and George Harrison himself.
""The Rutles - All you need is cash"" was first aired on NBC-TV in 1978
As it was produced by SNL and had no other input from the other Pythons, other than a few cameo appearances, it cannot be considered a Monty Python production.",973728000,8,1776,4.452307692307692

612100,5,6303258344,"There's a chap who has written a review of this DVD claiming that the primary contribution to the Rutles was made by the SNL folks, rather than the Python guys, because there are more of them. This is innaccurate: The Rutles began as a spoof in the UK on a London Weekend Television (LWT) show called Rutland Weekend Television, featuring programmes on a fictional regional station (set in a fictional region of Britain!). It was when The Rutles proved a hit in a guest slot on SNL that Michaels agreed to finance the film, but it could not have been done without the creative force: Eric Idle and Neil Innes. True, Idle was an ex-Python, but he was the only one involved in The Rutles (no Chapman, Cleese, Gilliam, Jones or Palin - the latter merely makes a cameo in the film).
  Those SNL guys appear in The Rutles, but this wasn't an improvised affair like Spinal Tap.  It was carefully scripted by Idle, while it is Innes songs (Idle didn't write them and mimes as Dirk McQuigly!) that really make the idea work. They are therefore the primary contributors.
  Oh, by the way:  The Rutles is quite brilliant.",972000000,,1111,4.557788944723618

The original score is brilliantly hilarious... as well as cunningly crafted to sound convincingly like the fab four themselves.

The only necessary advice I'd give to someone who has never seen this film, or who doesn't know much about the Beatles' backstory (shame on you) is that I highly recommend that you first watch the complete Beatles Anthology (documentary), listen to all their greatest hits (over and over again), AND check out some Monty Python films to boot (it's made by som Python members).",1522368000,,542,5.078651685393258
