6243113,4,B00HXXG48E,"It seems that the theme of ""Bayou Blue"" (BB) might be something like, ""Why doesn't anybody care about these crimes, anyways?""  Well, the answer is obvious.

Americans love serial killers -- not the killers themselves usually, but the stories -- which was probably started by the movie ""Silence of the Lambs.""  But Americans only really care in the following scenario:  the killer is a man, and the victims are women.  (Usually the women must be good looking as well, but now I digress.)  There are a lot of reasons why, and I have my own theories.  Not that I'm much interested in writing about those theories.  And not that you're much interested in reading them.

And this story IS about a male serial killer, but it is believed that all of his victims were male as well, so Americans would be only half-interested.  After all,  Ronald Dominique is gay, and it is usually the case that a serial killer kills people in the sex in which he or she is sexually interested.  So this killer didn't stray from that ""rule.""  It is also true that some of his victims were homeless -- not all of them, as the mother of one of the victims reminds us in the documentary -- and some of his victims were gay -- not all of them once again, as another relative at least alludes to at one point -- and some of them were addicted to drugs.  It is probably the case that a majority of Americans consider these types of people the ""throwaways of the throwaways"" whether you like it or not.  And whether those people who think this way will admit it or not.

It is interesting that Mr. Dominique is white, while most of his victims are black.  It is usually the case that most serial killers prefer not to cross racial boundaries, but in this sense, he didn't play by the ""rules.""  This wasn't discussed as much as I would have liked in BB, at least in the more general sense.  Why did he prefer black men?  You tell me, after viewing; I don't think that you'll learn why either, even though quite a bit of the police interview with him is featured.  Perhaps this was edited out for Political Correctness reasons?

Some of the victims families here complain about how long it took to catch Mr. Dominique, but I've always thought that catching a serial killer is like finding a needle in a haystack -- WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW THE LOCATION OF THE HAYSTACK!  (Sorry about the uppercase and the exclamation point; I hate them too.  But I really needed to highlight this point.)  Consider this killer.  He is not the biggest guy, so let's call him the ""needle;"" and he killed over several cities and parishes, so let's call them the ""haystacks.""  So, if and when detectives catch one of these killers, those detectives should be congratulated really, in my opinion, no matter how long it takes.

But this goes deeper than that.  Society is to blame for many serial killers roaming free for so long to some extent.  Social mores and social judgment makes catching serial killers difficult, as victims in these scenarios don't want to come forward, for fear of ridicule.  It is quite often the case that ""one living victim"" helps crack a case, and that happened here.  (This also held true in the Ted Bundy case, or the Robert Hansen case, etc.)  I believe a gentleman named ""Ricky"" -- who is featured midstream -- was willing to talk with the police which gave them an initial prime suspect.  So, if anyone wants to throw some beads and blow a few horns to anyone as a token of appreciation, it should be Ricky.

There are some issues with this documentary, as there always are.  First of all, I think that it could use more closed captioning.  Sorry, but I could barely understand quite a few of the players here.  Also, some of the editing could be better; an idea will pop up at one point, then the story goes in another direction, and then the story returns to a previous point, without a smooth transition.  And this happens several times.  Furthermore, there is a mother-daughter (?) interview team, where it seems that only the mother of a victim could get in a word edgewise, and I would like to hear the opinion of the sister character a bit more.  But overall, the story still held my interest, nonetheless.

Well, perhaps it is true that people don't much care about this story.  After all, it just released in the last year, and it is already free for Amazon Prime members.  And I believe that I'm only the fifth person to write a review.  If someone were to exclaim, ""Really?  There is someone out there who is interested in this story!"" your response might be, ""Who Dat?!?""  Well, I might say, ""I am!  Dat who!""",1424131200,2,4596,4.493961352657005
6243114,5,B00HXXG48E,"Don't expect the typical crime documentary here. There isn't a gritty soundtrack, or graphic crime scene images, and there are very few lurid details of Ronald Dominique's crimes. Bayou Blue is a somber, thoughtful film, one that relies on an attentive viewer who is willing to have a little patience as the events are told through law enforcement or bereaved, often baffled, relatives.

There is a story here, but it is not the story of a serial killer. At its heart, this movie is an exploration of the almost universal disinterest in the murders and rape of 23 men. It offers suggestions: the victims being ""street people"", the lack of interest in the impoverished area of Louisiana where the murders took place, the homosexual nature of the crimes, it all adds up to a story that apparently the news felt wasn't of interest, or possibly just felt too squeamish about to report on.

I've watched hundreds of hours of crime documentaries and forensic television shows and I've often seen the same cases explored again and again, yet this is the first time I've heard of Ronald Dominique's crimes.

The man on the cover of this DVD is the sole surviving victim. That choice should tell you quite a bit about the film, actually. Ronald Dominique is seen only once, and he scuttles at the edges of the film like a cockroach. You see the results of his evil, but are never invited to be titillated by the graphic details or watch weeping relatives relive their pain.

 The end of the film is staggering. It quietly and simply pairs the audio from Dominique's taped confession, as video lingers over a large poster of the victims, showing each man's face, his name, his age. It is appallingly heartbreaking and restrained.",1423699200,28,1719,4.75503355704698
6243115,3,B00HXXG48E,"The direction of this documentary was very poor. There was no history of the killings or the killer or even the victims. There were moments during the interviews with the family that were unprofessional and should have been edited out. There was no narration about what we were watching and it seems to just start. There was no mention of the families (the few that were interviewed) taking issue against their loved ones being homosexual. No pictures of the bodies (distorted or otherwise) and no explanation of just how the bodies were discovered. There were 23 murders and one known survivor. And oh the survivor; couldn't his interview have taken place at a different time or day? Couldn't they have displayed him in a better light? The sister of one of the victims got on my nerves. Her talking over her mother was annoying and most of what she had to say was nothing necessary information. I don't know, maybe Dateline has spoiled me.",1423353600,3,940,4.737804878048781

6243117,5,B00HXXG48E,"I became aware of this case when I moved to Terrebonne Parish after Katrina. This documentary is chilling in it's coverage of the grisly details, sadly tragic in it's portrayal of the effects on the community and families of victims and provocative for the questions it evokes. Why was there no communication between parishes, why was it not given nationwide coverage as other serial murder cases, why do we not pursue the murders of so-called ""low-lifers"" with the same energy and resources as we would for any ""good citizen"".",1409443200,17,527,4.932584269662922

6243121,1,B00HXXG48E,"How anyone could give this documentary more than 2 Stars is beyond me - and many people gave it 5??? WHY?? It was a waste of film. Poorly edited, poorly directed, poorly scripted, there simply were NO redeeming qualities in the film. And my family is from Houma, Louisiana going back at least four generations.

BOTTOM LINE: WHO CARES. This is a story about some degenerate homosexual who killed derelicts over about a 10 year period. The vast majority of victims were homosexual Black Men with no fixed address, no family, no job, no money, no nothing. I forget the exact number of people this nut case killed but it was dozens and dozens. The director found three families to interview. Only Three. The victims were the very dredges of society. Do I care?? Sure, they were human beings. Do I care a lot? No. I don't. Do you?? Be honest with yourself. No, you don't either.",1498521600,2,874,4.56687898089172

6243123,3,B00HXXG48E,"The story needed to be told to be a voice for the victims.  It was done(documentary) the way things are done in the South slow.  I was a little surprised that they took so much time to show long drives down dark roads, and showed killers face barely 2 or three times.  Also I wonder was this video taped because that should have been in this not voice recordings.  I feel as though the killer still had anonymity,  and the victims could have been made mention of instead of detectives standing in a field or minutes of filming of dark roads and basically nothing.  We got the point rural secluded the other 6, 7, 8 times.  To the families of the victims who feel no closure my condolence and heart go out to you.  I really don't think they wanted it to go nationally, because you don't knock on one door when trying to get help, you keep knocking until a door opens.",1490918400,3,866,4.269938650306749

It does have some twists and was decent enough to be worth the watch. I've read that some people felt it was a bit dry and maybe a tiny bit at times, but by no means was it painful to watch-- other than that LA dialect.",1490313600,,390,4.213333333333333
6243126,5,B00HXXG48E,"This documentary outlines a case of a serial murderer with over 20 victims and addresses the question of why it took such a violent criminal so long to be apprehended and how there was so little public concern for the case. It is not presented like a ""true crime thriller,"" so - if you're looking for action - look elsewhere. Nor is it a documentary about the serial killer himself, so if you're looking to ""get into the mind of a serial killer,"" look elsewhere. If you're wondering how you (or at least so many people) have never heard of a recent case where over 20 people were murdered, this might be a documentary you'll be interested in.

I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but it is sad to me that there are so many negative reviews of this documentary because it is ""boring,"" the locals are ""ignorant,"" or their accents are ""hard to understand."" The way I saw it, the point of this documentary was to give a voice to the victims and their families, who were largely overlooked by the general public because they were - for various potential reasons discussed in the documentary - deemed unworthy of media coverage, public outrage, or concern.",1488758400,,1148,4.572815533980583

Documentaries need to give you a reason to watch - some use foreshadowing, some lay down a 911 call while the credits roll - you know, a reason to watch the movie. The entire credits are scene after nature scene, with a country track playing, and give minutes in, NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. You don't know why you're watching it. You don't know what is going on. You have, by the way, heard interviews from at least seven different people telling you they live in a small town. So what? Who cares? What the heck is this about?

If you are on a heavy mind numbing drug, the drudgery might be for you. Some of us like to invest in a story, and there is nothing at all to invest in!",1483747200,2,717,4.195652173913044

I like that they went to some of the body dump sites, but the audio interviews with the killer while showing visuals of driving to the site, really did not have the desired effect with me at all. As a matter a fact, this documentary was kind of bland for me, not giving me much in the way of detail. And only a fraction of the victims were we even told anything about... it falls way short of the whole picture.

Why should that be so hard to understand when ,as tragic as it is ,the victims are a part of a class of people who have been marginalized ,disenfranchised and neglected .Listening to the families speak  you can see that they are part of a group of people that the larger society has kept uneducated,poor and on the fringes. The main stream media spotlighting these  gruesome murders would only high light how our society has abandoned these people in terms of education ,health care (both physical and mental).Of course Society turns away because to face these horrific series of crimes,we would also have to face our failures as a Society. Aside from getting to hear some of the families in their grief ,the documentary did little to inform who these men were and  what their lives were like.

Also, was the killer asked why he preferred black men? I'm sure he was, but this too was not discussed. Was it a question of racism? I agree with most of the families that it was best to have him sit in jail but not because he would actually suffer for what he'd done (I don't believe he cares at all). I do thin, however, that his suffering would be in the lack of access.",1455580800,,554,4.235849056603773

themselves to be tied before being strangled to death.  Their was little history given about the killer who is heard telling how he went about his
grisly business.  He was a white gay man who killed mostly gay men and some who were said to be straight. The majority of his victims were black males with a few being minors. His punishment did not meet his crime, he was spared the death penalty by some victims family members who

The filmmakers had very little grasp of pacing, cinematography, or even story telling. There was no interesting, riveting narration, the entire show was just one boring interview after another, and a lot of riding around and filming from the inside of various cars. The quality of the voice-over audio from police interviews was so bad it was nearly intelligible. A number of the people interviewed had very thick accents, and probably could have used subtitles or closed captioning. One person they interviewed was literally falling asleep during the interview.

Mention of Katrina and the decaying state of the community are like after-thoughts, as are any other facets of the case and its killer beyond repetitive interview clips overlaid on repetitive stock footage.

6243242,3,B00HXXG48E,"An almost well done story. Wow!  there some sick people out here in this world man!  I really felt the pain of the family members of the murdered men and got a great understanding of the Bayou and the serial killers crimes . However, I think the focus was too much on the affected families and the guy who escaped the serial killer - (i.e. the guy on the cover). Why is he on the cover of the documentary anyway instead of the serial killer? That sends mixed messages. I thought he was the serial killer until halfway through. I mean, they showed the actual serial killer like twice through the whole documentary and for a few seconds at that. It felt like the producers of this documentary  were trying to protect that animal in some way. I mean, we heard his voice, saw him fake hobble out of a police station and then saw a bad picture of him at the end.  If the topic is a serial killer, then show the monster to the world properly. We need to know what evil looks like in case we encounter it in the future.

 I also think the documentary would have been better if they showed the serial killer suffering in Angola.  I'm sure the world would be happy if we all saw him in a cage and scared out of his wits. This would satisfy us all and provide proof that he was captured, detained and will never harm another human being ever again.

As a last note, I'm so sorry the Bayou had to deal with that monster and hope it will heal somehow. My prayers go out to the families.",1453161600,3,1474,4.18374558303887

6243246,3,B00HXXG48E,"It would have been nice to include more about the context of the serial killer so that the sociopathy could have been understood better.  The documentary does demonstrate how the lives of the poor are not valued as this killing spree took place for a long period of time.  It is really shameful that there was not a better coordination among law enforcement across parish lines.  What kind of assistance was offered to the families of the victims(i.e., counseling support) and for the individual who escaped the killer?  I do not think that using the storm is a good excuse for the lack of response to the tragedy. This documentary illustrates that there is need for mental health care for rural residents when they have suffered traumatic events.  Hopefully, there is something that can be learned from this situation to assist with policy development.  I am a native of Louisiana and understand the people, the culture, and the history.  More must be done to support both the rural and urban people of this beautiful state, rich in cultural heritage, and history.",1453075200,,1065,4.850828729281768

I read like 5 reviews of people saying I live right there and I didn't know this!!  it WAS a news story there and you people didn't pay attention to it in your damn city and you wanna complain about the new York times... the public defender said this case was the same time as another one where a mom killed her 2 kids and that one got lots of coverage.  People aren't just sitting there deciding that a story is more important or not... readers decide...

And as for people crying about the police what exactly is your problem with what they did??? You know how rare serial killers are?  Of course we can watch a documentary and know it's about a serial killer and connect the dots from the get go... but in real life you don't find 2 bodies and link them automatically and subsequently know immediately when future victims are found that it must be this dame serial killer...

If you don't even know there's one.. it's kinda hard to track one... and don't even get me started on the hurricanes!!! I suppose you guys are gonna criticize how hurricane Katrina caused a 6 month backup..m that's no excuse right??? Give me a break

And I'll tell you one more thing ok who said nobody cares about these people?  The people that ran in these circles knew this stuff was going on and they didn't even watch out for themselves enough to not go off with a rando.

And the Co. D.A. isn't much better letting this guy loose inside a prison where he very likely will do it again.  Like Dahmer, he got off with a prison sentence even though LA still had the death penalty at the time of his sentencing.  Let's face it folks Criminal Justice is so merciful as to make me re-think my position on Capital Punishment!

Maybe if there were more coverage of this killer, he would have been caught sooner?",1436313600,,400,4.418918918918919
6243277,5,B00HXXG48E,"Very sad and emotional. As a mother that lost my oldest son suddenly 3 1/2 years ago, I truly understand to a degree the pain of the families trying to make sense of these horrific crimes. I can barely stand the pain knowing my son just sat down, went to sleep and died and still don't trully know why. I have always said I am blessed to not have to live through the living hell these families are living every minute of their lives. It makes me wonder just how many other serial killers are out there that we never hear about. I am from Louisiana and have a lot of family that live in Houma. I lived across the street from a teenager that grew up to be a serial killer. I have read the book that was written about him. This is definitely a story that should get more attention as all serial killer stories should. Armed with knowledge we can teach our youth to be prepared for these predator's that will keep coming generation after generation. Well done and so glad that I watched it. I applaud the man that had the courage to tell his probation officer about Dominique. If not for his courage there is no telling how many more young men he would have been killed. I pray that by doing this film it will help the families in some small way as they will never truly find real closure until they are reunited with their loved one. One last thought, I truly feel for the families that had to read things about their children that they know are not true. I had to live my own nightmares from people saying my son took a gun and shot himself and other crazy things. It simply was not so. Even today I still feel as if I have to fight for my son's dignity in death as these families are having to do. So sad.....",1436140800,5,1708,4.178787878787879

6243292,5,B00HXXG48E,"I really don't like to start a review on a negative note, however this one warrants such. Bayou Blue is sad, disturbing, and shows  what ails us as a society and nation.
I saw and watched this film/documentary on another site before Amazon - I watched it out of curiosity mostly, also a young woman somewhere on the internet is searching for this- one of her relatives was a victim of serial killer Ronald Dominique who from 1997- 2006 raped and killed 23 men.

I have watched Cajun Justice here on Amazon, much of that show was filmed in these small towns where most of the killings took place, in one of the episodes of Cajun Justice, a man did mention that there had been a serial killer in the area, he didn't mention a name, he looked  embarrassed.
I think most people were just as shocked and surprised as anybody that such a person lived in their area and nobody had a clue what was happening or who the killer was.

It's unfortunate that the only beauty or redeeming feature in this film is the natural beauty that is southeastern Louisiana.
Most of the bayou's are dying and along with it a special way of life. Hurricane Katrina the BP oil spill after that, lack of other jobs in industry or otherwise, chronic poverty and lack of education- who's to blame?. There are many unanswered questions, this has the feel of a whodunit mystery,
since you have to wait til half way through this film to get a brief , glance of the man who is shielded by police and shrouded in darkness, whimpering and head down. Too bad this man didn't seek mental help or have anyone to confide in, many lives would have been spared.

Unfortunately this was real life, not a figment of a writers imagination and many people there in the bayous live with many real fears everyday, fear of losing their way of life and culture, fear of the erosion of the bayous, fear of corruption, fear of being forgotten and misunderstood.
 I think this documentary is food for thought on many levels. Persons judging or looking down on anyone in this film should take a good long look at themselves in the mirror, the persons interviewed on the film may not have cried on camera nor speak the Queens English or several other points made by some (rude and unfeeling, might I add) that were made.
  However, they are the true survivors and in many ways stronger than many of us , who sit in front of our computers and write a review on these kinds of atrocities while others have to live with this misery every day.

 So think before you write something mean people, Karma is very real, and you may have to live the life you just made fun of on this film. If my review has helped click yes below. thank you.",1431216000,15,2676,4.40973630831643

6243295,4,B00HXXG48E,"This movie was scary, and the serial killer was only a small part of the reason why. The overwhelming sense of poverty was what made this so terrifying. I almost felt like I was watching a found footage horror film throughout. The camera makes you feel like you're creeping through the dark. It took me awhile to figure out why the film was making me feel somewhat lost, and then I realized that there was no narration, simply interviews with the victims' families/acquaintances, and you only hear their answers to untaped questions. This forces you to come to your own conclusions, and to think a bit. The interviewees were an interesting bunch; I first fell in love with the South from reading To Kill A Mockingbird, a book rife with metaphor and simile, and a few of the people in this film demonstrated the same Southern habit of lapsing into colorful storytelling, even when recounting personal vignettes about such a tragic event as a family member's murder. There was also the especially Southern terror of homosexuality permeating many of the interviews, with the victims' families making sure to let us know that their sons and brothers would never have participated in any kind of homosexual act without putting up a fight. There were moments when the killings almost seemed a secondary insult to the homosexual rape that took place, which added to the tragic feel of the film overall: these people are not just victims of a heinous crime, they are also victims of their own beliefs and circumstance.",1430870400,6,1510,4.833976833976834
6243296,1,B00HXXG48E,"Bayou Blue is the place that is shrouded in folklore and culture, so when the bodies of black and poor white men were discovered, it drew very little press coverage.  Minimal press coverage, the demographics of the victims, the ecological landscape, and Bayou culture made this a case that seemed straight out of a crime novel.

However, this documentary lacked all the suspense of a good crime novel.  Here we have a portly white male killing random men, but why?  We know he's gay, has a penchant for stocky black males, and that he is from Cajun Country.  But what else?  There's no backstory of the murderer or the murdered, no specifics on why he did these crimes, and if there were any precursors prior to the killings.  In fact, if the filmmakers spent as much time developing the documentary as they did explaining the shrinking wetlands it may have been better.  Just maybe, because this film had a lot of potential to delve further into the subject but fell absolutely flat.",1430784000,,984,4.680232558139535

After Katrina I was in Leesville, LA for a couple of months and my daughter and her fiance were in Golden Meadow, LA.  I never even heard about the murders or the serial killer.  In 2006 I was thinking of moving to Houma and was checking out real estate in that area.  No one mentioned the murders.  The first I heard about this serial killer was tonight while browsing Amazon instant video's.

The only explanation of why no one from out state expressed any interest I can think of, is that people (from out of state) who were sympathetic to LA during Hurricane Katrina figure that they already gave emotionally. I guess they used up any remaining sympathy they still had on the BP oil spill.  Well, I have sympathy for the victims and their families and I'm glad they caught the murderer.

I wonder if he is still alive in prison or if he's dead.  I doubt if he felt any remorse about his actions other than getting caught.  That is why he's a monster. He's probably missing the parts that would have made him a human being instead of a crazed killer.",1426118400,2,1157,4.380281690140845
