4665545,5,B005EKWZ36,My daughter loves this show and wanted it.  It kept her entertained. I love the fact that it had 2 seasons in 1.,1349049600,,112,3.869565217391304
4665546,5,B005EKWZ36,"This is a great cartoon and an awesome deal for less than 7 dollars for a 4 DVD set containing 2 full seasons. My three sons (yes I know the phrase) love this cartoon. Shoot, even my wife and I like it. This a great purchase for the car on long trips. Would recommend to all parents.",1342051200,2,283,3.982456140350877
4665547,1,B005EKWZ36,"PROs:
Price: The price is a great deal!
Length: You get 4 DVD's each at least 3 hrs, great if you need to put a DVD in as ""background noise"" in a kid friendly setting.
The Material: It's palatable for adults with enough silly gags to keep kids laughing.

CONs:
DVDs: The DVD's appear to have a manufacturing defect as they came scratched in the exact same manner on each disc. The discs still play and for the price and hassle, I will keep them. This is the main reason this review is 3 stars instead of 5.
Packaging:  The DVD's are in 4 sleeves inside the DVD case instead of the usual circle mount holding the DVD in place.  If you have children that handle DVD's be prepared for the sleeves to be lost plan accordingly if you want to keep the discs unscratched and working.  (maybe get 4 old DVD cases with the circle mounts)

Things that didn't affect my decision to purchase but may affect yours:
No subtitles for the hearing impaired.
Johhny engages in a lot of ""typical"" boy behavior and humor, meaning some fighting and body function gags and sound effects.

Given the price, I am satisfied with this purchase.

UPDATE: 3/27/12  Lowered my review to 1 star.
(I've had the discs for 2 days) The DVD's skipped and would not play in the last few cartoons of EACH disc the first time I played them.  I went to the Episode Menu on each disc and selected the last one or two cartoons-they would not play so I sent it back to Amazon for an exchange.  I received the ""new"" discs today and right out of the box and securtity tape- SAME ISSUE!  The DVD's do not appear new and seem to have a ""bubbled"" effect in the center where you'd normally mount the DVD (If it had a center mount)
3 of the 4 DVD sleeves don't appear new.  Even though I've never seen it before, everything but the outside cover screams heat damage and repackaged.  I will keep the discs because I like what cartoons do play but I understand why the price is so good and I'm glad I didn't pay more.",1332633600,6,1966,4.281081081081081
4665548,5,B005EKWZ36,Wonderful entertainment for older childern. Lots of action and Johnny even learns a few things along the way. My 12 yr old grandson loves this show.,1332460800,,148,4.730769230769231

4665550,5,B005EKWZ36,"You wanted more Johnny Test.  You demanded more Johnny Test.  You'd whine, plead, and beg to your parents like Johnny Test for more Johnny Test.  Well, grovel no more 'cause he's back in a brand new DVD set !  There's 39 episodes spanning the third and fourth seasons on four discs that include a lot of my all-time favorite episodes such as:

""Johnny 'Mon"" - Johnny gets zapped into his ""Tinymon"" video game and must do battle in order to get out.

""Johnny Bench"" - Johnny needs to make a bench for Wood Shop class.  How hard can it be ?

""Johnny Cart Racing"" - It's an all out race in Porkbelly as Johnny goes up against his friends and foes for the Super Champion of the World.

""Return of Johnny 'Mon"" - Once again, Johnny gets zapped into his new ""Tinymon"" video game, but this time his dad gets zapped, too.

""Johnny Dukey Doo"" - Ghosts are haunting an old inn that's about to be destroyed.  Johnny, his dog Dukey, and his sisters Susan and Mary get to the bottom of this.

""Papa Johnny"" - Johnny and his dad switch brains to see who has it worse.

""The Johnnyminster Dog Show"" - Dukey wants to compete in a dog show to see who's the best dog in town.

""Tom and Johnny"" - Mr. Mittens, a cat who seeks revenge on Johnny, returns.  And worse, Johnny has been turned into a mouse !

""Who's Johnny?"" - Susan and Mary attempt to change their brother's personality, and it isn't pretty.

""Johnny Test in 3D"" - Johnny goes up against a seaside hotel manager who forbids pets.

""King Johnny"" - Johnny plays the ultimate game of chess.  With special enhancements from his genius sisters, of course.

""Johnny Tube"" - Johnny desperately tries to make a popular internet video.

The set also includes bonus episodes of 3 other shows: ""Nanoboy"", ""Gadget Boy"", and ""Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors"".  There's even an exclusive digital comic for your DVD-ROM.  So make a few whip-crack sound effects and get this DVD set (at an amazing value, I might add) to add to your collection.  Don't forget: the first two seasons are also available (at an equally low price), and new episodes are being added weekly on Cartoon Network !",1320537600,4,2116,4.464751958224543

4665562,5,B005EKWZ36,"I will admit, I am 18 years old. And I absolutely love Johnny Test! I specifically love Season 3 and 4 of Johnny Test. 14 hours of footage on Johnny Test for $8 is an absolute buy. The DVD comes in 4 discs..  To my knowledge, I don't believe this is an HD DVD.. I played it on my DVD, and I got a letterboxed widescreen format, when I played it on my laptop it was on a 16:9 fullscreen. Use component cables, and it still looks like HD quality. A lot better than the TV rips they broadcast on television.",1363824000,,504,3.99009900990099
4665563,5,B005EKWZ36,My favorite is Johnny Tube.  My favorite aspect though is the music used in the series.  I like the guitar work used in Johnny Tube and in most of the rest of the series.  I'm looking forward to seeing seasons five and six on DVD.,1353024000,,230,4.066666666666666

8468424,3,B005EKWZ36,"Mill Creek smashed the video. Seasons 3-6 are supposed to be in 1.78:1 but instead of a proper center crop they squashed the video down to 4:3.
Using VLC media player I changed the aspect ratio to stretch 16:9 and it doesn't appear warped at all. DHX Cookie Jar gave them the series but they squished it down to 4.3. Not a major issue at all.",1443830400,,342,4.196969696969697
