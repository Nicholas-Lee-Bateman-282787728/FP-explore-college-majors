74146,4,0784017964,"If you look at my other reviews, you can see I am a Denise Austin fan, and this video did not disappoint.
You get a great toning workout in a short period of time (I like pairing this with one of her aerobic videos).  Denise is always very bubbly and explains things quite well, in my opinion.  She also reminds you of little things so you don't hurt yourself or pass out (like keep your head over your heart-- no head rushes!).
The only thing that kept me from giving this video 5 stars was that I found it to be a little too easy for me.  If you have very little muscle tone, this video would be perfect for you.  I am not Arnold Schwarzenegger, but I am able to lift heavy things quite well and to put up a decent fight in an arm-wrestling match with an average guy.  Thus I found that after the tape was over, I had to keep doing the exercises I learned in the video to feel like my muscles were working.  So this video was good to teach me the exercises and to motivate me to do them, but it didn't totally satisfy me.
So, to sum up, Five Star video if you're low-muscle, to put it nicely, and Four Star if you're average, like me.  Definitely not for the already-toned or very muscular.",1020643200,12,1192,4.112068965517241
74147,4,0784017964,"This is truly a lite tone-up, but not so lite that it feels useless.  It was very good for me being about 100lbs. overweight when I started using it.  Denise uses a chair and light weights to work the arms, shoulders, legs and  abs and then ends with stretching for a total 30min workout.  After about 4 weeks of use, I have noticed a decided increase in my upper body strength, more defined arms and my thighs are a bit slimmer.  The music sucks, but you can turn down the sound of the tape and play your own music once you know the routine.  Denise does give good advice about form and exactly what the purpose of each excercise is.  She's also very encouraging.",1011571200,14,664,4.306451612903226
74148,4,0784017964,"I have been a fan of Denise Austin for years. I ordered the xtra lite tone up, because I haven't done any formal exercise in about 12 yrs. So I was out of shape. It was almost TOO lite. But still a very worthwhile video for your library. It is perfect for those days that you are sore from overdoing the previous day. Or on days that you maybe have a cold and don't feel that well, but don't want to miss your workout. It is strictly toning, so you aren't going to get fit owning only this one tape. You can increase the intensity of the workout by using heavier weights, or adding ankle weights. I enjoyed it, I used 3 lb weights which was perfect for me. I would like to add some ankle weights, because the lower body workout was too easy. Just had a baby? Havent worked out in a long time? Need a lite backup for days you cant work out as heavily as usual? This is the tape for you. Concentrates on posture, and how to exercise correctly. Good instruction from Ms Austin as well.",1011139200,12,982,4.146596858638744
74149,1,0784017964,"After buying Xtra Light Aerobics by Denise Austin and loving it, I thought I'd try this one. What a waste. You do the same step about a hundred times- okay slight exaggeration. I had been working out with weights before this, just 10 lbs on each arm with various exercises. When I tried this one I used 3 lbs on each arm. The steps themselves weren't that difficult, but she never let up. You would do so many reps without a break in between. I couldn't do it. I went back to my own work-out and did a lot better. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1006905600,4,550,4.19811320754717
74150,4,0784017964,"Very well presented video of exercises for the ultimate beginner.  Ms. Austin gives you motivation, and praise as she demonstrates each excercise.  A good way to start the day.",994204800,3,176,5.0344827586206895
74151,4,0784017964,"I began this video about four weeks ago and have already noticed a significant difference.  When I decided I needed to get back in shape, it  was a challenge to find a medium that would  be fun, provide a decent  workout and yet not be too difficult or time consuming. I started with the  companion in this series, Xtralite Beginner's Aerobics, and then added this  video for target toning and muscle definition.  One of the really great  things about Denise is that she very briefly explains the correct way to do  each move and which muscle each movement is working without explaining it  to death. Also, she doesn't count out each repetition so the workout seems  to just fly by and she creates an atmosphere that makes you feel like she  is your personal trainer. I have noticed in other videos that  ""toning"" tends to mean ""abs workout"", in this video  Denise works both the upper and lower body for great shoulders, arms, back,  legs and abs.  You can personalize the workout by adding more weight or  stoping the video and adding more reps.  Both of the Xttralite videos are  filmed on a beautiful beach and the sound of the waves helps to drown out  the music, which isn't all that great.  Other than that, this is a fabulous  beginning tone up that can easily be done everyday and only requires a  small area, a chair, and hand weights.",966384000,46,1345,4.535564853556485

7790850,4,0784017964,I got this tape when it first came out many yrs ago. The tape finally wore out and I had to track down a new one. It is a tape that isn't difficult but does the trick for me! I actually do it on a regular basis. I never do that with any other tapes. Good esp. for older women who want to build up muscle and get toned in a comfortable way. Took a long time to receive it due to the sender's policy of using the cheapest USPO rates.,1323648000,2,431,3.7472527472527473
7790851,5,0784017964,This video is great for anyone who wants to begin an exercise regimen.  It provides results while not over doing the muscles for aches and pains like some workout videos.  I would highly recommend this tape.,1301616000,,207,4.722222222222222

To me, the video had a little bit of everything: a mild cardio warm up, weight lifting and a stretching cool down. For this video you will need a couple of items: a chair, hand weights, and maybe head and wrist bands. I would recommend this video to anyone who is just starting out.",1297036800,,439,4.238095238095238

The moves are basic, but it's good for the time crunched, fitting everything into a half hour with light stretch to follow.  It's not the most challenging but when you need the assistance of a tape to get you disciplined and moving, it helps.",1020902400,15,338,4.349206349206349
