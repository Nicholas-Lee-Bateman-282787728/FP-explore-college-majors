8109725,4,B000EHPXOW,"Yes,I rated this film 4-stars. Why,Because of wild east productions. They

are doing a wonderful job on these almost lost Italian Westerns. But don't

take my word for it. Check them out yourself. Or go on line at WWW.WIDEAST.

NET.First off,there are no good guys in this movie,there all bad,except

for the bind man,the father of the dead confederate soldier,that CHIP

CORMAN,The main actor,come's across at the river bed,who is also known as

EL DESPORADO in the movie. The story is set around the civil war,with

gold and greed as the motive. Sound fimiliar????Any way,the only thing i

find amu""z""ing in this move,is that when people get shot,there is no

blood marks or bullet holes to show for it,kind of get shot,look dramatic

and die and fall in any mud hole in the street,plus the blind man get's

killed in a sadistic kind of way,you will recognize him as one of the

great characters of many italian westerns. All in all a get above B

average,or in my opinion between A&B,maybe a B+. It is worth have in my

collection,Or any body's collection if you love these movie's as i do.

GREAT OPENING THEME with vocals,which flow's with the movie. WILD EAST

PRODUCTIONS in my opinion rank's right up there with ANCHOR BAY AND

BLUE UNDERGROUND,With extras,and restoring this movie,so clear and crisp

the dubbing is superb since the movie was dubbed in english for USA

Release back in the sixties. There voices are all in sink. The film score

was restored as well. CHECK IT OUT,YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED.",1158883200,13,1515,4.753846153846154
