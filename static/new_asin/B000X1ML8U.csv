8226541,5,B000X1ML8U,""" This will be the last summer ... No more winters "" declares a central character early in the film . "" Farewell Falkenberg "" observes five young friends as they say goodbye to their teens in the small swedish town of Falkenberg . Although abstract and kind of scattered at first , the movie takes a stormy turn after it's halfway mark from what seemed a nostalgic card postal of our youth passing us by to a more dramatic , deep territory . All five amateur actors , from which the two of them are real-life brothers , give natural perfomances , the music by Erik Enocksson is hauntingly beautiful ( definetely one of the best scores i have heard ) and the monologue near the end will bring tears in your eyes .Truly a gem waiting to be discovered !",1192924800,2,750,4.288732394366197
