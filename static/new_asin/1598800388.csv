7800049,5,1598800388,I have all of Rick Steves more recent shows but these really complete the set.  It is so helpful to actually be able to see where you are going before you get there.  I find him to be the most helpful guide when visiting any country in Europe.,1393804800,,243,4.041666666666667
7800050,5,1598800388,"Our family started watching Rick Steves' shows back in 1997 before a trip to Europe - so we could prepare. We've been RS fans since. His shows are always interesting, educational and, what sites he chooses to highlight always prove to be valuable and worthwhile. Highly recommend.",1379462400,,280,4.9787234042553195

I would have given this collection five stars, but several of these episodes have been released on other collections.  There are a number of different Rick Steves video packages available; select them carefully to ensure you get what you want.",1216080000,,809,4.496503496503497
7800053,4,1598800388,"My family loves Rick Steves. We watched him whenever we could on PBS, but we always wanted more. I had ordered the complete collection of his 70 shows from 2000-2007, and I figured this collection would cover the rest. While we love this collection, most of these shows can be found on the larger collection, something I did not realized till I got it home. We still love it.",1215561600,2,375,4.449275362318841
7800054,4,1598800388,"The title for this DVD is correct. It is shows from the original Rick Steves travels in Europe. A great show on PBS. For those who have bought DVD's of Rick Steves in the past, you may end up getting some doubles here. One reason I gave a rating of 4 stars.

Disk one has some new episodes which where only seen on tv and vhs before. Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Norway episodes are now on DVD. Wish personaly they would do more Scandanavia other than quick 24 minute shows on the capitols. There is also added side trips France and England and the original Alps episodes for France, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy not seen yet on DVD. Very worth the viewing.

Disk two has been produced twice now on DVD. This is basically the Greece, Turkey, Israel, Egypt DVD all over again. Nothing really new. But still worth a look if you have not seen them before.

With the episodes from 2000 and up being produced on one huge DVD, these are a nice added collection to have.",1153872000,10,967,4.391061452513966
