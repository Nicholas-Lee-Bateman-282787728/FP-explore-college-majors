Ben Elton was writing Blackadder II at the same time, and it seems like this program didn't get the script attention it deserved.  Extremely funny though, if you're into ""bot and knob"" gags and self-referential humor.  (P)Rick and Vyvyan are pretty much carried over from TYO, rechristened Richie Rich and Eddie Catflap.  Nigel Planer has an entirely new character, ""the impresario, promoter, pornographer and common thief"" Ralph Filthy (a.k.a. Filthy Ralph).

Things I have learned from Filthy Ralph:

1. ""No matter how many milkmen you kill, it'll never become fashionable.""

2. ""When the going gets tough, the tough have a fag and a drink and a ponder.""

If you're in the USA, buy a multiregion DVD player.  Just do it.  I bought mine (Philips DVP3140) from Amazon for USD 43.00.  I got this DVD from Amazon UK for UKL 7.00!  The player will play DVDs from any region and has already paid for itself because the UK disks are so much cheaper. You can also play Australian and Chinese DVDs.",1239408000,,1097,4.807486631016043
8154424,5,B000K5HUYY,"Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall are often accused of playing the same characters over and over again and normally they are right.  This is the exeption.  Edmondson plays a kind of ""Anti-Vyvyian"" (If you haven't already seen the Young Ones, none of this will make sense to you.)  Mayall does do another Rik but takes it somewhere really strange.  I like this series best of them all.",1227571200,,379,4.611940298507463
8154425,5,B000K5HUYY,"This is one of the funniest things I have ever watched.  This is much more Young Ones than Bottom.  If you like the Young Ones, spend a few bucks and get this, you will not be dissappointed.  If you don't know its the same actors who play Rick, Neil, and Vyvyan.

Its probably the wrong region for your DVD player, but the DVD software in your computer will probably be able to reset itself to let you watch it.  Look into it.  That is how I have to watch it.",1208822400,,459,4.044444444444444
