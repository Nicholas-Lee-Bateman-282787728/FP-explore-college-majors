4559843,2,B00545D5U8,"If this series had been completely reset in Germany, I'd probably give it 4 stars.

But the stolidity of the production, and acting (especially by the actors playing the Brunetti family members, with the exception of the actress playing the teen-age daughter) contrasting with the Venice locations and Italian  situations and characters , creates a level of unintended absurdity which for me makes the series very hard to watch.",1318896000,6,428,5.188405797101449

4559845,4,B00545D5U8,"Well done, German TV!! No other country appears to have taken this project on, despite 18 novels sold in the millions of copies, I am sure. I really enjoyed these episodes of the Brunetti books. I also got the other two episodes (3 and 4)and am eagerly awaiting as many as Amazon will carry. The characters are faithfully rendered and the stories follow Brunetti's frustration in trying to get his job done and his moral struggles as well. Paola should be a blond, but her personality is spot-on, as are those of Vianello and the other cops, as well as those of Brunetti and his children. Patta looks a little too Germanic, but his personality fits the descriptions in Leon's stories to a ""T"" (suitably selfish, social-climbing, and dismissive of Brunetti's efforts unless he makes Patta look good in front of the powerful in Venice). Brunetti is sympathetic and noble ad looks the part. As for the scenes shot in Venice, what can one say? It is the most beautiful city in the world. I am glad the film company realized that not to make Venice the main star of the episodes would have been a mistake, as Venice is as much a part of Brunetti and the others as they are of the city.",1315267200,71,1180,4.493023255813953
4559846,4,B00545D5U8,"I have been waiting for the German TV shows made from the Donna Leon books for quite awhile, and I am pleased with
the results.  Four episodes are now available with English subtitles, thanks to the MHz Network.  The actors are German, but they all look Italian.  The main character, Commissario Guido Brunetti, is not quite as I had
pictured him from the books:  here he's shorter, balding, and has an impish face, but I found him quite appealing.  The other characters are just as believable.  And the cinematography around Venice is spectacular.
Well worth the expense.",1309219200,49,572,4.845360824742268
4559847,5,B00545D5U8,"I purchased episodes 1-2 and 3-4.  I would recommend these DVDs to all students of German.  The actors, of course, are native German speakers.  The characters are mostly from ""good families"" so that there is no slang, swearing, or other bad words.  You may need subtitles at first, but the second time, already knowing the plot, you should be able to follow the dialogues without having to read the translation.

The plots are interesting:  more so than the Montalbano series (which I enjoyed mostly because I had read the books), or the Coliandro series (funny but with a lot of cursing); and definitely more interesting than the new Masterpiece Theater series, ""Zen"" (I just watched the second episode: the plot was very thin; with a lot of ""private-life"" bits thrown in).

4559865,1,B00545D5U8,"I've read many of Donna Leon's Commissario Brunetti Mysteries. I loved them; the setting, the characters, especially Brunetti, the food, the nuances of how Brunetti sees things. My spouse hasn't read the books, so when I discovered the DVDs I told him he was in for a treat and really looked forward to watching the DVDs. What a complete DISAPPOINTMENT. We were dumbfounded to hear it was in German. Even though they had English subtitles, the magic was gone after hearing the first word.

What a pity that the series could not be produced by an Italian film company with Italian actors. The only redeeming factor is the Venetian location and even that was compromised by the casting of German Actors who looked nothing like imagined. Sorry, but it was so disheartening that we struggled to finish the first one and will return the 2nd to the library, without watching. Glad they were from the library vs. purchase, but maybe then our comments will not be accepted. Commissario Brunetti just doesn't work for us in this production, nor does Patta or most of the other characters. By comparison, we love the Inspector Montalbano DVDs.

4559880,3,B00545D5U8,"Up front,let me say that this is a good, expensively produced series. It's fine if you haven't read the books. But, I have. I understand Ms.  Leon will not allow her work to appear in Italian books or TV. That's the problem. This German production has obviously German people walking around the real Venice pretending to be Italian. Largely missing is the emotion, the compassion so often displayed by the real Italian characters in the books. There is too little of the Italian obsession with connections and power; too much lawful obedience to capture the seductive quality of the books. So, enjoy the TV show first, then get the real thing in Ms. Leon's pages.",1404777600,,663,4.765217391304348

My picture of the Brunetti family is very clear, since I have read all the novels. Brunetti himself did not fit my picture of him, which is not to say the actor did not perform well. He did, and was a very like able character, just not physically as I expected. On the other hand, Paula, Chiara,Raffi and Vianello were exactly as I pictured them. The Venetian setting is gorgeous, and adds greatly to the whole effect. I found the subtitling in this series more distracting ( the original is in German) than the subtitling in the Montalbano series ( in which the original is Italian) , even though I know neither language...strange!
I understand from reading other reviews that the players change in later episodes. I would have been OK with these.",1398556800,2,898,4.75

First, I was not very receptive to German as the language for this series and for a long time, I just couldn't get over that.  I finally decided to try one.  The German language is not the problem, the casting is.  I don't know what could have possessed anyone to cast this series with this actor in the lead.  Brunetti was never namby pamby and although quiet, he's bright and intelligent.  Same with Patta. who in this series is far less a dandy.  The wife is not bad casting.

It's a well done series and the lead Joachim Krol is well cast as Brunetti but not so with some of the other actors and sometimes it makes for the occasional discomfort while watching - but the Venetian scenery can make up for everything!

4559907,5,B00545D5U8,"I panned this once I opened it and found out it is in German. The website should have announced it boldly instead of sneaking it into the list of minor details.

I almost threw it away but watched it and found the characters did not behave particularly German, instead they worked as Italians. I got used to ignoring the language, appreciated the voices and tones (some of which may have been dubbed), and read the translations.

This is an excellent series. The only questionable note was the secretary, which interesting, unique character was miscast and misinterpreted, I thought. She behaves seductively toward Brunetti as they gaze too long, inexplicably, into each other's eyes. Otherwise, the characters matched the books just fine. There are two Brunettis actors and two of his wives, switching soon after the first one or two series. All are fine. I preferred the second wife actor but both are good.

The family meals, and both of the children (the same actors throughout) are great and reasons in themselves to enjoy the series.",1346803200,3,1039,4.925714285714286
4559908,1,B00545D5U8,"Yes I read all the books, yes I expected it to be in Italian (the rental I chose had NO product description) so I was caught off guard with the German (subtitles were ok) which took me about 20 minutes of distracting watching to settle in. But i was most dismayed at the lack of character building. Brunetti comes off as a bit of a dufus and Paola is nothing like the interesting character that she is in the book.. You can see they were trying, but really, other than seeming to follow the story to the letter, they missed conveying the complex characterization of the  characters like the book does and being shot in Venice wasn't enough to make up for it.

 I don't know what they were trying to achieve with the style of cinematography but it reminded me of watching a movie from the 1940s or 50's... It felt dated and had a constant music in the background that was odd. I know there were a lot of complaints about it being in German. This is not my issue, it just did not feel Italian to me and creative process or not, the series is clearly Italian, with rich characters and they missed the mark there.

Sometimes it works to make books into movies, sometimes it doesn't. It just didn't make it as a whole for me. Too many odd things to get past to make it compelling or interesting enough to consider spending my time watching another just because I like the books.",1344470400,8,1373,4.330739299610895

The production quality is very high, and the actors are among the best performing in German film and television today.  The cinematography is wonderful and shows the very best of Venice without the hordes of tourists in the way.  The stories and characters may vary some from the books, but this is almost always the case when literature is converted to film.

This is filmed in Venice with German actors speaking German. This may sound silly but it's hard to transport your mind to Venice when the language is wrong.  The scenery was not as good as in Montalbano either.  It seems like there are a limited number of shots you can make in Venice.  Brunetti comes across as a bit wimpy and PC.  Do cops act that way anywhere in the world? This guy is always smiling and smarmy and apologizing to the bad guys for the inconvenience. Who does that?  The stories are simpler than Montalbano.  It's a serial progression of things and somewhat boring.  With Montalbano there are other things happening that may or may not be part of the story, it's keeps your interest up.  The big thing I miss is the rich characters in Montalbano.  Brunetti's seem two dimensional and very formulaic. Not worth the money.",1332288000,6,981,4.678362573099415

To me these television versions get it half right at best. The beauty of Venice is there, and it is a real pleasure.  Brunetti himself is pretty good. He is kind and committed.  His generally happy home life also comes through well and that too is a pleasure and in contrast with so much else on film. But there is a great deal that makes the books so good that does not come through. Complexity is lacking, including Brunetti's. And the pervasive corruption that haunts Brunetti is not quite tangible enough. It is not as powerful a limiting force - limiting what is possible for Brunetti to accomplish as well as his enjoyment of Venice and the beautiful world he inhabits due to ample money and happy marriage. The plots themselves seem so much thinner as well. So, overall, for a Brunetti fan these are pleasurable but also lacking. The books still await a truly inspired translation to film.",1329696000,105,1202,4.607476635514018
4559930,4,B00545D5U8,"What an odd mix of impressions fans of Donna Leon's Commissario Brunetti books are likely to find themselves having with the onscreen version:  Gorgeous cinematography of glorious Venice, where the actors playing Italians all speak their lines in German while we American viewers read English subtitles.  (Another reviewer here mentioned that this all becomes less jarring if you cut the volume way down.  Wish I'd thought of that.)

The first double feature in this series tells tales from two of Leon's early Brunetti books, published in 1994-95. ""The Anonymous Venetian"" gets its title from the British version of Brunetti Book #3, known in the U. S. as ""Dressed for Death.""  It tells of a prominent Venetian banker who is found dead in drag queen makeup, with shaved legs and wearing red high heels.  ""Vendetta,""  based on book #4,  known as ""Death and Judgment"" in the U.S. and ""A Venetian Reckoning"" in Britain, is the story of a prostitution ring run by influential Venetians who import young girls from Eastern Europe by the truckload. (This info doesn't come with the discs. I was able to figure it out because I still have the books.)

So how well will the Germans' takes on Brunetti et al measure up to the Leon characters we readers have been carrying around in our heads? Hard to tell, as the opinions on that in these reviews seem to vary all over the place. Here's my take, for what it's worth (probably not much.): The Brunetti in my head isn't short, balding and twinkly-eyed, but the actor playing him here is and he's very very good in the role.  The Vianello of my imagination doesn't tower over his boss and weigh maybe twice as much, as this one does, but he's not the doofus I thought him to be early on and the more I saw of him, the more I came to like and respect him.  While both Paola and Signorina Elettra are beauties, I think their roles lack the distinctive character, intellect and singular pizzazz of their print counterparts.  Neither of the Brunetti kids bears even the tiniest resemblance to a parent.  The big disappointment for me was Patta.  As with  Paola and Elettra, I fault the writing more than the acting.  This Patta doesn't come across anywhere near as incompetent,  pompous and in the pocket of the powerful  as his print version does.  Maybe these key roles will develop and distinguish themselves  more as the series continues.

Sidenote:  At a bookstore appearance here in Washington in 2009,  Donna Leon told us that she was then in talks with a prominent British TV producer who wanted to do a Brunetti series for the BBC.  She said that, like her deal with the Germans, she'd leave them alone to recreate her stories as they liked and the only thing she'd requested (though not demanded) of the Brits is that the music be Baroque. (Guess she didn't like that German score.) As for the Germans, she didn't like it that,  as the series went on,  they were apparently turning Brunetti's mother,  who is a very minor character in the books, into a major character in the TV version,  probably because  a very popular German actress had been cast in that role.  Ms. Leon solved that  annoyance by killing the old girl off in her next book. Two years later, in the spring of '11 at another bookstore gig, there was no mention at all of that projected BBC series, so I guess it must not have worked out. (Note: Not having yet seen the rest of the series, I don't know where Brunetti's mom appears; she's not in either of these first two in the series.)

It's a German production, done completely in German right down to newspaper headlines. And that's fine if you're a German speaker, just as it would be fine in English for an American or a Brit. A show set in Italy, done in German is unnerving for an English speaker.

So I watched this with the sound turned low and read the English subtitles and enjoyed it immensely. Still, I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had been dubbed into English.",1326931200,3,535,4.680851063829787
4559933,5,B00545D5U8,"Donna Leon's Inspector Brunetti mysteries have come visiting our home screens with these surprisingly entertaining DVDs. If you have read the books then it will take a bit or maybe a short while to readjust in yiour mind's eye to the series. But here's the thing: you will and you will find yourself being pulled into the storylines and wonderful and maybe not always wonderful views of Venice. The city comes alive, as it should, with something other than a Disney-Veniceland experience of travelogues. Venice is very much a busy and working city and the DVDs convey that, complete with day to day water-based events, the folks and families that make it home, and in a format that even gets into the power and political struggles of the historical city and state.
  While the German cast and dialogue initially threw me a bit I still came to enjoy the productions and enjoyed Krol as Brunetti in the initial four productions. They brought in another actor as Brunetti in the later DVDs and that is slightly annoying as well. However, the actors do a very good job of making Leon's stories come alive so come on in and enjoy the shows that are sometimes dark and disturbing but always entertaining. Five stars, regardless.",1325980800,4,1222,4.759433962264151
4559934,5,B00545D5U8,"If you like the Donna Leon books, you will LOVE seeing them unfold in Venice. The photography is lush, the characters are well portrayed, and the German did not distract.  Don't be put off by the subtitles.  It is also nice to hear German spoken, not snarled by Nazis as in the movies.  Always best to have read books first.  Love Guido and his family relationships as much as the mysteries.",1325376000,4,391,4.464788732394366
4559935,4,B00545D5U8,"Right now i have the first six episodes of the show. The scenery is gorgeous, the shows a full 90  minutes and well- written, and a special treat if you love Donna Leon's books. The only thing I disliked was the change of lead actor (Brunetti) and actress (Paola) in the fifth episode. I don't know why they changed the characters, but I though Krol was an excellent Brunetti; he had a love for his family that shone in each epiode. The way he interacted with Vianello, Paola, his children, Signora Elletra - there was a vunerability to Brunetti. The actiress who played Paola was very subtle, the way I expected Paola to be; it more what she didn't say than what she said.

That said, when the lead actors change came, I knew it would be a bit odd, having gotten accustomed to the original people playing the parts. The new Brunetti is a bit brusque, slimmer, a bit more arrogant. That vulnerability that I found so appealing is gone. Paola, sadly is much more one-dimensional.

The new episodes are good, but I would have enjoyed them more had they stuck to the original actors.

Other than that, great series.",1325289600,8,1112,4.517412935323383
4559936,5,B00545D5U8,"These are just awesome.  I happen to be a big Brunetti fan; I think if you like Brunetti, you'll love this, but I'm pretty sure these programs would also work if you're not familiar with Brunetti.  The acting, direction and screenplay are extremely good.  It's pretty much faithful to the plot, though not slavishly so.  The exterior shots of Venice are gorgeous, and I'm always happy to see that, but the interior shots are breathtaking.  I've seen most of the exterior scenes in person; never had a chance to see interiors of palazzi like this.

So, I mean it's Brunetti, it's beautiful, bellisimo, it's extremely well done, it's Venice.  What else could you ask for?

Also, like I said, I do love the Brunetti stories very much, but there's not much humor in them, or it doesn't come through for me, and at least some of the characters-- I'm thinking especially of Vianello-- don't come through for me either.  It adds a lot to see those characters brought to life, I didn't realize Brunetti and Vianello were so full of humor and good will.  They're not telling jokes or anything, they just exude these qualities.  I'll read them differently next time.  And Elettra-- porco santa!  And Paola is so gorgeous.
The casting is really outstanding.

A couple of people complained that the subtitles were too quick; I don't see that, wouldn't have had that thought if someone else hadn't mentioned it.  Not a problem.  Some people, maybe the same people, are bothered by the fact that it's in German, with English subtitles.  Again, I didn't find that to be a problem at all.  It was strange for about 5 seconds.  If it does bother you, I'd suggest just accepting it, and you'll probably get used to it in a few minutes.  Or you could just turn the sound down; you're reading subtitles anyway.  In fact, you can turn the sound down to a point where you can hardly even tell what language it is, but you still have the music and the voices.

If you like Brunetti, or if it sounds interesting, give it a shot.  I doubt you'll be sorry.",1321574400,15,2030,4.562326869806094

They are subtitled which means you don't miss any of the dialogue. I have read all the books and anxiously await a new one each time. I hope the rest of the movies are made available, I will purchase all of them. The episodes are very well acted and the music is great as well.

This I would be  ready to live with, as long as the main character which is Venice itself was adequately showcased. But it is not. I believe this is not the creators fault  but the fault of Mhz and the image compression techniques they used. The DVD  is produced by MMz and like the Inspector Montalbano  DVD's I have purchased from them, the image quality is horrible. These series, Montalbano and Brunetti feature beautiful settings  and this is an important part of the story for the aficionados  I purchased the DVD's rather than streaming from MHZ in order to get a better image for my large screen TV and to be able to fully appreciate the quality of the series. The Inspector Brunetti images are a bit better than The Montalbano. The backgrounds are a bit sharper. However nothing similar to a good quality DVD. Also on some Brunetti DVDs, when the camera moves the background moves in a stuttering fashion which is very annoying. These are most probably artifacts from the compression process used. Not recommended.",1526169600,,1096,4.742105263157895

8456288,1,B00545D5U8,"I have loved this series of books and was so disappointed to find such a quintessential Italian story brought to film in anything but the Italian language. My brain kept seeing Venice populated by a cast of Germans and I just couldn't successfully merge the two. I also thought the casting didn't fit the characters, all throughout the cast, but Brunetti was the worst. He was smallish with a child-like, puffy face that didn't project the kind of confidence and strength I saw in him in the books. Nor did the costuming fit. These people, the Brunetti family, were beautifully written into being as lovers of culture, reading chief among them. In this production Brunetti lumbers about Venice like a troglodyte in a misshapen car coat. Other than the beautiful scenes of Venice, this production lacked any grace and style, two characteristics that were in abundance in the books. I'm sending mine back after viewing just 15 minutes worth.",1504483200,2,939,4.911949685534591
8456289,3,B00545D5U8,"As avid Donna Leon readers, we were disappointed with these interpretations of her characters and stories. Leon is a skilled writer, who infuses Brunetti and his family with love and small kindnesses, yet most of the video series shows family tension and petty disputes. This is true of the Patta character, as well, who is thinly drawn as a self-serving dolt, and not the nuanced,and crafty bureaucrat that Leon has created. The German production was quite professional, and the actors were extremely good. We were also tempted to settle for the lovely images of Venice, and some of the enjoyable stories. In the end, though, the lack of love and compassion let us down. This was not the Donna Leon that we have come to know.",1500595200,,726,4.76984126984127
