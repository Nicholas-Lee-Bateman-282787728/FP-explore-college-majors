8462748,5,B0059676AM,The two Mendelssohn Symphonies are both delights. The Italian Symphony is a little bit better known than the Scottish Symphony. Conductor Munch is terrific. I really think it is great when he accidentally drops his baton but recovers it masterfully in the Scottish Symphony. He is very in synch with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.,1449964800,,330,5.12962962962963
8462749,4,B0059676AM,"A big thank you to ICA Classics for making these wonderful DVDs available of historic music performances, in particular the series devoted to the BSO and Charles Munch.  Munch was at his best in Mendelssohn, and these are performances of exceptional vigor and lan.  What's more, Munch is a delight to watch with his mischievous smile and extroverted baton technique (at one point in the Scottish symphony he conducts so energetically he loses his baton momentarily!).  Sound quality is a bit harsh and the B&W image quality is mediocre at best.  And I do wish these were better value for the money (surely ICA could combine some of these Munch releases - 60 minutes is paltry timing for a DVD, and unnecessary). Nevertheless these are important releases for music buffs to support. Highly recommended.",1328745600,3,801,4.955223880597015
