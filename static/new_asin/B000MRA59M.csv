2742507,5,B000MRA59M,"There has been much criticism by other reviewers with regards to this movie and I want to start of my review by saying that I found this movie to be truly inspiring.  Take away the true ""cuteness"" between Will Smith - the main  character - and his son, who is also his real life son.  Take away Smith's great acting skills (Note: he has come a far way from ""The Prince of Bel-Air"").  Take also away the good camera movement and the editing.  What you are left with is a story of a man who despite his social standing, his nonsupporting wife, his skin color, his education, his age and his lack of ""luck"" goes after what he wants.  And Smith's character does not just go after it, he pursues it.  He puts all his effort, all his time and all his strength into building a better life for himself and his son.

The story is obvious from the beginning, but nonetheless, the viewer is drawn in and is rooting for the underdog.  We applaud his persistence when he goes after the head of HR at a large company, demanding an in-person interview to be accepted into a apprenticeship position.  We are cheering at his ingenuity when instead of listening to his trainer to move from the bottom of a calling sheet, he immediately goes to the top.  We are amazed about his sincerity when he goes to someone's house to apologize for being late.

What is important to note is that Smith's character is rarely seen to use government services for help.  We never see him using food stamps and he only at the very end stays at a local shelter.  Smith's character is a man who uses his wits, his determination and his drive to move himself into a position that in the end will allow him to build the life that he envisions for himself and his son.

I highly recommend this movie for families with teenagers, who will benefit greatly from such an uplifting story.  The lesson here is that the American dream does not just have to be a dream, but that hard work and persistence will make it a reality.",1166659200,,1980,4.368852459016393
2742508,2,B000MRA59M,"""You're a good poppa"", Christopher (Jaden Smith, son of Will & Jada Smith) says to his father, Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Yeeeoooowwwccchhhh! Excuse me for a moment; I need to inject some insulin before the diabetic shock from the treacle dialogue takes hold.

Okay, thanks for holding on. I'm all better.

Well, I'm sure to get some negative hits at Amazon, after I post this review, but here it goes...

Chris Gardner (Smith), the struggling father of a small boy, Christopher (Smith), struggles to sell pieces of medical equipment no doctor seems to want, struggles to get his kid to a third rate, but cheap daycare, and struggles to maintain a home with his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), who works double shifts in a hotel laundry. He just struggles. Chris eventually loses one of the medical devices and this is the last straw for Linda, who walks out. Unable to pay the rent, Chris and his son are evicted and they move into a seedy motel in the Mission district of San Francisco. Chris watches a man park his expensive car at the curb and learns the man is a stockbroker at Dean Witter. Hounding the head of personnel, Jay Twistle (Brian Howe), Chris eventually wins an interview and soon lands an internship with the prestigious brokerage. An unpaid internship. While he works through the competitive internship, Chris sets out to sell the remaining medical devices, to support him and his son, providing their only source of income. Only one in the class of twenty will be hired so it's a struggle. As Chris tries to keep his son safe and fed, he studies his manual, tries to sell the machines, and tries to impress his bosses. Will Chris Gardner be able to overcome the struggle?

""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (yes, I know Microsoft, it is misspelled), directed by Gabriele Muccino, starring Will Smith and his real son, Jaden, is ""inspired by"" the real story of Chris Gardner.

""Happyness"" is the perfect film for this time of year. Designed to provide a brief respite for all of the mall shoppers, give them a bit of fluff, between checkout lines at the Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch, and give them a little inspiration before they trudge out to deal with the next store employee who has had one too many customers like you today. I'm sure some people will be moved and some people will be inspired, it is difficult to not be moved when Gardner finally gets the job at Dean Witter. Oh, I'm not spoiling anything. Even if you didn't already know this, they would never make a film about someone who didn't get the job. That is what the film is about, persevering beyond the struggles. Maybe you'll come out of the film with that extra little oomph in your step, ready to face your own struggles with holiday woes.

But ""Happyness"" is so much more than a little piece of fluff. It is a very calculated move by Smith to get an Oscar nomination. If he tells you otherwise, he is lying. Smith is a movie star and commands a top salary for every film. He can open any film, good or bad, because he has legions of fans willing to pay to see any film he is in. Heck, he can open ""The Pursuit of Happyness"", making it the number one film for the weekend. But he, like every actor, isn't content with simply appearing in box office fluff. Right before this film, there was a trailer for Adam Sandler's next film ""Reign Over Me"", in which he plays a depressed widower who meets up with an old college chum (Don Cheadle). Sandler and Smith are remarkably similar. If Sandler appears in a silly comedy, the film is box office gold. If Smith appears in a sci fi comedy or an action film, box office gold. But both want respectability and the way to achieve that is to make films like ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""Reign Over Me"". These films show they can act, become something other than their popular on screen persona. Sandler has been dipping his toes in this pool for a while, making films like ""Punch Drunk Love"" and ""Spanglish"" along with his more sophomoric comedies.

So, going in, we already know the outcome of ""Happyness"", which means there is no suspense. The only point in watching the film is to watch the struggle. And Gardner struggles. No doubt about that. As the voice over narration states, he signs over his life savings to buy these machines, the medical devices no doctor seems to want. He loses his car, because he has a problem with parking tickets, so he has to carry them all over the Bay Area. He has to make sure he can pick up his son on time. He has to count every penny, to make sure he can feed his son. And more. When the money starts to run out, they are kicked out of their apartment. Then the slide downward continues.

But Chris can't let this affect him, as it would most. He has a son to look after. So he signs up for the internship. As he deals with all of these other problems, he also has to study and learn all about his new job. ""Pursuit"" piles on the challenges and the few moments Chris is able to spend with his young son are filled with moments of ""divine insight"". Chris imparts one helpful comment after another, determined his son will not suffer the same mistakes he has made. ""Don't let anyone tell you you can't do something.""

The problem with ""Pursuit"" is two-fold. Because there is not suspense about whether he will get the job, we must be content with the depiction of the struggle. And how he struggles. One obstacle after another is thrown at him. This presents the second problem. Chris Gardner is so saintly, his character has no evolution or change at all. He starts out a good father and ends the film as a good father. He is a saint and the film knows it. At one point, when Chris and Christopher are sleeping in a homeless shelter run by a church, `poppa' moves to a darkened corner to work on his last medical device; the device is broken and he needs to fix it before he can sell it. When he manages to fix it, a brilliant white light emanates from the machine and the film moves away to a long shot, to show the light emanating from Chris' center, the center of his very being. If you look at the poster for this film, you may notice that a light obscures where Smith is holding his son's hand. Chris is a martyr who will do anything for the betterment of his son's life.

Every year, a number of fine actors and actresses are nominated for an Academy Award. If you do a survey, you will find that an inordinate amount of these nominations went to actors who portray handicapped people of one type or another. And a large number of winners have played these roles. It also helps if a pretty or handsome actor takes on the role, to `show their range'. In ""Pursuit"", Chris Gardner has a handicap of sorts; a phenomenal lack of good decision making skills. From marrying Linda and having a son with her, to spending his life savings on the medical devices, from asking a hippie to safeguard one of the machines while he has an interview, to chasing a homeless man through BART to retrieve one of those heavy medical devices, Chris never makes the right decision. Yet, he perseveres. And the moment when Chris gets the job with Dean Witter is an emotional one. Maybe Smith does deserve a nomination for making this performance work.

""Pursuit"" doesn't seem to believe anyone has more than one facet to their character. Chris is good. Linda is bad. Thandie Newton's Linda does nothing but complain, act sullen, put out and annoyed, grudgingly kissing her son and husband. Believe me, she has every right to be this way, but because Chris is so saintly, we look at Linda as a shrew. She has to work two shifts? Look at how this man has struggled to sell these machines all over the Bay Area, lugging the heavy machines on multiple buses and through crowded BART trains. How dare she complain, even though Chris created the problem by not paying his parking tickets. When she walks out, the film wants us to have no sympathy for her, Chris is the saint in this picture and he must have the sympathy.

All of the people who Chris comes into contact with are either good or meant to provide comic relief. He has an encounter with a hippy and another with a crazy homeless man, but all of the partners at Dean Witter are supportive and encouraging. Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer and many other characters on ""The Simpsons"") plays Alan Frakesh, the office manager who runs the intern training program. Chris becomes his errand boy and Alan unknowingly threatens some of the deals Chris is working on. But this character goes nowhere. Because he `unknowingly' threatens these deals, he is still `good'. And he doesn't provide enough comic relief to make the role interesting.

Jaden Smith is okay as Christopher. He's no Tatum O'Neal, but he's not as precocious as some child actors. Most of his scenes require him to do little more than display one emotion, and he does this well. In some, he is mopey, in others, happy. Hopefully, his adult life won't mirror the daughter of Ryan O'Neal's either.

""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is meant to be an inspiring holiday tale, designed to move people to tears as they watch Chris Gardner's struggle. But it is such a calculated piece of filmmaking that it was difficult for me to watch. It doesn't help that many of the moments between Chris and Christopher are punctuated by dialogue that seems ingested from every single self help book ever written. Hopefully, Dr. Phil is getting a royalty.

I cry when I watch ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition"" and ""Pursuit"" didn't move me that much.",1166572800,11,9492,4.523310023310024

2742511,5,B000MRA59M,"""The Pursuit Of Happyness"" is excellent! Will Smith (who also served as a producer on the film) (as Chris Gardner) gives the best performance (and recently, Golden Globe-nominated) of his career yet and the scenes with him and his son, played ironically, by his real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, are beautifully well-done. The directing by Gabriele Muccino is excellent. The story and screenplay by Steve Conrad (who also wrote ""The Weather Man"" (2005), which is also based on Gardner's real-life autobiography, is excellent. The music by Andrea Guerra (who was Golden Globe nominated for Best Original Song for ""Hotel Rwanda"" (2004) is excellent. The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who is also doing the cinematography to the upcoming ""3:10 To Yuma"" (2007) is excellent. The film editing by Hughes Winborne (who won the Oscar for his work on ""Crash"" (2005) is excellent. The casting by Denise Chamian (who, recently did the casting to ""Deja Vu"" (2006) is excellent. The production design by J. Michael Riva (who is also doing the production design to the upcoming ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) & ""Iron Man"" (2008) is excellent. The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who is also doing the set decoration to the upcoming ""Iron Man"" (2008) is excellent. The costume design by Sharen Davis (who also did the costume design to ""Dreamgirls"" (2006) is excellent. Will Smith has never been better in his performance as Chris Gardner, a sure-fire Oscar nomination for his performance.",1166227200,,1484,5.161825726141079
2742512,4,B000MRA59M,"If anyone has viewed the respective talk shows over the past few weeks, he or she is familiar with the story of Chris Gardner, a down-on-his-luck father that overcame overwhelming odds to become an established stockbroker and successful businessman in his own right.  It is story that has been vividly brought to the screen with a dynamic and heart-wrenching performance from star Will Smith and a poignant acting debut from the actor's real-life son, Jaden.  Both father and son play so well off each other that it was indeed a stroke of genius for such a casting coup.

Thandie Newton continues to deliver memorable turns as she assays the role of Gardner's wife Linda who abandons both husband and son for the chance of a better life in New York, miles away from their San Francisco location.

Speaking of ""the city by the bay,"" it continues to be one of the most appealing locations and director Gabriele Muccino takes advantage of this fact, always making sure that the audience sees notable landmarks in the background.

In a movie of this type, where the ""saccharine level"" could be very high, Muccino keeps them at a minimum, only showing three scenes that start the tear ducts to do their jobs.  This is a tribute to his skills as a director.

Andrea Guerra's score is never overpowering, always effectively subtle to coincide with the on-screen events.

In all, ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is one film that should be pursued by all moviegoers.",1166227200,3,1452,4.803212851405623
2742513,4,B000MRA59M,"SPOILERS, SPOILERS, and, yes, more SPOILERS.

Stockbroker Chris Gardner's real life rags-to-riches story was featured in a 15 minute segment on 20/20 some years ago and it was memorable and inspirational enough that, now, we have THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, a film based, more or less, on that story. Now, certain facts have been altered a bit, ostensibly, for better dramatic consumption. Three examples of changes that were wrought are: back in 1981, Chris actually had custody of his infant son, not a five year old; instead of being unpaid, he did receive a meager stipend in his brokering internship; and Chris's wife Linda is fully fictionalized in the film. Whether such changes work or are even needed is, of course, left for you to decide. What's not up to debate is the quality of man it takes to pull off an underdog story like this. The real Chris Gardner must've been (and, presumably, still is) a formidably resilient man who made his own luck, who remained undeterred by a life that was kicking him to the curb.

The film's plot: THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS (The misspelled ""happyness"" originates from an outside mural displayed on the crappy Chinatown day care center to which Chris sends his son) is set in 1981, in San Francisco. Go-getter Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who had been an excellent student as a child but who now, as an adult, feels he's basically amounted to nothing, is eking out a hand-to-mouth living as an unsuccessful hawker of a hospital equipment called a bone density scanner, which proves to be a flop with the medical community. With a young 5 year old and an increasingly bitter wife to provide for, it's tough going for Chris. In fact, it's his wife Linda (a worn down, shrewish Thandie Newton), who toils in multiple shifts and, more often than not, furnishes the capital. Linda finds this lifestyle too unbearable and soon takes off for New York. Upon the insistence of Chris, she reluctantly leaves their son Christopher (Jaden Smith) in his care. Bye bye, Linda.

Chris has a plan. A few scenes back, a fleeting encounter with a friendly stockbroker sporting a red Ferrari - who informed him that all one needed to have success in stocks was to be ""good with people and good with numbers"" - had impacted him enough  that he had decided to become a stockbroker himself. A month of persistence (or, basically, politely hounding an executive outside his brokerage building and then impressing him with his Rubik's Cube skills) lands him an interview for a prospective 6-month internship program with the prestigious Dean Witter firm, with the possibility of being hired at internship's end. He passes the interview and is offered a spot in the program, despite showing up dressed like a transient (a long story, involving paint, parking tickets, and prison). However, to his dismay, he finds that it is an unsalaried internship; after some long, hard thinking, he decides to still go for it, while re-dedicating himself to selling more of his bone density scanners to make ends meet.

Of course, things go bad immediately. With his wife and her steady income gone, Chris struggles badly. He runs afoul of the landlord, the IRS, and, in one kinda funny sequence, of one dogged taxi driver. He does manage to sell a scanner, only to have his finances subsequently confiscated by the IRS. Down to literally mere dollars, he and his son succumb to poverty and become homeless; they find themselves forced to wait in line for hours to get into homeless shelters and, when not getting in the shelter, having to spend nights in public rest rooms. Meanwhile, during the day, Chris dons his business attire and attends his internship. He finds it difficult to compete with the other 19 aspirers in the program as they manage to put in 9 hours daily, whereas he's only able to spend 6 hours in the firm (he has to pick up his son from day care, catch the bus, get in line for the shelter, etc). To compensate, while in the firm, he doesn't drink water (thus, less time in the bathroom) and keeps the phone constantly in hand (discovering he gains 8 minutes by doing so). As the 6 months of internship continue to elapse, things get progressively worse for the Gardner family. And then the last day of internship comes...

I won't lie, it's a pretty dark, gloomy film; but there's a beauty and a sincerity to it. THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is imbued with a certain stark honesty, depicting Chris' struggles as he copes with his internship while simultaneously walking that tightrope between life on and off the streets. This film is sentimental without being too cloying and contains enough levity to thankfully provide a much-needed counterpoint to the main character's dreary, ever worsening plight.

I truly enjoyed this film. It's 180 degrees away from the normal, breezy Will Smith flick. Although he's done serious cinema in the past, he's never put as much of his soul and his heart as he does in this one. It's evident that PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a personal project of his. One reason for his emotional investment is, undeniably, the casting of young Christopher, unaffectedly portrayed by Jaden Smith, who happens to be Will Smith's real life son. Their natural chemistry is what makes this whole shebang works. The bond between the two is a delight to behold. If there's any doubt that Will Smith is genuinely a nice guy, his sweet, easy relationship with his son should dispel any doubt, if there were any, to begin with. Young Jaden Smith is a fresh, new talent who is effectively unmannered in his acting and also delivers with some pretty good kid jokes.

I've never had any doubts that the Fresh Prince can act. He proved that early on in SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION. Will Smith was also great in ALI, and he is equally charismatic here as he unveils a focused commitment to dramatic acting. Once again, his innate likability holds him in good stead. There are moments in the film where he'll make you positively weep. Witness his performance as he and Christopher are forced to spend a night in a BART station men's room, or the fleeting look of bleakness which crosses his face when he's forced to relinquish his last five dollar bill to loan his boss cab fare, and, brilliantly depicted, the held-in-check emotions he displays in the movie's culminating moments when he finds out he just got hired (c'mon, you did know he was gonna get the gig, right?). I wouldn't be at all surprised if an Oscar nomination is in the offing.

So what else can I say to convince folks to check this film out? This movie is fairly stark without being patronizing, hopeful without being saccharine. Yes, there are several patented Hollywood moments (how could there not?), but these are curtailed by Smith's awesomely gritty performance. His protagonist is a man of big smarts whose dignity, optimism, perseverance, resilience, and love for his son never flag. Chris Gardner realizes, too, that resorting to bitterness and anger isn't the answer. Instead, throughout his travails, he maintains his composure, his wits, his smile, and his warmth, qualities which inevitably carry him to the summit. This movie is emotional, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting. I'm so glad I saw it.",1166227200,4,7209,4.811945117029863

What kept this movie alive was the warmth and enthusiasm of Will Smith.  Never have I seen him so emotionally involved in his character.  Thinking about each scene there wasn,t one that I can remember without him.  He must have been exhausted. This movie did bring to light what it is like to be broke and homeless.

Moments when you are the edge of your seat, just aching at the possibility that something else could go wrong, wondering how they will deal with it.

But this week, I figured, if other people have the courage to actually face being homeless with a child, how could I not have the courage to sit in my living room and watch a movie about it?  Homelessness is such a huge problem in our country right now. And people who are in this struggle don't need our sympathy, they need our empathy, and for us to hope with them like we do with the characters in this film.

The soundtrack is well done, all the performances are great, and in the end, of course, it is a film about fatherhood as well as about pursuing happiness.",1512259200,3,949,4.380681818181818

The Founders who wrote that the pursuit of happiness is an unalienable right, gave their fortunes to win it. The end, that the pursuit of happiness is the pursuit of money, that the cure to unhappiness is unbridled greed, is really sad. These people need therapy. I also found the story inauthentic. A lot of support mechanisms are available to homeless people in NYC. Of course, he used those resources but they left out that part to manipulate the viewer.",1511654400,2,744,4.775193798449612

Though the book is no longer fresh in my head, this movie stirred up the same thoughts of respect on both how much a survivor Mr. Gardner is and what a trooper his son is.  In this current era of political battling, it's nice to say that this movie didn't push any kind of agenda either way, so if a potential viewer is worried about that, don't be.  Lastly, it was great seeing Will Smith in a role that sees him depart from the character traits that are found in many of his roles.

I don't want to put any spoilers in this, but despite the title it's not a feel good or happy movie for the majority of the picture. Will Smith does such an incredible job of acting in this movie that you feel his pain so acutely as he perseveres to make something of his life and provide for his five-year old son, with the threatening grasp of hunger and homelessness always tapping them on the back. Important life lessons and much food for thought in this movie. Highly recommended.",1503100800,2,758,4.382978723404255

2742997,4,B000MRA59M,"With a title like The Pursuit of Happiness, you expect the characters to get to the promised land. They do, but if the journey matters more than the destination, this is a movie to skip. The Pursuit of Happyness is long, dull, and depressing. It expands into two hours a story that could have been told more effectively in one. This is not the feel-good movie of the season unless you believe that a few moments of good cheer can redeem 110 minutes of gloom. Sitting through The Pursuit of Happiness is a chore. Downbeat movies aren't inherently bad (in fact, many are powerful), but this one provides artificial characters in contrived circumstances.

2743034,5,B000MRA59M,"There are ways to approach certain situations that certainly might make you struggle or to completely struggle with a downfall. Some people may think they are struggling because they cant find a ride to work while some people are struggling to find a job to keep a shelter over them and their families. Warning, I will spill a little of the movie if you haven't watched this but I won't spoil the end. Will Smith plays a role called, Chris Gardner, pursuing life with the struggles that hits him and his family creating himself a single father in the 2006 film, The Pursuit of Happyness, rated PG 13. Based on a true story, Chris shows the utmost bravery and ambition through living in homeless shelters, public restrooms, and train stations with his 5 year old son, Christopher. His biggest motivation is his son although he didn't have a consistent job, selling old technical devices called Bone Density Scanner hoping that he would make sales for meals and a place to stay for him and his son. Through his journey with the duration of 6 months, he stays strong and still has high hopes that itll all pay off. This movie demonstrates a great way to view obstacles in life and how to approach them with hard work ethics and staying true to oneself. We can be inspired with our own motives just like how Chris was with his work and his son.

Chris was a hard working father. He still managed to keep his son in school and daycare although they couldn't find money to pay their rent. His wife left him, lost his bank accounts, and credit cards. Yet, he was so positive and tried so hard to keep his son happy and safe by telling his son stories, going to adventures when he was actually working trying to sell his scanners, and buying meals when he did make sales. His other job was being a stockbroker but wasn't getting any pay until he was keeping up after 6 months of training. After all of this hard work, he still hopes that it will all pay off although he was doubted by some of his peers and his wife that left him.

I absolutely love this movie, it is one of my all time favorites. It did catch my attention as soon as I started watching because it will give its audience a sense of empathy and sympathy for Chris. With Will Smiths son, Jayden Smith playing the role of the 5 year old son, no one would want to miss out on the father-son movie. Whenever Chris was torn and crying, his son will try to lift him back up. There was a scene when Christopher said he gives up and was going ballistic because he wanted to go back home but Chris would tell him no! You can be anything and you can do anything that you want. The uplifting acts between the two warmed my heart and gave me hope in todays humanity and hopefulness.

I believe that anyone and everyone should give this movie a shot because it is heartfelt and will give your eyes and few tears and a bunch of warm smiles throughout the entire movie. I didn't regret it and everyone else that I recommended this movie to loved this movie as well. If you want to watch a sentimental and very inspiring movie, I highly recommend The Pursuit of Happyness.",1486339200,,3114,4.374784110535406

2743119,5,B000MRA59M,"Chris (Will Smith): Dont ever let somebody tell you you cant do something. Not even me. All right?

Christopher (Jaden Smith): All right.

Chris: You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People cant do somethin themselves, they wanna tell you you cant do it. If you want somethin, go get it. Period.

I have to confess that I have a big crush on Will Smith, an actor and rapper who I find super sexy, nice, funny, and cool. Ive recently bought many of his movies and albums. I am only now discovering, together with my kids, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (Yes, I didn't watch it in the 90s!). So, I bought this movie just because Will is in it. And I was blown away by the movie.

The Pursuit of Happyness (yes, with a Y: thats because of a misspelled graffiti on the wall of Christophers depressing  day-care) is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film  is touching, surprising, sad and funny. The Pursuit of Happyness will break your heart and will make you value what you have. But this is not a depressing movie. It is a movie about hope, love, survival, fatherhood, and about never giving up your dreams.

The Pursuit of Happyness is based on a true story: the story of Chris Gardner and his struggle for a decent life while keeping his son next to him at all times. The real Chris Gardner was present throughout the shooting and discussed several things with Will and director Gabriele Muccino.

Will Smith was nominated for an Oscar for his breathtaking performance of Chris Gardner. Thats definitely one of the best performances of Wills career (if not the best), together with his stunning portrayals of Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001) and Dr. Bennet Omalu in Concussion (2015).

Chris Gardner first thought that Will was miscast to play him, but his daughter Jacintha told him: If Smith can play Muhammad Ali, he can play you!.

Jaden Smiths performance is also amazing. He wasn't cast in the film right away. Director Gabriele Muccino saw some 250 kids and he said that they were all cute and fine. The problem was that Muccino wasn't looking for a cute and fine little boy, but for a little boy who could be real. After a week, Muccino asked Will if his son Jaden could read for him, and, when he did, Muccino was amazed. The love that father and son have for each other in real life can be definitely felt in the movie. Jaden, who portrays a 5 year old Christopher, was 8 years old when the movie was shot and released. The real Christopher (Chris Gardners son), however, was just a baby at the time of the real events.

The best: Wills brilliant performance, the toilet scene, Wills running, Jadens fresh performance, and the board room scene towards the end of the movie.

The worst: nothing.",1482624000,,2708,4.504081632653061

I had never heard of him or his story until I found out he would be speaking at this conference so we watched this film the night before. It was very moving and inspiring. Just now when I watched it on Amazon I experienced all of the feelings and memories of that time in my life, chasing a dream, discovering what I'm capable of and taking risks and chances daily. The first time I saw the movie I had not yet been through any significant hardship so I was inspired by this story and hearing the man himself tell his story in person was outstanding. Just now watching this 9 years later, I was so moved and impacted because I have experience many of the financial struggles of having no where to live, no money or ongoing income and just trying to survive day to day to get by. At the same time trying to maintain dignity, confidence and hope. I have overcome as well and while not a millionaire like Chris, I am in a good place and pursuing my own happiness.  I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. If you read about his story before hand it will help toward the end of the film as it seems things couldn't get any worse.  Will Smith did an excellent job playing this role and so did his real life son playing his son in the movie.  Also check out the very end when they are walking down that street and Chris Gardner himself makes a cameo and walks past them.",1478908800,2,1492,4.228070175438597

I was very happy that this film never got political and blamed Reagan for the number of ""down on their luck"" people that were shown, nor was the race card ever pulled out. It was also refreshing that Smith's character never blamed anybody for his troubles.
It's very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama. In no ways is it clich or contrived or boring. Let's just say that's it not Oliver Stone dramatic. This truly is a must see. To say ""I laughed, I cried"" would be really lame. It is the truth, though.
We know that Scorsese's crowning achievement ""The Departed"" is going to take the cake at the Oscars, and I won't be complaining. But this movie deserves to be experienced and taken in by the masses.",1474243200,,973,4.3812154696132595

Because his enthusiasm and can-do attitude was so infectious, he ingratiated, endeared himself to new acquaintances and it opened doors for him. The true story begins in 1981 in San Francisco. Chris was barely scraping by, he owed $650 in back taxes to the IRS, was three months behind in rent, and his wife Linda abandoned him. His life was wrapped up in his 5-year-old son Christopher; his life revolved around Christopher. His primary goal was to ensure that Christopher was not handicapped by his impoverished living conditions. His interactions with Christopher were gratifying and the highlight of his day. Christopher, too young to be aware of their precarious predicament, allowed the father to view the situation through his son's eyes. Brief rewarding moments of diversion and escapism from the harsh realities of the present, making it all worthwhile.",1464566400,,988,5.18125

There is some swearing, but it doesn't feel ""thrown in"" for entertainment value. The themes and script are the main focus. There is the f word once. It is when the little 5 year old son asks his dad about the spelling of it as graffiti. Just warn your kids.",1459209600,,478,4.431818181818182

2743788,2,B000MRA59M,"This movie is about a man, down on his luck, who eventually gets a break. If you read the book, you'll know that not only was Chris Gardner a man who was always down on his luck, but he was also a man who overcame adversity with his strong will and cunning intelligence.
The reason for the two stars is because this movie took 50 pages from the book that Chris Gardner wrote himself about his life story and turned it into a 2 hour movie. It gives nothing to how Chris got to that point, nor how hard he had to work to get out of that scenario. No credit is given to the people who helped him get to where he is today, or how great of a man he eventually became. If you want to watch a two hour movie about a sad man and a the sad state of his life, and just be all around sad, you'll love it.

But -- maybe I was jetlagged and just didn't gauge the time well -- I only saw half the movie before the entertainment was turned off due to our landing!  I got home and was DYING to see the rest, and was not disappointed.  Of course, great just by the fact that you have Will Smith AND his son, Jaden, and the natural father-son chemistry that's there, and greater yet that it's a true story.  Yeah, the tissue was needed.  And yeah, Hollywood style happy ending.  But you know what?  It's a REAL happy ended, that REALLY happened.

2743890,5,B000MRA59M,"""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a simple inspirational movie. It is not pretty actors,no fancy pictures,no touching music,but can also attract you read on law-abiding,because it has good enough story,plain but not mediocre.  movie talking about a salesman Chris Gardner back in the 1980s that holds a big dream for his family and himself; however, this beautiful dream did not come true. Chris Gardner is a bright and talented, but marginally employed salesmanfinally, he succeeded. I want to say, this movie does inspire me a lot. What impressed me most are: Chris' wife left him because of life pressure; Chris' love to his son and Chris' strong belief towards life. Through these, I know that it is not easy to be a good husband and a good Papa, since in reality, only love cannot only make everything. And I also learn that one has to strongly believe in himself, no matter how difficult the situation is, but of course, hard-working is indispensable.",1441065600,,953,4.882716049382716

However, once I feel down and I am giving up of my future dreams I watch this movie. It show us hoe we should fight to get what we really want to achieve for our future no matter what we lose or who we lose. I think we all should this movie many times and Im sure that every times we watch it we will feel its like the first time. We can see in this movie that when we have really hard time in our life the end will be happy but we shouldnt give up of what we believe. On the other hand, I think we should also teach our children how they should achieve what they love not what we love as what Will Smith told his son in the movie, it was one of the most motivated part in the movie.

2744049,5,B000MRA59M,"I have been wanting to see the Pursuit of Happyness film since around 2006/2007 when I was living on the Mayport Naval base in Florida. Im glad that I finally got the chance to see this motivational film that also had equal moments of heart string pulling and tear jerking scenes. As many know, Pursuit of Happyness stars Will Smith as Chris Gardner and Smiths real-life son Jaden Smith as the child. Thandie Newton also is one of the celebrities included in the film.  One of the heart string pulling scenes is where the character of Chris Gardner and his son are shown waiting along with what looks to be several hundred other people waiting in line for homeless housing, but the shelter could only house around 50 people (an indirect commentary on the number of homeless shelters available in the U.S.). One of the employees of the homeless shelter is seen having to do the difficult job of announcing to the many waiting that they have now reached their daily cutoff, leaving the obvious impression that others are going to have to try elsewhere and/or again the next day.  On an unrelated note, I especially cant help but have feeling around this issue after unexpectedly running into a female who was homeless (less than a year ago), but was at least happy to have got a spot at a nearby homeless shelter and a job as an event planning assistant even as she was trying to qualify for public housing (which was obviously going to be a possible but tricky feat for her because she appeared to be both childfree and single). I only say that because it is common knowledge that the circumstances and probability of being able to qualify for public housing are different for those who have children compared to those who voluntarily chose to not have children. Without revealing her identity, the only other thing I feel comfortable in disclosing is that it appeared to me that she had previously actually lived in D.C., based on what she told me and where I ran into her (I wish to avoid disclosing for the sake of the review and my conscience on what is ok to reveal about that encounter). The ending of the Pursuit of Happyness gives the following data; After beginning his career at Dean Witter, Chris Gardner went on to open the investment firm Gardner Rich in 1987.  Chris Gardner himself then makes a brief appearance in the film. Then the following other info; In 2006, Chris Gardner sold a minority stake in his brokerage firm in a multi-million dollar deal.",1432339200,,2468,4.63013698630137
2744050,5,B000MRA59M,Great,1432339200,,5,5.0
2744051,5,B000MRA59M,"The Pursuit of Happyness is a *tremendously* moving film.  It's about Will Smith and his real-life son who find themselves homeless after many struggles, and Will Smith does everything in his power to get both of them out of the rut they're in.  He's willing to work extra hard in his stockbroker training program and fast-moving hectic salesman routine to make a stronger impression on his boss/workmates all in an attempt to get them away from the dreaded world of the homeless shelter they eventually find themselves staying in a result of never having the money to pay their rent.

Some things were never clear to me however.  One, why did the wife/mother suddenly leave?  She seemed perfectly normal and responsible to me.  Unless she had a secret side that Will's character was aware of that indicated otherwise, it seemed like the only problem she had was not making sense by suddenly announcing she was leaving one day.  I think it'd be better if the movie touched on her emotional state some more.  I obviously get that she wanted something more than to spend time with a husband who struggles finding work and thus struggles with enough money to support his wife and son, but she never indicated she was really upset until the sudden announcement that she was leaving.  I expected more on this subject to be mentioned.

Also, what was up with those boxes Will was carrying around?  They looked like pet cages and people around the streets of San Francisco were so fascinated with them in their belief that they were actually time machines (usually older folks who were once hippies- yeah you know where this is going) that they'd occasionally steal and try to run away with them, hence all the segments where Will's running after these people trying to retrieve them.  Turns out these pet cage-looking things are portable bone-density scanners.

Otherwise Will Smith's character is really fantastic.  He doesn't appear to have any side problems such as a drug or alcohol addiction or a crime record, which to me means he shouldn't have struggled as much as he did.  But this *is* based on a true story after all, so maybe I'm underestimating how difficult it was to find a steady job in San Francisco in the early 80's (the time period which this movie was based on).  I really felt a TON of emotion for Will and wanted him to succeed because it was getting really desperate and uncertain at times.  Will would always make a strong impression that he was intelligent, hence the rubix's cube segment with a workmate where he was able to figure it out in seconds.  Hilarious when he ran away from the taxi driver because he didn't want to pay, and the taxi driver went ballistic chasing after him.  I never saw a taxi driver act THAT angry before!  Again, I'm a country guy so maybe this behavior is perfectly normal.

Overall this movie will touch your emotional state.  When Will has to constantly hide the fact he's homeless from his workmates and cover it up with lies (sometimes hilariously, such as a shirtless/pants joke he makes when trying to make a strong impression on one occasion) and when Will and his son find themselves at the absolute low point by sleeping in a bathroom after getting kicked out of their hotel, you really feel for him.  Someone as polite as Will's character with a 5-year old struggling the way he was makes you really wish you could help them out.  That's a sign of strong characters and storyline, so the Pursuit of Happyness is a classic film.  I won't spoil the ending, but it'll make you smile.",1432166400,,3542,4.674193548387096

2744091,5,B000MRA59M,"THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS takes place in San Francisco, with about equal time given to a run down area in Chinatown and to upscale environment in the nearby financial district.  Please note that, aside from the main street in Chinatown, Grant Avenue, many of nearby side streets are somewhat run down.  The run down areas extend for only one or two blocks, to the east and to the west, of Grant Avenue.  The main characters include Will Smith, his young son, his wife, and a hiring manager at a financial firm, played by Brian Howe.

Will Smith's job is to sell bone scanners.  During much of the movie, Will Smith is shown toting a box resembling a typical box that contains a Singer sewing machine.  The film shows Will Smith visiting various doctor's offices, attempting to gain a sale.  We learn that he needs to sell two bone scanner machines per month, in order to break even.  Will Smith's wife has a job too, but it is a humble laundry worker job.  In the opening moments of the movie, we see Will Smith in his neighborhood, accompanied by his son.  Graffiti decorates the outside walls of the businesses on the side streets in Chinatown, and we see an area with the F-word, and next to that is the word, HAPPYNESS. Will Smith asks the owner of the business, an elderly Chinese man, to remove the graffiti, because it is not appropriate.  But the man is not responsive to Will Smith's request.  In a couple of other scenes, we see Will Smith dropping his son off at a daycare center, which is run by an old Chinese woman.  Will Smith requests that the woman discontinue her behavior in exposing the children to television programs, and instead engage in, for example, reading stories or teaching games.  The old Chinese woman disagrees, and resists this suggestion.  These features of the plot line establish that Will Smith is a caring parent who has the goal of acting responsibly.

ROADBLOCKS. Don't worry, I do not give away the ending.  In fact, I will only disclose the many roadblocks that occur in the course of Will Smith's occupation as a bone scanner salesman, and in his quest to gain entry to an internship to become a stockbroker.

(1) On the visit to one medical doctor, the bone scanner does not work.

(2) During his initial visit to the financial firm, when he wishes to apply for a job, Will Smith leaves his bone scanner in the care of a hippie girl who is playing guitar on the sidewalk.  But the hippie girl steals the bone scanner, and disappears in the subway, that is, in Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART).

(3) A nutty man, with long scraggly hair, believes that the bone scanner is a time machine, and he steals one of the bone scanners.

(4) Will Smith's wife has a humble job in a laundry, but the income enables the family to pay most of the bills.  The wife has no faith that Will Smith will every be able to support the family, and she threatens to move to New York, and that is just what she does.  As was the case in the another movie, Kramer v. Kramer, she abandons her young son.

(5) Will Smith secures a job interview with the financial firm, but the day before, when he is painting his apartment, the police arrive.  The police take him to jail for the night.  His only clothes are a T shirt, old jacket, and blue jeans, and his face is splattered with paint.  The next morning, when he is released from jail, he arrives at his job interview, but does not have time to dress in his usual formal business attire.  Instead, he shows up for the interview in the T shirt, with face splattered with paint.  Will Smith manages to turn this very negative situation into a positive feature of his character, and he does this by an impromptu spiel.

(6) During his internship with the financial firm, Will Smith is invited to a baseball game with a potential client.  The potential client is shown to live in an upper class home, and he offers Will Smith the opportunity to join him in a box seat to see the San Francisco Giants.  Thus, for this ten minute interlude in the movie, it looks as though Will Smith will make a sale.  But then, the potential client exclaims that there is no way that he will ever do business with Will Smith's company, and will not trust this company with his retirement plan.  The refusal is done in a good-natured way, and Will Smith handles the refusal with aplomb and is not fazed.

CONCLUSION.  Basically, this is a film about showing tenacity during a prolonged job hunt, when everything goes wrong.  I only know of one other movie that travels along the same territory, namely, KRAMER v. KRAMER, where Dustin Hoffman loses his job and scrambles to find  a new one.  As is the case with THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, it is the case that the main character has a young son and is dumped by his wife.  In HAPPYNESS, the wife moves from California to New York, and in KRAMER v. KRAMER, the wife moves from the east coast to California.  During essentially all of story, Will Smith manages to stay cool, collected, and professional.  On only one occasion, occurring at about one hour and 17 minutes into the movie, it is the case that Will Smith loses his composure.  This movie will likely be an inspiration to any person who finds himself subjected to that feature of the game of life (not always a rational game), called the job interview",1430179200,,5301,4.482794577685088

2744274,5,B000MRA59M,"The picture of a father and son huddled together at night in the public bathroom at a subway station should strike a hard blow to any viewer. But at the same time, the image of a father and son sticking together even when it requires sleeping in less-than-ideal circumstances should send a powerful message. And truly, The Pursuit of Happyness sends its message loud and clear.

This is Will Smith at the absolute finest Ive seen him. Im sure that acting alongside Jaden helped, but theres still not a moment that I doubt his love or fear. And he gets a lot of good comedy in between.

I like good emotional stories when they're told well, and this is a film that has plenty of heart-tugging moments. Not because its a sad story, its not, but because it is so real. Everything from the performances to the story arc and its perfect progression to almost-despair and back is so believable and real that any viewer should easily connect to the film.

This is a film about hard times and good times. Its a film about losing bets and winning them. A film about never giving up. And most obviously, a film about the love between a father and his son and a mans absolute refusal to let anything else get in the way.

I guess this is what they call a heartwarming tale, and aside from a bit of language, I enjoyed every minute of it.",1420675200,,1326,4.378048780487805

2744320,5,B000MRA59M,"I watched this movie during the Christmas season in the UK. I was borrowed by a friend to keep me going during the christmas period. I was going through the challenging times and moments similar to Chris in the movie and had fear about my career in the new year. It is a movie that encourages one not to give up when trying to pursue one's career especially now that the economy of the country is bad. Tough times never last and where there is life, there is hope. In pursuing one's career, patience and perseverance is necessary. Although, patience is bitter, but the fruit is sweet.

I like to watch movies like this that depicts true life stories. Movies like this helps to build one's hope and hold on to one's dream that one day, one will be an achiever. It is a movie I would recommend for youths and people facing disappointments when searching for job and have to do voluntary jobs or internships. It encourages one to be relentless when pursuing your dream and never give up.",1419292800,,984,4.466666666666667

2744378,4,B000MRA59M,"This is a film about personal success and the struggle over obstacles that prevent it.  It is the story of many who have overcome adversity through perseverance, hard work and some intelligence to beat a system that sometimes one feels that its only purpose is to prevent one from becoming more.  It is not a story unique to Will Smith's character in the film, but one in which reflects how the response to adversity is what really differentiates us as humans.  Will's character could have let him accept the excuses for his failures, but refused to accept those excuses and rose above them to realize excuses did not get him anywhere, but that it would be a bit hard for him to get where he wanted to go.  Overall a good film with good acting, but sometimes presented small obstacles as insurmountable to avoid alienating its viewers who need the excuses.",1417737600,,856,4.6490066225165565

2744481,5,B000MRA59M,"The Pursuit Of Happyness begins as an ordinary movie of a man under pressure to keep his family out of poverty. Will Smith starring as Chris Gardner takes on a role of a struggling man living paycheck to paycheck, selling medical machines doctors only see as a luxury and trying to keep his family afloat. The Pursuit of Happyness gives hope to all of society, delivering a message expressing that through struggle and determination there is a way out of poverty leading to a better life.
  At first The Pursuit of Happyness portrays the typical rags to riches story, but this film is far from it. Chriss troubles go downhill fast as the domino effect began on his life. Chriss life begins to spiral downwards when he fails to pay rent because he cant sell his bone density scanners to doctors. Which in turn foreshadows Chriss wife abandoning their family and the eviction of Chris and his son Christopher. In and out of homeless shelters, struggling to find a safe place for his son, Chris knows something has to be done. One afternoon as Chris is venturing out to hospitals attempting to sell his bone density scanners he begins to find himself admiring all the happy stockbrokers with their fancy cars. Shortly after, Chris applied for an internship at a large stock brokerage firm. Once accepted into the program he begins to intensely pursue the internship for a chance to obtain his dream job as a stockbroker Chris needed to beat out 20 other applicants in order to have a chance.
  The director of this movie Gabriele Muccino enhances the emotions portrayed throughout the film as well as the overall drama with a few tear-jerking scenes that are nothing short of inspiring. As Chris attempted to make his dreams come true for him and his son, his life came to an all time low when he was unable to find a homeless shelter with any vacancy. Chris was forced to lock Christopher and himself in the bathroom of a train station in order to have a safe place to sleep that night. In this scene it began with young Christopher asking Chris where are we going? and Chris replying I don't know you can hear the pain in Chris voice because he feels as though he failed his son by having no place to stay. Chris then uses his creativity and uses his bone density scanner as if it were a time machine helping them travel back in time to the prehistoric age with dinosaurs. Chris tells Christopher they have to get cover and they both run to the bathroom, but this was only a genius disguise by Chris to give them a place to sleep calling the bathroom a cave. Locking the door behind them Chris sits up against the wall as Christopher quickly falls asleep on his fathers lap. As the night slowly passes a loud knocking came to the bathroom door as Chris is holding Christopher tight in his arms putting one foot on the door and one against the wall with tears rushing down his face. This scene is beyond powerful as a grown man hits rock bottom in his rollercoaster of a life.
  The film displays a growing problem in the United States as unemployment rates have increased dramatically in the past 20 years. Its nothing short of amazing how two actors who have never been in poverty can take on such a strong role in this heart wrenching film. As Will Smith is generally seen acting in films that are more comical than dramatic such as Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air and Men in Black, I was skeptical to watch but I was pleasantly proven wrong. Jaden Smith (Will Smiths son) starring as Christopher is a stand out in this film. The acting by Jaden Smith is nothing short of surprising as his life is completely flipped upside down from a life full of luxury in real life to a life of poverty. This motion picture is definitely in my top ten movies of all time simply because of the message the movie portrays, stating that through a hard work ethic and determination the American dream is in an arms reach regardless of your economic background.",1411516800,,3936,4.528832630098453

2744536,5,B000MRA59M,"Actor Will Smith delivers a powerful, heart-wrenching, portrayal of a man who lost everything but his son and his sanity. And, he came very close to losing them  both, as well. Yet, by sheer will-power in meeting his objective, he gained an empire. The one of his own making. In this true-life depiction of rags-to-riches, homelessness and the fact that not everyone who is impoverished and in a shelter due to unemployment is a bum, a junkie, a pimp, a thief, a prostitute, jailbird, lunatic, alcoholic or of the criminal element. For such is the cruel, stereo-type stigma of anyone residing within a shelter or of one being fed from the local soup kitchen, street outreach. It's dehumanizing at best, for the staff at such places, treat the residents with scorn and contempt and as second-class, citizens. And so, the thought and expectation of any lasting good coming from someone whose been in a shelter, is minimal, if any at all. Particularly, with a kid in tow. The theme character is a good-hearted man who, living with the mother of his son, tried to get rich quick by buying into and selling at his own price, portable x-ray machines, door-to-door to medical doctors within the neighborhood. Things went sour. His girlfriend left him. His car was repossessed. He was jobless. He was evicted from his apartment and was yet again, thrown out of the hotel room that he was renting. Because he owed Uncle Sam money, they took it automatically out of his bank account, leaving him flat-broke and on the street, literally. His new haven, was the bathroom floor of a train station. He even resorted to selling his blood and plasma for a few dollars, since his so-called friend that owed him money, refused to pay him back. With so many obstacles one right after the other, you'd think that the man was cursed for supposedly having done all sorts of terrible things. But, he wasn't and didn't. Alone, hurting and depressed, for the first time in his life, he and the local homeless crowd stood in line for a nightly, first-come/first-serve bed, bath and bowl of soup. The only thing that kept him going was the advertisement he saw and enrolled in, for a 6-month, non-paid, internship at a prestigious, stock brokerage firm. The rest is a mountain moving, personal and stock brokerage, miracle. You will cry tears of joy and  relief for a courageous man who beat the odds, and overcame seemingly insurmountable, obstacles. You will cheer for this man's true-life, history-making, colossal, triumph in life and career. And, think to yourself ""...that maybe, just maybe, I can do it, too!"" Inspiring. Convicting. And deeply, moving. Keep the tissue box, handy. Nina Kish",1407628800,,2670,4.8402625820568925

Not character development, no inner struggles, undeveloped story lines with other characters. Extremely Smith-centered.

2744621,5,B000MRA59M,"I wanted to review Will Smiths 2006 film The Pursuit of Happyness, which I just saw last week. To explain why I choose to review this film I must first explain why I avoided it for so long. Happyness was released in 2006, 8 years before this review. I remember the trailers for it back then and I remember thinking ""oh great another rags to riches story this time starring Will Smith, he must be trying to get an Oscar nod. "" After passing on the film for so long I came across a short clip of it on YouTube, it was enough to spark my interest.

The Pursuit of Happyness is not what I expected it to be. Every time I thought I knew where the film was going I was surprised. There was no politics or racial overtones to the film, again not what I expected. The everyday struggle of a man and his young family who are just trying to keep a roof over their heads and food in their bellies is very gritty and realistic.

But the biggest surprise for me was in Will Smiths acting. I never thought of him as a great actor. Good yes, great no. When I watch a Will Smith film I can never fully get into his characters because I never forget that I'm watching Will Smith. I have the same issue with Tom Cruise and even with Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt lately. I immediately forgot that I was watching Will Smith while watching this film, the desperateness in Chris Gardner's situation was present from the opening minutes.

The story never gives way to the stereotypical rags to riches tale. The movie is inspirational not because the guy is going through all of these hard times, but because we see he is trying his best and most of the time his best is not good enough. It echoes Ira Glass and his infamous skill speech. He was already doing his best and not succeeding, only a chance encounter that Mr. Gardner acted upon changed his reality. The film is definitely inspiring for several reasons but that's just the proverbial tip of the iceberg.

I'm sure this film has played in several sociology classes since 2006. The film breaks the mold in several subtle ways. Mr. Gardner is turned away from the women's shelter of which there are numerous in San Francisco to the only shelter where men are allowed. This is an underlying problem in the United States where homeless men are not treated the same as a homeless women. The other issue that was fresh to this film was that Mr. Gardner was a single father, not because his wife died as would be expected but because the child's mother essentially gave up on the family. He was a single African American father at that, this goes against so many stereotypes in American culture regarding the absent fathers in the African American community.

There is so much to learn from a film like this. Never give up on a dream. Don't be lazy even when you are dead tired and have legitimate excuses to be. This was best seen in the scene with Mr. Gardner studying at night by the window. Don't judge a book by its cover. This was best seen in the interview scene when Mr. Gardner is covered in paint, and again when they are invited to the 49er's game.

That's not to say the film is perfect by any means, some of the subplots take up way too much screen time and the film could have shaved at least five to ten minutes off of the run time. This is one of those films that came at the right time and place in my life for me to truly respect what was accomplished in regards to the true story and the film itself. Check it out and leave your expectations at the door.",1400716800,4,3506,4.312594840667678

Good story of good ethics and sacrifice. I wonder why this is not more often used in schools, as it is a great conversation starter of ****SPOILER ALERT***** discussing the actual ethics of self-sacrifice at this level. Is it right or wrong? How has society's views changed over the millenia about self-sacrifice? Is it different during times of war, why or why not? Is this type of sacrifice admired in capitalist society?

The film stayed true to Gardner's struggle for success and love and dedication to his son.  In San Francisco, 1981, Chris Gardner (Will Smith) can't make ends meet selling portable overpriced bone density scanners, while his embittered wife Linda waitresses 2 shifts a day.

Impressed by a man with a sports car on the street one day, Chris asks him what he does for a living. He's a a stock broker. Reluctantly at first, when he learns it's non-paying, Chris joins a competitive Internship training program at Dean Witter. He must be at the top of his class after six months in order to be hired.

Meanwhile pressures continue to mount. He becomes homeless,  has an absentee wife, no money, no paying job, and a 5-year old son (played by his real son, Jaden Smith).

Will Smith was a perfect choice to play the lead character along with his adorable real life son.

 I had read the book previously and did enjoy it more than the movie (as is usually the case) and felt that the part of Gardiner's wife was not well portrayed in the film. She was a lot more cold-hearted and self-centered in real life, based on the book and I thought this should have also been the case in the movie version too. Her portrayal in the movie gave a rather false impression. Other than that, the movie stacked up quite favorably in comparison to the book.

Can't comment on the quality of this dvd, or lack of as this was a movie I borrowed to watch.

Try to avoid working as much as possible? Why do people want to make lots of money? Is it just for their ego? What's wrong with renting a small room somewhere, working a 9 to 5 job, and bringing home just enough for the two of them to spend time together? This movie raising a lot of questions in my mind about ""What is Happiness?"" Is the happiness supposed to be the relationship with his son, or is it this Super Duper Fancy Job for Super Duper Smart People? To me, happiness would be raising your kids in the woods, having a simple life with a few other people. Isn't capitalism in conflict...with happiness? Capitalism is selfishness.

2745007,5,B000MRA59M,"Chris Gardner (Will Smith) lives in a cheap rental apartment with his partner, Linda (Thandie Newton), who is the mother of his son Christopher (Jaden Smith). Gardner works as a salesman and is trying his hardest to support his family, but nobody wants to buy his bone density scanners. Bills are piling up, the rent is two months behind, and his landlord is running out of patience.

Gardner's world changes when he has a chance encounter on the street with a stockbroker. The man owns a flashy car and Gardner notes that everyone walking out of the office building seems happy. He decides to apply to Dean Witter in an attempt to solve all of his problems.

Getting the attention of his potential employer is not easy, but the film, which is set it 1981, uses a Rubik's Cube to demonstrate Gardner's intelligence. Gardner manages to share a cab with a Dean Witter employee who is in a position to recommend him for an interview, and he solves the puzzle of the Rubik's Cube during the journey. That leads to an interview, but Gardner is arrested for non-payment of parking tickets the night before. He turns up for the interview covered in paint and without a shirt. It's a great scene with a lot of humor and Gardner somehow passes the interview.

The film is based on a true story and shows a typical struggle of a man trying to make his way in the world. You might compare it to It's a Wonderful Life in many ways. Linda eventually decides to leave Gardner, but he insists that Christopher will stay with him. It's here that the film stands out. The relationship between father and son is the very heart of the film. Gardner tries to support Christopher, but money is always a problem. The pair are forced to endure some rough times, but Christopher trusts his father and rarely complains.

I think Pursuit of Happyness was a breakthrough role for Smith. We already knew that he could pull off action roles and comedy, but he had to show considerable range to play Chris Gardner. The performance earned him an Oscar nomination and it was truly deserved.

It's interesting watching Gardner claw his way up while he serves his internship. His dual role as a father limits the time he can spend working and studying, but he makes the best use of what time he has available. Jaden Smith was effective as Christopher, though I wonder how much acting was necessary when your on-screen father is your real father.

Director Gabriele Muccino did a good job of focusing on Smith's emotional side and I found myself fully-invested with Gardner's struggle the whole time.

The film makes me wonder how many people are quietly struggling through similar problems every day. In the current economic climate, things are even tougher than they were in 1981. What would you do to ensure that your family is able to survive? Taking two or three jobs is an option, but that places a strain on you and on all of your relationships.

How do you define happiness? Is it enough just to be able to survive? I've explored this theme in a number of reviews and it's highly relevant here. I don't think Gardner was simply pursuing money and career success; he was taking care of his child. Maybe it's important to feel like you are making the most of your abilities? Pride in your performance is one measure of success, and so is spending time with the people you love. I think The Pursuit of Happyness explores a number of important themes. The definition of happiness is subjective. Do you know what your own definition would be?",1331596800,,3510,4.622792937399679

2745011,5,B000MRA59M,"Pursuit of Happiness
 There are so many movies about a man battling against the odds and becoming a hero. Frankly, those movies are the kinds that usually are corny. That is one of many things that make The Pursuit of Happiness so amazing. With a fantastic cast including Will Smith, his son Jaden, and Thadie Newton there isn't too much to complain about when it comes to the acting in the movie. The single best  part of the movie though, is that the spectacular plot, you would have thought was created by a person, actually happened. The movie shows the horrible obstacles the main character, Chris Gardner, had to go through. For instance, the scene when Chris and his son Christopher have nowhere to go for the night so they are forced to lock themselves in the subway bathroom. But, the optimistic personality of Chris allows him to convert such a horrific situation into a fun and creative place, as he pretends with his son that they are actually in the time of the dinosaurs. The way Will Smith does this scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie to follow.
 There are many other great things about this movie besides the plot and acting. This movie will satisfy young children, adults, and elderly people so much that there is no age range that would respectfully capture the unique leeway this movie allows when it comes to various ages. Also, this movie is perfect for the person who loves a heroic, inspiring movie or even the person who enjoys a sad, depressing movie as well. There is just too much good to say about this movie.
 This movie is so inspiring. It portrays for the viewer that there is always hope. In the movie, Chris Gardner had less than fifty dollars on more the one occasion and still works hard, uses his mind, and conserves as much money as he can. An example of his quick thinking is shown in a very powerful scene taking place in a taxi with the boss of the company Chris is trying to work for. He has about ten minutes to impress the boss by finishing a Rubik's cube he has been working on since the beginning of the movie when Christopher Jr. gets it as a present. He finishes it in the nick of time with about 10 seconds to spare. This scene showed the devotion Chris had to everything he set out to do. The story depicted in this movie was spot on and I hope that this movie generates much success as I enjoyed it so much.",1326240000,,2368,4.399543378995434

2745014,5,B000MRA59M,"""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a movie about a man who after failing to sell some medical products ends up splitting with his wife. After struggling to pay the rent he ends up homeless with his son. Despite the circumstances he decides to take an internship at a Wall street investment firm (even though they will only select one of the 30+ interns to work there).

Throughout the movie he struggles to make ends meet, one time losing all his money (seized by the IRS), other times paying parking tickets with the last bit of money he has.

But Chris Gardner never gave up, until he ended up getting selected to work at the firm.

I think the Jaden/Will Smith combination is one of the best things about the movie. This movie is one of, if not the, best movies I have seen in my life.

2745016,5,B000MRA59M,"Will Smith's portrayal of Chris Gardener in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is Chapter three of the unabashed book version of the trauma, pain and suffering of a young man's impoverished journey from his early childhood through his struggles in his commitment to be a single father. This is a true story of Chris Gardner, who in the 1980s experienced being homeless, while caring for his young son. Gardner seized the moment and created an opportunity, while Homeless, to make it as stockbroker after being selected into an internship program. The film depicted the last chapter in the book and stays true to Gardner's struggle and story. Chris Gardener was on set during the production and appears in the last scene. Chris Gardner is the successful man that passes Smith walking with his son. Smith glances back at the real Chris Gardener, the successful man that he would grow to be. If you haven't read the book, it is a must read. It would certainly make an excellent gift for any young man struggling with difficulties, self-esteem or doubts about creating the Best that one can Be - starting with nothing. Chris Gardner experienced the American Dream and helped many along the road to his success. Today, a self-made millionaire, he realized his dream to meet the former South African President, Nelson Mandela who welcomed Gardener into his home. Gardener says in the end of his book: ""I am Blessed Among Men."" Be warned.

You feel his frustrations as he faces each new setback with strength and determination and you feel yourself rooting for him the whole film. The relationship between Chris snr and his wife are hard to watch as you see their marriage breakdown and unless you've been in that kind of situation I guess you'll never know how hard it can be.

It is a movie that focuses on determination and perseverance, and love.

I understand this is a fictionalized account of the real Chris Gardner, currently a multimillionaire philanthropist and motivational speaker.  His path to fame and fortune was rough, and that is what was portrayed by Smith in this movie.  As Gardner (Smith) faces challenge after challenge, his son, Christopher (played by Will Smith's own son), is right there with him, going from apartment to hotel to homeless shelter.  The personal agonies hit you in the gut, so that the viewer is left with an unsatisfying... guilt?  Fear?  Many viewers cannot understand the impact of seeing a five dollar bill leave your pocket, knowing that the bill represents food for the day, now gone.

And when Gardner receives the competitive six month internship (yay), hears that only one of the twenty interns will be hired (brrrr), and finds out that interns are not paid a penny during that period (ouch), you will feel his angst.

Watching Gardner's frustrations and trials was almost voyeuristic.

Gardner knows he cannot support his son for long by continuing in his profession, so he displays that plucky American entrepreneurial spirit and enters a cutthroat competition to become a high paid executive at a financial institution. The competition is basically a full-time, six-month internship with no pay, during which time Gardner must outperform the other competitors.

2745105,3,B000MRA59M,"I hate to go against the wind here, but this movie was too tense, too extreme. This movie reminded me of the tribulations of Job in the Bible. The movie's portrayal Chris Gardner's pain and hardships never ended until the final 5 minutes of the movie.

Was this ""really how it was"", this extreme. So many questions: Questions like how did he afford to pay for the childcare expenses when he had no income, yet had to stay at a shelter? Did he really have to leave work early to pick up his child at daycare in an attempt to get to the shelter before it closed at five o'clock?

More obvious questions like: Why would he allow his child to go thru such foreseeable hardships when he is offered a reprieve from the boys mother. Let her take him for awhile, at least until he's established enough with an income and a place to live. No, instead, he just says, ""you know you can't take care of him"", so she leaves, no contact with the child for presumably at least 6 months.

One obstacle after another, ninety minutes of being abused, humiliated, degraded, all while caring for a five-year child.  This was like water torture having to watch the pain one man is enduring. However, I couldn't help but think was his misfortunes time and time again overdone, way overdone. Did he really have his 5-year-old child with him while he had no income for six months and lived in various shelters?  Was his income really completely dependent upon selling medical equipment that nobody wanted, and that two were taken from him, which he did recover after great misfortune. Were the horrendous misfortunes, one after another really true? If they were, how did he not go insane?  Well, it turns out no. Most of it was made up-""Hollywoodized'.  In real life, things were not as bad as portrayed in the movie, thank goodness. The greatest problem encountered by Will Smiths character in the movie was that he was not given a salary while training at Dean Witter. So his only source of income was selling his last few pieces of medical equipment. This was not enough to sustain him and his son in any stable housing, which lead him to seek out various shelters. Well, after doing a little research about the real Chris Gardner, it appears most of what was portrayed in the movie is not true; it's a greatly fictionalized account. He was given a stipend at Dean Witter of $1000 a month while training, and most important he didn't' have his child with him while he was training with them, so all the rushing to shelters before five o'clock with his son didn't happen. So many examples of the truth being stretched to make a more compelling drama, but for me, it was way overboard.  Mr. Gardner's true-life story is a very compelling one. I have not read his book, only synopsis of it.  However one thing about his true life is apparent, he was not a Saint, yet the movie goes out of its way to almost portray him as one. He is not a bad man either. He is just a man, a man who had many hardships and disadvantages in his life, all of which he did overcome and become a great success. As stated however, the movie seems to want to go out of it's way to show a Saintly genius, one with the ability to overcoming one tragedy after another, endure more one pain, one more humiliation, one more unbelievable mishap after another, all the way to the last five minutes of the movie. Then, only in the last one-minute of the movie, right before the ending credits do we read a few lines that now he is a millionaire. Everything's ok. I would have been more pleased with the real life story of Mr. Gardner's life, not the emotional rollercoaster we were deliberately put through for ninety minutes. I'm sure it's a great success story, and I'll be happy to watch the real story if it ever comes out.

As a side note, Will Smith's portrayal was excellent; his real life son did a great job in his film debut. Every actor was good; all the sets were excellent, just that little thing about the story went too far.",1269561600,,3983,4.451303155006859

2745117,5,B000MRA59M,"First, let me just quickly say that the acting, plot construction, scenery, and other standard elements are very good in this movie.  There are no significant flaws which threaten to ruin the movie.

Turning to the story itself, as most people know, this movie is ""inspired by a true story"" involving a man who faces enormous financial hardships, to the point where he and his son wind up homeless.  The problems he encounters are so relentless that it becomes almost too painful to watch.  But he's gifted at math, has good interpersonal skills, and works incredibly hard, so he eventually winds up with a nice job in a San Francisco financial firm, and later goes on to start his own firm and become a multi-millionaire.

A story like this will naturally appeal to an American audience because it taps in to the meritocratic notion that the American dream is accessible to most of us if we're willing to work hard and make sacrifices.  But we can question how much this moving and inspiring story can really serve as a model for the masses.  I would say not much.  In a country of 300 million people, you'll always be able to find stories like this, but they're the exception, not the norm, and of course that's what makes this story worthy of a movie.  Moreover, the main character clearly had abilities and a work ethic far beyond the norm, so it took very special strengths to prevail over such especially bad luck.  But I do think this story illustrates the upper limits of what's possible, and most people can draw the lesson that working hard will still provide at least some benefit, even if the benefit falls short of one's ultimate dreams.

Another lesson which is perhaps equally important is that children may value and need our love and attention more than the material resources we can provide.  That's certainly the case in this story, and I suspect that this can be generalized to most children.  Something to consider for dads (and moms) who are preoccupied with putting in long hours away from home in order to make a lot of money ...

Highly recommended to anyone looking for an uplifting story, even if few people can replicate an ending as happy as this one.",1265500800,2,2180,4.643229166666667

2745121,4,B000MRA59M,"When it comes to motivational and inspirational pursue-your-dreams kind of movies THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS may very well take home the prize.  I was amazed first by Will Smith's persuasive portrayal of Chris Gardner and second by the character's unending drive in the face of a barrage of setbacks, disappointments, along with the most unpredictable attacks from Murphy.  Long after most people would have thrown in the towel, he keeps on, stays focused, and doesn't rest until his dream of becoming a successful stockbroker and a providing father are complete.

It's a message badly needed in our world today.  It's also a strong portrayal of a father which is rarely seen in Hollywood today (as Hollywood, for whatever reason, is almost never father-friendly).  I think my favorite line in the film (also in the trailer) is when after Chris's son says he wants to become a famous basketball player someday, and Chris almost unconsciously gives his son the typical reflex-reply that most parents would give: Don't practice too much, there's too many people better than you, etc.  (I'm paraphrasing.)  Then he catches himself and remembers his own seemingly hopeless situation and adds, ""Don't let anybody ever tell you that you can't do something--not even me!""

My major problem with this film (many would probably call it a small thing) is the plain-sight portrayal of the F-word on the side of the son's daycare building.  I know they're trying to say it's in a rough neighborhood, but they could have conveyed that without putting an expletive on the side of the building.  Later we hear the boy repeat the word, asking if it's spelled correctly.  Lately, it seems Hollywood enjoys having small children use profanity in films.  This principle is incompatible with family entertainment.

Come to think of it, there's no reason, why they couldn't have clean the film up and given it a PG-rating.",1259971200,,1899,5.009554140127388

In this movie, Will Smith acts a father who put all of his energy toward his goals. He was a happy middle-class family man who invested all of his savings on a promising small business which later failed. He lost everything. His wife, however, only added to the problem. She was shallow and unsupportive. Their situation was difficult because he was a brilliant man who had a real shot at making it if only he could finish an unpaid internship at a stock firm, but in the meantime, he wouldn't be able to make a dime. His wife was a hard worker, but she didn't have much ambition. All she wanted was for him to get a weak job and keep it for the rest of his life. He wanted more though. And he took the internship.

His wife eventually left him and he kept their kid. She wanted no responsibilities.

It's truly heartbreaking how he plays with his kid and makes him believe that they are ""camping"" when they have to sleep in the streets. He is really a great father and his pain is transferred from the screen to your heart. This movie made me cry of sadness and joy after he finally made it.

He ended up founding his own stock firm.

2745125,5,B000MRA59M,"In this tear jerking drama Will Smith trades in his super hero cape and takes up the role of an average Joe. No saving the world this time, instead his fight is to give his son a better life. After what seems like a lifetime of misfortune and bad luck Chris Gardner (Smith) is left alone to raise his son (Jaden Smith). The only problem is he barely has enough money to keep a house over their heads. The only glimmer of hope they have left is an internship at Dean Witter a stockbroker company. This may turn out to be the job of a lifetime, but with every glimmer there is always an obstacle course that guards its way. Of course this case is no different, not only is Chris up against nineteen other well educated candidates who have plenty more experience, but the internship doesn't pay a cent. Chris finds himself questioning whether or not this risk is worth taking and we find ourselves hoping with heavy hearts and watery eyes that it is.

The Pursuit of Happiness is jam packed with hard-hitting emotion. Good luck getting through this one without shedding a tear. With a story that hits so close to home for so many of us, it can be almost painful to watch. Many of us on some level know the struggle that Smith's character faces, we know all about that horrible feeling of helplessness we feel when assuring your child that ""everything will be ok"" when you  yourself are not so sure. The train station scene is a perfect example of how this movie taps into our emotions, and leaves us feeling completely vulnerable.

  Smith incredible in this film, proving to us once again that he deserves his place as one of our most loved actors, but it his son Jaden Smith (who plays Christopher) who shows us that acting definitely runs in the family. He is quickly following in his father's footsteps. Even at a young age he has flawlessly portrayed his role (and he is just so adorable!).

2745161,5,B000MRA59M,"This is indeed a great inspirational film. It's the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who has struggled with both his finances and his support for his son. His only chance of success is becoming a stockbroker, and he tries his hardest during his internship while taking care of the only person he cares about. And he does this when he is evicted from his own home, and starts living in a motel, a subway train, even in a public bathroom. But Chris never gives up on not only his dreams of success, but his dream of his own son fulfilling his own dreams of success.

Surely, this is a very inspirational film about perseverance, success, and family. And now this film is way more significant today. We're in the middle of a chaotic economic crisis, and it looks to be getting worse. Thousands of people are losing jobs and businesses, hundreds of homes are in foreclosure, food and gas prices have gone up, and big corporations are going bankrupt and being shut down. Of all the misery that the entire world is facing, there is still hope. We just can't give up on our own dreams. we can make it. We have to work hard at what we do and what we want to be, even if we can't pay our bills on time. Right now I'm twenty-two years old, and I'm still not giving up on my dreams of being a n author, despite many obstacles that I'm facing right now. My parents, older brother, and I have moved into an apartment just last year, and we're still facing major challenges. My parents and my brother aren't making that much money and are having trouble with payments, while I'm struggling with my grades (and money) during my fourth year in a community college and it looks like I've still got a few more years until I can actually transfer to a university. But I shouldn't feel horrible about all this. I still believe that we can pull this all off. We have to feel confident that we can achieve a great deal in the future. Right now, I'm in the process of writing several short stories, and I'm hoping to publish at least some of it this year. And maybe in a couple of years, I could publish my very first novel. With the obstacles I'm facing, I'm sure I can beat them.

This is why ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" and Chris Gardner himself, is so special. It's a constant reminder that are dreams can be fulfilled. We have to work hard and believe in ourselves. If we quit, then we are disappointing ourselves and the people are supporting us. In the end, it's all about perseverance.

Crisp, sharp image and excellent sound on the DVD, though.",1246838400,,1007,5.191358024691358
2745164,5,B000MRA59M,"I loved this movie although it was quite a roller coaster to watch, keeping you on the edge of you seat from start to finish, taking you from the lowest of the lows (when the father realizes they were homeless) to the highest of highs in the pursuit of happy-ness. It's not a date movie, rather one to watch at home with tissues close by.

Don't miss the bonus features - an interesting mini-documentary about the real Chris Gardner, who was actually on the set almost full time as an advisor; an in-depth view at how the movie was made by a foreign director who spoke very little English; the father-son relationship, on an off the set, and how Jayden was cast (yes, he was the best kid for the role out of hundreds who auditioned); and the Rubik cube, how it was invented and top ""speedcubers"" solving the puzzle in less than 30 seconds (the record was 30 minutes in 1981 when the movie was set), and an unbelievable bit where a guy solves it blindfolded in two minutes flat.

Will Smith's son is fantastic in this movie, but it's definitely not for children - some scenes might be too dramatic and may be difficult to explain to younger ones.

In short, simply a great story of a father's love for his child, perseverance and triumph against the odds.",1246406400,,1254,4.443478260869565

2745166,5,B000MRA59M,"This true story opens in San Francisco in the eighties, where salesman Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is barely able to make ends meet.  His wife (Thandie Newton) gets fed up and leaves, and Chris must juggle a non-paying internship with a brokerage firm with caring for his five-year old son, Christopher (Jaden Smith). With no income, Chris and Christopher go from cheap apartment to cheaper motel and eventually become homeless.

I waited a long time to see this movie because I thought it would be sugary-sweet and corny, but it's not; it's realistic and scary, heartwarming, and inspiring.  Smith portrays Chris as an intelligent, hardworking, and extremely likeable man who sees his world crumble around him.  He gives a truly memorable performance.  His real-life son Jaden is also wonderful as the plucky little boy who rolls with the punches and loves his dad no matter what.

This film about a father's descent into homelessness is full of frustration, tempered with the innocence and resilience of the little son.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  Recommended.",1244937600,,1066,5.051428571428572

Before this movie, there was Wall Street in 1987 having Michael Douglas as the evil Gordon Gekko, power hungry stock broker who uses insider trading to make himself richer but yet Douglas won the Oscar@ for playing this guy and Will Smith lost his Oscar to Forest Whitaker as the evil Idi Amin in ""The Last King of Scotland.""

2745189,4,B000MRA59M,"We are not used to seeing Will Smith playing the father taking care of his son alone. Especially in his world under Reagan. He lost his wife, then his apartment, then a second apartment, then he had to go to homeless people's shelters, with his son mind you, sleep in BART toilets, with his son mind you, work like hell to get a new profession in the world of finance, go on selling some of the medical machines he was selling before to just make ends meet, to avoid the worst possible, losing his child, his son. And he manages to keep his cool, to remain friendly with everyone, even those who obviously exploit him, and he proves himself and he gets the job, one out of twenty. The whole film is dominated by a quotation from the Declaration of Independence, the ""pursuit of happyness"". And this pursuit is a real chase but a chase that does not so much take place outside, because outside it is a hunt not for happiness but for the game that is homeless, defenseless, out of luck and deprived of the minimum. But the chase, and the pursuit, is in one's mind first and foremost. If you are not free in your mind, if you have no project and if you do not have the motivation and the determination to get it going, you will not overcome the difficulties life will bring. Though I think this is true for everyone, that motivation and determination are the basic qualities you need to get anywhere in life, the end result will be quite different and vary a lot according to the point where you started and the opportunities that will come along across your own path and that you will be able to catch. We definitely are equal potentially, but the end results of people in their lives vary tremendously and then at this point equality is no longer the main characteristic. That makes the film slightly sad. For one financial success, how many meager survivals?

2745191,3,B000MRA59M,"My normal policy is to not write reviews for products that already have 10 or more reviews, and I know that this review will disappear into oblivion in a month or so, probably after netting several ""unhelpful"" votes. So why bother? Because this film, despite its almost universally positive reception, got my hackles up.

The Will Smith character, Chris Gardner, is portrayed as being a loving and caring father who is doing everything he's doing for the sake of his 5-year-old son. Nonsense. Chris Gardner is doing what he is doing primarily for himself. Yes, he does take good care of his son, but the final result is positive only because things do work out for him in the end.

What if it had all gone horribly wrong? For every person who attempts to do what Chris Gardner did, and succeeds, there are 100 who attempt it and fail. What then? What would the consequences have been for Chris Gardner's son?

My claim is that a really responsible father would have bitten the bullet and taken an ordinary job and settled down to being a single father and living a simple life, instead of gambling everything on ""the American dream"". Doing what Chris Gardner did, while it did succeed for him, was, in fact, irresponsible.

Another irritating aspect of this movie is that to a large extent it pushes the idea that money and happiness go hand-in-hand. Those who are rich are all portrayed as being happy and decent people, which in my experience is far from the truth.

And then there's the problem of whether Chris Gardner's chosen profession is admirable or meaningful in the general context of human activities. My understanding of financial markets is almost zero, but I got the impression that Mr. Gardner was becoming successful by selling the kind of financial constructions that have since become part of the Wall Street meltdown and the trigger to a global financial crisis.

My conclusion is that ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a Hollywood ""feel-good"" movie that doesn't stand up to a more critical examination.

2745192,5,B000MRA59M,"Based on the true story of entrepreneur/millionaire Chris Gardner,  the movie follows the struggles of a homeless single father trying to raise his son in 1980's San Francisco, while pursuing the grand dream of becoming a stockbroker.  The story evokes tears of sadness and tears of joy, as it takes the viewer through a real daily struggle not uncommon to so many in the world around us.  A rags-to-riches story, yes, but even more a story of determination and hard work and a story of human potential.

Will Smith performs his best role ever as Chris Gardner, and his real life son Jaden plays the  younger Christopher.  Their chemistry is inspiring, as is the rest of the film.

This 2006 movie is rated PG-13 with good reason, however, and I don't recommend it as a ""family film,"" as it has some brief language, and the subject matter is too intense for children.  For teens, however, and adults, it is a must-see movie!",1235520000,,924,4.660493827160494

He gets a chance to become a stock broker, and you find yourself drawn into his life and the challenges he faces.  There are many great scenes that Smith turns in, but one of the most gripping is when he tries to find a make-shift bedroom in a subway.  Heartbreaking.

Overall a great movie which shows how Will Smith can turn in solid performances in non-action/non-comedy roles and is all the more compelling since the movie is based on a true story.

2745195,5,B000MRA59M,"Will Smith stars with his son Jaden in this true story about going for it all when life seems like it is giving you no opportunity at all.

Chris Gardner was always working to make it selling medical equipment which he acquired out of his own pocket to sell to small Doctors offices.  His family life is in shambles and he is really going nowhere with a son who is caught between Gardner and his ex.  Gardner thinks about an opportunity he hears of working for an investment firm as an intern and he goes for it.

He faces many challenges while attempting to even get into the program, where only one person of all who go through it are selected.  The premise of the movie, is that we in the USA have the right to pursue happiness.  It is not a given.  Carter worked to pursue what would make him happy and this movie is even a way to give back.

You will see some of the actual areas where Carter actually operated, even the homeless shelter is the actual one where he stayed eeking out a living.  (The DVDs features will tell you a whole lot more about that that is even touching just by itself.)

This is a movie about winning in life, and mostly, not giving up when things seem the worst.  I could name a cliche or two, but really, this man applied what it took for him to be a success, and Smith really delivers.

I cannot understand the one and two star votes here.  This is a movie of meaning and Smith does an outstanding performance.  Get Pursuit of Happyness, you just might learn something.",1234310400,,1501,4.276595744680851

Smith's character wasn't always gentle or understanding with his son (although he was obviously under an immense strain), but the scene that sold the movie for me was when he and his son ended up spending the night in the BART public bathroom.  With Smith and his real life son, huddled on the bathroom floor, toilet paper scattered around in an attempt at creating a meager sleeping pallet and the tears of fear and desperation, that really touched me.

I listened to the Pursuit of Happyness audiobook, but became too frustrated with the beginning to finish it (Gardner's mother raised her kids in a horrible, abusive relationship and just kept getting pregnant and becoming more dependent on the psycho, alcoholic, abusive man that threatened her family on a daily basis), but thankfully the movie didn't dwell on that portion of the book.

Not only was this movie positive, but it was also amazingly free from excessive profanity and blatant sex, which I found refreshing.

The acting was perfect.  It never felt as though the people were playing roles.  It seemed we were looking into their lives.  Jaden Smith was incredibly good in his part.

If the story had been fiction, I would have complained that it was too farfetched to happen; but since it really did happen, I simply have to admire the man who struggled with superhuman strength to be all the man he could be day after day.

The line with his boy on the basketball court, where he tells him never to let anyone take his dream away by telling him he cannot do something, is very poignant as it shows us how easy it is to fold under negative pressure from people who say I CAN'T or YOU CAN'T.  The message here is to take what you do have, even when it seems it isn't much, and try with all you have within you to turn it around, survive, come out on top and say I CAN.

You see, in order to understand the struggle, you have to have LIVED it. I understand this movie because I HAVE lived it. Some other review cited that it took far too long to display the epic struggle that left us no time to relish the moment of success. I submit that were it not for the INTENSE struggle he faced, there would BE no reason to celebrate his ultimate success. It would have less meaning. I have NEVER cried so hard as I did at the end of this movie. During the course of the film, you FEEL his pain of wanting to be just that little bit more than what he felt himself to be. You yearn for him to experience that one bit of happiness to know that he doesn't HAVE to sell his blood anymore to make a few bucks to be able to fix a light in a bone density scanner he sells to provide a meal and a place to live for a few weeks for himself and his son. This man went through more tribulations than any of the other reviewers here have seen in their own lives or the family and friends that surround them. If you want to see a film that TRULY lifts you up by the climax, see the pursuit of happyness, and IGNORE the many discouraging reviews from people who have no clear understanding of personal anguish and eventual triumph.

It's basically a tribute to the pursuing one's dreams despite the obstacles that are thrown in front of you and perservering in the end.  Will Smith's Chris Gardner is an industrious chap with a lot of charm and savvy but suffers from a little misdirection.  He begins the film peddling around San Francisco doctor's offices bone density scanners.  This venture doesn't make him rich so he soon sets his goal on an internship with Dean Witter for a one-in-twenty shot at being a stockbroker.  There are many pitfalls to attaining his dream.  His wife recently left him with a five year old son to fend for.  The internship is unpaid.  He's evicted from a number of domiciles and at times forced to live in shelters and public bathrooms.  Racism isn't really cited as a reason for Chris' predicament but there are subtle hints like when Dean Witter's instructor forces Chris to park his car.  Despite it all Chris never wavers from his determination.  Credit Will Smith for giving a full-bodied portrait of a man who wants his piece of the American Pie.  Not to give anything away, the look on the face of Chris as he meets with the Dean Witter executives toward the films end will bring out the tear ducts.  Jaden Smith, Will's real life son and his son in the film, gives a naturally charming and unaffected performance.

2745316,5,B000MRA59M,"Based on a true story, The Pursuit of Happyness (which stars Will Smith and his actual son Jaden) is about Chris Gardner. Chris is a smart, capable guy, but he's gotten himself into a bad situation. He sunk his life savings into selling bone density scanners, which don't seem to be moving very quickly. And his girlfriend Linda (played by Thandie Newton, looking as bad as a person that gorgeous can look), who's been working double shifts to make ends meet, gets fed up. She's going to leave him and take the kid, but Chris won't let her. So she leaves him AND the kid. Here's where things get interesting. In an effort to better their situation, Chris applies for a competitive broker internship. He's learned that out of a pool of 20 interns, only one will be offered a job at the end of the six-month program. He gets the internship. Problem? It's unpaid.

So, Chris has to start selling some scanners, FAST. He has moderate success, but there are still times when the father/son team is living pretty close to the bone. During some scenes, such as when the little family finds itself homeless for a while, I almost cried. These are the kinds of characters I can root for. Chris is doing everything possible to keep body and soul together and make a future for himself and his son. And sometimes, it still isn't enough. But the guy just won't give up. He powers through the worst of circumstances. He puts a brave face on for his kid. He keeps his wits about him. He doesn't cave. You gotta love a guy like that.

Will Smith is great in this. He must have gotten in awesome shape, too, because he spends alot of the movie in a flat-out run. (Talk about hustle.) And Jaden is adorable. His sweet, soft little-boy face. His good nature. His ultimate trust in his dad (on screen and off). A totally effortless performance, it was perfect for this movie. You will love this kid.

I think others have described this film more than adequately, so I'll just try to add a few points here beyond the obvious inspirational quality of the movie.

First, the bonus features really are bonuses.  The ""making of"" documentary is a ""must see"" after you've watched the movie.  The mini documentary on the Rubics Cube is great too!

Second, something some may not notice that I did was the painstaking attention to detail in reproducing the early 1980's.  (This was mentioned in the ""making of"" documentary)  When we see scenes taken outside where there is a lot of traffic, I saw many cars but not one that was after 1981.  All the appliances, electronic devices, and other set decorations took me right back to about 1980.  Quite amazing.  Way more work went into this movie that you'd expect.

This movie shows what the opposite of cynicism looks like.  And, it gave me something to really think about.  Maybe it's the persuit of ""happyness"" that makes life worthwhile, as much or more than being ""happy"".

Finally, I very much appreciated the fact that the story was ethnically neutral, for lack of a better term.  What I mean is that the situation Chris Gardner found himself in could have happened to anyone regardless of background.  He was essentially a gifted person who made a bad business decision and soon found himself in a desparate situation.  He found some happy people (stock brokers) and decided to persue that happiness, and against the odds he succeeded.",1193356800,,1728,4.703333333333333

Will Smith is liked by just about everyone, but I think he isn't credited enough as an actor. The Pursuit of Happyness really shows off Will Smith's talent with his son as his co-star.

All women should watch this movie and think of their husbands because this is (a dramatized version of) what most men go through in life in the struggle to make a living and be successful (although in real life the ending is not always this happy).

All young adults starting out in the working world should watch this movie as this is a fine example of work ethics, dedication to the job, and good manners.

All parents should watch this movie as this is a fine example of how to (try) to balance work life with bringing up a child and spending time with the family.

The way Will Smith played those roles so perfectly that you could feel his hurt, pain, and stress within the scenes in your heart. You know its amazing to see a black man show a great example of a great man coming up from nothing and making his life worth something, so that his child would do the same. I really enjoyed this movie it touched me in so many different ways, for a moment I sat down and thought about weather or not I was going to be like the mother in that film to just give up on my husband, when we are going through hard times and just walkout and leave.

Up until his performance in ""I, Robot,"" I couldn't see him for anything more than a goofy rapper-turned-actor who played characters based solely on the degree of their sarcasm and humor.  In ""I, Robot,"" I began to see beyond the old Smith and came to see him as an adult who could pull off excellent roles.  With ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" Smith shows that he's matured even more.  Not once did I picture him as Carlton's cousin or the cocky flyboy from ""Independence Day.""  He has come full circle as an actor and deserves to be recognized for it.

""Happyness"" is based on the real-life story of Chris Gardner, a man who lost everything trying to do what's best for his family and eventually becoming a top stockbroker and businessman.  The viewer basically lives out the struggles of a man with not much more than street smarts and a high school diploma to get him, his girlfriend, and son through life.  Fed up with the life Gardner provides, his wife (Thandie Newton) leaves him and (reluctantly) their son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) for the greener pastures of New York.  Determined to make it in San Francisco, Gardner takes a non-paying internship with Dean Witter and has to rely on his dwindling and hard-to-sell stock of bone density scanners to put food on the table.  Needless to say, Gardner and his son face immense hardships, eventually being forced to live on the street, staying in a public bathroom and shelters in order to survive.

The story's outcome is wonderful and heartwarming.  I'm not ashamed to say that this film made me cry.  It is a perfect realization of every father's greatest fear:  not being able to provide for his family.

Here he gives an incredible performance as the quintessential good man who struggles to survive against random events which nearly overwhelm him (and would probably overwhelm anyone else). I just got done making a point about the movie Apocalypto which I will also make here. Movies like these fully reveal how silly we are to spend so much time obsessed with race, sex, and class in our society because no matter what your persuasion or ethnicity is most of us can easily relate intimately to those who differ from us when the circumstances necessitate it. In this film we cheer for Smith to succeed with all of our might. Our desire to see him make it is all-consuming.

All of us, no matter what we look like, can relate to the character of Chris Gardner. The first hour of the film is almost painful to watch as we see a bright, capable, assertive man get beaten down by the vagaries of life. They called him ""Ten Gallon Head"" in high school because of how smart he was but most of the film is a testament to man's impotence and limitations when confronted with forces he cannot control. His intelligence does not even seem to matter. Gardner seems to ""run bad"" for 95 percent of the movie.

Yet, his character and belief in himself are pervasively on display. He is a role model to everyone. Despite the disasters that keep punching him in the gut he refuses to quit. He refuses to accept defeat. He fights until...well, see the film. I bet you'll love the ending as much as I did. Yes, it is a tear-jerker but I was quite taken with The Pursuit of Happyness.",1188691200,,1647,4.450331125827814
2745414,5,B000MRA59M,"The execution of the main role by Mr. Will Smith is beyond words, and it is hereby hoped that those who watch it
will appreciate the content of the movie as it is a true (albeit small part) reflection of the plight of the
""Brother"" who has managed to survive ""caving in"" to the imposed eurocentric (mentally and physically draining)
pressures of survival that he finds constantly burdened on him as none of us were really given a choice to be born
into this world.

It must have taken a lot out of Mr. Will Smith to be able to embed himself into the shoes of the main character and
be able to produce realistic ""acting"" as good as he was able to just as Mr. Denzil Washington was able to do in the
recap of brother Malcolm X (RIPP).

Like I said, for those brothers who have escaped being dragged under by the system this is part of our collective
story of survival in a world and system we neither asked to be born into nor participated in its creation or
maintenance.

Needless to state, initially I thought the recap by Mr. Smith of Brother Mohammed Ali was good, but he has once again shown he can step into the shoes of the wider (voiceless) community at large which is much appreciated....all I can say Mr. Smith is ThanXs!

2745416,5,B000MRA59M,"Well this movie is definitely something that classics are made of.

Movie begins with Will Smith day to day life of not so successful salesman, his ruined married life and the love for his son.

At one point he decides that he has to give up his sales career to go into stock market. When he discusses with his wife she is anything but supportive. He approaches the person for the job who seems to be too busy all the time. However once while making a sales call he happens to travel with this guy and he resolves the rubik's cube in matter of minutes.

He is then interviewed and taken in for an internship without any payment for 6 months. The worst time of his life. He then attends the classroom for six months & manages his sales calls looks after his son since wife has decided on separation. And he utimately emerges as a winner.

When you see this character struggle you actually feel that this is your own story in one way.

Some wonderful scenes

Will Smith finishes his classes at the stock market firm, picks up his son and finishes his sales call and he has to rush back to the place to spend the night as he is homeless and this place is available on first come first serve basis. He doesn't get this place and he has to spend the night on one of the railway platforms. He goes to the rest room where his son sleeps and he is awake and starts crying whenever someone knocks on the door.

Will Smith is really running on a tightrope with finances. When one of his colleagues from the stock market forgets his own wallet he asks Will Smith to pay for the cab. The way Smith gives that 5 - 10 bucks makes you understand value for money

In interview which he attends directly after getting released from prison. He is dressed badly yet attends the interview. He is asked a question, 'What would you say if I hire a person who attends the interview without any shoes?'
Will Smith replies 'Well he must be wearing really good pants'

And the expression when he recieves the job, vow....!!!

About the performances

Will Smith gives probably the best performance of life time. He crawls easily under the skin of the character. He just lives the character. You are reminded of Meryl Streeps performance in Music of the Heart. Nowhere in the entire movie is it evident that Will and Christopher are father and son off screen too. I have seen few movies of Will Smith like MIB, Wild Wild West, Enemy of the state, Independence Day. He has more than matured as an actor. Hats off to him.

Christopher Smith on the other hand gives a flawless performance. The way he cries when he loses his toy makes you feel sorry for the child. He has taken what can be called as legacy from his father. And my personal belief is that he is a gifted actor. I do wish we see a lot more of him.

The movie
Good story, good performance, neat presentation and overall a very good movie. The movie could have been sad in so many places and lost its major vein. But it does not. And it does not loose track. Just like Shawshank Redemption. I don't know the box office business of the movie, I am sure it has done good.

It is suppose to be based on a true story which in todays world might have meant that a white guy applied for a job and was a track star and they got this movie out of that story. I think that Will Smith was going for Tom Cruises record of being the greatest runner in the history of cinema. Smith, who I don't think is a great actor but who does an adequate job runs, runs and runs some more thru this entire movie.

He loses his wife, who is simply being sensible and giving up on a husband who obviously cannot do anything right. Living from hand to mouth as he does, from whence did he figure out that the only job he could contemplate (aside from selling worthless pseudo-x-ray machines to uninterested doctors) was at Dean Witter? What on earth gave him the idea, as he stood before the Dean Witter building and watched the minions of Witter exiting to the street, that stock brokers are a happy-go-lucky bunch of people? What he puts his young son through probably traumatized him for life - his mother abandons him, he loses all his belongings, he has to sleep in public restrooms and in homeless shelters. And all just so dear old dad can have his dream of being a pinchey stock broker.

It gives the viewer more reason to get lost in the movie.  And, this movie was totally based on reality.  Will Smith does an excellent job of acting.  My opinion is that this movie, The Pursuit of Happyness, is his best acting in film.  It was so well done, and well acted by everyone, including the little child, and also Thandie Newton is an excellent actress portraying a bitter, disappointed, working-class struggling wife.

2745434,2,B000MRA59M,"I'm told that soprano sax hack Kenny G once played a sustained, uninterrupted note for an entire hour.  (There is no data available regarding how many audience members took their own lives in response.)  In The Pursuit of Happyness, Will Smith tops this dubious distinction by playing the same note for 2 hours straight, no variation in pitch, tempo, color, texture - unadulterated schmaltz.  Smith is box office gold because he's just so darn wholesome and non-threatening, which is precisely why he had no prayer of pulling this off.  Had it been played for real, this would have been a dark and chilling movie, ultimately an inspiring one, but it's far too well-scrubbed for that.

Smith plays Chris Gardner, and Gardner's overriding passion is to be a good father.  He and real life son Jaden Smith traipse through the film like a couple of hobos; one expects to see them holding cigar butts with toothpicks and playing harmonicas.  Mom, played by the exotically beautiful Thandie Newton, abandons Chris, son, and the pleasures of San Francisco to work as a waitress in New York.  (Presumably there were no more waitress positions available in San Fran.)  Why she breaks that strongest of all bonds - mother and child - is never explained, she's a straw character exiting early.  This leaves us with only dad and son, and dad's big dream - which is to be a stockbroker.  The mystery of why anyone in his right mind would want to be a stockbroker is explained early on when Chris sees one parking a Ferrari - say no more!  Obviously a car like that is happiness - I mean happyness.

Of course, you and I know better.  We know that the end of Chris's rainbow is not a pot of money; much less the maniacal streetwalking stockbrokers engage in to make that kind of money.  It is, of course, the relationship he has with his son - which he has had all along.  Unfortunately the director doesn't seem to know this, because all action drives from impoverishment to ultimate acceptance in the temple of lucre.  What makes this worse is that there seems to be no chemistry at all between Smith and his actual son.  Any chance the film had of touching a nerve depended entirely on a convincing performance by young Smith.  He is every bit as likeable as dear old dad, a real chip off the old blockhead, but there's no spark there at all.

As the film reminds us, Jefferson spoke of the pursuit of happiness, i.e. one must seek it.  My advice, look a little harder.",1186272000,11,2458,4.591743119266055

It was slow-moving, and after about an hour, it was established that this guy was having a tough time. One thing we noticed was the sensitivity and unconditional love for his son, and his very common sense approach to life at large without crippling the son's mind for life. The screenwriters are to be commended for adapting Chris  Gardner's auto-biography in a direct, matter-of-fact way. I thought the pairing of Mr. Smith and his son, Jaden, was fine (unlike others' opinions). I also thought that Thandie Newton played the wife with the utmost despair, a frustration that she simply couldn't deal with. I would like to know what ultimately happened to her, as well as the young son, now in his late 20's. The DVD had some good extras, especially about Mr. Gardner and his in-put during filming. My favorite element of the film is that it involved very little racism. Mr. Gardner never complained that his bad luck was due to ""being Black"", and instead used his wit, wisdom and intelligence to make a seemingly hopeless stuation work to his ultimate advantage. He's a fine role model for ALL people who think they're at the rope's end. It CAN be done, as Mr. Gardner proved, and there are valuable lessons here, for those who take the time to let them soak in.

In the movie, Gardner is a medical product salesman who ends up splitting up with his wife and ends up homeless with his 5 year-old son. Determined to not give up, Gardner endures homelessness and ends up pursuing an internship for a stockbroker position at a major Wall Street investment firm. Despite the trials and tribulations Gardner went through, not only due to the lack of a roof over his head but also the hard work related to his internship and even an IRS seizure of his money to boot, Gardner's endurance and hard work pays off.

The movie, and I am sure the book, is a testament to how anyone can get themselves out of poverty and become wealthy with hard work, persistence  and determination. Gardner had an even bigger reason to work hard due to the need for him to provide a good life for his son.

2745481,4,B000MRA59M,"Will Smith carries this film on his very sturdy shoulders and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has matured since his `Fresh Prince' days into a very fine actor.  His performance is layered, structured and intelligent, but amidst all of that he still comes across natural and refreshing, never forced or mechanical.  Every emotion runs through his blood effortlessly and full of believable conviction.  I've always been a fan of Smith, but here he returns to the brilliance he possessed in `Ali', coupling his on screen fire with heart and soul that transcends the meaningless boundary's of comic relief but that which leaves a deep rooted sense of character and warmth.  Smith disappears inside Christopher Gardener but he never loses himself, his charm and his commanding presence.

`The Pursuit of Happyness' tells the true life story of Christopher Gardener, a family man who gets wrapped up in the wrong pyramid scheme and ends up broke and homeless.  His wife Linda, played by Thandie Newton, walks out on him he's left desolate and alone.  The love for his son Christopher, played brilliantly by Smith's own son Jaden, is what keeps Gardener holding on in pursuit of a better life.

One thing that Christopher has going for him is potential.  He's a smart man with ambition and determination and so when he sees an opportunity to rise above himself through an internship with a law-firm he takes it despite the fact of no pay and he uses it to better himself and his surroundings.  Smith's wide range of emotions are what keeps this story compelling and entertaining, from his sadness and grief stricken situation to his cheerful demeanor he masquerades in for his sons sake to that emotional clap of relief as he realizes his dreams amidst a crowded sidewalk, Smith breaks down his own barriers and builds for himself a place alongside the acting giants of today.

With pros there must also exist cons, and those cons appear in a few different forms.  The first form is that of co-star Thandie Newton who develops a bad habit of repelling the viewer.  Her character, while unsympathetic in general, is overly unsympathetic not to mention a tad-bit annoying, and that's putting it nicely.  Where's that girl I saw in `Crash' who stole the entire show from her co-stars, who electrified the screen and screamed ""nominate me""?  She's lost albeit in a mess of a character who could have been so much more but turned out so much worse than anticipated.  The flow of the film is a bit choppy as well.  Some parts flow by effortlessly while others drag on and even get a bit redundant.  The director at times tries too hard to emphasize Gardeners destitute condition when that said condition is already made apparent enough for the average viewer.

That said, there is still a lot of good to remember when recalling this film, and Will Smith's brilliant performance is reason enough to watch it at least once.  I also must mention Smith's young son Jaden who perfectly compliments his father's passion by effortlessly mastering his performance which is sympathetic, controlled and elegant, never over the top or exaggerated like it could have been.  He comes across as poised as his father and as at home in his performance as an actor who's been doing this all his life.  One day this young actor will reach the feats his father has, and with a beginning as strong as this one he may end up there sooner than later.

When Chris' wife leaves him, he is forced to take care of his son (played by Smith's real life son Jaden), all the while struggling to keep from going under financially. Gardner then lands a dream job as an intern for a major stockbroker firm, only to find out it is a non-paying position. He must come out on top in the program if he hopes to land a paying gig. Meanwhile, Chris and his son are forced to live on the streets.

This a classic story about not giving up and fighting for what you want. This is possibly Will Smith's strongest role to date, and his performance is exceptional. Smith brings Gardner's story to life. A story that is full of heartache, despair, darkness, and most importantly...hope. I'll admit this is a tough one to watch..especially for parents. One of the most heart-breaking scenes is when Chris and his son are forced to spend the night in a subway bathroom. As the movie goes on you will find yourself asking the question: How much can one man take?  But if you stick around until the end you will be touched and inspired. Hard to watch? Sure. Worth it? Absolutely!",1182297600,2,1389,4.359073359073359

2745486,4,B000MRA59M,"""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is an unabashed tearjerker about the American Dream and commitment to family in the face of great odds. It was inspired by the true story of Chris Gardner, who spent some time in the 1980s homeless while trying to care for his young son and make it through a stockbroker internship. The film is fictionalized but stays true to Gardner's struggle for success and dedication to his son. Gardner's autobiography, which goes by the same title, was actually published after the film was written. In San Francisco, 1981, Chris Gardner (Will Smith) can't make ends meet selling portable bone density scanners, while his embittered wife Linda (Thandie Newton) waitresses 2 shifts a day. Chris spies a man with an enviable sportscar on the street one day and asks him what he does for a living. He's a stockbroker. So Chris decides that's what he'll be. He must be at the top of his class after 6 months in Dean Witter's competitive internship program to be hired. Meanwhile, Chris has no wife, no money, no paying job, and a 5-year old son (Jaden Smith).

A story of hardship and hard work, paternal love and frustration, could easily be too saccharine for words. It's saved from this fate by Chris Gardner's desperation. Behind his indomitable pluck, Gardner is truly desperate. He has no money, no home, uncertain prospects, and the responsibility of providing for a young child. He hides his circumstances from his colleagues. He's spends an inordinate amount of energy chasing errant bone scanners around town. He compromises his ethics. His single-mindedness eventually takes a toll on his son. Chris is struggling for his life. And his financial problems are something the audience can understand and may themselves fear. That's why ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" works so well. Credit is due Will Smith's Oscar-nominated performance and Italian director Gabriele Muccino's understanding of intense emotions painted with small strokes.

The DVD (Sony 2007): There are 4 featurettes, the song ""I Can"" by Bebe Winans and Dave Koz (5 min, audio), and a feature commentary. ""Making Pursuit: An Italian Take on the American Dream"" (17 min) interviews Gabriele Muccino, Will Smith, and the producers about choosing Muccino to direct. Muccino talks about filming in San Francisco and working in English. ""Father and Son: On Screen and Off"" (7 min) recounts casting Jaden Smith after auditioning hundreds of other children, and Will Smith talks about working with his son. ""The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner"" (12 min) interviews Gardner about his participation in the film, and Will Smith talks about learning from him. ""Inside the Rubik's Cube"" (6 min) is a fun short documentary on the persistent popularity of the Cube. There is a nice audio commentary by director Gabriele Muccino, in English. Muccino tells us how he got the job, discusses themes, recreating the 1980s, Will Smith's trust, locations, and some technical details.

2745498,4,B000MRA59M,"I am a big fan of Will Smith and this movie is in  a different genre than the other films I have seen him in.  It was a really good movie and it kept my attention.  It really shows just how difficult it is when you are a single parent trying to make it financially, emotionally, and spiritually.  Although he slept many nights in a homeless shelter, or one night in a bathroom at the subway station...he continued to be a good role model for his son.  The part that made me cry is when it showed him donating blood to get $20.

I would have really liked to have seen some parts of him as a successful man but the movie ended too soon. Once again, Will Smith done a great job and in my opinion he is better than the movie.  But...I will recommend it to anyone that likes drama.",1181088000,,776,4.065789473684211
2745499,4,B000MRA59M,"The Pursuit of Happyness, set in San Francisco in 1981, is based on the one-year struggle of Chris Gardner, a self made millionaire, had with being homeless and constantly trying to find a shelter for his son and himself while working an internship at Dean Witter. This movie is based on the autobiography of Chris Gardner. His book illustrated his abusive childhood and growing up in an atmosphere lacking love and never seeing his father. Gardner pledged to become a father of love and care for his children. After encountering many hardships, Gardner finally succeeded in the business world. But as a docudrama, this movie oversimplifies the complex issues of race and never explained why such a genuine man could suffer so much, why so many blacks were wandering aimlessly seeking for a shelter and portraying black wives as bitter and heartless women.

Will smith stars as Chris Gardner, and Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son) is Chris Gardner's son. Will smith does a flawless performance in showing one man's reach for the impossible dream. He becomes Chris Gardner and suffered the hardships. It seems as though this movie is set in the attempt of preparing Will Smith for yet another Oscar Nomination with his preparations for the movie such as growing out a beard and bringing in his own son. His performance with his son Jaden sparked the real fatherhood and the love a man has for his own son. In the scenes of suffering, one can see in the eyes of Will Smith, his fatherly love, rather than trying to find emotion with a professional child actor. Especially in the scene when smith screams at his son for wanting Captain America back. The mix of frustration, coldness and love showed through his eyes and pierced the hearts of the audience. Thandie Newton stars as Chris Gardner's wife Linda, who shows the bitterness and craziness a woman working double shifts as a hotel struggling to live with her own husband.

An interesting character also appears at the end of the movie as Christopher ells his knock knock jokes. The real Chris Gardner appears and nods at Smith. This is a successful crossover of reality and the persona of Gardner because it blends together the real and the fictional.

But it seem as though this film is produced for Will Smith rather than produced being an accurate docudrama and making the audience feel the motions of a guy trying to pursue happiness despite his harsh environment. Although in Chris Gardner's autobiography he actually encounters countless hardships and finally succeeds, when put into a film it feels as though it may be a bit too clich&eacute; for a man to run into worse and worse situations, overcoming them and finally succeeding in becoming a self-made millionaire.

Most of the movie, we see Smith chasing hippies and old people over a Density Bone Scanner, and by the end of the movie, it seems a though these are the scenes we remember and less of the hardships he encounters. More emphasis should have been put into creating the realistic atmosphere where Gardner becomes devastated by his circumstances and his frustrations. One of the only times we encounter and feel his uneasiness is when he is in the phone booth calling his wife and she tells him she's leaving. Without much explanation provided to allow the audience to further connect with him, Gardner becomes just another black man suffering on the streets with the countless others and luckily brought on screen to show the world.

Most of the debate though, lies in the oversimplification on the issues of racism and poverty of blacks. In the film when Gardner and his son are running in Glide Church, blacks were portrayed as aimlessly circling the streets and waited for a place to go. This film doesn't provide an explanation as to why they are. Blacks in San Francisco were constantly discriminated against in the 1970s, making lives extremely cruel for them. It was difficult for them to find decent work besides domestic labor and there was a major influx of African Americans into San Francisco to find jobs in the wartime industry.

It seems as though this movie undermines the situation when showing Gardner's successful ob interview without a suit or tie, covered in paint and previously spending a night in jail. Although the aimlessly wandering blacks were there partially to portray the reality, the audiences have no connection or clue as to what the situation in the 1970s was like. The movie is made as though 1970s was a prosperous and integrating time. But in reality, 1970s was plagued by stagflation, which is high inflation and high unemployment rates. But if the audience did not know their history, blacks may just seem like a bunch of homeless people wandering around the streets. Perhaps showing short scenes of other blacks struggling to find jobs and being rejected would've made this a better docudrama.

Gardner's story is supported to be one that inspires youngsters to never give up and stay strong. But in reality, the series of events that happened within the two hours of the movie actually happened within a relative number of years. This two hour packed portrayal of Gardner's life distorted Chris Gardner's life and makes it an inaccurate account of Chris Gardner's life. Gardner became a multi-millionaire who is an influential speaker and who continues to help people with his own power. The director seems to have focused too much on piecing together a well-rounded character that he forgot to put in the edges to Chris Gardner such as his hobbies and what he plays with his son so that we, the audience, can connect to.

This movie is of a black man's simple life and a struggle to reach for the impossible. There were some times when we could feel the love between Gardner and his son, but by the end of the movie, one already feels too tired from the chasing of the Density Bone Scanner and anger from the distorted life of Chris Gardner that we don't become inspired by the actual story of a man trying to pursue happiness.",1181088000,3,5994,4.818270165208941

2745501,1,B000MRA59M,"I went into this movie thinking I was going to see an inspiring story of someone overcoming adversity. What it delivered was a hokey attempt to pull at the viewer's heart strings with an overly depressing and contrived set of circumstances.

A well made movie understands how to tease the moviegoer with waves of sadness, relief, and joy. The director threw all that out the window and leaves you depressed for 115 minutes and happy for 2 minutes. The problem is that the viewer is so inundated with the negative that we begin to resent the movie as a disingenuous attempt to appeal to our sympathies. By the time the climax, and only non-depressing moment of the movie, comes the viewer no longer cares about the outcome of the film or for the well being of the characters.

In addition, upon further analysis of the movie one can only come to the inescapable conclusion that Will Smith's character is a bad role model and a poor father figure. Not only do we have to watch him continually make bad life decisions, but we also have to witness him force his son from his mother, who had a steady job and residence, only to neglect him in day care and force him to sleep in homeless shelters and public toilets. In addition, all of this hardship is under the pretense of him getting a better job and a better life. However, by all definitions the job he is attempting to get is a pipe dream, akin to winning the lottery. So not only  is he gambling with his future, but more importantly, he is gambling with his son's future.

In the end one can't help but to feel that he neither deserves the job nor the company of his son. And although he may now be a multi-millionaire in real life, we the viewers will always know that when push came to shove, he unfairly made his own selfish desires a priority over the well being of his son.",1180828800,21,1831,4.408284023668639

I agree that this movie comes to an abrute conclusion and would have liked to seen more of his success and the success of his son, but I have a feeling that would lead to disappointment.

My family enjoyed watching and I will probably watch it a couple more times, but don't see it as my go to movie for getting me out of a rute or inspiring me to do great things, just the things that I have to do.",1180656000,,684,4.08955223880597
2745504,4,B000MRA59M,"Not even in BELOVED has a film director let Thandie Newton look so unglamorous and everyday.  You might pass her on the street without a second glance, which I think freed up something in Newton, allowing her to do some of her very best work here.  Of course she has a thankless part because nobody cares about her anyhow, as everyone has pointed out.  It's sort of like the way Meryl Streep is treated in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, except here she doesn't even get to come back at the end, not even a phone call to let her boy know she made it safely to New York.

Am I the only one who watched all the extras to this movie and tried in vain to find out what happened to the little boy?  What's the mystery all about.  We find out in every corner of the menu that Chris Gardner became the most successful black enterpreneur of all time.  But what about the son?  Is he even alive?  Hope I'm not putting my foot in my mouth, but I'm curious.

When Chris sells his bone scanning machine to the kindly doctor, he cashes his check at Ted's Market, which is on my block South of Market here in San Francisco.  There are big blowup photos all over the deli counter, shots of Will and Chris making nice with the store workers and other neighbors.  It's always fun to see a movie filmed in San Francisco, and I hate those people who quibble about locations, but if you live here you will laugh when you see that every San Francisco park seems to have a BART entrance at the corner, whereas in real life BART is built to service the most builtup sections of the Bay Area, not the country club locations.  I hate people like myself who nitpick about these matters!

Finally, I better duck from the rotten tomatoes, but in my opinion little Jaden Christopher Smith is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen, and I give Will the same credit I gave Aaron Spelling for trying to make Tori a star despite unpromising credentials.",1180569600,,1916,4.315642458100559
2745505,4,B000MRA59M,"The Pursuit of Happyness stars Will Smith, who plays Chris Gardner, in an emotional drama based on a true story. Set in 1981, Chris is a struggling medical equipment salesman. Chris is a smart guy, but made the mistake of selling medical equipment in which he had to buy all the product up front and then finds out no one wants the stuff.  So, Chris has a wife that basically hates him and a job that isn't paying and bills that are due. With his life going down the tubes, Chris sees the lifestyles that the successful stockbrokers have and wants it. He applies for an internship and gets it, but finds out the job doesn't pay a salary. Then his wife leaves him and his young son, played by Smith's actual son.

Chris juggles daycare and bills and selling the medical equipment while trying to learn the ins and outs of selling stocks. Eventually, the bills catch up with him and Chris and his son are homeless, forced to fight for places in line at homeless shelters.

This movie was a successful Christmas blockbuster and the preview packs an emotional punch. I expected a feel-good tear jerker, but what I got was a drama without the highs and lows expected from the genre.  The problem I saw is the lack of conflict. Sure, Chris is homeless and poor, but we know he eventually succeeds.  Also, every executive Chris encounters treats him nicely or with respect, so we never see Chris as the object of ridicule that he could have been considering his at time rough appearance.  This is a well made movie and entertaining, but it moves along at a predictable pace

By no means do I think this is a bad movie. I highly recommend it. Smith is excellent, his kid (Jaden Smith) isn't as good of an actor as some have said. Especially enjoyable is Chris's interaction with some of the Dean Witter clients and his ploy to get free tickets to a San Francisco 49ers game.

2745546,5,B000MRA59M,"Moviegoers don't have to wait for Atlas Shrugged to view a riveting drama about the heroics of a business entrepreneur. Actor Will Smith shines in his portrayal of a real-life, self-made investment broker in this emotionally exhausting but ultimately inspiring biopic.

It's the 1981 recession, and Chris Gardner struggles to make ends meet as a self-employed medical-equipment salesman who has a family to support in San Francisco. With a stack of bone-density scanners gathering dust in his efficiency apartment kitchen, and with wife Linda (Thandie Newton) pulling double shifts at a neighborhood laundry, he can barely pay the bills. Chris spends his days shuttling his five-year-old son, Christopher, to day care (the film's title refers to Chris's constantly nagging the owner of the day-care center to correct the word's spelling on a mural there) and trying to hawk his expensive equipment to doctors and hospitals with shrinking budgets.

Looking for a way out of his dead-end job, Chris spots a well-heeled businessman (Geoff Callan) parking a red Ferrari and quizzes him. ""Man, I've got two questions for you: What do you do, and how do you do it?"" The man informs him he's a stock broker with the prestigious Dean Witter Reynolds firm and that he's ""good with numbers and people.""

Suddenly, Chris sees his life as it could be. Watching the men and women exiting the brokerage house, he reflects, ""They all looked so damned happy to me,"" and wonders, ""Why couldn't I look like that?"" After impressing one of the senior brokers (Brian Howe) by solving a Rubik's Cube puzzle during a taxicab ride, Chris applies for a Dean Witter internship program and lands an interview.

However, all that Linda can see in Chris's decision to become a broker is a pipe dream. ""Salesman to intern is backwards,"" she protests. Unable to handle the stress of the landlord breathing down their necks for back rent, she leaves, forcing Chris to raise their son alone. As if that weren't enough, on the night before his big interview with Dean Witter, the police show up at his doorstep to arrest him for a pile of unpaid parking tickets.

After spending the night in the police lockup, Chris--disheveled, wearing jeans and a tank-top undershirt--barely makes it to his interview on time. ""I could not think of a lie bizarre enough,"" he explains awkwardly to his skeptical interviewers. ""I just got out of jail for unpaid parking tickets and my wife left me."" One asks him: ""What if a man walked in here with no shirt, and I gave him a job?"" Chris replies good-naturedly: ""He must've had on some really nice pants.""

Chris lands a spot in the internship program, not by bluffing his way out of the awkward situation, but through his forthright honesty and sense of humor.  However, there's a catch--the internship is unpaid and will last six months. Even after the program ends, there are no guarantees: only one intern out of twenty will be hired by the firm.

Already having moved with his son into a hotel room to save money, Chris is faced with the dilemma of either trying to provide fully for his son right away or taking the chance that after a half-year he'll land a salaried position as an investment broker. Figuring that he can make rent and keep Christopher in day care if he can sell just one bone-density scanner a month after work and on weekends, he decides to go for it. (In this regard, the movie takes a little dramatic license: In Chris Gardner's real life, the internship paid a small stipend each month, and he quit his job selling the scanners when he took the internship; he was not self-employed.)

But his troubles are just starting. When the IRS seizes his checking account for back taxes, Chris and his boy are evicted from their hotel room. With only the clothes on their backs, they are turned out on the streets. But whether sleeping on subways, buses, or in luncheonette booths, Chris never leaves Christopher's side or reveals a hint of discouragement.

As much as The Pursuit of Happyness is the story of Chris Gardner's struggle to succeed in the business world, it's also the story of a father's love for and commitment to his child. At their lowest point--forced to spend the night sleeping on the floor of a men's room in a train station--he never lets on to his boy that their state is desperate, even as he's about to go to pieces. Much like the Roberto Benigni character in 1997's Life Is Beautiful, Chris conceals the indignity of their situation from his youngster by playing a make-believe game of hiding from cavemen and dinosaurs. The scenes between father and son are among the movie's most natural, convincing, and genuinely moving, no doubt because of the bond between Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden, who plays Christopher.

At one point, while shooting hoops at a neighborhood playground, Chris realizes the power that an adult's words can have on a child. He makes a self-effacing quip, telling Christopher not to bother spending too much time working on his game because he himself was never any good at basketball, either. The boy puts down the ball and slumps in resignation. Angry at himself for his own thoughtlessness, Chris counsels his son:

Don't ever let someone tell you you can't do something! Not even me!. . . .You got a dream, you gotta protect it! People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period!

What makes this movie ring so true is that Chris Gardner heeds his own advice, even though he seems trapped in an inescapable maze. Constantly down but never out, he refuses to slink away and abandon his dream. His quest becomes a frantic chase: rushing to catch buses, arriving late at sales calls, picking up his son from daycare, tracking down a bone scanner that some hippies stole from him, securing a place to sleep in a homeless shelter. But homelessness is never depicted--or regarded--as more than a transient condition. And Chris Gardner is always in transit: everywhere he goes, he's running. Indeed, I believe Smith spends more screen time running than Dustin Hoffman did in the 1976 thriller Marathon Man.

Unlike the anti-business messages conveyed by so many of today's movies, this film depicts the business world as gruelingly tough, but ultimately fair--even liberating. Most refreshing are the scenes showing Chris in the Dean Witter internship program. I cheered to myself as he applied his quick head for numbers, shaving seconds off ""cold calls"" by not hanging up between phone conversations and by going straight to the top of a company's contact directory rather than starting at the bottom, as is customary.

In many respects, The Pursuit of Happyness reminded me of business-themed comedies from the 1980s, such as Trading Places and Working Girl, but without the bitter ""getting even with the boss"" side plots. If anything, the movie extols the productive nature of the stock market while regarding government as the parasite. While talking with a prospect who wants a retirement fund that yields high returns but low taxes, Gardner quips, ""So, basically, you don't want nobody's hands in your pockets but your own.""

Italian director Gabriele Muccino--best known for his 2001 romantic comedy The Last Kiss--adapts his lighthearted style effortlessly to this somewhat weighty story, his first American film. Meanwhile, director of photography Phedon Papamichael exploits the steep streets of San Francisco and Oakland as a metaphor to capture the ups and downs of Chris's world. In the Dean Witter offices, Papamichael's camera moves left-to-right, visually conveying the business world's virtues of drive, economy, and progression. For his part, Will Smith digs deep into his dramatically demanding role, giving his most forceful performance to date. Is this really the same easy-going guy who starred in ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" and Men in Black?

As for the real-life Chris Gardner, today he is a multi-millionaire who runs an investment firm in Chicago. Speaking about this stirring, feel-good movie (which, ironically, is at times also one of the bleakest movies I've ever seen), Gardner hailed the ability of Smith and director Muccino to capture life ""when the whole world tells you how small you are, but you see how big you really can be.""

And big he is. The Pursuit of Happyness is one of the most positive and heroic portraits of a businessman that I've ever seen. The choices that Chris Gardner makes under the most trying of circumstances reveal his indomitable, optimistic resolve and character. Smith, who produced as well as starred, first seized upon the idea of making this movie after seeing an ABC ""20/20"" profile of Gardner. ""Chris represents the American Dream,"" he remarked. ""The promise of America is such a great idea. Nowhere else in the world could a Chris Gardner exist.""

The result is Will's best performance in any film yet. Will himself (in the ""Making Persuit"" fetaurette on this DVD) proclaims this film as his greatest achievement to date.

I have to agree that choosing a European director was a very wise choice. It gives the film a realism and a point of view that would have been hard to find in a Hollywood director. Muccino's saw this as an ""American dream"" come true story, and how a father-son relationship should be.

The final scene, showing Gardner's final interview with the Big Bosses including his reaction once he gets outside the building, was possibly the most touching moment I have ever seen in a movie. His expression and reaction was so real, so emotional I couldn't help but cry with him for joy and for his pain through the journey. The perfect choice to end the film.

This is a great introduction to Will's son, Jaden. It shows that the filmmakers were reluctant to consider him at first. It was only after testing thousand of boys in three weeks (and not being happy with any of them) that director Gabriele Muccino asked the other producers if they thought it would be ok to audition Will's son. Jaden blew the other kids out of the water in the tests and the chemistry between him and Will made their relationship on film all the more real.

# The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner

This is a short featurette (8-9 minutes) with clips from an interview with the real Chris Gardner. It was interesting to learn that the real Reverend who ran the outreach center where Chris and his son stayed a few nights, Rev. Cecil Williams, played himself in the film. Chris Gardner insisted on it! The location was also the real place. Chris said that without Cecil Williams, thousands of San Fransisco's homeless (including Gardner) would be in desperate trouble or even dead. We also learn that the subway-bathroom where Chris and son spend a night was an exact replica of the real one. We learn that the director insisted they use real homeless people as extras to play many of the homeless! And many other interesting facts.

# Making Pursuit: An Italian Take on the American Dream

This is where we learn the most about the choice of Gabriele Muccino as director. A fantastic featurette documenting the making of the film, specifically experienced from a first-time English-speaking-movie director. Imagine directing actors and a crew in your second or third language and not being able to express your thoughts or ideas very well because you don't know the words! Fascinating how he pulled it off!

# Inside the Rubik's Cube

A short featurette (under 6-7 mins) about the rubics cube. It was invented by a Hungarian. In the 80's 1 out of 4 households had one. The HUGE success helped bring Hungary out of communism. And more history. Also a bit about ""cubing"" today.

# ""I Can"" Song (audio only)

A song written for the film, but not used in the theatrical release. Nice, but hard to *only* listen to a song (without seeing video attached) since this is a dvd.

# Audio commentary with director Gabriele Muccino

Commentaries are some of my favorite features on DVD's. But they are either hit or miss. This one was very good! Muccino starts off explaining how he got involved with the film (hand-picked by Will Smith) and his initial meetings with Will where they discussed their visions for the story. He described some of the challenges directing such a HUGE production, including the insane amount of extras in some scenes (he says American extras are the most professional he has ever encountered), to the period cars (some scenes had well over 100 cars from the period (early '80s), to how he selected and then directed some of the actors. He expresses his deep admiration and respect for Will Smith as an actor and how well Smith took critique and direction.

An EXCELLENT film with some great extras. I highly recommend this to anybody who loves their family and wants to pursue a dream! :)",1179273600,2,4284,4.752021563342318
2745553,4,B000MRA59M,"The Pursuit of Happyness is based on the true life story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith), a bone density scanner salesman seeking to make a career change in 1981 to become a stockbroker. He pursues his dream in spite of his wife leaving him, and insists on custody of his son, Christopher. He finally lands an unpaid, six-month internship, where only one of twenty candidates will be offered a paying job. Every obstacle imaginable is in his path, but father and son will just have to prevail.

I looked forward to seeing this movie with some trepidation. The title for one thing, had me on guard against the protaganist being some kind of misspelling apologist, and I am adamantly opposed to people of that kidney. Early on, however, I was disabused of that notion, and found instead that the central character was in fact, a correct spelling stickler. What a relief.

He is also a fan of the poetic writing of Thomas Jefferson in The Declaration of Independence, and in voice-over ruminates on how Jefferson , in his wisdom, realized that perfect happiness might not ever be possible, but was something that nevertheless, all had a right to pursue.

The other contributing factor to the aforementioned trepidation was that this retelling of the Horatio Alger rags-to-riches fable would be tedious drudgery. Too much hard work. This was not your usual Hollywood mindless entertainment, instant gratification for Live-For-The-Momentsters, but it was well worth the time and effort invested. Hard work, yes, but productive work that paid many dividends.

In a promotional appearance on a talk show (probably Letterman, since I eschew Leno) with his real life son Jaden Smith in tow (who also plays his character's son in the film), Will Smith bragged about what a great actor his son was. He had even given him advice pertaining to his own acting that had greatly enhanced his performance. I was very skeptical of this claim, because of course he would be biased in his son's favor. But, after seeing the film, I would have to agree with him. His son did a great job walking that tight rope between being cute, but not so damn cute that it becomes annoying.

A prime example of that is the kid who plays Bobby Jr. on the sitcom, All of Us: Khamani Griffin. In case you haven't seen it, the show was conceived and created by Will Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and is based on their own modern approach to raising kids with divorced parents, in evolving, caring relationships. Bobby Jr. is so repulsively cute that he would make anyone want to puke after watching him for five seconds. Surprisingly, that never happens in this movie, possibly because of the harrowing situations father and son goes through together.

Will Smith did some great acting here as well. One scene in a Metro/BART terminal restroom was very moving. Homeless, he and his son are forced to sleep there, and he tries to make it an adventure. He is lugging one of his unsold bone density scanners, which he has rescued from a crazy street person who believed it was a time machine. He tells his son it really is a time machine, and when they press the button, pretends they are back in the time of dinosaurs, and the restroom is a cave. He cries actual tears here, and is totally believable. Another scene with a Rubik's Cube shows another side of his thespian skills, as well as evoking 1981. Another scene where he must interview for the stockbroker internship in paint splattered jeans was well done. Don't ask why. Parking tickets. If you have ever lived in San Francisco, you would know what that was like.

In fact, San Francisco in 1981 was pretty much how it looked in this movie. Sometimes movies or TV Shows are set in San Francisco, but they get everything wrong. Like you know it was shot in LA, with just a few establishing shots of the Golden Gate Bridge thrown in, but totally in the wrong place. Suddenly Susan, Full House, Greg & Dharma--even Bullet, with Steve McQueen had him in the Tenderloin, and then on the next block, suddenly he was in The Marina. The crazy street person (John Robb) who thought his bone density scanner was a time machine was a bit jarring, like the tone suddenly shifted, and we were in a different, less realistic movie, or one of those stupid sitcoms, but since this was based on the real-life experience, I have no doubt that it probably happened exactly as depicted. All of the rest of the people were very believable, especially the stockbrokers. A friend of mine, who actually was a stockbroker intern during that same time and place concurred that it was pretty accurate.

Finally, I was pretty excited when I saw the opening credits and found that Thandie Newton was in it, but she didn't have much to do as his wife but nag and eventually leave him. Oh, well. That is a pursuit for another movie, I suppose.",1179187200,,4848,4.675263774912075

I have a JVC dual DVD/VHS machine less than two years old and this film will not play.  Anti-piracy software has been a problem that Sony acknowledges, and they cheerfully sent me another copy.  But that one doesn't play, either.  You can get to the menu, but when you hit ""Play Movie"" the DVD locks up.  If you go to the ""Special Features"" menu, you get a list, but no navigation icon, and the machine locks up again.

2745584,5,B000MRA59M,"Based on a story inspired by true events, Will Smith portrays Chris Gardner who is a salesman in San Francisco at a time in his life when everything is in a downward spiral.  After a series of difficult problems with his girlfriend, she walks out on Chris and her son and he is now confronted with the prospect of single parenting and all the challenges that go with it.

Determined to make a better life for him and his son, Chris accepts an unpaid internship position in a training program for stockbrokers.  Without a steady income, it is a painful time for father and son financially.  They are subsequently evicted from their apartment and then from a motel and finally they experience the reality of homeless shelters.

With the power of love dominating all else in their lives, Chris and his son feed off of each other's strengths and overcome each new obstacle thrown in their way.  With an iron will and an overwhelming desire to succeed, Chris Gardner overcomes heavy odds to eventually become very successful in his stockbroker career field.

I don't think I've ever seen Will Smith in such a dramatic and profound role.  He is about the only well know actor that I recognized throughout the movie and his performance is outstanding.  The storyline is, at times, a sad and depressing one but the build-up to the conclusion is nothing short of inspirational and uplifting with a classy, heartwarming ending.

`The Pursuit of Happyness' is a very good movie all the way around and it is very enjoyable to watch.  This is recommended to everyone.",1178928000,,1554,4.739776951672862

2745593,5,B000MRA59M,"This movie is one of the best, in my opinion, that has come around in a long time.  This movie made you have a connection with the characters.  By far Will Smith's best movie to date, he really conveys the hopefulness of the main character.

The only other thing I can say is; get ready for a rollercoaster of emotions, because that's what this movie gives you.",1178928000,,361,4.358208955223881
2745614,5,B000MRA59M,"If you have a heart, this one's a real tear jerker.  Look past the basic premise of a man trying to get a job.  See the movie very carefully:  it's about a man struggling for survival so that he and his sone can fulfill that American dream:  the pursuit of happiness.

You just feel bad for Chris Gardner in this movie.  No matter how hard he tried to do something, it seemed like he could never catch a break, but he never let that stop him from trying.  Your heart does go out to him on this one.  Despite the bad luck, he never let showed his son that he lost hope.  He always kept his chin up as he became more and more humbled in his situation.  That's why the end is so poignant and endearing.

I could barely see this movie because I cried so hard.  I knew from just watching the trailer that Will Smith would garner and Oscar nomination; however, it was a close call toss up between him and Forest Whitaker portraying General Idi Amin.  Really, really close.  I still would have picked Will Smith because this story seemed to resonate with me, and I would have given this the Oscar for Best Picture, as well, but things as they were, it did not come to pass.

I was surprised to learn that Will Smith and hisproducer John Lassiter actively sought Italian director Gabriele Muccino to direct this.  Muccino did ""the Las Kiss"" and ""Remember me, My Love"".  This whole movie experieince is based upon risk taking.  Will Smith took a risk on Gabriele Muccino to do this movie.  Muccino did a fabulous job being that this was his first non-Italian film ever.  Secondly, they auditioned so many kids to play the son of Chris Gardner, and they couldn't find any.  So they decided to give Will Smith's son a chance to read, and it turned out he was the best audition and he got cast.  So this is a first Father-son movie for Will Smith.  Thirdly, the whole movie centers aorund how the real Chris Gardner took a risk in his sales job to become a stock broker and after hitting a serious low and given his God-given chance, he finally becasme a success.

How does a movie like this not get Best Picture?  Well, it's a good story and worth the watch with a good lesson for all.",1178928000,,2174,4.308641975308642

2745616,5,B000MRA59M,"The true story of Chris Gardner is portrayed in this tear-jerking, extremely inspirational movie: Pursuit of Happyness.

Will Smith, playing the role of Gardner, does an excellent job of making the viewer feel what he is feeling; to feel his frustrations, his sadness, and the times he is filled with ""happyness.""

The only thing I would have changed about this movie is to add an additional scene to the movie, versus the text that is provided, that shows Gardner is his current day role; that is, a multimillionaire after establishing his brokerage firm.

Otherwise, the movie is perfect and a must see.  It is a true inspiration to anyone.  It is proof success is the reward for hard work and dedication, that is not based on the color of your skin or the financial status you are born into.",1178755200,,794,4.683453237410072

This disc is just like the Click Blu Ray version. What is up with Sony pictures? Their blu ray discs look terrible. I did once talk to a sales rep at the Sony store and he told me that Sony Blu Ray producted discs would play through component and not only through HDMI. I guess the reason why is that their discs are not in 1080. Don't get the blu ray version, stick to standard.",1178755200,4,510,4.009803921568627
2745618,3,B000MRA59M,"Based on a true story, 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' is the story of Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) and the difficulties in his life prior to ""making it"".  His wife Linda (played by Thandie Newton (Crash)) just can't take the hardships anymore and leaves.  Chris is left with custody of his son Christopher (played by Smith's own son Jaden Smith).

Chris suffers through many hardships, including eviction, staying in homeless shelters, tax collectors, and being jailed overnight for parking tickets.  He still manages to hang onto his son Christopher, even through devastating privation.  Chris is intent on selling a high end but spendy bone scanner machine to the medical community, but when his opportunity comes up to make a bid at becoming an employee of Dean Witter, he decides to go for it despite the unpaid time and attention it will take from his despairing life.

Chris obtains a one in a lifetime shot, by hard work alone, to obtain the position he dreamed of.  But as one other reviewers put it, we never get the chance to see Chris on the high end of his hard work.  The movie would have been better if it had shown the results of Chris's dedication and determination.  Instead, we're left in the darkness of his becoming, with a few on-screen announcements intended to satisfy our need for closure of Chris's troubles.

While very well done, the movie only earns three stars from me because of the abrupt ending.  It's one thing to document someone's hardship, but if (as in real life as the movie portrays) there is a happy ending, then the movie should include the happy ending.  I didn't sit through all this anguish for nothing.  Worth a rent, it's up to you for a purchase.  Enjoy!",1178668800,4,1705,4.696969696969697

2745620,4,B000MRA59M,"This may be; no, this is Will Smith's best work to date. Even the Ali performance was more Smith than Ali. Some actors have such big personalities that it's hard to see them as the characters they're trying to portray. Except for 'The Legends of Bagger Vance' and the 'Fresh Prince' characters, most of Will Smith's performances have fallen into this category; which is hard to believe given his bankability. But 'The Pursuit of Happyness,' may take Will Smith's career in a new direction. I know he's already successful, I'm referring to his ability to play more realistic down to earth characters; characters with more substance. I usually approach these type (a black-man struggles to prove himself worthy and make it in a predominantly white mans field) films with a bit of trepidation. In truth, I generally hate these type films, because I'm always forced to ask myself why? Why do black men seeminlgly have such a hard time (both past and present) in a country that touts fairness and equality as it's cornerstone in the job market, the courts, etc. But this film was a refreshing departure from the quintessential feel-racially-sorry for that guy piece. It was a vindication of sorts for the determined. Smith finally takes you to a place where you momentarily forget it's him and follow the character. The performance by his son was also believable. Be advised though, the character had so many set backs it get's a bit tiresome to watch him rebound yet again. I would've liked to see the Chris Gardner character enjoy some of his well-deserved success. Living with new-found success is sometimes just as hard as the pursuit. This film ultimately works because of it's refreshingly new approach. Since it was directed by Italian director Gabriele Muccino, it's a film that centers on undying determination, not race!",1178409600,,1825,4.947882736156352
2745621,5,B000MRA59M,"Will Smith's BEST acting work to date.  Chris Gardner's story is so important for kids to see.  Those who are less fortunate can find hope.  Those who have never lacked will see there is another side, and hopefully appreciate what they have a bit more.  It is also an important film for Black men who society has told all their lives that they can only go so far.  And it's a film for fathers to see.  Those who left their kids and those who stayed the struggle.

The Pursuit of Happyness shows a man almost accepting of his struggle in life.  Mounting bills --- so what, people will wait until tomorrow.  Unhappy wife --- she'll be happy tomorrow.  Then it hits the fan.  But instead of folding and crumbling in self-pity, or relinquishing his son, this man chooses to take a chance he knows has the best possibility for a secure, long term pay off.

There are so many lessons in this film on attitude, self-worth and never giving up on the right thing.  In such a competitive environment, the film showed what to do to keep up with and pass the competition.  This man had drive.  At the Day Care, I was glad they showed a Dad being concerned with the care of his son.  It was good to see a Dad answering his sons questions and never ignoring him.  And even though the showing of his elation was brief, I cried.  For all the struggle, the breath of relief was a huge one.

The  DVD made me appreciate it even more.

Among the special features on the DVD is ""Making Pursuit..."" where Will Smith and his co-producer talk about how they decided on the director, an Italian who can barely communicate in English! (Probably the crucial choice for the wonderful results.) There's a segment about how Jaden Christopher Syre Smith came to be cast in the movie, and another segment on Chris Gardner, on whose biography the movie was based.

They even included a piece about all the interesting aspects of the Rubik's cube! (You've heard of people solving it blindfolded, but have you seen someone do it with just one hand?) Aside from the the usual director's commentary and previews, the DVD also has an audio-only track of ""I Can,"" a song by Bebe Winans and Dave Koz, which was inspired by the movie but not included in the theatrical release.

I realize this is based off a true story.

After going through this fire with Mr. Gardner, we're only rewarded with three minutes of elation and a placard telling us he went on to be a multi-millionaire.  I feel emotionally short-changed.  I mean we don't even see how much the job went on to pay him.  However, Chris Gardner's story will make the people who are settling for mediocre re-evaluate.

2745638,5,B000MRA59M,"There is a scene in this amazing movie that really stood out for me and I don't think I'm really giving anything away by relating it to you all, but anyway, Chris Gardener is at the schoolyard with his son and his son is playing basketball and he shoots and makes a basket. Chris Gardener tells his son that he'll probably be good at a lot of things in life, but he'll probably be lousy at basketball just like he was. And in an instant, you can see the joy draining out of his son's eyes. Gardener realizes what he just told his son and says something truly amazing, ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can do - not even me. People like to tell you that you can't do something because they can't. If you want something in this world, go out and get it...""

How many of us had big, huge dreams as a kid and then somebody (usually someone very close and dear to us) told us to be ""realistic""? And so we grow up...supposedly...and we forget about those dreams, those wishes, those visions we had when we were younger and we get into jobs that we hate only because it pays the bills and keeps a roof over our head and puts food on the table but deep down in our gut we know that we ""sold out"".

This movie inspired me greatly. It made me look at what I really want in my life in every area. It made me realize that age is nothing but a number and it's okay to have dreams and visions. Gardener did. Even when it looked at though he ""lost"" everything he still had the love and the admiration of his devoted son, and that love propelled him to new heights because that is what love does. It also got me to forgive my dad for a lot of things he told me growing up as a kid. I know he was only trying to keep me safe and not get hurt by having outlandish dreams of what I wanted to be, do, and have because in many ways, he gave up his dreams by raising a family. I don't know if it was a sacrafice, but he defintely renounced certain things in order to put food on the table and clothes on our backs.

This movie filled me to overflowing with joyful tears at the end. It's the kind of movie that makes you glad to not only be human but a human being and that is what we are really here for - to be - not to simply exist, not to always be doing, but to be and in that beingness we strive to leave the world just a little bit better than it was before we got here.

Chris Gardner surmounted unbelievable odds in order to maintain custody  of and provide for his young son. He became a stock market phenomenon. Everytime he was knocked down, he got right back up.  Will Smith was amazing!  *SPOILERS*  The two scenes that touched me the most were when he is holding his sleeping son on the floor of a public restroom where they spent the night, and when he is given the news that he has been chosen from a group of 20 applicants who have worked and studied (for six months without pay) for Dean Witter Investment company.

2745641,3,B000MRA59M,"""The Pursuit of Happiness"" tells the story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a lower middle class black man whose dream of prosperity is evaporating. He and his wife invested heavily in a portable bone densitometer, but sales are horrible and the family is just a step ahead of eviction. Slowly but surely, Chris loses nearly everything, until he is left almost literally with nothing but his young son (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) and the clothes on his back. By luck, he connects with a group of E.F. Hutton employees and starts a long and uncertain trip out of his predicament.

The film does a phenomenal job of communicating just how difficult it can be to rise from the margins, even if one is talented and ambitious. Gardner must feed and house his son while studying for a soul-crushing investment exam, showing up to work fresh every day and managing child care. The difficulties he faces are enormous and daunting, and would have deterred many a less hardy soul.

Spoilers ahead.

But from a filmic perspective, there were problems. How many close calls can a viewer endure without getting irritated? And using the name of a real investment firm pretty much gives away the ending. Then too, there was the lack of emotional intensity between the characters, with the exception of Jaden, who was delightful and real throughout. One had to wonder as well about the likelihood that a man who washed himself in subway bathrooms could be fresh -- both mentally and aromatically - every day for months. And without once cutting corners in the childcare area.

""Pursuit of Happiness"" is a fine movie that depicts the experience of individuals who are dogged about achieving their dreams. But it does so at the cost of its own integrity, shortchanging the damage that such a pursuit, no matter how well-motivated, has on those around them. By the end of the film, I was unconvinced by Chris Gardner's sterling character and mistrustful of the depiction of his money-grubbing dream as worthy of his efforts.",1177459200,,2016,4.851744186046512

2745657,4,B000MRA59M,"With Will Smith and apparently his young son, we get a stirring and heart-string-tugging movie about perseverance and stick-to-it-ness.

For me, the movie was almost painful to watch, been there done that. Eaten with kids one meal per day at the St Vincent de Paul's, sold plasma, lived on the streets. It was not a pleasant movie by any means, i left the room several times. I can admire his drive, often i wish i had that kind of ambition, or recently that my kids had it.

But the movie was, for me, like that old joke: the pilot comes on the loudspeaker and says, i got good news and i got bad news. The good news is that we are making excellent time, the bad news is that we are completely lost.

The movie presents the high side and the low side of economic life in this culture. The main character traverses this spectrum on his way down. Yet his salvation is his perseverance, his ability to sacrifice everything but his son for the task at hand---getting through the internship and grabbing the brass ring of money, and influence, and power and all good things that flow from this trinity.

He doesn't seem to question the monetization of all relationships. He loses a friend over a $14 debt, his wife lives because she wants a provider not a dreamer. But most importantly he nevers seems to questions the structure, the way things are. Why is the internship unpaid, they make plenty of money for the business, it is little different that that rabbit at the dogtrack, a distant carrot to incite a herculean effort to achieve it. Why are so many smart, hard working, educated people racing with the rats? when they really must know that 5% is a high percentage of winners. And what do they really win? and what do they sacrifice? what does the society sacrifice when all relationships are monetized? When a ballgame is just another way to meet people to sell them things or services or whatever?

The business of America is business. phewy, life is not about making money, and he ought to have realized that when his wife left and when he hugs his kid. Friendships are not about selling things, but about sharing. But we live in a society where tupperware parties happen in the church, where phone numbers and bank statements are interchangable, for people become commodities, to be bought and sold in the ever expanding marketplace.

Sure it was a touching movie, i remember our rule #1: the family stays together. Certainly a large number of people are: one marital fight from the street, or one paycheck, or one commission sale. or 2 plasma sales this week. or a cart full of aluminum cans. The question is not how a single person can rise above such and make a multimillion sale, but why we created and sustain this stupid economy that grinds down not just the poor but everyone. That grinds up the things of this world to make unneccessary bone density machines and then sells them as a dream. Movies can tell us a lot about ourselves, the fact that a black man, a single father, living on the streets, can make it in the white monied world of stockbrokers and penthouse suites at the ballgame is a tribute to the way America has changed. But more importantly how it's dreams of a good life have infected all people here, not just those descented from the recent elites. But more importantly how you could have a movie showing this life, from a bright and talented man's viewpoint and yet not at all challenge the circumstances of his life and why things are the way they are.

That is my big issue with the movie, so he gets ahead and makes lots of money. Doesn't he feel anything for those who didn't? Doesn't he have a real relationship with any of the bums in the shelter? or are they incapable of being leads and prospects. It's a good movie, worthwhile watching, but i really would like to have seen some thoughtful challenge of circumstances not just the perseverance to overcome them.",1176940800,2,3905,4.554131054131054
2745658,4,B000MRA59M,"If you're not a feel-good person, it's still okay to watch THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS. Although it has some of those moments, it stands out more as a story of human struggle than a touchy-feely film. That it's based on the real-life events of Chris Gardner also increases its emotional heft as the story pulls you in. But there is a bit of cheating that must be mentioned....

Most of the story's impact comes from the father/son relationship between Chris (Will Smith, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) and his son Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). The interactions between these two are so natural and effortless that it makes watching the film a sheer joy. But herein lay the trap. If any other young actor had played beside Will Smith, I don't think it would've come off as easy. But one can't blame the film team for making this decision. Jaden Smith was the perfect choice, no matter how unfair it might seem to other father/son film's that struggle with the easy-going nature of similar characters.

Viewing one man's dogged determination to maintain a functioning relationship with his son would be admirable in today's society no matter what. Especially coming from a financially destitute and broken family. That Chris Gardner refused to give up on his dream of becoming a successful father and businessman is felt throughout the movie as Will Smith's Academy Award nominated performance comes tumbling off the screen. Losing everything only to scramble back up and be repeatedly challenged is nothing new to cinema, but Smith's completely believable performance is something of a wonder. The real Chris Gardner put himself on loan to Smith and the production so that everything had that authentic feel. It also meant that there were fewer liberties taken with the story, as Gardner wouldn't allow certain omissions or changes.

The big surprise, though, was Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. His corny jokes, tickle-fests, vivid imagination (dinosaurs?), and touching dialogue all moved the story into brighter territory during the darkest times. Thandie Newton (CRASH) also plays well as Smith's alienated wife but has little screen time.

Learning to never give up on your dreams is something we can all take to the bank. And Mr. Gardner certainly did. He's now a multimillionaire who's assisting the poor in the very San Francisco neighborhood where this sobering story takes place. Giving back to the homeless shelters and getting notice out about hunger in our own cities, Chris Gardner is not only a success, he's smart and thoughtful. If for no other reason than that, you should watch The Pursuit of Happyness.

(Note: At the very end of the film, the real Chris Gardner has a cameo spot while wearing a very expensive suit. The film makers did this in order to show how far the Mr. Gardner had come.)",1176854400,,2829,4.947368421052632

Can it get any worse? It does. This film does not pull any punches or play it for cheap maudlin sentiment, you take this man's journey and you feel his angst, disappoinment's and eventual joy. When you are down and out and everything is going wrong, hang on and never let go, Chris Gardner's life is an example of what perserverance can pay off. The man is now a multi-millionaire.

2745661,3,B000MRA59M,"The recent '06 release of the DVD `The Pursuit of Happyness"" provides the vehicle of yet another great performance by Will Smith, the next Denzel Washington. However the perfect vechicle for a one man tour-de-force does not always translate into the perfect movie.

Not that this isn't a good film, it just isn't as good as Will Smith. Yes, the film is based on a true, inspirational story and Will's real life son Jaden, playing his on screen son is adorable. There are also numerous enjoyable performances by the supporting cast, specially the homeless guy (John Robb) looking for a time machine. Product values are superior throughout and the storyline possesses both depth and character. The problem is that Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) personal crisis goes on too long and by the time things are finally turning positive the film abruptly ends and the audience is denied the opportunity to sit back for a moment and relish the emotional high from his accomplishment.

A good film, definitely something you should see. Repeatability factor? Once is enough for me. My rating 3  Stars.",1176681600,26,1087,4.961538461538462
2745662,5,B000MRA59M,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  So did a great many others.  It took in more than $160 million in the U. S. and over $300 million worldwide.  Why?  Because everyone knows more about hard times than they care to admit.  We know what its like to be up against it financially, have a period in our lives when it is hard to pay the rent or make the mortgage payment.  While most of us haven't had to use a men's room as sleeping accommodations, we know what it is like to want to care for our children and have times when we can't provide for them as we would like. Most people know what it is like to have more meals of macaroni and cheese or ramen noodles than they would choose to have if they had more green in their wallets. Many more people know what a shutoff warning from the utility company looks like than would tell you about it.

We know what it is like to have dreams and to pursue them under pressure and against tough odds.  We know what it is like to want to teach our kids about life and then later regret giving them our own disappointments rather than the truth and how that might sap their own dreams and vitality - the gifts of youth - and to want to take those words back.

Almost all marriages have tough times.  Not every marriage collapses, but the pressures of life have killed marriages that could have made it under different circumstances.  We know what it is like to make a mistake in choosing a bad job and having to work our way out of it.

For these reasons, and many more, we relate to this movie.  It is terrific.  And the performances by Will and Jaden Smith are something quite special.  Will Smith is always charismatic on the screen, but this time he wisely lets Jaden have that dramatic space and Will plays Chris Gardner, a real man under real pressure.  Chris is a brilliant man who didn't have the opportunities to develop his intellectual talents as he should have had.  He and his hard working wife made a tough business decision in trying to sell bone density scanners, but it was a product wasn't as accepted in the marketplace as they had hoped.  Now Linda (played with the right notes by Thandie Newton) has to work two shifts while their money gets spread thinner and thinner - to the point of evaporation.  A nice touch is when Linda pours the left over iced tea in their dinner glasses back into the pitcher.  Only people really hurting do that kind of thing.

However, despite the hardship, this is a positive and heartwarming movie.  We root for everyone in the film.  We realize that a lot of the pain in the film is caused by mis-communication or a total lack of willingness or ability to simply go and explain the situation to another.  Maybe that was impossible and things would not have worked out as well if they had.  Still, we wish people would just say this or that to that person there.

Ignore the one and two-star ratings which claim this film is ""depressing."" Foremost, the film is uplifting ... it is (forgive the cliche) a film which clearly illustrates the ""triumph of the human spirit."" It would have been a gross-misstep to ""downplay"" Gardner's challenges and hardships: this is what makes the ending as powerful as it is. Moreover, this film underscores that which is all-too-overlooked in our society: the unconditional love of a father for his child. Hollywood loves mothers, but often vilifies fathers ... it is refreshing to see a turn in the trend. And, that Will Smith's own son plays his on-screen son ... it is a tribute to fathers and sons everywhere.

The quality of the film itself is worthy of a four or five-star rating. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting (watch for a cameo by the real Chris Gardner at the film's conclusion), and the film-extras: all are near immaculate. Hopefully, this will help allay the fears that the one and two-star ratings may have instilled. And, also allow me to say, that I am not a fan of mainstream film ... but I did enjoy this honest portrait of an incredible man.

When you purchase this film, be certain to watch the film-extra ""The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner."" Though the feature-film is entirely self-contained (you do not need this documentary-short to explain any aspect of the film), it is a treat to see the real-life Chris Gardner and glean some insight into this man's commitment to attaining the ""American Dream"" for his son (which was still possible in '81).

For a bit of fun, also check-out the extra ""Inside the Rubik's Cube."" You will be stunned to see what a cult-phenomenon this ""toy"" remains even today!!

Watch this film if you have an interest in ""triumph over adversity,"" 1980's culture, or the oft-maligned, very-necessary role of fathers in our life.

He was a central figure afterall.  I didn't read the book, and maybe this has been addressed by someone in the other review postings, but I find it odd that the real son was left out of the ending.  This movie would not have been made if it did not have the son figure.  Did he not want to participate and why?  I fear that maybe he and his dad had a falling out.  That would be incredibly tragic and put a damper on the story.

As for the movie, my lower than average rating is because I found the movie to be sooo depressing.  A good drama builds to a climax where the action requires a ""drop-dead"" event, decision or encounter, then a resolution.  Here, 90 percent of the movie was at a climax stage.  It was one horror after another.  Okay, maybe that was the real life, but I needed a break-a few actually.

People are flawed (I know I am, because I haven't found a man who will commit to me yet) and Chris Gardner or whatever his name is is not an exception.  He was honest about it in his book, but the movie makes him out to be this absolutely perfect angel.  What a crock.

But all that said, to live a comfortable life we all have to earn money.  It makes the world go 'round and we all need it.  Period, end of story.  Chris made a lot of it and that doesn't guarantee him a happy life but it sure makes the journey smoother.

As someone who has experienced real adversity, I found the worship of money and the platitudes in the film completely sickening. What about all the countless people who have had to use shelters and food banks who don't have an opportunity to be an intern for a stock brokerage firm? Are their lives useless? People get comfort from their religion or friends, not from a bunch of yuppies who work in a job that makes money from money.

Will Smith and his son Jaden are amazing as the father-son team, but that's not where the story ends.  The minister for a homeless shelter is playing himself.  And the man whose life story is being told has a walk on role, too.

Smith's character is doing poorly selling an overpriced med-tech bone density scanner to physicians. He applies for an internship to become a stockbroker at Dean Witter, but there is no pay. He can't pay his bills, and his wife leaves him. He is evicted from two different rental units, spends a night in jail, and nights in homeless shelters and subways (always in the company of his son). Everything bad that can possibly happen to him does happen. It happens so much that I was uncomfortable watching much of it. I think what is missing from the film is any in-depth relationships that Chris Gardner has with anyone besides his son. They seem to be alone in an indifferent world. He doesn't seem to have anyone he can turn to for help and support. There is closure at the end, but it's questionable whether it is enough to balance out the titanic struggles Chris goes through to find his ""happyness"" (and yes, the misspelling IS explained in the movie).",1175990400,5,1092,4.783068783068783

It was a powerfull story of struggle.  I enjoyed this movie from the begining to the end.  It helps remind you that not every wealthy person had it easy or just given to them.  It reminds to you to focus on what YOU want and to go after it no matter what roadblocks may be thrown in front of you!

All of these ""extras"" are almost essential to the context ofthe film, and I tell friends who have seen the theatrical version to rent the DVD simply for the wonderful bonus features, which are at least an hour of fascinating material.

2745719,4,B000MRA59M,"I was really mad last winter, when the Pursuit of Happyness was released in theaters and my busy schedule kept me from taking a trip to the cinema to see it. Well one day in browsing Blockbuster I realized it had come out on DVD, so I take it home with me.

It was a 2-day rental. I still haven't given it back.

Inspired by a true story, Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner, the poor salesman who has a problem with parking tickets and paying rent. He's a very smart guy, though, as he is able to complete a Rubik's Cube in only a few minutes...talk about skilled! He has a son, Christopher, who he had with his girlfriend who leaves him towards the beginning of the movie. Chris applies for an internship as a stock broker in hope that he will be able to produce the money to provide a better living atmosphere for he and his son.

Will Smith has never given a finer performance. As a Hollywood multi-million dollar actor, the way he is able to portray a poor man in such a realistic way is beyond me. Little Jaden Smith (Will's son) does a surprisingly amazing job as Chris's son.

But, in my opinion, the best part about this movie is the message: ""If you want something, go get it. Period."" I couldn't agree with this statement more, and the true story of Chris Gardner proves it. Also, as American citizens, the Declaration of Independence says that we are entitled to the priveleges of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The PURSUIT of happiness...it's like happiness is something we can never gain...only pursue. :)

Highly recommended. Two hours well-spent in front of my TV.",1175990400,,1592,4.475862068965517

The movie is based on a true story of a man who was dealt more than his share of bad luck, grief,burdens and poverty.

Nothing just seems to go his way at all. His wife gets tired of the daily struggle to make ends meet, and she leaves him alone to raise his Son on a meager salary, and times just keep getting tougher for him.

They continue to move down in the world instead of up, and finally, they are homeless, and have to stand in a line every night to get a bed in a homeless shelter. It is so very sad, and you really feel for these characters!

Things begin to change however, when he sees what stockbroker's make, and gets into a competetive internship, where out of 20 people, only one will make it. While he is studying for this, He not only has the pressure of work, but has raising his Son to deal with.

Of course all his ambition pays off, and it is a joy to see things turn around for him-FINALLY!!!

2745744,2,B000MRA59M,"I expected a fair amount from this movie, and maybe that's why I felt left down. But I don't really think so. I believe the movie was mediocre at best. To me, the objective of a film is not just about telling sad or funny or any other kind of stories, but more importantly, to create a cinematic experience which the viewer can immerse him / herself in, and come out of feeling altered in some small way at least. This movie completely fails to do that.

There are a countless sad stories in the world to be told - tales of debilitating poverty, of fatal sicknesses, of sexual abuse, of mass genocide, war tyrannies - the list goes on. But in a film, what matters as much as the story is how the story is told. Movies like ""Life is Beautiful"" created magic when they told of suffering. ""Dancer in the Dark"" rips the soul out of your body. The Pursuit of Happyness - does nothing. I could barely feel for Chris Gardner (the protagonist), as he went through his motions. The effect on his young son, which I am sure must have been immense, was completely absent. His relationship with his wife is terrible from the start, but somehow lacks the tension it should cause, and becomes all the more forgettable as she walks out of the movie effortlessly. Everything, while looking superficially bad, just feels acceptable because you know it's going to be alright very soon.

To be fair to the movie, the movie does have a few genuine ""tear drop"" moments, but those are far and few in between. I think the acting, dialogue, cinematography - everything was just plain mediocre. But above all, I think it was the direction which let the movie down. I believe this movie could have been much better done in the hands of a more able person. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch this. If you're just flipping through channels one day and really have little better to do, then go for it. Otherwise, invest your time in something else.",1175904000,5,1936,4.466101694915254
2745745,3,B000MRA59M,"If you didn't read the book then, this is an excellent film, however, for those of us that read the book this movie is a big disappoinment. I know that a film based on a book has to be truncated to fit the average 2-3 hour movie time span but, the way that they told the story in this film is ridiculous. I won't give away the story but, the movie skipped a lot of important things in Mr. Gardeners life that explains where this man got his resiliency, determination, love, and will power. The movie also changed the story a bit too much, for instance, the way that the movie portrayed the split between Mr. Gardener and the mother of his child was way off the mark. I think that the movie should have ""stuck to the book"" and the director should have considered to at least introduce some of Mr. Gardeners experiences and influences throughout his young life (like director Spike Lee did with Malcolm X - which was an excellent book to movie film). Once again, Hollywood manages to destroy what could have been a monumental film.

As for the cast I think that Thadie Newton did an excellent job as the mother of Mr. Gardeners son. I'm not a big Will Smith fan (because I think his popularity exceeds his talent) but he did a good job of potraying the feeling and emotion in Mr. Gardeners life, not once during the film did I think , ""hey thats Will Smith"", So I have to give him credit.

Final words: If you didn't read the book and you want to see a film that is inspiring, then by all means get this movie, However, if you did read the book then you should not even waste your time.",1175817600,5,1584,4.259136212624584

It's sometimes uneasy to see how Chris Gardner made ends meet in the movie and he did it all for his son. The good work of charity organizations, the people who responded to his phone calls and bought his scanners helped. (I begin to think of all those promotion phone calls I turned down.) Chris's sheer determination, perseverance and guts to  survive his 6-month internship were again not an easy act to follow. It took every bit of his intelligence to pull it off.

2745749,5,B000MRA59M,"The chemistry between Will Smith and his real son who stars in this makes this movie very special.  I don't think another child actor could have pulled it off as well.  Most of the movie is factual, but the age of the child was 2 and not 5 as in the movie.  Also I find it hard to believe that he would have twice lost the scanning machines he was trying to sell and then able to recover them both times (or was it 3 times)?  Several reviewers complained that the movie did not show much of the happy part of his life, but it wasn't necessary because you know that once he lands the job at Dean Whitter that he will be just fine, especially knowing the sacrifices that he went through to get it.  Some say this is Will Smith's best performance yet and it may well be.  He was very convincing in the role and nothing was over done or under done.  His kid was cute without being precocious or too smart.  The relationship between father and son couldn't have been done any better.  This is not a movie about overcoming racism, but in Chris Gardner's own words, it's about overcoming ""Placeism"".  By that he means being born in a poor family without influence or advantage and no money of his own and having to overcome those disadvantages.  The real Chris Gardner is a great role model for those who think they can't make it in this world because of who they are, the color of their skin, what they do or don't start with or where they come from.  One of the best lines in the movie is when Chris (Smith) tells his son: ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something--not even me"".  The bonus features are nice, especially learning about the Italian director who could barely speak English and getting to see and hear the real Chris Gardner.  The movie is a little long and even though you know that he gets the job in the end, it is still an emotional scene and one of the best in the movie when he finally gets told.",1175644800,,1929,4.249315068493151

Very few people could actually survive living life on the streets of America and Chris Gardner is one of them. PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS shows how the homeless community in America isn't always drunks and loonies. The film captures the downward spiral and the desperation that Gardner experienced.

2745767,3,B000MRA59M,"I think it's safe to assume that by now most people, whether they've seen ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" or not, are aware of the ""rags to riches"" theme that is the basis of the story.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers have taken a great true-life story and turned it into a long, drawn out study in futility. The script was in dire need of tightening; three-fourths of the film did not have to be dedicated to Gardner's never ending battle with hardships and disappointments - and that machine! Viewers get the point at least halfway (if not sooner) through the movie.

The script should have concentrated more on how his time as an intern at the brokerage firm helped lay the foundation for his future success - with the last act being more concerned with his growing financial success after he ventured out on his own; that's a great story that is never told - at least in the film. Instead, Gardner elaborates on that subject in the ""Special Features"" segment.

As for Will Smith's performance, I can see why he was up for an Oscar. The fact that he didn't win in no way took anything away from a truly outstanding (and Oscar calibre) performance, matched only by his son's wonderful performance as well.

Perhaps just as important as the message in the film is the discovery of Will Smith as a fine, leading actor in a dramatic role. That said, I hope ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" will be the vehicle that allows him to continue on in that direction. I have no doubt that in time he will get that Oscar he deserves.",1175212800,3,1511,4.523809523809524

2745789,2,B000MRA59M,"Will Smith is the main reason I went to see this film.  He stars as Chris Gardner.  Back in 1981, his life was hard.  His girlfriend/wife (I've heard both, and the movie never makes it clear) is working double shifts to support the two of them and their son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  Chris, meanwhile, is working as hard has he can to sell bone density machines.  He's already bought them, so he needs to sell them to get his life savings back.

One day, he happens to meet a successful stock broker.  Chris is fascinated by the wealth this guy has, so he begins to pursue it as a new career, not knowing all the stress that is involved.  He learns of an internship offered by Dean Witter, and tries to get into the program despite his lack of formal education.

Meanwhile, his life is going downhill.  His landlord is tired of waiting for the rent and his wife decides to leave for New York.  Can he balance being a single dad with a spot in this competitive internship?

The first strike against the movie is the trailer.  That's right.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen this movie.  I half expected that when I went to see it, so that's not my main complaint.

I went to the film expecting an inspiring true story.  I got a true story.  While the theme ""If you work hard, you can accomplish anything"" does come out, the movie focuses on all the struggles.  It got depressing long before the end with very little to balance it out.

And, of course, there are Chris's actions.  While I did spend most of the film rooting for him to succeed, there were times it was hard.  He risked too much since he had to care for his son.  And he didn't seem to be able to keep track of his machines either.

What I can't fault is Will Smith's performance.  He is a powerful actor who does an excellent job bringing Chris to life.  Jaden Smith does a decent job playing the son, he good but certainly not the next big child star.  Their bond was touching and provided some of the lighter moments.

Capitalism however is a term created by Karl Marx, who ridiculously believed that the benefits of free-enterprise only go towards the rich.

  Some idiots have already rung in with ridiculous assessments, such as one who claims that according to this movie, money is happiness, but if that's the case, then why didn't Chris Gardner abandon his son, since according to the reviewer, he would have been happier that way.  Happiness is a subjective thing.  Part of the reason Chris Gardner pursued the job of a stock-broker is so that he could create a better life for his son.  By far the most idiotic claim comes from toddo however who says:

""The American dream in this movie is one of the false values this society actively promotes. Don't fall for it!""

Does toddo believe that the pursuit of misery, suffering, death, and destruction, are the real,  true values that are society should pursue instead.  Did you, toddo, cry not out of happiness but sadness when the Berlin Wall fell or when you heard that Pol Pot had been slain.  Let us all return to the Dark Ages while we're at it.  Or does toddo believe that otherss subjective happiness is not his subjective happiness and therefore that they must be wrong.

  The movie itself is heart-warming and slightly funny at times.  Chris Gardner is a  member of the proletariat, working hard to pull himself up out of poverty.  He is hardly some greedy, shallow, materialistic, monster, but rather a hard-working man who uses his head, pays attention to and acts on opportunities, and even makes a big risk at one point, which at first flops but creates something useful when he follows up on it.  It also portrays a big successful businessman whom he meets as an extraordinarily friendly businessman and kindly father himself.

2745792,5,B000MRA59M,"I do not normally review DVD's but 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' got my attention. This is of course the true story of Chris Gardner,an entrepeneuring San Franciscan played by Will Smith who peddles heavy Bone Density machines to support his girlfriend and young son (played by Will's own son Jaden).One thing leads to another,his girlfriend leaves Chris,one things leads to another and Chris and his little boy end up living in a church mission for a time;it's a bones to rags to riches story in and of itself. But many things impressed me about it. Will Smith really threw himself believably into his character and little Jaden is actually a pretty fine actor;very very believable. And if this is autobiographically correct I think Chris Gardner was a good parent for one reason if nothing else;he didn't lie to his son. Instead of making promises he couldn't keep,he did his best to keep the boy safe and calm and always told him the truth as he could understand it,even if it wasn't what the boy wanted to hear. The juxtaposition of actuall homeless people with actors was a great idea as Jaden's sometimes confused and frightened interactions all the more real;no child should have to go through what he does in this movie. But Chris maintains his dignity extremely well even at the lowest ebb of riding the subway all night,because there was nowhere else to be. Even studying as a non salery intern at Dean Witter Chris is a very intelligent man;he encourages and respects his son's thirst for knowledge,has an idedic memory for numbers and can solve rubix cubes in a few minutes. But where he seems to fail is common sense. Most of the things he went through wouldn't have occured had he not been so obsessed with people who ran off with his Bone Density machines;these escapades lead him to almost get killed by a car. But he's doing it all for his child.'The Pursuit Of Happiness' is kind of an oxymoron because this is more about the pursuit. There isn't a lot of happy moments in this movie no. Some light humor. Another good thing is Will Smith produced this himself and totally avoided the mawkish melodrama movies about this subject have tended to have in the best-he concentrates on humanity and genuine love. It's a true story and nothing is over the top;it did and could all really happen. But even at it's saddest moments 'Pursuit Of Happiness' is very positive. Of course it has a happy ending but that isn't the point-the journey is what's important. It doesn't glamorize homelessness-it glamorizes love and fatherhood and if you have to glamorize something aren't those worthwhile?This is a great movie to see-it's smells of MAJOR oscers and I hope it receives them.",1175126400,3,2684,4.761802575107296

It is based on a true story which adds to its beauty, not to mention that the chemistry between Will Smith and his son Jaden is just real life.

I was impressed with how devoted this man was in everything he was doing. What a nightmare trying to sell these scanners! Yet, that was what he was stuck with and he was trying to do the best out of it.

A movie with a lot of positive messages about life relationships which can help someone see the difficulties he goes through under a different prospective. Of course it brings up the phenomenon of homeless people in the richest country of the world.

2745797,4,B000MRA59M,"PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a film that despite all its flaws (repetition of chases, repeated encounters that mirror the last, emotional overload, excessive playing time of two hours, etc) reinforces some truly important human values: love between a father and son, pushing forward toward success despite all the roadblocks, kindness for the plight of the homeless, and strength of character in the face of hopelessness.  Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.

Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt.  Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film.  Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco.  Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.

With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry.  The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed.  How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.

Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines.  Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy.  The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent.  PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is well worth the journey.  Grady Harp, March 07",1175040000,3,2580,4.732142857142857

The trouble is, there's only a miniscule chance of that -- Gardner is competing with dozens of other hopefuls, among whom only one will be selected to stay with the firm.

To compound matters, Gardner's wife has just left him, sick of the couple's financial woes. He has custody of their young son Christopher, which brings him comfort -- and panic, when he is evicted from his apartment and ends up homeless. Gardner quickly learns that there aren't many resources for homeless fathers in 1980s California -- there are shelters for men, and shelters for women and children. No one seems to care about single fathers.

Nonetheless, Gardner does his best to hold onto Christopher, convinced that their luck will turn as soon as he's able to complete his internship and land the job. He's also determined not to let anyone know his circumstances, studying in the shelter by the light from outside, and taking care to appear in fresh, clean suits every day.

In the light of many movies today -- violent, stupid-funny, or a just plain waste of $10 and 90 minutes -- ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was a wonderful treat! Smith is a talented actor, portraying the true story of a man facing horrific odds who refused to give up. We can all use a little inspiration like that.",1174780800,6,1403,4.695121951219512

I am not about to tell the story here again.  You can see other reviews for this.  Anyway, the Smith & Son had an excellent performance.  Can't remember whether Will Smith have done this kind of genre before.  I don't quite like Thandie Newton's acting as the wife (& mother) - a bit over-acting.  Not sure about the real life story - her charater in the movie is selfish, unreasonable and humiliating.  I think she could act a bit mellow being a loving mother of a young child.

The part that describes Will's struggling journey took it too long, so we could only see a brief 2 minutes of his ""Happiness"" at the end of the movie.  I can understand the Director's intention of building up the theme to the end, but I would do it differently if I am writing the script.

I don't understand why a mistakenly spelling word (mentioned several times in the movie) ""Happyness"" is used as the movie title.  It is bad education to the public.  After all, Is it Joy or Happiness that we are searching for in life?  May be it's getting a bit philosophical......",1174694400,2,1184,4.400921658986175

2745813,5,B000MRA59M,"I have always enjoyed Will Smith's movies (I missed ""Wild Wild West"" so I dodged the bullet on that), but I was astounded at how deeply moving this movie was. His portrayal of a man fighting against poverty, and burdened by having a family on top of that was eerily convincing. I have a good friend who is a successful author who went through much of the same. Living out of his car, showering daily at the gym, working every day and writing at coffeehouses every night, basically doing whatever it took to stay alive and create a better future, while doing everything he could to keep anyone from finding out that he was homeless. Now he has a line of successful books and helps out others who are in need.

To me this is more than a movie about someone overcoming adversity: this is a message of hope to anyone who is able to see this movie and realize that they are not alone, and not unable to change the future. I did some research and found the numbers of people living in their cars, vans, station wagons, and RV's in America is staggering. These people work next to us, go to movies, read books, pay taxes, and in every way are citizens, except for their ability to afford rent. Living in Los Angeles I know how expensive real estate is in California. Not every job pays enough to afford even a small apartment, but someone needs to make our espressos and  Big Macs or our way of living would cease. Knowing this makes this movie so much more poignant, so much more of a social commentary that it is not easy being poor, and even harder pulling yourself out of poverty when so many simply give in and accept it. But it gives hope to those who need it most. I applaud Will Smith for making a movie with this gravity in between his more action-oriented projects.",1174521600,6,1768,4.37082066869301

Inspirational movies touch your heart. They have something that tells about ourselves and things we can relate to. ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is the most inspirational film of 2006. Not only because we understand and care about the main characters, but also there is an important message which is to follow your dreams no matter what. The road might be difficult--maybe to the point of despair--but if you finish the journey, your life will change forever.

Story:

The movie starts in San Francisco in early 1980s. Family man Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is going through difficult financial problems. He is an unsuccessful salesman who struggles everyday trying to sell a medical machine--bigger than a microwave oven--that not many doctors want. He carries one everyday. Unfortunately, his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) doesn't make much money either. They have a five-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Smith) who Chris takes to a day care center everyday. Things go from bad to worse; the money they make is not enough to sustain them. Chris sees an opportunity, he wants to become a stock broker and gets an internship, but there is no pay until he is chosen. Linda cannot stand the poverty they live in and decides to leave him for good. Chris wants to stay with his son in San Francisco, she doesn't fight back. Now he has to take care of him and pursuit a dream to become a stock broker and leave the poverty they are in. ""Will"" he make it?

Review:

A compelling film, ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" follows the old dramatic underdog formula that most of us are used to by now, but it's done correctly this time around because you really care about the main character. In other words, Will's performance is what makes this movie great. We see Chris going through a lot of problems, not only economically but emotionally as well. Linda is sick and tired of dealing with all his issues--she is a mean and unlikable character to say the least--and poor little Christopher is always asking questions. These situations create moments of despair to Chris throughout the film. Although it seems for moments that the whole city is against him, Will Smith's character never gives up his hopes. He is smart, likable and persuasive--he is also excellent at the 80s famous Rubik's cube which gives the audience a feeling of how smart this guy is. He sends the right message to the audience of what he is about.

We appreciate the credibility and realism of this film due to great photography and costume design--the look and feel of the subway scenes are excellent. These elements give us the impression that we are back in the 80s. There are some moments where the movie drags a bit and it might feel soapy for some, but those small little flaws do not affect the final product.

The Verdict:

Probably an Oscar contender for best actor, ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a touchy film that gives us lessons of perseverance, love and the American dream. Great acting, inspiring story, and the survival factor make the film one of the best dramas of 2006. We recommend it.",1173657600,7,3070,4.779245283018868

As we watch Smith descending into the bowels of society, we are heartbroken along with him, and later elated when successes come.

The way the story is told is very realistic; Charles Gardner deals with the same problems that so many of us have gone through. I have enjoyed seeing Will Smith's previous films, but this one made the biggest impression on me. Perhaps it is because of the fact that the boy in the film (Christopher) is actually his own son (Jaden), so their acting together is all the more effective. Whatever the reason, however, Smith's performance here is stronger than that seen in I, Robot, Independence Day, Hitch, or Men in Black, and greatly deserves a notable award for his effort. I especially liked the scene where Chris must take shelter in the men's room with his son at the subway station. It is moving, to say the least. At the end of the movie, we are told that the real Chris Gardner is now a respected millionaire. Perhaps it's a result of the enduring love for his child that motivated him to become who he is today?

2745861,4,B000MRA59M,"The Pursuit of Happiness is the true life story of Chris Gardner, who was a struggling salesman of medical scanners in the 1980s. His life hit the doldrums when his wife left him, and he has to take care of his young son. Soon he is evicted from his house and has to sleep with his son in a public bathroom (and later on homeless shelters). A small light at the end of the tunnel appears when he is accepted as an unpaid intern at a stock brokerage firm - he is one of 20 such interns, and only one will be chosen after six months to join the company in a lucrative job. Meanwhile, he has to make ends meet with his young son as he best can, facing debts, evictions, bills, etc. Some people criticize the movie as being too pro capitalist. There is some truth to that, as the rich guys who head the stock brokerage firm are shown to be all nice men, while the poor (with the exception of Chris) are bitter, resentful, unhappy with their lives. Yet, the movie also shows realistically what is to be a poor man in America as very few Hollywood movies do. All in all, a very good movie.",1170892800,2,1083,4.161904761904762

2745863,4,B000MRA59M,"PROSITIVES:  This heartwarming film, based on true life, once again exalts the American Dream that anything is possible with a little luck and a lot of hard work.  All African Americans should watch this film.  Here is the depiction of an African American hero who refuses to give up, even when the odds are hopelessly against him.  All those who are facing major life setbacks should also watch this film.  This film offers more than entertainment.  This film offers encouragement to carry on.  All those who struggle with family relationships should see this film.  This film shows a love between a father and son that weathers the storms of life.  This film encourages family members to hold on a little longer.  Anyone not yet mentioned should see this film.  This film is one of those rare works of art that has the potential to improve society.  Will Smith does an excellent job in his role as Chris Gardner.

NEGATIVES:  I only gave this film four stars because it begins to get a little slow about 2/3 of the way through and the conclusion is predictable.  The film's media publicity probably brought a few more people to the film, but gave away too much of the plot.",1170460800,2,1175,4.635922330097087
2745864,5,B000MRA59M,"It could be said that this is a movie about a number of things: The pursuit of the American dream, never giving up, and that if you are prepared to do whatever it takes, you can probably achieve anything. I think it also hints at the question of whether money, success and power can ever bring happiness in themselves but, wisely, it's a question the movie leaves largely unanswered.

For me though, this movie is about a man who has an absolute and unwavering love for, and commitment to, his young son. As a man who didn't have a good relationship with his father in the past and doesn't have one at all in the present, I found the movie painfully difficult, yet exhilaratingly beautiful to watch. If more black men (or maybe even men in general) were this committed to their sons, I remember thinking, this world would be a very different place.

The movie is based on the real-life story of the real-life Chris Gardner, a bright and talented San Francisco man who falls on bad times, suffers the breakdown of his relationship with his wife and eventually winds up homeless. Thandie Newton gives a strong performance as the waspish shrew of a wife who eventually naffs off and leaves Chris to it. (Well, to be fair to her, she did want to take the child with her but Chris put his foot down). Through all the struggles that follow, Chris always has his son at his side and this is the heart of the story.

Though this is probably my favourite Will Smith performance since 1998's ""Enemy Of The State"" (and a performance that has earned Mr Smith a Best Actor Oscar nomination), for me it's his son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, who is the real star of this movie. For a first-timer, he gives a barnstorming, heartwrenching perfomance. And he's such a cutie too. I've become a hardened, jaded, unfeeling and cynical old man over the years and hardly anything touches me anymore but this movie, I felt. This one made me cry. I cried the first time I watched it and I cried even more when I watched it a second time. I can't wait for the DVD. I don't know what it is, but this movie has something special. If you haven't seen it already, I urge you to do so. Inspirational on so many levels. The real Chris Gardner makes a brief cameo appearance towards the end of the movie which just wraps it up beautifully.

How come no soundtrack though? Apart from the score by Andrea Guerra, which granted is very good, the movie had some great music by George Benson, Stevie Wonder, Roberta Flack, Seal and The Glide Ensemble among others. I really hope they release one.",1170460800,6,2561,4.489270386266094
2745865,3,B000MRA59M,"""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is a based-on-truth story about Chris Gardner, freelance salesman of portable bone density tracer. But carrying a heavy machine around in San Francisco is a hard work especially when he has to send his son to the daycare center, and not every doctor is interested in his `gismo.' Down on his luck, he accepts an unpaid job in the training program of a stockbroking house, but in spite of (or because of) his eagerness, his wife become more estranged, giving a cold shoulder to him.

Will Smith is perfect as Chris Gardner, who eventually has to sleep in a public restroom in the subway with his son, making him believe that this is a `cave.' Because of the warmth and humor in Will Smith's performance and the visible rapport with his son (played by his real-life son Jaden), the film is not depressing as you might believe. Still some people (not me) might feel so looking at Chris doing jobs as unpaid intern, hit by a car in the street, and still going back to work even though he is uncertain of his future (only one applicant will pass the test).

Italian-born director Gabriele Muccino avoids sugary sentiments in this Horatio Alger-like tale, and at times Chris' zealous attitudes look pathetic (don't miss one scene where Chris is seen dragging his son to catch a bus). It is clear that Muccino is trying to present his own version of American dream. The film gets really credible and its satire becomes biting when the company's bosses casually ask him to do things like lending five dollars. The bosses are not bad people (no `villains' appear), but they just don't see the vast gaps (financial and otherwise) between them and Chris even though they are both wearing suits.

However, like many major studio films made by non-American directors brought in Hollywood, we can see director is trying to be different in contents, but we don't see in what way exactly. I read many reviews on this film, and though many used such words as inspirational and uplifting, some people said the film is depressing. The fact is `The Pursuit of Happyness' could be both, not content with being either of them. After all, what made Chris apply for the stockbroker's trainee course first? Was it a red Ferrari or his son's happiness?

We are not sure of that. We are sure of Will Smith's heart-warming turn, however, and that is probably the greatest thing in `The Pursuit of Happyness' which is a feel-good movie, but there is somewhere in the film an untold part you can vaguely sense.",1170115200,,2507,4.6909090909090905
2745866,5,B000MRA59M,"Will Smith, as Chris Gardner, and Jaden Smith, as his son Christopher, give outstanding performances in this inspiring movie based on the true story of a man who kept getting up when life knocked him down and overcame adversity to find success and, more important, ""happyness.""

  Gardner never loses his bearing. He never complains. Never makes excuses. He never blames other people, his hard circumstances or bad luck. The words ""if only"" never once come out of his mouth. He holds on to his vision. He keeps his priorities -- his son and being a good parent -- straight. He cannot control the big outcome that he wants, but he can control how he reacts to what's happening right now, and that's the key to fulfilling his vision. Because he makes good small choices more often than not, he ultimately finds what he's looking for. He has stamina, persistance and stubbornness. There are no guarantees any of it will get him what he wants, but he chooses to keep trying.

  Gardner doesn't always make perfect choices (bone density scanners?) but he also doesn't add to his burdens by making rotten choices such as escapism, sitting in a depressed heap watching TV for hours every night, chain smoking, drowning his miseries each evening at the local bar or developing a drug habit.

  The key moment is when Gardner goes out of his way to apologize for being late for a meeting. Though he still faces struggles, this is the turning point. It's this action that sets him apart -- not this specific action, but the fact that he does this kind of thing when few others would. His choice to make the apology results in an accumulation of opened doors that helps him save himself.

  All of this rings true to real life which -- given that it's based on the true story of a man who had it even harder than the movie version -- is because it is real life.

  Strengths of the movie include that it shows how thin the line is between shelter, food, warmth and comfort for so many people and homelessness and serious challenges without getting preachy, whiny or political. It shows how slight the safety net is. And its strengths include the high value the movie places on being a responsible parent.

  Gardner is out for financial success, there's no doubt about that -- but the movie never suggests that this goal is any more important to him than being a good father and having a loving relationship with his child. The relationship between father and son is beautifully portrayed by the Smiths.

  Another of the movie's strengths is that nothing is overplayed. When Gardner finds some success, he almost cries -- but he doesn't actually cry. The moment is played just right.

  This movie is about how one man confronts the actual hard challenge of life and how the choices he makes help him succeed. Yes, it is a story that has been told many times before. But -- given all the negativity, pessimism and naysayers readily available to us all on a daily basis -- it's a story that cannot be overtold. It is the American story, and we need to keep hearing it.

  Here was my favorite thing about this movie: The theater was packed and in the latter stages of the movie I snapped out of the trance Will and Jaden Smith had me in for long enough to notice that some of the people around me were clapping, cheering and crying. I haven't seen a movie in a long time that got the audience that involved.

  Will Smith deserves all the awards he gets for this one.",1169942400,2,3456,4.5453074433656955
2745867,5,B000MRA59M,"Every time Will Smith ran in this film, I'd hear a part of me cheer him. I doubt he can act any better. Let's save ourselves sometime and give him at least an Oscar Nomination for this film called Pursuit of Happyness. Now, you may wonder what is about this film that's worth liking. Mere words (or my words) can't explain but I'll try.

Chris Gardener(Will Smith) is a man who's wife has left him. He has no income and lives on selling some machine. He has one son who's five years old. He runs around to find a job vacancy or to sell his machine. Sometimes he runs from the taxi driver while at other time he runs behinds hippies and crazy folks. There is much more but I'll let that be.

Queer intrigue attaches itself it's self to Will Smith in this film. Everything about him makes you want to cheer him on. I relate to Will Smith. His fears, troubles, tears, smiles, gestures and shoes become yours by the end of the first hour.

Don't miss this film. I'm not gonna call it life affirming. All I can say about this movie is Will Smith, Will Smith and Will Smith.

2745888,4,B000MRA59M,"Life isn't easy.  Life is incredibly difficult.  It's full of challenges and obstacles.  On each one of our individual journeys there are thousands of things that can happen to knock us off our feet and set us back hundreds of paces.  It can be really frustrating and confusing.  Yet, the trials of life shouldn't be an excuse for giving up.  We can move forward towards ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""  That's what Chris Gardner did.

THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is an inspiring movie about some of the events in Gardner's life and how he was able to overcome them.  Gardner (played by Will Smith) was a struggling salesman of portable bone density scanners.  He used his life savings to pay for the venture and it was a costly mistake, but Gardner didn't give up.  He was determined to work the pavement, going from one medical office to another until he sold every last unit and could move on to better things.  His wife is unhappy in their marriage, his car has been possessed by the City of San Francisco, and they are almost three months behind due on their rent.  In this desperate time Gardner becomes inspired to apply for an internship at a major stock brokerage firm.  He impresses the employers and is offered the competitive internship, only to discover that it's a six month unpaid internship.  Determined to change things around, Gardner takes the position.  His wife leaves and Gardner is left to raise their son alone.  Together the father and son struggle as they are evicted from one place and another, homelessness, an auto accident, tax seizure, and mediocre child care all in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Will Smith is one of America's great actors.  He can do drama, action, comedy, romance, and just about any other genre and not just do it, but do it well.  In this film he is joined by his own son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, portraying Gardner's son, Christopher.  Will Smith and Jaden must have a strong relationship and it comes across in the movie.  The real-life relationship between the film's stars helps ground the movie even more.

I enjoyed watching THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS.  The movie seemed real and true. Unlike many inspirational stories and biopics I've seen, it wasn't an over-sentimental, mushy, feel-good fluffy film.  Instead, to me, I felt like I was watching a few chapters from the biography of someone's life; a person who had overcome some incredible odds.  I also enjoyed the strong relationship displayed between Gardner and Christopher.  So often in movies, even ones based on real people, children neglect their parents and parents neglect their children.  That wasn't the case in this film.  It's nice for a change to watch a movie that shows a deep and strong relationship between a father and his son.  Now, that's inspirational.",1169251200,2,2819,4.824634655532359

Unfortunately, money does buy some happiness.  As Chris looks about the wealthy, he observes, ""They looked so d---ed happy to me.  Why couldn't I look like that?""  His lot is to sell portable magnetic resonance imaging machines to doctors.  His prospects can be inferred by his description of them as ""expensive...and only slightly better at creating images"" than the ones they already had.  His wife, Linda (Chandie Newton) picks up the slack.  They have a beautiful, intelligent, inquisitive son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), whom they juggle from daycare to parent care, like many struggling wage earners.  She bears the burden as the chief wage earner, taking double shifts at the laundry, which can hardly be lucrative.  Her patience with him and the paper chase runs her ragged.  The IRS, the landlord, and the utilities all have a constant claim to their near future.  In the meantime, Chris gets an offer for the American Dream, a chance to be an intern at Dean Whitter, where, once accepted, bares a twenty-to-one chance of being hired after six months of grueling stock huckstering and hitting the books.  Like most people he wants a better life for himself and his family.  Remembering his own lot in life, he vows, ""My children were gonna know who their father is.""  Indeed some of the father and son scenes show real love, even by a father who is frayed by the pressures to succeed.  Taking place in the eighties, Chris will try the impossible, aligning his fortunes like the Rubik's cube he sets out to master...

`The Pursuit of Happyness' pays dirt.  Every development along the way is absorbing from the first frame.  Always a stickler to detail, the beautiful background music and the well-chosen soundtrack are marvelous without ever making the film sentimental.  It's one step forward and two steps back.  This is true for Chris and the rest of us. Only the way it is revealed by Chris is truly a piece of work.  Chris tells his son, ""Don't ever let anyone tell you, you can't do something...If you have a dream, you have to protect it...You want something, go get it.""

2745893,4,B000MRA59M,"The average critical reaction to this movie seems to be that it's ""Hollywood Fluff"" full of ""self-help platitudes"" and ""unrealistic, emotionally manipulative treacle"".

  The funny thing is, this movie is based quite closely on a true story, and anyone that wants to let out the routine criticisms should check out the real story.

  This movie wasn't fluffed up to make the character's plight worse than it was- if anything, it was toned down. In the movie, Gardner's wife is portrayed as a fundamentally good, hardworking woman who leaves because she just can't put up with him anymore, and Gardner has to fight tooth and nail for his son.

  In real life, she just ran off with their son -only to show up at his homeless shelter months later to tell him that she couldn't deal with him, and he was just going to have to take care of him himself. Not the type of woman audiences would be sorry to see go.

  Also left out are the details of his childhood, the physical abuse Garder took from his stepfather as a child, and the time he was raped by an older man.

  To me, this movie isn't about an ordinary man getting rich, with the message ""anyone can do this"". To me, this is the story of an extraordinary man. I don't like it because the Will Smith's character could be anybody or an ""everyman"", but because his determination is something to look up to and aspire to.

  I saw a pre-fame video from 2000 of the real Chris Gardner, and while he's a lot balder, chubbier and grouchier than the Will Smith version, he was clearly a very bright and interesting guy. Without nearly as many Hollywood flourishments as so many assume, this is his story, and it deserves some repect.

  This is a good, solid movie. It's Will Smith best performance to date. It reminds me of Tom Cruise in ""Jerry Maguire"" (in his pre-couch days!), and  the chemistry with his son is nice.

2745897,5,B000MRA59M,"This is the best survival story I've ever seen and is certainly some of Will Smith's best work.

This true story made into a movie is about how real life Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith); a street pounding medical equipment salesman, faces seemingly insurmountable odds and comes out a winner.

Gardner invests the family nest egg in very high tech bone density scanners and plans to set the world on fire with his salesmanship skills to catapult his brood into wealth and prosperity. But the world does not beat a path to his door to buy his new gizmos and the Gardner family falls onto financial hard times. His wife Linda (Thandie Newton) grows weary of working double shifts while her ever optimistic husband returns home each day lugging the same two scanners under his arms unsold.

Finally, Linda flees the marriage to New York, leaving her 9-year old son Chris, Jr. (Jaden Smith) and her shell-shocked husband to fend for themselves.

In a bid to change his fortunes, Gardner applies for an internship at Dean Whitter as a stock broker. Unfortunately, the six month program has no salary and Gardner is faced with having to work for free, care for his son, and make ends meet as a single parent all at the same time.

If that weren't bad enough, things quickly go downhill from there. Gardner and his son are evicted from their apartment because they can't pay the rent, and poor dad is subsequently arrested for not paying parking tickets (for a car he no longer owns). Afterwards, the hapless pair are forced to fight for a room each day in a first-come first-served homeless shelter to keep a roof over their heads. One day when they arrive late, they're informed that the shelter had run out of space and they end up sleeping on the floor of a subway bathroom with toilet paper for a mattress.

The only means Gardner has to earn money is to keep selling the last of his bone density scanners, two of which he manages to get stolen. It's a fight for survival as he recovers his stolen property, repairs them, and sells them just in time to keep the wolves at bay. It's hard to believe that so much adversity can fall on one man, yet that's exactly what happened to the real Chris Gardner.

This movie is an inspiration to anyone who faces seemingly insurmountable odds and fights to survive. The real Chris Gardner not only beats out his competition in the internship program, but today he is a multimillionaire and owner of his own investment firm.

It's an American success story mixed with the gritty reality of human suffering, tenacity, and the struggle to survive.

His wife Linda played by Thandie Newton is becoming disillusioned working a double shift and still fighting to keep the wolf away from the door.

Will Smith did an excellent job capturing every heartfelt moment of his character. Its very rare that I cry watching movies, but the scenes that left me speechless and in tears were the bathroom scene, and the boardroom scene (near the end of the movie). Will deserves an oscar nom, if not the award for this movie, he was excellent.  The bathroom scene was so moving, especially the way he got his son to believe that they were hiding from dinosaurs.  It was by far the best acting scenes ever by any actor.  I know in a lot of movies when actors have to cry, you know its not real tears, but Will sure had me fooled. His emotions throughout the movie were so intense, I swear those many of his tears were real.  The courage the real life Chris Gardner had, to hold it all together despite his struggles to maintain some sense of self-respect, while trying to provide food and shelter for himself and his son. So many people complain about how bad their life is and some turn to drugs and violence as a means to survive, but this guy represents what it truly means to stand and deliver and that he did.  As Malcom X said ""A man who stands for nothing falls for anything"".  Chris Gardner stood for plenty and it paid off.

This kind of film has been made many, many times before, and frankly, it's getting tiresome.

So why am I giving it four stars? I suppose because, as worn out and cliched as this story is, it at least has some decent performances and a good message. And it delivers exactly as you expect it to: if you want a feel good film, you've got a feel good film. I'm sure those of you who aren't as jaded as I am will be reduced to tears by the plight of Gardner, played in the film by Will Smith. He overcomes a number of difficult circumstances, ones that many wouldn't be able to handle if they were in his place. Living in San Francisco in 1981, Gardner tried his hand at selling bulky bone density machines to hospitals, thinking that such a technology would be preferred over traditional x-rays. Unfortunately, most of the hospitals considered them to be unnecessary luxuries and weren't willing to invest.

As a result of slow business, Gardner and his family are in a financial crisis: their rent is months overdue; they owe the IRS; and they can't rely solely on the wife's income. How fortuitous that he should pass a man getting out of his Ferrari. ""What do you do and how do you do it?"" asks Gardner. ""I'm a stockbroker,"" replies the man, pointing to the building they're both standing next to. He also says that you don't necessarily have to go to college to be a stockbroker; you only need to be good with numbers and good with people. This inspires Gardner to apply for the internship program at Dean Witter. He's offered a position (aided by his ability to solve a Rubik's Cube). Despite the fact that he'll receive no salary, and despite the fact that he's down on his luck, he accepts the offer, believing that if he can work through the internship, something better will come along.

Unfortunately, it's too little too late in terms of his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton). Years of financial strain have pushed her to the breaking point, and she decides to leave for New York. Of course, she wants to take their five-year-old son, Chris, Jr. (played by Smith's real life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), but both she and Gardner know that she can't care for him. Thus, Chris is left with his father. This suits Gardner just fine; early on, his voiceover narration says that he didn't meet his real father until he was twenty-six, and that no matter what, he would make sure his children knew who their father was.

For most of the rest of the film, it seems as if everything will continue to go downhill. For one thing, he can no longer afford to pay his rent, meaning he has to leave his apartment. He and his son move into a local motel, where he pays half of what he paid for rent. But then the IRS finally catches up with him, taking over six hundred dollars out of his bank account. He's left with just over twenty dollars, which is not nearly enough to pay for their room. This paves the way for one of the film's more devastating scenes; with nowhere else to go for the night, they lock themselves in a subway bathroom. The impact of the scene is heightened by the fact that someone continuously rattles the door on the other end.

The effectiveness of this scene depended on its originality. I say this because the rest of the film is unflatteringly run of the mill. At one point, when shooting hoops with his son, Gardner says, ""Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You want something, you go for it, period."" It's a fine sentiment, certainly, but haven't we heard such sentiments before? And consider the character of Alan Frakesh (Dan Castellaneta), the Dean Witter employee who trains the new interns; while he never talks down to Gardner, he does ask him to do degrading menial tasks, such as getting him coffee, buying him donuts, and re-parking his car to avoid the street sweepers. I can't help but wonder if he was included merely as a counterpoint to Gardner's good spirit; are villains of these kind required in such films?

Nonetheless, I was moved by Gardner's tenacity, which is another reason why I went ahead and gave the film four stars. He clearly doesn't know the meaning of the word ""quit,"" which is one of the best attitudes to have in life. Even when forced to wait in long lines to stay in homeless shelters, he refuses to settle for what he has been dealt. He's determined to make a better life for himself and his son, which is difficult considering Chris, Jr. doesn't completely understand what his father is going through. He's merely a boy of five, with a basketball, a little multicolored backpack, and a Captain America figurine in his possession. There's no denying that the kid is as cute as a button, which is probably what enabled me to look past the heavy-handedness of his line, ""You're a good papa.""

I don't think there's any question of whether or not Gardner overcomes adversity; the real life Christopher Gardner is now a multimillionaire in his own firm. The fact that he succeeded clearly makes his story inspiring, and for that, I'm recommending ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" Still, I got the sense that this film adaptation altered the story to make it more appealing for a mass audience, which resulted in a number of tried and true elements that have long since worn out their welcome. It can't be a good thing when a five-minute segment on ""Oprah"" is more interesting than a two-hour film; Gardner told Oprah his childhood Christmas Day experience. While he was taking a bath, his abusive stepfather stormed in, held a gun at him, and told him to get out of the apartment. Naked and wet, Gardner was left outside on a freezing December night. That kind of material would have made more of an impact than the material in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" did. Unfortunately, I'm forced to settle for yet another feel good tearjerker.",1167177600,2,6420,4.611548556430447
2745911,5,B000MRA59M,"The Pursuit of Happyness is the sad but uplifting true story of millionairre stockbroker Chris Gardner. Will Smith (Hitch) plays Gardner with such a sincerity that I will be rooting for him to win this year's Oscar for Best Actor when, not if, he is nominated.

The movie pursues Gardner as he struggles with cash, which ends him up on the street with his son, played by Smith's real life son Jaden, who in my opinion deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as well. After being evicted from his home for failing to pay the rent, Gardner goes from the subway restroom to homeless shelters, as his dream of becoming a stockbroker takes it's first but difficult steps as a non-paid intern at a major stock brokerage firm.

Pursuit teaches us that we must follow our dreams no matter what might happen. It is truly an inspirational movie that should garner many Oscar nominations including one for Best Picture, and one for Best Supporting Actress for Thandie Newton who plays Gardner's impatient wife, as well as an award nomination and win for both Smith and son!

One of the best films of 2006.

2745912,5,B000MRA59M,"As a big Will Smith fan, I was hoping for a great performance by the actor in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"".  In ""Men in Black"", ""Enemy of the State"", and ""I, Robot"" Smith delivered amazing performances.  In ""Ali"", ""Bad Boys II"", and ""Wild Wild West"", Smith not only delivered lackluster performances, but he chose scripts that really failed to deliver anything worth the price of admission.  But this film, this absolute brilliant masterpiece of movie making creativity, deserves a whole lot of recognition!

  ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is one of the most ""real-to-life"" movies to come around in a while.  The script is energetic, interesting, and smart; the acting is second to none; and the performance Will Smith turns in is without a doubt his best work to date.

  This is the kind of movie that can inspire people to see past their struggles and look toward the light at the end of the tunnel.  People who are going through financial, spiritual, and mental struggles need a film like ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" to remind them that lots of people have struggled, are struggling, and will struggle to be the best they can be in life.

  Will Smith (playing the role of Chris Gardner) and his on screen wife, Linda (played by Thandie Newton), are exceptionally convincing as two parents trying to make things work when everything in their lives seems to be falling apart.  Smith is stunningly realistic as a man just about to go over the deep end as life throws him as many punches as his Ali character actually took in the boxing ring.  Some of the scenes where Smith and Newton are verbally jousting looked as if a physical confrontation was about to come to fruition, but it doesn't.

  Smith had to rely on every single emotion, physical characteristics of humans, and making another person's story appear as his own to pull this film off.  This is his crowning achievement as far as this critic is concerned.  Much like Val Kilmer could make movies from now until the day he is unable to act and never be able to top his performance as Doc Holiday in the movie ""Tombstone"", Will Smith may never be able to rise above his accomplishments in this performance.

  Jaden Smith plays the part of Christopher (Chris Gardner's son) and is just as convincing as his real life father throughout the entire film.  The two work magic on the big screen.  And as much as I don't get into the whole put-a-cute-kid-in-a-movie-and-you-can't-lose philosophy, Jaden Smith is a kid you just can't help but enjoy seeing say predictable things in the movie.  The kid doesn't overact at all.  That's a big plus for a film like this, where it is based on a true story.

  Brian Howe (playing the part of Jay Twistle) is great as the man who gives Gardner his first big shot at a more positive future.  His fascination with the Rubik's Cube while riding in a taxi, Gardner begging him for a chance at becoming a stockbroker, is a scene I won't soon forget.  Two men in a taxi, trying to solve Rubik's Cube, with one of the men trying to find a way to solve the puzzle of his own life, and one man not even realizing the desperation that was riding beside him in the taxi; now that's irony.  Isn't that exactly what causes a lot of the pain we see in the world today - the lack of one group of humans to see the needs and thoughts of another group of humans?

  Will Smith is a great actor, and he seems like a genuinely good person with a great future.  He is not your typical Hollywood Big Head, with the all the superstar baggage we see with most of the Hollywood elite.  The main character in this movie seems like the best example of what Smith's real life integrity is like; and it's a good statement!  I wish Smith and his family all the best!  Thanks for working so hard on this film.

  If you are reading this review and trying to decide if ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a movie worth seeing, just ask yourself if you are interested in the story of human struggle.  If the answer is yes, then I suggest you see this film.

  See ya next review!",1167091200,4,4036,4.486932599724897
2745913,4,B000MRA59M,"Father and Son performances that will take your breath away. Not the greatest movie, a little slow at times, but Will and young Jaden Smith make for one of the best duels of the year. Thandie Newton very believably plays the haggard and stressed wife and mother. Great acting ensemble all around.

The kid definitely has a future ahead of him should he pursue it. Will Smith is very convincing in his characterized climb from the bottom to the top. Probably his best work to date.

It's never too late to achieve our dreams!",1167091200,,524,4.5638297872340425
2745914,4,B000MRA59M,"It's within every subtlety, the redness of his eyes, the quivering of his chin and the weariness with which he watches his son that Will Smith delivers one of the year's finest performances.  I've always been a fan of Will Smith, and this film really shows he's more than just a funny guy, he really can express real emotion, and it's the subtlety with which he expresses it that really shows his acting chops.  In a role that could have easily been `over-acted', Will Smith gives us raw human feeling and emotion that we can all relate to and understand.

As Chris Gardener, a man who made a few bad decisions and is now paying the price, Will Smith shows us many layers of this man.  He's angry with his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) for her lack of faith in him...he's disappointed in himself for not having been more than he is...and most of all he's scared of disappointing his son Christopher (Jaden Smith).  After venturing into the business of selling a bone density x-ray machine, a machine that is all but impossible to sell, Chris ends up broke and unable to keep his family together.  His wife Linda leaves him and soon he's thrown out of his apartment and left on the street.

In an attempt to make a better life for his son Chris enrolls in an internship with a local Stock Brokerage Firm and really pushes himself to be the best he can in order to get the job and provide for his family.  Yes, there are times when this film feels very slow, long and even generic.  They repeat a lot of scenes in order to really show the horrible state he and his son were in, the obstacles he had to overcome all in hopes to make his triumph in the end all the more heartwarming, but it's really Will Smith's performance that makes the film what it is...that and his chemistry with real life son Jaden who definitely takes after his father and serves up one of the most endearing and real characters brought to the cinema this year.

Yes, `The Pursuit of Happyness' may be the `Cinderella Man' of 2006 (personally `Cinderella Man' was the better film), but with powerful performances but the two Smiths it's brought to a different level and made worthy of the viewers time, attention and money...and Will Smith I'm sure with rightfully receive his second Oscar nomination!",1167091200,,2270,4.528117359413203
2745915,4,B000MRA59M,"It's hard not to review this movie with my heart instead of my head.  I found the film to be inspirational, and it had me glued to the screen.  I would recommend it heartily to be seen in the theater, and not to wait for the DVD.

It is formulaic, there is little suspense, and director Gabriele Muccino makes sure that you understand not only the happy ending, but the hardship.  The chemistry between Will Smith and his son Jaden makes the film work, and both Smith and Thandie Newton give performances that remind us of just how good they both are.

While the film does not really visit the theme of how growing up black and male in America and especially in dysfunctional circumstances, (as Gardner's book did)can cause you to lose hope -- it does show us the despair and fear, leading to anger and regret, that comes of taking risks and finding yourself waking up poor.  With the right touch, the filmmakers emphasize that Gardner's willingness to pursue, really pursue, a better life for he and his son, made a difference.

A fine film.",1167004800,3,1042,4.540106951871658
2745916,5,B000MRA59M,"Based upon the true story of Chris Gardner (with the inevitable sprinkling of dramatic license elements), Will Smith and his real-life son steal your heart. This is not your typical Hollywood telling in which the main character starts out strong, takes a little dip, then easily succeeds. Instead, Will Smith's character takes dip after dip after dip until your exhausted watching him failing again and again. Yet . . . you root for him again and again and again.

Smith shows that he is so much more than simply a comic actor. He is a four-star actor in this four-star film. If you want to be challenged to never, ever give up hope, then watch the Pursuit of Happyness.

2745917,4,B000MRA59M,"Starring Will Smith, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is a highly recommended film about Chris Gardner's rise from homeless, medical equipment salesman to Wall Street stockbroker.

Far from the typical Hollywood feel-good film, this isn't the sweet, happy tale the commercials and trailers promise.  Instead THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is the dark story of an intelligent man whose entire life falls apart after a series of bad decisions and unfortunately timed consequences.

As it begins we viewers know that everything will eventually turn out joyfully, but never does director Gabriele Muccino spare us the pains of this single father.  Instead we are left in our seats, cringing for two hours as Gardner faces a biblical struggle to be a caring, loving father while living in a homeless shelter and trying to get a job at a competitive San Francisco brokerage house.

Radical for a big Hollywood film, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS is surprisingly pro-American and pro-capitalism.  As Smith himself has noted in countless interviews, this is a true story that never could have happened in any other country.  Though no one could ever say that Gardner had an easy time, the film shows how one man succeeded in changing his life through his own intelligence and hard work.

Recommended to those who appreciate rags-to-riches stories, this film can be appreciated on many other levels.  First it offers a sympathetic look at an African-American man who is determined to be a hero in his own life and in the rearing of his only child, played by Smith's real life eight-year old son Jaden.

Second, the film is visually interesting because its set designers and costumers are obsessive in their accurate depiction of the home dcor and clothing styles of the early 1980s.  Third and most importantly, the film promotes a view of African-American men that we never see on TV, in newspapers or in other films.

My only quibble, and the reason I cannot give THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS five stars is that the actions and motivations of Gardner's wife, played by Thandie Newton, are not fully explained.  There has to be a reason that she left her son to live with his homeless father, while she moved to another state.  Unfortunately the filmmaker never revealed it.
