1234792,3,B00000JN2F,"If I had to describe Jack-O in three words, I'd say Goosebumps for adults. Because that's exactly what the movie felt like. The gratuitous nudity aside (there's a lengthy shower scene featuring Linnea Quigley that serves no real purpose other than to show Linnea Quigley naked in the shower), the quality of the acting, the scenes and the overall feel of the film was very R.L. Stein, very low budget. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's just something you should be aware of before watching Jack-O. Especially if you were expecting a serious horror film. I'm not going to be as harsh as most of the other reviewers because I went into this film expecting exactly what I got. A lower end B Grade horror flick with not so great acting and so-so special effects. Jack-O is definitely not one of Linnea Quigley's better films. But if your a completist like me, and you want all of the lovely Linnea's films then this is a must have.",1347667200,,935,4.571428571428571
1234793,1,B00000JN2F,"Jack-O (Steve Latshaw, 1995)

Seriously, someone ripped off Pumpkinhead? Think about the silliness inherent in that concept. And then browse IMDB and find out that Fred Olen Ray was involved. Ah, now suddenly everything makes sense. Ray is a maestro of mediocrity, a Caligari of crap, a sorcerer of... well, okay, you get the idea. In any case, anecdotal evidence has it that Ray had a couple of unrelated film clips of John Carradine and Cameron Mitchell, and dared screenwriter Brad Linaweaver (The Brain Leeches) to come up with a story that used them both. This was the result. Patrick Moran (Vampire Trailer Park) was brought in to do a bit of script doctoring, and roped in his pal Steve Latshaw, who'd also directed VTP. The end result is... well. Um.

So, yeah, sorcerer dies back in the day and curses the town, blah blah blah, then he rises again on Halloween night, having taken on the personality of a much better monster from a much better monster movie, and sets about killing people. (There's a weak storyline given as to why he does so, but it is entirely inconsistent with his actions.) Yeah, that's basically it.

Let's face it, if you're watching Jack-O, you're watching it because you've heard that both Brinke Stevens and Linnea Quigley are in it. This is true. There are also some other hot horror babes involved (Helen Keeling [who has never been seen on screen again, for reasons that will become obvious when you watch the movie], Maddisen Krown, Rachel Carter, and a couple of others with bit parts). And if that's enough for you, then by all means, have at it. But be prepared, because this movie is a dog and a half, and the special effects on the half-dog have something to do with strawberry jam. *",1281052800,,1728,4.659016393442623
1234794,2,B00000JN2F,"A family's curse brings back the spirit of Jack-O, The Pumpkin Man, who returns to drag more souls back with him to hell. The producing credit for Fred Olen Ray should be a clear indicator of what fans can expect in the scenes to follow. JACK-O is the poor man's PUMPKINHEAD, and a literal one at that, considering the character's name and the jack-o-lantern that adorns his head. It is hard to tell which of the performances were intentionally terrible and which were just terrible, but in either case, the acting in the picture is remarkably bad and played entirely straight. JACK-O somehow manages cameos from genre greats Cameron Mitchell, John Carradine, and Linnea Quigley, each of whom are given throwaway roles for what little money they must have been paid. Even with his cheap latex mask and scarecrow costume, Jack-O's silent, jagged grimace is sufficiently creepy when contrasted against the choking smoke from the fog machines. Though it poses some of the lamest low-budget FX, there are a few bloody gags to satiate the hardcore gore fan. JACK-O is just another tiresome, derivative Slasher with all of the makings of a bad B-movie.

1234795,3,B00000JN2F,"On our list for a while has been a lesser known cult horror that appeared to be in the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>"" field called Jack-O. Well there's no question to it's quality being that of Wicked Games because this couldn't have cost more then $500 to make, and that is very generous assumption. Right from the opening credits it's made quite clear either you back out now or force yourself into an hour an a half of some low budget laughs. For us the choice is simple. We live for B and all the horrible acting, effects, and dialogue it can throw at us. Unfortunately is wasn't quite as entertaining as we were hoping for but certainly gave us enough chuckles to earn itself a healthy 3 star rating.

Amidst an incredible amount of plot holes we managed to somewhat figure out what was going on in Jack-O. It starts off with some kid sporting a giant pair of specs who happened to be a relative of Jack-O-Lanterns first victim. The kid has a lot of visions of the Jack-O character who is nothing more then a guy walking around with a pumpkin mask on. See Jack-O's grave was tampered with causing him to rise up and seek vengeance on the descendants on the family that took him out long ago. Beyond what we attempted to piece together is nothing more then some of the worst acting and hilarious effects ever caught on tape. The greatest part had to be when one of the victims got shocked by a toaster with unreal graphics of voltage shooting through her body then turning her into a skeleton with hair. It's simply something you must see to understand.

When deciding on what Jack-O is worth it really depends on the viewer. For us it was pretty entertaining and  provided enough laughs to keep us satisfied for a one time only watch. However if you are looking for a real scary flick, which would be confusing to us if you'd be considering this for that reason, then by no means attempt to watch Jack-O. This is a film only meant for those who love that of the ""so good it's bad"" variety and can appreciate a very poorly made movie. It's pretty amazing how this one never showed up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 because it is right up there with their typical caliber of movie.",1268092800,,2297,4.680693069306931

1234798,1,B00000JN2F,"Any horror film that features John Carradine, Cameron Mitchell, and an extensive nude scene with Linnea Quigley can't be all bad, right?  Well, naked beauties and old cult actors do not a good horror movie make, and 1995's cheesy no-budget film JACK-O supports this axiom.

The film takes place in a small Florida town where, unbeknownst to the inhabitants, a bloodthirsty, scythe-wielding, pumpkin-headed demon has been called forth in fulfillment of a nearly forgotten curse.  As the demon rises up and gathers the strength it needs to begin its rampage, a small and timid boy named David Kelly starts having dreams about the coming carnage.  It seems that one of David's ancestors caused a lot of trouble for some warlock (John Carradine) back in the early 1900s, and the warlock therefore placed the curse on the town.  With the help of one of the warlock's good-hearted descendants, David learns that, as a fifth-generation descendant of the warlock's original adversary, only he has the power to destroy Jack-O the demon and save the town and its people from the wicked curse.

Unfortunately, the highly unoriginal plot isn't bolstered any by the unconvincing low-tech FX, the direct-to-video-tape cinematography, or the fact that the eponymous monster appears to have come straight off the rack of a costume-rental shop.  The overall performances are also quite wooden and unnatural, the only exceptions being those of the aforementioned Ms. Quigley, Mr. Carradine, and Mr. Mitchell.  Yet even the performances from Mr. Carradine and Mr. Mitchell seem oddly out of place. Of course, both men were deceased by the time JACK-O was made, and it's quite obvious that the stars' appearances here are achieved via footage salvaged from the cutting-room floor of previous flicks.

JACK-O isn't without a few near-redeeming qualities, however.  There is a fantastically stimulating shower scene in which the comely Ms. Quigley shows off ALL of her cinematic assets, and there is another scene later in the movie in which a cute brunette (Rachel Carter) flashes her nubile nibs.  For fans of the bad cinema, there are lots of cheesy one-liners that will elicit chuckles and can be ridiculed in the MST3K tradition.  Also, in spite of the low productions values, JACK-O does have a spooky, Halloween-like atmosphere.  Nothing that happens on the screen is the least bit frightening, mind you, but at least there's some creepy atmosphere.

All in all, JACK-O offers very little of what fans are seeking in a horror flick.  True, there is a little bit of T&A and a couple of dead cult stars, but that's just not enough to sustain the interest of the modern fright fan. Sadly, there isn't enough intentional cheese in JACK-O to make it a cheesy horror comedy, and it isn't even bad enough to be a so-bad-it's-good flick.  It's just plain bad.

The Special-Edition, 10th-Anniversary DVD from Image Entertainment offers an uncut, unrated version of JACK-O.  There are also several bonus supplements, but none serve to enhance enjoyment or understanding of the feature film whatsoever.

Note: The one-star rating is for horror fans in general.  For those horror fans (especially fans of Linnea Quigley) primarily seeking T&A within the context of spooky atmosphere, one star can be added.",1155945600,,3279,5.093457943925234

The acting is terrific, especially the sexy Linnea Quigley, and the Fonzy Award winning Tom Ferda.  The toaster scene alone is worth the rental. Pat Moran works double duty as the screenwriter and the Jack-O himself!!  This one was much better that Latshaw's last film ""Dark Universe"".. A must see!!!",1111708800,,442,4.918918918918919
1234801,1,B00000JN2F,"Well if you've seen Jack-O on display either in the store, or on the net hoping it will be a Halloween treat, think again.  Jack-O-Lantern is a side note in time at best.

The film centers around the Kelly's, who have a history which Brings Jack-O out hunting them Halloween night.  Five generations ago Mr. Kelly and a neighbor kill an evil magician because he had murdered some of the townsfolk.  When the magician dies however, he vows revenge on the Kelly's and anyone else who is close to them.  Thus 90 years later a trio of drunk college students accidentally bring Jack-O to life by knocking over the wood cross seal which held the magicain at bay.  (important to note that the magician and Jack-O are not the same person.  Jack-O is a demon who is doing the magicain's bidding)

Jack-O goes through the neighborhood with a sickle slashing down some of the neighbors but is mainly after the Kellly's.  Particularly Sean Kelly (about 10-12 years old)  Since he is the fifith generation and is the only one who can kill Jack-O.  Well the movie progresses through some lame acting and disappointing special effecs until Sean and his father impale Jack-O on a new wooden cross which sends him back to hell.

Jack-O could have been a cool movie as you can tell from the plot, but the problem with it was most likely the budget.  All the acting is poor.  Except for one or two actors who wern't even main characters.  There is absolutely no scares in this film.  I swear the Goosebumps series for kids in the 90's had much scarier episodes.  And Jack-o himself was a walking pumpkin.  Could have been scary, but not the way this director shot the film.  The gore was lame and the death scene of choice usually involved Jack-O in a slashing motion, cutting to a scene of the actor clutching his neck.  Also, the movie doesn't follow it's own rules.  By this I mean Jack-O takes a couple of side trips to cut down people who have nothing to do with the Kelly's when they are supposed to be his target.

The special features include an audio comentary, trailer, some behind the scenes footage (again lame didn't help the DVD at all)  and a featurette of another film by the same director, Gator Babes.  Apparently the film was never finished and so they put what they had on the disc with Jack-O.  Gator Babes! Need I say more!

Trust me, if you want a cool fright flick around Halloween don't choose Jack-O.  It dosn't deliver on any level.  THis is the 10th anniversy edition I noticed too.  Well for a 94 film, this movie really is below par.  I've warned you, so buy at your own risk. My advice is that they take out some of the lame gore, and the two naked lady scenes, and make this a kids flick.  Kids are the only ones who might get scared watching this film.

The plot approaches total nonsense (what jumps to mind: shower scenes that appear from nowhere, along with footage seemingly cobbled in from a separate film), the characters are as obnoxious as is humanly possible, and the acting is the worst -- there is one fantastic scene at the end, where as the child is being buried by the monster, mumbles ""No..."" in a bored voice..

I was amased when I saw this on an upcoming DVD release schedule. Needless to say I snapped it up as soon as it was released. Each of the characters are so unlikeable and irritating, one almost thinks it was done on purpose. All of the acting is exceptionally bad, with each actor (???) having something particular that makes them stand out in their own bad way. Poor Vivian, the woman that comes from nowhere to attempt to save the day, has this nagging problem with her mouth that makes her appear as if she's being grossed out on a regular basis. Mom has these EXTRA large eyes that open beyond belief at any opportunity. The ultimate worst is Sean, the little boy who's Pumpkin Man's target. This boy is so deadpan and bored looking that you get the impression that his real father, the films director, forced him to be in this flick. That, or the boy just has zero personality. He delivers lines like ""no"", while he's being buried by Jack-O, and ""Leave my mom and dad alone"", with the most bored tone that you expect a yawn to follow. Hysterical in it's blatant badness. The few death scenes appear to incorporate dummies made in a childrens art class. Another example of a really bad scene: After meeting Sean, Vivian is outside his home talking with his parents. Sean goes in the house, falls down and has a vision of Jack-O. Moments later Vivian picks him up and, while looking at mom, states that Sean had a bad dream. OK, 3 in the afternoon, the boy goes in the house for 20 seconds but still has time to fall asleep, in the middle of the floor, and have a bad dream with no one acknowledging it as odd? O....K..??

More action, seemingly less horrendous acting, an outstanding Linnea Quigley shower scene which suitably poses no relevance to the storyline, a couple of decent kills involving electrocution from a toaster and a decapitation that brings a wry smile along with some humour in the form of an uptight right-wing guy getting off on his Fox News type TV show whilst the trick or treating kids he was mean to toilet paper his house.
