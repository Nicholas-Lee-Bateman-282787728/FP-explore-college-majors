5113831,3,B007X1K450,"I decided to order this DVD after seeing this same SNL Special on MTV.  I waited for it to come back on, and when it did and I got to see the episode all the way through I knew I had to own it.  The DVD is a great collection of skits...  HOWEVER, I was disappointed that many of the skit that were on the original episode on MTV, DID NOT make the cut for the DVD.  Still a good over all purchase though.",1369180800,,403,3.761904761904762
5113832,5,B007X1K450,"Very good video, very funny showing the very best of those talented ladies. You got to have it.  Kristy Wigg, Gosh! you are so missed very much.",1365120000,,144,4.333333333333333
5113833,5,B007X1K450,I would recommend this to any SNL fan.. or anybody who loves to laugh! These women are amazing and sooo  funny! I watch whenever I need a good laugh. I have seen it tons of times but every time is like the first!! Must have!!,1361404800,,225,4.0
5113834,5,B007X1K450,"This was bought as a gift. It worked fine with no issues. If you like SNL, you will enjoy seeing the classic clips.",1360022400,,115,4.043478260869565
5113835,4,B007X1K450,"Funny women rule, boys!!!! these ladies are hysterical!! I LOVE the Debby Downer sketch where everybody keeps cracking up!!! BRAVA!!",1358035200,,132,5.65
5113836,5,B007X1K450,"This was a brilliantly put together compilation, I laughed the entire time. This would definitely make a great volume 2 as I feel a lot of the older stuff has been left out, and theres a lot more hilarious skits from 90s/00s. Also Victoria Jackson wasn't featured at all. And the one review saying Mary Gross deserved inclusion over Julia Loius Dreyfus, Julia only has one skit featured and Mary Gross is also in it. It doesn't bother me so much that the older stuff wasn't covered as much since the first 5 seasons are available on dvd and I also picked up the best of Gilda Radner. Otherwise the collection of clips was hilarious and featured plenty of Kristin Wiig and a lot of the late 90s/00s women, which were arguably some of the funniest women on the show. Molly Shannon, Ana Gasteyer, Cheri Oteri, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch, and, Maya Rudolph. If you're a fan of any or all of those ladies, you will enjoy this dvd. There are a few moments in which they show clips of Gilda, Jane and Laraine as well with a bit of Nora Dunn but mostly the others. Theres also a featurette on the DVD interviewing the women about working on the show, I found it interesting. All in all well worth the money. NBC needs to create a volume 2. Along with best ofs for Andy Samberg and Kristin Wiig.",1357516800,4,1296,4.381742738589212
5113837,3,B007X1K450,"IT LACKS SUBSTANCE, AND IS OBVIOUSLY STAGED AND FORCED.  IT LACKS A HISTORICAL OVERVIEW AND IS NOT
A UNIQUE OFFERING.",1356739200,,117,4.85
5113838,4,B007X1K450,"Good selection, decent bonus features.  Wish it was a bit longer, excellent gift for any snl fans, does a good job of combining the first seasons with the most recent.",1344211200,3,167,4.566666666666666
5113839,4,B007X1K450,"While this may not be near the complete collection that the women of Saturday Night Live deserve, what is here is excellent. It contains some real gems, including Debbie Downer at Disney World, Oprah's Favorite Things, and the outstanding classic skit with Jan Hooks and Nora Dunn as two waitresses in a diner with customer Alec Baldwin. The extras are very good including some 'dress sketches' that make you wonder why they didn't make the final live show. The new footage filmed for this collection has most of the women assembled together in the studio to celebrate these sketches and their history. It's a lot of fun.

I saw ""The Women of SNL"" when it aired on TV about a year ago and was hoping it would be released on DVD.  Very glad to own it now!",1341964800,13,754,4.4963503649635035
5113840,3,B007X1K450,"I was very excited to pick of this DVD, but I knew full well it could never live up to expectations. The ""Women of SNL"" deserve a box set based on years of the show. Trying to honor the women on one disc just doesn't cut it. Also, SNL has a knack of releasing the ""less funny"" skits of popular characters. They never seem to release the most beloved or well remembered skits.

I really wonder who puts these things together. There's too many inconsequential full skits and too few of the ""classic"" iconic moments. There are several montages that are great, but only emphasize how little care was taken in this compilation. Jane Curtin is pretty much ignored. If you are a hardcore fan of the ladies, I'd really say rent it. I cant see going back to it much.

The featurette on the extras is almost better than the whole compilation. Also, Julia Louis Dreyfus is included, mainly I believe due to her later success on Seinfeld. She never really made an impact when she was on the show. Mary Gross was a far more talented comic on the show and deserved inclusion over Julia. Wiig gets ALOT of attention on the compilation, I suppose because she is responsible for the shows success the last few years, but it's a huge disrespect to the other women, many of whom paved the way for Wiig.

All in all-lackluster. I wouldn't recommend a purchase.",1341446400,39,1340,4.483606557377049

5113847,2,B007X1K450,The original women of snl that aired live on tv had some of the best skits but the dvd was missing a majority of them. Much disappoint  Not that it's not funny but it just sucks that a lot of them are missing.,1461888000,,209,3.86046511627907
5113848,4,B007X1K450,"I know its hard to fit everything into a two hour special, but I feel they could have invited more of the ladies of SNL. Show was very entertaining and it was great to see Jan Hooks before she passed away. The Debbie Downer skit is still one of my favs, the cast & Lindsay Lohan can't seem to keep it together and its hilarious!",1451952000,,328,4.061538461538461

5113852,3,B007X1K450,"of course with all these ladies in one DVD, of course it will be funny, but I did not laugh nearly as much as I should have. The first like 10 minutes or so is all the actresses in a real housewives show reunion type set up answering questions from some unknown host. So much time is later spent on the actresses individually talking about some of their favorite sketches growing up. There are very few full length sketches on the DVD and instead they just cut short bits of some of the BEST ones to make a small montage out of it.

In the end, it was just $6 so I suppose it was worth a buy but definitely not what I was expecting",1435276800,3,631,4.048

5113861,2,B007X1K450,"As usual The DVD has multiple skits from other SNL DVD's. It is really foolish, and stupid for them to do but for some reason despite all the years of episodes they have these idiots still use the same skits over and over in their DVD's. The only difference between this one and others that I have is that the women of SNL has way more skits from other DVD's then normal. At least 10- if it were not for that, I would have been a great buy. I feel this is the last SNL I buy as there is no point with all these skits being reused over and over in each.",1419465600,3,552,3.893805309734513

5113874,3,B007X1K450,"I wanted this DVD so bad. I don't like the intro format similar to reality shows reunions.
Many skits are just seconds long and are not complete as the originally aired versions.
Of course we all laughed, but I wish it was longer.",1391040000,2,230,4.372093023255814

5113880,2,B007X1K450,"I know humor is an art and is subjective.
Most of this just does Not grab me.
I bought this for Rachel Dratch's 'Debbie Downer' - which is in full-screen - while most of his DVD is in Wide-screen. - And only ONE Debbie Downer skit - I think she did others (Didn't she?).
Another skit about a woman who is Crazed about setting up surprise birthday parties - that Really cracked me up.
Even some serious and insightful interviews would have been great.
SNL could have done a better job with this DVD.",1384214400,,498,4.308510638297872
