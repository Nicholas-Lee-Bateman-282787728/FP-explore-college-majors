This film documents the life of a Brazilian man who was born with natural abilities as a ""sensitive"".  He was able to see into people and see physical, mental and spiritual problems they had.  He was capable as a healer.  He could speak to the spirits of those who have passed away.  He channeled more than 400 books--all of which needed NO editing.  So, his gifts were ample; but more importantly he donated all that he had and all he earned through his spiritual work so that orphanages, schools and eldercare centers could be established and maintained to help people.  He was like a saint, in Brazil, because of his love, generosity and charity.
If you have the gift of being a sensitive and are struggling to bring that forward into a culture that does not respect or honor sensitives---this is the film for you.",1430524800,2,948,4.737804878048781
8416934,4,B00461L2OM,"There is a great interest in Chico and for those looking for English subtitles
I highly recommend ""The Astral City"" which has subtitles and is the same
as ""Nosso Lar."" I also wish Amazon would list if there are English
subtitles and because of the country code held back on my wish to
buy the document on his life: ""Chico Xavier."" For Bob or others having
the same problem go to YouTube for English subtitles:

His books sold an estimated 50 million copies, the profits of which were all channelled into charity work. In 1981 and 1982, he was nominated for the Nobel peace prize",1334016000,5,250,5.121951219512195

I just loved it.",1291075200,5,131,4.28
8416940,3,B00461L2OM,"I've bought this movie as a great admirer of Chico's charity work and spirituality.  However, much of his amazing life was left out or not deeply approached. I've bought it with great expectations and was a bit dissapointed.  But then, you can always buy it, watch it, then re-sell it on Amazon, since not available at rental stores.",1290297600,3,333,4.724137931034483
