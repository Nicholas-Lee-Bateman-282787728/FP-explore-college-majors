4580409,4,B0055SNHQG,"This was one of my favorite shows of the 2010 season. I feel the producers really botched what could have been a great direction for the ""Law and Order"" series.
It wasn't given enough time to catch fire. Look at some of the ""crap"" thats going into multiple seasons, you know who you are!
Anyway, I'll buy the first and only season and enjoy it for what it was.",1315612800,24,360,4.231884057971015
4580410,4,B0055SNHQG,"Law and Order: Los Angeles was a Southern California-based spinoff of the long-running procedural franchise that premiered during the 2010-11 TV season.  One of the things that was interesting about this spinoff was NBC greenlighting it without a Pilot or Cast.  After a pretty good cast was assembled which included veteran actors Skeet Ulrich, Terrence Howard, Alfred Molina, the show underwent major changes.  1st, after the Pilot was shot, NBC recast the Lt. Arleen Gonzalez, then played by Wanda DeJesus, with veteran TV actor Rachel Ticotin.  The show had good, but unspectacular ratings on it's Wednesday at 10pm timeslot, then after episode 8, the show went on hiatus and that's when the craziness began.  NBC decided to hold off on bringing back the show and decided to make some major creative changes, which included killing off one of the lead characters, firing 2 additional cast members and then giving one of the supporting characters a lead role and job change.  Also a veteran of the Law and Order mothership show was brought in.  After all this tinkering was done, the show finally returned to NBC after a 4 month hiatus and to a new timeslot.  Ratings dropped and the show ended up getting cancelled in May 2011.  I enjoyed the show when it began, but I realize there was nothing that made it stand out from being just another cop and law procedural.  Putting on a 4 month hiatus killed any momentum it was gaining, which is too bad because I believe the re-tooling actually made it a better cop show.  Despite how ridiculous it was, switching Alfred Molina from DDA to Cop actually worked.  I think he developed solid chemistry with Corey Stoll as partners.  I also think the cases during their episodes were alot more compelling.  And I also appreciated that Stoll shaved off the goofy porn mustache from earlier in the season.  Also bringing in Alana de la Garza from the original Law and Order was a great move.  No offense to Megan Boone or Regina Hall, but de la Garza is a much better actress and Connie Rubirosa is a better written character.  I'm not sure how the episodes will be placed on this DVD set, but they aired out of order when they were shown on NBC.  ""Hayden Tract"" ,which aired as episode 15 on NBC, was the intended season finale.  Also, episodes 18-22 on NBC were actually intended to air as episodes 9-13, but were burned off after the show was cancelled.  If you can buy this set for under $20, I would recommend it.",1313884800,63,2461,4.665893271461717
4580411,5,B0055SNHQG,"I really enjoyed the change in venue for LAW & ORDER when they began an LA spinoff.  The lawyers and police had a decidedly west coast flair and the sets were pure LA.  I really like that NBC was venturing into TNT territory explored in their THE CLOSER, and I thought the cast had real potential to gell, but it didn't happen fast enough to net enough viewers, apparently.  However, the series worked for me---especially bringing Alfred Molina on board frist among the lawyers then back on the street.
The plots were intriguing, not immediately solvable, and again, had that west coast vibe.
All good things must come to an end, but I look forward to getting this set when it become available and will enjoy seeing the episodes again and again.",1310947200,53,745,4.628787878787879
4580414,5,B0055SNHQG,too bad they didn't make anymore of the Los Angeles version - i actually loved it,1498780800,,81,4.125
4580415,4,B0055SNHQG,"This Californian version of this series did not last long. It is true Los Angeles is a lot less spectacular than New York, Miami or Las Vegas, or even Washington DC. I am told that Sacramento is also quite attractive.

The stories are interesting always a little bit easy. Simple very direct crime stories and concentration on the prosecution and attorneys vision of things. It will not surprise Americans, but it will surprise even flabbergast anyone from another judicial system. To avoid as many court cases as possible deals are encouraged. Plead guilty for leniency and be a witness against other culprits to get a deal and total or partial immunity. Where is justice?

That explains some cases of self-justice: take justice in your own hands and get your vengeance performed in the name of self-defense. At least that is sustainable: you get the fair result you expect and it encourages the process to go on forever. You add to that the fact that there are more crimes in Los Angeles than in New York and you have the key to the lackluster series. Exceptional people in Los Angeles are the innocent and law abiding people. All the others are all criminals, crooked individuals and many other things. Too much concentration on hookers and other characters of this night time orgasmic life tied up to drugs makes it slightly humdrum.

The cases are just interesting but never really fascinating and the procedure is always sketchy. Do they ever read the Miranda rights to the people they arrest? Not once. Slightly more interesting about court procedure, but still quite sketchy.

Thats probably why it was not stillborn but it died of Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). There is a severe competition on this market of thrillers and detective or police cases. Even J.K. Rowling writes some, under a male name though: she must be ashamed of her stooping so low to conquer an audience, when she had one anyway with Harry Potter.

4580435,4,B0055SNHQG,"I really liked this show and the great cast.  Skeet Ulrich was my favorite.  I didn't like how some episodes didn't have real closure.  The bad guys always need to get their comeuppance, especially when they kill the star.

4580436,3,B0055SNHQG,I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as the others in the franchise. They were boring and the characters were flat. It also didn't help that my set came with two disc 1&2 and no 3&4!,1473811200,,180,4.027777777777778

4580439,2,B0055SNHQG,this show seems to take too much direction from the network. A few episodes into the season they kill off and have the da become a cop! a few episodes later they bring back the dead and never mention the fact that he was murdered. There's no explanation for how he came back and the ADA goes back to being an ada. I believe they change the opening to the show as well. it certainly seems to be a comic spoof on CSI and cold case files and all of those,1466035200,,451,3.967032967032967

4580458,5,B0055SNHQG,This was a different type of law and order I like,1458172800,,49,3.5454545454545454
4580459,2,B0055SNHQG,"The underlying stories aren't bad, but the shots are very dark and depressing, there is no humor like the original law&order and spin off shows, initially characters are hard to understand as no real intro of each exists, stories don't flow, characters don't get along so there is too much fighting detracting from the story, etc. If I was watching the show when it aired, I wouldn't have gotten past the 3rd show.

In most episodes there are just too many gaps the viewer has to fill in.  Too many contradictions if you watch closely as you can with a dvd.

Then we have the major plot screw up where one of the cops is killed and a DA returns to being a detective (like that would happen) and the partner tries to find the murderer in mexico.  Several shows later and poof, the dead cop mysteriously is alive and on the job as if nothing happened and the DA is back to being a DA. No transition or explanation.

Looks like this series was just thrown together as an after thought because details are missing.  I don't  blame the actors, but they were given awful lines.",1456963200,,1071,4.406091370558376

I must be one of the few who doesnt care for the original series, i watched a few reruns on USA and it just felt too old for me. I bought LOLA and Exiled here on Amazon and I thought L&O Los Angeles was great. Yea it did have its mix ups with the out of order episodes but it really had potential. After the hiatus, and bringing back Morales as a cop with tj and him shaving that dumb mustache, they really polished the show up and could have kept the improvements into a second season but they cancelled it anyway. I bought it mainly because of the low price and i think this was a great deal because i really enjoyed this show.",1433462400,2,737,4.020408163265306

4580614,5,B0055SNHQG,"I liked watching this series, but I purchased it because it featured Alfred Molina and Terrence Howard. I may be one of the few that never watched the Law & Order shows (I've only seen a few of them over the years). Like I said, the Show gets a 4, but I added an Extra Star for the compelling acting of both Molina and Howard. Since I am not really familiar with the long running Law & Order series, I can not compare those programs with this series. The order in which the shows were presented in this package  (appearing to be non-sequential--and they are) throws everything off, but this is discussed and explained in the commentary in one of the programs. Not that it really improves the viewing experience, but I appreciated it and it lends clarity. So again 4 stars for the series and an extra star for the excellent performances of both Molina and Howard (I think they're both great actors).",1413676800,,898,4.475609756097561

Who doesn't miss Law & Order?  It had a good start with a mashing up of Law & Order SVU with L&O:Los Angeles but didn't work out so....",1413504000,2,385,3.740740740740741

4580617,3,B0055SNHQG,"Overall, I enjoyed the series.  But it was in very strange order.  Something happens about halfway in and then the last episodes are definitely not in sequence.  I don't want to do a spoiler, but someone dies than magically just reappears in later episodes, so definitely not in sequence.  Also I couldn't get the last two episodes on the fifth and final dvd to even play no matter what I did.  So they're either not there or somehow damaged.

Then - miraculously - Winters shows up again in the last few episodes.  This series was not consistent, and didn't live up to the other Law and Order series.

Terrance Howard is a good actor but he seemed to lack the hard edges that Jack McCoy and Mike Cutter had as prosecutors.  Maybe it's all that California sun but I did like Cary Stoll's character.  Also, it took almost a month for me to get the series from the vendor with the excuse that the little ""Mom and Pop"" post office in his town kept slipping up with mailing it.

The entire season it existed was aired out of order, and a mad dash for ratings was made as it did not evolve the way a successful show should have. The ""straight from the headlines"" story plots are there, along with a star studded cast, but a poor delivery in the timeline of the show, in my opinion, was its ultimate downfall. With that being said, if one was to take the time to watch the episodes in order, they would have much more appreciation for it. It is still very much so worth watching, and while it all fell apart, the brilliant minds who brought the rest of the franchise tried to do an excellent job.

4580785,5,B0055SNHQG,"What a tragic loss!  This show should still be on the air and running for another 15 years!

The cast was unbelievable!  Skeet Ulrich, Terence Howard and Alfred Molina?!  Are you kidding me!  All in the same series!  Corey Stoll grew and grew on me also.

I already loved Law & Order, Law & Order SVU and my favorite of all Law & Order Criminal Intent.  (I personally think that Vincent D'Onofrio is the VERY best actor on TV.  I'm a retired 25 year veteran Detective of a major U.S. city and he beats out Dennis Franz of NYPD Blue and Jerry Orbach of Law & Order as my favorite TV detective of all time.  But it's close!)

Lan & Order LA grabbed me from the very first episode and it never let go of me.  I'm a true Law & Order geek so when I heard that this show was coming on I was IN from the start.  But then I saw who was going to be in it and I was floored.  How they were able to assemble that cast is beyond me.  I just loved it.  (Except when they murdered Skeet's character!  It's only the second time in my life that I have ever cried over a TV character being killed off.  Robert Duvall's Augustus McCrae of Lonesome Dove being the other).

Why did they cancel this show?  There is SO MUCH GARBAGE on TV and they cancel THIS show?  NBC, or one of you other brave cable TV companies bring this series back.  And while you're at it, bring back Law & Order Criminal Intent would you please???",1350086400,26,1402,4.077205882352941
4580786,5,B0055SNHQG,"In a time when TV shows must either ""prove"" themselves in the ratings within the first few weeks of their airings, ""Law & Order: Los Angeles was not given a fair chance.  Competing in its time slot against CBS's highly-touted reboot of ""Hawaii Five-O,"" the show had its work cut out for it.  Considering the NBC didn't promote it like it should and then put it on hiatus for a while, made some cast changes, and seemed to put all its marketing on its reality programming, this Dick Wolf creation had an uphill battle.  Sadly, it didn't make it but it's still a worthy addition to the franchise.

The southern California setting provided a contrast in both content and appearance from the other shows in the franchise, set in New York.  The L & O: LA cast was very good, headed by Alfred Molina and Terrence Howard, more familiar for roles on the big screen than on television.  Although Skeet Ulrich only appeared in six episodes, he still made an impression, especially in his final episode.

Bringing in Alana da Garza from ""Law and Order"" early in the season was also a good move and occasional appearances from character actor Peter Coyote as the DA was also a plus.

The breakout star should have been Corey Stall, one half of the detective team that started with him paired with Ulrich and later with Molina. At times, Stall is like a younger, leaner, meaner Lennie Briscoe, the character associated with the legendary Jerry Orbach on the original ""L & O.""  Stall's ""Tomas 'TJ' Jaruszalski"" is sarcastic, witty, and can kick some major butt.  This viewer would have liked to have seen the show go on for at least one more year, just to see how this character developed.

The stories, like others in the franchise, were ripped from the headlines, with one obviously influenced by a certain golfer with a penchant for the ladies.

""Law & Order: Los Angeles"" is one cool show, befitting its location and should be savored for what it is and what it could have been.",1343865600,10,1968,4.607449856733524
4580787,3,B0055SNHQG,"I am one of the most avid lovers of Law and Order so I thought I would give this a try. I gave it a fair chance but in the end I must say, I'll just have to stick with the others. I see why it didn't last that long during its premiere season. I was totally shocked when they killed the most handsome character off in the first few shows... that was a heartbreak and I almost didn't watch the other shows. But I did and still wonder why. The switching up of the roles was odd and the plots were okay. In my opinion, it was not on L&O caliber. But oh well... it was worth a shot!",1343520000,,577,3.816666666666667
4580788,5,B0055SNHQG,"The stories were quite relevant to the LA scene and did not rely on Hollywood glitz. The show used the LA area locations well. The actors were good.

Skeet Ulrich as Det. Rex Winter was excellent as a reserved, thoughtful detective. His death scene was very touching. His partner's character was a little harder to read. The leitmotif of the partner seeking revenge for Winter's murder by going to Mexico on his own was intriguing.

Alfred Molina was a great addition to the cast. I wish we had the chance to see more of him.

It's been a year since LOLA was cancelled so perhaps it really is too, too late to protest in the hope that the show will be revived.

This show was murdered by NBC's programming people. They cancelled it even though the first episodes received good audience share. NBC did not give LOLA a chance to 'grow.' NBC blamed their decision on the time slot but they changed the night on which new episodes were broadcast thereby confusing loyal watchers then changed the cast and finally, the coup de grace, aired the episodes out of sequence.

4580792,2,B0055SNHQG,"I love the original Law & Order series; SVU; Criminal Intent; and new UK versions of the show. I think collectively they are the best crime shows on TV just due to their volume of episodes, the number of spin-off series that have also been very good, but mostly because of the consistency in the good writing in my view. So I very much wanted to like this new version of L&O but I didn't. This series can only be described as a 'mess' and here's why. The show starts off 'ok' with the typical half cops/half prosecuters format but with no familiar ""In the criminal justice system..."" lead in were familiar with. Skeet Ulrich as one half of the main cops who investigate crime I like--his partner less so. Ulrich is the best thing on the show until suddenly--he's killed off about 8 episodes in which lessens the show considerably. Albert Molina & Terrance Howard are the alternating DA's who handle the cases. So what's the 'mess'? After Ulrich dies Molina decides he's fed up being a prosecuter and goes back to being a Detective which we learn he was before becoming a DA. He is partnered with Cory Stoll, Skeet Ulrich's partner. Add to that the series intro changes completely at this time with the familiar voice intro added and Molina & Stoll featured rolling up on a crime scene . Are you still with me? Good because along about episode 14 comes 'the mess'; Skeet is suddenly back on the show, not dead, partnered with Stoll, the 'no intro' intro back and Albert Molina is back to being a DA. Say what? This isn't some ""he wasn't really dead"" plot thing, it appears the manufaturers got the episodes out of order. They obviously revamped the show including the introduction mid season but it didn't really work. The one good thing they did was feature Rachael Ticontin much more in the second half of the show.

Overall, the stories aren't bad and the familiar L&O formula is there in the show--Dick Wolf doesn't make 'junk'. But watch the first 6 episodes and you'll see why it was cancelled. If your a 'collector' of all the Law & Order shows like I am, your going to want this series. But if your not, and are just looking for a 'one season' Cop Show to purchase their are WAY better shows available out there like 'The Beast' with the now sadly departed Patrick Sweazy. That is a great show I really wanted to continue.",1322352000,13,2329,4.492924528301887

8458675,2,B0055SNHQG,"Although the individual episodes were all good - the sequencing of the episodes was ridiculous.  One of the main characters - a cop - is killed around the tenth episode.  In a subplot his partner goes after the guy that did it...but that subplot is never finished,  Then, about 6 episodes later the cop that was killed is, all of a sudden, is back in the show as if nothing ever happened.  This flip flopping is dumb at best.  As far as I'm concerned, it ruined the entire ""Complete Season"".  And, Wikipedia says there were 22 episodes - but there are 21 in the set.  Is one missing?  I love Law and Order - have from the start - but this LA version disappoints..",1518998400,,663,4.290322580645161

8458678,5,B0055SNHQG,"I loved this show.  The only problem I have is that in disc 3, one of the detectives is killed.  The ADA loses his job, and reverts back to being a detective.  However in disc 5 , the detective who died, is alive again and the ADA is back as an ADA.
quite confusing.  I suggest that disc 5 episodes are on the wrong disc.",1500681600,,321,3.8923076923076922
