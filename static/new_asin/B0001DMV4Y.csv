8010802,4,B0001DMV4Y,"As a retired law enforcement officer I cannot help but wonder if that 62 Plymouth patrol car had the police package with a 413 C.I. engine with two fours. Man was that a fast patrol car. As for the movie the acting was good, picture was good as was the sound. The plot, well I didn't like that part of the movie so much. The USA being hit by a missile and where from. The worse part all the good guys died from the bomb. None the less it is a good movie except for the end.",1413590400,2,473,3.88659793814433
8010803,3,B0001DMV4Y,"When the nukes are coming your way, the worst thing you can do is freak out or try to run.  That's what these folks finally discover.  Some really bad acting but sort of watchable.",1402099200,,180,4.264705882352941
8010804,1,B0001DMV4Y,"This is most definitely the kind of movie that should be shown on that Mystery Science tv show, or whatever it is called. I am talking about the show where they make fun of really awful movies. This movie is appalling stupid in EVERY way. A cop or highway patrol officer is stopping cars because missiles with nukes are flying towards what I guess is the United States. He stops five cars or so. The movie tries to focus on relationships between the really bad characters. A plan is put into action by the policeman where everyone will take shelter in the back of a truck trailer from an 18 wheeler. Later it is getting very hot in the trailer. People are shedding clothes, I think, I was fast forwarding. The cop graps someone's little dog and snaps his neck because the pooch was sucking up too much oxygen. Needless to say though the trailer could not be locked into a closed position from the inside, but whatever. Later when the cop is outside he beats on the trailer as if he has been locked out, which is impossible, at least it is if you could see the locking mechanism. The trailer locks ONLY from the outside. So the cop is fried in the nuclear blast and I guess the folks in the trailer rode the bomb out, or where the folks cooked to a crisp or vaporized. What is truely horrible about this movie is that the viewer is suppossed to take this plot seriously. What is nearly unbelievable is that the actors themselves could even go through this RETARDED script. This movie defies common sense. Perhaps when this movie was made folks new a whole lot less about nuclear bombs, but in this day and age this movie is entirely retarded. I have this movie as one of 200 other movies. I have no money tied up in this movie at all. I pity ANYONE who actually paid more than one dollar to see this movie. This movie insults any person with any intelligence. And the cop was always SHOUTING. Jeez, there isn't ONE character in this movie that is in any way endearing. This movie is entirely unwatchable, unless that is in case you simply want to ridicule every frame of the movie. In the latter case get a notebook ready to catalouge every retarded line and scenario.",1297814400,,2167,4.406483790523691
8010805,1,B0001DMV4Y,"It's difficult to describe how awful this movie is.

The ""plot"" concerns a group of people stopped at a roadblock prior to a nuclear attack. There are all kinds of characters- most of whom you have seen before- and there's even a crazed killer roaming about.

The photography is terrible, but it looks like they only had about three lights, the ""direction"" is kind of like ""you stand over here and rattle off these idiotic lines,and then we will cut to this other guy standing over here and he can rattle off his idiotic lines.""

The soundtrack music serves as perfect counterpoint to all this awfulness- tympanies and bongos offset flutes. Beethoven it's not.

After a while you WANT the bomb to arrive and put everyone- including you- out of your misery.

It appears that this movie was made to show how desperate people can be- particulary those with no talent.",1211241600,,864,4.695364238410596
8010806,2,B0001DMV4Y,"It might be the annoying characters, maybe it's the amatuerish acting, the paranoia of the previous generation might be the attraction or it might be the fact one of the characters in the film actually assualts a truck filled with chickens but I can't not watch this film.

I just wouldn't pay a lot to watch this film.",1194652800,2,319,4.5
8010807,1,B0001DMV4Y,"On a lonely road at 4 a.m., a police officer has set up a road block and is stopping cars from going any farther in either direction. He stops an old man and his granddaughter, a man driving an eighteen-wheeler and the hitchhiker he picked up, a rich boozy man and his girlfriend, a married couple and a man on a scooter. After getting messages over his radio, he tells everyone that the roads need to be clear because the cities were being evacuated because of an impending nuclear attack. The officer decides they will use the truck trailer as a bomb shelter. As they prepare, there are a lot of tensions among the people.

This is Not a Test is an awful movie for a lot of reasons. This movie appears to have been shot on a budget of about $13. No one here can act and there is certainly no direction being done. The movie is static and stifling because there is only one location. You never leave the lonely road for the entire film. The set up makes no sense. If the roadblock is being set up to keep the roads clear to evacuate the cities, why block traffic both ways? If cars are going to be coming from both directions, where are they going? And how exactly would the four cars the cop pulled over have clogged the roads? How is the truck trailer going to hold up to a nuclear blast? They ask the cop how long they will have to stay in the truck and he says about 2 weeks. 2 weeks? The half-life of plutonium is something like 5000 years. The granddaughter, for an unexplained reason, does not want to get in the truck so she, the guy on the scooter and grandpa run off down the road. Oh right, that's how you survive a nuclear explosion: you just outrun it. Eventually grandpa remembers a cave where the two young people can hide while he sacrifices himself to the bomb. Hey gramps, you couldn't of thought of the cave an hour ago while everyone was piling into a useless trailer? I could go on and on about the reasons this film is terrible, but I won't.",1190419200,2,1964,4.265415549597855
8010808,3,B0001DMV4Y,"""This Is Not A Test"" is a film that is pretty bad from several different points-of-view, including the writing and the majority of the stiff-as-a-board acting we find throughout the movie. But I find myself not really caring about the film's numerous deficiencies and am, instead, drawn to this movie like a moth toward a flame each time I start watching it.

The first scene in ""TINAT"" takes place at 4:01 AM one very late night, as Del Oro County Deputy Sheriff Dan Colter (played with an eternal rigidity by Seamon Glass) gets word on his two-way police radio that nuclear missiles have been launched toward targets in the United States, and Colter has been instructed to set up a roadblock to keep any cars from proceeding toward the nearest town, which is a prime target for the incoming bombs.

The entire 72-minute film takes place during this one single night, with the various occupants of the vehicles being stopped by Colter's roadblock ending up huddling together in the trailer of a semi-truck just before the bombs arrive.

Everything about this movie spells ""very low budget B flick"", but, as I mentioned, there's something oddly compelling about it. I can't quite put my finger on the exact reason why I like this film so much -- I just do.

Perhaps it's the all-nighttime black-and-white photography found in ""Test"" that attracts me to it. Or maybe the fact that it was made in the early '60s (1962), which is a favorite era of mine for movies. Or perhaps it's the doomsday subject matter.

There's definitely a certain gloomy and ""brooding"" atmosphere that has been created for the movie that comes through on the screen (even though it seems to be a quickly-made, slap-and-dash type of motion picture). I can feel the tense ""Bombs Are Coming"" mood that exists here. So, on that ""doom and gloom"" level, I'd have to say this movie was a success indeed.

The secondary plot of an escaped killer on the loose in the nearby woods doesn't ring entirely true....but at least the filmmakers did make an attempt at ""layering"" the script to some extent, which is a good thing in my opinion.

Being released in 1962 probably meant that this drive-in movie (despite its minimal production values) packed a pretty good punch with movie-goers who saw it back then, because near the end of that same calendar year America came closer to experiencing a nuclear war than at any other time in memory, with the Cuban Missile Crisis grabbing U.S. headlines for 13 terrifying days in October 1962.

I previously owned a copy of ""This Is Not A Test"" on VHS videotape, and was pleased to finally get a chance to upgrade the film to the digital format when it was released on DVD in March of 2004 by Alpha Video.

When I compared the DVD version to my VHS edition, I found that the two were relatively comparable in video quality. The DVD wins the ""PQ"" race by just a wee bit, however (which I was glad to see), but the video quality still isn't going to win any prizes for crystal-clear picture. But at least it's in watchable condition here.

The topic of video quality for a movie like this one could bring up the question of -- Does this B-grade film even deserve a grade-A DVD transfer? I'm going to stay out of trouble by not answering that loaded question, however, and just say that I'm satisfied with the somewhat-fuzzy ""drive-in"" look that the movie possesses on this Digital Video Disc. ;)

The DVD offers up the same Full-Frame (1.33:1) screen shape as the VHS tape, which is possibly the original ratio for this film. But I really don't have the foggiest idea whether this movie was filmed in a Widescreen format or not.

This Alpha single-sided DVD contains just the movie, divided into six chapters (there's a Scene Index available on the disc). There is also a ""Catalog"" Sub-Menu, with photos provided of other Alpha DVD titles. A large number of different products are displayed in this Catalog section too. I've never even heard of most of these films in the Alpha DVD archives, but some of them are familiar titles; and many of these DVDs have very well-designed cover art too.

There's a 24-page booklet included with this disc as well, which serves as a mini-catalog of other Alpha Video titles available on DVD.",1158969600,16,4228,4.674293405114401
8010809,4,B0001DMV4Y,"On a lonely stretch of highway, at 4 o'clock in the morning, a deputy sheriff (Seamon Glass) begins pulling over cars and trucks; and setting up a roadblock. Among the travelers are an old man (Thayer Roberts) and his granddaughter June (Aubrey Martin), two hustlers who've just struck it big (Mary Morlas and Mike Green), a truck driver and the hitch-hiker he's picked up (Alan Austin and Ron Starr), and a vacationing couple (Carol Kent and Norman Winston) who are in a hurry to catch a flight to Mexico. Sorry folks, not tonight! A yellow alert has been announced, and martial law declared. The missiles are only an hour away from the mainland. Our band of strangers must follow the deputy's instructions in order to... what?? Survive? Unfortunately, they are standing on ground zero! TINAT is a tale of fear, control, panic, and the ultimate futility of hope in the face of certain death. It is a horror movie with a mounting inescapable dread. The fact that the hitch-hiker in the truck is a serial killer on his way to watch his dad suffer an agonizing death is eclipsed to insignificance by the true ""monster"" of the story.  When the ""big one"" comes, of what use is law and order? Love? Money? Revenge? Anything? The only flicker of hope lies in two young people, whose futures are left unknown.
