8324378,5,B0001NXL3E,"Looking for a comprehensive intro to the sport of Drifting? This DVD has great racing scenes interspersed with driver interviews, info on the cars they drive, and a smattering of the history of the sport.
A word of caution: this DVD will make you want to buy a 1980's Corolla, soup the thing up like nobody's business, and start driving like a wild thing.",1083283200,2,355,4.5625
8324379,5,B0001NXL3E,"I can't believe it. An import car motor sport DVD that's really about import car motor sports. I've seen other DVDs on drifting and import car racing, but they're more into ""T&A"" than the actual sport.  Pure Drifting is like a real ""TV"" documentary that really tells all about the American drifting scene. The whole thing is great. The drifting shots, the interviews with drivers, everything is really well done.
This isn't a wannabe Fast & Furious/Girls Gone Wild thing, so if that's what you're looking for, this probably isn't for you. BUT, if you're really interested in drifting and what it's all about, this is it. Pure Drifting is great.",1083196800,5,644,4.801801801801802
8324380,2,B0001NXL3E,"I was pretty disappointed with this DVD.  All it tells you is HOW to get into drifting.  I just want to see some cool drifting clips, not be told every little thing that I have to do to be involved with it.  If there were less interviews and more drifting clips, it'd be alright, but I bought this particular DVD because of all the good reviews that it had here on Amazon, but once I watched it, I knew I had been let down.  After the fact, I have been told to stick with any ""Best Motoring"" DVD when it comes to drifting.  Just thought I'd pass on the message.",1081468800,,561,4.0636363636363635
