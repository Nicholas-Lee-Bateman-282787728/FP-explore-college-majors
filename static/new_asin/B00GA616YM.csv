6068284,5,B00GA616YM,"Love the workout, didn't expect a workout video to actually be difficult but do-able.  Some videos I've purchased before have been too easy or too difficult this one is perfect for me.  I'm 33 & a mother of a 3 year old boy.",1386460800,6,224,4.186046511627907
6068285,5,B00GA616YM,"This DVD is it! It had my abs on fire and I'm pretty fit but could definitely use some improvements. Evelyn did good with collaborating with Zuzka! It had me sweating and hit the all of the core and obliques. I will be doing this everyday. I think Evelyn is pregnant in the video because she is glowing and not her normal T.V size but I can say that she did good to be pregnant. Not only that, she has a nice figure still and curves. Thanks Evelyn! I love you!",1386288000,6,460,4.065934065934066

It was not to hard to keep up with, but still some of the exercises were very challenging.

6068296,5,B00GA616YM,"Video arrived in 3 days from purchase so I was very happy with that. I love this DVD!! Very simple yet complex enough to provide results for any body size. Zuzka talks you through each exercise and demonstrates how to do it. If you are lost, you surely have time to catch on to how you should be doing it. Evelyn is a more curvy woman, so it was really good to see the body differences on the video (Petite versus curvy) and the difference in workout postures. It is really encouraging no matter what size you are. This video is perfect for ordinary workout people. The video has 3 segments and they are around 15-20 minutes long. Great for a quick morning, before work workout or before bed stretch, or quick stress relief. Very down to earth and simple pace. All you need is one dumb bell and a mat. Works ABS, upper and lower back, and buttocks. Can't wait to see how much I tone up. You definitely feel the burn even though its very simple. Thanks Evelyn!!! I AM SOOO TEAM EV!! Can't wait for your next workout video!!!",1396656000,5,1023,4.333333333333333

8621555,5,B00GA616YM,I recently purchased this DVD in hopes of expanding my at home workout selection for those days I don't feel like going to the gym.

8621556,5,B00GA616YM,This is a great video with short ab workouts. Each workout is about 16 - 20 minutes and they are pretty low impact. This is a nice supplement to a longer workout or more like a cool down.,1424044800,,187,3.9473684210526314
