7869832,3,6304403313,"Quite an interesting episode, this, where the colonists on Moab IV have to decide whether to let outsiders into their perfect world or not. If they do, their safety from the disruption caused by a passing stellar fragment can be guaranteed. But if they don't, they'll have to just hope for the best.
""The Masterpiece Society"" presents an interesting dilemma and explores it from many angles, from those who would rather die than compromise their beliefs, to those who believe that change cannot be avoided. However, the romance angle with Troi leaves neither her nor Aaron Connor, the colony's leader, looking particularly admirable, even though it did provide a new angle on the core dilemma; and the acting from the guest stars leaves something to be desired.
I personally couldn't help but feel rather glad that the Masterpiece Society was disrupted - they are oh-so-superior in their attitudes. But that's not to say you don't feel for them as their world changes around them. And Geordi plays a more important role than usual, which is a plus.",1031616000,,1048,4.926553672316384
7869833,4,6304403313,"Mr. Bernabo's review (below) contains an excellent description of the episode. For my turn, I would like to offer the following comments:
The philosophical issues are impressively well-explored. Picard's strong point-of-view will surprise the many fans of this great series who are used to thinking that the writers are always too careful, except when they refer to things everybody is either for or against, like rape (as in ""Violations"", the episode that immediately precedes this one).
Geordi LaForge is the other regular character that is wonderfully used in the episode. Some of the dialogues between him and the colony's technology specialist remind us of Gene Roddenberry's best writing ever.
Deanna Troi's participation, however, is extremely weak. Her ""love affair"" with the colony's leader is much less believable than the often criticized relationship that develops between Kirk and 20th century's Edith Keeler (The Original Series' ""City on the Edge of Forever""). It is also unnecessary to the plot and it harms the storytelling.",996364800,4,1041,5.432098765432099
