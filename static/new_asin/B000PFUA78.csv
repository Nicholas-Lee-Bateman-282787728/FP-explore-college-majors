2818116,5,B000PFUA78,"Herculaneum, through history, has always been eclipsed by its fellow victim, Pompeii. Now, however, it is receiving the research and restoration that this city from the past deserves. The absence of bodies in the well-preserved town suggested that the citizens of Herculaneum had all escaped before the pyroclastic flow covered it over. In 1981, public works employees discovered a cache of skeletons in a boathouse outside the city proper. Sadly, it appeared that they had all been killed not by lava or ash, but by the intense heat the preceded the flow. Since that time, extensive research has been ongoing. This well-produced DVD tells the story of what has been found and deduced so far. Herculaneum is far better preserved, with many structures intact, than is Pompeii. Fascinating.",1212451200,19,788,5.1640625

8191072,3,B000PFUA78,"I found it focused a little too much on the gruesomeness of the Herculaneum catastrophe. I have seen other documentaries that covered the same ground but didn't sensationalize it as much. Even though I used to lecture on Pompeii and Herculaneum, I turned this one off after a few minutes and decided I really need to hear this again, not in this tone. Not for me.",1493596800,,363,4.515151515151516

8191076,3,B000PFUA78,"I've seen better documentaries, but I enjoyed this one.  Pompeii is quite well known, but it's sister site, 9 miles north up the coast towards Naples, is another, very similar and unique site of Herculaneum.  Yes, awkward name and surprisingly hard to find (I just visited in June 2014).  This documentary does describe the significant differences between the two disaster sites and the effects of the Mt Vesuvius eruption were very different.  Well done.",1406160000,2,455,5.108108108108108
8191077,2,B000PFUA78,"I hoped the video would show more about the reconstruction and explain more details. I also wanted to see something about how they restored the Philodemus papyri. Instead, it seemed to be an attempt at a sensationalized account of death at Pompeii and Herculaneum. I did learn some things, but it was not as informational as I thought it would be. I thought I would show it to my class, but I think it would be a waste of classtime.",1329523200,8,432,4.4125
8191078,5,B000PFUA78,Once again this DVD on Herculaneum is terrific and shows items of interest concerning our ancient history!,1288310400,2,106,5.294117647058823
8191079,5,B000PFUA78,"Although I bought this to supplement my Pompeii unit in my Latin 1 classes, I did not use it this year.  It goes into details about Herculaneum and the Villa of Papyri found there.  It also discusses the volcanic eruption of Vesusium in 79 AD and destruction of Pompeii in detail. Other materials in my classroom worked just as well as this DVD.
It arrived on time in excellent condition.",1243641600,7,388,4.5285714285714285
