8085782,5,B00083V9SG,"Robotech is the saga that introduced an entire generation of fans to the world of Japanese cartoons (anime). A unique merging of three totally unrelated shows into one epic story, the New Generation Saga is the third and final segment of the Robotech series (episodes 61-85). Originally called Genesis Climber Mospeada, it's a far more grounded and character-oriented saga than the first two chapters, but does a great job of moving the entire series to its earth-shattering conclusion at the end.",1193529600,,497,5.148148148148148
