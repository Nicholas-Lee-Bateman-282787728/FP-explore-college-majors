8696188,5,B00RWUOEOO,not much my favorite one Daniel Hugh Kelly in the movie - i bought it with that in mind - as a thriller good work,1487030400,,113,3.56
8696189,5,B00RWUOEOO,"The real treat here is Corri English and Tyler Mane. Corri English (Holliston tv series) does a fantastic job playing a blind character who works at a suicide hotline help center, and we get a fantastic performance from serial killer Tyler Mane as a caller whose darkness repeatedly takes him over the edge. Finally Tyler Mane plays a monster with depth, and a nice large speaking role, showing a bigger range of his acting than we've ever seen before. Kudos to the casting department and director!
In general though, if you like indie horror and a new take on a slasher film appeals to you, this is worth your purchase.",1465948800,,620,4.6454545454545455

8696191,5,B00RWUOEOO,Love this thriller!,1433808000,,19,5.666666666666667
8696192,4,B00RWUOEOO,"This film starts out like a standard horror story, but stay with it.  The ending might just startle you!  The acting is first rate, the atmosphere is appropriately creepy, and the production values are pretty darn good for a quickly made movie that didn't cost much. Van Hansis fans will love seeing our old favorite from his Luke and Noah days on As the World Turns.  We always knew he was a really good actor!  Be sure to watch all the way through the ending credits for another little surprise...",1429574400,,499,4.511111111111111
8696193,3,B00RWUOEOO,"This clautrophobic quasi-horror movie revolves around a suicide hot line call center for people with ""issues"". The main character is a young lady named ""Sam"" (when are writers going to get back to giving characters legitimate female names?) who has to deal with an obsessive caller with ""anger management problems"" among other things. When the caller accidentally discovers that our heroine (who also happens to be blind) is quitting her job he goes ballistic.  He is able to track down the location of the call center, drives there, waits outside the large office building where the call center is housed, kills one of the female employees who went outside for a smoke, steals her special entry card, and - voila! - he's inside ready to vent his wrath on anyone he encounters.  Mind you, there is no other apparent occupant of this entire huge building; there is no guard at a reception desk, the ""devil"" knows exactly where to go to disable the lighting in the space occupied by the call center, is able to dispatch the only guard (played by Daniel Hugh Kelly) in the entire building, knows exactly what floor to go to, and then we enter the world of ""Wait Until Dark"". Anymore to say would be a ""Spoiler"". On the positive side, fans of Traci Lords will be able to see her as one of the ""call receivers""; and for those who are a fan of the underrated and underused great Van Hansis of ""As the World Turns"", he is also present as a newbe call receiver. He turns out not to be a mere cipher.  A couple of items for any would be viewer and trivia minded individuals: 1) Keep watching this movie even after the credits end. 2) Van Hansis and Daniel Hugh Kelly were both in ""As the World Turns"" at the same time with Kelly playing the part of the disapproving father of Van Hansis's lover Jake Silbermann (the two played the roles of the first daytime openly gay couple).  VH and DHK are actually together in one scene of ""Devil May Call"".",1428364800,,1936,4.507122507122507
8696194,5,B00RWUOEOO,"In my opinion, it's a good thing that the DVD cover art for this movie is a bit misleading. DEVIL MAY CALL is not one of those supernatural movies about THE devil (which I generally find to be pretty lame). It's a more of a thriller with a psychokiller; sort of a cross between WAIT UNTIL DARK and MANIAC. The main character is a blind suicide hotline counselor, well-played by actress Corri English. She attracts the attention of an unhappy serial killer, who decides to pay a visit to Corri's office building after dispatching some other female victims he grabs off the street. He is played by Tyler Mane, the intimidatingly-huge former professional wrestler best known for his role as Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN. One of the co-workers at the suicide hotline center is played by Traci Lords, who has become a credible actress and still looks pretty darn good. DEVIL MAY CALL does not depend on a high gore factor like most other psychokiller films. That actually turns out to be refreshing. And, the end is satisfyingly fitting. Be sure to watch through the final credits for one last shot.",1426032000,6,1092,4.722513089005235
