Excellent story and well acted.

In Wernher von Braun: Crusader for Space, numerous statements by von Braun show he was aware of the conditions but felt completely unable to change them. A friend quotes von Braun speaking of a visit to Mittelwerk:

""It is hellish. My spontaneous reaction was to talk to one of the SS guards, only to be told with unmistakable harshness that I should mind my own business, or find myself in the same striped fatigues! ... I realized that any attempt of reasoning on humane grounds would be utterly futile.""

When asked if von Braun could have protested against the brutal treatment of the slave laborers, von Braun team member Konrad Dannenberg told The Huntsville Times, ""If he had done it, in my opinion, he would have been shot on the spot.""

Von Braun had been under SS surveillance since October 1943. A report stated that he and his colleagues Riedel and Grttrup were said to have expressed regret at an engineer's house one evening that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a ""defeatist"" attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments. Combined with Himmler's false charges that von Braun was a communist sympathizer and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, and considering that von Braun regularly piloted his government-provided airplane that might allow him to escape to England, this led to his arrest by the Gestapo.

The unsuspecting von Braun was detained on March 14th 1944, and was taken to a Gestapo cell in Stettin where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him.

Through the Abwehr in Berlin, Dornberger obtained von Braun's conditional release and Albert Speer, Reichsminister for Munitions and War Production, persuaded Hitler to reinstate von Braun so that the V-2 program could continue which in their view would be impossible without von Braun's leadership.

Von Braun took a very conservative approach to engineering, designing with ample safety factors and redundant structure. This became a point of contention with other engineers, who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized. As noted above, his excessive caution likely led to the U.S. losing the race to put a man into space with the Soviets. Krafft Ehricke likened von Braun's approach to building the Brooklyn Bridge.  Many at NASA headquarters jokingly referred to Marshall as the ""Chicago Bridge and Iron Works"", but acknowledged that the designs worked.

Many of Von Braun's characteristics are dramatically portrayed in this excellent movie.",1489449600,2,2731,5.022123893805309
8685134,1,B00OW7Z0ZM,"I Aim at the Stars, 1960 film

This movie presents a pretty picture of Wernher von Braun, a rocket scientist who was born in Germany and was technical director of V-weapons development for the Third Reich. He joined the Nazi party in 1937. He claimed the purpose of the rockets was to explore space, and not as a military weapon that destroyed people and property. But space travel is linked with military purposes. Von Braun received a Knights Cross award in December 1944. V-weapons were built in an underground factory near Nordhausen by malnourished prisoners from the Dora concentration camp. The book Operation Paperclip has more details on how Nazi scientists were brought to America with little publicity.",1423353600,,713,5.0423728813559325
