1359411,4,B00004W3H8,"When I originally bought the original Vestron video of Mutant many years ago, I thought I was in for some huge mutated monster movie due to the cover art (a beast head hovering over a town) and the title. This proves how misleading some incarnations of the cover art and title can be. To my surprise Mutant was a thinly disguised ""zombie"" movie and I will get into that more later. The title sequence is kinda of bad and I originally thought ""yep, I got exactly what I expected."" The film actually becomes a lot better as the movie trucks along. We start off with a killing and then delve into a story about two ""city boy"" brothers traveling along a remote southern highway where they run into some clich? rednecks who wreck their car. They are forced into going into a small town but the kicker is that toxic waste being illegally dumped near the town has turned many of the residents into mutated zombie like ghouls who start to feast on the blood of the remaining normal tenants of the town. Eventually it dwindles down to a few survivors (with Bo Hopkins playing an alcoholic run-down cop) having to escape the zombie-like hordes.

The idea of the mutant zombie creatures is actually interesting for this kind of film. The toxic waste changes the person's blood into a green/yellowish substance and swells. It swells to degree that their palms split. Through these splits the ""mutant zombies"" suck blood from victims like a leach. The make-up job on these ghouls is actually quit good and they have a nice terrifying appearance in dark corridors.

Not only are the ghouls impressive, but director John Cardos (Kingdom of the Spiders) is also able to make many great scenes of suspense. There are two terrific scenes with ""zombies"" attacking a women and a kid in a school bathroom and another when ""zombies"" surround a car and start burning through the glass to get to the person inside. I've been a horror film fan for years and nothing really makes me squirm, but there a a few number of scenes here that actually got me on the edge of my seat. He also moves the film along at nice pace and it builds and builds until the suspense filled climax. Nice job Cardos!

The acting here also brings this film up a couple of notches. Usually genre films like this have poor acting and actors that usually cause unintentional laughter. The cast here is very good lead by seasoned veterans Wings Hauser (Vice Squad) and Bo Hopkins. The supporting cast is also good and they all play the film seriously. There is a scene towards the end of the film where a female lead starts to lose emotional control and Hauser has to comfort her while being terrified himself. I really felt they were scared out-of-there minds. Thumbs up on the acting which is rare for this type of film.

The only really cheese thing is the story, which I know the story sounds like direct-to-video material. No doubt today it would be, but Mutant was made back in the early 80's and that was a great era because movies like mutant got a theatrical release and because of this, they a high-quality look them that director-to-video fodder sorely lack.

For horror fans looking for a nice mostly forgotten 80's horror film that actually has quality, then give Mutant a shot. It's got a great cast, good acting, nice effects, and some truly suspenseful moments. I was totally surprised by Mutant and liked it very much.

For some reason Mutant as been released in many different incarnations on DVD (4 that I know of). I originally bought the Diamond Entertainment version (It portrays the same cover art as the original Vestron video release)but its picture quality was no better than my VHS. By far the best edition available on DVD is the Elite Entertainment version sold here on Amazon. The picture is crystal clear (you can actually see what's happening in the dark scenes!)  and in anamorphic widescreen. A beautiful release of a rare film. If you want to own this film, you owe it to yourself to get the Elite Version!",1001548800,36,3987,4.622881355932203

1359434,3,B00004W3H8,"For a film I had never even heard of, this was actually a pleasant surprise.  Not something I'd need to own, but probably something I would watch again if it cropped up on late night cable.  Mutant falls somewhere in the family of Return of the Living Dead, it just lacks the humor.  But there is toxic waste, and some greenish ghouls (not vampires as described most places), that kill by touch.  Very similar to the 70s cheesefest The Children, with a slightly better budget.  The acting is on the upper end of the trashy horror scale, with a few recognizable faces.  This is a great film to add to a retro horror night as a little more obscure offering.",1470009600,2,655,4.416666666666667
1359435,3,B00004W3H8,"Shot in an off-budget Hollywood or TV movie style rather than the in-your-face independent horror aura I prefer, Mutant nonetheless delivers the R-rated horror goods fairly well. Emotional background musical cues and unnecessary and unbelievable love stories can be distracting for a horror fan like me, but I managed to overlook them here.  I saw this on video in the 80s and it made enough of an impression for me to rewatch it in the 2000s. Anything even somewhat resembling a zombie movie has potential interest for me, and Mutant fits the category better than some of the trendy ""zombie"" stuff that has become mainstream recently. It has nothing to do with sci-fi at all as two brothers on summer vacation run afoul of toxic-waste zombies and hostile locals  in a Southern town, while a sheriff with a drinking problem (the excellent Bo Hopkins) tries to figure things out. ""Mutant"" is the right word for what the toxic victims end up as, as long as you picture acid-burning, monster-like creatures in human form instead of space aliens. The suspense builds well if you can wait a while for the violent zombie action, and aggressive ""rednecks"" (heavily stereotyped, but still fun) pick up any slack in the meantime.  While there is no gore in the usual sense, the disturbing mutations and what they do to victims provide a ""gore"" of a different kind throughout. One scene of a female doctor reciting notes on the mutations while a colleague changes into a zombie behind her is particularly effective in a low-budget way.  While it sometimes seems hurriedly directed and is no masterpiece, I find this to be a fun watch and recommend it for fans of 80s horror.",1469232000,,1664,4.8076923076923075

1359439,4,B00004W3H8,"Mutant (originally titled Night Shadows) is a 1984 horror film about the people in a small community becoming `infected' when a toxic element is introduced into the local ecosystem.  Some of the townsfolk are stricken with a mysterious ailment, some are not.  Enter two brothers who immediately irritate the town bullies into a road rage car crash and a subsequent bar brawl.  What was supposed to be a life affirming trip devised by the older brother (Wings Hauser as Josh Cameron), soon turns into a `bloody' nightmare when younger brother Mike (played by Lee Montgomery, brother of actress Belinda Montgomery) goes missing.  What follows is a mad romp of near zombie perfection.  (Although the infected do turn into crazed zombie-like creatures, they only deprive the living of their blood.  Those they kill stay dead.)

Misleading title aside, this is enough of a horror flick to suit my needs in that area.  I liked the idea of faux-zombies, desperate for human blood, leaving a few scattered bodies in their wake of destruction.  The problem for them is so few of the remaining townsfolk are uninfected.  And with so many 'hands' to feed.................

Yes, it's a little creaky in the area of logic (or just plain common sense).  But it provides action enough to suit most.  True, I would have enjoyed any amount of gore but none was offered, more's the pity.  It does feature an incredible score by Richard Band.",1412899200,2,1423,4.899581589958159

1359441,1,B00004W3H8,"I love this movie, but this dvd is terrible. It is clearly a burned or bootleg copy. The night scenes are so dark you can barely see and the daytime scenes aren't much brighter.

1359442,4,B00004W3H8,"2 brothers on vacation start goofing around on the road which results in them nearly colliding with a bunch of rednecks in a truck. The rednecks turn their truck around and drive the brothers off the road and into a creak. With their car gone, the 2 brothers hitchhike to a nearby small town where they get into a brawl with the same rednecks that they encountered earlier. From this point on, the suspense begins to build and they later discover the dumping of toxic waste that's transforming people into zombie like mutants that suck blood from orifices on their palms.

This film isn't gory, and it has no nudity. The mutants don't really look like mutants and resemble zombies instead. The picture concentrates on a slow build, while providing good atmosphere and locations along with character development and suspense. It makes you wonder where the film is going and what's going to happen as things start to get worse, and the films effective locations provide nice scenery and atmosphere. I also thought it was well acted and very well directed. It's a really good flick to watch on a rainy day or late at night, but it's a slow moving film.

1359455,3,B00004W3H8,"Before buying this film, I could not understand why people were getting mixed up. I knew the cover had nothing to do with the movie as I owned this one time on VHS, but did not think it was a big deal. So one day I decided to see why they used this cover. While I do not know why Miracle Pictures would use cover art for a HORRIBLE 1982 Alien rip off film, that is what happened. I will explain:
This move has cover art that is for a entirely different movie -  a 1982 Roger Corman film called ""Forbidden World"" aka Mutant. This is NOT that film. LOL  But it is the SAME title.  This film is about two brothers who get into a fight with a bunch of rednecks and their car gets stranded in this small town. During their stay, one of the brothers goes missing, so the other sets out looking for him  While searching for his brother him and a local sheriff must defend themselves against killer zombie mutants that were mutated by toxic waste.

Why Miracle Pictures wants to confuse the public is beyond me. If you Google ""Mutant 1984""  you will see an entirely different poster for this movie. LOL  The film overall is low budget. It suffers from bad lighting, so be prepared for that.  I wanted this in my horror collection because it has that campy 80s style horror that collectors like myself enjoy.  The price is reasonable, and you could do a lot worse. Special effects are cheap but effective for a bit of a scare.  I have seen worse. Acting is not terrible and there is good suspense.

1359460,4,B00004W3H8,It took me awhile to find the good version of this movie.  That's the one from Elite Entertainment.  The other versions have prints that aren't very good. So ask before you buy. You only want the Elite version.  The Elite version has a good print and sound quality. This movie has some great acting from higher grade actors like Wings Hauser and Bo Hopkins.  Sure it's a b movie but it's a very good b movie. Made by seasoned filmmakers; This flick features chemically infected people who are dying but need blood to stay alive at all. They are not zombies but they do behave like mindless hungry infected people.  Like many movies of this type a small group of people try to survive in a isolated town against the menace at large. Cell phones were just not available much in the 80's due to their huge costs so this only leads to the feeling that you really had to go get help not call for it.  In the world of b movies you have studio quality films and those made way outside of those with true technical experience.  This is a upper b movie and was made and shown in theaters; not just in the now long gone midnight movie grindhouse circuit.  Those are cool movies too but this was better made than most of them.

1359474,4,B00004W3H8,"This timeless horror film stars two brothers who run afoul of some hicks on a country highway.  With their car stuck they need to hike into the nearest town to get a tow truck.  Upon arrival the town seems dead except for a dive bar.  Soon they discover a dead body alongside a building and go to the bar to make a phone call.  Well the hicks are at the bar and a fight breaks out.  Once the police are contacted, the boys don't have a whole lot of credibility especially when there turns out to be no body.

But there are strange things going on in town.  Lots of people are sick and only a handful seem to notice just how bad the situation is.  But it gets worse.  A blood disease seems to kill and spread, turning victims into hungry zombies afraid of the light.  They attack the living looking for blood.  Well, one of the brothers is missing while the other refuses to leave without finding him.  Thus we delve deeply into the horror brewing in the town.  The horror escalates until the surprising ending.

This is one of those movies where you have to wonder where it got its title. Mutant is a very inaccurate title.  But that aside, this is a good horror film that works.  Sure, some of the acting is not as good as it could be but it is good enough.  The zombie makeup is interesting and distinctive.  There is no mistaking these guys for the living/unaffected.  The horror is tied more into ecology than zombie pictures usually are but it was done well.  Once things really get going this film just does not let up.

And their abillity to melt things with their hands added some creepy moments to the film. The mutant transformations were spooky to. I like it when I see a movie that manages to create thrills and suspense without using buckeloads of gore. A lot of zombie movies tend to show a lot of guts beign torn out or necks chewed open. But this one has a more old-school feel to it and dosen't show to much graphic violence and tries to leave something for the viewers who can develop imaginations.

So, I consider it a decent movie with ok effects and good actors.",1161043200,4,713,4.281481481481482

1359477,3,B00004W3H8,"From co-producer Dick Clark (""American Bandstand"") and former stuntman turned director John 'Bud' Cardos (Kingdom of the Spiders, The Day Time Ended) comes Mutant (1984) aka Night Shadows, a film which executives and shareholders of the New Era Corporation ""Research Today for a Better Tomorrow"" didn't want you to see...starring in the movie is Wings Hauser (Vice Squad, Tales from the Hood) and Bo Hopkins (Tentacles, Midnight Express).  Also appearing is Jody Medford (Chained Heat), Lee Montgomery (The Million Dollar Duck, Ben), Marc Clement (Mississippi Burning, Chattahoochee), and Jennifer Warren (Slap Shot, Ice Castles).

As the film begins it's nighttime and we see a man walking about the grounds of a large house, collecting samples of a yellowish, mustard-like goo emanating from the ground.  After this, in a classic `what the hell were they thinking' moment, he enters the basement of the house through an external door and finds...something nasty.  The next day we see two brothers, Josh (Hauser) and Mike (Montgomery), driving down a country road, the pair heading to an unknown vacation destination.  After a fender bending run in with some local yokels in a pick-up truck, Josh ends up putting the car in a creek, and the two have to hoof it to a nearby town, which the reach by nightfall, just in time to find a dead guy whose face had seemingly been melted off.  They go to the only place open, a bar, get into a brouhaha with the same yokels as before, eventually broken up by Sheriff Will Stewart (Hopkins).  They report the dead body, but upon returning to where they found it (in a nearby alley), surprise, surprise it's gone...the sheriff hooks the two up with a place to stay for the night, and Josh wakes up the next day to discover his brother has gone missing.  Meanwhile, Dr. Myra Tate (Warren), the town's general practitioner, has noticed a severe drop off in her business, and those who do show up seem to be suffering from some weird, flu-like ailment.  Seems most of the town is down with the sickness, and subsequently the streets are deserted.  Josh, while searching for his brother, hooks up with Holly Pierce (Medford), a teacher at the local school, and the pair begin to notice things just ain't right...after a few bodies surface, Josh puts two and two together (to get five), and deduces a possible connection to the New Era Corporation, which purchased land in the area that included some abandoned mines.  While snooping around Josh discovers New Era is actually using the mines to dump toxic, chemical goo (talk about lack of corporate responsibility), which, in turn, is seeping into ground and turning the residents of nearby Goodland into mutants, favoring the darkness, feasting on the blood of the living through orifices in their hands, which also ooze burning, flesh eating secretions, strong enough to dissolve through metal...sound bad?  Well, it's about to get a whole lot worse as night is coming, and that when the creatures are most active...

Well, for an independently made film, Mutant was actually pretty decent, despite some obvious flaws.  The strengths include a relatively solid cast as both Hauser and Hopkins make good showings, along with a strong sense of forward movement in the story.  There's also a whole lot of character development, a good deal of which I actually found unnecessary and even awkward, but I think the latter was due more to how it was introduced rather than the fact it was included.  As the film progresses, we a number of minor vignettes between the principal players where some snippet of their background is chucked out there for the hell of it, in soap opera fashion, not really affecting the story much (the sheriff, who was at one point involved with Dr. Tate, has a drinking problem, and once was a big city cop before he shot a kid)...what's the point?  It's kind of hard to explain, but these various bits of background information didn't seem to emanate naturally from the story for me, but more so just dumped in my lap and created a sense of a whole lot of puzzle pieces that fit together, but not very well.  On the other hand, I did appreciate these attempts to try and develop a real story with lifelike characters, rather than just cranking out another run of the mill horror film.  Anyway, as I said, Hauser and Hopkins did pretty well, but I didn't think the same of Jody Medford.  Her performance didn't work that well half the time, but I don't want to be too harsh on her as this was only her second film.  As far as the hillbilly mutants go (some in nothing but coveralls), I thought they looked pretty effective.  The face makeup seemed a little over the top, especially around the eyes, but the notion of using gaping holes in the palms of their hands to actually feed on others was kind of cool.  There was little blood or gore, so if that's your bag, you'll probably be disappointed.  The parts I really liked were during the transformation sequences, as body parts would begin to pulsate and percolate, creating a real sense of nastiness.  As others have mentioned, there are a lot of similarities of this movie to any number of walking dead films out there, intensified by Cardos' predictable direction.  Don't get me wrong, predictable isn't bad, it's just...predictable.  Most all the scares in this feature are of the `pop out' kind, where it's obvious to the viewer that something is going to happen, and then sure enough, someone (or something) pops out of a closet or what not.  And I'll tell you what, the filmmakers certainly got their money's worth from whoever was working that fog machine during the night scenes...I guess it's better to have too much than too little.  I think my favorite scene was after Josh got caught snooping on the industrial site, witnessing the chemicals being dumped down the mine.  A subsequent fight scene has a number of workers accidentally being flipped down the same, giant hole they were dumping the toxic go-go juice, eliciting gruesome images of their most certain demise (if the fall don't kill `em, the goo surely will).  I also enjoyed the original musical scoring from Richard Band, who's worked on films like Re-Animator (1985), From Beyond (1986), and The Arrival (1990), but it did get repetitive at times as the same theme was played over and over again.

I've noticed there's more than one DVD release for this film, so I can only speak towards the quality of the Elite Entertainment DVD release, which was quite good.  The widescreen (1.85:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, is clean and clear.  One odd thing though, this is the first DVD where I actually had to change the settings on my player to get the film to play in widescreen format (prior to this, it came up in fullscreen format).  I'm usure the format of the audio, but it comes through very well and with no complaints.  As far as extras go, there really isn't anything, except for a theatrical trailer for the film.

Beyond that, the film is quite a grab-bag of genres (red-necks busting on strangers in town, house with a secret, town with a secret, sheriff (good guy or bad?), etc.  It's very similar in tone and action to Salem's Lot with a different underlying explanation. Make-up and gore effects are minimal but this fits in with the overall atmosphere.

1359480,3,B00004W3H8,"I really can't believe how much people liked this one.  The advertising made it seem like your typical Alien sci-fi/horror ripoff: ""Mankind's deadliest threat will not come from the skies"" plus there's the creature on the cover that does not vaguely resemble anything in the movie.  As a zombie movie, Mutant definitely rips off Night of the Living Dead more than any sci-fi film.  The story concerns two brothers who get stranded in a small Southern town.  The townspeople are acting strangely, it's half deserted, and it ends up being toxic waste dumping that's causing the problem.  Sound familiar?
I actually enjoyed the ""rednecks vs. the brothers"" parts more than the actual horror scenes for some reason.  Maybe because there was some humor in those scenes, I don't know.  I think it was also because so many of the ""scary"" scenes were shot in the dark, which was probably to cut costs and keep you from seeing the cheesiness of the makeup.  Plus the print itself looks pretty dark, which other reviewers have pointed out.  It's a less-than-great picture and the DVD has no real extras.

Not much gore here, a couple gross scenes with the people mutating but overall it was pretty tame.  The makeup on the zombies is standard corpse paint: most people could do as good a job for their average Halloween.  This no-frills approach to the zombies does make them look like the original (Night of the) Living Dead somewhat. Also there's a scene where they're trying to get into a boarded-up house that is a straight up Night ripoff: it shows the hands sticking through the holes in the boards and everything.  This movie could have been a lot better with just a few gore parts.  Even when the zombies get shot there is really no blood.
So if you really need to collect every horror film ever made (which at times I think I do ;), then by all means purchase Mutant.  At least I got it cheap; I laugh at anyone who would pay full price for this generic disc.  For what it's worth, you do get some cheap laughs with the rednecks and from some of the lines delivered by the completely untalented lead actress.",1078444800,8,2106,4.605898123324397
1359481,1,B00004W3H8,"I believe the other reviewer here is in error as to what film this is, but
he's sure got the rating correct.  I just watched this on an insomniac
night, 2:30 a.m. movie on a local station.  It has nothing to do with outer
space.
Regardless, it's abominably bad.  There are about three recognizable faces
here, with character actors in starring roles, including Bo Hopkins as the
(cliche) big city cop with a drinking problem who's surviving by working for
the sheriff's department after he shot a kid by mistake; Wings Hauser as the
(cliche) big city kid who takes his brother on a camping trip to forget a
girlfriend who just dumped him; and an actress whose face I know but whose
name escapes me, as the (cliche) small town doc who's losing business to the
new med center in the big town up the road a ways.
This flick is so predictable that you can already guess what happens when
Hauser and his little brother (we know they're brothers because they keep
saying so, although there's no sense of familiarity or ""inside jokes""
between them) rile up the local redneck of a small town on their trip, and
their car gets run off the road and they have to spend the night in a big
old house run by a middle-aged lady who's just not right.  We know one of
them will die, because see, we just saw a murder in this house and we know
she's not quite right.
In line with early-'80s chemical paranoia, it turns out some chemical from
the local ""No Trespassing"" chemical plant is turning the townspeople into
maniacs.  Beware, though; special effects budget appears to be approximately
what you spent on lunch.
Further cliches:  Hopkins puts up with the town redneck troublemaker and
just tells him to ""go on home,"" there's one beautiful girl in town who
naturally falls in love with Hauser, he and his brother find a corpse who
disappears when they get Hopkins to ""come see,"" the deputy sheriff chewing
Hopkins out for drinking on the job at the same time Hopkins has discovered
such a vanishing body himself, blah blah blah...",1050969600,,2017,4.542699724517906

This film may have had a solid premise (I say that for the mere reason that toxic waste in horror films usually make for the best monsters, such as the CHUD, toxic avenger,giant alligators, etcetera), but the pacing just about kills any forward momentum this movie might have had.

Let me tell you a story about Edward L. Montoro, the worst film producer in American movie history, and Mutants, the movie which  along with some heavy duty litigation and a nasty divorce  spared American audiences from any further entertainment on Montoros part.

The mystery of Edward Montoro is far more compelling than any of his movies. His company, Film Ventures International, cut its teeth in soft-core adult entertainment. Unsurprisingly, the first film *Getting Into Heaven* found a ravenous audience among smut-starved moviegoers in 1968, turning $13,000 budget into a profit over 20 times the expenditure. Thus emboldened, Montoro went onto expand FVI and produce such stinkers as Grizzly and The Day Of The Animals. The bald-faced Jaws ripoffs somehow kept FVI in the black, and apparently the public found no problem with derivative storytelling... but Montoro flew too close to the sun. Courts decided Great White, Montoros final Jaws derivation, was legally too close to Jaws, and yanked the film from theaters on its opening week.

To this day, nobody is sure what happened to Montoro. Things were looking bleak; with a divorce threatening to ruin his personal finances, and his final flop tanking in the box-office (and torpedoing FVI), Montoro embezzled a million dollars and disappeared. Most suspect he fled to Mexico; nobody knows if he survived the journey, or whether he lives today.

So what was that final turd Montoro foisted on American audiences? Mutant. What was it about? Goo-zombies, for lack of a better title. Imagine Day of the Dead and Deliverance had a lovechild, which grew up to disappoint both parents beyond their wildest fears, and thats Mutant.

And the real tragedy is that Mutant was, by far, the closest thing to watchable Montoro ever produced (besides maybe Getting Into Heaven; smut is smut and generally we aren't watching for character arcs or storyline, so I cant imagine he would have butchered it that bad).

The film opens as Josh and Mike (Wings Hauser and Lee Montgomery), two brothers from the city, motor down the highway in their fancy convertible. After a posse of oddly aggressive rednecks run them off the road, they're forced to walk into town. Conventional wisdom tells me this is yet another variant of the stranded in a cabin in the middle of nowhere horror trope, and Im not wrong. Within a few minutes of their wandering into the one-street podunk, its made abundantly clear that theyll be lucky to escape the town alive. Complications arise in quick succession: the same rednecks who ran them off the road ambush them in the towns one bar (and only open establishment), there isn't a gas-station or mechanic for miles, and within a few minutes Josh and Mike have already discovered the first body. By the time they get around to calling the cops  they stop for aforementioned bar-brawl, first  the body is already gone, but it kicks off the sluggish plot in typical Montoro fashion.

Enter the sheriff, Will Stewart, played by Bo Hopkins. Provided by Montoros crack writers with a passable backstory and suitably sheriff-y dialogue, Hopkins honest attempt at acting stands in stark contrast to the remaining cast. I assume everyone else said Screw it, its a Montoro film and phoned it in for principal photography. The astute sheriff, upon discovering some mysterious goo related to the murder, kicks off the sluggish plot and investigation after dropping Josh and Mike off at a not-so-subtly creepy old ladys house.

Josh promptly goes missing. Mike and the sheriff team up. Approximately ninety-seven pointless scenes later, Whoa! Goo zombies are running rampant in the town!

Our characters move from the inciting event. People die. Through building action and multiple complications, people die and reanimate. Onto the climax  did I mention that most of the characters exist for the sole purpose of dying?  and at long last, after ninety awful, unsparingly painful minutes, we get the resolution.

Roll credits. Contemplate your life. Ask yourself how your time came to be so valueless that you sat through Mutant of your own free will.

My usual complaints with Montoros films still stand in Mutant, his final gift-wrapped turd. Not a single woman in this film exists for any reason besides the principal three in shallow horror. Either they're hot eye-candy, or plot advancement tools used to create dangerous situations for the protagonist, or character advancement tools to be brutally murdered in order to motivate the hero. Sex appeal, tripping on their heels, getting eaten. Montoro, to his credit, never bothered masking this fact in any of his films. Audiences of the seventies and eighties, one must assume, weren't all that discerning. Modern moviegoers will likely be nothing short of insulted.

Was the cinematography good? The scoring, lighting, casting? Maybe the dialogue was decent? Surely something about this movie was redeemable, one may posit.

Sure. The makeup was pretty decent. They aimed for goo-zombies, and thats what they got.

Chances are Montoro never reached his destination when he fled. His movies don't strike me as particularly intelligent, and neither does the man himself. After Mutant flopped, he was probably thinking something similar himself.

I, having watched Grizzly, Day of the Animals, and Mutant, have now given Montoro and his films approximately five hours of my life which I shall never get back. So I like to tell myself Montoro perished alone in the Mexican desert with only his satchel of ill-earned cash to comfort him in his dying moments. But theres one other acceptable fate.

If Montoro  who would be in his eighties by now  is somewhere in hiding, reading these reviews, that would warm my heart.",1473120000,,5737,5.078723404255319
