8584095,4,6305827710,"Douglas Fairbanks (1883-1939) was one of the biggest stars in the early years of Hollywood, referred to as ""The King"" of Hollywood. Along with Chaplin, DW Griffith, and Fairbank's wife, Mary Pickford, he founded United Artists (1919). He founded the Motion Picture Academy (1927) and was its first President, was the first to put his hands and feet in the cement at Grauman's Chinese Theatre,  and hosted the first Oscar ceremony in 1929. He virtually invented the swashbuckler film and appeared in such classics as ""The Three Musketeers"" (1921), ""Robin Hood"" (1922), and ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1924). Here in 1920 is his first attempt at swashbuckling, and it's due to the tremendous success of this film that the others were made.

His co-stars are Noah Berry and Marguerite De La Motte, and we also have screen debut appearances by Noah Beery Jr. and Milton Berle as children.

Noah Beery Sr. (1882-1946) appeared in more than 200 films, mostly in the silent era, including ""The Squaw Man"" (1918), ""Beau Geste"" (1926), and ""The Rough Riders"" (1927). He made a successful transition to the talkies and appeared in westerns such as ""Riders of the Purple Sage"" (1931), and ""The Trail Beyond"" (1934) with John Wayne. Beery often worked with his brother Wallace, in films such as ""Stormswept"" (1923), ""Salute to the Marines"" (1943), and ""This Man's Navy"" (1945).

Beautiful Marguerite De La Motte (1902-1950) made her screen debut with Fairbanks in ""Arizona"" (1916) and often appeared opposite him. She worked primarily in the silent era and made more than 50 films.

The film is notable for the athleticism of Fairbanks. There are no stunt men nor any special effects. It's just Fairbanks. There is also a great deal of comedy, drawn no doubt from Fairbanks' previous roles which were largely comic in nature (e.g.,"" Headin' South"", ""Mystery of the Leaping Fish"", ""When the Clouds Roll By""). Burt Lancaster (1913-1994) is probably the only other actor to capture this blend of adventure, comedy, and athleticism. When ""The Mark of Zorro"" came out, 7-year old Lancaster spent an entire day in the theatre watching it, then spent weeks in his living room imitating Fairbanks.

There have been many screen Zorro characters since Fairbanks, the most memorable of whom are

* Tyronne Power in ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940)
* Guy Williams in the Disney TV series (1958)
* Alain Delon in ""Zorro"" (1975)
* George Hamilton in ""Zorro, the Gay Blade"" (1981)
* Antonio Banderas in ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998)

In addition to the films, Zorro appeared in several serials in the 30s and 40s, most notably ""Ghost of Zorro"" (1949) with Clayton Moore, who later went on to play ""The Lone Ranger"" (1949-57) on TV as a result of his role in the Zorro series.
Zorro's identity as the rich man with a secret crime fighting life was copied by characters like Batman, The Phantom, and Green Arrow. This theme can be found in the earlier Scarlet Pimpernel (1903) and many of the plot themes from the Pimpernel can be found in Zorro. Johnston McCulley, author of the novel that spawned the Zorro films, was familiar with the Scarlet Pimpernel and claimed to have been inspired by it.

Fairbanks continued making films into the sound era, as late as 1934 (""Private Life of Don Juan""), but his peak years were the mid 20s. You see him here at the height of his prowess.

Bottom line - a true classic from the 20s.",1289433600,,3381,4.803786574870912

Douglas Fairbanks, Senior, was one of the first true ""movie stars"" along with wife Mary Pickford and Fairbanks' close friend Charlie Chaplin. Only a bit dated by today's movie-making standards, this film would be worth watching if only for the elder Fairbanks incredible stunts. (In one scene, he leaps feet first under a hitching post and through a window, a stunt more suited to Spider-Man than this Californian crusader!) Zorro was also one of the first heroes with a secret identity, and one of the inspirations for Bob Kane and Bill Finger, creators of Batman!",1005696000,4,674,4.921052631578948
