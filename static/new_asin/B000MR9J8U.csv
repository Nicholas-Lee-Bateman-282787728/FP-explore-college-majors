8749298,5,B000MR9J8U,This video is really great for beginning endurance athletes.  I found it extremely helpful for my strength training days while I was training for my first marathon.  I am always looking for new ways to use the stability ball as well and this video provides some great ideas that produce results.,1187136000,,295,4.764705882352941
8749299,5,B000MR9J8U,This is one of the few DVDs that specifically speaks to the woman athlete. It is packed full of different exercises and guidelines for creating my own specific program.  No it is not your typical workout DVD where the Richard Simmons like instructor does twenty lunges and cheers you along. This DVD shows you the form of the best excersises done by serious women endurance athletes. I am a much stronger athlete since using the exercises taught on this DVD.,1180396800,3,458,4.725
8749300,1,B000MR9J8U,"If you are an endurance athlete like myself (I run ultra-marathons), then the information presented is not new.  I actually purchased this DVD thinking that it was more of a workout DVD, which I could use to augment my current training program.  But instead it's just a workout tutorial. (ie: How to do a squat..) It's very very basic information.. Most endurance athletes I know already have this information in their repetoire.  So save your $$$. (I wanted to give it 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me.)",1174521600,4,503,4.693181818181818
