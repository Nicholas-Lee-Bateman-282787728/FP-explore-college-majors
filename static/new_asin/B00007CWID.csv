8471504,5,B00007CWID,"This is definitely a movie that one needs to watch a couple of times in order to appreciate. It has an unusual plot that takes some time to grasp, complicated by poor cinematography and make-up (no doubt due to low budget), making the characters and the relations between them hardly recognizable. Despite all the insufficiencies stated this far, it is a beautiful movie, and the acting is impeccable! The story unfolds in a manner that is somewhere between poetic and hypnotic, and it is an accurate depiction of human conditions, that is, no matter who you are, everyone has the desire to love and to be loved. It's a movie that is worth many revisits.",1128470400,2,654,4.695652173913044

8471506,5,B00007CWID,It would require a better writer than I to do justice to this indie gem. But without question it's the kind of film u can fall in love with. I love this movie!,1036195200,2,159,3.8484848484848486
