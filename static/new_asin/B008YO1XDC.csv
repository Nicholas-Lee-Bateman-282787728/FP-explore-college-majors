5191200,5,B008YO1XDC,I wished it had English subtitles in this movie.  Other than that it looks like an awesome movie!  Can you help me look for it in English?,1377820800,,138,4.074074074074074
5191201,3,B008YO1XDC,"I was so looking forward to this movie and now i am vexed. I had no idea there was a freaking difference between a regular dvd and a blue ray dvd. I had no idea at the time of purchase and saw no other option until now. I still don't know the dang difference. I guess its time to read up on it. Like all products, i guess most things are being upgraded these days. Whatever!",1371772800,,374,3.9342105263157894
5191202,4,B008YO1XDC,"This movie was so cute if you can say that about a movie, Im hoping Nicole Beharie gets more roles and she is adorable she looks young even for 28. She will be starring in 42 about Jackie Robinson hope it does well for her. Good luck to you Nicole!!!!!!qh I can't forget the guy in this film Im not familar with him but he was good as well and so hamsome.",1358035200,5,355,3.9444444444444446

8532605,5,B008YO1XDC,"NOTE: This is the European version and won't play on US DVD players. Amazon is selling the US version as of November 18th, 2014. Here's my review...

Great film! A very believable and moving cross-cultural love story that pulled me in right away. Lead actress Nicole Beharie (""Sleepy Hollow,"" ""42,"" ""Shame"") is a rare and amazing talent. Here she not only brings her acting chops, but also her singing. The five songs she sings on camera blew me away. The other lead - German leading man/heartthrob Ken Duken (""Inglorious Bastards,"" ""Max Manus"") - also delivers a great performance. So do Reg E Cathey (""House of Cards"") and Marlene Forte in the other sweet love story. Finally, I found the limo driver, Laith Nakli (""Arranged""), added just the right amount of humor. See this film! Also, you may want to check out writer/director Stefan Schaefer's other great film ""Arranged.""",1414972800,,877,4.925675675675675
8532606,3,B008YO1XDC,I loved the movie. I hated the quality in which I got the movie. But again the movie itself it was great!,1414368000,,105,3.8181818181818183
8532607,1,B008YO1XDC,I got the German version of the movie My Last Day without You. Since I do not speak German I really did not enloy it.,1411776000,,117,3.72
8532608,4,B008YO1XDC,"**Thanks to a VOD that I saved--there is a Facebook page dedicated to the film that allows you to catch it when it airs-- I haven't had to encounter the same problems with German subs. **

Seriously, I have watched this movie over and over again, solidifying it as my favorite rom-com after ""When Harry Met Sally.""
Nicole Beharie (of ""Sleepy Hollow"" fame) plays an aspiring singer and Ken Duken (""Inglorious Bastards"") is a calculating executive of a big firm whose lives interconnect over the course of a day. The chemistry between Beharie and Duken seems to form genuinely and effortlessly and you will enjoy their back-and-forth dialogue and adorable facial cues. The rest of the cast is solid: Reg E. Cathey from ""The Corner"" and ""The Wire"", Marlene Forte who I instantly recognized but couldn't place from all of her TV roles, and Sharon Wilkins from ""Bad Boys II"" and ""I, Robot"". Also, the taxi driver in the film served as my comic relief (you'll love him).

One of the strongest point of this film for me comes from Beharie's singing. She has the voice of a neo-soul goddess and I am unashamed to say I became an even bigger fan of hers after watching this. I am also purchasing the soundtrack via Amazon as well.

Give this film a try. You will not be sorry. :)",1411603200,,1270,4.56140350877193
8532609,4,B008YO1XDC,Very good chemistry between the two lead actors. A very good romance story.,1410480000,,75,4.846153846153846
8532610,5,B008YO1XDC,"I fell in love with the movie, right along with the characters falling in love. I admit to being clueless at times...but I gained an entirely new appreciation for Miss Nicole's talent!...didn't know she could sing;)
THe story [based on the screenwriter's love @ first sight] and the director's protrayal of it is captivating.
I was leary of the $$, and a bit scared that the entire movie was in German. But thank God, that semester of German in college helped me to find the English button.

Loved it from beginning to end!!",1390608000,2,524,4.634408602150538
8532611,3,B008YO1XDC,If you are not literate in German it is difficult to find the selection to turn off the subtext when you select the English version. I haven't tried the German version yet to see if the subtext is left off. The actual movie is good and I would give it a higher rating if not for the clumsy Blue-ray clumsy content packaging by not providing both German and English instruction.,1390003200,,377,4.4
8532612,5,B008YO1XDC,"I absolutely love this film and have watched it numerous times (gonna watch it again after writing this review). Chance meeting set in New York (Brooklyn) between a German businessman and an American singer songwriter. What I love about this movie is that as an interracial couple the story does not give off the typical problems i.e racial issues that most interracial stories portray.
For those of you who are looking for a normal DVD (not bluray dvd) then you can purchase normal DVD via the German Amazon website. I live in the UK and got my copy from German Amazon. However keep in mind that we Europeans use REGION 2 DVD format so for US vierwers to watch dvd you need to purchase a multi-region DVD player!!

Also don't get put off by the title being in German. Nie mehr ohne dich in english means no more without you and the film can be watched with the actors speaking English (Ken Duken is German but Nicole Beharie doesn't speak German) or can be watched with German dubbing.

 In the dvd menu go to 'Einstellungen' then scroll down to English Dolby Digital 5.1, then go down to 'Untertitel' click 'Aus' and then 'Hauptmenu' (main menu) and then click Film Starten...

Then they speak in English!! :-)",1383177600,7,1212,4.597222222222222
8532613,4,B008YO1XDC,Anyone following the career of Nicole Beharie should get this little known film. Shows how she got to her current coveted status.,1378598400,2,129,4.909090909090909
