5927031,5,B00EL6NWWW,This is one of four concerts Joe recorded in London. Each one is different than the other. Each one is better than another only by your song preference. I would recommend this and the other concerts to any Bonamassa fan.,1388275200,,220,4.525
5927032,5,B00EL6NWWW,Looks like i'm going to have to get the other two shows what a talent and I will enjoy revisiting this and the other shows with friends who don't know about this powerhouse player.,1388016000,,180,4.323529411764706
5927033,5,B00EL6NWWW,Joe Bonamassa plays so many styles of music incredibly well. The set of Tour de Force DVD's is a perfect example of what Joe is and has been all about foe over a decade. If you are not a fan you will be after watching the set of 4.,1387497600,,231,3.7346938775510203
5927034,4,B00EL6NWWW,"I own the Tour de Force RAH show and really like it. I picked up the Shepherd Bush show because it is ALL BLUES and includes his horn section. I usually don't like horns but they add a great touch here. The sound of the guitar with horns is perfect - the audio mix overall is superb.

and, to be honest, I just gave this 4 stars because I figured you would read it. But, I really do own this disc and have watched it 3 times in a row. If you like Joe you will love this. I got it because I do NOT like horns usually - but I really like the horns in this show. If you are like me, then give this disc a view.

note: my name comes from an early Jimi Hendrix list on Yahoo. It was the Hey-Joe list and for awhile everyone who was seriously interested in Jimi was there - early days of the Net.",1385337600,2,790,3.8109756097560976
5927035,5,B00EL6NWWW,"This guy just may just very well be THE best R&B / Rock & Roll guitarist alive today. This is the ""Blues"" show of the 4 disc set. He plays some standards and some of his more well known stuff. The addition of the horns is great. Got to admit a few nit picks though. At first I thought the mix was going to be a bit off but it settled in real nice after song one when they brought the horns in. DTS HD is very good. And while still not quite up there with his Beacon show IMO its close. Real close. I guess my only other semi gripe would be this keyboard player is not on par with his past players. Something about using a stuffed animal to run across the keys that just doesn't quite cut it in my book. Pretty good directing too. Not much cut and pan. Good focus on the players. I would however take the director to task when it comes to close ups. Video really is good these days and I really don't need a close up of Joe's nostril hairs thank you very much! But again. Nit picking. Hard to find anything bad with this really.

All in all the playing is great. The band is tight. The sound and video are excellent. Get them all.",1385078400,,1129,3.995575221238938
5927036,5,B00EL6NWWW,"A bit more ambitiuous than the Borderline show, the brass section gave this oncert a bit of a different feel. Thoroughly enjoyable, Joe is as sharp as ever on the fretboard. Epic guitar solos rule the day, something I enjoy quite a bit.",1384905600,3,236,4.511627906976744
5927037,5,B00EL6NWWW,"In an unusual act of bravery, Joe Bonamassa headed for London in early 2013.  His goal was to play 4 nights, at 4 different venues, with 4 different set lists, and 4 different sets of musicians.  On his second night, March 27 he played the smallish Shepherd's Bush Empire theater and reverted to his rooted genre, blues-rock.

He has a nice mix of original material that he wrote alone or with others, along with some covers of blues greats like B. B. King and Willie Dixon.  For me things really got cranking with ""Chains & Things,"" ""Stop!"" and ""The Ballad of John Henry"" in the middle of the show.  His 6 man backing band included bass, drum, keys, trumpet, sax and trombone and the boys can cook.  As usual Bonamassa hauls out a handful of classic Gibson guitars as well as his own 2013 Candy Red makeover.

The concert is beautifully directed by Kevin Shirley and has a terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option.  The concert runs 104 minutes.  Extras include: No Man's Land:  A Behind The Scenes Look, The Making Of Tour de Force and All Access Pass which is a photo collection from Shepherd's Bush Empire.  This Blu ray disc is a must for fans or music lovers of any stripe.  Bonamassa is as good as it gets when it comes to playing a guitar.",1384300800,5,1246,4.440528634361233
5927038,5,B00EL6NWWW,"This is one of these rare perfect concerts; great sound, perfect delivery, tight musicianship, superb recording. For me, the best blues group around today. Not to be missed...",1383436800,5,175,5.285714285714286
5927039,5,B00EL6NWWW,"This, and the other DVD's in the Tour de Force set, encompass everything that those of us who enjoy concert DVD's have wished for and come to expect in this format.  Near reference quality sound; masterful video production (more on that later); and top quality performances by the parties involved.  Bonamassa and his bandmates are spot on in giving a heartfelt and engaging performance in all four of the concerts in this set.  Everyone seems to be having a great time and the interaction between band members comes off as very genuine during these shows.

Joe himself is exquisite and follows along his path of doing his very best every night.  One of the criticisms that I have heard about Joe from a guitar playing friend of mine is that he is so perfect - seemingly never missing a note or making an error.  Well, in my mind, that is a benefit to those of us who are fans of what he does.  You can expect a flawless, energetic, and emotional show from him every time he performs.  These concert performances demonstrate that in a huge way.

In regard to this show in particular, ""Blues Night,"" we find Joe with a 3 piece horn section, along with Carmine Rojas on bass, Tal Bergman on drums, Arlan Schierbaum on the keys, and of course Joe with his 5 different Gibson guitars and ever improving vocals.  Arguably the best blues/rock guitarist currently playing these days, he blisters his way through several classic blues numbers from his catalog.  Some highlights include a fabulous rendition of Gary Moore's Midnight Blues; An especially fine performance of So Many Roads; and a knock you out performance of The Ballad of John Henry.

A great deal of criticism often accompanies the video mastering of concert DVD's due to constant switching of cameras and camera angles - often with little regard to what me happening within a particular performance.  Such is not the case in this, or in any of the four concert DVD's in this set.  Proper attention is paid to guitar solos, impressive drum fills; and the rest of the performers, while keeping the main attention on Joe.  Crowd shots are kept to a minimum while we are treated to camera angles where they need to be when you want them to be there which adds to the feeling of bringing you into the show as if you had a front seat.  Basically, the camera is much like where you would be looking as if you were there in person.  Very well done.

The audio quality is superb.  You can choose between Dolby 2 Channel stereo; Dolby 5.1 surround sound; or DTS 5.1 Master Audio, which, if your system supports it, is the way you'll want to listen to these shows.  Of course, it sounds best loud, and the clarity will blow you away.

To sum up:  these DVD's are the new reference standard by which all who intend to make concert videos in the future should be watching before producing their own DVD's.  Simply outstanding in all areas, and of course the performances are simply ridiculously good.",1383350400,12,2946,4.601532567049809
5927040,5,B00EL6NWWW,"I'm putting basically the same review up for all 4 BR/DVDs and I hope you don't mind but they are consistently excellent and I'd be redundant anyway.

I just picked up all four BR sets and am so thrilled.  When I first saw these ""coming"" at my local record store (yes I'm lucky to have one near me Fingerprints in Long Beach CA) I thought, why bother putting out 4 videos from 4 shows on the same tour... and it struck me as overkill or as one review thought a runaway ego.  Yesterday I picked them all up and noted that they are 4 shows, 4 different bands, 4 venues and 4 concepts..

They are all great and for different reasons, but they all share things in common, great visuals, great sound, great playing and great value for money. All come with 28 page booklets full of excellent pictures and information and all come with bonus features about the shows that are consecutive in nature (4 part making of that is interesting and ads about an hour to each DVD/BR).

Favorite moments for me are Joe's treatment of the late Gary Moore's ""Midnight Blues"" both on his Blues night at Shepards Bush and his night at The Royal Albert Hall. Jeff Becks ""Spanish Boots"" played on a '59 Les Paul with Michael Rhodes on Bass and Anton Fig on Drums from the Trio/Borderline show is worth the price of the disc on its own! From the first show which features his TRIO days sound to the blues w/horns at Shepards Bush to the Rock show at Hammersmith and the final big night at the Royal Albert Hall these shows (ranging from 1 hour and 40 minutes to over 2 hours each) are wonderful expressions of a love of music by one of this generations greatest guitarists and for me to have this much classic Les Paul guitar playing is heaven.

I'd caution folks who think its too much, what would you give to have the same treatment by Gary Moore? Eric Clapton? heck...instead of highlights from the CREAM Reunion , what about a BR disc for every night? Complete? Would you want this from Peter Green at his best? Of course. I think that an artist like Joe Bonamassa who is certainly at a creative peak and has music and ideas flying off his fingers should capture as much of this as possible before he's too darned tired or burned out!!!

You can view each individual show to see if there is a song or set list that has more appeal to you. Personally I am in the mood for rock sometimes, blues with horns other times, trio work others, so I'll return to these depending and I'm glad I have all 4.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1383004800,22,2494,4.348387096774194

His brilliant delivery of guitar licks and smooth lyrics are all present in this concert blu-ray disc.  Call me naive, but I bought this as my first disc in the Tour de Force bunch simply due to the reviews and my trust in others paid off for me.  I'm impressed with each song and there is no other music format that beats DTS-HD Master audio, so the blu-ray is a must.

Joe is at his best playing the blues guitar and his voice just keeps getting better.  Two songs do not make a great CD, the rest of the songs are very good.
