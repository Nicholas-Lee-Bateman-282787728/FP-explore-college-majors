6199432,5,B00HR5A9MA,"This is a terrific generally lighthearted (though sometimes serious) romp about a mischievous Italian lover with a heart of gold. After the tour bus he is driving accidentally bumps into a beautiful French girl (for whom his eyes were ""wandering,"" since he is already engaged!), he feels a duty to take care of her and her two children, while trying to remain faithful to his fiance.

There's plenty of fun and laughs coupled with some tear-jerker moments, making for a really enjoyable film. And, YES, a great date movie, too!

Since there's a bit of salty language and a few slightly racy scenes, I would recommend ""Girl on a Bicycle"" for 16 and over.",1393286400,16,653,4.719298245614035
6199433,5,B00HR5A9MA,"Enchantingly sweet and funny movie.  And those child actors:  ""I'm six years old .  I'm five!"" will simply steal your hearts.  If you need/want to feel good, watch this movie.  You will NOT be disappointed.",1441584000,,206,4.771428571428571
6199434,5,B00HR5A9MA,"I absolutely LOVED this movie, but I wouldn't watch it with my mother.

An Italian Paris tour bus driver, has just proposed to his German  girlfriend of three years.
A French beauty stops next to his bus on her bicycle. things get complicated when he hits
her with the bus... gets fired because he [the bus driver]---following bad advice from his friend---
finds himself with a German fiance; a French wife; and two kids... it's TOO much to explain in
a short review.
I happen to HAVE a German wife; speak very little German... my mother's English... I
loved it!",1438819200,2,562,4.61

6199436,5,B00HR5A9MA,"I throughly enjoyed the goofyness of this movie, great fun. Folks looking for a prausible story watch pbs instead. What hollywood movie is shot in Paris with the main characters as Italian and German? and they both want the other to speak their own language in bed even though they can only communicate in English! I love Paolo doing the tour guide and ending his explanation, ""So what you gonna do?"" The kids are OK-cute, I've seen cuter, really. About Greta saying those kids look like genetically engineered, I don't think that's a good line for a German if you know anything about WWII. There is a very sweet singing scene at the end which I won't spoil it for you. All the time though I was noticing how unnaturally yellow Greta's hair is, I had the stereotype that all german women are natural blondes.",1424995200,,808,4.5793103448275865
6199437,5,B00HR5A9MA,"Completely charming movie.  Excellent casting and a very decent storyline.  I thought perhaps the multiple languages would be distracting, but that was not the case at all.

6199441,5,B00HR5A9MA,"This movie starts a little slow and is a little sappy in places, but it's really a very enjoyable and romantic movie.  Loved the ending.  One of the better movies I've seen in the past few years.",1421193600,2,195,4.243243243243243

6199443,5,B00HR5A9MA,"""Girl on a Bicycle"" is one of those romantic comedy of errors that is humorous without being silly, charming without being cutesy, and romantic without being sappy. The previous 5 star reviewers have pretty much written what this movie is about without spoiling it for anyone, so I'll not rehash the plot here. Even though this is a ""foreign flick,"" the few subtitles in German and French won't turn off those who hate to have to read what the characters are saying to each other because just about all of it is in English. The cast is made up of a German fight attendant, Greta, her Italian tour bus driver fianc, Paolo, the French girl on a bicycle of the title, Cecile, who happens to cause all of the plot's funny confusion, and Paolo's British co-worker pal, Derek. Each of them has something quirky about them and play off of each other in many ways, but manage to feel charmingly normal when interacting. O...and while there is brief nudity and salty language, neither is off-putting and does not detract from the feel good nature of this movie.

It is a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable movie that is perfect for two people sitting on a couch on a quiet date, or two people who have been married for quite a while, who just want to sit watch a good movie together.",1420329600,3,1277,4.552173913043478

6199446,5,B00HR5A9MA,"Mix one part Italian, a Brit, a German, two parts French, and a dash of young Australians, stir, and you have this wonderfully romantic European movie. What happens when your engaged, a beautiful girl smiles at you and keeps smiling at you, every time you see her on the street?  Infatuation, distraction, and obsession may follow.  That's the premise of this movie.  Oh, did I mention you accidentally run her over trying to get her phone number.  What follows is a madcap comedy of assumptions, misunderstandings and bad advice from best friends.  For Paolo (the Italian) with a German fiancee, that advice leads to a French ""wife,"" two young Aussies that call him ""Papa."" and a life turned upside-down.  The rest you must see for yourself and discover its conclusion.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have added it my DVD collection.  Just a note, unless you are multi-lingual, you should leave the subtitle option ""on"" as the various characters speak english, french. italian, and german throughout the movie.",1414108800,,1017,4.976331360946745
6199447,1,B00HR5A9MA,not my kind of movie.  waste of money for me.,1410220800,,45,3.5
6199448,5,B00HR5A9MA,"The first five minutes of this movie were a little lurchy and left me wondering if it would meet expectations as they give you a view of the two protagonists' lives separately before revealing their connection and direction. However, once the movie establishes its premise, you will fall in love and be conflicted all at the same time. This romantic comedy manages to be funny without being formulaic. It is ridiculously sweet without being saccharin.

THE PLOT (no spoilers): Paolo is a care free Italian working in Paris driving a tour bus and loves to explain to his patrons how every monument in Paris relates back to Romans or Italians in some way. He is about to propose to his girlfriend Greta of three years. Greta is a German flight attendant based out of Paris who can solve any problem with a little charm and very sharp wit, not to mention a little German efficiency. Honestly, she really reminded me of a German Amy Adams but a little less girl next door. When they are together, they both speak English since they don't speak each other's language. With a little more help from that German efficiency, Paolo accomplishes his task and manages the engagement. However as soon as that is accomplished, Cecile rides into Paolo's life on a bicycle and entrances him with a smile as she waits next to his bus at a traffic light. Chance turns into a daily thing and Paolo can't seem to rid his mind of the distraction. A series of events naturally brings the adorable but accident prone Cecile into Paolo's life and there the conflict really begins. Both of these women, and the actresses who played them, are so wonderful and so charming the viewer can't stand the idea of either getting hurt. They are both so perfect. Cecile also has two children that seem to think Paolo is their father (that's another story). They are so cute ""they could be genetically engineered"" as one character puts it. It's hard to explain how funny and wonderful this movie is without giving away some of the great moments in advance, so I won't say much more. It is unfortunate for those concerned about the R rating since they will likely skip this title. There were very brief moments of nudity from an angle and quickness that didn't really show much. Without those, I don't think there was much in this entire movie that could offend anyone.

It's a romantic comedy, so obviously this movie is not intended to be deep and it's just good fun.  Most of the movie is in English, though the first five minutes and a few other areas will have quick subtitles. I wouldn't say there are tremendous surprises, but this romantic comedy is not formulaic in any way and things will not likely turn out how you think at times. In addition to great situational comedy, this movie has tons of classic one-liners. I will also say, there is an airplane scene even funnier and sweeter than The Wedding Singer, though I would not equate the two movies at all. Guy or gal, I am 99.9% sure you are going to love this one. It's too bad the American audience is not that familiar with it yet!",1403395200,15,3061,4.5821167883211675

6199452,5,B00HR5A9MA,"There are so many reasons to like Girl on a Bicycle, whether it's the kind-hearted humor, the thoroughly likable actors, or the comical scenarios that bring the characters together. The movie had scenes that had me laughing so hard tears came to my eyes, and other times I was moved by the deeply emotional encounters among the characters. As a bonus, you get a trip to Paris that's a lot cheaper than a plane ticket. If you are looking for a light-hearted, fun movie, watch Girl on a Bicycle.",1398470400,5,493,4.550561797752809

8634672,5,B00HR5A9MA,"This is a rather unconventional love story.  In Paris, where people of many national backgrounds come to live, is an Italian man living with a German stewardess. The Italian, who has an English best friend, is planning to get married.  However, he is attracted to a beautiful girl on a bicycle. The girl is French and has two children whose father has gone back to his native Australia.  When the Italian driving a tour bus hits the girl on the bicycle, the story takes an interesting turn.  It is a wonderful comedy with an example of morality rarely seen in today's movies.",1441756800,,575,4.607843137254902
