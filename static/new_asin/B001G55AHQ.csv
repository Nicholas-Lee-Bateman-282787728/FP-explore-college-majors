8303831,5,B001G55AHQ,"though canadian made and starring the same actor whom did the short lived KCOP tv series is at best a ""decent"" robocop.

these films are pg-13 rated are fine for robocop completests.",1442275200,,182,4.6875

8303833,4,B001G55AHQ,"the videos were pretty much as I remembered them - that is, very good.  delivery and quality were as promised. my only complaint is that the dvds were not playable on my dvd player, presumably because the uk has a different standard than the united states.  since they were playable on my computer, this was only a minor glitch.  all the same, I wish I had had some warning.",1403481600,,374,4.391304347826087

8303837,1,B001G55AHQ,"I got this product from the seller after a little wait. The DVD is 0 region coding and it is PAL international video standard, not the NTSC american standard that the page says it is. I have to return it and not sure if I can get this in the NTSC standard. Beware Of this. The review had nothing to do with the actual program since I can't watch it.",1302739200,7,349,4.0
8303838,5,B001G55AHQ,"While a lot of the visuals and action sequences reflect its low budget, the story itself was quite good--even if the Legion virus seems far-fetched.  The acting displayed by Page Fletcher and Maurice Wint helped sell their portrayals of Robocop and his upgraded ""replacement.""  The only problem I can state is that Amazon has one bit of technical detail wrong.  This particular boxed set is actually programmed as Region 0, with PAL format, so my Blu Ray player won't play it.  However, if you have a DVD-ROM drive, it works just fine on a computer.  It's definitely worth buying if you are a fan of the original film.  It seems to ignore the second and third films.  Not that I mind, the third one wasn't very good.",1288656000,5,716,4.590551181102362
8303839,5,B001G55AHQ,"I originally purchased this DVD a couple of years ago and it was good enough that someone chose to steal it from my collection. It has a well written story that really explores the Robocop Universe with great detail and respect, the acting may not be ground breaking but its solid and easily draws you in. Must have for any fan of the franchise",1278720000,,344,4.390625
