3959810,4,B002NPCJV8,Nice documentary from a much simpler time when the enemy had a face and could be defeated.  Glad they made it home to their families.,1377302400,,133,4.32
3959811,4,B002NPCJV8,"Informative, with quite a lot of historical footage.  This was a great video and not overly long.  As a long time lover of the B-17 and specific interest in the Belle and her crew, I truly enjoyed this.",1370476800,,202,4.2894736842105265
3959812,4,B002NPCJV8,The memphis belle was here for a show and tour. Ater touring the plane we came home and rented it. We enjoyed it very much.,1366070400,,123,3.96
3959813,4,B002NPCJV8,"This movie is the true story of the Memphis Belle and not the Hollywood distorted and embellished version. If you're interested in the actual crew and their real life adventure, this is worth watching.",1363219200,2,201,4.9411764705882355
3959814,5,B002NPCJV8,"Good documentary about the B-17 and the men who flew them. It was a free offering, so I watched it.",1362355200,2,99,4.0
3959815,5,B002NPCJV8,"Great acting, great story, and great old planes.  I think this film did an excellent job portraying what it must have been like for many young men fighting in the largest air war in history.",1360454400,2,190,4.428571428571429
3959816,5,B002NPCJV8,"I have seen the Memphis Belle documentary more times than I can count over the past 50 years. I have seen the actual plane twice. I even have the nose art tattooed on my leg. With all of that I still found this product interesting. There was new footage that I had not seen and was not in the original documentary. The picture quality was first rate. If new to this story a person can learn the basic facts of this plane and her crew. Those of us who know the history will still enjoy this film. The crew who flew her have all passed on but the ""Memphis Belle"" and her story live on.",1349827200,15,583,4.078260869565217
3959817,5,B002NPCJV8,"I can't think why there haven't been any reviews of this programme before, because its a very special programme. It's not a re-issue of the old William Wyler movie, its a complete recut, twice as long as the original, using much more of Wyler's footage that was left on the cutting room floor. And instead of focusing on one raid, it tells the whole story of the building of the Mighty 8th Air Force, from scratch. If you're into WW2, it's great.",1269216000,9,446,4.451219512195122
3959818,5,B002NPCJV8,"A great movie!  Really enjoyed taking it to my 91 year old uncle to see with me as he re-lived his day's as a  tail gunner during WW2.  Those guys saved our country, and this movie shows it!",1472947200,,190,3.9473684210526314

3959821,5,B002NPCJV8,"Absolutely remarkable footage of the World War II conflict during which United States General, Ira Eaker built the largest overseas air force in U.S. history (based in England), also known as the Eighth U.S. Army Air Force. General Ira Clarence Eaker was second-in-command of the prospective Eighth Air Force, and was sent to England to form and organize its bomber command. Although his background was in single-engine fighter aircraft, Eaker became the architect of a strategic bombing force that ultimately numbered forty groups of 60 heavy bombers each, supported by a subordinate fighter command of 1,500 aircraft, most of which was in place by the time he relinquished command at the start of 1944.

Eaker then took overall command of four Allied air forces based in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, and by the end of World War II had been named Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces.

This program highlights one of the bombers used to defeat the Germans during World War II - The Memphis Belle, which flew 25 successful bombing missions over Europe. While 4,000 U.S. aircraft were thrown into battle, the Memphis Belle is celebrated as one of America's most prominent aircraft. Other B-17 bombers with names like, 'Dame Satan', 'Flying Fortress', and 'Stinky', also flew many successful missions, but none more successful than the 'Memphis Belle'.

The American B-17 bombers went through hell for the next three years until the P-51 'Mustang' aircraft arrived upon the scene. The P-51 'Mustang' was a long-range single seat fighter and fighter bomber which helped turn the tide of the war in Europe.

This program is so informative and is so chock-full of exquisite archival war footage that you want to watch it again and again! I have never seen such great film footage from the World War II conflict. Get this program - you will never regret it, and the world will always remember to never again wake the U.S. - 'The sleeping giant'.",1465084800,,1959,4.963414634146342

3959824,2,B002NPCJV8,"amazon screwed up my account.  I signed up, watched one video and then tried to log on from another computer in my home.  told me the information was incorrect, but it was.  said my zip code didn't match.

3959827,4,B002NPCJV8,It wasn't as dramatic as the the Hollywood version but it certainly wasn't meant to be. This provided some interesting background information and anyone interested in WWII and the air war should see this.,1454976000,,204,5.029411764705882
3959828,4,B002NPCJV8,"This was a good film. Even though I've seen other films and read about the Memphis Belle, this helped me learn even more.",1453680000,,121,4.304347826086956

3959830,5,B002NPCJV8,"Unlike any previous material about the Memphis Bell and the days of daylight bombing of Nazi controlled Europe, this story provides a behind the scenes documentary of the story of the Memphis Bell and it's importance to WWII America.  A captivating view.  It gives me a much better understanding of my father's experience in WWII as a radioman aboard the B-17 ""The Black Sheep"" of the 339th Bomb Squadron, 96th Bomb Group stationed at Sneath Heatherton Airfield, England, during WWII.  He was wounded in action on 8 July, 1944 and two weeks later  on July 20, 1944, the ""Black Sheep"" was shot down by German Fighters during a raid of a Meschersmitt Aircraft factory near Regensburg, Germany.",1448150400,3,691,4.880341880341881

3959834,5,B002NPCJV8,Very informative.  it was good.  Some of the footage is the same as other documentaries but it was still good.,1436918400,,110,4.45
3959835,4,B002NPCJV8,"In Part 1 the narrator several times refers to the ship landing at the Palm Beach Douglas factory where it is mobbed by factory workers. This is completely incorrect and due no doubt to confusion on the part of the British narrator and writers. The plant is the Long Beach, California Douglas aircraft factory. This is obvious by the backdrop of he adjacent Signal Hill covered with oil derricks. Another interesting thing about the film of the factory is the camouflage netting over the aircraft factory is visible in some of the shots.",1436572800,,537,4.78494623655914

3959840,3,B002NPCJV8,Good documentary detailing the desparation and danger of being in the air war in WWII.

3959844,5,B002NPCJV8,awesome real life story  and another great one is about a p39 I think that was trapped in Iceland I think sad story,1394668800,,115,4.0
3959845,4,B002NPCJV8,"Part 1 focuses on the story of the Memphis Belle and her crew. The original color footage is well presented and narrated. Too few ever achieved the required 25 bombing missions and the Memphis Belle was the first to return to the US after flying daylight bombing raids over German held territory from their British airfields.

Part 2  offers an overview of daylight bombing raids, aircraft involved and basic strategy. The specifications for US, British and German aircraft is presented in multiple original footage clips with accurate narration.

Recommended for both beginners and for those who are interested in the  history of US air power in WWII. Excellent footage and a 'must view!'",1382400000,4,689,5.070796460176991

8375278,2,B002NPCJV8,This is almost an exact replica of the DoD Memphis Belle movie.  There's a few more scenes but overall the same film and the narration is a reworded duplicate of the original.,1518739200,,175,4.46875

8375280,3,B002NPCJV8,"Most of this film is a rehash of promotional films (part 1 in its entirety seems to be a re-narrated WWII promotional reel for the Memphis Belle), most of the footage stock or relatively dull.  The narration is different (British, for one) and the perspective is too - that the 'Mighty 8th' 's daylight bombing strategy was largely a fool's errand (or a suicidal joust) until fighter escort could reach the bomber's range.  The cost to America for the 8th is the first I've seen, as well as the footage of the American factories welcoming the Memphis Belle.  So that stuff was new.  Footage of the bombing's results on the German people was included as an afterthought, mostly... The parts that struck me as new ****SPOILER ALERT**** was the sheer number of planes that were downed (supposedly the Ploesti raid dropped so many planes that you could basically navigate the entire path by burning allied bombers).  There was a bit more German perspective (they called the B17's ""fat busses""), some respect given to the German pilot's skills, more care taken with allied 'kill' shots.  So all in all it was interesting but not stunning, entertaining but not enthralling, informative but not revelatory.",1504396800,,1199,4.910891089108911

8375282,3,B002NPCJV8,"Engaging and informative and interesting, however it was hard to tell fact from myth as the film told a story that wasn't entirely true. That's not to say the truth is any less amazing, just that this film perpetuated some myths.",1485907200,,229,4.609756097560975
