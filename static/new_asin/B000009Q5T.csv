7905617,3,B000009Q5T,"TRAIL OF THE BROKEN BLADE is an early (1967) Hong Kong costume adventure starring Jimmy Wang Yu, who would become the Shaw Bros. studio's first real kung fu star (ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN, THE CHINESE BOXER). Here, the martial arts is predominantly swordplay and acrobatics, with characters doing lots of slashing sword thrusts and high leaps over rocks and walls. It's not as intense as the Japanese samurai films of the era, but is entertaining and very beautifully photographed on studio sets and outdoor locations (most likely Taiwan). There's a very strong romantic undercurrent involving Wang Yu's girlfriend determinedly pursuing him after he goes on the run. There's very nice music also. Wang Yu had started out as a swimming champ and is seen swimming to Flying Fish Island for the final showdown with the bad guys. This is not for hardcore action fans, but does represent one of the better films in Wang Yu's early career. It was directed by Chang Cheh, who became Shaw Bros.' leading kung fu director in the 1970s. This is worthy viewing for those interested in the roots of later HK kung fu/swordplay cinema. (NOTE: Since this review was done, the film has come out in a restored edition on Region 3 DVD from Hong Kong-based Celestial Pictures.)",982281600,4,1253,4.915094339622642
