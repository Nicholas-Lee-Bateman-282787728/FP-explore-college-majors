7957535,5,B00005YVW8,"I love this movie. The music is great, the acting is good, the Bigfoot costume is cheesy, you name it. Worth checking out for any Boggy Creek or Bigfoot fan!",1309305600,,157,4.266666666666667
7957536,3,B00005YVW8,"Although it has been years since I have seen the original release, I have recently seen the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of this movie. Of course this movie is a typical campy Bigfoot film and deserving of a MST3K treatment (which by the way was hilarious) it also stands alone as a good late night horror film if you have the right attitude going in. This movie like the original ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" is shot semi-documentary style following a University of Arkansas Professor and three of his students (which include two girls in unnecessarily revealing outfits) who set out to verify the exisistence of the creature by camping in the swamp. They set up their Apple II computer at base camp and watch pong like blips on the screen which track the monster's movements around their camp. They eventually have several run ins with the creature before pulling up stakes and going downstream to stay with a soggy bottom boy who is on intimate terms with bigfoot. The movie is also interspersed with the professor telling several legendary tales of creature sightings which of course are reinacted. All in all a good movie to watch before going camping and although it is kind of cheesy the premise still holds something that will scare the younger kids.",997660800,8,1263,4.798165137614679
