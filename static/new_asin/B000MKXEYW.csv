8169561,5,B000MKXEYW,"This DVD is filled with all the action and excitement of the 2002 World Series games.  The quality of the DVD is excellent; enjoyable to watch.  Any Anaheim Angels fan needs to watch this DVD.  Ordering was easy, arrival on time, safe, secure and with no concerns.  I would recommend Anaheim Angels Vintage World Series.",1409529600,,320,4.763636363636364
8169562,5,B000MKXEYW,"This Vintage film is exactly the same as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2002-World-Series-Video-Anaheim-Angels-vs-San-Francisco-Giants/dp/B000077VQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2002 World Series Video - Anaheim Angels vs. San Francisco Giants</a>&nbsp;DVD, which was originally released Nov 26, 2002 by MLB.  The only difference, it appears A&E subcontracted w/ MLB to re-package & re-release the product to appear different.  Worse, this Vintage film DVD does NOT contain the bonuses and extra features as the original MLB release.  So if you already have the original MLB version (which I do), don't waste your $ on this (which I did).  I rate 5 stars for content, but 1 star for A&E's disguise.

A better buy if you're a fan of L.A. baseball is Dodger's Vintage World Series DVD.  Likewise, it's the same content as the previous 1988 MLB release, BUT was previously ONLY on VHS.",1206576000,13,924,5.962121212121212
8169563,5,B000MKXEYW,"I am a Giants fan and this is the video to have if you want to relive the Giants' 2002 season. Although Game 6 of the World Series was a heartbreaking loss that lost the Series, this is a well-balanced video that follows both the Angels' and Giants' road to the fall classic in 2002. Starting with Barry Bonds' majestic home runs against the Dodgers in the season opening series, to the pickup of Kenny Lofton in midseason that gave the Giants a bona fide leadoff hitter, and ending with Bonds' monstrous postseason. The other video, ""2002 World Series Video"", focuses more on the Angels than the Giants and is 30 minutes shorter.",1204848000,2,630,4.584070796460177
8169564,4,B000MKXEYW,I only wish there was more of a history of the season. Worth the money. A great gift for true Angel fans.,1204502400,3,105,3.8181818181818183
