8545769,4,B009ZNUMV0,"Actually, I would go more towards 4.5 stars. This is a wonderful movie with lots of action that takes place over a bad 24 hours. What a terrific cast and what a wonderfully violent story. Nick Crawford is an ex-IRA agent who runs off to Los Angeles to start a new life. You have to be careful who you meet and befriend. he has to get his girlfriends brother out of trouble and what a rough night it is...did I mention that you just don't quit the IRA? Gangsters, IRA, drugs, guns.....we have it all. Loved it....not for the faint of heart.",1430179200,,539,4.294117647058823

8545771,4,B009ZNUMV0,"This is the story of Mickey O'Hara (Rick Crawford) who was and still is a member of the Provisional IRA. Only now that peace has gained a foothold in Northern Ireland he has to use his `freedom fighting skills' for other less meaningful work, like drug dealing and extortion. As a faithful foot soldier he is paired up with an incredibly nasty piece of work indeed - Mercer. They have been told to punish a mute lad who has stolen one of their cars that just happened to contain a load of nose candy. Mickey is all for retrieving the goods and giving him a slap on the wrists, only Mercer wants a more permanent outcome. In the ensuing scuffle Mickey shoots him; he now realises he is a dead man and so does a very quick runner indeed. He decides to head off to the land of the free, where everything has a price; and it is not too long before he will find out what he is going to have to pay.

He makes friends with small time player Jimmy, who unbeknownst to Mickey is in with some nasty drug types whom he owes a lot of money to. As Mickey has the hots for Jimmy's sister, Nina he decides to help him out. Only what he unleashes is a chain of violent events that will bring his erstwhile comrades in arms come looking for him, and they are not after a re-union.

This is a low budget film, but it still manages to be slick and even stylish in a down to earth, gritty way at times. The strength of the whole thing is in the actual story which will keep you guessing right up to the end, there is very little annoying sign posting, which I always appreciate. It does not try to be preachy either which is good when you consider the very subjective areas they are dealing with. Whilst the acting is not always top notch there are still solid performances and this never lets up on the action, so you get carried along. I found it to be visceral, often cool in a gangsta way and actually very entertaining, so if a bit of violence, thrills and a lot of anger action is your thing then you will probably enjoy.",1354406400,,2008,4.186046511627907
8545772,2,B009ZNUMV0,"This is an Irish crime story that takes place mostly in L.A. After trying to be a nice thug, Mickey (Rick Crawford) kills his partner in crime. Being wanted by Irish criminals, Mickey leaves to L.A. for the glamorous life as a bar tender. Nina (Kate Tomlinson) is a waitress and his girlfriend. Unfortunately Nina has a brother Jimmy (Collin Sutton) who is a user/drug dealer who owes the wrong people money.

Mickey agrees to help out Jimmy because Nina may be threatened. At this point the movie moves from bad to worse as a series of mistakes string together various clich lines  and a host of new unsavory characters.

Unless you like to hear the Irish accent, there is nothing to see here.

F-bomb, brief sex, no nudity.",1351814400,3,725,4.596899224806202
