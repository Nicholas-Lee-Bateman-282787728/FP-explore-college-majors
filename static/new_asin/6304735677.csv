930979,4,6304735677,"Interesting story of strong females in from the past. I thought the end was lacking in focus and did not end with mature storytelling. I felt the beginning did start with a solid, mature plot. The reality of stories of the past did shine through to make all who watch appreciate the efforts of those in the past to create a safe and (mostly) fair society.",1514937600,,355,4.393939393939394

930981,5,6304735677,"Most everything about this film : the cinematography, acting, directing, musical scoreand especially the screenwriting, is quite exceptional. Dana Delaney simply dominates the film as the fiercely determined, tough-as-nails Sarah, who will do whatever needs to be done in order to survive against both Mexican nationalists and Comanche in the inhospitable Texas brush country she is determined to call home...The young actress portraying Euphemia is truly gifted, and totally believable.....Although the second half of the film lags behind the first half in storyline, it is the writers of this unusual, female-centric film to whom major kudos should go out to; they have captured not only the languagebut imbued even the roughest characters with the dignity they deserved, imparting a heartfelt poetry to the words of men and women who risked it all to follow their dreams....Definitely worth seeingespecially for those interested in historically accurate depictions of the hardships faced by early settlers.....",1514419200,3,1013,5.671052631578948
930982,5,6304735677,I have never heard of this movie at all.  I am so glad that I did come across it on Prime Video.  I will most definitely find the book to read it and the dvd to watch it again.,1514073600,,176,3.4871794871794872

930984,2,6304735677,What is this supposed to be?  Plays out like a fairytale.  At 20:00 and injured soldier rides into camp to bring news of the deaths of husbands and sons and the women just let him lie on the ground suffering without lifting a hand to tend to his wounds?,1513468800,,253,4.142857142857143
930985,5,6304735677,"Love this mini series so much I had to buy it. there is no doubt that it will be watched over and over again. Dana Delany, the great (god rest his soul) Powers Boothe.. Their performances are so very powerful and touching that it takes you to the time of then Alamo and chasing Indians and racism literally and figuratively. I laughed I cried one of the best if not the best girl power westerns ever made.",1512864000,,405,4.2727272727272725
930986,5,6304735677,"I really enjoyed this movie. It captures the essence of the type of remarkably spirited women it took to midwife Texas in the harsh circumstances that sculpted them.  The portrait is honest and though the story may be fictionalized, the general circumstances are well-supported by historical accounts.  It is a fine and well-acted production with three strong and capable female leads. The landscape looks authentic.  Watching True Women is probably the most gentle introduction possible to understanding the early Texas woman archetype.  Until then, simple advice.  Don't cross them.",1512604800,3,584,5.51685393258427

931049,5,6304735677,"I saw this 1997 movie on TV years ago in debut,  but didn't realize this was the same movie at first as I didn't recognize the name.  I enjoy it a second time.  Texans have such a wonderful history so I enjoyed the plot.  All the actors were wonderful. The makeup artist transitioned them in age beautifully. I didn't know Angelina Jolie as a ""star"" in 1997, hence her small part.  I loved the music.  The filmography with horses, houses and all was  excellent.",1511740800,,461,4.416666666666667

931051,2,6304735677,"I expect to be lambasted for this review, so I'll offer some context for my point-of-view. As a kid of the '50's I loved all my cowboy TV shows, but each of the neighborhood dads (WWII vets) did this exact same thing: they all pointed out to us kids that the TV cowboys, using six-shooters, just shot 14x...without reloading. We'd all moan, telling the dads not to spoil our show. Then, when I, myself, returned from war (Vietnam), I saw some of the male cast on 'Happy Days' in military uniforms but with shaggy haircuts more true to their civilian counterparts than actual G.I.'s. What bothered me the most, and probably to the neighborhood dads of my youth, was how inexpensive it would have been to just be more accurate. What does a haircut cost when you have hair & make-up people on staff? Same with 'blanks' TV cowboys were shooting. If accuracy is not expensive, why not be accurate? The 2x I saw Dana Delaney swinging an ax, she looked to be exactly what she was - an actress who had put zero effort into mimicking the actual method and delivery of real-life chopping. She was simply not believable as a tough frontiers woman. Also, I've had to shoot rifles PLENTY of times when it was about life and death, and I know the scene in which she saves her sister from attack in the covered wagon by shooting the bad guy in the back from just a few feet behind - wasn't realistic...there was no need, with only seconds to react, to both shoulder and aim that flintlock rifle. From so close, anything in the general direction of his back would do the trick. The REAL concern should have been to not also take out her sister, who was immediately to the front of the guy...who was no real impediment to that racing bullet (ball). Better positioning of the camera & actors could have solved any concerns. Again, not much cost in order to be believable.

I gave two stars instead of one, because, while I bailed out after the 2nd chopping scene, I believe other reviewers when they say it was a good story. I'm in no position to claim otherwise. But for me, being sloppy on inexpensive technical issues stopped me cold. If I can't believe the scene, I can't get into the story.",1503878400,3,2177,4.469849246231155

If you need closed captioning, you can forget any DVD offered by them. That surprises me because they have a LOT of titles which interest me, being a combat veteran (9th Infantry Division, Vietnam). Apparently the added cost of CC is more important than making these products available to many of the people actually IN the programs. I think that is sad.",1473465600,2,528,4.688172043010753

It is history and excellent acting, deplicting both the sadness, happiness, hardships, and love of building a life while the state around you grows, too. I am a fan of old west history, and I love how the story shows the role women had - few people know that women were on equal footing as men when building this country in this part of the US. The actors are excellent choices for each role, and I also liked how discrimination is shown: it is not so easy to define, at times, nor it is so easy to see. My only complaint is there is not a Blu-Ray! And I would love to know about the true stories behind the stories.",1430438400,4,656,4.1328125

better, goes over so much more of the family timeline and is more true to the facts.
The movie seems to distort the facts to heighten interest and to fit the television
format.  The movie was good, but changing the facts seem to make it less than
accurate.  Reading the book gave so much of the back story that I think is necessary.
One good thing it does is that it does bring characters to life.  I think the casting
was very good as I had started the book first and was picturing characters much
like these.  Details like the river flowing in the wrong direction and Euphemia and
Georgia knowing each other as children, led to the confusion.",1360886400,3,722,4.325925925925926

It was depressing with no hope of a good ending right from the start. There was absolutely no plot whatsoever. The story just kept jumping back and forth between two families. It was disjointed and confusing. I never knew enough about any of the characters to care if they lived or died.

I couldn't tell you what the main idea or purpose was of this movie. I don't think there was one. Mostly just full of short portraits of racial prejudice, killing, and constant struggle just to survive. When the ""ending"" came, I was certain that my disc was skipping, so I rewinded it quite a bit. It turned out that my DVD wasn't broken or skipping. The movie just stopped at the dumbest place, and then the credits rolled. It's like the producer just ran out of money and quit shooting film.

China Beach's Dana Delany is Sarah, the family matriarch, whose little sister Euphemia (a delightful and empathetic Tina Majorino) has been living with her best friend, Georgia (beautiful Rachael Leigh Cook), and Georgia's parents (Michael York, Julie Carmen) on a large, bucolic Georgia plantation. After the sisters' father dies, Sarah's husband, upstanding Texas Ranger Bartlett (Powers Boothe), takes ""Pheemy"" down to Peach Tree, Texas, to live with him and Sarah.

Pheemy and Georgia begin a correspondence chronicling their divergent lives. As Pheemy and her family work their farm and battle Santa Ana and hostile Indians, indulged Georgia is coming to terms with her family's greatest secret: she is one-quarter Native American. Majorino and Cook are excellent in their demanding roles and offer a challenge for their adult counterparts (Annabeth Gish as Pheemy, Angelina Jolie as Georgia). This film, originally a TV miniseries, is an earnest attempt to depict the difficult--and often tragic--role women were compelled to endure during this historically rich but phenomenally difficult time. True Women has plenty of action, but relationships, politics, and grim reality are the true focus, as issues of sexuality, prejudice, human rights, and of course slavery are eagerly examined in the frontier setting. The sensitive should be forewarned: it seems like there is a death every five minutes. --N.F. Mendoza",1165363200,3,1517,5.567099567099567
932279,4,6304735677,"This is not a film for everyone. Although it can be considered a family film, the many scenes of violence (and a couple of sexual ones), make it viewing for a more mature audience. Recommended for ages 12 (14 for boys), and older. Descretion advised.

The overall production is superb. As is the acting. I watched all 3 hours of it, straight thru. It was entirely enthralling.

 Historically enlightening, the film shows how rugged the pioneer women of Texas were. They were more than tough, they were superwomen.

A sweeping epic that encompasses a generation of 3 Texas pioneer familes, it adeptly shows the inside look at the Muscogee Creek 'Trail of Tears' (from Georgia), the War with Mexico, the defense against vindictive Commanche, and the homefront battles during the Civil War. All from the women's perspective. Relating their sacrifices, friendships and family life, as they strive to survive some of the most grueling times, of the early years of Texas.

 Angelina Jolie and Annbeth Gish both show their broad range as actors, but i think it was the character of Dana Delaney that was the anchor of the film. Although she smokes a pipe like a man, she is reserved & resourceful...and although tender as a wife, mother and sister, yet she's as tough as nails when it comes to defending her loved-ones. Willing to sacrifice her own life in doing so. I loved that about her.

 This film accurately portrays what pioneers were really like. Real women and real men...they sure don't make 'em like that anymore.

This one is a must see!",1136160000,7,1542,4.788679245283019

932282,2,6304735677,"I felt the cast of this movie portrayed their characters quite well (if a little on the melodramatic side), however, I could not get past all the historical inaccuracies.  I am not a native Texan, but I know the history of this time period and this area well, and know that this movie takes quite a few liberties with how things actually happened.  I have not read the book and do not know if the inaccuracies were the film maker's attempt to make things more dramatic, or if the flawed portrayal of this time period is reflected in the novel as well (I hope not).  Historically inaccurate movies are always a disappointment because they misrepresent the events of their given day and time, and make people believe that this is how things actually took place.  Considering the stellar cast that was involved in this film, it is a shame that the story told was not the ""real thing"".  Perhaps, someday, they'll get it right.",1041292800,12,922,4.597560975609756
932354,3,6304735677,"Hallmark Entertainment offers a sweeping drama about the three women living in the South, from the time of ""Alamo"" to the Civil War.  I am afraid that your teacher of history cannot allow you to use this TV series as a text for American history, and that is simply because it is too melodramatic, in the fashion of that famous Margaret Michell's book.  The story is too fast; the characters are too many; but the film never stops, and something happens every ten minutes -- war, lynch, dead bodies (including children), commentary about slavery, rights for women to vote, human rights for native Americans.  In a sense, this is a modern version of ""Gone with the Wind"" with smaller scale.
Georgia and Euphemia are good friends, but the latter is forced to leave her in order to go to Texas (until then, it takes only ten minutes).  The film traces the life of the two women  separately until their reunion of many years later.  Now Georgia and Euphemia (with her independent sister) are both grown up, after the happy and sad times, and as you will expect, their environments changed what they once were; though they know they are no longer the best friends who played together by the peaceful riverside, they come to understand each other after the many plights of life in time of war.
There are so many events that happen every five minutes (as the editorial review say rightly) that it is impossible for me to summerize the whole story.  The film goes just like turning pages of paperbacks: now you see delightful scenes, and suddenly, a war or epidemic breaks out.  Now you see Georgia meets a man, and next, you see their pledge of love.  The film gives no time to think.  But that is probably the point.
So, it would be best for us to see the actors.  Angelina Jolie and Anabeth Gish are both good, and it is a bit surprise that their characters in childhood are played respectively by lovely Rachel Leigh Cook and Tina Majorino (who stole every scene from Kevin Costenr in ""Waterworld.""  Male character players like Powers Boothe and Tony Todd appear, alongside with Micheal York, but their roles are smaller they should be.  But it is a film about women, and female players all shine, of course, with Dana Delaney.
So, see this one as such, as a melodramatic rendition of the Southern history.  It is a laudable attempt to spotlight the women's roles in the Western genre, but perhaps the film gives you an impression that there is another way of describing it.  My honest feeling is that ""True Women"" works as a melodrama, and women's life of this time, which deserve our attention more, should be treated with deeper characters and a slower story.  Still intriguing.",1031616000,41,2676,4.649681528662421
932355,3,6304735677,"You know the story already, if only from a million predictable Hollywood films.  The message is that life is about struggle.  But in the case of Ms. Windle's book and this subsequent TV movie, the women of Texas are given a chance to share their point of view.  I teach Texas History here in the lone star state, and use clips from the film with my 7th graders.  It's hammy and overdone, clubs you with its message, and exaggerates relationships to tell the story of Texas.  My 12-year olds love it!  (This should be warning for all discriminating movie viewers)  I use it to show the woman's point of view in my class, and it's really one of the only films I can utilize in that respect.  It's fun to discuss the true story with the kids and then pop in True Women and see how they distort it!  The kids think it's a game to find all the inaccuracies.  Sam Houston burned down Gonzales, not Santa Anna.  San Jacinto was fought at 2pm and lasted 18 minutes, not ""all night long"" as the movie suggests.  There are no hills upon which to watch the battle; if you've ever been to the battlefield in Houston you know it's as flat as a table.  In all a fun and foolish film, but if it gets people interested in real Texas History, then so be it.  The Indians even speak with that ridiculous laconic English like in the old westerns!  Ex:  ""You brave squaw-child.""  I'm not kidding!  After you watch, read James Haley's ""Texas: from Frontier to Spindletop"" and get the scoop on our awesome history and our real TRUE WOMEN.",1015632000,22,1516,4.372759856630824

The performances were amongst the best ive seen and Angelina jolie never seems to fail.  She is my fave actress but the best stuff she has produced has never been seen over here so when i say how good she is people say shes only been in tombraider and gone in 60 seconds, my blood boils.
The movie had just about everything and its not my usual genre its kinda like bad girls meets little house on the prairie.  But each minute that went by kept me watching in anticipation until it all unfolded in tragedy and victory. A movie that will never be out of my collection, its brilliant and makes a refreshing change to some of the rubbish made these days through high budgets and no scripts.",1013990400,,853,4.253086419753086
932357,5,6304735677,"To think, I didn't even know this movie existed! If I hadn't been doing a search for movies with Tina Majorino (Corrinna, Corrinna) I would never have discovered it -- and yet here are three of my favorite women stars: Dana Delany, Tina Majorino, and Angelina Jolie, all together in one big beautiful package! And in my favorite genre, too! A family of women building the country together, facing hostile Indians, the question of slavery, the brutality of life in a time of hard work and multiple hardships. Women and children died more often than not, and survival is the key to success in those times. I loved the historic context, and the delicately drawn complexities of the issues, from Indians to slavery to war to suffrage. It's all in there. Why this movie got next to no publicity is beyond me.
What does puzzle me is the fabulous Indian ""Tarantula."" I don't know who played him. He's not listed on the box, nor in the credits -- none of the ""Indians"" are. He was magnificent. I would love to know who he was/is.
I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in the side of history we don't get enough of: ""herstory."" And of course, to fans of Angelina Jolie. She's as fabulous in this movie as she is in any of her others, and plays a role quite distinct from what you may be used to. Her character is complex, admirable, and made me think and question everything I thought I knew about Southern women. In fact, she brought a bit of ""Gone With the Wind"" to the role, without being too obvious about it.
Dana Delaney carries the movie from beginning to end and is as wonderful, believable, powerful and sexy as she is in China Beach. What a great movie! It's long, but not a moment is wasted and I had no trouble staying with it. You won't either.",1009843200,58,1767,4.45679012345679
932358,5,6304735677,"Though it's technically ""old"", this movie is a MUST-SEE!!!  It is about some very brave and determined women living in the mid to late 1800's, spanning the U.S. Mexican War, the Civil War, and various other predicaments of the time period.
The story traces the lives of two girls, Georgia and Euphemia, who are best friends.  Phemie's father has just died and she must go to Texas to live with her older sister Sarah, who is already a mother.  Phemie finds herself in the middle of the U.S. Mexican War and she watches in awe as her sister leads the women pioneers to safety while their men heroically defend their homes.  Georgia, back in Georgia :-), is experiencing some very horrific acts on prejudice.  She herself is part Native American so her family is in great danger.  The girls grow up in this young and troubled nation, and reunite to fight against the prejudice and other social issues.
This film is truly inspirational and has lots of action, so I think guys will enjoy it too!  ;-)  The cast includes Angelina Jolie and young Rachael Leigh Cook (the grown-up and little Georgias, respectively).

""True Women"", to me, shows that no matter the hardship and obsticles, there is always hope, if we have the courage to look for it. I think that Sarah shows us that all the way through the movie.  And Pheemy is absolutely wonderful in her portrayl of a young girl learning about life and then as a woman who knew what she wanted and went after it.  And what woman wouldn't want their own ""Barlette""! I have watched this movie over and over again and I still experience the same wonderful feelings of hope, love and strength that is written into every area of their lives.
