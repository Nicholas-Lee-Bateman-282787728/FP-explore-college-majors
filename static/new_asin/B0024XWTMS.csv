8350910,1,B0024XWTMS,"The author is obviously has is own agenda promoting fear mongoring a life with wolves in the midst. As usual, this type of narrow-mindedness junk projects little scientific, methodical research on the true, factual realities of having wolves do anything more damaging than balancing natural ecosystems. Granted, ranchers, who commonly graze their cattle, sheep at low or no cost fees want to continue accessing Fed, State, Public lands to make a profit on their livliehoods...however,  wolves do so much more to maintain health in nature all while exposing the biased, subjective author's initiative.....the only reason I gave it 1 star was because u cannot firward a review without at least that....",1522627200,,700,5.306306306306307
8350911,1,B0024XWTMS,"Don't waste your 9.95 on this pseudo-documentary.  The best comparison is that the ""research"" is equivalent to someone using tabloids to write a biography on a famous person.  Garbage.",1323820800,4,184,5.310344827586207
8350912,5,B0024XWTMS,"This documentary by Bruce Hemming gives a veyr watchable, biting, and very true story of the heartbreak of ranchers and citizens in the southwest due to the establishment of wolves in the area. Interviews with those involved are striking. Children are waiting for the school bus in wooden fortresses, and ranchers are losing cattle and other domestic animals. This is a view of New Mexico and the Southwest, we wish that now he would do the same concerning the wolf problems in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. This film should be a big warning for those considering introduction of wolves in other states. It's too late for Washington and Oregon, who right now are welcoming wolves. They ALL need to see this film.",1322611200,6,711,4.836065573770492
8350913,1,B0024XWTMS,I watched this DVD. How ridiculous! The author has absolutely no biological background in wolf biology. He is just spewing hate. Wolves are predators like any other- humans just slaughtered 45 millions turkeys this month for our Thanksgiving holiday.,1322265600,2,250,5.435897435897436
8350914,2,B0024XWTMS,"It is true that wolves can have a negative impact on ranchers who have to live with them.  In Wyoming there are programs in place which pay ranchers for cattle killed by wolves.  Perhaps the good folks of Arizona and New Mexico need to look into that.  It is working in Wyoming, and a program of fair compensation goes a long way to fix human/wolf relations.  As far as the hunters are concerned...  If you really suck so bad at hunting that you can't compete with the wolves, even with your 30/30 with scope, then perhaps you are a completely worthless human being and should try shooting fish in a barel.  Or perhaps just turn the 30/30 on yourself, whichever.  Bottom line, we need to find a way to live together, and propaganda films like this one don't help.  Just trying to further the cause of wolf extermination.  If all land animals that were potential pests were exterminated, we'd have nothing left but cows and chickens.  Some people would seem to prefer that.",1264204800,4,972,4.566473988439307
8350915,1,B0024XWTMS,"Hemming obviously has his own agenda - to instill fear about wolves. He is very selective in use of resources, takes information out of context and otherwise masks the truth. A quick search of the web will disprove most of what he has reported as ""fact"", including David Mech's study, human attacks and impact of wolves to deer and elk.

  The video is pure fiction and should not be categorized as a documentary.",1263081600,5,413,4.63013698630137
8350916,5,B0024XWTMS,"My parents ranch in the Methow, and my mom has taken to recommending this movie to those who don't understand why they're so worried about the wolf pack that recently appeared.

A major eye-opener-- I would highly recommend this to anyone who is trying to get a perspective from those who actually have to live around and deal with wolves.",1248566400,6,339,4.65
8350917,5,B0024XWTMS,"Bruce Hemming has produced a documentary of the problems of living with wolves. I purchased the movie a couple of months ago, and let me tell you, it is an eye opener. If you love hunting, if you are a Rancher, or spend any time outdoors, you must see this.  After you receive the video, be prepared to have your emotions explode. This is the real truth of living with wolves.",1239321600,7,376,4.295774647887324
