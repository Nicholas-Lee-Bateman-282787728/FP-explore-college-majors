778863,5,6304089767,Toy Story is one of my Top 3 films along with A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2. I can't believe Pixar/Disney hasn't released Toy Story on DVD yet. They would own Christmas if they did.,943660800,6,180,4.027777777777778

778987,5,6304089767,Growing up in the 90's and now having 4 kids of my own I have wanted to show them the wonderfully ancient world on the VHS. No movie was better to start with then Toy Story. I expected a grimy old vhs the may not work but boy I was so wrong!! The movie was still in its original case and in the original plastic! It played like a dream and everything was just how I remembered. My children watch it on a regular basis now and I love getting to share my old memories with them! This movie was a super great way for a blast to the past. The friendships created and the adventure in itself just makes Toy Story a forever favorite in my home!,1438819200,,638,3.9921875

779060,2,6304089767,"I had forgotten that Toy Story was even out when VHS was still around. I meant to order the DVD and ordered the VHS - not the seller's fault that I cannot read.

What does bother me is that it arrived behind schedule so that there was no time to re-order what I had actually intended to purchase for a nostalgic gift for a friend.

One star because it is useless to me, bumped to two because even with the shipping issue I should have paid more attention before I purchased it. And also because it is Toy Story and it is hard to hate... I did not contact the seller for a refund because it was my mistake in ordering it and honestly the hassle of a return for the cost of the item just did not make sense. Will probably end up being made into a purse.",1403395200,,751,4.033557046979865

779064,5,6304089767,"This movie is just alot of fun.  I'm not sure if I recommend it for very young children, as it has a lot of adult/young adult humor, and just from personal experience, when I was around 6 I had a big fear of toys and dolls coming to life, so this movie would have freaked me out.",1359936000,,279,3.8947368421052633

779149,5,6304089767,"I have to watch an animated movie a couple of times before I know if I like it.  I watched this one a couple of times with my grandson, who loves it, and I really like it too.  The characters are a lot of fun....my favorite if Rex and my grandson's is, of course, Buzz.  My grandson says a lot of ""to infinity and beyond"" and I love hearing him say it.  There's enough action to keep a soon to be 3 year old involved for the entire movie.  I had to order Toy Story 2 and can't wait for Toy Story 3 to be out next summer.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen along with the rest of the cast did an excellent job.  The computer animation is so much better than the older animations and I enjoy watching it.",1259798400,,692,3.9

779259,5,6304089767,"Reach For The Sky

""Toy Story"" is an excellent fun-filled adventure, for kids of all ages. I'd recommend ""Toy Story"" to anyone who enjoys animated movies.

""Toy Story"" is about a toy named Woody who gets replaced by a ""space ranger"" named Buzz Lightyear. Throughout the film they compete for their owner Andy's affection. It is a non-stop action packed adventure, with a thrilling climax. Toy story is a film I enjoy watching over and over agian.

Every family should own ""Toy Story"". If you haven't seen it you should check it out",1126396800,,531,4.688172043010753
779260,4,6304089767,"This was a good movie with very memorable characters.  The story talked about so many different subjects, especially friendship.  There were also little parts here and there that were quite entertaining.  The story seems original, and the animation is of good quality.  I found Sid to be a very interesting ""villain"" in this movie, being somewhat of a troubled kid with a love of destroying toys.

Overall, I'd say this is a fantastic family movie, and a good movie if you like Pixar animation, although it made me strangely gentle with my toys.",1098835200,3,545,4.817204301075269
779261,5,6304089767,I recieved my video 5 days after I placed my order but it would have been here sooner as there was a holiday. I am very pleased as is my 2 year old son. The tape was clean and played perfectly. I will order this way again and highly recommend this method to all my family and friends. Thank you very much.,1097539200,,305,3.935483870967742
779262,5,6304089767,"The toys are great, the graphics and scenery is too. The collectables are boys mostly but the film is ace for anyone.
