631835,2,6303336795,"This is definitely one of the strangest superhero movies I've ever seen.  Daryl (Damon Wayans) and Kevin (David Alan Grier) are two brothers who grew up watching ""Batman""...and nothing else except toilet humor is explored with that opening scene.

Kevin has grown up to be a writer for a crazed tabloid editor.  Daryl, on the other hand, is an inventor who, of course, has dozens of ridiculous gadgets that will somehow pay off...or will they?  Yes, his tools are creative, but they serve no purpose other than comic relief, which I didn't find funny except for Daryl's embarassment.

Sadly, the two brothers' grandmother is killed because she works for a City Mayor nominee who ticked off a cliche mobster (Jon Polito).  Daryl seeks revenge by dressing up in a ridiculous costume, and using those odd gadgets to fight crime and build a secret hideout (which I'm surprised nobody finds since it's at the end of a train track).  He dons the name ""Blankman""; how he gets this name is most amusing.

Let me make this clear - there are some hysterical moments in this movie.  The bickering between straight-laced Kevin and wannabe idealist Daryl is side-splitting.  In fact, just about every scene with these two together is very funny.  The problem with BLANKMAN is that its occasionally dark, dramatic tone doesn't fit.  For example, Blankman takes a reporter (Robin Givens) to his end-of-the-line hideout.  Now when these two have a quiet scene together, there's some strange music that reminds me of a despressed version of Danny Elfman's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS score.  Now take that unusual mood, and mix it with these comedic characters suddenly talking about the world and love.  BLANKMAN repeatedly loses momentum with awkward scenes like this.

There's another oddball moment when the Mayor is going to publicly open a bank and asks Blankman to be present for the dedication.  But then Polito's mobster and several thugs chain him up and set off a time-bomb that kills the Mayor, and possibly other people.  This Is Not Funny!  The movie is not trying to have a dark sense of humor at all, but instead goes for laughs that seem like they belong in DON'T BE A MENACE IN SOUTH CENTRAL...

The contrast of tones and themes don't work.  Another case in point, Blankman fights crime on his first night out and confronts a pimp slapping a woman around.  Kinda heavy stuff, but woman-beaters are easy to hate, so it's not too offensive.  But Blankman's genius idea is challenging the pimp to ""Slap me around and call me Susan!""  The scene is funny, if improbable...but seeing a woman slapped around and turned into comedic violence feels wrong to me.

Maybe I'm taking this movie too seriously.  But I can't understand why BLANKMAN didn't just stick to its strengths.  The movie is outrageously funny when it takes some jabs at classic superheroism (Daryl's inability to face life seriously instead of as a TV show is priceless).  Why does BLANKMAN have dramatic scenes that are not only misplaced, but also horribly filmed and acted.  After reflecting for a while after this flick ended, I concluded that BLANKMAN accidentally ended up trying to be a superhero comedy, an urban drama, and a hip-hop flick.  This movie isn't as bad as METEOR MAN or STEEL, but that's not exactly a compliment.

This film is directed by Mike Binder (THE UPSIDE OF ANGER, THE MIND OF A MARRIED MAN), who has a tendency to not establish clear boundaries for the worlds he creates.  BLANKMAN is another victim of Binder's lack of focus.  The movie has a serious case of split-personality with no hope of control.  I really want to like this because it made laugh hard a few times, but it strikes so many wrong notes that I can't quite recommend it.",1123632000,6,3722,4.800314465408805
631836,5,6303336795,"BlankMan is a laugh out loud riot for the entire family to enjoy. The film is about a nerdy African American, Daryl Walker, living in the New York area, suffers a tremendous tragedy when his grandmother is killed by a corrupt mafia leader; Michael Spinelli. Since then, inspired by the old Adam West T.V. show Batman series, Daryl dons the disquise of Blankman to fight crime to avenge her death. If you can imagine Steve Urkell from Family Matters pretending to be Batman, then you should have a good idea on who BlankMan is. The movie is simply hysterical and makes fun of all the typical super hero movie cliches. I loved how they used the old fighting sequences from the old Batman T.V. series to make fun of this genre. The movie will have you laughing histarically throughout the film with great scenes like when BlankMan confronts Spinelli or when David Allan Grier is talking to his crotch. Overall, this is a great comedy for the entire family.",1105142400,5,953,4.644970414201183

631950,4,6303336795,"I watched Mr. Wayons on ""IN LIVING COLOR"". There were many young actors/comedians and actresses-- that got their big break on this show. Names like Jim Carrey, ALL OF THE WAYONS CLAN, And it was hilarious. But I noticed that Mr. Wayons never allowed himself to be laughed at for being STUPID OR GOOFY. As a matter of fact, his Character ""Homey da Clown"" is a perfect example: Homey was not your average ..funny clown...he carried a sock around that looked like a weapon found in a correctional facility, A sock full of cokes or soap, made a great melee weapon. Luckily, Homey's sock was filled with powder. A sarcastic little bratt, would get a blast up side his head! Nope,  Homey don't play like dat!! And he would bash any obnoxious children a good KLUNK on the head. The younger Wayons were the exact opposite. Those guy's were CRAZY funny! They would do anything for a laugh.

So, you see why I was totally unprepared for the dignified actor/comedian to go all out on Blankman. it  was surprising. Wayons plays  a grown man, that never gave up on comic book heroes. He talked like a 11 year old. But he was a genius!! Unfortunately someone kills his mother. That was it!! Blankman was born. He used his intelligence to create numerous (super hero type stuff.
So, a normal, (mostly normal) Blankman hits the the streets to keep good people safe. Honestly, I was not crazy about this movie when it ran for the first time back in the eighties, . But in the light of this....angry world that we live in, makes this comedy/action, shows us ALL, that we need to work harder to make the world great again.",1478563200,,1603,4.517241379310345

632165,4,6303336795,"Two brothers. One a nerd. One a karate expert. Both grown up and living with their grandma.

Darryl and Kevin Walker (Damon Wayons and David Alan Grier) have lived in the rough part of town with their grandma since they were kids. As boys they'd run around the apartment with towels tied around their necks, aping Batman and Robin. Now, grown up, Kevin works at the TV station doing over-the-top news stories about aliens while Darryl works as a repairman and has a knack for inventing. After their grandma is killed along with several others while working to support the campaign of a wholesome, upcoming mayor, Darryl vows to make a difference in his city and invents bulletproof long johns, transforming himself into Blankman. He even makes a costume for his brother . . . who quickly refuses to join him. Taking cues from the campy 1960s Batman series, Blankman sets out to help others and uses this super alterego to work through his grandmother's death. Meanwhile, Kevin lets Darryl go about his crimefighting business since he's busy trying to woo beautiful reporter Kimberly Jonz (Robin Givens), who does real news stories several floors above him. Of course, tensions rise as Kimberly seems to have a thing for Blankman and admires the superhero's heroic efforts.

Eventually, Kevin learns who was behind their grandmother's death: the city's crime boss, Michael Minelli (Jon Polito). This time, Kevin asks to join Darryl on his crusade and since Darryl is the every-faithful brother, he produces the outfit Kevin rejected and Kevin becomes Other Guy, Blankman's side kick. The two take it upon themselves to hunt down Minelli and bring him to justice, making him pay for what he did once and for all.

Blankman is superhero comedy at its finest. It's also inspiring as it's the story of everyday guys trying to do the right thing even if it means putting on a costume and helping others. Damon Wayons and David Alan Grier are hilarious and the chemistry between the two works well. If you didn't know any better, would think they were brothers in real life.

This flick isn't your usual superhero spoof, though. It took itself seriously in that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek, but a deliberate superhero comedy with serious undertones. Everything from the social outcast that rises up, to the standing up for what's right in a world that's cynical and jaded, to going out of your way to helping your fellow man, Blankman hits it hard on all points.

The jokes and humor are laugh-out-loud funny, the sad moments make you ache inside, and David Alan Grier's facial expressions are priceless.

Like I mentioned in my review of The Phantom, sometimes it's nice to unplug and watch a superhero movie that's lighthearted, easygoing, and loads of fun.

There's plenty of action and excitement in this movie to satisfy those looking for those things, but it's real strength lies in its heart and that is about two boys rising up to become men in a world that took away the one person they held the most dear.

As a fair warning, this isn't a kid's movie as there's grown-up humor, innuendo and some language in it so is recommended for ages 14+.

I've been a Blankman fan from the beginning and though it's been nearly twenty years since it came out, I'm still rooting for a sequel.",1369180800,,3280,4.791150442477876

632212,5,6303336795,"I saw thiws film years ago and loved it. There are three Black Sci-Fi-Super Hero Movies that are much under appreciated and for some strange reason is never shown on TV. They are comedic Sci-Fi, ""Brother from Another Planet"" and Blankman. The third movie is ""Meteor Man"". It wasn't until recent years that there was a comic super hero movie that is in the same league as these, Woody Harrelson's ""Defendor""

I cannot recommend this DVD strongly enough. It is a real laugh. The three movies are not silly 10 to 13 year old boy movies, like ""Dumb & Dumber"", ""Pet Detective"", or anything Ashton Kutcher,  that pass for comedy today.

632218,5,6303336795,"Damon Wayans is Darryl Walker, a childlike inventor who is sick of the crime plaguing his neighborhood. When it takes the life of the grandmother who raised him and his brother Kevin (David Alan Grier), Darryl takes inspiration from their childhood hero, Batman, and becomes the most under-funded superhero ever, Blankman! Equipped with bulletproof underwear and a collection of odd inventions made from recycled junk,  Blankman takes a stand against crime and woos lovely reporter Kimberly Jonz (Robin Givens), Kevin soon joining up as his reluctant sidekick, Other Guy. Together, the pair does battle with the city's evil crime boss, Michael ""The Suit"" Minelli (Jon Polito). Jason Alexander co-stars as Kevin's seedy boss, Mr. Stone.

For anyone who grew up with the campy 1960's Batman as one of their big heroes, this movie is a must-see! Loaded with laughs, mostly thanks to goofy Darryl's attempts to be a superhero while screaming like a girl and working with no budget at all, this one's got some heart too. It's not a parody the likes of ""Superhero Movie"", and if you're going into it with that idea, you won't get it. It's a real superhero movie all its own. The cast is great, and this is Damon Wayans at his best. The DVD is nothing special but at least gives us a widescreen version that looks great (full-screen on the flipside), and it also comes with the trailer and trailers for ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" and  ""The Pest"". And if you like movies like ""Blankman"" and the ""Ace Ventura"" flicks, which really let those two ""In Living Color"" comedians (Damon Wayans and Jim Carrey) loose to do what they do best, I recommend John Leguizamo's ""The Pest"" as well. Unlike ""Blankman"", it's a terrible movie, but it's loads of fun!

If you enjoyed this review, watch my ""Moonlight Movie Show"" on YouTube, soon to return from hiatus with a classic horror-hosting format of feature films! And read the Moonlight Motel comic strip there too, also returning soon with all-new strips!",1217894400,,1990,4.844117647058823

A ""B movie"" for sure.
Young Damon Waynes is hilarious.
The sound track is early nineties and it's hilarious.
The characters and actors are great.

I know a lot of people will hate this movie but it's truly got a lot of finer qualities that can be overlooked by snobs.",1202428800,,292,4.407407407407407
632220,3,6303336795,"When watching this movie you have to get rid of all your brain cells for the moment and prepare yourself for a goofy ride through a geek's fantasy of becoming a superhero.

Kevin is the one brother who is heavily into reality with his job at HARD EDITION, a low-level journalist news station that makes up the news as it goes along.

Darryal, on the other hand, has not grown up at all and although he is brilliant in his own way he still has wild-eyed dreams of constantly inventing helpful things. Sadly, all of his inventions are either too good to be true or simply aren't interesting to the public eye. One day, (as in many superhero stories.) a subtle accident at his workplace involving a fly catcher that can fly around the room crashes a combination of chemicals onto darryal's lab coat. This makes the coat and anything that is mixed with the checmical impervious to bullets and knives.

True, there are many flaws with this picture. The story is somewhat tongue and cheek and there are some moments where the humor is corny and overdone but damon wayans plays such a believable geek that it is absoluetly hard not to enjoy watching him struggle to become a bumbling superhero of the streets.

Some of this movie pays homage to the 1960's version of batman and robin. There is also one scene where they mimic the arrival of a villian via an explosion underground which is a nod, or you may think of it as ripp off, to BATMAN RETURNS.

The one thing that I liked about this movie was that DAVID ALAN GRIER plays the perfect straight man to DAMON WAYANS' goofy persona.

The Adventures of BLANKMAN and THAT OTHER GUY is what this movie should have been called. But, all in all, the movie is not groundbreakingly good but it is not that bad. Give it a look.

Enjoy!",1143676800,,1772,4.46749226006192

7844605,4,6303336795,"This is a funny film. The movie is aimed at a young audience but much of the humor is adult. This film is important because it's one of the few films that feature an African American hero who fights crime in his community. The film has a pleasant mix of action, humor and romance. Robin Givens is beautiful and makes an attractive love interest. Wayans and Grier play off each other well. Blankman and Other Guy fight crime in the neighborhood. It's nice to see a film featuring a hero of color. Because of the nature of the humor perhaps only children seven and older should watch this film.
