8588919,5,B00D3D6KLE,"Highly offensive title and content. I would suggest the Maestra Josefina redesign the cover and cover comments.
Quite shocking in 2016 to see something like this on Amazon. It's pretty bad!!",1463875200,,190,5.161290322580645
8588920,5,B00D3D6KLE,"This is great! Almost as good as ""How to Train Your Wife Without Letting her Read"". After the delivery boy told my wife she had rights and she found some shoes and left, I thought I was done in! I figured an El Salvadoran was a safe bet since no one could talk to her-- even me. This closes the one loophole! Thanks Josefina!!",1450310400,,326,4.109375
8588921,5,B00D3D6KLE,"I am so thankful for this CD - now I can be offensive as a classist AND a racist all while having clean dishes and floors. Consuelo (That's what I call her anyway) has been so hard to train before this product. I had tried everything - cookies and extra pennies to even beatings - and now she cleans so fast you'd think I had TWO Mexican maids. This CD gives you spot on instructions such as ""how to use a belt effectively"" and ""water bottles filled with bleach as a deterrent""

Never mind all the ""human rights"" hoopla, If you have a Mexican maid that you paid hundreds of pesos for, this CD is for you.",1425945600,2,604,4.162393162393163
