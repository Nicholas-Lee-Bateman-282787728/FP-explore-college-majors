8058261,5,B00097FLEY,Excellent!,1430697600,,10,10.0
8058262,5,B00097FLEY,This was just hilarious and I laughed my butt off! It was priceless to see the wives reactions to their hubbys new looks. Terrific!,1422489600,,131,4.5
8058263,3,B00097FLEY,"I'm a big fan of the Fab Five, just sorry there's not many DVD's available. This one wasn't a disappointment, but I don't think it was hardly their best episode.
It was OK for a one-time viewing, but I'm not going to be bothered to keep it. I'll probably pass it on to the local LGBT charity's membership, for their DVD collection.",1420848000,,331,4.354838709677419
8058264,2,B00097FLEY,"I really liked the TV series, but this DVD has a lot of needless verbiage about gays that I found bordered on the vulgar.  Some of my friends are gay and they do not speak or behave that way.  Just not as good as the TV series. I would not buy it again.",1356048000,,253,3.7547169811320753
8058265,5,B00097FLEY,The Fab 5 defintiely picked a crowd pleaser in Kevin Millar and his World Champion companions! The kids are sweet and so deserving and the guys end up looking great. Too bad some of them don't maintain all of the techniques.......ahem Kevin! ahem....,1234915200,,250,4.837209302325581
8058266,5,B00097FLEY,"The Boys never fail to impress, even when it comes to 5 scruffy World Series champs!  If you love sports, but have reservations about learning anything from the Fabulous 5 - this DVD will combine the two in a virtually painless fashion, all the while teaching you how to enhance your life and beautify your surroundings!",1167955200,,320,4.714285714285714
8058267,1,B00097FLEY,"Unfurtunately, I can't watch this DVD, because of the ""wrong region""-code. As soon as I enter the DVD into the Player, this message pops up.",1128038400,,140,4.64
8058268,5,B00097FLEY,"This is my favorite Queer Eye video so far....it was SO much fun seeing them interact with the Boston Red Sox and poke fun at each other and themselves....even if you have never have seen QE, this episode gives you a real sense of each of the guys' personalities and it looked like they had a lot of fun filming it!",1126051200,2,315,4.180327868852459
8058269,5,B00097FLEY,"I've been a fan of Queer Eye from the beginning and I would have bought ANY and ALL of the episodes on DVD, but even if you're not a regular viewer of the Fab 5, you can't help but enjoy this DVD. The Red Sox and their wives were good sports and together with the Fab 5, they help out a Little League team and give them an experience they will remember forever. If ever there was a bridge between gay and straight, this episode exemplifies the significance of letting the next generation see that the most important thing is love.",1121212800,8,530,4.257425742574258
