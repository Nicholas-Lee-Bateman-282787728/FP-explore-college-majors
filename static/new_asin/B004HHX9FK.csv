4375709,3,B004HHX9FK,"Triple H makes his WWE Studios debut as he plays Ray Bradstone who used to be a wheel-man for a group of bank robbers led by a man named Larue (Kevin Corrigan) but was caught & served a prison sentence where he rehabilitated himself via advice from a radio show & knowledgeable books.  He gets released with the goal to leave his past behind him, including refusing to be acknowledged by his past nickname of ""Ray Ray"", & set things right with his daughter Sally (Ariel Winter) & ex-wife Lynne (Annabeth Gish).  After the difficulties of being an ex-con in the real world effected Ray as his family kept telling him that they've moved on while he couldn't find a job & lost everything he had in a fire, he agreed to do another job with his old crew but had a change of heart at the last minute & ditched the crew during the robbery and stowaway on his daughter's class trip to New Orleans.  When the Larue & the robbers discover that Ray left them & the police chase them, one of the robbers drop the bag of money next to the school bus Ray is on by accident & it gets loaded on the bus that Ray just happens to be on making Larue think that Ray set them up to take the fall while he gets away with the money.  So while Ray uses this trip to try to reconnect with his daughter, he has to deal with so many other issues such as the trip's supervisor Ms. Miller (Yeardley Smith), Larue on his tail, the police also looking for Ray assuming that he was was part of the robbery, and dealing with the kids on this trip from the ""spoiled"" Paris Hilton type to a ""brainiac"" to a prankster.

This was WWE Studios second attempt at a family comedy after Knucklehead with the difference here being that this was more humorous with the dialog more than just physical comedy.  One of the reviews for the movie stated that this movie is a modern day ""Kindergarten Cop"" which I have to agree with as it was a good overall family comedy that I enjoyed & would recommend for a viewing.",1301097600,5,1969,4.251336898395722
4375710,3,B004HHX9FK,"I went into this movie with low expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised by how entertaining it was. Triple H is very likable, and the story - while predictable - isn't half bad. If you're a WWE fan or you are just looking for a pretty good family action film, you could do far worse than this film. I recommend renting it.",1299888000,,327,4.290322580645161
4375711,4,B004HHX9FK,"The movie itself isn't bad, but the acting could have used some work. Paul was always good at memorizing his lines in WWE but wasn't the best at acting them out. I always felt Dustin Rhodes is WWE's best actor, but regardless, he did ok. Ariel Winters did a good job aswell. The start of the film is a tad confusing, because we don't know why he was in jail and how he got there, but that is explained (sort of) in the end.

Is it a family friendly movie? Well, that depends on what family you are showing it too. There is a little bit of violence and lots of guns. Kids with deadly weapon, kids driving a bus.....is it really possible to find the location of someones Iphone? That's not stalkerish at all is it? ha

I would still recommend the film, its worth viewing atleast once.",1299456000,5,782,4.241610738255034

If you enjoy WWE and Triple H, his character really sticks to you. He is a father trying to get reconnected to his daughter. Overall it is one of those average movies they have enough humor to it, in which you could watch over and over again.",1414195200,,313,3.9682539682539684

4375730,1,B004HHX9FK,"I was so surprised to see the extent of violence in this movie that is supposed to be a family movie. I think there is no such thing anymore. I purchased this as I have a 14 year old special needs son and it is hard to find any movies that are not violent or without language that he will imitate and yet also not too babyish. I thought from the other reviews this one might work but unfortunately not. It may have a good and positive ending, but in between there is bank robbery, guys getting beaten up and some, though granted mild bad language. Just be careful when thinking this is going to be a family film unless you have regular kids that can handle some non conforming elements.",1388793600,,686,4.244274809160306

4375744,5,B004HHX9FK,"Something that you wouldn't expect from HHH. This is definitely Paul Levesque. Funny movie, and along with Ariel Winter (Alex in Modern Family), this is a great pick if you want to see your favourite wrestlers in a role with more clothes on, talking in a normal volume and smiling. It certainly shows another side.",1367452800,,314,4.7272727272727275

4375751,2,B004HHX9FK,"What is it with Wrestlers and doing kids movies? Sometimes they work, but more often then not, they bomb. This one here stars Jean-Paul ""Triple-H"" Levisgue (however its spelled) who is just released from prison, and the first thing he does is asks a friend to drive... wait, wasn't that the exact same opening to The Games' other movie ""Inside Out""?, it's like Hunter must have it in his contract that he will not make a movie unless he is freshly released from prison, and drives a friends car once he's out? Anyway... The Cerebral Assassin's been on the inside and talking to some radio doctor and explaining to her that once he's out, he will get his wife and kid back in his life and a be a better man. But on release, his old buddy want's him to return to a life of crime, but the DX superstar wants no part of it, and to just go straight. After a bad first meeting with his ex-wife and daughter, ole' Big Nose rejoins his buds to rob a bank, but during the robbery Triple-Hemorrhoids decides to back out, and leave the guys in the bank to fend for themselves, while he walks off and hops on a school bus taking a trip to town, which his daughter is also a part of. Some mishaps happen, and the bank robbers figure the three H's had double-crossed them and kept the money for himself, all while trying to give the money back and just get on with his life, while his life is in threat of him being thrown back in jail, all because misfortune just seems to be raining ^%$# on him.

Overall, it's better then the god awful ""Inside Out"" that he made the same year as this. Still, it's not that great of a film, maybe worth watching once, but definitely not worthy of purchasing to watch again. Even DX fans, like myself, just don't care enough to pass this as a decent movie worthy of being watched more then once.",1329436800,,1815,4.291545189504373
4375762,5,B004HHX9FK,"I love Triple H so of course I enjoyed it. He did a great job in this movie and I look forward to seeing more from him! I've seen the Chaperone and Inside Out, they were both wonderful.",1328572800,,185,3.8947368421052633

4375764,4,B004HHX9FK,"THE CHAPERONE

I have honestly enjoyed every one of the WWE films productions thus far and I am happy to say I enjoyed this one as well. This one was the first one to star Triple H and over all it was good. This is a great one for kids as it has that classic family film vibe to it. This like other WWE movies suffered from the stigma that is wrestling attached to it. That really isn't fair because it stands well on its own, especially as a family comedy. Not a classic like some others in the genre but it is still a good film.

Ray Bradstone (Triple H) is fresh out of prison and is looking to reconnect with his daughter Sally (Ariel Winter). The only thing is his daughter wants nothing to do with him. She felt abandoned by him when he was sent away to prison after a failed robbery. Ray's former partners want him back in the gang as their get away driver. After a string of bad events he is lured back into that life. But at the last minute he bails on the plan and joins his daughter on their field trip. As luck would have it the robbers plant the bag of stolen money on the bus. Thus setting up a fun family ride as the robbers are on the chase, and Ray is trying to reconnect with his daughter.

I enjoyed this movie more so than I thought I was going to, my brother and I thought it was funny and good family flick. Triple H may have a way to go as far as an actor but he does a pretty good job here. You can tell he had a good time while making this movie and had a good time with his co stars. Speaking of co stars Ariel Winter was good as his daughter in this film and her behind the scenes stuff was really good. Also she can really sing and provides for the soundtrack. Kevin Corrigan and his partner in the film are funny as is Yeardley Smith and the guy trying to get with her. But of course the kids are the real stars of this along side Triple H and they all do a fine job here.

Written by first time screenwriter [it seems] S.J. Roth and directed by Stephen Herek [who has directed films you have seen] this actually tuned out to be a good flick. It is in that same vein of films like ""Kindergarten Cop"" and such. That seems to be the one every one compares this too, and it is in that same category. It has some good special features on it as well. Like a good commentary track with Triple H, Yeardley Smith, and Ariel Winter, full of some funny stories. There is also a lot of behind the scenes features and a music video from Ariel. Over all this was a good film from the WWE, while not the best it was still good. I would highly recommend this to any one looking for a good family film.",1322179200,,2615,4.0134357005758154
4375765,4,B004HHX9FK,"This was a pretty good movie. Lighthearted and definitely something for the family. Triple H does a good job here and so does the young actress who plays his daughter. All in all, a good film that is pretty funny and lighthearted. Check this one out.",1318550400,,250,4.456521739130435
4375766,4,B004HHX9FK,I know this isn't the best movie ever but it is a really cute movie. Plus I love me sum Triple H. He played a cool role. It was different from the wrestling role.,1317600000,,162,3.7941176470588234
4375767,5,B004HHX9FK,"I did not have a single problem in getting the merchandise ordered .. Amazon is the only logical place to order anything from as
they are ""secure"".  If a problem arises with anything ordered through them, it will be dealt with in a timely manner.  It's
wonderful when companies use Amazon to sell their wares because they have to live up to Amazon's standards.

I did not have any concerns .. the product arrived in grade A condition AND it arrived a little earlier than expected.",1313452800,,480,4.558139534883721
4375768,2,B004HHX9FK,"The Chaperone with WWE star Triple H, needs to rush to summer recess. The story line was boring. It is the same as any other starting out in prison. The daughter/ father  'I don't want you' line. Triple H, though a star in the squared ring, has only 1 facial expression that he looks like he is comfortable with, anger. Like many of the other WWE stars, few have been able to truly meld into the large screen with any grace other than that of a gorilla. My suggestion is for Triple H to keep is energy to wrestling.",1310860800,,515,4.202020202020202

4375771,4,B004HHX9FK,"I found Paul Levesque's film debut most entertaining. Okay, I had hoped Triple H and Shawn Michaels would do a buddy comedy a la DX, but this is an enjoyable family film. Ray's adversaries come off like rejects from World's Dumbest Criminals, and his relationship with Sally is fun to watch. The kids in the film were mostly excellent. The only parts I didn't get were that silly blonde with the overblown lips and Sally's mom's relationship with the doctor--it just seemed contrived. It wasn't necessary to the plot. The film could have stood without it.",1301702400,,555,4.791666666666667
