1935037,5,B0000E32X3,"When this show premiered, I lived in Seattle, and the local hype was just too much. I never watched, because I couldn't believe a show with the psychiatrist from ""Cheers"" could ever work. Cheers was the greatest, so this had to be inferior! So I thought. This show is the greatest that has ever been. Rich, developed characters, believable and hilarious episodes, and premises. So extremely imaginative and of top quality always. As a writer, I am so jealous of this program and will miss it when it leaves the air. I bought the first and will buy this one. You should too! It's great!",1073260800,7,585,4.580952380952381
1935038,5,B0000E32X3,"Well, YOU should all check your local stores for this thing cause I managed to pick it up a week early.  It was mis marked and dated for Sept 3rd!  They actually rang it up and off I went out the door grinning ear to ear.  There it was on top of a box of unstocked movies just screaming for me to grab it and throw it into my cart.
The second season is excellent.  Frasier is one of the best written comedy series on TV.  ""Matchmaker"" is a classic episode and is included here.  ""If this were a real emergency, your radio would be melting in your hands.""  Just hilarious stuff.  The dialogue expanded greatly for all the characters during this second season as well.  Bring on the third season soon!",1073088000,,699,4.234848484848484
1935039,5,B0000E32X3,I'm so looking forward to recieving the Second series of the best show ever. I loved the First Series and have watched it so many times it's hard to keep count. I hope they release other series in the near future as I'm addicted to the show and can't wait to own them all.,1072656000,,272,4.055555555555555
1935040,5,B0000E32X3,"Thank goodness they are releasing the second season of Frasier.  I pre-ordered the first the second I heard of it and have done the same with this.  In addition to being sophisticated, charmingly witty, and sometimes just laugh-out-loud hysterical, Frasier brings poignancy and love to the lives of its characters, and never ceases to point to the moral highground.
A light in the darkness of today's TV trends, Frasier is my favorite show and will always be.",1070841600,4,459,4.9480519480519485
1935041,5,B0000E32X3,"Back when Frasier and Seinfeld were new shows on tv, I wasn't much of a tv watcher and did not ever catch these shows in their first runs.  Now I am completely hooked on these shows as they are syndicated on Fox TV at night!!  I bought the first season of Frasier and absolutely love it!  The humor is so intelligently droll, so adult . . . I have been anxiously awaiting release of the second season!!",1070409600,4,402,4.194805194805195
1935042,5,B0000E32X3,"I tell you, I am so positively excited about the upcoming release of Frasier's second season. I really enjoyed getting hooked by the first season with all of the cute and wacky storylines, and I recall looking forward to the second season when it came out in '94. Like I said, the first season got me hooked, but the second...well, let's just say the second got me running back for more every single season, all ten or so years now. Indeed, the Daphne + Niles storylines kicked up a notch in the second season, we got to see more of the life outside of Frasier's radio station (aka 'The Matchmaker', one of the best half-hour episodes of any show ever), and there was a lot more exploration into Frasier's past, with episodes including Lilith and I believe dear old Sam from Cheers (another of my favorite sitcoms of all time). But in general, ""Frasier""'s second season provided equal if not more belly laughs than the first, and led this show to the greatness that it has achieved. And I am especially thrilled that Paramount shall be releasing season after season of this wonderful show, and I encourage everyone to buy not only season 2, but all those still yet to come.",1070150400,10,1173,4.563981042654029

1936431,5,B0000E32X3,"Frasier is one of the rare sit coms that are intelligent, relying on witticisms rather than slapstick to generate a laugh. This is clearly one of the top 10 sitcoms, IMHO, along with Modern Family, The Andy Griffith Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Seinfeld, MASH, Cheers, with honorable mention going to Get Smart, The Bob Newhart Show.  The acting, writing, directing are all superb.  The first series Kelsey Grammer tried, Back to You, was unfortunately retooled and then cancelled, but it could have easily been one of the best ever.  Season two of Frasier is one of the best of the run.  The first season, as is often the case, was spent fleshing out characters, and Daphne, for example, was much more ditzy in the first year than she ended up being, just as Martin was grumpy in the first dozen or so shows. By the second season, they'd gotten their sea legs, and the series hummed along nicely until.....sorry..... Daphne ran away with Niles, I believe at the end of the 7th season.  The series took a nose dive from there, but the 2nd through 5th seasons were quite spectacular.",1428537600,2,1086,4.635416666666667
1936432,5,B0000E32X3,"When Frasier was introduced to TV viewers in the early 1990s, I was working out of the country. I now have the opportunity to acquaint myself with the wonderful cast and quirky plots. Frasier gives a whole new meaning to ""family"" (dilettante brothers and psychiatrists Frasier and Niles, down-to-earth father Martin, cockney healthcare giver and live-in Daphne, producer Roz of Frasier's mental health broadcasts, and Martin's dog Eddie). There is a host of unforgettable characters, dilemmas, situations, romantic and professional liaisons, and misadventures. Watch an episode or two and you will be hooked. A favorite haunt and backdrop is a coffee house, the studio where Frasier works, and his tastefully and expensively decorated high-rise apartment in Seattle which features his father's ugly, out-of-place, duct-taped recliner. The episode with a Tango (Niles/Daphne) is one of my favorites.",1428105600,,898,5.610294117647059

Some people might find Frasier boring; it's not in any way edgy, or breaking taboos, or even trying to rewrite the formula. It has believable, likable, flawed characters and story lines that observe human nature without being completely shallow or very deep. It's a sitcom, and it doesn't try to be something else.",1425945600,,481,4.807228915662651

I had seen the occasional episode and always enjoyed them but until I started watching the series from the beginning I didn't notice that it was a show that I really should have been watching in first runs.

No cast ever did a better job of creating ""real"" characters and maintaining personal chemistry with so many characters at one time.

The casting of David Hyde Pierce as Niles was brilliant, not only did he look enough like Grammar to be believable as his brother, the two were also mirror images in mannerisms and attitudes.

All in all, as a connoisseur of sit-com, I can say that this is a classic in the genre and I predict that it will still be being enjoyed by our grandchildren's grandchildren.",1414368000,,974,4.705882352941177

All these actors and actresses, including Eddie the Dog, deliver good writing, good scenes and way funny lines.  Once again, they are professionals, some more seasoned than others.  As I get older, I am appreciating the finesse of John Mahoney's acting in particular.

I plan to purchase Frasier Season Three.  More fun to come.",1394841600,,492,4.867469879518072

1936797,5,B0000E32X3,"20 years later and this show is still funny.  I attribute its longevity to clever writing---evidenced by great character development, witty exchanges, and sarcastic quips--- and the talented cast.  They ALL have their shining moments, but Niles (David Hyde Pierce) is the most fun to watch.  His facial expressions convey every conceivable emotion --- often without an accompanying word.  Priceless!  The humor does tend towards the sexual innuendo often, so it's a show to be watched with an older family (young kids would be bored by it anyway).",1392854400,,547,5.170454545454546

Again I wish it had a play all feature, instead of stopping with each episode, but not really a big deal. Love the cast and crew, and special features show who the celebrity caller was each episode.

1936814,5,B0000E32X3,"I LOVE the second season of Frazier. I watch it every day. In fact, I watch Frasier for usually five hours a day, every day. These programs have the power to lift my spirits and calm me down even when I am on the edge of a panic attack and distraught. I have used ""FRASIER Therapy"" in conjunction with my medications and regular therapy for almost 10 years. The program is deeply funny-hysterical-and gives me a belly laugh every episode. The Frasier cast have become my friends and comforters and they have saved my life many times. I am so glad to now have the shows on my Kindle Fire HD so that I can watch them anytime and anywhere, even when washing the dishes and folding clothes. If any of the cast members happen to read this review, I want you to know that I love you and I thank you so much for giving me this gift of your show.

From the opera-loving, high-class doctor brothers, to man-crazy loveable Roz to dingy yet intelligent English Dafney, we get a kick out of these people.  Also the crusty ex-police father and salacious Bulldog--one cant help but get some chuckles.

1936852,5,B0000E32X3,"I Adore ""Frasier"" and I am not sure there has been a quality show since the show ended. Certain perrsonality traits stand out for me on Frasier. ""Martin"" has the most infectious laugh and he is so comfortable in his skin and maintains his integrity. ""Frasier"" is so Sexy and has an incredible voice which leads to his ""Sex Appeal"" He is so sophisticated, just wants to be loved, and manages to always step into hilarious and uncomfortable situations. I favor Daphane in the earlier seasons when she was more flaky. It is bitter sweet because I loved Daphane with Niles, but the writers changed her too much into a demure, stuffy clothing wearing, boring person. I believe it would have been comical to have her marry Niles but still be a little off the wall. ""Roz"" is the Girlfriend you want to have for life, yet you desperately want to help her find a great man, or woman...Martin would have loved that...lol. What can I say about Niles? I so missed him when ""Frasier"" ended. He is so adorable, talented, and physically and generally FUNNY! I Love his fake smile. He mastered his manerisms to be identical to Frasier with a Niles twist. I went looking for any movies Davis Hyde Pierce was in recently and I located a thriller on Prime. I was mesmerized by his talent and ability to , well, be quite the opposite of Niles. I Adore Season 2 of ""Frasier"" as I Adore all the seasons of ""Frasier"".

In the whole series there are less than five episodes that I find a bit below their standards but the rest are top notch and hard to match. Anyone who loved his character on cheers will love watching the evolution of the character on this series. 11 seasons hardly seem enough.

In fact, If we didn't know these people so well then we could only laugh at an actual reaction of  Frasier, Nils or any of the others.  What makes it so funny to me is I find myself laughing before the joke actually happens because I'm anticipating the reaction I'll see.  That takes excellent scripts delivered by excellent actors.

1936983,5,B0000E32X3,"As successful as ""Cheers"" was in the vast array of television sitcoms, ""Frasier"" is not only the most successful spin off in history, but vastly out performs the Boston bar escapades.

1937058,4,B0000E32X3,"Frasier: The Complete Second Season continues (and builds upon) the tradition of strong, witty humor begun in Season One. This season is actually much stronger and full of belly-laughs than season one and is sure to please. While there are few innovations in the characters (they each continue their usual personalities - there are no major plot points in this season, though the marital woes of Niles and the never-seen Maris begin to be discussed) it nevertheless develops the characters more fully. Also, there are surprising moments of pathos and feeling in this season, often unexpected, that show the range of the talented actors in this show.

On a technical note, a great thing about this set is that the season is packaged in a regular DVD case, but with 4 discs packed back-to-back; this makes for more space on your shelf and a better presentation all around.

Here are some of the season's highlights:

1. Slow Tango in South Seattle: In this season opener, Frasier is horrified to discovers that a former acquaintance has written a bestselling book - loosely based on his past!

2. The Matchmaker: Hoping to help Daphne with her dating troubles, Frasier plays matchmaker and a host of romantic misunderstandings ensue.

3. Seat of Power: Frasier and Niles, after failing to fix their commode, hire a duo of plumbers - who turn out to be bullies from their childhood. Look for John C. McGinley (Office Space, Scrubs) in a guest-starring role.

4. Daphne's Room: After Frasier barges into Daphne's room unannounced and disrupts her privacy, a comedy of errors ensues when he tries to make it up to her.

5. An Affair to Forget: Frasier suspects that Maris may be having an affair, and Niles vows to confront the man she is seeing. Look for the hilarious ""translation"" scene towards the end of the episode.

6. The Innkeepers: Niles and Frasier decide to open a restaurant, and fail dismally. While this is well-tread territory for sit-coms (""I Love Lucy"" did something similar in the 1950s) the way horrible disasters keep piling up is comic genius.",1263772800,2,2060,4.865714285714286

1937066,2,B0000E32X3,"This was one of my favorite seasons of Frasier...mainly for 2 episodes.
Disc 4's Agents in America with Fraiser's agent BeBe Glaser played by a hillarious Harriet Sansom Harris. I wish they had put her in more episodes.  The other is Disc 1's the Matchmaker, where Frasier's gay boss thinks that Frasier is romantically interested. And also is under the impression that Frasier's father and brother are also gay.

Major compalint:  The major complaint I have has to do with Paramount's idiotic navigation. There is no ""Watch all episodes"" navigation on the discs, like other TV show DVD have. So when each episode is done you have to click on what episode you want to view next, rather than just watching each one without having to use the clicker. It is aggrivating.

1937100,1,B0000E32X3,"I am as devoted a Frasier fan as most out there, but having seen Season One in Dolby 5.1 with subtitles and other delectable features, I am appalled that the publishers turned so greedy with rolling out a quick and dirty version of subsequent seasons that we have to pay premium prices for such sub-par lemons:

(1) The sound is 2.0 and doesn't sound much better than old mono. Whatever happened to Dolby or DTS? Surely Frasier is recent enough for the producers to have all the necessary bells and whistles (tracks).

(2) The quality of the video is tragically ordinary. It pixelates often, even on a top of the line LCD set. It's more like a VCD slapped with a DVD label.

(3) Subtitles are especially useful for a program that's punch-drunk on esoteric references to high society stuff such as Opera and French wines, but it's remiss in Season Two and beyond.

The only other item on these discs is a boring ""Celebrity Voices"" bit that's only for the particularly nosy as you hear them in the episodes anyway. As much as I find the show top of the heap--and Season Two is probably even sharper than Season One--this is a pathetic excuse for a DVD at its price tag. ""Basic"" DVDs of the caliber that you see for old black and white movies on the bottom shelf should be priced much lower.",1199404800,7,1288,4.468085106382978

1937102,5,B0000E32X3,"Fraiser really hit stride in it's 2nd season. If it weren't for ""Seinfeld"", Fraiser would have probably been the #1 rated show.

One of the best lines was from the episode where Friaser unwittingly offends the city of Seattle after giving misinterpreted advice to a depressed caller to his call-in show.

After talking with his father about how rainy Seattle is, Fraiser retorts ""It rains here so much, the state flower is mildew!"".

If that doesn't give you an idea of how sharp the writting is, I don't know what will.

The casting (both primary & secondary characters) couldn't be more perfect. Friaser's pretentious, snooty, obsessive-compulsive brother Niles was played to perfection by David Hyde Pierce. The father, played by John Mahoney, always knew how to cut Fraiser & Niles down to size with his put-downs. Roz (Peri Gillipen), Fraiser's producer, was always man-hungry and the butt of Fraiser & Niles jokes about her promiscuity. Martin's live-in physical therapist Daphne (Jane Leeves) was the object of Niles' hysterical obssesion.

The secondary characters...Bulldog (the anti-Fraiser), food critic Gil Chesterson, and Fraiser's devious agent Bebe were all scene stealers.

It would be almost impossible to find any ""duds"" in season 2, with many episodes becoming ""instant Fraiser classics"".

There may never have been a sharper, wittier comedy before or since Fraiser...and Season 2 was one of the funniest in television history.",1187827200,,1446,5.288209606986899

Although it is always fun to watch the reruns of Frasier, the ability to sit down and watch the entire series in order is great.  Season two of Frazier further solidified its standing as one of the finest sitcoms ever, and certainly the best written.  This season boasts several hi-lights including the return of Lilith, and a dispute between Frazier and the City of Seattle over the rain.  The Niles and Daphne relationship continues to blossom.  Niles, to me, is still the star of the show.  Though the way he ahd Frasier interact is seamless.  This is another 5 star season of great T.V.

I know there are quite a few Seinfield fans out there but this show, in my opinion, has something for everyone. The DVD series brings the life of Dr. Crane home so that we can now relive our favorite episodes and laugh all over again. The appeal of the show has everything to do with the spoken word. It's one thing for a writer to pen a show but it's an entirely different thing to get the right actor to speak those lines and create some magic. Many people have said that this is the best spinoff because of the casting and I couldn't agree more. There are no lapses or boring moments in the dialogue and that is something one can no longer find on TV.",1153958400,5,762,4.2620689655172415

1937124,5,B0000E32X3,"Started watching Frasier after seeing ""Daphne's Room"" episode 2 years ago, after laughing uncontrollably, I was hooked on the series.  I had heard great reviews as well as how refreshing, witty, and hilarious the  show is, in addition to being a multi-Emmy winner.

I think Season 2 is the best of the series.  I did not enjoy the final season as much as the earlier seasons.",1127088000,2,375,4.636363636363637
1937125,5,B0000E32X3,"The first season was funny but occasionally weighed down by some false notes between Frasier and his father and the unnecessary character of ""Chopper Dave - the weatherman."" Season two has this show proceeding with the hilarious and sophisticated humor that made this show a classic. Highly recommended.",1126742400,,303,5.333333333333333
1937126,5,B0000E32X3,"In my honest opinion, this is the finest season of ""Frasier"" ever, in fact, one of the best seasons in tv sitcom history.

From the first episode ""Slow Tango in Seattle"" (where Frasier's dallience with his piano teacher is the subject of a popular book) to the last ""Dark Victory"" (where Marty's birthday suffers from a city-wide blackout) there isn't a clunker in the bunch.

Disc #1 features the trifecta of ""The Unkindest Cut of All"" where Eddie's park activities have produced a litter of puppies. ""The Matchmaker"" (an instant classic) where Frasier's new boss thinks that Frasier is making a date with him instead of Daphne.  The scene where Marty laughs may be one of the funniest in series history.  ""Flour Child"" has Niles carrying around a 10pd flour bag to simulate what it would be like to care for a baby.  It also has a riotus scene where Niles relates his dream of kidnappers stealing his ""baby"" and sending muffins in the mail.

Disc #2 is another winner, the highlight for me was ""Roz in the Doghouse"" with Bulldog at his absolute finest.  JoBeth Williams turns in a nice performance in ""Adventures in Paradise"".  And ""Burying a Grudge"" has Marty coming to terms with his long-time police partner who's in the hospital.

Disc #3 brings back Sam (a still on-target Ted Dansen) and his soon-to-be wife played by Tia Leone.  And the sumptuous Shannon Tweed gets into the act in ""You Scratch My Book..."".  Even a seeminly minor episode like ""Daphne's Room"" contains huge laughs when Frasier somehow keeps winding up in her room without permission.  Look carefully at the picture Frasier picks up, it's a real gutbuster of a revalation.

Disc #4 has the killer combination of ""An Affair to Forget"" (which won an Emmy for writing) with an unforgetable fencing match between Niles and Maris' fencing instructor.  The oddly titled ""Agents in America, Part III"" brings Bebe (Frasier's agent) back into the fold.  Her ""suicide"" attempt is absolutely hysterical. And finally ""The Innkeepers"" (another instant classic) where the Brothers Crane foolishly buy a restaurant and disaster awaits.

Extras:
There is a commentary track for ""The Matchmaker"" with writer Joe Keenan & director David Lee.  It is informative and rather fun, especially when they point out some of the missed dialogue and scenes that were ment to be included.

Also included are the typical run of edited scenes from different episodes under a theme, like ""Roz's Dating Tips"", ""The Mystery of Maris"", & ""The Niles and Daphne Dating Attraction"" are perfunctory and not necessary.  But exceptions include ""And Then There Was Eddie"" which features a nice intro of ""Eddie"" on the beach & ""Marching On Season 2"" where Peter Casey & David Lee extoll the virtues of that particular season (Peter Casey declares that in his 23 years of tv experience, no season ever matched Frasier's Season 2, which is a bold statement for sure).  The interviews were shot at the same time as the ones presented on the Season One DVD.

Overall, this collection is a must for Frasier fans.  If you fell in love with the show in the later years, you owe it to yourself to get this DVD set.

Tidbits:

""Adventures in Paradise"" is the first two-part episode of the Frasier series.

Although her appearence lasts about 2 seconds, ""Adventures in Paradise (Part II)"" is the first time we see Diane Chambers (Shelly Long) on ""Frasier"".

There is a blooper of sorts that happens in ""Adventures in Paradise (Part I)"".  Both Frasier & Roz look at the picture of Madeline (in Seattle Style magazine) on the ""left"" page.  When Bulldog looks at the picture, he looks at the ""right"" page.

Bulldog also seems to have gained some weight during Season 2. Compare his state of fitness between ""Roz in the Doghouse"" and the stinger of ""The Innkeepers"".

Look for Diedrich Bader (Oswald on the ""Drew Carey Show"") as Roz's date in ""The Innkeepers"".

In ""Roz in the Doghouse"", the song ""Mr. Pitiful"" is played over a montage of Frasier's new producers.  I believe this is the first time in series history that a publish song was used in such a fashion.",1115510400,22,4081,4.802292263610315
1937127,5,B0000E32X3,"Along with Friends and Seinfeld, Kelsey Grammer's Cheers spin-off, Frasier, dominated the prime time television landscape during the 1990's. Grammer plays the role of Dr. Frasier Crane who, fresh off of his divorce from Lilith, moves back to his hometown of Seattle where he lands a gig as a radio psychiatrist. Frasier's father, Marty Crane (John Mahoney), a Seattle cop recently shot in an attempted convenience store robbery is in need of physical therapy. Frasier and his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) make an effort to mend their relationship with Marty whose plaid shirts and penchant for sports and beer strikes a dramatic contrast with their wine club, opera house culture. After a little prodding, Marty and his dog Eddie (Moose) move into Frasier's upscale apartment, and Frasier hires Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a housekeeper and physical therapist to look after the two cranes.

The entirety of the show takes place in mostly three places - Frasier's radio station where he works with show producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin), Frasier's apartment, and the favorite hangout of Niles and Frasier, Caf Nervosa. A witty comedic exploration of the nation's clash of cultures (also illustrated by Frasier's run-ins with sports guy Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe), Frasier stands alone as one of the best-written shows in television history. Not a single episode can be considered a dud.

The Frasier (Season 2) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including episode #40 where Sam Malone (Ted Danson) visits Frasier in Seattle. Sam fills Frasier in on what the various members of the Cheers gang are now up to. In the next to last episode of the season, Frasier and Niles (against Martin's advice) purchase a restaurant they enjoyed during their youth and rename it ""Les Freres Heureux"" or ""The Happy Brothers"". The two inevitably run the operation into the ground (on opening night, nonetheless)...

1937129,5,B0000E32X3,"If you like dry,witty humor FRASIER is for you! The episodes ""The Matchmaker"" and ""The Innkeepers"" are worth the price by themselves. This is a no brainer.

1937140,2,B0000E32X3,"""Frasier: The Complete Second Season"" is the companion DVD box set to Season One. It stars Kelsey Grammer as the imminent psychiatrist and radio personality, Dr. Frasier Crane, David Hyde Pierce as his even more neurotic and insecure younger brother, Niles, John Mahoney as their curmudgeon father, Martin, Jane Leeves as scatterbrain physical therapist Daphne Moon and Peri Gilpin as Frasier's calculating hard knock radio programmer, Roz.

If you thought season one was a riot, just wait till you get a load of season two: an inspired potpourri of hilarity beginning with a tell-all book about Frasier's secret affair with his piano teacher while he was still a teenager. Also highlighted in this bunch of episodes is Eddie gets fixed, Martin's favorite bar, Duke's, gets demolished by an investment that Frasier and Niles make, Niles attempts to bond with a bag of flour in order to discover whether or not he's ready to be a father, and, a governor's candidate that Frasier endorses turns out to be a nut job who believes that aliens abducted him in the past. Inspired and gifted performances, shoot-from-the-hip writing and hilarious cameos make season two one of the great television highlights of any series ever put on the small screen.

Paramount's new DVD, ""Frasier: The Complete Second Season"" aptly delivers all 24 episodes of this trend setting comedy in a deluxe four disc box set. Unfortunately, Paramount's DVD quality seems to be lagging behind Season One. Though colors are accurately presented with a subtle muted palette and good contrast levels, and blacks are deep and solid, there is an excessive amount of edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details throughout many of the episodes (more than half) that is distracting to say the least. Fine details become hard edged and highly unstable.  Many of the vertical and horizontal lines in Frasier's apartment are in a constant state of mobility, flickering in and out of each frame and thoroughly distracting from the performances. As with Season One, certain episodes continue to have a slightly hazy look to them. Several episodes suffer from color imbalance in which tonal quality and brightness seem to shift - not only from scene to scene but shot to shot. Overall, these imperfections are inexcusable. The audio is stereo and very nicely balanced. Extras include a brief but succinct featurette on the inspiration for season two, a benign ""Roz's Dating Tips"" sort of game that one has to access by toggling on the remote, short snippets that illustrate all the guest star cameo voice overs used as call-in guests and audio commentaries on selected episodes. If you're a fan of this television series you may want to snag this box set. But the image quality is far below par for a series of this vintage!",1092873600,11,2783,4.993534482758621

Despite the fact I'm a real frasier fan I must admit that the most disappointing point on the DVD's is that there is no english hearing impaired version, and strictly no other foreign language available. Obviously no further frasier versions will be released in Europe. Bad luck for all fans without a high level of english like me...",1092355200,4,531,4.846153846153846
1937142,5,B0000E32X3,"I absolutely love Frasier and am very happy with the DVDs.  Unfortunately there is a problem with one of the episodes from SEason 2.  At the beginning of 'Daphne's Room' on Disc 3, Frasier begins to sing Great Balls of Fire.  This 5 second sequence has been deliberately cut out, as the credits that roll over this sequence run over the part of the episode that follows.  So it is deliberate.  I live in Australia and the distributors here say it is not a fault from there end but back in the US.  But how can I get this fixed, does this problem exist on the US print, and why would this happen?  I love the show, and despite this problem it is a great disc.  So many great episodes, but I do wnat to get it fixed but do not know what to do.  I thought it was importnat though for people to know and maybe suggest something.  Thanks.",1088467200,,833,4.15

The special features are stupid as all hell (dating tips especially) but the episodes are the reason people buy the stuff. Notable ones are The unkindest cut (disc 1), the club (disc 3), fool me once shame on you fool me twice (disc 3) and the matchmaker (disc 1).
There's an episode where Frasier continues to insist that men in general are trustworthy and then he gets betrayed. And there's one where he takes a call from a guy who's afraid to use the phone (that's at the beginning of the club). And there's an episode about confused sexuality. It's funny. Most spin-off's of tv shows don't work, but this spin-off of Cheers definitely did.",1084579200,2,857,4.3625

There are some terrific episodes on this set, such as ""The Innkeepers, "" where Frasier and Niles' attempt to run a restaurant with haute cuisine goes spectacularly awry.  There are many others that people have already mentioned, so I don't need to go further, just watch the set!
To my great sadness, the show will be ending after this season, but major kudos to Paramount for releasing Frasier on DVD so we can retain the laughs and the memories forever!",1083628800,,577,4.528846153846154

1937147,4,B0000E32X3,"Frasier's second season was incredibly solid; no single episode can be viewed as a ""weak link"".  More uncomfortable situations, more Daphne/Niles tension, more more more!
Extras: The commentary and extras were really interesting, but some of the extras were just montages of snippets from the shows rather than any sort of commentary or explanation.  (eg, I know how great Eddie is, but I wish I could've seen more footage of him being trained, or interviews with his trainer).  I'm glad the extras were more solid than in Season 1, but I'd always love more, of course!  The packaging is really nice and sturdy.
Biggest complaint (and again the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5): No sub-titles. The closed-captions are there, but on many TVs it's impossible to bring those up without muting the TV, which somewhat defeats the purpose. That said, though, the audio is generally very easy to understand and I wished for subtitles only on a handful of occasions.

Once she bought Season 1 on DVD, I watched all the episodes crying with laughter. And when she bought Season 2, I laughed even harder. This season is definitley worth your cash. It's even better than the first season. And has some great bonus material. If you love Frasier and want to watch something that will leave you in tears, then get this. Some of my favorite episodes on this season that will leave you laughing so hard are:
Daphne's Room - I had to watch it over and over again because it was just so damn funny.
The Inkeepers - Niles and Frasier buy a restaraunt. And total chaos rises!
Flour Child - Niles is thinking about having a child w/ Marice but isn't sure. So he gets a bag of flour and treats it like a baby!

There are some priceless slapstick moments throughout, but the standouts include Niles having his words translated from English to Spanish to German to his wife's Bavarian fencing instructor (Niles' rival for Maris' affections in a late-in-the-season episode), and the kitchen distasters in the episode where the Crane brothers open a restaurant.  That premise is certainly not an original one in sitcom history, but it gets pulled off with such wit and style that it seems fresh and new.

It is very intelligent comedy, keep on watching the episodes over and over again, because every time there is something else you laugh about. Sharp, witty comedy. Stylish and sophisticated.
For me Frasier is the top comedy show, followed closely by the Golden Girls and Will & Grace. The rest can only lower their heads in shame!

That being said, it's so great to be able to watch these episodes again when ever I want. I don't need to review the show here for you, you've seen it, and you either like it or you don't and I'm not likely to change your mind.
But it your wavering, don't. This show will stand up very well over time, because it's so strongly character driven.
The DVD quality, and features are first rate.
One comment to one of the previous reviewers; I think that Roz was the second most important character, and my personal favorite. And I will be interested to see how she does (the character) when they bring the show to end.",1074643200,,680,4.2384615384615385
1937155,5,B0000E32X3,"I zipped right through this DVD set. Frasier's second season is just as strong as the first, and in many respects stronger. The Niles/Frasier dynamic is played out to great result, the writing is sharp, the acting perfect, there are guest appearances by Lilith and Sam Malone, and the season is nearly perfect, without even one clunker or filler episode. The result is some of the richest situational comedy ever to appear on TV.
Some of the highlights include the gay/straight farce ""The Matchmaker"", ""The Botched Language of Cranes"" is classic Frasier, where everything goes wrong, then gets even worse, after Frasier makes a comment about Seattle that pits the city against him. There is also an episode where Roz leaves to produce Bulldog's show (Roz in the Doghouse), ""An Affair to Forget"" has Frasier suspecting Maris of cheating on Niles and won an Emmy for writing. There's also a visit from the nefarious agent Bebe (Agents in America, Part III), as well as a great episode that has Niles and Frasier trying to run a restaurant, which predictably goes haywire. These are but a few highlights of this fantastic season of television.
In short, this is as close to perfection as television gets. Highly recommended.",1074556800,41,1221,4.932038834951456
1937156,5,B0000E32X3,"The sheer joy with which I watch this show has yet to be matched by any other program.  The cast is first-rate, the writing is meticulous (it's amazing how the characters all have different rythms of dialogue), and the timing is, for lack of a better term, perfect (something that seems to be lost on most of the new shows on today...they should take notes).  Everything meshes with this show.
  The guest spots are great for anyone who followed 'Cheers' (I was very young, but can still remember some of it).  It really helps to see some of the people they allude to at times. The extras are a bit skimpy, but there aren't many tv shows on the dvd format that can boast a treasure trove of special features.  They should perhaps dig up old talk-show appearances, do commentaries with the cast, have a gag reel.  Although the dvd itself lacks in bells and whistles,  the quality of the show more than makes up for it.  I'm already looking forward to owning season three!",1073865600,2,970,4.497142857142857
1937157,5,B0000E32X3,"This is one of my absolute favorite shows!  This is one of 2 that I'm bothering to buy on dvd.  I bought this the day it came out, and I have 2 episodes left.
Things I love about Frasier:
 - The thing between Niles and Daphne.
 - NILES!!!
 - The tension between Frasier and Martin.
 - Eddie (how could you not get some laughs out of him?)
 - When Lilith makes her appearances.
To name but a few.  The second season is great because the charectors have been established, so they can have more fun with them than they did in the first season.  This had a guest appearance from Sam (From Cheers...hey, I didn't know Frasier was a spin off from Cheers until about a year ago, I can't be the only one!)as well as Lilith, whom I adore. I also liked how they made fun of themselves about how in Cheers Frasier was an only child and his dad was dead, but now he has a dad and a brother. Silly!
I can't think of a single episode I didn't care for.  This is VERY reasonable priced, there are 4 dvd's and it's nicely packaged.
In short....BUY THIS!",1073865600,,1037,4.14
1937158,4,B0000E32X3,"Tossed Salads:
*Nice picture/sound quality
*Beautiful packaging
*Easy to access menu's
*Some extra's, more would be nice but then again, the price is so reasonable, I'm thankful they didn't go the 'X-Files $100' route.
*Great Cast. The core cast is stellar, typically even guest stars hold their own which is unusual for sitcoms.
*Any appearance by Bebe is a real treat!
Scrambled Eggs:
*The 'call-in' humor really never works. Being an avid AM Talk Radio listener myself and knowing what lengths they went through getting 'celebrity voices' for the call-ins, the payoffs are generally quite small.
*Too much Eddie, the dog humor also really never works either. Constantly reffering to Eddie staring at Frasier etc., got old the first hundred times I heard it. Plus, the dog is so stiff and formal it is quite distracting.
*Also, I really have no interest in 'Bull Dog' the character, he tries way too hard.
*Bebe is a terribly underused character for this series, I wish they would have seen fit to work her in somewhere!
In conclusion, I would like to add this show when it hits is as good as anything on television. It may be an aquired taste but when it caters to the strengths of the characters is when it is true magic. Sadly there are some eps here I feel are fillers, as with the first season, but it is still gaining momentum in its infancy and I eagerly await season 3.",1073606400,3,1379,4.655737704918033
1937159,5,B0000E32X3,"I have always enjoyed ""Frasier"".  The first season tended to be about Frasier's relationship with his father and adjusting to living together.  Season  Two was more focused on Frasier's and his brother Niles' relationship.  Niles' growing attraction to Daphne, his father's physical therapist, is also  highlighted.  Season Two was consistently funny and deserved the best comedy  Emmy that it won that year (one of a record-breaking five Emmys in a row for Best Comedy.)
I loved the episode, ""The  Botched Language of the Cranes"", where psychiatrist Frasier tells a depressed  caller on his radio show to move out of Seattle to a sunnier place where it  doesn't rain so much.  Of course, the whole city of Seattle reacts to this, and Frasier has to  figure out what to do about it!
Five extras shorts:
""Marching On To Season Two""
""The Mystery of Maris Continues""
""Roz's Dating Tips""
""The Niles and Daphne Attraction""
""And Then There Was Eddie""
are pretty short (about 20 minutes total) and not as interesting as they sound.  I did enjoy them, but I probably won't watch them again.  The feature commentary track on ""The Matchmaker"" episode was worth watching.  I was pleased to see a list of the celebrity callers!  These were not always listed in the credits, and I always want to know who the callers are.
The video quality is much better than the cable television signal that I get.  On my big screen TV there is some graininess, but not terrible. The mode is full screen rather than widescreen. The audio is Dolby  Digital 2.0, which I find adequate for a sit-com.  The voices are clear and easy  to understand.  Overall, the video and audio quality were very acceptable for a televison show of this type.  I was pleased with this DVD set, and recommend it.",1073347200,35,1762,4.745874587458746

Of course--as time drags on--everything starts to lose a little bit of magic, but so far, the good Dr. Crane is still in fine form. If anything, the show might have gotten a bit better in year 2--lofty standards, considering it was great from the start.

A lot of memorable episodes, obviously; a few that standout; ""The Matchmaker,"" ""The Candidate,"" ""Agents in America, Part 3."" Of course, I don't need to spell out the ongoing mystery of Maris and why she never shows up. I think most fans caught on pretty early (wink and a nod).

I think the entire cast is well-balanced during these seasons - creating unforgettable characters such as Frasier's Satanic agent -  showcasing Mercedes Ruehl at her comic best - Bulldog  the dawg's dawg - Daphne slightly on the lunatic fringe etc.
My issue with giving this this intelligent, witty well-written series 5 stars has to do with my overall disappointment in the DVDproduct in total.
The first season case was badly cracked and had no DVDs inside.  The other 2 indicated aspect ratio of 4:3 not 1:33. as noted in Amz. specs. In any case the picture was not sharp/the sound was not good. No Closed Caption feature. or play all function.
I didn't enjoy the later seasons as much as the focus shifted more to the brothers who really were irritating  without mediating
strong characters - Daphne and Roz went limp - Marsha Mason was chalk on blackboard ....Overall I think the first 3 seasons capture the best of Frasier - season 4 starts a downturn with farcical histrionics by the brothers and the soul of the show seems gone - different writers?  Some of the later seasons had some bright spots - Jean Smart's character was fun ... but overall it is a bit much to call all 11 seasons excellent - I believe.",1507161600,,1277,4.632743362831858
