1640908,4,B00005OCV2,"This is the Ealing comedy that got away -it bears all the signs of an Ealing movie but was not made by that studio. It revolves around two middle class couples in mid 50's England ,the men of whom are vinatge car enthusiasts. They both enter the annual London to Brighton rally for vintage cars (an event which still takes place).Genevieve  is a 1904 roadster owned by one of the couples ,Alan and Wendy ,played by respectively John Gregson and Dinah Sheridan .On the return trip they challenge their friends Anbrose (Kenneth More)and Rosalind (Kay Kendall)to s friendly race -first to get to Westminster Bridge is the victor. What starts out a friendly rivalry gets more intense as the finish line draws ever nearer.-with sabotage and sharp practice abounding .

The script ,by William Rose ,is marvellous .Christopher Challis -in charge of photography-gives us warm and appealing colour for the scenes of a glowing English countryside and the harmonica score by Larry Adler is perfect -mellow and gentle. All 4 leads are excellent and each are given precious bits of ""business ""for comedic impact .Especially memorable are Kendall's inebriated trumpet solo (""I'll show you how to play the plumpet "")and More's running battle with Rosalind's dog. .There is also a brief but telling cameo near the end from Arthur Wontner who was a pioneer cinema Sherlock Holmes
The astute direction by Henry Cornelius underlines the tragedy of his early death (age 45 )soon after the movie was made ,

This a both a celebration of Britishnes and a gentle mockery of it .It boasts optimism ,charm and innocence -all laudable things to demonstrate .This is a quiet pleasure-and anglophiles especially  will like it",1197244800,,1697,4.985865724381625
1640909,4,B00005OCV2,"This British comedy pits two couples and their vintage roadsters against one another in a cross-country race.  This was a great movie in its day, and is much better than American road race movies.
I was a young boy when saw Genevieve (1953) in a theater in Berkeley, California in the early 1950's when it was first released. My parents had taken me along with one of my dad's faculty friends to see the movie. She was recovering from surgery at the time and literally came very close to busting her stiches.  We laughed and laughed and laughed.
I am glad to see that a DVD is out, even if is a foreign edition.",1196985600,6,611,4.350877192982456
1640910,5,B00005OCV2,"I saw this movie years ago on public television and loved it.  Today, it is especially fun to watch the glimpse of 1954 London and to remember how much fun life can be!",1167782400,,168,4.090909090909091
1640911,5,B00005OCV2,"In the late 1940s and early '50s, some of the funniest films were being cranked out by the Brits, films of great wit and sly humor. Numbered among these comedies of  English manners were the Ealing Studio-produced The Lavender Hill Mob, The Ladykillers, and Kind Hearts and Coronets.  And then there was Genevieve, called ""the best Ealing comedy that never was"" by the British Film Institute. Director Henry Cornelius, formerly of Ealing Studio, had offered Genevieve to that same film company but was turned down. Big mistake for Ealing.

Genevieve tells the tale of two couples, Alan McKim and his wife Wendy and Ambrose Claverhouse and his model friend Rosalind, who undertake a yearly vintage automobile rally which starts from London and ends at Brighton. En route, both Alan and Ambrose's vehicles take turns in breaking down. The resulting back-and-forth banter, compounded with the surfacing of certain old envies, turns a friendly rivalry between best chums Alan and Ambrose into a serious enmity. In the heat of the moment, Alan and Ambrose engage in a gentleman's bet of one hundred pounds as to who first gets back to London. Things, of course, then proceed to get progressively and comedically insane...

It's always neat (and a bit satisfying) to witness straight-laced, proper Englishmen turn into raving lunatics, reduced to formulating zany schemes and indulging in glorious pettiness. John Gregson as Alan, Kenneth More as Ambrose, and Kay Kendall as Rosalind are tremendous in their madcap roles. This was, in fact, Ms. Kendall's coming-out party and she was touted by critics as the next Carole Lombard. But her potential was never realized as she died of leukemia in 1959, at the age of 33. Lovely Dinah Sheridan is great as Wendy, Alan's patient saint of a wife, providing the futile voice of reason.

Watch for the classic restaurant/club scene in which an inebriated Rosalind picks up a trumpet and plays the title song. See also how a little girl and her ice cream, a parked lorry and an elderly antique car enthusiast can hilariously cramp a racer's style. Oh man, this is a funny, funny movie.

John Gregson, by the way, reportedly didn't drive before this film. In fact, in several long shots, Dinah Sheridan had to give him driving instructions under her breath. And Genevieve, to illustrate the whimsy so inherent in these classic British comedies, is not the name of a woman character in the movie but is Alan's 1904 French-made Darracq vintage automobile.",1150070400,12,2487,4.995169082125604

Like a marathon run for octogenarians, we knew there would be casualties and many that wouldn't make it. Gregson and crew beautifully captured the passion and commitment of this unique motoring clique, and Dinah Sheridan and Kay Kendall portrayed the forbearance of many of the women who, though they didn't quite share their partner's manic commitment, still embraced the experience. With all their heart, sometimes not, but still they were there. A reflection of a bygone time. These days, though the cars are fewer, there are more women entrants, a fact I find wonderous.

1640940,4,B00005OCV2,"I may be wrong, but my guess is that some film producer decided that they wanted to make a movie about the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, a tradition that began in 1896 and continues to the present day.  The result was an often charming, if not overly funny, British comedy, GENEVIEVE (1953).

John Gregson is a London barrister, equally in love with his patient wife (Dinah Sheridan) and his antique car, Genevieve.  His best friend (Kenneth More) is also enamored with vintage cars, and the two men make it a regular practice to do the annual Run to Brighton.  Gregson will be riding with his wife, while More has invited his new girl friend (Kay Kendall), a fashion model, who brings along her very large dog.

Aside from a few breakdowns, the drive to Brighton is relatively uneventful, but because of a latent jealousy that finally surfaces between Gregson and More about Sheridan, who dated More prior to her marriage, the two men decide to race back to London and neither one is above using dirty tricks to win the contest.  Indeed, this second half of the movie anticipates more elaborate film comedies like IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD and THE GREAT RACE.

There are some amusing, quite memorable sequences in GENEVIEVE , particularly Gregson and Sheridans stay at a rundown hotel, operated by Joyce Grenfell; and especially, the nightclub scene in which a soused Kay Kendal decides to play the trumpet.

On the other hand, the picture itself, written by William Rose and directed by Henry Cornelius is a slow starter.  The main plot (i.e. the jealousy factor and the race home) doesnt really kick in until the halfway point and, even then, with Gregson and More being best friends, the stakes are not that high.

Also, Gregson and Ms. Sheridan may have been fine dramatic actors, but unlike More and Ms. Kendall, they seem to lack the proper innate timing for playing comedy.  I have to wonder how much funnier this movie would have been if Dirk Bogarde and Claire Bloom (the producers first choices) had played Gregsons and Sheridans roles.

Nevertheless, GENEVIEVE  does have sufficient moments of fun, and its distributor, VCI Entertainment , has done a fine job of restoring the Technicolor comedy to its full glory.  The DVD also features a Making of featurette, which includes interviews with Dinah Sheridan and others who contributed to the picture.

Incidentally, GENEVIEVE  was nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Screenplay (William Rose) and Best Original Score (Larry Adler).

1640951,3,B00005OCV2,"""Genevieve,"" (1953).  This Oscar-nominated classic British comedy comes down the years not only in full color, most unusual for the time, but in lastingly saturated color of the green English countryside.  The  early road picture, directed by Henry Cornelius, follows two couples entered in the London-to-Brighton classic car rally. Their friendly rivalry heats up when during a quarrel, Alan  McKim ,(John Gregson), wagers more than he can afford, that he and his wife Wendy, (Dinah Sheridan), in their antique car Genevieve, will win the race.  Thereby beating Ambrose Claverhouse (Kenneth More) and his fashion model date Rosalind Peters (Kay Kendall) to their destination. They pull various dirty tricks which escalate to acts of sabotage as the two teams race back toward London's Westminster Bridge.  Ambrose's date Rosalind must endure her wet and dirty maiden voyage on the rally; Wendy McKim, on the other hand, knows the drill, and has packed extra clothes.  This fondly remembered movie has been hard to find for years; it is now available - with subtitles, how helpful!--though not so many extras on the disk.

I believe it was an accepted principle of comedy that a production should be filtered through the sensibilities of `normal' people.  Thus we have the McKims, as played by Dinah Sheridan (who gets top billing), and John Gregson, given more screen time and higher star billings.  But I can claim no knowledge of either of them.  Much better known today are the comic actor Kenneth More, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-39-Steps/dp/B00A5IXI7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 39 Steps</a>) as Claverhouse.  And, outstandingly, though she left us shockingly young, Kay Kendall (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Girls/dp/B00008AOWL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Girls</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Reluctant-Debutante/dp/B004KN3NXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Reluctant Debutante </a>) as Rosalind Peters.  Kendall, a Golden Globe winner who was married to outstanding British actor Rex Harrison, died at 33, in London, of leukemia, cutting off what might well have been a brilliant comic career.  She came from an English music hall family background, which may well have had something to do with her most famous scene in the film - the film's most famous, show-stopping  scene--in which she drunkenly stands up in a nightclub and plays the trumpet (voiced by Kenny Baker).  Popular comic actress Joyce Grenfell  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Belles-of-St-Trinian-s/dp/B001344YU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Belles of St. Trinian's </a>) has a funny cameo as a Brighton hotel proprietress.  Other comic favorites such as Reginald Beckwith and Geoffrey Keen round out the cast.  The joyous harmonica theme is by Larry Adler, who, when blacklisted by Hollywood, simply took up his career on the other side of the pond.

In reading other reviewers, I can see that they often say this movie was a favorite of their Mom's or Dad's.  But I am older than most other reviewers, and this movie was a great favorite of mine.  It was the first British movie I ever saw, as a young child, and left some lasting impressions.  I was stunned that a woman could get up in public and play a raucous trumpet.  And I desperately wanted to live in a cute little mews house, as the McKims did, presumably because it was cheap.  Unfortunately I was much too young to be buying mews houses then, could only beg for doll houses, and, as an adult, never could afford a mews house::they  became terribly chic and expensive.  I remember the film as a laugh a minute, of course, but after seeing it again after a very long wait, find it a bit of a slo-go; and actually rather genteel and restrained through most of the race.  And it clearly demonstrates the era's rather demeaning attitude toward women.  Never mind, back then I grew to love the dinner gong logo of the J. Arthur Rank Organisation, and to salivate the moment I saw and heard it, in the expectation of a delicious entertainment to come.  This one is still tasty, colorful and flavorful.",1365984000,6,4225,5.55625

1640958,5,B00005OCV2,"Genevieve is a delightful British comedy from 1953, winner of both the BAFTA (British Oscars) Best British Film and the Golden Globe Best Foreign Film awards. It is a story of two antique car buffs (John Gregson and Kenneth More) who through circumstance and misadventure end up challenging each other to a grudge-match race from Brighton to London. The comedic trials are shared by a long-suffering wife (Dinah Sheridan) and a new girlfriend (Kay Kendall).

I had remembered Genevieve fondly from my one childhood viewing over 50 years ago, and had wanted a copy for many years. I eventually found a British release that required a region 2 DVD player, but its picture quality was marginal. A later Korean copy was worse. Now this fine film is available on Blu-ray, and playable on North American players. The video and sound are not reference quality, but nonetheless satisfactory, and likely the best we will ever get. A note on aspect ratios: films made before 1954 were in the aspect ratio of 1.37 to 1. This was ""full screen"" on the old 4:3 televisions. Modern screens are 16:9, and much better for displaying widescreen films. Those who are distressed by black bands to the left and right on their television screen when viewing old films in so-called ""full"" mode can merely push the ""picture size"" button (""pic size"", or ""format"") on your TV remote to change the aspect ratio. This will result in some distortion of the picture or loss of image at the edges.  When viewing an old movie I always run through the options by repeatedly pressing the format button, then selecting the image that looked best. Almost invariably for old 1.37:1 films this is either ""full"" (with black bars at the sides) or ""justify"" (or ""just""), which stretches the left and right edges to fill the screen, but stretches the center image less so distortion is not obvious.

Genevieve is typical of the good-natured comedies released by the J. Arthur Rank Organization and the Ealing Studios during the 1950s, and is considered by many to be the best of its kind.

What a happy discovery it is to learn that ""Genevieve,"" as well as other low-budget and precious gems such as ""The Smallest Show on Earth (1957),"" or, ""Brief Encounter"" (1945), has earned a continuing and current appreciation.

1640974,5,B00005OCV2,"In the late 1940s and early '50s, some of the funniest films were being cranked out by the Brits, films of great wit and sly humor. Numbered among these comedies of English manners were the Ealing Studio-produced The Lavender Hill Mob, The Ladykillers, and Kind Hearts and Coronets. And then there was Genevieve, called ""the best Ealing comedy that never was"" by the British Film Institute. Director Henry Cornelius, formerly of Ealing Studio, had offered Genevieve to that same film company but was turned down. Big mistake for Ealing.

Genevieve tells the tale of two couples, Alan McKim and his wife Wendy and Ambrose Claverhouse and his model friend Rosalind, who undertake a yearly vintage automobile rally which starts from London and ends at Brighton. En route, both Alan and Ambrose's vehicles take turns in breaking down. The resulting back-and-forth banter, compounded with the surfacing of certain old envies, turns a friendly rivalry between best chums Alan and Ambrose into a serious enmity. In the heat of the moment, Alan and Ambrose engage in a gentleman's bet of one hundred pounds as to who first gets back to London. Things, of course, then proceed to get progressively and comedically insane...

It's always neat (and a bit satisfying) to witness straight-laced, proper Englishmen turn into raving lunatics, reduced to formulating zany schemes and indulging in glorious pettiness. John Gregson as Alan, Kenneth More as Ambrose, and Kay Kendall as Rosalind are tremendous in their madcap roles. This was, in fact, Ms. Kendall's coming-out party and she was touted by critics as the next Carole Lombard. But her potential was never realized as she died of leukemia in 1959, at the age of 33. Lovely Dinah Sheridan is great as Wendy, Alan's patient saint of a wife, providing the futile voice of reason.

Watch for the classic restaurant/club scene in which an inebriated Rosalind picks up a trumpet and plays the title song. See also how a little girl and her ice cream, a parked lorry and an elderly antique car enthusiast can hilariously cramp a racer's style. Oh man, this is a funny, funny movie.

John Gregson, by the way, reportedly didn't drive before this film. In fact, in several long shots, Dinah Sheridan had to give him driving instructions under her breath. And Genevieve, to illustrate the whimsy so inherent in these classic British comedies, is not the name of a woman character in the movie but is Alan's 1904 French-made Darracq vintage automobile.",1321142400,,2485,4.995169082125604
1640975,5,B00005OCV2,"""Genevieve"" is one of my favorite films.  I've loved it ever since it came to theatres in the fifties.  I have an old copy of a VHS that I have looked at a couple of times a year, and it never failed to put me in a good mood.  The new transfer is vastly superior and has marvelous extras, but ""Genevieve"" prevails because of the (1) four fabulous stars (Sheridan, Gregson, More and especially Kay Kendall), (2) sparkling script, (3) technicolor photography of the British countryside, (4) exciting and funny chase at the end, and (5) music written and performed by harmonica great Larry Adler.  In short, ""Genevieve"" is about as perfect as a film can be.  If you haven't seen it, I reccomend that you get yourself a copy immediately. ENJOY!",1318032000,,740,4.575757575757576
1640976,5,B00005OCV2,"Genevieve is one of those wonderful 1950's British comedies that prove that if you have a smart script and good actors, you are three quarters of the way home. Combine that with an atmospheric soundtrack on the mouth organ by Larry Adler that transports you to a magically nostalgic world of 50's Britain.
The film is about two friends who are veteran car nuts and the long suffering women in their lives. They are entered in the two-day London to Brighton Veteran Car Run and the film follows the trials and tribulations the two couples have getting their cars the 58 miles there and back again. The film may not provoke huge laughter or be terribly deep, but it is endlessly watchable, largely due to the great chemistry all the actors have with each other. Gregson, More, Sheridan and Kendall are all on top form, helped no end by playing fully rounded out, believable characters. The same can be said for all the lesser roles too. Joyce Grenfell has a wonderful cameo as the concierge of the abjectly awful hotel Alan and Wendy (Gregson and Sheridan) are forced to stay in when they finally arrive in Brighton.

Image quality on the blu ray is a little soft and a little red shifted on occasions (understandable given that the film is nearly 60 years old) but otherwise is easily the best version of the movie available.
It is a little light on extras, a good documentary on the making of the film and a gallery of images.

If you like the Ealing style of British comedies, then you are going to enjoy this one no end. Just sit back and marvel at the seeming effortless of a near perfect movie.",1315440000,7,1598,4.525951557093426

Directed by: Henry Cornelius

Another great film from the British Invasion - VCI has restored and brought from their vaults

Light hearted comedy about an antique car rally and the competitive relationship between two friends. Gregson is especially good as the bewildered husband who loves his old car--called Genevieve, baited by his larger than life friend Kenneth More, accepts a bet on who will return to London first.

Sheridan is also sharp as the loving wife who wants a different weekend but who gets into the spirit of things. Kendall sparkling as an upper class fashion model with an unexpected capacity for trumpet playing and heavy drinking almost steals the film.

Joyce Grenfell is funny as the hotel clerk.  When giving the rules of the hotel to
Dinah Sheridan and John Gregson, in dismay can't believe what they're hearing.  Just then
another tenant walks by and hears them, she then replies to Grenfell ""Are they Americans?""
Also the clock across the square that tolls the hour and the inner workings of the clock that
is a bit distracting.

A splendid film of a long forgotten era of English film making, no film of this type has even come close.
I had tears of laughter and totally kept recalling various scenes with a joyful chuckle.

A catchy harmonica soundtrack by Larry Adler, keeps the tempo and spirits high on this very lively film from the Brits.

by Henry Cornelius

Had a rough day at the office? Need to escape from the pressures of modern day life, yet don't quite feel up to the continuous explosions and pyrotechnics that pass for entertainment in today's motion pictures? Want to see one of the nicest films about automobiles ever made? Then, I highly recommend the movie Genevieve.

This film, made in 1953 on a super-tight budget, by a 39 year-old director who was also the film's producer, has old cars, romance, comedy, gentle action, along with sex appeal and charm enough to drain away the day's tensions--it almost guarantees you'll be in a good mood after seeing it.

The story is simple: two couples are entered in the annual London to Brighton Rally, which (for those unfamiliar with it) is for cars built before 1905. Alan McKim (played by John Gregson) is a lawyer (barrister in the UK) whose wife Wendy (played by Dinah Sheridan) is growing tired of going on the event each year. She's also unhappy about the time that McKim lavishes on his automobile, the 1904 Darracq named Genevieve.

Meanwhile, the wonderfully named Ambrose Claverhouse (played by Kenneth More), who is an advertising executive and something of a playboy, boasts about the reliability and performance of his 1904 Spyker. Claverhouse shows up at the starting line each year with a different female companion--invariably young, glamorous, and beautiful. This year he arrives with fashion model Rosalind Peters (played by Kay Kendall, whose career as an actress was beginning to wane before she took the role in Genevieve). Kendall plays the role of a pampered and spoiled diva to perfection.

The London to Brighton run starts out well for both couples with the scenes along the road, right from the starting line, wonderfully evocative of motoring in England both before 1905 and during the 1950s. We watch as the veteran cars inch their way along the highways and lanes, and deal with the contemporary traffic of the early 1950s.

Unfortunately, McKim's Genevieve has a myriad of problems along the way. When Alan and Wendy finally do arrive it is long after everyone else--including, of course, Ambrose and Rosalind. Claverhouse makes some unflattering comments about McKim's Darracq, inflaming an already seething tension over Wendy's alleged former romantic interest in Ambrose. Thus the two men end up in a wager: the next day they will race back to London with the first across the Westminster Bridge deemed the winner. The stakes: nothing less than ownership of Genevieve.

The race itself, highly illegal and grounds for dismissal from the Veteran Car Club, is where the fun really begins. Each man is determined to win by whatever means necessary and each sabotages the other in every way possible. It is funny and exciting in a sort of gentle 1950's way. In the end, nobody gets hurt, and it's not giving away the story to tell you that McKim gets to keep his beloved Genevieve. (You knew that anyway.)

Originally, director/producer Henry Cornelius wanted to use two English-built automobiles for the movie, but he couldn't convince any owners to let him have their cars for the filming. The French-built Darracq and Dutch-made Spyker finally came available. The irony is that the film was eventually a huge success in the UK and the little 1904 Darracq named Genevieve is now one of the most famous and much-beloved Veteran automobiles in all of England.

The film was also good to its actors, all of whom were already well-regarded in British theater. Kendall's career was revived by the film, More's took off, and Sheridan and Gregson added to their already growing resums. After a slow box-office start, Genevieve won the BAFTA for Best British Film and received an Academy Award nomination for its musical score, which features a lovely harmonica theme played by Larry Alder. The script was written, surprisingly, by an American, William Rose, who managed to get all of the British Veteran Car stuff pitch perfect.

For a long time Genevieve was all but unavailable to American audiences. I recall seeing it once on Saturday afternoon television back in the 1970s. But now it is available on DVD from Carlton Visual Entertainment, digitally remastered and with Dolby digital sound. As this is the 21st century, Genevieve is also available from Amazon's Video on Demand, at $2.99 for a seven-day rental. It is a car movie worth watching and results in about as much fun as anyone could imagine from a charming movie about a 1904 Darracq named Genevieve.

Focusing on the mania which classic car owners have for their vehicles, the story charms us with its humor (I almost wrote ""humour"") and its wholesome humanity, including true love, perseverance, male competitiveness, and fundamental decency. As such, it is a good family film as well, even including a dog among its cast of characters.

The movie itself is typical British comedy of that period, light and whimsical, as two men in different vintage automobiles participate in the annual rally from London to Brighton and back.

A simply delightful romp, and easily one of the best-loved and most inventive British comedies of the post war era, which follows the exploits and misfortunes of two highly competitive friends, as they race against each other in the famous London to Brighton car rally. Alan McKim [John Gregson] stars as a stiff-shirted lawyer, who gets baited by his boisterous friend Ambrose Claverhouse [Kenneth More CBE] to wager a bet on who will win the race. For support, the two car enthusiasts enlist the aid of John Gregsons wife Wendy McKim [Dinah Sheridan] and Kenneth More CBEs companion Rosalind Peters [Kay Kendall] who provides the glamour and much of the comic sparkle. Gorgeous Technicolour photography makes the beauty of the town and country scenes come to life and a wonderfully inventive harmonica soundtrack by Larry Adler, keeps the films pace and everyones spirits in high gear!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: British comedy films of the 1950's are usually synonymous with the Ealing Studios, but one of the most charming of these is the 1953 comedy GENEVIEVE a gentle comedy which ambles about genially without ever quite reaching the lunatic heights of the best Ealing comedy outings. Director Henry Cornelius and especially screenwriter William Rose, who funnily enough being an American, and one with a fairly inerrant eye and ear for what struck Brits as being really funny. GENEVIEVE is the story of two long-time friends who each have a fascination with vintage cars and  they both engage in an annual road trip from London to Brighton and back. Genevieve in case you haven't guessed, is the name of the Alan McKim's car, a beautiful Darracq that has nonetheless seen better days and chooses the most inopportune moments to completely break down. Ambrose Claverhouse, as is perhaps his wont, drives the slightly sportier Spyker which he relishes in zooming past the hapless Alan McKim and Wendy McKim in any of their many ""rest stops"" for repairs along the way.

One of the most beloved British comedies of all time, GENEVIEVE [1953] is a whimsical tale of two couples who drive the London-to-Brighton Vintage Car Rally, and their adventures along the way. Typical of the whimsy is the title which refers not to one of the female characters, but one of the cars, a 1904 French-made Darracq and driven by Alan McKim and Wendy McKim [John Gregson and Dinah Sheridan]. Their friend Ambrose Claverhouse [Kenneth More CBE] brings along a model he's pursuing Rosalind Peterson [Kay Kendall], and the rivalry between the two couples escalates from friendly to manic.

Made on a shoestring, GENEVIEVE was nearly shelved by Rank studio executives who thought it was too bad to release. But it became a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and was one of the most profitable films in the studio's history. The British Film Institute calls the film GENEVIEVE ""the best Ealing comedy that never was,"" not only because the film's irreverent humour is reminiscent of the eccentric comedies produced by the British Ealing Studio in the 1940s and 1950s, but also because of the Ealing Studio connections of Genevieve's creators. Director Henry Cornelius had worked as an editor for French director Rene Clair, and in his native South Africa, before joining the Ealing Studio in 1944 as a producer. Cornelius' first film as director was Passport to Pimlico [1949], after which he left Ealing to become an independent producer and director. American screenwriter William Rose would later write one of the best Ealing comedies, The Ladykillers [1955]. Henry Cornelius even offered  GENEVIEVE to his former Ealing Studio bosses, but was turned down.

GENEVIEVE is not a rip-roaring comedy by any stretch of the imagination, and its very quietness may make it less appealing to those who like their British comedy loud, brash and totally manic. Instead this is a fairly placid look at four people who are involved in an unusual activity. The bulk of the film is focused rather squarely on Alan McKim [John Gregson] and Wendy McKim [Dinah Sheridan] and it is their sparring relationship that drives the film and gives it its humorous energy. Dinah Sheridan and John Gregson have an easy rapport with each other and it's easy to accept them as a long married couple, who have their differences, but who manage to still find the humour in their many predicaments. The ""other"" couple of Ambrose Claverhouse [Kenneth More CBE] and Rosalind Peterson [Kay Kendall] is more sporadically looked at and is there mostly as counterweight to our married ""heroes.""

GENEVIEVE perhaps is too gentle for today's younger [mobile phone obsession] audiences, but it harkens back to a time, especially in the then still recovering British film industry, which had been devastated first by World War II and then by a post-War depression, when simpler joys were more appreciated. But if you take the film on its own kinder, quieter terms, it's a lovely escape to a much simpler times when watching a few misadventures was enough to satisfy most audiences still weary from the calamities which had only then recently subsided.

The film GENEVIEVE has loads of manifold pleasures to recommend it, however, despite its small scale approach and less than insistent approach to humour. The performances are all top notch, and including a wonderful comic cameo performance by Joyce Grenfell as the Hotel Proprietor of a dowdy run-down bed and breakfast hotel that Alan McKim and Wendy McKim unfortunately end up staying the night, with dire consequences. Joyce Grenfell is best remembered for her one-woman shows and monologues, in which Joyce Grenfell invented roles including a harassed nursery teacher, who famously said, ""George, don't do that."" Joyce Grenfell also gained additional popularity as a result of her frequent appearances on the British Television BBC TV classical music quiz show Face the Music. Although Joyce Grenfells humour appeared light and fluffy on the surface, there was often a serious point to be made as well, though Joyce Grenfell did have quite a few film roles to her credit as well, but most of all was very well loved by all age groups and her shows were always a sell-out.

Stand-out moments have to include Rosalind Peters trumpet solo in the club, where she says, ""I'll show them how to tray the plumpet!"" which was actually played by Trumpeter Michael Balfour and the wonderful cameo by Joyce Grenfell as the hotel receptionist, Ambrose Claverhouse's raucous Woody Woodpecker style laugh and the heart-warming finale seeing the car Genevieve rolling off under her own magical steam towards the end. The ridiculous size of Suzie the St. Bernard dog, and the 'flask' incident, which was filmed by the BBC, and of course the ringing of the clock tower bell are all wonderful highlights and of course the brilliant music score by harmonica supremo Larry Adler, does wonders to enhance this beautiful sentimental journey of the film, with the jostling waltz theme and the lyrical ballad interludes.

All in all the film GENEVIEVE requires a modern day audience to take a deep breath and cast away all worldly worries and not ""in your face"" requirements in order to fully appreciate it. Never loud, never obnoxious, but always charming and quietly humorous, and Genevieve, much like its titled car, may be slightly out of date, but for a certain kind of aficionado, that only increases its considerable allure.

Critics compared Kay Kendall's beauty and comedy skills to those of Carole Lombard, and Kendall, like Lombard, went on to a brilliant but tragically brief career. She died of leukaemia in 1959, at the age of 32. Henry Cornelius also seemed poised for a major career, but he, too, suffered health problems, and made only three more films before his death in 1958, at the age of 44. In early 2005, it was announced that Roger Moore would star in a sequel, Genevieve II, playing an aristocrat who takes part in the vintage car race from London to Brighton. Nothing has been heard of that proposed film since. And, no doubt, the many fans of the film GENEVIEVE hope and pray nothing will come of it.

Blu-ray Image Quality  GENEVIEVE is the latest in The Rank Collection title to arrive on Blu-ray from niche label VCI Entertainment, presented with an encoded image of 1080p and a 1.37:1 aspect ratio. The opening scenes almost look like a colorized black and white film, not a luscious Technicolor film from the 1950's. The sky is white, the backgrounds are various grey scale tones and there's kind of an ""applied"" colour look to the people moving through the frame. Then when we get to Alan and Wendy's house, things perk up reasonably well, though Wendy's lipstick almost looks three dimensional, again slightly weird, though reds in the rest of the scene are solid. Finally once the main part of the race starts, we get something approaching a decent high definition image, though skies are still strangely white-grey a lot of the time, even though others blues in the image are very robust and well saturated. Some of this seems to be dependent on different lenses used in the original filming. Close-ups look sharpest and have at least acceptable fine detail, while midrange and far shots are noticeably softer and for some strange reason do not sport the same level of colour saturation, as does some fairly noticeable edge enhancement.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Never trust a cover insert or for that matter menus on the discs themselves, as I was ready to get very negative view towards VCI Entertainment for loss of a Dolby Digital audio options, until I utilised my display button on my remote and discovered that though the disc menu claimed Dolby Digital mixes, what we actually have is the original mono track delivered via a 2.0 LPCM mix, and an okay repurposed surround mix, courtesy of a 5.1 LPCM mix. My preference is to stick with the original mono audio track, which provides good fidelity and there seems very little damage or hiss. Others may want to opt for the occasional discrete channel effect which the 5.1 track does manage to convey. Larry Adler's brilliant composed score is slightly expanded as well, though it sounds like some of that was accomplished with artificial reverb added to the basic stems. One way or the other, the dialogue is very well presented in both of these audio tracks, and the overall sound mix in both of them is also very good as well.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The Carlton Film Collection A Profile of GENEVIEVE [2011] [480i] [1.33:1] [24:04] This is a very worthwhile documentary on the making of the film GENEVIEVE, which includes interviews with different people that were involved in the film. We get some great anecdotes about the director Henry Cornelius, what it was like shooting in the terrible unpredictable British weather, where it rained a lot, as well as other challenges faced by the production crew, but despite the difficulties, everyone loved working in this essential classic British comedy film. Plus we get to see both of the classic cars, that are still going strong today in Holland and it also shows us the guest appearances they do around the United Kingdom which the British people show a lot of affection and love for these classic cars and of course we get a selection if clips from the film and some behind-the-scene black-and-white promotional photographs. Contributors include: Dinah Sheridan [Actress], Clive Donner [Film Editor], Chris Challis [Director of Photography], Larry Adler [Composer/Musician], Rob Appels [Het National Autombielmuseum] and Theo Vandelft [Autotron].

Special Feature: Photo Gallery [2011] [1080p] [1.37:1] [6:50] Here we have a very nice collection of film posters, studio images and film locations, as well as hand coloured Front of House stills from the film GENEVIEVE. While viewing the images you get to hear the actual sound of the orchestra that you heard in the film, where Kay Kendall payed the trumpet, as well as other composed music from the film.

Special Feature: Promo Trailers [1080i] [1.78:1] [5:30] Here you get presented two Original Theatrical Trailers, which are Campbells Kingdom [1957] and Hot Enough For June! [1964] This last film was cut by twenty minutes and retitled Agent 8 for the US release by the American distributor Central Distributing. These titles are available on Blu-ray via the VCI Entertainment Company.

Finally, the film GENEVIEVE is definitely a great British veteran car romp that trundles onto this beautiful looking Blu-ray disc with a very good looking 1080p encoded Technicolor image presentation. Chris Challiss three strip Technicolor photography delivers rosy skin tones, verdant English countryside that look in great detail with very nice ambient Technicolor images. Larry Adlers harmonica music is the star of the film with the 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio which carries the cleaned up original mono version and there is of course the optional 5.1 Dolby Digital enhanced sound track. Dialogue is very crisp and clear throughout. A nice Making of documentary and Photo gallery helps to make this Blu-ray a nice package. The film itself is a jolly good jaunt from London to Brighton and back with two fiercely competitive friendly couples, which simply exudes great period charm. While the real stars are two vintage cars, Kenneth More, John Gregson, Dinah Sheridan and Kay Kendall bicker and provide great amusement for the audience. That is why I have always loved this film from when I saw it released in the cinema and as soon as it was released on the DVD format, I had to purchase it. But now I have finally got the ultimate version on a beautiful Blu-ray disc and have now gone pride of place in my other VCI Entertainment Blu-ray Collection and you will be sadder to not own a copy, so don't delay and go ahead and purchase this brilliant Blu-ray disc. Very Highly Recommended!
