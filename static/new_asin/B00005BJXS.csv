7938007,3,B00005BJXS,"Ahna Capri as The Specialist was quite special.  She was outstanding in this film, as was Adam West.  It was a steamy. lusty film with lots of nudity.

The ending was a shocker.",1522886400,,177,4.303030303030303
7938008,3,B00005BJXS,"Pike Smith (John Anderson) was an attorney for the Water Company of San Clemin, California. He opposes change and is replaced by the flashy Jerry Bounds (Adam West). He brings some kind of lawsuit...to end the privatization? I am not sure. Pike hires a PI (Harvey Jason) to follow Batman around. He has an idea...bring in a ringer on the jury, a hot woman who can seduce the cape crusader and get him disbarred. Enter Londa Wyeth (Ahna Capri) a buxom blonde. Now the strings they pulled  to get her to be a resident and in the jury pool were not discussed in detail. It just happened.

This is an odd film. None of the characters were likable except for Bailiff Hank Kimball (Alvy Moore) who is always likable.

In addition to Ahna Capri sharing her goods, so does Christiane Schmidtmer, the ""Boeing Boeing"" stewardess and former Playboy and Max Factor model. Lou Rawls sings the opening song. Based on a book, ""Come Now The Lawyers."" Camp style fun with major plot holes. Fitting ending. Available on multi-packs.",1475020800,,1014,4.685393258426966
7938009,5,B00005BJXS,This is one of the best movies of the era. She was a little known icon. Todays women can barely touch the class of this truely lovely lady. I am so glad that I took the opportunity to experience the charm and grace of this extremely dedicated individual.  An aged in the wood woman. A duchess in the business of entertainment.,1349049600,,326,4.344262295081967
7938010,3,B00005BJXS,"Adam West, dated seventies fashion and gratuitous nudity as only the seventies delivered in an overly earnest overripe soapy story of lust, conivance and betrayal.
This no-frills DVD definately has a narrow audience but that audience is bound to relish it.",1010188800,3,256,5.2682926829268295
