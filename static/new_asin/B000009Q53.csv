This is an excellent tale of court intrigue. In addition to Ivy Ling Po, veteran actor Ching Miao also shines as the famous black-faced Judge Pao. Another Asian movie queen Li Ching appears in a guest spot as a ghost. We also see two veteran actresses Ouyang Sha-fei & Kao Pao Shu playing 2 rival empresses.
