7883135,4,6305121176,"This continuation of the Airbats story line is just about right.  While the I would have liked it to be a bit longer, it is just fine.
This video contains two episodes.  In the first one, our troubled troop embarks on a  much needed vacation when they find that their resort is haunted!  Or is  it?  Buy this video and find out.  In the second episode, the USAF's  aerobatics team the Thunderbirds pay a visit to Iruma AFB to fly along side  Haneda, Mitaka, and the others.  But not before getting into a fight with  each other resulting in one of the Thunderbirds getting injured!
In all,  801 TTS Airbats 2nd Strike is put together well, but I feel that at least  one scene's funny situation was lost somewhere in the translating process.  The Sub version might clear that up.  The funniest scene, IMHO, is when we  get to see a sake drunk Sgt. Youko.
If you enjoyed First Strike, then  Second Strike is for you.  Go ahead and make the purchase.  Mitaka and  Haneda is waiting for you; they have MUCH to show you - I promise.  ^_^",963532800,,1032,4.354497354497354
