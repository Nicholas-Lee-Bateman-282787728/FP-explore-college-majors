8646861,5,B00IZMO51U,"Absolutely incredible! The creators ""knocked it out the park"" with Star Blazers 2199. Star Blazers 2199 covers the gaps, answer questions, and eliminates wasteful episodes (Balanosaurus/Magnetron Wave) from the original series. I didn't think it was possible, but Desslok is even more ruthless than before and Lysis, long thought to be a fanatic,is portrayed in a different light. A MUST buy for all Star Blazer fans.",1468540800,,417,5.333333333333333
8646862,5,B00IZMO51U,"Awesome and nicely crafted. Pricey for what it is, but some of us can't wait. Not sure what is limited about the edition. I love what this is and in as much as we cannot have the original series on DVD, this will do. And do quite nicely.",1440720000,,237,3.9583333333333335
8646863,4,B00IZMO51U,"In Japanese with English subtitles.  I thought it was going to be in English and bought this for my disabled son, who cannot read.  It should be marked as subtitled.",1437609600,3,165,4.466666666666667

8646865,5,B00IZMO51U,They did a great job revamping this and can't wait to see the rest of them.,1406332800,,75,3.75
8646866,3,B00IZMO51U,I love the old series so I thought I would try the new series it was ok wish it was in English and I like the animation and the  computer animation war real good but you could tell when it was shifting between the two it need to be more seam less if they do and English version I would buy it still love the old series the best.,1405728000,4,328,3.753623188405797
