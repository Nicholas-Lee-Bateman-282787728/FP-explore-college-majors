64128,1,0783240066,I was so looking forward to this movie.  What a disappointment. It was NOTHING like the first movie.  I guess a good (great)act is hard to follow.  If your looking for a good fantasy movie I recommend the origional  Dragonheart or Excalubur.  If your thinking about purchasing this movie  PLEASE rent it first to see if you like it.,966384000,2,332,4.5423728813559325
64129,3,0783240066,This movie could have been better. Or not . Anyway the movie does have it`s ups and downs . It`s ups 1# nice martial arts scenes  2# Cool plot  twist everything comes together at the end. 3# Nice mythology. The Downs (  there are many) 1# No real explantion for Drake `s exsitits 2# Stableboy  and dragon could have been done by other actors 3#You don`t see a true  friendship between the boy and the dragon till much later in the movie.  4#Things are a bit sketching with the plot at frist. 5# Draco and bowen a  not talked about very much. 6# when they are things sound really off. 7#  Could have been longer 8# Can never live up to the original.,966211200,,648,4.211382113821138
64130,1,0783240066,I was gonna write a review about this bad sequel but then i saw your rewiew dracaa and i just couldt have sayd it better ... if you are thinking  of buying this movie because you where a fan of dragonheart (which is btw  the best movie i have ever seen) then read dracaa's review above and don't  say whe didt warn you.,966211200,2,319,4.031746031746032
64131,4,0783240066,"If you're looking for something like the first movie you're going to be disappointed. This is a completely different story aimed at families with  children with simple morals about friendship and deception. On it's own  it's a good family movie with some good action scenes. Rona Figueroa's  martial arts were immensely entertaining to my family. The film's climax  was a surprise.
Both of the film's protagonists were so naive that it had  me squirming to watch them fall into the clutches of the evil and deceptive  Osric.
The session Drake has with Kwan on learning to breathe fire is a  hoot!
The costuming and sets were on a par with the original. I enjoyed  seeing more of beautiful Slovakia.
There seemed to be some hinting around  at the end that suggested there might be yet another movie in the offing. I  am interested in what sort of story they might have in mind. I would like  to see Drake with a better developed set of horns!
There are a couple of  faults I find with this movie: I would have liked to have seen more of  Drake and a longer fight scene at the end. The animation was not as fluid  as the original Dragonheart. It wasn't awful either. I felt the story was a  good one; a longer film would have fleshed it out more.
The original  Dragonheart stands alone in its genre. I don't think another film will be  made that is up to it's par.
I appreciate that the producers of A New  Beginning did not try to duplicate the first movie; they went in a  completly different direction and told a story that is family friendly and  satisfying in it's own right.
Four stars for a solid family film.",966038400,20,1614,4.4436860068259385
64132,3,0783240066,"An odd little sequel that really isn't a sequel at all.  The original  DRAGONHEART was a surprisingly sweet film Staring Dennis Quaid as a  reluctant, down on his luck knight of old, at first battling, then  eventually joining forces with a real live dragon (voiced by Sean Connery).  This movie keeps the name and the dragon concept but loses everything  else.  Made for kids, this is the story of Geoffrey (Chris Masterson), a  young stable boy, who dreams of being a knight.  By chance, he discovers  and befriends a scaly, rascally dragon named Drake (voiced by Robby  Benson).  Together, with some help from a mysterious Asian man and his  feisty kung-fu fighting ward, they seek to free their kingdom from the evil  influence of a ne'er do well advisor hell-bent on destroying Drake and  taking over the realm.
I can't honestly see why this film was made  except maybe to capitalize on the kid popularity of the original film, but  it's a second rate movie at best with some lighthearted moments thrown in  here and there.  It's not that this is a bad film - it's just a bit  redundant.  I'd stick with the original to show your kids.  Or better yet,  go introduce them to Harry Potter instead.",965865600,12,1200,4.636363636363637
64133,3,0783240066,"This Movies was interesting. you don't really need to see the first one to  enjoy it. Although there is some action i wished we could see the dragon,  Drake, more often and that the Dragon battle at the end would last longer.  Otherwise this movies was pretty good.",965865600,2,265,4.479166666666667
64134,1,0783240066,"Blech. That's probably the best thing I can say about this video. The original movie ""DragonHeart"", of which I am a huge fan, is a  movie with an interesting premise: the last dragonslayer and the last  dragon team up together to defeat an evil king and free his people from  slavery. Aided by a fiery peasant girl and a priest, they ultimately bring  victory . . . at a cost. (Check out the movie reviews at Amazon.com for a  more detailed plot.) One of the neatest things about  ""DragonHeart"" was the simple premise of the last dragon and the  last dragon-slayer together. So, I ask you, how can there be a sequel to  the movie when it was about the _last_ dragon?  There are no more dragons  in the world after ""DragonHeart""; just in the stars and in our  hearts. It quite upset me to see the producer cheapen the effects and  meanings in the first movie in order to produce a rather cheezy sequel. The  plot is simple; a young boy training for knighthood meets a young dragon,  Drake. Don't ask me where _he_ came from; _Draco_ was the _last_ dragon in  DragonHeart!  There is a problem----the dragonette can't fly. Together,  they must learn how the dragon is to fly, but also overcome an evil ruler.  Not the most fascinating plot, but it's certainly a sad substitute for the  original movie. Not to mention the fact that the special effects are no  where near as magical as in the first movie; at times Drake almost appears  to have a black outline around him, and his movements are jerky and  sometimes unnatural. I will say this, the acting seems decent; but the  actors are not given much to work with! I have a great respect for the  writer, Charles Edward Pogue, who did the first movie. I don't believe he  wrote the plot or script for the second movie, and I'm willing to bet it  wasn't anything he ever had in mind. This movie, quite simply, does not fit  in the DragonHeart-Universe; the two movies are not compatible. Who needs a  sequel like that?  When a cheaply-done, childish sequel like this comes  along, it will definetly ruin the effects of the original. So if you want  more DragonHeart, read the novelization of the first movie; an excellent  book, in some ways better than the film. But don't waste your time with  this movie. Draco would _not_ approve.",965865600,22,2281,4.525798525798526

64149,4,0783240066,"A shortsighted knight (Dennis Quaid as Bowen) is so wrapped up in his own love of the Old Code of chivalry that he fails to notice that his student, prince Einon, is every bit as evil as his tyrannical father King Freyne, and has absolutely no interest in maintaining any code of ethics.  Bowen blames dragons for this sad lacking in the young prince, because a dragon gave part of his heart to save the wretched boy.  Instead of dealing with the problem at hand, Bowen sets about causing the extinction of dragons.  The last one he sets his sights on is Draco (Sean Connery), the very dragon that supposedly made the boy evil with his heart.
As a morality play this film is par for the course.  It glosses over the more troublesome aspects of the story in favor of a lot of comic relief.  Peasants are slaughtered, the new king (David Thewlis as the adult Einon) is a butcher intent on immortality, his mother (Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn) plots to undo her mistake, theres an attempted rape, and various murders.  Meanwhile, Bowen and Draco seek to fleece the local yokels with a scam not unlike the plot of The Reluctant Dragon!

The sequel was very much an offering for children, producer Raffaella De Laurentiis made that very clear.  And it plays like a live action cartoon.  The plot is limited in scope.  A stable boy (Christopher Masterson as Geoff) dreams and schemes of becoming a knight.  He is encouraged in his delusion by the EVIL Lord Osric who has dreams and schemes of his own, which involves revenge and taking over the kingdom!  The sole purpose of this movie was to resurrect dragons, which had been made extinct thanks to the dragon-hunter in the first film.  It serves its purpose and little else.",1485820800,,1724,4.594771241830065

64192,4,0783240066,"There is something about dragons that is irresistible. You add Dennis Quaid to that and you have an action movie with flights of fancy and loads of entertainment. In the original, a knight who sees the old ways of the code and the measure, a system of honor, being abandoned. He begins to train the prince in the code and the measure to continue the ways of honor. The prince is dying and the knight asks a dragon for a piece of his heart to save the prince. The dragon complies hoping the prince will bring back honor. The Prince becomes the epitome of evil. The knight blames the dragon heart for turning the prince to evil. He begins slaughtering dragons until the only one left is the one who donated the piece of its heart. The two meet and it is nonstop action as they face each other and the prince Dragonheart 2, A New Beginning, is the best of the series. In this one, the knight visits the cave of Draco, that last dragon, long dead. There he finds an egg which he takes to a monastery for safe keeping. The egg is found by one of the initiates and the adventure begins.",1468627200,2,1080,4.273170731707317

Adult Dragonheart fans will have a tough time sitting though it.  Visually, there are three or four very short scenes there the lighting and color look professional, the rest of the time, looking like cheap video tape with too many fake sunlight projections on a back screen rather than a real sky and overly lit face closeups with glowing makeup.  Acting is abysmal on everyone's part EXCEPT the two Chinese characters who stole every scene they were in and made the movie bearable for a few minutes.  Another exception to the mediocrity is the extremely well choreographed martial art combat scenes which were creative, convincing and funny without being silly.

Three stars for the Chinese actors and martial arts (if the movie had been about them I would have given it a four) and two and a half for entertaining grade school kids without obvious gore and two stars for being such a slog to watch otherwise with cheesy dialog, really bad acting on the part of the other leads, and and even worse animation of the dragon.  Calling it a B- would be generous.

Skip this one and go on to the third movie in the series where they got everything right once again minus Dennis Quaid.

The movie is very well done and they put a LOT of effort to capture the true Connery as Draco. They watched all his other films to obtain samples of motions and facial displays to build a Draco that would act perfectly with the voice they gave him and all before the new mapping tech we have.

The sequel is a bit too predictable for me. It started alright but fell down about half way in for me. Overall I still think having both in a single dvd (2 sided) is better then paying the same for just the first.",1380067200,,626,4.1735537190082646

64429,4,0783240066,"Many generations have passed since Draco gave his life to end the tyrannical reign of Einon, and Bowen has passed into the afterlife. The Kingdom is now under the command of a senile ruler whose right hand is the handsome, persuasive, and often vile Lord Osric (Harry Van Gorkum). Not far from the castle walls is the monastery, where young Geoff (Christopher Masterson) serves willingly the abbot. Befriended by a novice of the monastery, his task of cleaning the stable is often a curtain for his training exercises. But born to a life of poverty, he can only dream of knighthood.

Unknown to Geoff -- and even the king -- before Bowen's death, he was sent to the cave of Draco to retrieve a secret the dragon had kept hidden: an egg. Giving it into the care of the Father Abbot, this baby dragon is kept cloistered away in the dungeons below, living out his life surrounded by flickering candlelight and a library of knowledge. One of the brothers has been given the task of feeding him, and one day Geoff senses something amiss. Snatching the key, he follows the dark path downward, attracted by the sight of Bowen's sword, laying in the cavern below. The pair inevitably meet and become secret friends. Drake is still young, not fully grown, unable to fly or breathe fire. In him Geoff finds a true confident and the pair become almost inseparable. In the meantime, a gnarled old man and his ward have come from the Orient, sensing the approaching of the two-tailed comet spoken of in prophecy. On the night it passes a great evil will seize control of the North through the last living dragon's heart. The monks, who have long known of this prophecy, keep Drake's existence a secret and the travelers are sent on their way by Lord Osric.

Remaining unconvinced, they linger in the countryside and catch a glimpse of Drake on one of his rare excursions out of the monastery. Osric has also discovered the dragon's presence and demands he become protector of the realm, with Geoff as his first knight. The boy is flattered, the dragon naive, and the night of the two-tailed comet is fast approaching. There will be a dramatic, climatic clash of the forces of good and evil... and the fate of the dragons will forever be decided. Overall the critics have deemed this sequel to the box-office success a complete failure, but it's a cute and unpredictable film aimed toward children. Unlike most made-for-video sequels, A New Beginning actually has a somewhat believable premise and a twist ending. It manages to be both fun and meant for kids without straying into corny special effects or daft dialogue. True fans of the original may be a bit put off by the obvious alteration in the age-group of this film but nevertheless the film has good special effects and some rather endearing moments... like when they attempt to teach Drake to blow ice. The violence is much more below-the-screen and less graphic than the original, although there's a great deal of martial arts on the part of our two Oriental visitors, who eventually play a large role in the revelation of the true fate of the dragons. One somewhat creepy visual includes a dragon morphing from another life form and the sight of a shriveled heart.

The biggest flaw in the production aside from some at times rather stilted acting is the absence of Sean Connery. His Draco was a lovable yet terrifying, realistic personification of what many of us believe dragons were like. Robby Benson, who does the voice of Drake, just doesn't have the presence; his dragon is younger and less charismatic. The first film towers above the sequel, both in script and character development; but this film isn't entirely out of the equation. The best way of looking at it is not as a sequel but a dragon fairy tale for the younger generation somewhat less dark than its predecessor.",1332892800,,3831,4.723467862481315
64430,3,0783240066,"This is a comfortable, reliable movie that delivers a suitable story for the younger viewer, say between 7 and 15 perhaps. I can see a viewer in that age range enjoying this movie whereas adults may find it rather predictable and boring. The appearance of the dragon is more similar to a children's cartoon dragon than the dragons that scare you by their appearance. This dragon talks more like an innocent child which is what he's supposed to be.

If you have children in the household or as frequent guests, this could be a good baby-sitter type of movie but not much more.",1332201600,,575,4.58252427184466
64431,5,0783240066,Both of these movies are fun and well-done - having them together was just icing on the cake!!  I love the medieval times and the acting in both is great.,1327881600,,154,4.133333333333334
64432,1,0783240066,"I am a big fan of the original when I was small and I remember picking this sequel up at a Borders and begging my father to buy it when I was in my pre-teen years. I remember my eyes lighting up when I saw it on the shelf...I wish my eyes never even glimpsed it. I was so excited to watch the movie sequel...what I got was a major disappointment. I could let the whole ""son of Draco"" thing pass because in the first movie Draco comment about Bowen killing the ""scarred one"" and mentioning she was a female so its possible they could have had an egg together. It does give a opening to a hatchling through that loop hole. However, what bothered me about the movie was that I remember it being boring. Its been years and I haven't seen this movie in a very long time. I think the number of times I have seen this movie was twice compared to the original Dragonheart in which I saw hundreds of times. The most disappointing part of the movie that I remember was that the climax was a big let down. They build it up and it looks promising. The climax fight lasts at most...a few minutes and then the movie is over. I remember thinking that this movie was not worth the money my dad paid. I actually felt bad asking my dad to buy me it. It is a terrible movie and I say watch the original and let this one stay on the shelf.",1327708800,3,1319,4.076923076923077
64433,5,0783240066,I like Dragonheart: A New Beginning. I think it's neat that Draco has a son named Drake. I also think it's neat that Lord Osric is really a dragon in human form.,1319932800,,161,4.0625
64434,4,0783240066,"This DDD(dreaded double sided disc) has on it two movies Dragonheart(May/96)and the second of the franchise films, A New Beginning(Aug/2000).The first is by far the best of the pair. It has the best acting,best story and most heart of the two.
Dragonheart finds us in 984AD and Knight Bowen(Dennis Quaid) teaching a young and future king about sword fighting and the ways of the old code. When the young lords father is killed in a village during a sacking,his young inexperienced son rushes to his aid only to have his heart pierced and ends up fighting for HIS life. His mother(Julie Christie)takes him and Bowen before a dragon(later named Draco and voiced beautifully by Sean Connery),so the dragon may give the (now)young king half his heart to save him. Before doing so the king must swear an oath to the old ways and this he does.
Time passes and the young king has grown,but he has turned into a veritable monster and is despised by the population. Bowen blames the kings disposition on the Dragon and vows from then on to rid the land of every living dragon. This he does,meeting up with a priest/bard named brother Gilbert along the way(Peter Postlethwaite).His quest to kill all dragons comes to pass,all that is except one;12 years on. In fact the two eventually form a partnership so Bowen can make money `ridding` the locals of their newly acquired dragon menace. Time and bad luck eventually outs Bowen and Draco`s scheme,and they must flee. Draco takes Bowen to Avalon,and amongst the tombs of the Knights of the Round Table. Bowen has a vision that night and restates his vows to the old code he had foresaken. He also learns that Draco was the one to give the corrupt king his heart and set him on his quest to kill dragons in the first place. Draco said he knew the young boys deceitfulness but had hoped to turn him to good.
Bowen and Draco`s adventures eventually lead them back to the corrupt king and the inevitable showdown. Draco is captured and Bowen,with the help of an uprising of villagers,storms the castle. Bowen reaches Draco but at a pivotal point must decide to kill Draco AND the king or just the king. Draco dies,as does the evil king,but Draco ascends into the heavens and turns into a star to join his long dead brethren in the Draco constellation.
Comes the end of this film and there is not a dry eye in the house,it is that moving. If there had been anything like a weak supporting cast surrounding Quaid,or Quaid has been weak in his delivery,this movie I don`t think would have done that well. He`s the American,with the lead role,trying to affect an English accent and not doing that well at it,but he somehow pulls it all off,and then some. He is surrounded of course by a brilliant English cast,the least of which is veteran Peter Postelthwaite the Priest/Bard. While there is a serious line of story to this film there is plenty,and thankfully so,alot of comedy and lighter moments thrown in for good measure throughout. Bowen`s quest to kill Dragon`s is many times hilarious,and gets even more so in his `duels`with Draco. Sean Connery of course breaths full life into his voicing of the dragon and lends the creature a believable and distinguished air that few others could have matched. And let us not forget music man Randy Edelman`s beautiful scoring of this film.
Dragonheart:A New Beginning is really Dragonheart-lite. It was a film obviously designed for the small fry and the acting,story and the CGI dragon shows it. It takes place some years after the first film and the location is at the Monastery where Brother Gilbert and Bowen lived until they passed away. It seems Bowen found a dragons egg in Draco`s cave and they brought it to the monastery for safe keeping. The egg has since hatched and the remaining brothers have vowed to keep it a secret. In the meantime a so called knight of the old code is co-ruling the kingdom along side a king which he keeps drugged;listening to his advice only. In comes a pair from the Orient seeking info on the dragon and a two tail comet(signifying the dragons tail)which will fly overhead in eight days. They are not welcome but stick around nonetheless. A stable boy at the monastery becomes fast friends with the dragon(voiced by Robbie Bensen)and it soon becomes apparent that the knight of the old code is actually out to get a piece of the dragon`s heart so he can become immortal. His tricks don`t work but when the knight obtains the old heart of an ancient dragon that was the first evil one,that the Orientals carry,he becomes that dragon. He tries to talk the monastery dragon into joining him and ruling the world but he doesn`t fall for it. He ends up being able to kill the evil one by turning him into ice which shatters. His stable boy friend however is mortally wounded and he gives part of his heart to him and they become irrevocably joined forever.
The ending to the film goes by in less than five minutes,as if someone suddenly realized they were running out of film or just couldn`t think of anything else to prolong it. As I mentioned the story is really geared for smaller fry and this is especially noticeable with the dragon itself,as it has all these soft round edges to it and looks as cuddly as a cute plush toy. And Bensen`s voice just enhances the good,touchy feely vibe it gives out. The acting is alot weaker in this one too,especially our leading character in stable boy Geoff(Chris Masterson),who couldn`t carry lunch let alone a leading part. The so called old code Knight is also about as menacing as a stale sandwich as he grunts and groans his way through this film. A New Beginning is NOT what fans of the first movie would expect to see,and in going after the small crowd it took out any heart the first gave to the second and kept it well hidden. It is too bad.
Technically both movies look good and crisp,the first in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and the second in its`original w/s a/r of full frame(it was a direct to vid film).Extras include:featurettes on the making of Dragonheart one and two,commentary on both,outtakes,trailers,animating the dragon in the second film,and more.
All in all a recommended DVD.NOT for the second film which does the first such an injustice. The first is what you are after and which will satisfy the viewer completely. A solid cast do the honours there,a great musical score and who else but the venerable Sir Sean Connery bringing an unforgettable dignity to the voicing of Draco.",1317859200,,6453,4.666374012291484

The first Dragonheart was a very good movie.  It came out shortly after Jurassic Park and used the same special effects for Draco as the dinosaurs... very cool and Dennis Quaid did a great job as a knight.

The 2nd movie was ridiculous... maybe it was made for TV?  Effects - crappy, Acting - crappy, Story - worse than crappy... It's a shame because the brother from Malcolm in the Middle stars and I like him in general, but this was a kidney stone of a film...

But I found the ending of the original ""Dragonheart"" quite depressing, so I wanted to check this one out anyway.  I actually ended up liking it quite a bit!  This is definitely aimed at a younger audience (in the bonus features, the producer even said that she wanted to do a sequel aimed at a younger audience - and she's the same producer from the original ""Dragonheart""), but I think even some adults will find it entertaining.  It's a good, family-friendly movie, and it does have a much happier ending than the first.  I thought that Drake was actually pretty well rendered, and the costuming and set seemed pretty authentic for a direct to video movie.  Also, the choreography was quite well done in the fighting sequences.  And the scene where Drake is learning how to breathe fire is a riot!  So, taken for what it is, a family-friendly ""boy and his dragon"" story, with themes of friendship and loyalty, I think it's really quite a good movie.  Let's just say I've seen a lot worse.  (And again, it's also good to see if you found the ending of the first movie too depressing).",1292284800,3,1193,4.5327102803738315
64449,4,0783240066,"At the end of the 10th Century, a knight ""of the old code,"" Bowen (Dennis Quaid), is training the young Prince Einon (Lee Oakes) in knightly skills.  Einon's father, King Freyne (Peter Hric), is something of a tyrant, but Bowen believes his teachings of chivalry are taking root in Einon's mind.  But when Freyne is killed and Einon mortally wounded in a peasant uprising, Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie) has him taken to the cave of a local dragon and begs the creature for help.  The dragon shares part of his heart with Einon, who is restored to vigor, but no sooner does he assume the throne than he begins copying his father's style of rulership.  Bowen, blaming the dragon's heart for corrupting his protege, becomes embittered and sets out to kill every dragon he can find.  A decade later he meets the same dragon (Sean Connery), and the two unexpectedly become friends.  It isn't the heart, Bowen learns, that is to blame: the potential for evil was always there in Einon, and would have surfaced anyway.  Drawn into the still-seething peasant unrest, Bowen and Draco (as he names the dragon) make common cause with Kara (Dina Meyer), whose father killed Freyne, but in the end a terrible choice confronts them.

This is perhaps one of the best film fantasies of recent years, thanks largely to Draco--both his CGI physical self (watch the sometimes-awkward, and for that reason very convincing, way he flies) and Connery's splendid voicing.  The ""feel"" of early-Medieval Europe is here too; someone obviously did some research into armor, weapons, and clothing.

Many viewers seem to think the sequel, ""A New Beginning,"" is inferior, but I didn't think so.  Certainly the blame shouldn't fall on Drake (Robby Benson), the new dragon, who is, after all, quite young (only about 20 years out of the egg), and therefore shouldn't look as impressive as Draco.  The sequel takes place some 60 years after the original and focuses on Geoff (Christopher Masterson), a young stableboy who yearns to become a knight.  When he discovers and befriends Drake, who has been raised in hiding in a monastery, his life takes a new turn.  Promised knighthood by the smooth-talking chancellor of the kingdom, Lord Osric (Harry Von Gorkum), and enthralled by a visiting Chinese mystic (Henry O) and his assistant, a disguised princess (Rona Figueroa), he discovers that he and Drake may be the only hope for the failing king (Ken Shorter).  The twist at the end is totally unexpected, and the swordfighting and martial arts sequences are especially good.  If you buy the two-DVD set you should at least give this entry a chance: watch it with an open mind and see if it doesn't have some real points going for it.",1285718400,4,2703,4.843478260869565

64468,5,0783240066,"First of all, this review is directed to the double-bill version of the DVD, which contains on a double-sided disc the original widescreen movie and alas, also its worse, ""meant"" for TV, cousin, for which I only give two stars for the effort.

Sean Connery, although just in voice, steals the show from anyone else in the movie. And how could it be else?

It is as if they wrote the character of Draco, the dragon, fitting it to him and his skills as an actor. A true one at that.
Pity he retired, but when one thinks about what Hollywood offers nowadays, with perhaps a few exceptions, it is more than comprehensible.

But back to this tiny gem of a movie.

It has the style and the flavor of the old good tales of Merlin, Arthur and his good Table Round, combined with an intelligent twist on the myth of Dragons.

There is plenty of action in it, as well as drama, comedy and the eternal ""good vs. evil"" theme.

But the difference lies in how the story was developed.

It is not taken from the usual comic-book style as is the habit of many unimaginative movie-makers today, but rather interwoven with Celtic myth and often referring the ""Old Code"" of the, by now gone, fellowship of Knights devoted to justice and righteousness introduced by King Arthur, a few decades earlier.

It is the story of real friendship, faith and character strength, but it never turns itself into a preachy piece of moralizing babble.

It simply ""shows"" us these virtues in motion.

It is a movie for the entire family and can even be watched by unattended children.

It is a well-layered movie that flows like water and never gets boring.

This is also a thinking man's movie, despite its mythological contents and highly adventurous action scenes.

Like Draco, this movie belongs among the stars for nobleness and purity of Heart.

It goes beyond religious beliefs or moral tales, it is a very well studied weave of a tale, told by someone who knows what it is required from a skillful storyteller.

Alas, the second movie is not as well written or intelligent as the first one, and is forgettable at best, being just another adventure outing.

I would have dropped the second altogether, since it does not add to the glitter of the first one, but for completeness-sake, we might forgive Universal and think that a comparison is in order.

A comparison between true Art and purely commercial endeavor and the usual ""milking the cow"".

With Sean Connery, we get Dennis Quaid as a Knight of the ""Old Code"", played fairly well by him, considering he also starred in movies like ""Enemy Mine"" which had a very similar approach, Peter Postlethwaite, whose skills as an actor are undisputed and the legendary Julie Christie, who in a secondary role, shines as usual.

When we talk about Art, we also must remember the music of a movie, and this one has a very lovely score composed by the very talented Randy Edelman.

In my humble view, this is a must buy DVD for the entire family.

If you like the Dark Ages, its histories, myths and tales of Chivalry, then this one should belong in your shelves together with ""The Mists of Avalon"", ""Excalibur"", ""Knights of the Round Table"", and ""Dragonslayer"" (another wonderful installation on the theme, starring a very young Peter MacNichol and an old veteran like Ralph Richardson, master of actors).

Take your pick, but remember that this movie (Dragonheart) in its Widescreen scope (2.35:1) and excellent DD 5.1 Surround sound is well worth the effort.

After watching the movie, if you have the chance, take a stroll, raise your nose up to the night sky and contemplate the stars, then simply start dreaming...",1220832000,,3635,4.680817610062893

64515,4,0783240066,"After watching ""Rising Sun"" last night I had the luck to spot ""Dragonheart: A New Beginning"" on the Sci-fi channel.  I've always been a fan of Dragons, and the original Dragonheart made such an impact on me that I just had to see this sequel, no matter the fact that it was billed as a 'family movie'.
...
The original Dragonheart was a masterpiece of a comedic tragedy; it dealt with issues like fun, friendship, love and spirituality, yet it also covered racial violence, genocide, guilt, sacrifice, and death.  The end is a tear-jerker for a lot of people.
By contrast, ""Dragonheart: A New Beginning"" comes across as a movie that would be suitable for kids as young as 7-8 if they're not frightened by no-gore violence and characters getting put in ""scary"" situations.  When I say no-gore violence I am specifically referring to the only ""battle"" seen in the movie where the only blood you see is on the tip of one spear.  There are also a couple kung-fu fights.  But, while there are a lot of bodies, you don't see any blood!
Being a family movie, everything is naturally light-hearted and never too serious because most of the action is predictable.  However, this comes back to bite it in the climax of the movie as some of the characters act way out of character.
The main human character is Geoff (a stable boy at a monastery) who discovers and ""makes friends with"" the young nave dragon Drake.
""Dragonheart: A New Beginning"" comes in at 85 minutes in contrast to the 103 minutes of the original, and unfortunately you will notice it - there is not enough real character development between Drake and Geoff to show us why they would care for each other in the way that they do at the end.  Up until the end, the relationship between the two is strictly kid/pet, with Geoff being cocky and self-centered and taking advantage of his close friendship to the nave dragon to advance himself, which the bad guy plays on.  Eventually, the desires of the bad guy are revealed and Geoff ends up `saving' Drake from a deadly situation which Geoff got him into in the first place, and Drake saves him while they both escape.
After their escape from the bad guy and directly up to the final confrontation is a long scene in which the secondary characters escape from their predicament and uncover another facet of the bad guy's plot.  While the scene itself is decently done and doesn't need to be cut, it overwhelms the escape scene.  It would have been much better for the entire movie if the escape scene beforehand had been expanded to show the forging of a true friendship between Geoff and Drake.  As it is, in the climax when Drake makes his `fatal choice' between good and evil there is no indication that their kid/pet relationship has changed.
A couple people have commented on ""bad acting"" but I have to disagree.  If you look at how the actors show their emotions and believe in their characters it's easy to ignore any technical problems and forget that they're actors - a big plus.
On the other hand, imperfect directing, scripting and editing have led to some nasty plot holes and characters getting out of character in moments that make you want to scream ""WHY DOESN'T S/HE...?!"".  One example of a minor plot hole is when Drake discovers the typical knight/dragon relationship (i.e. dragonslaying) and the entire issue is swept under the rug.  While we as the audience feel sorry for Drake as being the last of his kind and feel anger or guilt towards the activities which killed his race, we never really see Drake respond to the issue, which is a let-down for those of us interested in seeing the movie deal with more serious issues.  Drake also gets FAR TOO LITTLE AIRTIME, making him seem to be a very two-dimensional character in contrast with the beautiful performance of Draco in the first film.
On the technical side, the design of the dragon is very good, the locations and costumes are decently medieval, and the choreography is amazing for a direct-to-video film.  Drake is well-animated most of the time, though his CGI never totally blends with the live-action characters in the way that Draco's did, and some additional CGI in the end seems below Drake's level of refinement.
Overall, the movie's light-hearted tone and musical score, simplistic structure, predictability, transparent characters and surreal childish CGI dragon, not to mention the plot holes that keep it from standing up to the criticisms of adults, lead this movie to be a solid 4/5 star contender with the younger audience in general, 5/5 for being the only good dragon film for kids too young to handle the original Dragonheart, and a 3/5 for everyone else.

Unfortunately, ""A New Beginning"" does not examine its cliches and build a meaningful plot out of them, like the first ""Dragonheart"" did. No, this abominable sequel simply strings cliches together and hopes that something will come out of it. It goes without saying that the film is a total failure.
The plot, in a nutshell: an Orphaned Stableboy with Big Dreams of Adventure finds his way into the Mysterious Dungeon under a Monastery which serves as home for many Dour Monks. Down in the dungeon, Jeoff finds a Young, Insecure Dragon, Drake (who looks very much like an ad campaign for Mattel merchandise). Meanwhile, Lord Osric, a Sheep-in-Wolf's-Clothing, is appointed chief advisor to the Senile King. He's all smiles, but is really plotting to rule the kingdom (serving under a senile king, hasn't he already triumphed?). He's also plotting to conquer the invading ""Teregoths"" (a Nordic people most often seen in hokey fantasy movies). When, against better judgement, Jeoff gets Drake out of the dungeons, Osric sees his chance for fame. Oh, and there's something about an Ominous Prophecy, a Two-Tailed Comet, a pair of Karate Masters from the Orient (one of whom is really a Girl-in-Boy's-Clothing), and so on.
The acting is atrocious. Half of the actors amble about feeling superior to the material. The other half can't act, period (I am reminded of the scene where Lian walks up to the camera, crouches, and speaks directly into the microphone, ""That's the stable boy we saw before""). During some of the major scenes, I intently studied the stitching on the characters' robes (is that ... nylon!?).
Chris Masterson is very much a one-role man: get him a lifetime contract for ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and get on with it.
Oh, and the dragon. The dragon is the worst thing yet. For starters, it doesn't look like a dragon. It's too colorful and its hips are too wide, as if it already is an action figure. Thanks to Robby Benson's efforts, it doesn't sound like a dragon either. Unlike Draco, Drake has no personality, no character outside of what the plot provides, no mystique, and no conviction. He is the essence of un-dragon.
What seems most insulting is that ""A New Beginning"" goes through the motions of fantasy without even believing in itself. No suspension of disbelief is even remotely possible. What we have here for our viewing pleasure (and I use the phrase loosely) is very-much a cash-in, an insipid, pointless movie with neither (pardon the pun) heart nor soul. Its soul has been sold to toy companies and public interest groups that strive to make movies bland, but inoffensive. A heart it never had.",1003968000,9,2708,4.863636363636363
64519,3,0783240066,"This straight-to-video sequel to the 1996 fantasy flick, Dragonheart, centers around a young stableboy named Geoff who has aspirations to become a knight, and Drake, the young dragon that he finds hidden in the basement of a local monestary. How could there be another dragon, one might wonder, since Draco from the original was supposed to be the last? Well, the opening tries to explain this by dismissing it as a miracle - which is probably one of the laziest possible explanations you might ever hear. As the audience, you're supposed to take it for granted.
Speaking of the audience, A New Beginning is decidedly targeted more closely on children than adults - though there are sufficient swordfights, battle situations, and special effects to appeal to many fans of the original as well. Granted, children are going to get more from it than most adults, it's safe to assume, but there are some interesting plot twists (quite amazingly) that make it worthwhile to fantasy fans in general (those who aren't all that picky, I mean). The plot is not the most original or compelling, I hasten to add - it basically consists of a bad guy who wants Drake's heart -  but the fact that anything unexpected takes place at all is a virtue here. And the climax is more fulfilling than it has a right to be.
Don't expect the production values from the original, however. The CGI dragon from the original recalled the dinosaurs from Jurrassic Park with its nearly flawless animation and sense of being-there, but that was Draco, and this is Drake... Drake's animation and texturing is quite good, but hard to compare to the work done in the original Dragonheart. Drake is also considerably smaller than Draco, even though it certainly seems as if he's full grown. In design, though, he is Draco's identical twin.
But it's not just the CGI that suffers from lower production costs. The sets and costumes and pretty much everything else has a decidedly more low-budget flavor. However, for a straight-to-video release, it's not all that unimpressive. It's just that being a sequel to Dragonheart openly invites comparions to the original, and the original was given the full Hollywood treatment with very few expenses spared. Yet, all in all, Dragonheart: A New Beginning is a nice little fantasy production (especially if you're a child) that might deserve a look.",998265600,2,2355,4.902255639097745
64530,4,0783240066,"This movie lived up every bit to the original Dragonheart. And I thought that the thematic continuity with the first movie was sufficient to consider it a true sequel (especially considering that none of the characters carried through to the second film).
It's true, though, that ""A New Beginning"" is a different type of movie than the original, and may a appeal to a different audience. For one thing, the sequel is less violent (reflected in its PG rating, compared to PG-13 for the original.)
For another thing, the original is a very straightforward tale of good against evil, wherein you know immediate who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. ""A New Beginning"", on the other hand, has a more complex plot and character development.
On balance, they're both good movies that have a lot to offer. A sequel doesn't need to be a remake.",998006400,,845,4.677852348993288
64531,3,0783240066,"The first Dragonheart was fantastic in my eyes (don't believe me? Read my review). This one wasn't as good, but it wasn't horrible. It didn't (stink). Those things are not true. It just wasn't as good as the first. As you've read in other reviews, this story is about a stableboy who wants to become a knight, and in the midst of his quest, stumbles on a dragon living in a dungeon (I think). They become friends, and I don't clearly remember the details of the rest. Oh well, someone here can tell you.  I thought Drake was very cute, but truthfully I prefer the older dragons like Draco. If Draco had been around in this movie we could have had Draco and Drake arguing, and that could have been really funny. Compliments on the humor, mostly on Geoffrey's (Chris Masterson) part. All in all, this was a good film, especially for younger kids, and I applaud the people behind the making of it (none of the names are instantly coming to mind). Go see this if you are on the young side, or didn't see the first one, or if you just like dragons and want something nice to watch.",996624000,,1076,4.353233830845771
64532,4,0783240066,"A New Beginning is a good movie with a good polt, but it has a long way to go before it can surpass the original.  The writers did a good job in explaining how another dragon could be alive if Draco was the last.  The story is heartwarming, and the action scenes are good.  The animation isn't as good as the original either.  THis is a great movie for kids to see as it has a good message, but if your looking for another original Dragonheart, then this isn't the mvoie for you!",983404800,,479,4.118279569892473

64534,4,0783240066,"The second installment of the Dragonheart Saga is cleary aimed at a younger audience (although the first movie seems to be aimed for people between 12-30, too). Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed Dragonheart 2: A  New Beginning, concerning the story, characters, CGI Effects (Drake still  looks great altough Draco in the first part looked better :)) and  especially the great and majestic Film Music, composed and arranged by  newcomer Marc McKenzie (5 Stars for the Music,...). The only thing I found negative is that Drake the young Dragon  doesn't really seem to be the main character of the story - he doesn't come  up and show himself very much during the movie. And it would have been good  to have watched Dragonheart 2: A New Beginning in the cinemas, and NOT on  DVD/VHS only. All-in-all: 4 Stars for an enjoying, entertaining and  warm-hearted movie!",967593600,,861,4.965034965034965
64535,4,0783240066,"Do not expect a re-telling of the original film. This sequel is clearly intended for a younger audience, and, when viewed with that in mind, there  is still much to enjoy about the film. I liked that the film makers  included some good messages for younger viewers about family, friendship,  sacrifice, and cautionary messages about the dangers of ambition and  prejudice. The cast does a fine job, without exception, and they are  clearly having fun with the material. The characters are quite likeable and  I liked that they included a strong female lead (played by Rona Figueroa).  The martial arts and swordplay sequences are great. The action is toned  down in deferrence to young viewers though parents should be cautioned that  there are two stabbings which might disturb very young children.  My only  grumble is that I would have liked to have seen the film spend a bit more  time further developing the characters and a bit more to the film's  surprise climax (and there are some good surprise twists in this film). A  good film if you want something fun or if you want something you can watch  and then discuss with your children.",966988800,,1141,4.779487179487179
