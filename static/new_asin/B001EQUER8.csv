3557139,5,B001EQUER8,"This DVD is exactly what I hoped for; I missed a lot of Phelps' historic races during the summer 2008 Beijing Olympics, and this has all 8 gold medal races with the original NBC footage and the call by Rowdy Gaines.  There are interviews after each race with Bob Costas, Phelps, coach Bob Bowan & Rowdy Gaines where Phelps breaks down what was going on in his mind and in the pool during each race.  The breathtaking 4x100 freestyle relay (Jason Lezak's come from behind to beat France) and the 100m Butterfly (Phelps' 0.01 sec win over Michael Cavic), the medal ceremonies, all the rest.  This was the greatest U.S. Olympic moment since the 1980 hockey team win over the USSR.  Everyone American should watch this amazing achievement of a lifetime.",1224288000,27,749,4.694656488549619
3557140,5,B001EQUER8,"This movie showcases Michael Phelps' achievements during the 2008 Olympic Games. The first half of the film shows the events he performed in. His events are followed by interviews and mini-segments aired during his competition(s).

Michael Phelps is accomplishing his goal of introducing and inspiring many to swimming! He's a fantastic athlete who works to inspire a nation. This film places Mr. Phelps in the best light and serves to illustrate his dedication and hard work. While Michael Phelps had the tendency to be ""at a loss for words,"" his performances are driven by his competitiveness. Again, this film works to exhibit the best of Michael Phelps during the 2008 Olympic Games and it serves to remind us all why he's quickly become the best swimming athlete.

Overall, the pieces in this film have been taken directly from what audiences were shown during the Olympic Games with the exception of a few interviews. I would recommend this to any swimming/Michael Phelps fan out there!",1222905600,31,992,5.0426829268292686

3557146,5,B001EQUER8,It had all the races that I wanted to be able to review.  Men's relay is especially inspirational!  What a wonderful investment to pull swimmers into the pool throughout a cold winter.  Lovely tribute to a great athelete.  Timely shipping.,1359763200,,239,4.9

3557149,3,B001EQUER8,"It's great to have all of the races on one DVD, but the picture quality is that of a VHS (remember those?).",1344297600,,107,3.909090909090909
3557150,5,B001EQUER8,We love watching the Olympics and watching these even years later and knowing the outcome was just as exciting.  We are big Michael Phelps fans as well as USA swimming!!  Looking forward to this years Olympics and seeing what we can do!!,1343606400,,237,4.619047619047619

3557152,3,B001EQUER8,"First and foremost, I want to say that I am a huge fan of Michael Phelps. He is an amazing athlete and deserves all the credit in the world. I'm not too crazy about this DVD. This DVD basically shows all the races, which are exhilarating, but that's where it ends. The brief 2 minute interviews do not justify calling this DVD an ""Inside Story"". I would have liked to see more of a focus on Michael Phelps' technique. Nope. No close-ups, no slow-mo's, just the race. They do show some slow-motion at the very end of the race, when it was close, but that's it. I would like to see a DVD focusing on Phelps' training, his upbringing, his hometown... stuff like that would be an inside story but you won't find that here. Just the races...",1307664000,,736,4.340579710144928
3557153,4,B001EQUER8,"Really good video with all the important interviews and races. I was expecting to see something new, never seen before, but there is really nothing exclusive. Anyway, it is good to have for something that is so worthy to remember.",1304121600,,230,4.775
3557154,3,B001EQUER8,"Great to be able to watch all of the amazing final races on one disc. But the DVD was VERY incomplete in that it could and SHOULD have been much, much more as the ""Inside Story of the Beijing Games."" None of the qualifying races were shown and there were no expected extras like the interplay between Michael and Coach Bowman and Michael and the other swimmers, footage from Michael at the Olympic village and from around Beijing, footage of Michael's warm-ups for the races and getting massages between races etc.",1303171200,2,514,4.65934065934066

3557159,4,B001EQUER8,"This is an amazing video.  If you watched just one of his races, you must see this DVD.  His story is great AND they show every race he did.  My family and I spent every night during the Olympics watching swimming and it is great to be able to have all the races to watch over and over again in this DVD.",1230681600,3,304,3.870967741935484
3557160,5,B001EQUER8,"My dad is glued to the couch during the Olympic games. I sent this and the highlights video to him for Christmas and when he opened the box last night he was thrilled!

8299333,5,B001EQUER8,"For those of us that have been in competitive swimming,
both as swimmers and coaches, know what an amazing
feat this was.
It is truly remarkable, and most likely will never happen
again.
Michael was swimming in the ""zone"" at Beijing, and so
many things had to come together at the right time for
that to happen, and they did.
Relive all of the races, and watch something that only
happens a very few times.
Mark Spitz, set the standard, Michael Phelps went passed
it.",1434931200,,467,4.5058823529411764
