2067668,4,B00028G6H6,"This documentary was a tribute to the lady!  I knew that she had been an active first lady but I never realized just how involved she was in so many ways. This film should be shown to students studying American history in high school  Althouth many ""first ladies"" have been activisits, Eleanor Roosevelt, in  my opinion, leads them all!  I know that one can read about this lady but to see her in ""action""....to see her accomplishments....to see her smile...was ever so much more interesting!",1364515200,,492,4.752941176470588
2067669,5,B00028G6H6,"The production values of this 1965 documentary (music, narration and scene transitions) are jarring for we who have become accustomed to PBS and Ken Burns's restrained documentary style. But the material, rich and informative, easily makes up for it. It's wonderful to hear Eleanor Roosevelt speak to us in her own voice, and to have her written work read by a cousin. But best of all is the phenomenal array of archival film and photographic material that seems in almost pristine condition. Eleanor is shown as an ungainly young girl who unaccountably catches the eye of her dapper 5th cousin Franklin. With FDR's ascension to the White House, they become a power couple, with Eleanor making the rounds of the country, becoming the president's eyes and ears (and legs). Eleanor is down-to-earth and human, where FDR could be grandiose and remote. Her journeys around the country and the world, especially during WWII, brought a much-need human touch to the administration. Eleanor's post-war contributions, especially as special ambassador to the United Nations, raised her profile as high as her late husband's and made her a beloved figure.

FDR's cavorting is not covered in this film. 1965 standards would not have allowed it to be mentioned. Nor is much criticism of Eleanor's ""socialist"" opinions. Nonetheless, the woman who emerges from this video is one of warmth and steely strength of conviction. I fell in love with Eleanor Roosevelt because of this film, and hope you do as well.",1362960000,,1493,5.069105691056911
2067670,5,B00028G6H6,"I'd heard things of Eleanor Roosevelt over the years, and have read some of her great quotes.  But I never realized how awesome a lady she was.

2067672,5,B00028G6H6,"I have always admired this woman.  I enjoyed the video very much.  I spent many lovely days visiting  Hyde Park museum, and it bought back pleasant memories.  Young people who have hard beginnings can find stimulation to pick themselves up by the bootstraps.  Also, this woman represented the fact that it is not necessary to look like a model.  Young beauty is short-lived, and it is what's inside that counts!!!!!!!",1361836800,,417,4.885714285714286

2067764,5,B00028G6H6,"I watched this documentary and the 14 hours of Ken Burns's The Roosevelts: An Intimate Story. I was almost 7 years old when FDR died and I recall my mother in tears at his death along with neighbors wh were in the same state. Teddy, Eleanor and Franklin were amazing people and we shave not seen their likes in the world of politics since then. But Eleanor was as intelligent as TR and FDR and she was dedicated to the betterment of humanity. This documentary tells us about a woman who was treated with little to no respect as a child, girl and young woman. But she was fortunate to be sent to school in England. The 3 years spent with the headmistress and other independent you women changed her life and the life of so many Americans. She was her husbands legs and his representative to the poor of this country. Her honesty, frankness and depth of caring showed when she visited the many people suffering from the depression, the dust bowl and WWII. And because she brought her deep and honest concerns back to her husband, Franklin, legislation and executive orders were enacted to help and to help quickly. As people watched the procession during  Franklin's funeral one man fell to his knees. Another man asked him if he knew FDR. No said the man, but he knew me.(Quted from the last episode of the Ken Burns documentary). Those in Congress today lack the compassion of those three special Roosevelts.",1411257600,,1408,4.587301587301587
2067765,4,B00028G6H6,Timely given ken burns series on pbs.  Reminded me of issues and events I have in deep memory and made me aware of things I never knew about ER.  She was a Marvelous advocate for social justice who needs a modern day offspring  to carry on her work.,1411084800,,249,4.145833333333333
2067766,5,B00028G6H6,What a life. The childhood that she led to how she was beloved by all at the end. I so not know that kind of strength that takes but boy did ever come out the other side. Wonderful woman.,1410652800,,187,3.8205128205128207

2067793,5,B00028G6H6,"Understand that this is a documentary, and also that it deals with an extraordinary woman.  She was ahead of her time in so many ways, seeing areas of the economy that needed help she could give, lobbying for child labor laws, and a host of other things.  She married a handsome man because she loved him, and supported him through the many hardships and crises that were part of his life.  After he died, she continued to lend her strengths to causes in which she believed, among them the United Nations.  This is a biography of an amazing woman that held my attention to the end, and I hope that it will help keep her in the history books of the future.",1408320000,,655,4.344262295081967

2067796,5,B00028G6H6,"Archibald MacLeish wrote a very warm and inspiring script. It is refreshing to follow Eleanor Roosevelt's history in a narrative focused truly on her (without extraneous details about others in her life, such as her husband's affair with his secretary). The script is perhaps a tad too fixed on Mrs Roosevelt's unhappy childhood, making the story a kind of psychological ""rags to riches"" tale. The accounts of her achievements and the still photographs and film footage are priceless. And it's good to hear Eric Sevareid's voice from his younger days.",1405987200,,551,5.133333333333334
2067797,3,B00028G6H6,Unless you're a history buff I don't know if you'd really be that interested in this movie but it was enlightening and gave some good insights to what Eleanor was able to accomplish despite some challenging circumstances in her life and being a woman in an era when women weren't listened to or relied on very often.,1405468800,,316,4.56140350877193

2067801,4,B00028G6H6,It was good historical information....covering a bit of WWI and more of WWII....but it could have had more information on Eleanor herself instead of the era.  I would like more information of what she did.,1398470400,,205,4.857142857142857
2067802,5,B00028G6H6,"I am a big fan and have seen or read much material.  Thought I knew it all.  However, I learned a lot from this excellent documentary.  It included my favorite photo of her carrying her own bags across a tarmack.  Most of the other photos were especially unflattering in close ups.  Surely there were a few more flattering ones.  Her childhood shots were just about the saddest images of a child I could imagine which was good and vital a shaping of the film.  It set me wondering about the state of orthodontery over those years.  The Roosevelts could have paid for it, if it were available.  Also omitted were Lucy Mercer and ER's secretary Hickock, very important women effecting ER's self-esteem.  FDR's judgment on bombing the concentration camp trains, speaking out on the lynchings and locking up the Japanese were decisions ER took the opposite pov and argued passionately with him about them. I think this shows vital aspects of her character and re-evaluation of marriage.",1398211200,,982,4.826347305389222

2067804,4,B00028G6H6,"This documentary gave me greater insight into the life of Eleanor Roosevelt from the time she was a little girl to when she became first lady of the land and beyond.  I learned she was an amazing woman ahead of her time.  We need someone like her today.  She was a no-nonsense gal and I admire her for being outspoken, something I think most people don't realize about her.

2067807,5,B00028G6H6,"I am a huge fan of Eleanor Roosevelt.  She has shown us that one person can make a difference.  She stood up to adversity and maintained her principles, helping many people who didn't have a voice of their own. In doing so, she established  inspiration for her fellow women to take big leaps of leadership.  Women had typically been discouraged from performing brave acts in public.  They were treated as being weaker than men and encouraged to be housewives and homemakers basically. Her strength continues to inspire.  This film depicts her life story very well.",1389484800,,564,4.88421052631579
2067808,5,B00028G6H6,"I am so glad I decided to rent this story about Eleanor Roosevelt's life. It begins with her sad , lonely childhood amongst a mother and relatives that really didn't have much use for her and let that be known , increasingly and blatantly. Her father did seem the only one that loved her but he succumbed to alcohol and was sent off to W.Virginia ostensibly to recover sent one or two letters never to be heard from again and dying some 9 or there about years later. She was left alone and shuttled back and forth to her maternal grandmothers home for  5 lonely months of the year ,then back with NEVER any young children to play with. She led an existence and was sent away to England to a French school when she was 16. Such a cold dysfunctional family who saw none of her Roosevelt family ( docudrama  did not say why they didn't pursue their own flesh and blood , appalling to Me)  and when she returned to her ""home"" after awhile she became IN contact with the Roosevelt's side , met Franklin her 5th cousin once removed and it was then her life began. She was a beautiful , wonderful , humane , caring , HONEST lovely person and F.D.R. got the better of the deal. I can't express enough my admiration and feeling of caring for and liking this beautiful soul of a woman and the film brought tears to my eyes several times. How blessed our country was to have Eleanor Roosevelt for our first lady ( along with Jackie Kennedy) . Please see this film , she brought me hope for humanity and I ( being a spiritual person) know she is with our Lord and savior. Affected me very strongly and I know I will think about her for many years to come , just from seeing this film. If I could give HER  more stars I would.",1388880000,2,1713,4.229357798165138
2067809,4,B00028G6H6,"Anything scripted by Archibald MacLeish is going to be good. This is a moving glimpse at American history, and begins with Jack and Jackie Kennedy at Eleanor's funeral. I downloaded it to show to a 5th grade class, and was relieved that, unlike the later Frontline biography, this does not get into some of the more adult dilemmas that Eleanor faced. The parable of the poor little rich girl who discovers social justice provides a nice corrective to our glitz besotted world. One small criticism: the musical score comes from a time when dissonance was more in style than it is now, and in my opinion, has not aged well.

As a teaching piece, this raised all the best questions on the part of my students. They were curious to learn about the World Wars, and they noticed at once how white the world was when Eleanor came of age. I was forced to stop and do a class entirely dedicated to Eleanor and the nascent Civil Rights movement. I was turned back on the Eleanor when I attended a Facing History and Ourselves seminar.

8023727,3,B00028G6H6,"The first quarter of this movie focuses on Eleanor's early life and is very interesting in terms of learning about her. Then the movie shifts into more of a narrative about world and U.S. politics with many news clips only some of which include Eleanor. It is disappointing not to learn more about her behind the scenes role, her personal life and psychology. The Ken Burns documentary about Eleanor is far superior for a more complete picture of her.",1486598400,,451,4.7215189873417724
